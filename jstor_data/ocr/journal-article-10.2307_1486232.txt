<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE: PERSPECTIVES ON "MODERNITY" by ARNOLD J. BAND I The traditional opening statements in the debate concerning the begin- nings of modern Hebrew literature usually assume the form of claims or accusations of paternity. Claims-if the child is legitimate; accusations-if it is not. I wish to avoid the paternity issue because, as I shall argue, it is essen- tially groundless and precludes consideration of other perspectives. My strategy shall therefore be an oblique attack from an unexpected quarter using traditional camouflage, I begin with a prooftext. The Second Temple, completed seventy years after the destruction of the First by Nebuchadnezzar, differed in four ways especially from the Temple of Solo- mon. Though about the same in area, it was not so high. It was also less of a unit, being divided now into an outer and inner court. In equipment and decoration it was barer. Above all, the Holy of Holies was now an empty shrine, as it was also to remain in the magnificent third Temple built by Herod. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 ARNOLD J. BAND The Ark of the convenant was gone, and no one felt at liberty to try to replace it with a substitute. A careful reading should alert the reader to the fact that the author is probably not thinking in normative Jewish terms, in which there are ordi- narily two temples, not three, even though the Temple destroyed in 70 C.E. was by no means the Temple built by Zerubavel in 516 B.C.E., but what the Mishnah and Josephus (Ant. 15:380 ff.) knew as "Herod's Building." Dis- pensing with solicitation of conjectures, I shall simply reveal the source- not really from a history of the Jews, but from W. Jackson Bate's The Burden of the Past and the English Poet, a now classic essay dealing with the difficulties the modern poet felt since the eighteenth century about achieving something new and significant.' Aware of the creative achievements of his predecessors and obsessed with his self-consciousness of the rich legacy of the past, Bate argues, the poet felt the past was a crushing burden which he had to bear and manipulate. The sustained metaphor of the Second Temple-a revealing metaphor in itself-was not, of course, Bate's invention but rather a term current in the literature of the neoclassical period beginning with the Restoration. The employment of biblical tropes is by no means surprising in an age reared on Bible reading and sermons and for whom the most popular poet was unquestionably Milton. Bate extends the figure in his book by calling the romantic period, for him the creative solution of the problems induced by the burden of the past, "The Third Temple." Since England has housed few Hebrew writers of any importance after the readmission of the Jews in the time of Cromwell-Ephraim Luzzatto and Shmuel Romanelli come to mind-one does not ordinarily think of its literary history as a ground for comparison with modern Hebrew literature.2 The known direct eighteenth-century English influences upon Hebrew liter- ature, for instance, are not considerable: Addison and the English periodi- 1.

"Why England?" one might ask. Why begin a discussion of early modern Hebrew literature with a refer- ence to a country which never was a center for Hebrew creativity? The open- ing gambit is obviously deliberate: it aims to reject traditional tracing of "influences" in order to pose new questions. The early eighteenth century in England should be of particular interest to students of Hebrew literature since it borrowed and further developed the Ancients vs. Moderns controversy from the French seventeenth-century critics and also witnessed many of the early phenomena we usually associate with modernism: secularization, enlightenment, industrialization, urbaniza- tion, the increase of literacy, democratization. The English experience was replicated on the continent, particularly in Germany. As Lawrence Marsden Price has demonstrated so convincingly in his English Literature in Ger- many, most of which deals with the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, one cannot form a coherent picture of German literature in Germany during that period without factoring in the English influence.3 Price, for instance, has fully documented chapters on the moral weeklies, Pope, Thomson, Mil- ton, Young, MacPherson's Ossian, Percy's Reliques, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Goldsmith, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and an entire section on Shake- speare. As one reads through studies of early modern Hebrew literature, particularly of the Berlin maskilim, one is struck by the gross neglect of the English connection. England, furthermore, presents a useful paradigm for modernization because of its priority in many areas, its relatively unbroken line of development, and the widespread commercial and cultural influence of England until World War I. Much of the recent literary criticism written in France, England, and America has been obsessed with the problematics of modernity, often attri- buted to the subversion of the scriptural underpinnings of language since the eighteenth century, which has led to such notions as the indeterminacy of language, the crisis of consciousness, the abyss gaping between conscious- ness and reality, and the reinterpretation of Nietzsche and Freud-in short, the entire deconstructive enterprise. Since so much of the criticism of culture traces its roots back to the eighteenth century, it behooves us to examine the Hebrew writers of the period in this light even if we discover that the crisis of consciousness cannot be found there. 3. L. M. Price, English Literature in Germany (Berkeley, 1953).</page><page sequence="4">4 ARNOLD J.BAND In the past twenty-five years, there has been little theoretical debate con- cerning either the beginnings of modern Hebrew literature, its secularity, or its consequent problematics. The energies of research in modern Hebrew literature have been invested elsewhere, in formalist, semiological, or nar- ratological studies. The eighteenth century, in fact, has attracted relatively little attention. With the exception of pioneering work being conducted in the aesthetic analysis of the Hasidic tale (composed at the end of the eigh- teenth century, but published at the beginning of the nineteenth), the few articles devoted to eighteenth-century writers have essentially illuminated some dark corners in the work of the Berlin maskilim. The avoidance of theorizing about the beginnings and nature of modern Hebrew literature is concomitant with a recrudescence of interest in the problematics of modern- ism and literary history in Western Europe, England, and America, for this is the period of Foucault and Derrida in France, of Jauss in Germany, Bloom and Hartman in America, let alone Marxists of all stripes throughout the Western world. While I do not argue that all or any of these theoreti- cians should be applicable to our own field of study, I do find it curious that precisely when modernity becomes a burning issue in the more advanced Western literary societies, it is not an issue which exercises contemporary Hebrew literary criticism. Bate, to be sure, is no deconstructionist, but even in his more traditional mode of criticism he points to an aspect of the anxiety of the eighteenth- century English poet. Contrasting him with Harold Bloom, one of the more influential American critics of crisis, is particularly illuminating, since Bloom tries to understand and perhaps bridge this abyss with ideas taken from Buber and Scholem. Bate's argument, put simply, is that the modern poet in general, and the eighteenth-century poet in particular, had to strug- gle with the poetic tradition of his forebears in order to create his own modes of expression. This struggle was beset with a psychological anxiety first alluded to by David Hume, but expanded upon in recent years by Bloom.4 This anxiety engendered a pervasive self-consciousness which, Bate asserts, is one of the hallmarks of the literature to which we attribute the nebulous term "modern." Note that Bate's passage subtly suggests the themes which inform the self-consciousness of the poets and critics of the 4. The books by Bloom pertinent to this argument are The Anxiety ofl Influence (New York, 1973), A Map of Misreading (New York, 1975), Kabbalah and Criticism (New York, 1975), Poetry and Repression (New Haven, 1976), and Agon (New York, 1982).</page><page sequence="5">BEGINNINGS OF MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE 5 period: "not so high"; "less of a unit"; "barer"; "an empty shrine." Bate, furthermore, never forgets that the history of literature is the account of the struggles of a succession of creative writers to express themselves in their own idiom despite the burden of past writers which is part of the linguistic and literary tradition which enables them to express themselves.5 He, nevertheless, regards the transition from period to period as evolutionary, that through such new notions as sublimity and the imagination, romantic poets learned to bear the burden of the past and the problematics of moder- nity generated by it. Bloom's position is a "revision" of the traditional one advanced by Bates in that where Bates sees evolution, Bloom sees cataclytic, but creative, dis- junction. Bloom's version of this anxiety is, as is well known, formulated in Freudian terms: the struggle of the poet against his immediate ancestors is Oedipal and violent. Whatever we might think of Bloom's exotic ratios, or his often rash excursions into gnosticism and Kabbalah to seek metaphors for his theories, one must grant that he has revitalized the study of literary influence in the past decade. Since the periods discussed by both Bate and Bloom are what has commonly been recognized as the threshold of moder- nity-the eighteenth century-a testing of the applicability of their theories to Hebrew literature of that century to which we commonly attribute the beginnings of modern Hebrew literature should be a fruitful heuristic exer- cise. It should, furthermore, provoke a sorely needed rethinking of the basic critical assumptions we utilize in approaching the materials of the period and make us conscious of the "tropics of our discourse," to use the term of Hayden White. It is illuminating, for instance, to cite at least one sharp contrast between the problematics occupying Bate and Bloom and that facing the scholar of eighteenth-century Hebrew literature. When one speaks of the burden of the past suffered by the eighteenth-century English poets, one refers to the immediate past, to Milton and, a bit more removed, to Shakespeare. To escape parental authority, they espoused ancestral authority in the form of classical antiquity with canons of aesthetics often borrowed from the French, who had experienced somewhat similar problems. Bate (p. 22) argues that "this is the first large scale example, in the modern history of the arts, of the" leapfrog use of the past for authority or psychological comfort: 5. See Hayden N. White's remarks on this subject in the article cited in note 1.</page><page sequence="6">6 ARNOLD J.BAND the leap over the parental-the principal immediate predecessors-to what Northrop Frye calls "the modal grandfather." It should be immediately clear that none of the Hebrew writers we shall discuss, Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, N.H. Wessely, and the early Hasidic storytellers, suffered from this "burden of the past," since they were not preceded by towering literary talents which they had to overcome. To the extent that there was a burden to overcome, it was the burden of the present, more specifically, the repressive force of traditional rabbinical authorities. If we were to utilize the parental/ancestral terms proffered by Frye and Bate, we would have to designate the parental as the normative Judaism of the period of the author and the ancestral as an idealized biblical ethos, different in each case, upon which the author could draw to legitimize his activities in the face of the recognized, established authorities. While Luzzatto's and Wessely's long poems openly employ biblical diction and character-types, the Hasidic tales almost always have as prooftext or subtext some biblical image or reference. In each of the three cases we shall study, the composition of an aesthetically pleasing drama, or poem, or story-whatever the overt religious or social message may be-is an imminent goal. The formal quali- ties of the text are those of accomplished literary artifacts. We must remember, furthermore, that the notion of "beauty" in all its manifestations is problematic in itself. While the admiration for "the beauti- ful" in life and literature was one of the basic Haskalah tenets, it is difficult to know when the preoccupation with aesthetics is inextricably bound up with the whole complex of Haskalah notions and impulses and when it is an independent value.6 When a poet or a critic expresses his admiration for a certain work, e.g., Wessely's Shirei Tiferet, and extolls its "beautiful poetry, the likes of which we have not seen since the Bible," what, we must ask, does he really mean? Aesthetic notions rarely exist in isolation from other ideolo- gical considerations. 6. See Y.

D. Luzzatto and Meir Halevi Let- teris, the now classical positions were fully formulated, as is well known, almost a century later by Y. F. Lachower (1928)9 and J. Klausner (1930).Io In each of these two cases we find a conceptual need to attribute the begin- ning of the modern period to an individual, either M. H. Luzzatto (by Lachower) or N. H. Wessely (Klausner). In neither instance does a specific word for "modern" appear; the term throughout all theoretical discussions in Hebrew of modern Hebrew literature is h.adashah, simply "new" as opposed to "old" (cf. Lachower's book of essays; 'Al gevul hayashan vehe- h.adash), suggesting that on the theoretical level, at least, there was little awareness of the problematics of modernity much discussed in other litera- tures and forcefully injected into the discourse on the topic by Baruch Kurz- weil as late as the 1950s." When it comes to reasons and definitions, Lachower is irritatingly elu- sive. He refers to a "new spirit," a "new style" and "content," immense liter- ary talent; but while he finds in Luzzatto's Migdal Oz clear echoes of the secular environment, he also finds in it unavoidable references to kabbalistic sources, particularly in the image of the tower-and yet seems to feel no 7. The histories of literature (and several high school textbooks) have been treated in detail by Avraham Holz in "Prolegomenon to a Literary History of Modern Hebrew Literature," Literature East and West 11, no. 3 (1967): 253-270.

Kurzweil's many essays of the 1950s on this subject were first collected in Sifrutenu hahadashah: hemshekh o mahpekhah [Our Modern Literature: Continuation or Revolt?] (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1959).</page><page sequence="8">8 ARNOLD J.BAND need to reconcile the two strains. His claims of subsequent historical influences are sparse and undocumented. Klausner's argument is more cohesive: he chooses Wessely as the key proponent of the new period, since his pamphlet Divre shalom ve'emet (1782) was a forthright statement espousing secular education and enlightenment, the ideals of the group known as the Me'asfim, which generated such con- troversy at the end of the century.'2 He rejects Lachower's arguments for Luzzatto's primacy on three grounds: Luzzatto was essentially a religious author, a kabbalist even in his dramas; his plays were not known until a century after their composition; Luzzatto had never intended to begin a new age. The last reason is naive at best, since it assumes that the individual writer to whom one can attribute a new departure has deliberately and con- sciously set upon a new path-a position which few historians would accept. Wessely, furthermore, did advocate educational reform, but had no dreams of being the father of a new epoch in Hebrew literature. On the matter of his- torical filiation, Klausner is on somewhat firmer ground: only some fifty copies of Luzzatto's Layesharim Tehilla were published in 1743, while Mig- dal Oz was not published until 1837 and Maase Shimshon was not published until 1927. By the time Migdal Oz was finally published, the reputation of Wessely as the prime literary influence on such figures as Shalom HaCohen, Meir Letteris, and Adam HaCohen was firmly established. What Klausner neglects to mention (and I shall treat at length) is the great popularity of Layesharim Tehilla between 1780 and 1836. Klausner's categorical identification of the new, i.e., modern literature as secular was by no means new, but was decisive because of his reputation. Once secularism, however, ill-defined, was posited as the dominant charac- teristic of this new literature, the unanswered-perhaps unasked-question remaining was: What was this secularism? The more important question: What value does one assign to it? had been taken as a given, even though what would seem to be the prior question, the definition, had not yet been adequately clarified. Clearly both Lachower and Klausner considered this modernity a positive achievement. For Klausner, a militant Zionist, it was associated with worldly activism, which led through the Haskalah to the Jewish Renaissance and political Zionism, which he advocated. Lachower, no less a nationalist than Klausner, was more attuned to the vitality mani- 12.

His essays should be read in conjunction with Bialik's two essays: "Ha- Bahur MiPadova" ("The Youth from Padua" [on Luzzatto]) and "Giluy vekhisuy balashon" ("The Revealed and the Hidden in Language").'3 Bialik's editorial work on Sefer HaAggadah or the medieval Hebrew poets was later paralleled by Lachower's work with Y. Tishby on the Zohar.'4 In all these cases one finds a relentless preoccupation with language: How does one create in language? How does one write in Hebrew? What is figural language? How does one edit a legend to make it more attractive in literary terms? The Zohar, finally, self-consciously creates worlds of thought and emotion through language. The clarification of the term "secular" (hiloni) is one of the tasks of H. N. Shapira's lengthy introduction to his Toldot HaSifrut ha'ivrit hahadashah (1940).'~5 Since he finds a mixture of kodesh ("holiness") and h.ol ("secular- ism") throughout Jewish history, he prefers a different set of concepts: "terrestrialism" (the concrete reality of the terrestrial world) vs. "empyreal- ism" (Heb. superliut) (the etherealized reality of the spiritual world). These two terms are paralleled to "introcentrism" vs. "transcentrism." In the course of history, Jewish life has affirmed the preponderance of"terrealism" over "empyrealism"; modern Hebrew literature, in striving as an expression of the collective Jewish will to restore the preponderance of "terrealism," is thus an organic link in the unbroken chain of Jewish culture, a move in the dialectic between these antithetical forces. This latest dialectical swing, the beginning of modernism, began-for Shapira-after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, when Jewish life had reached the extreme of land- less spirituality and began to shift back to concerns for territorial, or terreal, realities. Following the suggestions of Gershom Scholem, Shapira regarded the Sabbatean movement as an abortive step in this direction which ulti- mately led to the Haskalah, in turn, a necessary move towards Zionist nationalism. Literature, of course, is a manifestation of this cosmic dialectic, not an isolated phenomenon to be regarded on aesthetic grounds alone. Shapira's elaborate exposition and coinage of bizarre terms evidence his 13. In Kol kitve H. N. Bialik (Tel Aviv, 1951).

He also is not exercised by the psychologi- cal or spiritual implications of modernity, so defined. He is essentially in accord with Klausner's assignment of eighteenth-century secularism of modernism to the 1780s in Berlin, and not with Lachower's choice of Luz- zatto, though many of his reasons are those which led Lachower to select Luzzatto as the beginning of the modern era: a greater power of expressivity, an expansion of the human imagination, etc. The expansion of human capacities and horizons is also the criterion identified by Simon Halkin as the mark of modernity in modern Hebrew literature.'6 Though much less specific than Shapira, Halkin does assert that modern Hebrew literature is essentially the product of the past two centuries and also finds in the Sabbatean movement, as Scholem portrayed it, the desire for a "fuller life in the heart of the simple Jewish folk." While differ- ing from Shapira regarding the terminus a quo, Halkin agrees with his basic criteria. Halkin thus includes Luzzatto in his concept of modern Hebrew literature and also the Hasidic folktale. Both Shapira and Halkin are obviously eager to demonstrate that modern Hebrew literature was a natur- al growth of literary or cultural phenomena which preceded it. They try to demonstrate the fallacy of the prevailing view that this modern literature represented a sudden, unanticipated jump from the medieval to the modern without the mediating period of gradual development in the Renaissance. During the centuries of the Renaissance in Italy, France, and England, most of world Jewry was not affected by the new humanism. Both Halkin and Shapira endeavor to fill this gap by reference to kabbalism, hence their espousal of Scholem's ideas, which Shapira cites as early as 1939-as does Lachower. Avoidance of the potentially critical issues posed by modernity and secularism seems to be the goal of Dov Sadan's holism,'7 which is actually 16. Halkin's position is found in his Modern Hebrew Literature, Trends and Values (New York, 1950), chaps. 1-4; Mavo lasiporet ha'ivrit, notes taken at Halkin's lectures by Tzophia Hillel (Jerusalem, 1954); and in a much-neglected essay, "History and Historicism in Modern Hebrew Literature" (Hebrew), in his collection of essays Derakhim utzedade derakhim basifrut, vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 155-182. The last essay, written after Kurzweil's savage attacks on Halkin, demonstrates that these attacks had little effect on Halkin's initial position. 17.

(Since Zinberg was a Marxist, it is possible that notions of"totalizing" informed his writing on Jewish literature.) Rather than focusing upon the narrow confines of the Hebrew Haskalah as delimited by either Klausner or Lachower, Sadan presents a concept of modern Hebrew literature which embraces the totality of literary creativity in Hebrew over the past three centuries, including tradi- tional rabbinic and Hasidic literature. This holism, in fact, impells him to include in the field of his study everything of Jewish content or concern written by Jews not only in Hebrew, but also in Yiddish, Ladino, and any other language, even if not specifically Jewish, such as German or French or English. While Sadan grants that secularism is the distinguishing feature of Haskalah literature, he regards it as a minor, surface phenomenon under which the subconscious currents of Jewish creativity continue to course. Sadan's thesis has had far-reaching ideological and curricular effects since its formulation in 1950, but it contributes little to a clarification of the ques- tion of modernity. It should be clear that all the above-mentioned positions are Ahad HaAmic rather than Berdiczewskian in their view of the structure of Jewish history. In all cases, Jewish history, for all its variety, was to be considered as a unitarian flow through time, always preserving its essential identity and source of energy, the will to survive of the Jewish people as a distinct cul- tural entity. Where Ahad HaAm saw essentially superficial changes, Ber- diczewski detected radical disjunction and the concomitant relentless strug- gle by the forces of privilege and power to repress all dissent or change. The well-known provenance of their respective positions bears mentioning at this point in our argument. Ahad HaAm derived his evolutionary perspec- tive from Spencer and other British social philosophers of the nineteenth century; Berdiczewski, admittedly Nietzschean, also read deeply in Schopenhauer and Faust. The comparison with Bate's evolutionary deve- lopment and Bloom's cataclytic struggles is illuminating. From Lachower's history (1928) through Halkin's and Sadan's books 18. Israel Zinberg's History of Jewish Literature has a complicated publication history. Its first volumes were published in Russian in the 1920s, but the entire work, including the in- complete last volume, was issued in Yiddish beginning in the late 1920s in Vilna and ending in 1943 in New York. The six-volume Hebrew edition appeared between 1955 and 1960 in Tel Aviv. A twelve-volume English edition was translated and edited by Bernard Martin (Cincin- nati and New York, 1972-78). Zinberg, incidentally, includes Luzzatto among the medieval Hebrew poets.</page><page sequence="12">12 ARNOLD J. BAND (1950) the secularity of modern Hebrew literature, however defined, was not seen as a disjunctive force or problematic from a cultural point of view. The problematics of this secularism, this modernity, was forcefully thrust into the public debate on the nature of modern Hebrew literature, affecting both the interpretive and evaluative processes, in the 1950s by Baruch Kurzweil in a dazzling flurry of splenetic articles including attacks on Halkin, Shapira, Ahad HaAm, Scholem, and most native Israeli writing. Kurzweil derived his ideas from Max Wiener's Juedische Religion in Zeitalter der Emanzipationlg9 and Isaac Breuer's Judenproblem.20 From the former he learned the psychological or spiritual problematics of secularism; from the latter, the critique of secular Zionism seen from a traditional religious point of view. In a variety of different formulations, Kurzweil argued that modern Jewish secularism, the ethos which informed most of modern Hebrew litera- ture, was a radical break from traditional Judaism and therefore an ethos which had been emptied of the fundamental certainty in the sacred which embraces all the phenomena of life and measures their value. Unlike all his predecessors mentioned above, Kurzweil considers this modernity a disaster, a radical discontinuity with the Jewish past, a specious attempt to claim its legitimacy as the rightful heir of historical Judaism while it is actually its repudiation. His answer to the loaded question posed by the title of his most influen- tial book, Our Modern Literature-Continuity or Revolt?, is obvious, and the literature, in his opinion, is an accurate reflection of the calamitous results of this revolt: not the renewal of the Jewish spirit, but its fragmentation and desolation. This fragmentation of the Jewish consciousness was far more catastrophic than the similar fragmentation which appeared in European literature in the eighteenth century, since the European nations had a whole range of social institutions and traditions grounded in landed states of one sort or another from which a viable literature could be sustained even when traditional faith in an all-embracing divinity was undermined. The Jew had nothing but his faith, his halachically structured way of life, and when the sacral underpinnings of that were sapped, there was left a void which could not be filled even with the reestablishment of Jewish political sovereignty in the State of Israel. Steeped in the phenomenological philosophy of his student years, Kurz- 19. Berlin, 1933. 20. Frankfurt-am-Main, 1922.</page><page sequence="13">BEGINNINGS OF MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE 13 weil holds that language flows from being and therefore insists that Hebrew, whose essence is sacral, used by secular authors can only produce a disjoint- ed, shallow literature, the literature of the Haskalah, for instance. Only when authors begin to sense the inadequacy of their secularism as a replace- ment for traditional belief, only when the problematic is intuited-as in the case of Feierberg, or Bialik, or Brenner, or Agnon-does Hebrew literature achieve an aesthetic, though tragic, quality. Kurzweil therefore devoted his literary studies to an examination of the "tragic paradox" which informs the works of some of the foremost modern Hebrew writers. The paradox is the product of their belated realization that their secularism was inadequate to sustain a spiritual way of life. Ruthlessly consistent, he could find little of value in Israeli literature (with the exception of some of Amichai and Ravi- kovich), and of all modern Hebrew writers, only Uri Zvi Greenberg, with his mystic view of Jewish destiny, elicited his unstinting approval. Kurzweil has thus presented a theory of Hebrew modernism which is totalist and revisionist. It is totalist in that it comprehends all of modern Jewish life, hence modern Hebrew literature as the most accurate reflection of modern Jewish life, and allows for no phenomena which might not fit into his theory. As a hermeneutic philosophy, it determines the interpretation of every literary text, and though Kurzweil claims he reads with the authority of Dilthey, Heidegger, or Gadamer, it should be clear to any sensitive reader that he is not engaging in an open dialogue with the text, but searching in it for those passages which might corroborate his views of the catastrophic nature of modernism. It is revisionist in that it completely rejects the norma- tive Zionist overview of Hebrew literature, which posits a dynamic that moves ever upward from traditionally informed texts, to maskilic works, to revival (tehiyah) creativity, culminating in the literature of the State of Israel. Kurzweil's periodization is significantly different from the normative: simplistic Haskalah; militant-reformist Haskalah; the tragic period (which corresponds to the Zionist tehiyah), and the period of the apocalyptic vision of redemption, which actually includes only one writer, Uri Zvi Greenberg. As for eighteenth-century Hebrew literature, Kurzweil has little to offer that is new or even evidences close familiarity with the material. He follows others in regarding the Berlin Haskalah as the point of departure and relies upon Natan Rotenstreich's formulation of the period as radical change in Jewish consciousness.21 Thotigh Rotenstreich was primarily concerned with 21.

In general, one realizes that for all his assertions about the validity of his "inherent reading" of the text, Kurzweil is no less an ideologue than Klausner; neither exhibits much concern with the very nature of the literary text, its literariness, its basic figurality. Since relatively little attention has been devoted for some time to these problems of beginnings-which are ultimately problems of self- definition-new departures are called for. The following paragraphs, there- fore, comprise the beginning of an exploration of the three most influential works of the period in an attempt, not to solve problems, but to put them in such a way as to reopen the discussion, which has been neglected, perhaps deflected, for too long. III We have seen that in refuting Lachower's attribution of the beginning of modern Hebrew literature to Luzzatto, Klausner cited both the belated pub- lication, hence influence, of Migdal Oz, and Luzzatto's kabbalistic, hence anti-secular (i.e., anti-modern) bent. Klausner's citation of the belated pub- lication of Migdal Oz offers a convenient point of departure for a theoretical excursion into several important aspects of literary history which are usually neglected. (Among these I find most useful the notion of Rezeptions- geschichte introduced by Hans Robert Jauss.) While Klausner correctly established the fact that Migdal Oz was available only in manuscript, hence unknown in the formative decades of the Haskalah period, 1780-1830, he strangely neglected to record that Luzzatto's third play, Layesharim Tehilla, though published in only fifty copies in 1743, was republished in Berlin in 1780 and 1799, precisely at the peak of the Berlin Haskalah; in Lemberg, the publishing center of the subsequent Galician Haskalah, in 1799, 1813, 1823, 1825; in Lissa in 1824; Yosefow in 1826; and Bamberg in 1827.22 By the time summary of Kurzweil's career and ideological stance, see James S. Diamond, Barukh Kurzweil and Modern Hebrew Literature (Scholars Press, California, 1983). 22. The popularity of the book might reflect a readership beyond maskilic circles. Luzzatto was admired among pious Jews for his ethical tract, Mesillat Yesharim. Layesharim tehilla</page><page sequence="15">BEGINNINGS OF MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE 15 Migdal Oz was rediscovered (Almanzi bought it from the heirs of R. Elhanan HaCohen, a disciple of R. Israel Benjamin Bassan for whose wed- ding Luzzatto wrote the drama), Layesharim Tehilla was well known in both Berlin and Galicia, as was Luzzatto's famous ethical tract, Mesillat Ye- sharim, which had been published in ten different editions between 1740 (Amsterdam) and 1835 (Yosefow). From the 1780s through the middle of the nineteenth century, the two belletristic books that every maskilic writer had were Wessely's Shirei Tiferet (1789-1811) and Luzzatto's Mesillat Yesharim. Simply from the point of view of factual Rezeptionsgeschichte, the Lachower-Klausner argu- ment has been a futile exercise, since both writers, Luzzatto and Wessely, exerted a powerful influence simultaneously on Hebrew writers and readers during the formative decades: 1790-1830. The historical record was unfor- tunately blurred by Franz Delitzsche's influential statements, which both reflected the prevalent opinion of the 1830s and gave it authority for follow- ing generations: "Mose Chajim ben-Jakob Luzzatto ist der Begruender der moderner Schule in Italien" (p. 89), and "Der Begruender der neuen ger- manischen Schule ist Naftali Wessely" (p. 95). What Delitzsche and his col- leagues might not have realized, since they were themselves receptors-as members of the first generation with a realization that they were experienc- ing a new phrase in the history of Hebrew literature-was that it was precise- ly their perceptions which determined what was modern. It is at this point that Hans Robert Jauss has much to contribute to our argument.23 Rezeptionsgeschichte is, for him, more than a history of the reception of a work of art by certain audiences; it is an ambitious attempt to rejuvenate literary history, which has been anesthetized by the formalists, on the one hand, and the Marxists, on the other. In the process, Jauss also rejects the standard philological approach. He quotes Walther Bulst's state- ment that "no text was ever written to be read and interpreted philologically by philologists," and adds "nor. . .historically by historians. Neither approach recognizes the true role of the reader to whom the literary work is would not offend a pious reader, since it demonstrates the victory of the just (the yesharim; note that the term appears in the title of both books) over the evil and all the "characters" bear the names of virtues or vices. 23.

BAND primarily addressed, a role as unalterable for aesthetic as for historical appreciation" (pp. 7-8). The history of literature, claims Jauss, "is a process of aesthetic recep- tion and production which takes place in realization of literary texts on the part of the receptive reader, the reflective critic, and the author in his con- tinued creativity" (p. 10). To dispel the doubts often voiced that an analysis of the aesthetic impact can approach the meaning of a work of art or serve as the basis for an objective history, Jauss introduces the notion of the horizon of expectations, by which he means the set of expectations with which the reader approaches the text, expectations which are historically contextua- lized since they are based on the reader's reading experience, his notion of genre, his sense of the implicit relationships to familiar works of the literary- historical context, and by the contrast between the poetical and practical functions of language which the reflective reader can always realize while he is reading. (Note the similarities with Bate and Bloom.) As to our ability to gauge the newness of a specific work for a specific audience, Jauss says: If the horizon of expectations of a work is reconstructed in this way, it is pos- sible to determine its artistic nature by the nature and degree of its effect on a given audience. If the "aesthetic distance" is considered as the distance between the given horizon of expectations and the appearance of a new work, whose reception results in a "horizon change" because it negates familiar experience or articulates an experience for the first time, this aesthetic distance can be measured historically in the spectrum of the reaction of the audience and the judgment of criticism (spontaneous success, rejection or shock, scat- tered approval, gradual or later understanding). (p. 14). Turning to Luzzatto and Wessely, it should be clear, in the light of Jauss's theory, that the combined reception of Layesharim Tehilla and Shirei Tiferet between the late 1780s and the middle of the nineteenth century is a central phenomenon in the history of modern Hebrew literature. These two books inspired a host of plays, translations, epic poems, even Avraham Mapu's Ahavat Tzion (1853), the first Hebrew novel. We can detect traces of these books in works by Franco-Mendes, Shalom HaCohen, Meir HaLevy Letteris, Adam HaCohen, Micah Yosef Levinson, and Y. L. Gordon, let alone dozens of less accomplished writers. No less important is the testimony about these books by many of these writers who were also critics and scholars. Nowhere does one find approval</page><page sequence="17">BEGINNINGS OF MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE 17 of these two books because they are secular (Klausner's argument); when they are admired for their praise of wisdom and derision of folly, these are not cited as their cardinal virtues.24 The readers, after all, could and did read "enlightened" books in German or French. The recurring note of admira- tion, even adulation-however awkwardly articulated-is reserved for the sheer beauty of the poetry, its expressiveness, its openness to experience, which is always compared with the poetry of the Hebrew Scriptures. Time and again one encounters the phrase: "Poetry like this has not been written since the time of the Scriptures." The comparison with Scriptures has two effects: it legitimizes the new work and aestheticizes Scriptures. The fact that Wessely and Luzzatto were pious Jews, that the former was attacked for his "new" though really moderate ideas on education, or that the latter was hounded out of Italy for his messianic intimations, seems to have meant little to the readers of their poetic works. For these readers and aspiring poets, schooled primarily on rabbinic texts and those portions of the Bible used in one form or another of religious worship, books like La- yesharim Tehilla or Shirei Tiferet represented a major "change of horizon," for while they were written in a Biblicizing idiom, hence accessible and familiar, they offered a narrative sweep (Wessely), an enchanting portrayal of nature, of passion, and sensuous figural language (Luzzatto). Each, in fact, offered a different mode of poetic expression: Shirei Tiferet became the paradigm in modern Hebrew literature for the lengthy narrative poem, the poema; La Yesharim Tehilla (and, after 1836, Migdal Oz), which was poor in plot but rich in figural language and lyrical passages, demonstrated for several generations of poets-and novelists-the potentialities of complex lyrical expression in a language which none of them spoke. The most eloquent testimony to the impact of Luzzatto's achievement in expanding the linguistic horizons of Hebrew poetry is found a century later in Bialik's famous essay "HaBahlur MiPadova,"25 written upon the publica- tion of Luzzatto's book of plays by Simon Ginzburg in 1927.26 Bialik, to be sure, was no historian or trained philologist. His enthusiastic, lavish praise is historically distorted: he attributes the entire upsurge of modern Jewish 24. On Wessely, see Klausner, op. cit., pp. 138-143.

BAND creativity to Luzzatto, the inspiration, he implies, for the three fountain- heads of modern Judaism: Elijah, the Gaon of Vilna, the Baal Shem Tov, and Moses Mendelssohn. Bialik is on much sounder ground when he focuses upon Luzzatto's poetic contribution, the purification and healing of a defiled and sick language, the concrete expression of the soul of the people. Deliberately following Luzzatto, Bialik indulges in bold imagery. Luzzatto is always compared to the light of redemption; just as his disciples saw in him a redeemer and messiah, so Bialik, referring to Hebrew literature, does not hesitate to name Luzzatto "The Redeemer" and "The Messiah"; it was through Luzzatto's genius (always described in popular kabbalistic terms) that the morning light of Hebrew literature burst forth to "a new life, and most importantly, a life different from that which preceded it."27 The modernity of modern Hebrew literature, for Bialik, begins with the explo- sive literary creativity of Luzzatto, an explosion repeatedly portrayed in kabbalistic metaphors connected with the purifying light of redemption. (It would be interesting to compare Harold Bloom's recourse to kabbalistic metaphors with that of Bialik.) No less crucial is Bialik's formulation of the manifold aspects of Luz- zatto's personality and creativity, a problem which troubles most critics, even so perceptive a scholar as J. Schirmann, whose essay on Luzzatto's plays is still the point of departure for all studies of this material.28 Both at the beginning and the end of his essay, Schirmann wonders about the con- trast between the "enlightened" poet who writes pastorals in the Italian style and the mystic who heard voices and claimed he was the messiah. (The naivet6 of this query is puzzling and exhibits a resistance to a common phe- nomenon in religion. Luzzatto's combination of mysticism and dramaturgy is no more paradoxical than Joseph Karo's mysticism and rational jurism, as demonstrated by R. J. Z. Werblowsky.)29 In several well-crafted, almost lyrical passages Bialik claims that this confluence of seething, seemingly contradictory streams gathered in the pool (berekha, the same metaphor for the introspective soul in Bialik's poema "HaBerekha") "which God pre- pared for their repose in the soul of his chosen one, Luzzatto.

When one approaches the literary text on its own terms and formulates the initial questions in accor- dance with the peculiar nature of literary language, the line of investigation leads us to different perspectives regarding the meaning of the text or its modernity. If, for instance, scholars studying Luzzatto's plays, all of which have a pastoral element, had spent as much time delving into the assump- tions of the genre as in mechanical line-by-line comparisons of Luzzatto with Guarini, they would have asked more interesting questions.32 For instance, the psychological impulse which generates the pastoral poem is the sense that the world is too much with us, that we must find an escape from the overwhelming present to a past Golden Age of simple innocence and happiness or forward to an equally tranquil, carefree utopia. From the Hel- lenistic period on, pastorals are written by urban dwellers about an imagin- ary landscape free of urban concerns. As P. V. Marinelli puts it succinctly: The land of Arcadia is really the landscape of an idea. ... Arcadia is primarily the paradise of poetry. It is a middle country of the imagination, half-way between a past perfection and present imperfection, a place of Becoming 30. P. 229. 31.

Though Yonah David (op. cit.) does discuss the pastoral or allegorical features of the plays, he draws no substantial conclusions.

BAND rather than Being, where an individual's potencies for the arts of life and love and poetry are explored and tested. It points two ways, therefore, backward into the past and forward into a possible future.33 Speculative and practical mysticism, we are told, does not arise in a void, but rather within the circles of institutionalized religions which the mystic feels no longer satisfy his deepest religious needs. One then creates a Zohar, figuratively speaking, a work of literary speculation about the inner work- ings of the cosmos or the soul or the Godhead. The literary form may be entirely different-homiletic rather than pastoral drama-but the psycho- logical similarities are too numerous to dismiss. Both the author and his receptive audience obviously find in this literary, mythic world, an escape from the real world in which they are constrained to pass their daily exis- tence. While Luzzatto patently found it necessary to purge the pastoral of pagan or Christian elements, to Judaize it, his choice of the pastoral as a genre of literary composition implied certain assumptions and conventions which are not contradictory with zoharic modes of thought, but actually complementary to them. The first generation of maskilim also praised Wessely's Shirei Tiferet34 primarily for its poetry and not for its rationalist ideology. One of the poetic aspects admired is the narrative sweep of the biblical tale retold in clear, unencumbered verses, free from convoluted syntax and quantitative metrics. And while this lengthy epic on the life of Moses leading up to the Sinaitic Revelation failed to maintain interest after the 1880s, we should not over- look the innovation it represented to Hebrew readers and writers between the publication of its first volume in 1789 and the end of the subsequent cen- tury. Despite Wessely's enlightenment didacticism and veiled philological pedantry, the poem was the first intentional "epic" treatment in Hebrew of the Exodus and the Revelation at Sinai. For readers intimately acquainted with the biblical original, the epic treatment, in alexandrine sestets, was not only exciting but revolutionary precisely because of its narrative line ener- gized by a sense of the sublimity of subject and hero. Unlike the satirists like Euchel, Berlin, or Wolfsohn,35 Wessely was one 33. Pastoral (London, 1971). 34. Berlin and Prague, 1789-1811.

Despite his intention to create a work that would render the sacred teachings of the Torah more accessible to the reader, he actually produced one of the most "modern," even potentially subversive works of the period: he departed from the traditional norms of exegesis and homily, and rendered the most theologically central moments of the Penta- teuch in a verse form adopted from the German literature of the period. In a sense, this was a literary act far more daring than that of Luzzatto's. Ironi- cally, the dangers of this departure from, hence challenge to, traditional norms of literary expression associated with Scripture were never an issue at the beginning of the nineteenth century. And when Uri Kovner, by no means a defender of the faith, opened his attack on much of Haskalah litera- ture in 1866 by savaging Shirei Tiferet, he faulted Wessely for trying to com- pete with the original biblical text, not because this act was sacrilegious, but because it was aesthetically a failure.36 Shirei Tiferet thus presents us with a Rezeptiongeschichte totally different from that of Luzzatto's dramas. Wes- sely's work found-or created-its audience upon publication, but lost it within two generations. S. D. Luzzatto, for whom anything written in Hebrew was a source of national pride, found it boring; even Klausner, who posits Wessely as the father of modern Hebrew literature, must strain to describe its virtues. The first two important literary works we have discussed, Luzzatto's Layesharim Tehilla and Wessely's Shirei Tiferet, each commonly recognized as a major work in the first generation of what we call modern Hebrew liter- ature, were written by pious Jews. Our third example, Shivhe HaBesht,37 actually a compilation of Hasidic tales edited and published by Dov Ber ben Shmuel in 1815, also took shape in the last decades of the eighteenth century in circles of pious Jews, this time the Hasidim of the Ukraine, who knew nothing of the Italian pastoral or the German epic poem. Our inclusion of Hasidic literature is done with full awareness of the problematics of such inclusion; no history of modern Hebrew literature has, to date, included the Hasidic tale. Zinberg did include the tale (in vol. 9), since he was writing a (1978): 43-55, and Yehudah Friedlander, Perakim basatira ha'ivrit beshilhe hamea'ah ha-18 beGermania (Tel Aviv, 1979). 36.

Since the Hasidic tale was ordinarily first told and transmitted in Yiddish but then transcribed either in Yiddish or Hebrew, Zinberg's Marxist leanings would naturally lead him to include such popular litera- ture. Sadan, as mentioned above, insists on including the Hasidic tale, though he has never written a history, while Kurzweil dismisses Sadan's sug- gestion together with his entire holistic theory. Halkin supports Sadan's contention and finds the concomitance of the emergence of modern Hebrew literature in the west and the Hasidic tale in the east not a coincidence, but an historic inevitability.38 The justification for this inclusion is complex but defensible. Though the tale was not the prime genre of Hasidic expression-the homily was-most students of Hasidism concede that the movement did endow the tale with an importance and dignity it had not received previously. The oft-quoted pre- face to Shivke HaBesht by the printer, Israel Yoffe, corroborates this conten- tion.39 From it we learn that even in the period of Menahem Mendel of Vitebsk's sojourn in Eretz Yisrael (1777-1788), it was already a custom among Hasidim to substitute pious tales for the customary Torah lesson at the third Sabbath meal late on Saturday afternoon; the tale, that is, had already assumed a quasi-ritual function and could be substituted for a Torah lesson. This, of course, is not the aestheticism we find in Western Europe, an integral part of the maskilic ethos with all its ambiguities. The tradition of storytelling became well entrenched in Hasidic circles and con- tinues till today. While it is true that maskilim ridiculed Hasidic tales until the 1880s, the enormous popularity of these tales among Hasidim cannot be overlooked unless we choose to restrict modern Hebrew literature to writers directly associated with the Haskalah. One cannot neglect, furthermore, the satires of Perl and Erter, which parody Hasidic tales, since these satires are among the most significant achievements of early modern Hebrew literature (1819 ff.).40 However negative the portrayal of Hasidism, the Hasidic tale with its 38.

As the Haskalah waned in Russia in the late 1870s and the early 1880s, the partial nationalistic turning inwards led secular Hebrew writers to the abundant corpus of Hasidic tales for materials to collect or recast for their own pur- poses and own audiences. This process has continued for a century and shows no signs of abatement. On the contrary: in the past decade the Hasi- dic tale has become a subject for serious academic study as literature.41 Close analysis of the tales included in the two classical collections, Shivhe HaBesht and Sippure Hama'asiyot of Nahman of Bratslav,43 reveals a sur- prising literary sophistication which raises many unanswerable questions regarding provenance of the tale-telling tradition, the nature of the intended audience, the reception by the actual audience. IV In the light of our discussion of the perspectives on modernity prevalent in the studies of modern Hebrew literature and our examination of the three cardinal cases taken from the eighteenth century, it should be clear that one must constantly approach this problem from several perspectives at once. What is or is not "modern" depends upon the beholder of the phe- nomenon-as the Latin etymology of the word "modern" (modo) denotes: "just now." The etymological sense was very much alive in the seventeenth- century debates in France, Italy, and England of the Ancients vs. the Moderns and implies simply "what we believe in, or delight in, now." During the course of these debates, the term became reified, and the original implication lurking beneath the surface, i.e., we, as opposed to the ancients, are bound by no stable truths, was blurred. Specific critics might then iden- tify modern with secularism, or nationalism, or Marxism, etc-all with the kalah. Perl's Megalei Temirin (Vienna, 1819) has elicited some of the best research efforts, since it is one of the most accomplished Hebrew works of the nineteenth century. 41.

One can handle these shifting perspectives only by maintaining the clear distinction between what E. D. Hirsch calls interpretation, i.e., the investigation of textual meaning, vs. criticism, i.e., the relevance to the reader of a specific period.43 "Meaning" in this sense is parallel to Husserl's "inner horizon"; "re- levance," to his "outer horizon." Jauss, as we have seen, builds on Husserl and Ingarden to provide us with the conceptual tools for a sound literary history. The notion of secularism is no less troublesome. While it derives from "of this world" as opposed to the world of faith (originally: of the Church), its Hebrew equivalent, hol, is by no means as distinct, since traditionally the hol was embraced by a world whose coordinates were categorically kodesh. Though oblivious to historical research, Kurzweil's distinction between tra- ditional hulin and modern hulin was valuable. A more precise and fruitful formulation can be found in Luzzatto's contemporary and countryman Giambattista Vico, whose Scienza Nuova was unappreciated for at least a century after its initial publication in 1725.44 Vico's concept of the New Science, the science of human society, involved a universe of discourse in which what man recognizes as true (verum) and what he himself has made (factum) are identical. In short, the "physics of man" reveals that men have created themselves-and their concept of God in their myths. Not only does man create societies and institutions in his own image, but these, in turn, create him. In this process, language, myth, metaphor play a dominant role, since they are the tools by which man shapes the world in his imagination, and which, in turn, shape his perception of the world. The realization that this is fundamentally a world without God, that God has been a creation of the human imagination, that the ultimate reality is language, is what informs much of the discussion of modernity during the past generation. Bate and Bloom, for instance, refer to this realization and its psychological consequences, as do many other theoreticians of repute. It is therefore crucial that we examine our eighteenth-century texts for signs of this anxiety of modernity. Kurzweil's claim that the last two decades of the eighteenth century are marked by a radical change in the nature of Hebrew literature would be dif- 44. La Scienza Nuova (Naples, 1725, 1730, 1744).

Indeed, if one were to seek undeniable proof of radical secularization, one would have to advance about a century to the 1890s, where the seculariza- tion one thinks of in European literature bursts forth in full bloom. One, of course, could find instances in 1860s, but the attack upon traditional institu- tions and moeurs which one finds in such abundance in the 1860s refrains from any open denial of divine providence. This unmistakable mark of secu- larism begins to surface in the 1890s. As for the sense of belatedness which generated anxiety in eighteenth-century English poets, one cannot find it in modern Hebrew literature until the first decade of the twentieth century, when the new, overwhelming standards of literary achievement had been set by Mendele, Bialik, Ahad HaAm, and Tchernichowski. "Modernity" thus is a term applicable to modern Hebrew literature only with the greatest caution. We certainly cannot simply equate it with a vague notion of secularism and go on from there. An analysis of eighteenth- century texts precludes the possibility of this common option. We cannot, furthermore, avoid the difficulties of the problem by facilely attaching the literary problem, which has its own determinants, to general considerations of Haskalah culture (which, incidentally, is fraught with ambiguities) and therefore claim that the literature is "modern" rather than "medieval"- whatever that means. We must ask what works display signs of modernity which we can agree upon. (Perhaps, for instance, Shirei Tiferet is the most "modern" eighteenth-century literary work precisely for the reasons sug- gested above.) We must ask what were the notions of modernity maintained by the audience of the work in the specific period under study: the 1780s or the 1830s or the 1860s or the 1890s or the 1980s. Perspectives change rapid- ly, since the very term "modernity" implies unstable norms of perception. We must concede, furthermore, that anyone engaged in the academic study of Judaism is, as Y. Yerushalmi notes, "a product of the rupture" in history. "Once aware of this, he is not only bound to accept it; he is liberated to use it."45 The acceptance and productive use of the rupture is an act which would elicit assent from such disparate figures as Foucault, Bloom, and- closer to home-M. J. Berdiczewski. It is precisely Berdiczewski who among Hebrew writers was most aware of the ruptures of "modernity" in the sense used today. Though he appeared 45. Y.
