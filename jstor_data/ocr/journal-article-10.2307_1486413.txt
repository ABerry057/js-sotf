This Italian 1. Parts of the Discorso have been translated into Latin, French, German and English. For the English translation, see Commentary 3 (1947):371-77, 474-78, 13 (1952):589-93, and for a listing of the other partial translations, see Benjamin Ravid, Economics and Toleration in Seven- teenth Century Venice: The Background and Context of the Discorso of Simone Luzzatto (Jerusa- lem, 1978), pp. 7-8, note 1. The only complete translation is the Hebrew translation by Dante Lattes (Jerusalem, 1950), with two Hebrew introductions: Moses A. Shulvass, "Rabbi Simha Luzzatto" (reprinted in In The Grip of Centuries [Hebrew] [Tel Aviv-Jerusalem, 1960], pp. 33-55) and Roberto Bachi, "Introduction to the Hebrew edition of the Discorso on the State of the Jews" (partly reprinted in Italian, with additions, in his Israele disperso e ricostruito [Rome, 1952], pp. 97-139). 301</page><page sequence="2">302 BENJAMIN RAVID work, 184 quarto size pages in length, was addressed to the Venetian patri- ciate which constituted the governing body of the city. On the basis of infor- mation contained in a seventeenth-century Hebrew chronicle first published in 1949, it appears that it had been written in order to avert an expulsion which threatened the Jews of Venice in 1636-37.2 The Discorso can be divided easily into two parts. The first, consisting of considerations (considerazioni, as its sections are called) I to 10, constitutes a pioneering approach to the problem of the toleration of the Jews in the preemancipation diaspora.3 Its intention was to justify the residence of the Jews in Venice on the basis of their fiscal and commercial utility, primarily in the sphere of international maritime commerce, but also in that of money- lending. A study of Venetian commerce in the opening decades of the seven- teenth century and of the discussions over the renewal of the ten year charters of the Jewish merchants, the first of which was issued in 1589, clearly establishes that the Discorso is firmly rooted in the realia of its times. Luzzatto strove as a defense attorney to preserve the status quo of the Jews of Venice.4 The second part of the Discorso (considerations 11-18) deals with totally different subject matter and should be viewed and analyzed in the context of Judeo-Christian polemics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and the Jewish-Christian "rapprochement," which induced some prominent Jews (Leone Modena and Menasseh ben Israel, for example) to seek to explain Judaism to the Christian world.' It was Luzzatto's specific intention, after establishing the economic utility of the Jews, to continue to create a more favorable climate of opinion toward them both by refuting the tradi- tional anti-Jewish charges current at that time (especially the allegation that they were hostilely inclined toward all non-Jews), and also, positively, by presenting a very brief and succinct account of their schools of thought and 2.

So far, no evidence, other than a passing remark in the above-mentioned Hebrew chronicle, has yet come to light regarding the role of the Discorso in averting the threatened expulsion of the Jews. Clearly, they were not expelled from Venice in 1637, and indeed dwelled continuously in the city until the end of the Republic in 1797, and on into the nineteenth and twen- tieth centuries.6 As far as the literary history of the Discorso is concerned, it profoundly influenced Menasseh ben Israel and was also utilized by Isaac Cardoso.7 Early in the following century, the English deist John Toland was so impressed with the arguments of the Discorso that he not only extensively summarized parts of the book, but also stated that he intended to translate it into English, a plan which apparently was never implemented.s Significant- ly, the Discorso also sufficiently impressed two contemporary Christian writers, Melchiore Palontrotti and Giulio Morosini, at least one of whom was a convert, to induce them to attack it in writing. A description and analysis of their hitherto neglected critiques is of double significance; it will both draw attention to some perceived weaknesses in the Discorso and also reveal the outlook and mentality of the only two known critics of the volume. II Melchiore Palontrotti was a very prolific seventeenth-century anti- Jewish polemicist who wrote at least ten anti-Jewish works.9 Yet despite 6.

It is not known whether he was born a Christian, or converted from Judaism. Three years after the appearance of the Dis- corso Palontrotti published his Breve risposta a Simone Luzatto [sic] (Brief Response to Simone Luzzatto) (Rome, 1641). This work was included by Imbonatus in his Bibliotheca latino-hebraica," and Imbonatus's reference to the Breve risposta has been cited by later authors, sometimes on the basis of a subsequent source without reference to Imbonatus.12 Since to date no details on either the length or the contents of the Breve risposta have been noted, it can be assumed that this very rare work has hitherto never been consulted.'3 The Breve risposta, a brief thirteen page pamphlet, can best be characterized as a traditional, harsh, polemical, Christian anti-Jewish tract. While for the most part Palontrotti used the Discorso as a point of depar- ture for citing biblical verses with their standard accepted Christian anti- Jewish interpretations, he did make a few valid criticisms of some of the weaker apologetical arguments advanced in the Discorso. In the following presentation, the main emphasis will not be on systematically analyzing Palontrotti's anti-Jewish arguments or ascertaining their sources, but rather, on his response to the Discorso. The Breve risposta constitutes, as its title implies, a direct response to the Discorso of Simone Luzzatto. It is written in the first person, with Luzzatto 10. There is no entry on Palontrotti in either the Jewish Encyclopedia or the Encyclopaedia Judaica, and to date I have been unable to locate any biographical information on him in Italian sources. Imbonatus apparently knew nothing about Palontrotti since he merely charac- terized him as "Vir in Sacra, &amp; Hebraica literatura apprim6 versatus Italic6 scripsit Opera sequentia"; Imbonatus, Bibliotheca, p. 160. 11. Imbonatus reproduced the title of the Breve risposta inaccurately as "Breve risposta da Simone Luzzato [sic] Ebreo in Venetia"; Imbonatus, Bibliotheca, p. 161. 12. See Johann C.

The Breve risposta is also mentioned in Encyclopaedia Judaica (Berlin, 1928-34), s.v. "Luzzatto, Simone"; Shulvass, "Rabbi Simha Luzzatto," p. 23; Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971), s.v. "Luzzatto, Simone," where it is misdated 1642; also the work is alluded to in Roth, Venice, p. 229. 13. I should like to thank the Centro Nazionale per il Catalogo Unico delle Biblioteche Italiane e per le Informazioni Bibliografiche which responded to my query as to where I could obtain a copy of the Breve risposta by referring me to the Bibliotheca Vallicelliana in Rome, and to the Bibliotheca Vallicelliana for sending me, in the spring of 1969, virtually by return mail, a microfilm of the work.</page><page sequence="5">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 305 often addressed either by name "O Luzzatto," or in the "polite" Italian second person plural "voi" form. Its very opening lines are hostile in tone. Palontrotti relates that, induced by the urging of friends rather than by the desire to waste time,14 he has gone quickly through Luzzatto's book and noted some things which led him to believe that the aim of the Discorso was to place a veil over the eyes so that one could not penetrate the craftiness of its author's thoughts. Palontrotti commences his response to the Discorso with Luzzatto's first consideration, in which he claims that Luzzatto had said that "it is better that trade be in the hands of the Jews than of any other nation." Actually, Palontrotti is not accurately reproducing Luzzatto's argument, for Luzzatto had not made such a statement either in the first consideration of the Discorso or elsewhere in the book. Palontrotti appears to be distorting the key argument of Luzzatto presented in the second and third considerations of the Discorso. In the second consideration, Luzzatto's main theme was that since the native Vene- tian merchants had retired from maritime commerce and foreigners were taking it over, it was better that it be in the hands of the Jews than in those of the foreigners.'5 In the third consideration, Luzzatto elaborated further on this view.'6 His arguments were primarily economic, with political and social overtones. It was difficult to attract foreigners to the city; they wanted to possess real estate which was in short supply and then after becoming wealthy, they sought titles of nobility, power and jurisdiction. Finally, they would go home and take their profits out of the city, thereby draining rather than enriching it. On the other hand, the Jews had no homeland to which they aspired to take their profits, could not own real estate, did not seek office, titles of nobility and power and, as long as they were well-treated, would always remain in the city and not remove wealth from it. Therefore, Luz- zatto concluded, since the Venetian citizens had given up trade with the 14.

This argument of Luzzatto had to be met on economic and commercial grounds. In fact, Luzzatto was to a certain extent on the defensive. Although the Venetian government and its Board of Trade were basically favorably inclined toward the Jews from the time of the granting of the first charter to the Jewish merchants in 1589 on, thereby indicating their need for the Jewish merchants and indirectly corroborating the arguments of Luzzatto, on occasion minority reports dissenting from the favorably inclined majority of the Board of Trade assumed a hostile tone, accusing the Jews of taking away the diminishing share of overseas trade still in the hands of the native Venetian merchants." It was no doubt as a reaction to such senti- ments expressed by the Board of Trade and more generally held in certain Venetian circles that Luzzatto formulated his defense of the role of the Jews in the overseas trade of Venice. Palontrotti, however, totally failed to respond to the innovative and original utilitarian apologetics of Luzzatto. He only reacted emotionally on the traditional theological plane of abstract hostility, rather than dealing with the economic and commercial reality. See, he tells Luzzato, if your ideas will stand up to close scrutiny, since St. Paul said that the Jews "killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets ... displease God and oppose all men" (1 Thessalonians 2:15), while previously the prophet foretold: "And they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left" (Zechariah 12:6). How, he asks rhetorically, can one hope for faithful- ness from him who has no faith; who would throw himself into the hands of so fierce an enemy; how can one engage in business with those who are eager to destroy one; how can one consider useful those who deal only fraudulent- ly and deceitfully. Who, Palontrotti concludes, citing a traditional anti- Jewish argument and in no way responding to the specific apologetica of Luzzatto, does not know the harsh precept of the Talmud which commands that one should take the property of a gentile in any way, as long as the gen- 17. See Ravid, Economics and Toleration, pp. 38-49.</page><page sequence="7">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 307 tile is not aware of it, to avoid danger, as is written in chapter four of the first tractate of the first order.'8 Palontrotti then moves on to the fifth consideration of the Discorso. There, Luzzatto, to bolster his argument that it was more advantageous for the Venetians to deal with Jewish merchants than with other foreign mer- chants, had claimed that the Jews were always, under all forms of govern- ment, deferential and obedient. This was important, he believed, because when foreign merchants became embroiled in disputes over restrictions on navigation and the transportation of goods and other similar critical situa- tions, they would complain to their ministers and consuls and thus mere mercantile affairs would often become incidents of state. However, the Jews, living dispersed all over the world, without a protecting head, were always disposed to obey government orders with prompt docility.19 Luzzatto's observations were correct on the descriptive level, but Palon- trotti exposed their underlying reason, driving home brutally the fact that the Jew had no choice. "I say," he writes, "that one should not call reverent deference of the subject that which is the harsh necessity of the slave toward 18. This charge, in a slightly different form, was already made in Judeo-Christian polemics by Nicholas Donin at the disputation over the Talmud in 1240, the first of the major medieval trials of the Talmud. There it was alleged that "it is permissible to deceive a Christian in every way by a ruse or ingenuity without committing a sin. The sages prove by the Talmud that God gave to the Jews all the possessions of the gentiles." This was supported by misinterpreting and falsely generalizing from two talmudic texts (B.T. Bava Qamma 38a and 113a-b). Specifically, it should be pointed out that the Hebrew word nokhri used in the talmudic passages in question did not refer exclusively to Christians, but rather to non-Jews in general (i.e., nokhri from the root nkhr, foreign, includes all non-Jews, while the specific term for Christians would be noyeri, derived from the place name Nazareth). Palontrotti here accurately uses the Italian gentile which I have translated by its English cognate "gentile," but later when allegedly quoting this passage from the Talmud, Palontrotti uses the word Christianorum (see below). On the disputation of 1240, see the article, with texts, published by Isadore Loeb, "La con- troverse de 1240 sur le Talmud," Revue des etudes juives 1 (1880):247-61, 2 (1881):248-70, 3 (1881):39-57, especially 2:265-67, Judah Rosenthal, "The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240," Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s. 47 (1956-57):58-76, 145-69, espe- cially 151-52, and Salo W.

Most significantly, Palontrotti completely passed over the remaining arguments of Luzzatto's economic apologetica, which really constituted the main thrust of the Discorso and its original element.20 Characteristically, he failed to challenge Luzzatto's calculation of the profit derived by the Vene- tian treasury from the Jews, which Luzzatto himself had said was open to criticism.2 Palontrotti resumes his response with comments on the tenth consideration, which served as a transition from commercial and fiscal utili- tarianism to religious apologetics and contained an appeal to the Venetian sense of justice and nobility. In the Bible, Luzzatto claimed, God preferred to be called the father of orphans and judge of widows rather than the oppressor of proud monarchs and subjugator of tyrants. Similarly, God's clemency was used more in aiding the depressed and lowly than the exalted and noble, like the rays of the sun which warm the lower atmosphere next to the earth more than the upper which is closer to it, and rulers being repre- sentatives of God, should be clement as is God himself. Luzzatto then related having heard from an experienced and wise statesman who was the minister of a great prince that upon arriving in a city where Jews lived, he did not know a better way of ascertaining the true sentiments of the ruler and the real nature of the government than by carefully examining the man- ner in which it treated the Jews. Benevolence and justice shown toward the native population could derive from a spirit of weakness and fear; humane- ness to foreigners could result from obsequious respect for their ruler, but justice, clemency and protection shown toward the Jews could have no cause other than the noble virtue of an ingenuous spirit, naturally disposed to raise the oppressed and assist the weak, for the Jews were not only of meek and humble spirit and always used to taxes and oppression and con- sequently accustomed not even to emit a languid lament, but also com- pletely without any special ruler in any region of the earth who would be their protector and defender.22 20.

The protection granted by rulers to the Jews results from their mercy, which is concerned with human misery. Just as merciful God, like the sun, is concerned not only with the high and the sublime but also with the humble and depressed and shares his favor equally, so too rulers called by the name of God, elohim, are like many suns which spread their warmth and rays uniformly and regard benignly esteemed things as well as abominable ones. For although the Jew is the abominable excrement of the earth, he too participates in the good which rulers dispense liberally as a result of their clemency rather than the merits of those who receive it. And this clemency of theirs toward the Jews is not only the virtue of an ingenuous spirit, but also has a divine element, for it was a doctrine taught by Jesus Christ, the true God of Israel, who said "love thine enemies," the Christian loving the Jew as a creature of God, even though through his own fault he has fallen from grace. The rulers treat him well in order to clasp him in the love of God, so that freed from the snares of diabolical servitude, he will return to his natural liberty. But, continues Palontrotti, even though as our enemies they are to be loved, as enemies of God they are to be subjugated and oppressed, for they not only are opposed to God and to the Messiah, but as a consequence they violate the divine and human laws. Palontrotti claims that he could respond in the words of Augustine that the Jews are tolerated because of the divine wish to show the justice of God. What is worse, he asks, for a king to lose his kingdom and life in battle or to fall alive among the booty into the hands of the enemy? Certainly, to remain alive in the hands of the enemy constitutes a worse punishment for a noble person, as proven by Saul, who when wounded asked his armor-bearer to kill him so that he would not fall alive into the hands of the Philistines. Once, the Jews were the kingdom and priesthood of God, but they rebelled and were deprived of all well-being and now, for greater torment, God wishes that they live, albeit divided and fragmented throughout the world in eternal humiliation. Thus, his rigorous justice is meted out to the rebels and they are confounded, seeing the nations reinvested in the kingdom and grace, and as a result they are consumed by rage and envy. You say, Palontrotti turns to address Luzzatto in concluding his critique of the tenth consideration of the Discorso, that the Jew sometimes, when he is oppressed, does not lament.23 23. "Voi dite, che se l'Ebreo tal volta vien' aggravato, non si lamenta"; these general words were not used by Luzzatto, who wrote specifically "sempre avvezzi nelle gravezze e oppressioni che perb sono acostumati di non esalare pur un languido lamento"; Discorso, consideration 10, fol. 35r, Hebrew translation, p. 103.</page><page sequence="10">310 BENJAMIN RAVID But this is not a virtue as you presume, but feigned forbearance, since by nature the Jew is quarrelsome and complains for any reason. He is quiet and dissembles outwardly because he is afraid, but inwardly he schemes dia- bolical thoughts and kills himself with his own poison. Palontrotti continues with a critique of the following eleventh considera- tion.24 In that consideration, Luzzatto had claimed that if it was difficult to describe the inner characteristics of an individual, how much more so was it to describe those of an entire nation, especially that of the Jews, who were scattered all over the world and acquired various customs from the nations among whom they lived. Nevertheless, he concluded, should anyone still desire to investigate their customs in general, it could be said that they are a nation of a very abased spirit and weak, in- capable in their present state of any political government, occupied in their individual interests, little or not at all providing for their general; their par- simoniousness approaches stinginess; they greatly admire antiquity, and con- sider little the present course of events; many of them are rough in manners, applying themselves little to learning and the knowledge of languages; in the observance of their laws, according to the opinion of others, in some matters they exceed the limit, and approach scrupulousness. To these shortcomings other qualities worthy of some observation can be contrasted: indescribable firmness and tenacity in the belief and observance of their religion; uniformity of dogma regarding their faith for the course of 1,550 years during which they have been dispersed all over the world; admirable constancy if not in confront- ing dangers, at least in enduring calamities; a singular knowledge of the sacred scripture and its interpretation; human compassion and hospitality toward anyone of their nation, even if he be a stranger or foreigner, for the Persian Jew grieves and commiserates with the travails of the Italian, the distance in location not causing any division among them because of the uniformity of religion. There is a great abstinence from the carnal vices; they are careful and precise in preserving their race unmixed and pure; many of them are skilled in dealing with all kinds of difficult affairs; they are submissive and deferential toward anyone not of their religion; their faults and delinquencies almost always partake more of the base and the abject than of the heinous and great. For this reason, Luzzatto continued, if it should happen that a Jew com- mits a crime, as will often happen in any people, and disobeys the laws of the 24. Discorso, consideration 11, fols. 35v-40r, Hebrew translation, pp. 104-8.</page><page sequence="11">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 311 ruler, the remedy is easy. Evil actions can be divided into two kinds. The first kind consists of deeds which, although wicked, have as their aim only personal benefit and will not spread, and indeed are confined to a few guilty ones who will not involve others because it is not in their interest to do so; in these cases, the ordinary magistrates can cope with the situation with the usual penalties of exile, prison, galleys, mutilation of limbs and death. The offenses committed by the Jews, driven by the greed for goods or similar baseness, were always of this kind. Evil deeds of the second kind, however, are contagious in nature and extend to and penetrate an entire nation and cannot be carried out without a total conspiracy such as the rebellion of a people, a change in religion, an invasion of a city, or an insurrection against the existing order and civil state. Such crimes are especially frightful and ter- rible, since the very punishments and penalties are considered by the per- petrators to be the prizes and glorious rewards for their deeds, and, rather than fleeing death in horror, they meet it joyously as often happens in cases of vindication of liberty and change of religion. Luzzatto pointed out that only in the case of the worshipping of the golden calf (even though not all were guilty) and also in the rebellion of Korah against Moses did God casti- gate all the people, because all were inclined and ready to commit such excesses, but this never happened in the cases of other transgressions, for God always judged the people individually. However, in the above two cases, the ordinary punishments of the lower magistrates were not adequate, and God had to intervene with the eminence of his majesty and supreme authority and eliminate the evil by complete destruction. Moving on to the postexilic experience of the Jews, Luzzatto pointed out that in the course of the past 1,550 years (i.e., from the destruction of the Second Temple to his own day), the wicked actions of the Jews had never been of such a pernicious nature. It is true, he conceded, that in the works of the classical historians one reads of certain rebellions in the time of Trajan in Alexandria and a little later in Cyprus, but this was at a time when the Jews participated in the government of cities and near the time of the captivity of Titus (i.e., the destruction of the Temple), when they still retained some of their "native ferocity." Finally, motivated by his desire to avert the expulsion threatening the Jews of Venice, Luzzatto concluded that condemning the group on account of an individual was against both natural and divine law. Nothing in this world was so perfect that it could not be misused: Iron, so needed for so many instruments necessary for human life, was often a means of killing and slaughter, while speech, which so ennobled mankind, was also often a cause</page><page sequence="12">312 BENJAMIN RAVID of misfortune and ruin; nevertheless, no legislator had ever sought to pro- hibit the excavation of iron or to forbid human speech. Even in the case of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, who had exceeded the highest apex of wickedness and enormity, God was willing for the innocence of ten men25 to avert the punishment deserved by such a great number of people. Thus, it was most inappropriate that a few offenders in a people should suf- fice to provoke the public's indignation against all of them. Palontrotti commences his critique of the eleventh consideration by repeating Luzzatto's statement that since the Jews were dispersed in various countries, one could not describe their nature and customs, and he repro- duces, with some misrepresentation and distortion, the basic characteristics enumerated by Luzzatto in the passage quoted above.26 Then he comments on many of these qualities, noting that his presentation should be lengthier, but that he will be brief. The Jew is truly vile (reading Luzzatto's invilito as vile), indeed most vile in spirit, without prudence and without intelligence. 25. The text of the Discorso (fol. 40r) reads "cinque"; however this was corrected to "dieci" on the errata list printed immediately following the title page in some copies of the 1638 edition of the Discorso. The Hebrew translation of 1950 (p. 108) also renders the number as five, with a note pointing out that the number given in the Bible, Genesis 18:32, is ten. 26. The distortions are especially evident in the negative characteristics conceded by Luz- zatto. His statement that the Jews are "d'animo molto invilito e fiacco" is rendered by Palon- trotti as "d'animo fiacco e vile"; "incapace nel stato presente d'ogni governo politico" becomes "incapace di governo"; "poco overo niente providi del loro universale" becomes "poco pro- vido"; "la loro parsimonia avvicinarsi all'avaritia" becomes "pid tosto avaro che parco"; "molti d'essi rozi di costumi" is reduced to "rozzo di costumi"; "poco applicati alle dottrine e cognitioni delle lingue" is accurately rendered as "poco applicato alla dottrina et alla cogni- tione delle lingue"; however, Luzzatto's qualified concession that "nell'osservare la loro legge, secondo il parer d'altrui, in alcune cose eccedendo il limite accostarsi alla scrupulosita" becomes merely a run-on clause following the above quoted "cognitione delle lingue" as "et all'osservanza della legge." On the other hand, Luzzatto's enumeration of the strong points of the Jews is reproduced more accurately, albeit succinctly. Luzzatto's introductory phrase "alli quali mancamenti si contrapongono altre qualitA degne d'alcuna osservatione" is rendered by Palontrotti simply as "se ben ?"; Luzzatto's "fermezze e tenacitA indicibile nella credenza et osservatione della loro religione" becomes "tenace nella religione"; "uniformith di dogmi circa la loro fede per il corso di 1550 anni che sono dispersi per il mondo" becomes "unita de dogmi circa la fede"; "costanza mirabile se non nell'incontrare li pericoli al meno nel supportare le calamitA" becomes "costanza nel supportare calamit."; "cognitione singolare della sacra scrit- tura e sua interpretatione" becomes "singolare cognitione della scrittura sacra e sua interpreta- tione"; "humana caritA et hospitalitA verso qualunque della loro natione ben che estero e forastiero" becomes "caritA grande tra di loro"; "la distanza del loco non cagiona in fra essi disunione, essendovi l'uniformitA della religione" is reduced to one word "unione"; "circa li vitij carnali astinenza grande" becomes "astinenza de vitij carnali grande"; finally "soggettione e ossequio verso qual si sia fuori della loro religione" becomes "soggettione, etc."</page><page sequence="13">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 313 He is not only avaricious but most avaricious, he is devoid of both learning and knowledge of the law of God and is enveloped in superstitions and human laws. He is not only tenacious but pertinacious in his fantasies. No reason can move him, since he has obfuscated his intellect and perverted his will in order always to resist the Holy Spirit. Addressing Luzzatto directly, Palontrotti asks him where that uniformity of the dogmas of the Jews which he imagined is, for already in the Talmud the Jews were divided between Hillel and Shammai. Without any further elaboration, he relates that differ- ences of opinion exist between rabbis in his own time, for "today in Rome some of the Jews explicitly deny the doctrines of the Talmud, being con- vinced by reason that it is repugnant to nature and to God, the creator of nature.""27 The perserverance which Luzzatto claimed, Palontrotti con- tinues, is not a virtue but simulated forbearance and compulsory endurance, because the Jew is very disinclined to suffer voluntarily, and if the Jews tolerate hardships in captivity, it is not voluntary but necessary. Further- more, how can the Jews have a singular knowledge of Scripture, if Luzzatto himself says that they are little devoted to learning and the observance of the law.28 Palontrotti continues by expressing his astonishment that Luzzatto dared to say that among the Jews there is harmony and compassion29 if they themselves admit to being in captivity on account of hatred without cause.30 27. The reference to the disagreement among "rabbis of our times" must involve minor issues of ritual observance. I have so far not encountered any information on Jews of Rome who explicitly denied the doctrines of the Talmud in the late seventeenth century. The possi- bility that there were then in Rome a few individuals, maybe of converso-marrano background, who had difficulties in accepting the talmudic tradition cannot be precluded; alternatively, per- haps the reference is to Karaites. For an introduction to the problem of Jewish heresy in the seventeenth century, see Ellis Rivkin, Leon Da Modena and the Kol Sakhal (Cincinnati, 1952), pp. 1-17, which first appeared in Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s. 38: (1947-8). 28. Palontrotti renders Luzzatto's "poco applicati alle dottrine e cognitioni delle lingue" as "poco applicato alle dottrine e all'osservanza delle legge." 29. Palontrotti renders Luzzatto's "humana caritA e hospitalitA" as "unione e carith." 30. Presumably the Italian odio senza causa is a translation of the Hebrew phrase sin'at .in- nam, which apparently appears only once in rabbinic literature in the following context. The rabbis of the talmudic period (A.D. 200-500) did not wish to explain the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. or that of the Second Temple by the Romans in A.D. 70 in political-military terms, but rather sought a religious-theological reason. Accordingly, in B.T. Yoma 9b, it is explained that the First Temple was destroyed "because of three things: idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. .... But why was the Second Temple, when they were occupied with Torah, commandments and charitable deeds, destroyed? Because hatred without cause prevailed. This teaches you that hatred without cause is of the same weight as idolatry, immorality and bloodshed."</page><page sequence="14">314 BENJAMIN RAVID Either the hatred is not among themselves and it is without cause against Jesus Christ, or indeed if it is among themselves, there cannot be any com- passion and harmony. However, Palontrotti concedes, when it comes to the other nations the Jews unite to their harm and deceit, and instigated by the iniquitous talmudic laws, they permit the ruin of their neighbor, priding themselves that God only "is enthroned upon the praises of Israel" (Psalms 22:4). Luzzatto's claim that the Jews abstain from the carnal vices is termed an exaggeration by Palontrotti and characteristically answered not with evi- dence of immorality within his contemporary Jewish communities of Venice, Rome or elsewhere, but rather with the citation of biblical verses from the prophets denouncing immorality during the period of the First Temple. Moving on, Palontrotti advises anyone who wishes to know the filth invent- ed by the rabbis to read the Talmud; in order not to offend chaste ears, he will pass over the material, only pointing out that they permit anal inter- course with their wives.31 Finally, Palontrotti attributes the fact that the Jew remains subject to rulers and does not rebel to cowardice and fear, for they even are afraid where there is no fear. But one should not be surprised at this, he grants, considering the slaughter made by Hadrian at Bethar, when the people arose and acclaimed Bar Kosibah as the Messiah. The Shevel Yehudah32 relates a very large number of massacres, in Persia, England and elsewhere, in which hundreds of thousands were put to death. The subjuga- tion of the Jew does not result from the virtue of humility, since he is most arrogant and does not undertake what he is unable to, remaining always full of very evil desires, but enduring so as not to lose his property and life. After a very long and vituperative digression presenting an exposition of what he claims to be the nature of the Jew and the significance of the name Ebreo, based solely on biblical verses, Palontrotti returns to the Discorso, 31. The classical Jewish authorities permitted all forms of sexual relations between husband and wife, but in the case of nonvaginal intercourse, ejaculation was strictly forbidden. I wish to thank Marvin Fox for drawing my attention to Nedarim 20b and Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Forbidden Intercourse 21:9. 32. The Shevel Yehudah is a sixteenth-century text written primarily by Solomon ibn Verga, who had been among the Spanish exiles, and was first published, with some additions, by his son Joseph in 1554; see Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Ibn Verga, Joseph"; "Ibn Verga, Solo- mon." The specific incidents cited by Palontrotti are to be found on pp. 21 and 66 of the Hebrew text, edited by Azriel Shohat (Jerusalem, 1947).</page><page sequence="15">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 315 specifically to the twelfth consideration.33 There, Luzzatto had analyzed the causes of the hatred of the Jews. He divided the opponents of the Jews into three groups, religious zealots, statesmen (politici and statisti), and the com- mon people, and then after indicating the main complaint of each group, offered a brief refutation of their hostile positions. The religious zealots, Luzzatto claimed, complain that tolerating those who are not of the gener- ally approved religion is a contempt of religion. In answer, he pointed out that it can easily be responded that they ought to curb their pious zeal and observe that the head of the Christian religion allows the Jews to dwell in his own city of residence (Rome), where they have already lived for over 800 years and have been ruled with justice and compassion, and no one should aspire to know more in matters of religion than its head. Statesmen claim that it is not proper to tolerate diversity of religion in the same city, both because of the scandal and bad example that one religion can derive from the other and also on account of the dissensions, disunion and hatred that may arise among the inhabitants. To this, Luzzatto responded that no scan- dal or bad example could result from the presence of the Jews, since there is so little contact between Jews and Christians, their rites are so dissimilar, and also their books are written in different languages. Furthermore, both are forbidden from dwelling together (Luzzatto here, as so often, describes specific conditions in Venice where a ghetto existed), social contact is limited by the Jewish dietary laws, while carnal intercourse is forbidden by both Jewish and state law and severely punished. Also, the weakness and subjec- tion of the Jews leads to their being shunned and avoided by non-Jews, who rarely convert to Judaism. Then, regarding discord and dissension, Luzzatto claimed that the Jews and Christians were not opposites, as black and white which being both subsumed under the genus color are incompatible, but rather diverse as the sweet and the red, which are wholly distinct and have nothing in common, except that they are both subsumed under the most general genus of quality. Thus separated, Jews and Christians rarely come to strife and conflict over matters of religion, especially since the Jews, because of the conditions of the times and their main teachings, are far removed from all thoughts of spreading their religion; they are occupied only in pro- viding for their needs and do not aspire in any way to improve their general condition since any such attempt would certainly incur death. The states- men, Luzzatto continued, advance another complaint against the Jews, that 33. Discorso, consideration 12, fols. 40v-46r, Hebrew translation, pp. 108-13.</page><page sequence="16">316 BENJAMIN RAVID of usury, a crime not only condemned by divine law, but also universally prohibited by the civil law as an exterminator of wealth and destroyer of families. Luzzatto responded that the usury practiced by the Jews is tolerat- ed by their laws rather than expressly allowed, as he will elaborate upon later.34 Additionally, he continued, it can be affirmed with great probability that those who maintain themselves from usury are very rare, for since their domestic expenses are very great, it is inconceivable that they could sustain themselves with an activity not authorized or permitted by the law of the ruler. 35 Luzzatto continued by pointing out the disadvantages under which the Jewish moneylenders operated. They could not at any time compel Chris- tian borrowers to redeem the pledges and thus once they had invested their capital, could not get it back but had to await the desire and the convenience of the Christian to redeem his pledge.36 If monti di pietai, such as those of 34. See consideration 13, fol. 47r-v, Hebrew translation, p. 114 and consideration 14, fols. 55r-56r, Hebrew translation, pp. 121-22. Luzzatto also deals with moneylending in the ninth, fourteenth and seventeenth considerations of the Discorso; for a brief discussion of his presen- tation in the ninth consideration, see Ravid, Economics and Toleration, pp. 88-92, also n. 39, below. 35. This point of Luzzatto's is remarkable, since the Venetian government had allowed the Jews to engage in moneylending for over 250 years prior to the writing of the Discorso, and for over a hundred years had issued charters specifically permitting them to do so in the city of Venice itself. In fact, on occasion the government explicitly stated that the presence of the Jews was tolerated only to prevent Christians from lending money at interest to fellow Christians. For Jewish moneylending in Venice prior to 1509, see Brian Pullan, Rich and Poor in Renais- sance Venice (Cambridge, 1971), pp. 443-75; Reinhold Mueller, "Les preteurs juifs de Venise au moyen age," Annales 30 (1975):1277-1302; David Jacoby, "Les juifs i Venise du XIVe au milieu du XVIe siecle," Venezia centro di mediazione tra oriente e occidente, 2 vols.

On the activity of the Jewish moneylenders in Venice from 1509-1618, see Pullan, Rich and Poor, pp. 476-578, specifically p. 521 for the statement that the Jews were tolerated only to prevent Christians from engaging in moneylending, and Benjamin Ravid, "The Socioeconomic Background of the Expulsion and Readmission of the Venetian Jews, 1571-73," Essays in Modern Jewish History: A Tribute to Ben Halpern, eds. Frances Malino and Phyllis Cohen Albert (East Brunswick, N.J., 1982), pp. 27-55. 36. This statement is somewhat inaccurate. While it is true that once the Jewish money- lenders had accepted the pawn, they could not compel the Christian borrower to redeem it for one year, elaborate provisions had been formulated for enabling the Christian to redeem it at the end of the year; should he be unable to do so, the pawn was to be sold at auction under the supervision of the Venetian magistracy of the Sopraconsoli, with the Jew receiving his capital and interest and any excess sum going to the original Christian owner. For the exact provisions, see clause 18 of the charter of the Jewish moneylenders of 1624, still in effect at the time of the writing of the Discorso, published in Ravid, Economics and Toleration, pp. 115-17.</page><page sequence="17">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 317 Padua, Vicenza,37 and Verona in which hundreds of thousands of ducats were invested for the sake of the needy, could not sell their pledges after one year, in a short time they would be out of money with all their capital tied up. Therefore, it was inconceivable that the Jews, who in comparison had less wealth, could long maintain themselves in so disadvantageous an under- taking, and, especially since they could legally engage in trade, would expose their possessions to such restrictions.38 In actuality, Jewish moneylending was an activity of orphans and widows, rather than of traders. Moving from the specifics of the Venetian situation to the problem of moneylending in general, Luzzatto maintained that those who attack the Jews ought to consider usury a sin always condemned, but still practiced in all times and places because of the convergence of two great stimuli of human weakness: the necessity of the borrower who pays the usury and the insatiable greed of the lender who receives it. But, Luzzatto suggested, if this transgression were not committed by the Jews, perhaps others would not be lacking who would exercise that depraved profession of moneylending with a greater extortion of the poor and needy, since the number of the usurers would have been reduced. Luzzatto related that some, intending to defame the Jewish moneylenders, had called them the bilge and sewer of every foul business, and turning this insult into something positive, he pointed out that perhaps this indicated the need and urgency of moneylending, since the bilge was of the greatest necessity to the ship and the sewer to the sumptuous palace. He was not writing this, he reaffirmed, to defend such actions, but to point out that they, like some others, were not the essential properties of the 37. Incorrectly rendered as Venice in the Hebrew translation (cf. fol. 42r and p. 109). No monte di pieta was ever established in Venice because of the presence of the Jews, who especially from 1571 on were in effect running a monte dipiet6; see David Kaufmann, "A Contribution to the History of Venetian Jews," Jewish Quarterly Review, o.s., 2 (1889-90):303; Leon Poliakov, Les banchierijuifs et le Saint Siege du XIlle au XVIIe siecle (Paris, 1967), pp. 271-81, abridged English edition: Jewish Bankers and the Holy See from the Thirteenth to the Seventeenth Century (London, Henley, and Boston, 1977), pp. 199-210; Pullan, Rich and Poor, pp. 499-504, 538-40; Ravid, Economics and Toleration, pp. 90-92; Ravid, "The Socioeconomic Background," pp. 47-48. 38. Here again, the presentation of Luzzatto reflects the Venetian situation, where from the mid-sixteenth century on, the loan banks were no longer sources of revenue, but rather deficit incurring institutions financed by corporate assessments not only on the German Tedeschi Jews of Venice, but also after 1591 on the communities of the terra ferma and after 1597 on the Jewish merchants residing in the city; see Pullan, Rich and Poor, pp. 569-71; Ravid, Economics and Toleration, p. 28, n. 24; and Ravid, "The Socioeconomic Background," pp. 48-49.</page><page sequence="18">318 BENJAMIN RAVID Jews, as many asserted, but rather were by chance caused by the difficulties of life and the conditions of the times.39 As could be expected, Palontrotti raises many objections to arguments advanced by Luzzatto in this twelfth consideration. First, regarding the toleration of the Jews, especially in Rome, Palontrotti claims that the great- ness of rulers is displayed more by showing clemency to enemies than by taking revenge. Moreover, they tolerate the Jews in order to carry out the divine wish, reflecting divine justice which, no matter how much it punishes them, still does less than they deserve in order to make them convert at the end of days, when "all Israel shall be saved" (Romans 11:26). Using the traditional Augustinian analogy of Cain, Palontrotti points out that God did not want the Jews to be destroyed, but rather that they live wounded among a thousand deaths for having killed Jesus. Rulers, and especially the pope who holds the place of God, tolerate them in order to bring them to the true faith and knowledge. And if the Jews abuse this clemency, it is because God permits them to do so, since he has blinded them and does not wish that they convert. 39. In his justification of Jewish moneylending at interest, Luzzatto was clearly on the defensive in the light of previous Christian attacks. A discussion of Jewish moneylending activi- ties is far beyond the scope of this paper. Here, it suffices to note that according to Judah Rosenthal, "Usury from a Gentile" (Hebrew), Talpiot 5 (1951-2):475-92, 6 (1952-53):130-52, reprinted in Studies and Texts in Jewish History, Literature and Religion (Hebrew), 2 vols. (Jeru- salem, 1967), 1:253-323, "no new ideas regarding interest are to be found in the book of Luz- zatto," Studies, p. 316. However, for a slightly more favorable evaluation, see his concluding sentences two paragraphs later. See also Siegfried Stein, "The Development of the Jewish Law on Interest from the Biblical Period to the Expulsion of the Jews from England," Historia Judaica 17 (1955):3-40, and also his "Interest Taken by Jews From Gentiles: An Evaluation of Source Material (Fourteenth to Seventeenth Centuries)," Journal of Semitic Studies 1 (1956): 141-64.

Palontrotti does not believe that Luzzatto really ever thought this, unless, however, he was speaking ironically, as Palontrotti indeed believes. The enmity between the Jew and the Christian is greater than that between the wolf and the lamb, because the Jew always desires to devour the Christian; consider the precept, tov she-ba-goyim harog (Kill the best of the goyim).40 Palontrotti states that he will not elaborate further on this, since the Jewish poison is too evident. Look, he relates, in the first order of the Talmud, in the first 40. This phrase is encountered in rabbinic literature, sometimes in slightly variant forms, and was already utilized in Judeo-Christian polemics by Nicholas Donin at the disputation over the Talmud in Paris in 1240 in the distorted form not encountered in rabbinic literature: "optimum Christianorum occide"; "kill the best of the Christians." It should be pointed out that the word goy means nation in general in the Bible and in rabbinic literature, but in medie- val European Jewish usage, the word goy and its plural form, goyim, was used to refer to Chris- tians, since the Jews lived in a Christian environment. This rabbinic phrase continued to be invoked by Christian polemicists in the following centuries. As a reaction to charges against certain problematic sayings of individual rabbis in rabbinic literature, postrabbinic sages affirmed the difference between the halakhic and the aggadic material in rabbinic literature: The halakhah, consisting of legal rulings, was binding on all Jews, while the aggadah, represent- ing the nonlegal sayings of individual sages, was not binding and did not have to be accepted. Obviously, the phrase in question fell in the category of aggadah, not halakhah. Modern scholars and apologetes alike continued to reiterate the distinction between halakhah and aggadah and the meaning of the word goy in rabbinic literature (Christians would have been called no;erim; see above, note 18). Additionally, they introduced the element of explaining the statement in terms of the personality of the individual who made it, the context in which it was uttered and the general historical background of the times: The phrase was uttered by Rabbi Simeon ben Yobai who had greatly suffered at the hands of the Romans in the second century; apparently in its original exegetical context as commentary on Exodus 14:7, it was used to refer to those Egyptians who, although they feared God, nevertheless at the time of the Exodus from Egypt had lent their horses to their fellow Egyptians to enable them to pursue the departing Israelites who were approaching the Red Sea (accordingly, some versions of the text removed from that Sitz im Leben added the words "be-'et milbamah," "in time of war"); although the formal context of the phrase is exegesis of a biblical verse dealing with the Egyptians, the real import of the remark was anger at the Romans because of the harshness of the Hadrianic per- secutions and the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt. On the invocation of this passage at the disputation of 1240, see Loeb, "La controverse de 1240," 1: 2 56-59, 2: 263-64, 3:55, and also Rosenthal, "The Talmud on Trial," especially pp. 150-5 1, and Baron, Social and Religious History, 9:278-79, note 31. For some modern discus- sions of this passage, see also Lauterbach, Jew and Non-Jew, pp. 185-86 and Bloch, Israel and the Nations, pp. 204-10. Nathan Siisskind, in "Tov Sheba-Goyim .. ." Central Conference of American Rabbis Journal 23 (1976) 2:27-40, makes the interesting suggestion that the word harog should not be taken as a verb in the imperative (kill!), but rather as a noun expressing a usual, constant or notorious activity; thus the passage should be translated as "the best of the goyim is a murderer [of Jews]."</page><page sequence="20">320 BENJAMIN RAVID tractate, fourth chapter (see above) and elsewhere, which Palontrotti says he will pass over in order not to arouse hatred against the Jews. Then Palontrotti moves to the issue of usury, which he states is not only not permitted by any law, but even prohibited, invoking the old Deuter- onomic prohibition: "Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother" (Deuteronomy 23:20). Luzzatto, he writes, asserted that the Christian is Esau, the brother of the Jew; then, Palontrotti continues, the Jews cannot take usury from the Christians, but, he reiterates, it is an irrevocable tal- mudic law in the first tractate of the first order that the Jews by deceit, force or usury take the wealth of the Christians.41 Next, asks Palontrotti, whom is Luzzatto trying to convince that the Jews do not maintain themselves with usury? Perhaps, he asks sarcastically, they become rich from selling rags? It seems to him that only the bankers, who live on usury and iniquity, are wealthy and rich. What wickedness does the Jew not commit out of avidity for money; he loses his wits, becomes blind and doubts the existence of God, all to legitimize his insatiable voracity. Then Palontrotti relates that Luzzatto had added "another, even nicer, proposition": that it was better to allow the Jews to engage in usury so as not to give an opportunity to others to do so at higher rates. How, asks Palontrotti, would rulers permit such a thing which was contrary to the pre- cept of Jesus the true God who said: "Lend, hoping for nothing again" (Luke 6:35). Finally, he inquires, does the usury of the Jew seem light to you? Palontrotti here, like Luzzatto previously, seems to be ignoring the legal and socioeconomic reality that governments were permitting the Jews to lend money at interest both because they could be required to make it available at lower rates of interest, as well as to prevent Christians from engaging in moneylending. Certainly Palontrotti should have known, even if he were not living in Rome itself, that the papacy had specifically authorized the Jews to engage in moneylending in the eternal city.42 Palontrotti com- 41. This time, Palontrotti uses the word "Christians" rather than "gentiles"; see above, note 18. Previously, he wrote "e chi non sa il rigoroso precetto del Talmud, che commanda, che si levi al gentile la robba in qualsivoglia modo, purche non se n'accorga per fuggir i pericoli" and here "e pure e precetto nel Talmud irrevocabile ... che gli Ebrei o per inganno o per forza o con usure tolgano le facoltii de Christiani." 42.

On the moneylending activities of the Jews of Rome, see Attilio Milano, "Richerche sulle condizioni economiche degli Ebrei a Roma durante la</page><page sequence="21">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 321 pletely passes over all acquiescence on the part of the authorities, whether religious or secular, in Jewish moneylending at interest, and does not per- ceive (or admit) that this was the secular rationale for tolerating the presence of the Jews, parallel to the theological Cain argument. Finally, Palontrotti turns to Luzzatto's main argument justifying Jewish moneylending. You defend yourself, he says, by saying that the Jew engages in usury by chance and on account of the straitened circumstances of life. From this, one would infer that a man finding himself in want may disobey the laws of God. What do you think of this conclusion, he asks. And how do other people live without usury, he adds, ignoring the legal restraints on most forms of Jewish economic activity in counterreformation Italy. Palon- trotti concludes his critique of Luzzatto's defense of Jewish moneylending by pointing out that it was very characteristic for the Jew to live from usury and if the possibility to do so were taken away, he would die, like a fish taken out of water. Palontrotti agrees with Luzzatto that the Jews do not seek to propagate their faith. This is borne out by experience, he adds, pointing out strangely that after the coming of Jesus, one does not read of anyone who exposed himself to flames and chains to defend his superstition, as did the Mac- cabean heroes, who truly observing the divine law, all exposed themselves to death. Finally, he concludes, who is so crazy as to join a superstitious reli- gion such as Judaism, which is based only on talmudic fables and lies, for the rabbis themselves admit in the Talmud that the observance of their laws was introduced by a devil called Ben Tamalion.43 clausura nel Ghetto (1555-1848)," La Rassegna mensile di Israel 5 (1930-31):445-65, 545-66, 629-50, 6 (1931-32):52-73, 159-68; also Hermann Vogelstein, Rome (Philadelphia, 1940), pp. 296-302; Cecil Roth, History of the Jews of Italy (Philadelphia, 1940), pp. 317-19, 370; Milano, II ghetto di Roma (Rome, 1964), pp. 85-108, esp. pp. 93-95; Poliakov, Les banchieri, esp. 283-90, Jewish Bankers, pp. 211-18; Baron, Social and Religious History, 14:65-66. In Rome, the interest rate of 18 percent was lowered to 12 percent in 1670, and in 1682, Pope Innocent XII officially ended the licensing system allowing the Jews to operate loan banks, but certain families still continued to do so in the eighteenth century. 43. Presumably Palontrotti is here drawing upon the "explanation" of a talmudic story contained in the Pugiofidei of the thirteenth-century apostate Raymond Martini. The Babylo- nian Talmud Me'ilah 17a-b relates that after the Romans had issued a decree (in the latter days of the reign of Hadrian) forbidding the Jews from keeping the Sabbath and circumcising their children and requiring them to have intercourse with menstruant women (forbidden by Jewish law), it was decided to send Rabbi Simeon ben Yobai to Rome to try to annul the decree, since he was experienced in miracles. On the way there, Ben Tamalion (identified by the medieval talmudic commentators as a demon or goblin) joined him. Ben Tamalion went ahead and entered the emperor's daughter. According to the medieval exegete, Rashi, the emperor's</page><page sequence="22">322 BENJAMIN RAVID In the thirteenth consideration of the Discorso, Luzzatto claimed that Judaism alone of all religions inculcated in its adherents a concern for those of other faiths, and among many other arguments pointed out that it was considered by the Jews a greater offense to defraud someone of another religion than to defraud a fellow Jew.44 Palontrotti rejects this claim by stat- ing that he does not know whether ignorance or deceit is worse. He does not think that Luzzatto is ignorant, because it is well known, as he said before, that it is a talmudic precept to take away the wealth of the Christians by force, deceit or usury.45 Therefore Luzzatto is employing deceit, and Palon- trotti knows that he is speaking ironically, calling the sweet bitter and the darkness light, as Isaiah had said. The fifteenth consideration of the Discorso is devoted to a very lengthy refutation of the misinformation and distortions about the Jews contained in book five of the Histories of the Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus.46 This consideration, which has not yet been analyzed and remains completely neglected, must be seen in the context of the considerable interest in Tacitus in the seventeenth century, which explains why Luzzatto found it necessary to deal with Tacitus at such length.47 daughter continually proclaimed the name of R. Simeon, who was accordingly invited to come and cure her. When he came, the talmudic tale continues, he called out "Ben Tamalion, leave her," and Ben Tamalion did so. Thereupon, the grateful emperor told R. Simeon to request whatever he wished as a reward, and led the rabbi to the treasure house. There Rabbi Simeon found the text of the evil decrees and tore it to pieces. On the basis of this tale, Martini wrote that the books of the Jews related that God took away from the Jews the observance of the Sab- bath, circumcision and other ceremonial commandments through the Romans, and Ben Tamalion, that is, the devil, returned to them through a certain miracle circumcision, Sabbath and the other holidays so that they could pray and study Torah.

He relates that Tacitus had said that the Jews hated all other peoples and Luz- zatto, while maintaining the opposite, could not prove his case. Actually, Luzzatto in his refutation of this charge had referred his readers to the pre- vious two considerations of the Discorso, claiming that they would show how far removed the allegations of Tacitus were from the Mosaic precepts. He added some views taken from Philo (who, he stated, had been no less learned than Tacitus and almost his contemporary), who had related that while the priests of the nations prayed only for themselves and their own people, the high priest of the Jews prayed not only for all of humanity, but also for nature, since he considered the world his home. Similarly, Luzzatto pointed out that Ezra, after relating that Darius had ordered that a daily offering be provided at the royal expense at the Temple in Jerusalem, explained that the reason for this munificence was "that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons" (Ezra 6:10). If Tacitus had been right in saying that great hatred existed between the Jews and the other nations, why would Darius have been so naive as to enrich the Temple with presents and benefit a people who, instead of blessing other nations, was accustomed to cursing and blaspheming them? And who would be better informed in this matter than Darius, under whose rule the Jews remained for so long a time? Fur- thermore, Alexander the Great, as Josephus related in the Antiquities, demonstrated, not only by offering presents but also by showing respect and reverence, how advantageous he deemed it to have the God of the Jews pro- pitiated and rendered favorable by the prayers of the high priest. Finally, Jeremiah the prophet in the name of God admonished the Jews subject to the Babylonians to pray to God for the well-being and tranquillity of the capital city of Babylon. From this, Luzzatto concluded, one could determine the extent to which Tacitus let himself be carried away by his hatred of the Jews.48 Palontrotti does not even summarize these arguments of Luzzatto. He merely writes, as already stated, that Luzzatto maintained the view opposite to that of Tacitus but could not justify it. Already, Palontrotti continues, Ezekiel confirmed Tacitus, saying that "he devoured men" (19:6), while St. Paul preached that they "displease God and oppose all men" (1 Thes- salonians 2:15), and the talmudic precept lov she-ba-goyim harog contro- 48.

According to Luzzatto's doctrine, Palontrotti continues, should not the Jews, and especially the rabbis, retain hatred as the serpent poison? Has not the iniquitous synagogue always plotted against the Chris- tians, he claims, citing certain alleged Jewish persecutions of Christians and crimes committed against them to support his views. Thus, Palontrotti asserts, the proposition of Tacitus that the Jews hate all the nations, and especially the Christians, is not only true but clearer than daylight, and one can only claim that the Jew, blinded by passion and jealousy, does not per- ceive this. Then Palontrotti addresses himself to Luzzatto's argument that the Jews liked the nations, since it was written in chapter six of the biblical book of Ezra that Ezra had prayed for the health of the Persian king Darius.49 Palontrotti counters this by arguing that since, as Isaiah had pointed out, Cyrus and Darius served as agents of God in building the temple, it was not at all remarkable that the Jews prayed for their health. Also, at that time the Jews were not yet divided into Hebrew seducers and true Jews, the followers of the Messiah, from which division arose the hatred, jealousy and bitterness which kept the Jews oppressed in an endless punishment. Palontrotti relates that Tacitus had asserted that Judaism was a supersti- tious sect, while Luzzatto had denied this, pointing out that superstition was prohibited by divine law.5" The reason for this prohibition, Palontrotti explains, was that God knew that the nature of the Jews inclined to super- stition. Please tell me, he asks Luzzatto, what is the purpose of such dili- gence in slaughtering (i.e., to assure that the meat is kosher) which God has not commanded? Why, when saying the blessings, do the Jews look at their nails (presumably the reference is to a custom associated with the havdalah ceremony at the conclusion of the Sabbath)? What kind of laws are those regarding the bathing of the women, that if the hair remains outside or if she does not take off her ring, she must bathe again (a reference to the laws of the ritual bath [miqveh] which require total immersion in water)? Repeating an argument previously invoked by Karaites and other Jewish critics of the oral law, and disregarding the rabbinic practice of adding "a fence around the law," Palontrotti asks why, if by divine precept Passover is to be observed for seven days, the Jews observe eight. Also, why can one not eat first meat and then cheese, but in the opposite order it is permitted? There are enough of these superstitions to fill a book, he exclaims. 49.

Palontrotti does not reproduce Luzzatto's refutation,51 which commenced with the general observation that although as a pagan Tacitus could not have understood explanations such as the fact that the Sabbath was instituted as a recollection of the creation of the world or of the miraculous liberation from Egypt (the two reasons given for the Sabbath in the two recensions of the Decalogue, Exodus 20:11 and Deuteronomy 5:15), nevertheless, as a master of raison d'etat, he should have understood the Sabbath in political terms. Luzzatto explained that in the first place the day was not dedicated to improper idleness, but rather to the repose of the body, to enable the people to engage more conveniently in contemplation during that time, in accordance with the statement of Scipio Africanus, related by Cicero (in the name of Cato), that he "was never less idle than when he had nothing to do" (De officiis 3); furthermore, since six days were allotted to private affairs, it was desirable that the seventh be devoted to public service. Moreover, Luzzatto pointed out, citing examples from Roman practices, that since man requires rest and desires restrained pleasure and recreation, if a day were not frequently set apart for rest, then idleness and work and business and pleasure would be mixed to the disturbance of civil life. Palon- trotti merely counters that God established a day of rest and many festivals so that man could elevate his spirit to heavenly concerns, but the Jews claim that Sabbath means rest, and that to elevate the thoughts and weary the mind is a more serious undertaking than working with the body and therefore they observe the Sabbath and the festivals by idleness and think only of joy. Thus on the holiday of Purim, he relates, distorting a humorous light-hearted rabbinic saying into a religious requirement, they are commanded to get so inebriated that they cannot discern whether they are saying "cursed be Haman and blessed be Mordecai" or "cursed be Mordecai and blessed be Haman." Next, Palontrotti deals with one point made by Luzzatto in the sixteenth consideration.52 In it Luzzatto had stated that the Jews, once illustrious for their military valor and their knowledge of the arts and sciences, not only completely lost all military glory and became completely fainthearted and enervated in spirit after their subjugation by the Romans and the destruc- tion of the Temple, the invasion of Jerusalem, the oppression of their reli- 51.

He considers it to be the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah that "the wisdom of their wise men shall perish" (29:14). If, he asks Luzzatto, the Jew is without knowledge, how could you previously have stated that the Jews possess the true understanding of Scrip- ture? A liar, Palontrotti tells Luzzatto, must have a good memory. Finally, Palontrotti turns to the last consideration of the Discorso.54 There, Luzzatto, before presenting a survey of the geographic and demo- graphic distribution of the Jewish people, had pointed out that the Jews dif- fered from all peoples and nations in one important respect. The latter all have prescribed periods like all other terrestial objects. After reaching the height of their success, they then descend into the abyss of oblivion, either disappearing completely and becoming transformed into something else or while retaining their essence, breaking up into fragments and losing their continuity like broken glass or divided water. Thus the Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, Romans and all the pagans have completely disappeared and been transformed, so that of some only the name is known, while of others, only some fragmentary recollection remains, as a plank surviving a shipwreck. The Jews did not undergo such changes, but rather, although broken and divided almost into infinite parts and dispersed all over the world, still retained their essential identity to a great extent. Luzzatto stated that doubt- lessly on their own they could not have had such strength to endure for almost 1600 years without the will of the divine majesty which preserved them for reasons known to it. However, according to Luzzatto, even though the captivity and dispersion were the greatest calamities that could happen to a people, rendering it vile and abject, the mockery and scorn of the nations, nevertheless they were very effective for its survival, for they removed envy and suspicion from rulers, and pride and haughtiness from the Jews, rendering them humble and compliant.55 At this point Luzzatto 53. The words of Luzzatto, not accurately reproduced by Palontrotti, were "ma anco quasi s'estinse in loro ogni lume di sapere, e si oscur6 qualunque splendore di eruditione." Palontrotti wrote "ch'affatto sia persa l'eruditione e la sapienza nell'Ebraismo." "Quasi" (almost, nearly) is not the same as "affatto" (completely or entirely). 54.

He recounted that the Jewish sages had contrasted the conduct of Balaam, the former bitter enemy of the Jewish people who, afterwards, wishing to bless them, likened them to the very lofty and robust cedar, with the conduct of Ahijah the Shilonite, the Jew, who prophesying evil which was to befall them, compared them to a marsh reed that bent before every wind. The sages, Luzzatto continued, had pointed out that the threat of the true and pious Ahijah comparing them to the pliant and flexible reed which yielded to all force and therefore remained intact was preferable to the blessing of a Balaam who likened them to the cedar which, while trying to resist the fury of the storm and force of the winds, was often uprooted. Returning to his main theme, Luzzatto asserted that the dispersion not only aided the Jews by rendering them obedient to their superiors, but also preserved them from innovations in dogma and rites which could not penetrate and spread through the entire nation because of its dispersal.56 Palontrotti briefly states that Luzzatto had observed that under their various rulers the Jews did not change but were dispersed throughout the world, and that this dispersion was the cause of their survival. However, for Palontrotti, the dispersion was not a positive factor, but a negative one, for it had been done by God as a testimony to the Christian faith and as a sign of divine vengeance. The survival of the Jewish people was characterized by eternal scorn and disgrace as the penalty for having killed Jesus, just as Cain who, for the crime of fratricide, was to be a fugitive and a wanderer in the land, living with the soul condemned to hell, undergoing thousands of deaths without dying. Referring to Luzzatto's assertion that the Jews, despite their dispersion, retained their essential identity, Palontrotti asks what identity there can be among people living without discipline, God, or law, everyone making his own laws and expounding the scriptures at his own whim and believing and denying whatever he wishes. Turning to the rabbinic dictum mentioned by Luzzatto, Palontrotti accuses Luzzatto of supporting himself on a reed by comparing the Jews to a reed which bends in all direction with the wind. Judaism, Palontrotti con- cludes, is indeed nothing but a reed religion, moved now by the wind of pride, now by the wind of avarice and now by the wind of luxury. On the other hand, the true faithful Christian is like a firm rock facing the waves; like the anvil at the blow of the hammer, he exposes himself for the true faith to hardship, to torments and to martyrdom.

III The second seventeenth-century work containing specific refutations of arguments advanced in the Discorso of Simone Luzzatto is the Via della fede, published by Giulio Morosini, born Samuel Nahmias, in 1683.57 The bilingual Hebrew and Italian title page of the book, first Derekh 'emunah (Way of Faith, set in Hebrew type) and underneath, the Italian translation, Via della fede, clearly indicates that the work was intended for two different groups of readers. In accordance with this plan, the three parts of the book were preceded by two introductions, the first addressed to "the kind Christian reader" and the second to "the dispersed children of Israel of the present captivity." Fortunately, in these two introductions, and especial- ly the second, Morosini included detailed autobiographical information, and consequently much more is known about him than is known about Palontrotti. Morosini commences his introduction for the Jewish readers by asking them first to look over the opening pages in order to find out who the author is, for from the information he gives about himself, they can either decide that he has not undertaken a task in excess of his ability and proceed with a greater desire to read the book, or on the other hand decide not to take the trouble to turn so many pages from which they do not believe they will derive benefit. Morosini states that he hopes to achieve the first result, and declares that he will not relate anything that is not true and that the greater 57.

At present, he commences, he bears the name Giulio Morosini, but if the reader will not know him by that name, just as Joseph's brothers did not know Joseph when they heard him called Zaphenath-paneah in Egyptian, he will follow the example of that great patriarch who finally, in order to make himself known to them, said to them: "I am Joseph your brother" (Genesis 45:4), and accordingly add that he is, or rather was when he lived among the Jews, Samuel ben Nahmias, the son of David and grandson of Isaac called the ba'al teshuvah (penitent).58 His family, according to a very old tradition and genealogy list which it still possessed, was descended from the biblical Nehemiah who, together with Ezra and other leaders of the Jewish people, restored the temple of Solomon and called upon the citizens to rebuild it. Therefore, the family crest portrayed an armed man standing on a tower holding in his right hand a flag unfurled in the wind in recollec- tion of his very fine action, as could be seen in the frontispiece of a book entitled 'Ein Yisra'el, reprinted by his father in Venice in 1625; however, Morosini concedes, these matters cannot be asserted unquestionably because of the length of the exile and the disorder of the tribes.59 58. Ba'al teshuvah is written in Hebrew characters and also in transliteration in Latin characters. (The statement in Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Morosini, Giulio" that Morosini's grandfather Isaac was "referred to as 'Paul Teshuvah' " probably results from a misreading of a handwritten "baal" as "Paul.") It should be noted that many biblical phrases and Hebrew names, book titles and expressions are set in Hebrew type, often, as in this case, also with a transliteration according to the Italian pronunciation and an Italian translation. 59. The family crest is not found in the list of Cecil Roth, "Stemmi di famiglie ebraiche italiane," Scritti in memoria di Leone Carpi (Jerusalem, 1967), pp. 165-74. Steinschneider, "Die italienische Litteratur," p. 372 claimed that the family tradition was false and that the family originated in Toledo (i.e., medieval Spain). 'Ein Yisra'el (usually called 'Ein Ya'aqov), a collection of aggadot and midrashim extracted from the Talmud by Jacob ibn Habib, was reprinted in Venice in 1625 (the subtitle of this edition, stating that it is a collection of material in the six orders of the mishnah is erroneous; the Hebrew title page should read D'lo nrw i t Dmr,1nn ,'wi1 n'alK nvIn l ,10o Do0 as do the other editions of 'Ein Yisra'el, rather than ,aw ',, nmtiw , = .. .

The Hebrew preface to 'Ein Yisra'el, written by the "editor" of the 1625 edition, acknowledges the generosity of the brothers David and Joseph Nahmias, sons of Isaac Nahmias, the leaders of the community, who upon hearing that the work was out of print and unavailable at any price, underwrote its republication in accordance with the highest standards on expensive paper of the best quality. (I wish to thank Menachem Schmelzer for sending me a copy of this preface from the volume in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.)

Then, after some time, they moved to Salonica where they traded so successfully for forty years with the money they brought from Spain and increased their wealth to such an extent that they became masters of almost all the trade of the Levant. David died in Salonica and his son Isaac (Morosini's grand- father), after coming to Venice on business as a visiting Levantine Jewish merchant, finally decided to settle in the city with his family and posses- sions. Isaac continued his business in Venice, trading in almost all the com- mercial centers of Europe and after his death, his son David (Morosini's father) in turn continued the business. They were so successful in increasing their wealth that they were considered among the leading merchants of the times.60 The reputation of the house (as, Morosini adds in parenthesis, can be stated without boasting) was increased by the general recognition of its integrity, and the liberality it practiced, not only toward Jews but also equally to all other people, led him to believe that his conversion and that of his brother to the true faith were acts of grace exceeding their merit, grant- ed in part by the Divine Liberality because their predecessors and they themselves had always engaged in the above-stated manner in acts of charity and faithfulness with all. Morosini states that in order to indicate the extent of his family he could write about the wealth it possessed in both the East and the West, but since it is not proper to praise oneself, he would 60. Some evidence of activities of members of the Nahmias family in Venetian maritime commerce has survived. While the records of the actual movements of ships in Venice and their cargoes have not been preserved, Alberto Tenenti found in the archives of two notaries in the Archivio di Stato di Venezia records of formal acts of renunciation on the part of owners of ships and cargoes lost at sea in cases of piracy, shipwreck, fire or other accidents in return for the payment of the insurance premium. Tenenti integrated the material and tabulated it in four columns: 1) name of ship, owner, route and fate (or as much of that data as available), 2) names of insurers, 3) names of insured parties (with the amount of liability where given), and 4) merchandise (where given). Four members of the Nahmias family, David, Isaac, Raffael and Solomon, appear in these records. Incidentally, one member of the Luzzatto family, Isaac-possibly the father of Simone-is also encountered. For the references, see the index of Alberto Tenenti, Naufrages, corsaires et assurance maritimes a Venise, 1592-1609 (Paris, 1959). The material on the Jews in that volume has been analyzed by Bernhard Blumenkranz, "Les Juifs dans le commerce maritime de Venise (1592-1609)," Revue des dtudes juives 119 (1961): 143-51; see also Baron, Social and Religious History, 14: 344, note 33. See also the comment in the Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. "Nahmias," that Isaac Nahmias, who along with his son David was a prosperous merchant in Salonica in 1611, "is perhaps identical with Isaac ben David, praised for his bounty by Lonzano ('Shetei yadot')."</page><page sequence="31">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 331 rather refer his readers to the posthumous inventory of his father's property made in 1642 by the Venetian Offizio di Petizione and the documents from civil and criminal proceedings involving the family affairs in the Venetian courts which were still pending at the time of the writing of Via della fede.6' Uncomfortable at mentioning the wealth of his family, Morosini claims that he would have passed over it in order not to be accused of boasting unnecessarily, were it not for two reasons: first, so that he would not be accused of having converted out of necessity or other materialistic consider- ations, and second, because from the details about his family and its wealth, one could come to some conclusions about his upbringing, and not consider him to be an ignoramus completely incapable of that understanding which was so important for the health of the soul. Although he admitted that he had never been a rabbi or kabbalist, he claimed that he could understand the literal sense of the sacred books in the original language without a trans- lator, and that he had always been, and would always, to the end of his days, be most familiar with them.62 61. Inventories of the estates of several members of the Nahmias family are indeed extant in the archive of the Giudici di Petizion in the Venetian State Archives; the very detailed inventory of the assets of Isaac son of David Nahmias, presumably identical with the grandfather of Mor- osini (Giudici di Petizion 353/18, July 28, 1631) includes a lengthy listing of books containing his business records. An examination of these inventories and others preserved in the Venetian State Archives would constitute an interesting and significant study. To date, only one such inventory has been published: Clemente E. Ancona, "L'inventario dei beni appartenenti a Leon da Modena," Bolletino dell'istituto della societaM e dello stato veneziano 4 (1962): 249-67. 62. Morosini's claim does not appear to be an idle boast. The text of Via dellafede abounds in quotations from the Talmud, midrashic literature and subsequent rabbinic tradition, the prayerbook and medieval Hebrew literature in general, quoted in Hebrew in Hebrew typeface with an Italian translation. Most of its pages contain some material in Hebrew typeface, either a biblical verse, a quotation from the abovementioned vast range of literature, or a term reflect- ing some religious law, ceremony or Custom of the Jews, with the appropriate Italian transla- tion. For a quick survey of sources quoted or mentioned, see the incomplete "Indice degli autori e de'libri qui citati" at the end of the book. While Morosini took some of his information from previous Christian authors, the wide range of authors cited and extensive quotations in the original Hebrew make it plausible that he was indeed drawing on the education of his youth rather than on later reading specifically undertaken for the writing of Via dellafede. However, in his introduction to the Christian reader, he mentions that friends gave him various books and relevant information, singling out Andrea Peschiulli and especially Giovanni Pastritio, let- tore of dogmatic theology at the Collegio de Propaganda Fede; see also Bartolocci, Bibliotheca magna rabbinica, 3:755-56;, Imbonatus, Bibliotheca latino-hebraica, p. 126, and the penulti- mate paragraph of Morosini's introduction for the Hebrew reader. Interestingly, mention is made on p. 823 of one of the works of Palontrotti, the Raccolta di molti errori e chimere sognate da'Talmudisti sopra l'espositioni della Bibbia, e riferite particolarmente da Rabbi Salomone (Venice, 1649), but there is no mention of Palontrotti's Breve risposta, neither in the few pages of Via della fede devoted to the Discorso nor apparently elsewhere in the book.</page><page sequence="32">332 BENJAMIN RAVID At this point in his introduction to the Jewish reader, Morosini brings up the subject of his conversion, considering it not without value to give a detailed account in order to illustrate that God always desires our welfare and never ceases to give opportunities for repentance. Know, then, he tells his Jewish readers, that living among Christians, as a great number of you still do, and having almost continually to associate with them, he noticed that their customs were more sincere than those of the Jews. This he attrib- uted more to the character of their religion than to that of the people. He heard them saying great things about the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus, and seemed to have seen almost all of them in the preachings of the prophets. He also recollected having heard Leone Modena, who had been one of his teachers and a rabbi of great repute at that time, praise the good- ness of the Christians.63 Additionally, Morosini felt from time to time very pungent secret stimuli in his heart, urging him to embrace Christianity. While he was in such a state of mind, it pleased God to make him hear the last attempt of His divine call in a dispute which took place in Venice between two brothers of Jewish descent whose homeland he will not men- tion out of respect. One of them, who had been pretending to live as a Chris- tian, furtively left his homeland (presumably the Iberian peninsula) and in 1649 came to Venice where he publicly proclaimed himself a Jew. A while later, when his Christian brother found this out, the latter also came to Venice, with the intention of inducing the former to acknowledge his error and return to Christianity.64 Since both were very learned, a great dispute arose between them. Finally, the Jewish brother accepted the proposal of the Christian brother that they would have recourse to the true interpretation of the prophecy of Daniel regarding the seventy weeks, and that the loser was to adopt the religion of the winner. Having reached this agreement, the 63.

Luzzatto then notified the leading rabbis of the academy and the most learned who studied there. On the day set for the dispute, many came, including Morosini and his brother, Joseph. At first the two antagonists quarrelled valiantly. But seeing that the victory was clearly inclining toward the Christian, Luzzatto,66 who was seated at the head as judge of the contest, suddenly banged both hands on the table and said: "The verse which is being disputed, as you know, has left all the most excellent rabbis perplexed and bewildered in such a manner that they do not know whether they are in heaven or on earth." And after some more similar words, he placed his finger on his mouth and added: "Let us kindly be silent and close our books, because if we continue to speculate on this prophecy of Daniel, it will come to pass that we will all become Christians. It cannot be denied that there it is clearly shown that the messiah, whose time is already passed, has come. Whether this is Jesus of Nazareth, I do not wish to decide hastily." Thus, recollects Morosini, the debate ended. He and his brother Joseph lost their feelings for Judaism and both decided to embrace Christianity.67 65. The name is misspelled in both Latin and Hebrew type: Simon Luzzato for Simone Luzzatto, and in the Hebrew with a tav instead of a let. 66. This time correctly spelled with two t's. 67. The words placed in quotation marks were italicized in the text of Morosini and pre- sumably were meant to represent the actual words of Luzzatto. A very brief Latin summary of this incident, with the alleged statements of Luzzatto translated in their entirety, was under- taken by Wolf, Bibliotheca Hebraea, 3: 1127-28; that version seems to have served as the source of information on the incident for subsequent writers. Morosini's account has been reproduced in the original Italian in Angelo Sacerdote, "Simone Luzzatto," In memoria di Angelo Sacerdote (Rome, 1936), pp. 100-1. While Wolf and Giam Battista De Rossi, Dizionario storico degli autori ebrei e delle loro opere, 2 vols. (Parma, 1802), 2: 15 accepted the story at face value, Jewish writers have been more critical. Hananel Nepi and Mordechai S. Ghirondi, Toledot gedolei Yisra.'el (Trieste, 1853), p. 317 denounced "the lying priest De Rossi... who said that a convert wrote that the words of the said Rabbi [Luzzatto] in his commentary on Daniel led him to convert." Graetz considered Morosini to have either distorted or misunderstood the state- ment of Luzzatto, and suggested that Luzzatto could only have maintained that the verse refers not to the messiah but to the period of the Hasmoneans, as Iaim Galipapa had interpreted the passage in Daniel; see Heinrich Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, 11 vols. (Leipzig, 1853-76), 10: 164, note 1, omitted in the English translation. This assessment was repeated in the Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. "Luzzatto"; see also Roth, Venice, p. 231.</page><page sequence="34">334 BENJAMIN RAVID A few months later, on November 22, 1649, Morosini converted at the age of 37,68 which, he claims, shows that it cannot be said that his conversion was an ill advised youthful act. He assumed the name of Giulio Morosini, while his son David, who converted with him, took the name Angelo. His brother Joseph also converted, took the name Ottaviano, and married a Christian of a most respectable family who bore him ten children. Giulio Steinschneider, "Letteratura antigiudaica," p. 373, commented that since Luzzatto had died in 1663, Morosini could relate whatever he wished twenty years later; even if the entire anec- dote were not an invention, the famous author of the Discorso would not have expressed the words ascribed to him by Morosini. More cautiously, in "Italienische Litteratur," p. 418, Steinschneider considered Morosini's account of Luzzatto's alleged utterance regarding the seventy weeks of Daniel to be questionable. Simonsen, "Giulio Morosinis Mitteilungen," p. 340 termed it certainly at least very strongly colored. Ludwig Blau, Leo Modenas Briefe und Schriftstucke, 2 vols. (Budapest 1905), 1: 122, rejected the idea that Luzzatto uttered certain doubts about Jewish doctrine as completely unbelievable. Sacerdote, "Simone Luzzatto," p. 101 stands out as the only scholar not to be so critical, stating that while it is not necessary to dwell on the fact that the account of Morosini is not reliable in its details, nevertheless from it one can at least deduce that Luzzatto was very broad-minded. Shulvass, "Rabbi Simha Luzzatto," pp. 25-26 wrote that most of the scholars who had dealt with this passage considered it to be completely invented, while Simonsen, the only one not to reject it completely, considered it to be very exaggerated. Shulvass himself believed that there was no doubt that the story of Morosini was invented from beginning to end and pointed out that it became almost customary in Italy to relate after the death of Jewish sages, who were well known among Christians, that they either converted or leaned toward Christianity, citing reports that Elijah Levita, Judah Abrabanel and Leone Modena all converted. See also Roth, Venice, p. 231; I have been unable to find any "contemporary Christian observers" other than Morosini; also, to date I have been unable to locate the source for Roth's statement that "cardinal Barberigo used to recount how on his deathbed the freethinking Rabbi [Luzzatto] was only prevented from embracing Christianity by a forcible exercise of authority on the part of his scandalized coreligionists." The information given by Morosini has to be carefully evaluated in the context of the religious climate within the Jewish community of Venice, and especially trends prevalent among the Marranos at the time; see Rivkin, Leon Da Modena and the Kol Sakhal, and Yerushalmi, From Spanish Court. The specific details furnished by Morosini regarding the background of the incident appear to give it some authenticity, and the choice of Luzzatto as thejudge at such a debate cannot be precluded; however the authenticity of the specific words and actions attri- buted to Luzzatto by Morosini remain highly dubious. 68. Thus Morosini must have been born between November 23, 1611 and November 22, 1612; unfortunately, he did not state where he had been born, and conflicting assertions are to be found in the secondary literature that he had been born in either Salonica or Venice. Barto- locci, Bibliotheca magna rabbinica, 4: 404 gave the month of conversion as December, for which he was criticized by Wolf, Bibliotheca hebraea, 3: 1128; see also 3: 1126; however, Wolf himself had given the month of conversion as "1649 22 Dec." on 1: 1121! Bartolocci's source for December is unclear; see however Yerushalmi, From Spanish Court, p. 201, note 14, for a refer- ence to a deposition given by Morosini "to the inquisition in 1661 in which he stated that his baptism took place on Dec. 22, 1649," which would seem to contradict his statement in Via della fede.</page><page sequence="35">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 335 Morosini's own wife, however, obstinately remained a Jew under the influence of her father and the synagogue, and wickedly schemed with them to persecute him in the most cruel ways imaginable, on which, however, he did not elaborate. At this point, Morosini interrupts his autobiography to comment on the prophecy of Daniel in support of the alleged statement of Luzzatto. Then, taking up again the thread of his account, he relates that his pious decision was praised by both the Venetian nobility, especially by Signor Angelo Morosini, the procurator of San Marco, who lifted him from the baptismal font and honored him with his illustrious family name, and also by the lead- ing citizens, some of whom he acknowledges and thanks for their hospitality and support, stating that since he can do nothing else, he will always pray to God that He will make them prosper. Just two months after his conversion, Morosini, according to his own account, began striving to convert the Jews of Venice to Christianity. Ten years later (i.e., in 1659), he moved to Rome where he desired, despite his age and suffering from gout, to obtain papal dispensation to join the Capuchine order. There, he was well received by Monsignor Vizzani Asses- sore, then of the Sant'uffizio, who obtained for him an audience with Pope Alexander VII (1655-1667). In the course of the conversation, Morosini mentioned that since his conversion, he had continually endeavored to con- vert as many Jews as possible to atone for having prevented, while still a Jew, many other Jews from converting. When Assessore added that Moro- sini had not labored in vain, the pope urged Morosini, for the greater benefit of the faith, to remain a layman rather than close himself off in the cloister, citing also the latter's health as an additional factor. The pope assured Morosini of papal protection, consoling him that he would never have to want for anything. This promise was fulfilled; Morosini was given a princi- pal post in the customs and also an assignment in the congregation of the Holy Office and another in the Collegio de Propaganda Fede, both for life. The next pope, Clement IX (1667-1669) appointed him to one of the scritturie (research fellowships) in the Vatican library, a post of notable honor and stipend.69 According to the title page of Via dellafede, Morosini was research fellow of the Vatican library in the Hebrew language as well as 69. This appointment was made after the death of Giovanni Battista Jona, according to Bartolocci, Bibliotheca magna rabbinica, 4: 404; see also 3: 755-56. It appears that Morosini's only other literary activity was the completion of Jona's work on textual variants in the Tar- gumim, still preserved in manuscript.</page><page sequence="36">336 BENJAMIN RAVID lecturer in Hebrew in the Collegio de Propaganda Fede. Then Clement X (1670-1676) assigned Morosini's nephew Lorenzo to the chair of Hebrew at the Sapienza, and Innocent XI (1676-1689) increased Lorenzo's stipend.70 Thus, Morosini summarizes, it pleased God, always infinitely merciful, to bless him again through those great popes. He values more, he claims, his present fortune than the above-mentioned riches left to him by the industry of his ancestors, quoting first in Hebrew and then in Italian Proverbs 30:8-9: "Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with mine allotted bread; lest I be full and deny and say: 'Who is the Lord?' or lest I be poor, and steal and profane the name of my God." Furthermore, he asserts, he has related his felicity gladly, not only because it shows that he was considered to be of some merit by the Chris- tians, but also so that his Jewish readers should know with what charitable zeal the church embraces all-and particularly Jews-who take shelter in its arms, and especially those who have qualities which make them worthy of note in some manner. After at least six years of labor "since it was difficult to be satisfied with that which the pen wrote the first or second time," Morosini completed his literally magnum opus of 1,470 pages.7' Despite his ill health and failing sight, for which reasons, he relates, the publication of his book was hastened so that it would be completed before he died, Morosini appears to have lived for four more years, until 1687.72 70. According to Morosini, another nephew of his, whom he does not name, came from Bosnia in 1660 under his influence to convert, and at the time of the writing of Via della fede was a hermit in Mantovano. 71. Pp. 627-36 appear twice, and an additional 236 unpaginated pages contain corrections and additions (45 pages), a subject index (176 pages), an index of biblical verses (7 pages) and an index of authors and works cited (8 pages). One approbation printed after the table of contents is dated July 24, 1677, while a second is dated July 18, 1683. The text of the book itself contains a reference to the "present year, 5440" which would be 1679-80 (p. 437). The opening dedication of Morosini is dated August 1, 1683. According to the title page, the book was printed in the printshop of the Sacra Congregazione de Propaganda Fede in 1683. Morosini's portrait appears as a frontispiece to the book, and bears the inscription: "iulius maurocenus olim samuel nahmias venetus aetatis suae lxxii anno mdclxxxiii." 72. According to Morosini's fellow research fellow at the Vatican, Bartolocci, whom Morosini calls in his introduction to the Christian reader "a friend of many years" and whose Bibliotheca magna rabbinica he praises (vols. 1 and 2 appeared in 1675 and 1678 respectively; for Bartolocci's praise of Via della fede and acknowledgement of Morosini's utilization of Bib- liotheca, see 3: 755-56), Morosini died in 1687; Bartolocci, Bibliotheca magna rabbinica, 4: 404, and subsequent authors. The date 1683 given in Adler, "The Rise of Art Music," p. 345 and Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Morosini, Giulio," appears to be an error; probably by mis- take the date of the publication of Via dellafede was substituted.</page><page sequence="37">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 337 In his two introductions to Via dellafede, Morosini, in addition to pre- senting biographical information, also sets forth his reasons for writing the book. In his introduction to the Christian readers, he states that three strong purposes induced him to publish his work. First, he wanted to show the Jews that having embraced Christianity, he intended to close his life in it, and the book was his public profession of faith, although the Jews most insolently asserted that all of them, even if they converted to Christianity, could not help dying with the Mosaic law in their hearts. Second, having striven, starting two months after his own conversion, to convert Jews of both sexes to Christianity, both in Venice and in Rome, without sparing money or effort, he has now endeavored to express his way of faith in a book, with the hope that in the future at least a few of the Jews might let themselves be guided by the Holy Spirit by means of his book, just as pre- viously they had by means of his living voice. Third, he was moved by the encouragement he had received from a scholarly and most gracious prelate who once in the course of conversation asked Morosini for information which he then needed about the Jewish rite of circumcision. After Morosini had explained it, the prelate proposed to him that he undertake a compre- hensive exposition of the rites and ceremonies of the Jews for the informa- tion of Christian preachers, since such a work did not exist (as far as he knows, Morosini adds in parentheses) arranged according to his idea.73 Reflecting that he could not disobey such a command, and seeing that he could also thereby carry out his two other above-mentioned aims, Morosini undertook this task after some hesitation, considering it necessary to show the Jews in this manner that they should leave their fallen Mosaic and tal- mudic religion, which was full of superstitions and errors. Unless he is mistaken, he claims, the value of the book will be almost universal. He naively suggests that it would perhaps not be unacceptable to the Jews, since it constituted a new way which would easily attract them for it deals with their ceremonies, nor would it be unuseful since in it they would find the antidote to their poison. Additionally, the book will be necessary for Chris- tian preachers who, for polemical purposes, ought to be informed about what the Jews say and do, while it will not be unrewarding or without use for the other Christians, not only since it is proper to know how a people as old as the Jews, who were once favored by God and possess almost the ori- 73. Presumably the Riti of Leone Modena, to which Morosini often refers (see below, note 76), was not sufficiently detailed; furthermore, a new treatment would present an opportunity to add a critique of the Jewish ritual.</page><page sequence="38">338 BENJAMIN RAVID ginal of a large part of the Scriptures, behave and live, but also because they will find many scriptural verses which will bolster their faith. Finally, it will benefit the Jews, since Christians will be able to talk to the Jews informed about Judaism and, as they try to convert the Jews to Christianity, will have the necessary knowledge. In his introduction to the Jewish reader, Morosini reiterates one of these motives. He writes that the main aim of his labor was to reveal the talmudic superstitions which greatly contaminated the laws of the Jews and to explain away the difficulties, especially the greatest ones, that kept the Jews back from passing from the darkness of the deformed synagogue to the always inextinguishable light of the church of Christ, either by reasons drawn from the Bible or from the interpretations of the early rabbis who were divinely inspired (this, Morosini adds in parentheses, one has to believe because of the admirable harmony that exists among the Jews), rendering the rebel- liousness of their successors completely inexcusable. The first part of the book, pp. 1-99, is entitled "On the Cessation of the Mosaic Law as a Result of the Coming of the Messiah who is Christ our Lord whose Mysteries are Demonstrated." The second part, entitled "On the Cessation of the Ceremonial and Judicial Precepts of the Mosaic Law or of the Jewish Ceremonies Because of the Transgressions, Superstitions and Impieties of the Jews and Through the Replacement by the Ceremonies of the Christian Religion, Especially the Sacraments, Some of which are Demonstrated" is by far the longest (pp. 101-1209). In the course of his pre- sentation, Morosini comprehensively describes the rites and ceremonies of the Jews from birth to death, throughout the year, alleging that they are full of superstitions and transgressions. He indicates his principle of selection in his introduction to the Jewish readers, where he explains that since the Jewish groups differed in their rites, it would be too wearisome to describe them all, and therefore he confined himself only to those of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues, not only because they were more praiseworthy and esteemed than the others (even after his conversion, Morosini apparently retained pride in his ethnic heritage) but also because, while he had been a Jew, he had constantly attended them, both in Italy and in the Levant, and was certain that no one could expound them with greater distinction.74 74. More specifically, Simonsen, "Giulio Morosinis Mitteilungen," p. 339, note 2, has sug- gested that the customs of the Jews reflect the practices of the Jews of Venice primarily and also those of the Ottoman empire where Morosini had traveled in his youth, rather than those of the Jews of Rome (where presumably since he was living as a Christian, he had less intimate contact with their daily lives and customs). A cursory skimming of Via della fede reveals that Morosini</page><page sequence="39">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 339 Finally, the third part of Via dellafede was, according to its title, intended to show that the precepts of the Decalogue were disobeyed by the Jews through their impiety and superstitions. Via dellafede, which, as Cecil Roth has pointed out, is "extraordinarily replete with information for the reconstruction of the social history of the Ghetto in his [Morosini's] day,"" still awaits a systematic examination. Since Morosini in his introduction to the Christian readers mentions Buxtorf and was familiar with Buxtorf's Synagoga judaica, as well as with the Riti of Leone Modena, which is often mentioned in passing,76 it would be of relevance to compare Morosini's treatment of Jewish law with that of Buxtorf and of Modena, and in general analyze it in the context of seven- teenth century Judeo-Christian polemics. Such an undertaking, however, is beyond the scope of this article.77 Rather, relevant in the present context is a passage of Via della fede devoted to a refutation of some arguments in the Discorso. Although this response to the Discorso was already noted by Wolf in his Bibliotheca hebraea in the early eighteenth century, it has never been reproduced, sum- marized or analyzed.78 Incidentally, it would be of interest, as an indication of the extent of the penetration of the Discorso into the Christian world, to know whether Morosini had been aware of that book (published in 1638) while he was still a Jew prior to his conversion in 1649 or whether he only discovered it afterwards. Chapter twelve of the third part of Via della fede is entitled "On the Hatred that the Jews Bear Toward Christians, and the Slandering and Other Effects of This Hate and How in This Too They Transgress the Sixth Com- mandment of the Decalogue." Toward the end of the chapter, after outlining the provisions of the papal bulls issued against the Jews, including the He- often drew attention to differences in customs between the Levantine, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian Jews, and on occasion specifically referred to institutions and practices in Venice, Rome and the Ottoman empire. 75. Roth, Venice, p. 118, see also p. 372. 76. The index to Via dellafede, s.v. "R. Leon di Modena" contains numerous entries, and a cursory skimming of the book yields additional references to Modena and his Riti. 77. See above, note 5 and Mark R. Cohen, "Leone da Modena's Riti: A Seventeenth Cen- tury Plea for Social Toleration of Jews," Jewish Social Studies 34 (1972): 287-321. 78.

At this point,79 Morosini introduces Luzzatto and his Discorso. He relates that "Rabbi Simon [sic] Luzzatto who in Venice had been famous for learning, eloquence and authority [dottrina, eloquenza e autorita]"80 had written in his Discorso in defense of his nation that the scorn that the Jews arouse on the part of governments, the cries of abhorrence which the popu- lace raise against them and the derision of the more common people result from the conditions of the times and the lack of learning among the Jews which would enable the truth to appear and have its say. And, continues Morosini, since Luzzatto could not conceal the excesses of the Jews, on account of which governments had rigorously banished them, Luzzatto con- ceded that some lawless and wicked persons were found among the Jews, but claimed that for this reason the sincere feelings that the Jews in general held toward their most clement rulers should not be obscured or denied. Luzzatto, Morosini relates, had pointed out that just as the skilled agricul- turalist does not abandon a well-cultivated field because it sometimes pro- duces useless grasses and ill born plants, but, extirpating and cutting them down, continues his work with the others, so since the Jews are of great utility to the Christian community, one should not turn against all of them because of some lawless individuals, but rather punish the few guilty ones and continue to protect the rest without rigor.8' Morosini expresses his satisfaction that Luzzatto conceded that the Jews are without wisdom. If they had any, he claims, they would either embrace the true Christian religion or at least cease attacking it, and would not defend falsehood and wickedness unless they deliberately wished to be like those who, ungrateful to their celestial benefactor, defended vice and deceit out of their human self-interest. Morosini relates that Luzzatto in the intro- 79. Via della fede, p. 1415. 80. Cf. this characterization of Luzzatto with the above-cited phrasing in the introduction to the Hebrew reader; on p. 1116 of Via dellafede, Menasseh ben Israel is very similarly charac- terized as "stimato per l'eloquenza, eruditione e dottrina." 81.

The Jews, Morosini continues, are only of value to the state in the same way as the abovementioned persons. Shifting quickly from the economic plane to the theological, he alleges that in fact they are worse, since they sin against religion, and sins against religion are more harmful; blasphemy is worse than prostitution. It is not just the case of the offenses of a few lawless individuals, but of the people in general who use those few as their agents, or at least approve of their actions, and therefore they cannot be compared to a good field which sometimes yields bad plants, but rather to a bituminous whirlpool which throws forth noxious fumes. Morosini now states his intention to refute Luzzatto on the basis of the latter's own arguments. He refers approvingly to the point made by Luz- zatto (already summarized above in connection with the discussion of the work of Palontrotti) in the eleventh consideration, differentiating between the times when an entire people has to be punished and those when only individuals have to be punished.83 He also repeats briefly Luzzatto's distinc- tion in the twelfth consideration84 between the three types of anti-Judaism, that of the populace, of the statesmen and of the religious zealots, and Luz- zatto's refutations of each type: that one should not pay attention to the populace, but rather to the decrees of rulers; that diversity of religion is not 82.

Morosini counters by claim- ing that the wickedness of the Jews is shared by all of them, and that it is not only the opinion of the populace but also of rulers that they should be expelled. Moreover, popes, in bulls issued after a rigorous examination, complained that the Jews always grew more wicked and ungrateful and committed ever greater crimes, and should be exiled from all places; however, they are tolerated by Christian piety in the hope that they will con- vert, and for this reason given some privileges, but they abuse them and become worse. It is rulers who have judged it necessary to expel the Jews from their kingdoms because of the crimes they have committed. This, Morosini notes, is correct also according to the principle of Luzzatto, for since all and not just some are guilty, it is necessary to punish not just some, but all. Morosini then recounts the major expulsions of the Jews. They were exiled from France four or five times. The first time was in 1198 by Phillip II at the beginning of his reign because of the very harsh usury with which the Jews consumed the French and because of their other crimes against Chris- tianity, but he recalled them in the same year because of his need for money. They were banished a second time in 1233 by Louis XI on his return from the Holy Land, because, Morosini relates elliptically, "he discovered what those who could did together with the Moors against the Christians who went to or resided in the Holy Land, although they let some live." They were banished a third time in 1306 by Phillip the Good because of the crimes against religion and also because of usury but were taken back again by his son Louis on his accession to the throne because of his need for money. They were expelled for the fourth time in 1321 in perpetuity because it was discovered that they had poisoned the wells and fountains. However, apparently some returned, since in 1393 they were again afflicted, but "for the same reasons" in 1395 they were completely expelled without ever returning. They were expelled in 1290 from England and also from the lands owned by the king of England in Gascony, because of their superstitious customs and because they led the Catholics astray to Judaism.85 Before that, and at that time, Pope Nicholas IV (1288-1292) inveighed against them, 85. For a discussion of the reasons advanced for the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290, see Henry G. Richardson, The English Jewry under Angevin Kings (London, 1960), pp. 213-33.</page><page sequence="43">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 343 advising both the inquisitors and Christian rulers to free their states of such pests.86 They were expelled from Spain in 1492 by order of Ferdinand and Isabella, and even though it was out of religious zeal after the expulsion of the Moors, it was not for the reason given by Luzzatto that the rulers did not want to tolerate a different religion." The real reason, Morosini explains, was the harm and disgrace that both the Jews and the Moors com- mitted toward religion. He claims that the historians who relate this expul- sion clearly write that the king deprived himself of such a great multitude because he was aware of their many crimes against the Catholic religion, and that it can be concluded from the manner of the terrible expulsion that he would not have done so unless many were guilty, for such a pious king would not have taken such an action had he not discovered that it was a worse evil to tolerate them than to banish them. The experiences of other kingdoms and the reasons for the expulsions show that they were the same or similar to those of Spain. Shortly afterwards, in 1496, the Jews were expelled from Portugal at the urging of Ferdinand of Spain as a condition for King Emmanuel's marrying the latter's daughter, but the reason was the same as that for the expulsion from Spain, that is, because the Jews were known to be bitter enemies of the Christian faith. And since King John of Portugal, the cousin of King Emmanuel, had not admitted the exiles from Spain unconditionally, but for a limited time, it necessarily followed that at the end of that time, they were either to be exiled or placed in servitude. However, since Emmanuel, contrary to that which John had ordered, was contented that they should live in freedom, the king of Spain had just cause for including the banishment of the Jews among the conditions for the marriage. What, asks Morosini, can Luzzatto respond to these charges, made not by individual subjects or by the emotions or tumults of the populace, but by sage rulers whom he calls in the seventeenth consideration "most pru- dent"?88 With cunning and finesse, Morosini continues, Luzzatto utilized all 86. On Pope Nicholas IV and the Jews, see Edward A. Synan, The Popes and the Jews in the Middle Ages (New York, 1965), pp. 122-23, with references to the sources in notes 74-78. Nicholas IV was certainly not one of the more anti-Jewish popes of the Middle Ages and does not seem to have sought their expulsion. Presumably Morosini selected him (rather than a more anti-Jewish pope) because he happened to be pope at the time of the expulsion from England in 1290. 87. Discorso, consideration 17, fol. 87v, Hebrew translation, p. 150. 88. Discorso, consideration 17, fol. 86r, Hebrew translation, pp. 148-49. It should be noted that the adjective cited by Morosini, "prudentissimi," is used by Luzzatto not in the course of presenting his own views, but in summarizing a potential argument against the Jews.</page><page sequence="44">344 BENJAMIN RAVID of his learning to respond in that consideration that every city and country has different ways of proceeding and its own laws, and that the appeal to example and authority had no validity; indeed, if it did, one should conclude that since the most prudent and wise Venetian republic kept the Jews, others also ought to do so. But, Luzzatto had conceded, because of the dislike of the populace toward the Jews, the authorities kept them away, and therefore the Venetian republic allowed them in Venice, but not in Brescia, Bergamo, Crema and other cities in the state. Luzzatto then stated, Morosini relates, that in general the Jews can only maintain themselves by usury, by real estate or by the crafts. Since the first (sic) and the second are prohibited to them, there remains only the third (sic), which is very odious to the populace outside of Venice, because while there the interest rate is only five percent, outside it is higher.89 Then Morosini briefly summarizes Luzzatto's account of the expulsion of the Jews, for each of which Luzzatto had given a specific reason, albeit often remarkably weak:90 They were expelled from Germany at the time of the crusades because the soldiers developed an aversion to all people differ- ent from them, and therefore, very miserably afflicted the Jews; they were banished from France at the same time as the Templars for the reasons given by the historians (Luzzatto did not elaborate upon this cryptic statement); from Spain, since it was not expedient for the government to keep so many thousands of Moslems and Jews, differing in religion, because the prudent ruler could come to suspect that they might plan a revolution, and he chose to expel the Jews and not the Moriscos because the Jews, unlike the Moors, had no head or king, and also because the Moriscos cultivated the land, unlike the Jews to whom every craft was forbidden. Finally, Luzzatto had said that they were expelled from Portugal because of the continual persua- sion of the king of Spain and because King Emmanuel of Portugal needed 89. Discorso, consideration 17, fols. 86v-87r, Hebrew translation, p. 149. It is obvious that Morosini has confused things here. If he presents the economic possibilities in the order of usury, real estate and crafts, then he should have stated that the first is permitted to the Jews, while the second and third are prohibited. Clearly a slip of the pen took place. In the Discorso, Luzzatto presented the activities in the order of usury, crafts and real estate; thus, according to both the order of Luzzatto and of Morosini, Morosini should have written that the second and the third were prohibited, while only the first was permitted. More substantially, it is most sur- prising that Morosini did not utilize the opportunity to denounce usury, or at least make a reference to his treatment of that subject elsewhere in the Via dellajede (e.g., part III, chapter 15). 90.

Indeed hundreds of thousands did convert, as the most eloquent Osorius wrote.91 Morosini has of course already refuted these arguments, but nonetheless does so once more. See, he writes, how cunning Luzzatto was and how cautious not to offend the Christians; he tried to appear fully informed of what happened and of the true reasons for it but I have already explained why they were expelled from those places. The German crusaders, even though they did something in the Holy Land (presumably Morosini means slaughtered the Jews), only did it because they were annoyed by the very bad behavior of the Jews. In France, the reason for expelling the Templars was different; although it could be said that some kings had the political aim of 91. Morosini either distorted Luzzatto's presentation, whether deliberately or through a misunderstanding, or at least raised the possibility of misunderstanding on the part of his own readers by his formulation. Luzzatto's phrase "as this event is narrated in the History of the most eloquent Osorius" (consideration 17, fol. 88r, Hebrew translation, p. 151) apparently refers only to Emmanuel's promulgation of the decree of exile for all those Jews who would not convert and the complete confiscation of their goods, and not also to Luzzatto's preceding explanation of Emmanuel's action as resulting from his need for people to colonize the Indies. That reason was not found in Osorius (as Morosini points out below), who only stated that "it gave Emmanuel great uneasiness to think that so many thousand men should be driven into banishment, and he was desirous at least to bring over their sons." For the presentation of Osorius, see his De rebus Emmanueli libri duodecim (Lisbon, 1571), in English translation, The History of the Portuguese During the Reign of Emmanuel, 2 vols. (London, 1752), 1: 28-31. Osorius characterized Emmanuel's forced baptism as "a scheme which in fact was contrary to justice and equity," although he conceded that it had "good consequences." Of interest is Osorius's summary of the different views presented by Emmanuel's councel- lors as to whether the Jews should be expelled or not. Among the arguments in favor of keeping them was the fact that the pope allowed them to dwell in his territory (an argument used by Luzzatto, see above) and induced by his example, many Christian princes in Italy, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere in Europe allowed them to trade and carry on business of all sorts. Additionally, if they were to be expelled from Portugal, they would probably go to Africa, where, living among blind and superstitious Moslems, all hope of their conversion would be lost. Finally, "it would be greatly detrimental to the public interest if these people, some of whom were considerably rich, should carry their wealth to the Moors, and enrich our enemies with those arts which they learnt from our nation." This last argument is similar to that advanced by Sarpi to justify allowing Marranos to revert to Judaism in Venice; see Ravid, "The First Charter," pp. 210-11 and Economics and Toleration, pp. 35-36. On the other hand, among the arguments marshalled against the Jews was the consideration that it was in the pub- lic interest to expel the Jews immediately so that they would only take with them wealth they had gathered in other countries, rather than expelling them later after they had amassed con- siderable riches by fraudulent means in Portugal. For a similar discussion as to whether to tolerate the presence of Jews in Venice slightly over twenty years later, see Pullan, Rich and Poor in Renaissance Venice, pp. 489-96.</page><page sequence="46">346 BENJAMIN RAVID obtaining money, that did not preclude their having other reasons, just as someone who had sufficient reasons to kill someone else waits until notice is given of a reward. The people of Germany conceived a hatred of the Jews because of their reported and proven misdeeds and it suffices, he adds, to talk with a German to hear of many examples, also recent, of the evils the Jews commit in those countries, evils which are examined by the magistrates and punished severely by burning or by execution. The historical records, concludes Morosini on this point, deal with the misdeeds of the Moors and of the Jews in Spain, and if previous kings tolerated them, the zealous Ferdinand did not. Morosini notes that in 615 King Sisebut had expelled the Jews from Spain because they committed thousands of evils and wrote to the king of France to do the same, as had Heraclitus the Emperor, and this rendered the action of the king of Portugal at the request of the king of Spain very commendable, even though minors were baptised against the canon law. And Osorius in relating the fact (of the expulsions of the Jews from Portugal) did not write that the king did so to increase his population, but rather to save their souls, just as many are tolerated by the pope in the papal states so that they may save themselves.92 Morosini relates that in the fourth consideration Luzzatto had written that the Jews were abject, without a protector, and therefore prompt to obey, needy and cautious not to give offense to the populace of the place where they live lest they be expelled,93 while in the thirteenth and fourteenth he related that their laws oblige them to do good to all and that they have no prohibition against doing good unto other nations. O deceitful writer, exclaims Morosini, you ought to act peacefully and humbly, but it has been shown above how the opposite is the case so that holy popes, inclined to compassion, have been compelled to promulgate rigorous laws against you, as have at almost all times councils of bishops as well as general councils. Morosini will not, he continues, tell Luzzatto what the latter ought to do and that which Scripture teaches, because it is opposed to the Jews, for they follow the Talmud and other books which popes at different times have ordered to be burned because they contain the poison of maledictions against God, against Christ and against Christians, and even though it has been forbidden, the Jews continue to write more books. Morosini then cites many papal bulls denouncing the Talmud and related Jewish books and 92. See the previous note. 93. These exact words are not found in the fourth consideration, but the ideas in general are encountered in several passages in the Discorso.</page><page sequence="47">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 347 ordering them burned and destroyed because of their abominations and blasphemies. Luzzatto, Morosini asserts, cannot deny that which popes have affirmed repeatedly with bulls. When a bell rings at night, people run out of their houses, thinking that they are called either because of fire or of war, but some remain in bed because they do not believe that the evil is so great. But if the bell sounds again twice more and for many hours, almost everyone gets out of bed, correctly reasoning that the evil is very great and most obvious. Thus, if the Talmud and the other books had been banned once, many people might perhaps have believed that it happened on the basis of little information, but since popes at different times reiterated the same prohibition and ordered that it be burned, even the ignorant can con- clude that the Talmud is indeed dreadful and rightly detest it. And for this reason, claims Morosini, Luzzatto never mentioned the Talmud, because he knew how much it is held in abomination. In the place where he should have said something about it, he passed over it shrewdly, saying in the sixteenth consideration only that since God did not wish to make the Scriptures entirely clear, he expressed his will orally so that there would be no doubt regarding how to act, and that tradition was passed on.94 Morosini reminds his readers that he has dealt with this theme previously (p. 1131), never denying either the divine tradition or its necessity, but only that the im- pieties of the Talmud pass themselves off as the divine. In that same con- sideration, Morosini continues, Luzzatto had said that since the Jews in their miseries were not able to devote themselves to anything other than the study of the Sacred Scripture, they could consider themselves fortunate in this respect.95 But, counters Morosini, would to God that they would only study the Sacred Scriptures, which they consider to be the first object to study and almost for children. Their main object of study is the Talmud, 94. Discorso, consideration 16, fols. 75v-76r, Hebrew translation, p. 139. Morosini is slightly distorting Luzzatto's presentation. Luzzatto related that the rabbis said that in many places the Bible was so obtuse and concise that human knowledge could not penetrate its real sense, and since it was not believable that God should leave such uncertain interpretations to the free and hasty judgment of everyone, it was reasonable that he revealed the explanations to the most elect and close to him so that they could transmit it at all times to posterity. 95. Apparently this constitutes a distorted rendering of consideration 16, fols. 74v-75r, Hebrew translation, p. 138, where Luzzatto stated that the Jews, after the destruction of their kingdom and during their long and miserable dispersion, were about to sink into a total ignor- ance had not the need to understand the Bible which was full of secret teachings driven them to some moderate utilization of their intelligence and curiosity to know. See the remainder of his presentation there and also the closing lines of the consideration, fol. 85v, Hebrew translation, p. 148.</page><page sequence="48">348 BENJAMIN RAVID with which they occupy themselves with great joy. Although they give the impression that it is the exposition of the Scriptures, it is, on the contrary, the fancies of the rabbis, and therefore does not deserve to be enumerated among the ordinary books, but only among the impious, since it constitutes a source of curses and hate against Christianity. After a few paragraphs pointing out the hostile attitude of the Jews toward Christians and calling upon them to change their ways, in the closing lines of this chapter of Via della fede, Morosini reminds his readers that Luzzatto in the thirteenth consideration of the Discorso had written that Jewish law required the Jews to bear affection and do good to all nations.96 The Jews should honor Luzzatto and not reject him, and this would consti- tute a repudiation of the Talmud and the impious books of the Jews which instill hatred, and would be a reasonable action, in obedience to the divine commandment of the Decalogue: Thou shalt not kill. IV Palontrotti's Breve risposta and Morosini's Via dellafede may have been read with sympathetic agreement by contemporary Christians and with cri- tical rejection by contemporary Jews, but the impact of those works in the spheres of literature and of everyday political and legal life seems to have been virtually nonexistent. Both Palontrotti and Morosini failed to address themselves to the new element in Luzzatto: the economic considerations which were increasingly being accepted in Western Europe. While Luzzatto dealt with the present and anticipated the future, his two critics drew their arguments from the arsenal of previous polemics. Certainly in the case of Morosini and quite possibly also in the case of Palontrotti, the discussion of the Discorso was motivated by a desire to convert the Jews; accordingly a rational critique of the Discorso and its arguments in the context of seven- teenth-century Venice could scarcely be expected, although, as stated above, economic arguments against the Jews were on occasion advanced in seven- teenth-century Venice and it was as a reaction to them that Luzzatto formu- lated certain arguments in the first part of the Discorso. Palontrotti's Breve risposta, despite occasional valid criticisms of weaker apologetical argu- ments in the Discorso, was characterized by traditional religious anti-Jewish considerations, and subsequent generations relegated both it and its author 96. Discorso, consideration 13, fol. 46r-v, Hebrew translation, p. 113.</page><page sequence="49">CONTRA JUDAEOS IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 349 to complete obscurity. As stated above, nothing is known about its author, and no indication has come to light that the work itself was ever actually consulted by either contemporary polemicists, subsequent bibliographers or modern historians. Morosini and his Via dellafede are somewhat better known. As has been seen, Morosini revealed much about himself in his introductions, and some external information on him is extant. Also, subsequently the Italian rabbi Joshua Segre (ca. 1705-ca. 1797) included refutations of a few points in Via della fede in his own Hebrew polemic 'Asham talui,97 and Via della fede has been consulted by a handful of twentieth-century scholars.98 The book indeed deserves further attention and analysis for the information it con- tains on Jewish life and practices in seventeenth-century Italy. Yet Morosini's way of faith was clearly not the way of the Venetian government. Although the Jews of Venice were viewed with hostility and resentment for traditional religious reasons and because they were perceived in certain circles as economic competitors and exploiters, as well as out of political considerations since they were suspected of being spies for the Ottoman empire, the Venetian government maintained its policy of econo- mically motivated toleration. It renewed the charters of the Jewish mer- chants and moneylenders thoughout the seventeenth century. Subsequently, in the eighteenth century, the two sets of charters were combined into one and the presence and privileges of the Jews continued down to the end of the Republic.99 As the decades of the seventeenth century passed, it was not the spirit of the writings of Palontrotti and Morosini that was heeded elsewhere in Italy, and indeed in Western Europe, but rather that of Luzzatto, who, as Moro- sini briefly summarized, had stated that if the appeal to example would be valid in the variable realm of political life, then the Venetian policy of per- 97. See Samuel Krauss, "Joshua Segre und sein polemisches Werk," Zeitschrift far hebriaische Bibliographie 8 (1904): 20-27, and the rejoinder by David Simonsen, ibid., pp. 43-45. Segre's statement that Morosini converted at the age of 70 (accepted by Krauss but rejected by Simonsen on the basis of Morosini's introduction to Via dellafede [see above]) may be based on a misunderstanding of the fact that Morosini was between 70 and 72 when Via della fede was published in 1683 (on Morosini's date of birth, see above, note 68). See also Encyclo- paedia Judaica, s.v. "Morosini, Giulio," as well as "Segre, Joshua Ben Zion," where it is stated erroneously that in addition to 'Asham talui, "Segre also wrote a polemic against Giulio Moro- sini's Derekh ha-'emunah (La Via della Fede)." 98. See above, notes 57, 67 and 97. 99.

These developments led the Venetians in turn to renew their charter again in 1598, and subsequently in 1611, 1625 and 1636.o01 The Venetian situation then stimulated Luzzatto to write his Discorso (1638), and the Discorso in turn strongly influenced the Humble Addresses of Menasseh ben Israel (1655), written to secure the re- admission of the Jews into England.1'02 Meanwhile, a brief paragraph con- taining commercial considerations reminiscent of points made by Luzzatto and Menasseh ben Israel was included by the Jews of Amsterdam in their petition of 1655 to the directors of the West Indies Company to induce Peter Stuyvesant to allow the Dutch Jews who had fled Brazil to remain in New Amsterdam.'03 Then, similar justification was employed by the French government in the latter seventeenth century as the New Christians of the South began to emerge openly as Jews.104 While Palontrotti and Morosini represented the religiously motivated rejection pole of the traditional European ambivalence between religiously motivated rejection and economically motivated toleration, more and more of the states of Western and Central Europe began adopting an official legal policy of moving toward the opposite pole for reasons akin to those pro- posed by Luzzatto. Religious anti-Jewishness was by no means dead and humanitarian ideals of the natural rights of man were still in the future. Although the specific circumstances under which the Jews sojourned 100.
