Wolfson, Alef, Mem, Tau by Steven M. Wasserstrom Elliot R.Wolfson. Alef, Mem, Tau: Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006. xv, 327 pp. These "kabbalistic musings on time, truth, and death" originated as the Taubman Lectures delivered at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001.1 Wolfson summarizes them in his preface to Alef Mem, Tau (henceforth AMT): "The goal of my lectures was to illumine the nexus of time, truth, and death eli cited from the symbolic imaginary of the Jewish esoteric tradition known by both practitioners and scholars as kabbalah" (xi). Without attempting further to isolate an "argument," I can, at least, sketch for the potential reader some salient characteristics of these lectures. They are, first, hermeneutical, particularly as understood in the traditions of continental philosophy generally included under the rubric of hermeneutical 1. Aleph, Mem, Tau: Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006) may be read as the third part of a trilogy that includes Wolfson's Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination (New York: Fordham University Press, 2005) and Venturing Beyond: Law and Morality in Kabbalistic Mysticism (Oxford: Oxford Uni versity Press, 2006). It may be accurate to observe that not in the forty years since Jacques Derrida pub lished Writing and Difference, Speech and Phenomena, and Of Grammatology in one year (1967) have the humanities witnessed such a prodigious accomplishment in such a short space of time. A glance at these works encounters density and complexity on every page; they are, in other words, anything but churned out, or journalistic, or diffuse. Wolfson's project, interestingly, connects with Derrida both syn chronically and diachronically; his project traces through Derrida to a lineage of phenomenology leading from Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Like the tour de force of Derrida's 1967, it will take time to assess the full measure of Wolfson's trifecta. The rather staggering scale of Wolfson's recent work reminds me of something that Thomas Mann's narrator says of his protagonist: "Contem plating the mere manufacture of the work a steady-going man used to a moderate bourgeois rate of accomplishment might well go pale with terror" (Thomas Mann, Dr. Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkiihn as Told by a Friend, trans. H. T. Lowe-Porter [New York: Vintage, 1991], 358). 389</page><page sequence="2">Steven M. Wasserstrom phenomenology. Rather than practicing philology, history, or confessional theol ogy per se, AMT is philosophical, more precisely, phenomenological. Thus, if AMT has a methodology, it would be doubly a sefirotic phenomenology; a phe nomenology from the perspective of the sefirot and a phenomenology of the sefirot as its object of reflection. Second, these lectures are advanced, that is, not addressed to novices. Few readers, even those with some background in the sources, possess an adequate basis on which to critique the author's magisterial knowledge of kabbalistic sources, which knowledge, by universal assent, is exemplary. Its constitutive difficulty defies the mastery of most readers. Like the proverbial brain surgery or rocket science, kabbalistic mastery is recognized to be the domain of a few, one of whom is Elliot R. Wolfson. Third, they are not historical studies in Kabbalah?in fact, one chapter deals almost not at all with Kabbalah. Nor are they history-minded, even in the minimal sense of respecting the historical law of unrepeatability, the "non interchangable sequence of events." However, Wolfson's manifest practice in Alef Mem, Tau, in this regard, seems at times in tension with his stated theory. In certain respects, he is a historicist. For example, he does accept the thirteenth-century authorship of the Zohar.2 Such dates and dating, however, make few appearances.3 Fourth, these advanced, ahistorical lectures are composed, paradoxically, in an explicitly esoteric mode of address. Wolfson writes on esotericism with an explicit rhetorical heightening of the peculiar demands made on the reader by this "art of writing." He writes, it may fairly if paradoxically be said, much more explicitly esoterically than did Leo Strauss or Gershom Scholem. What Strauss asked of Scholem may be asked of Wolfson, whether he tried to "under stand the cabbalists better than they understood themselves."4 Fifth, they are linguocentric, centered on a certain experience of language. Wolfson's is a distinctive sense of linguistic time, in the sense that Yehuda Amichai attributes to the Hebrew language. "Time is entirely relative, relational. The phrase I like to use to describe my sense of time ... is comparative time. Time for me is imaginatively comparative and continuous."5 In Hebrew, unlike English or German or even the Latinate Romance languages, there aren't complex tense and mood structures ... you can change easily from present tense to past tense, or from present tense to future tense. There seems at times almost to be no difference and, as often 2.

This sense of bringing the past and future into the present defines my sense of time?it is very strong within me and my poetry.6 Amichai attributes to the very Hebrew language itself a supratemporality, a condition to which Wolfson seems peculiarly sensitive. Sixth, Wolfson's Kabbalistic phenomenology is not a philosophy of language, at least not as conventionally construed in the canon of analytic philos ophy. Alef Mem, Tau is, I think, closer to what Derrida invokes in his lecture on Paul Celan: "Philosophy finds itself, finds itself again in the vicinity of poetics, indeed, of literature ... stripped of what one must call the philosophical experi ence: a certain questioning traversal of limits, uncertainty as to the border of the philosophical field?and above all the experience of language, always just as poetic, or literary, as it is philosophical."7 Seventh, they are paradoxical. Following his kabbalistic masters, Wolfson often employs the form "not-this-but-not-that," as in Alef, Mem, Tau's "time-that-is-no-time" (94), "et lo et" (75), qadmon beli qadmut (75) may be distinguished from mere ambivalence. The frequent use of paradox makes understanding Alef, Mem, Tau yet that much more difficult. Eighth, these lectures are admittedly and unabashedly contemplative and poetical. AMT seems to transcribe a kind of scholarly contemplation in the act of contemplating. Given the risks, one might ask, toward what end? The answer to that entirely appropriate question, not fully forthcoming from a reading of this volume alone, is, for better or worse, contemplation itself. Wolfson identifies the ladder of prayer with scala contemplativa (95). And he has written at length on contemplation elsewhere. In other words, Alef, Mem, Tau claims to carry its own justification. Ninth, while they are intensely contemplative, they are not autobiographical. Tenth, AMT is silent on the "theologico-political predicament." It explicitly dismisses politics, though not out of some ideologically reactionary dismissal of contemporary political action.8 Celan, the author of epigraphs attached to three of AMTs chapters, refuted just such a misapprehension of his own work. "True ... it sounds at first like allegiance to the ancien r?gime. But ... this is not homage to any monarchy, to any yesterday worth preserving. It is homage to the majesty of the absurd which bespeaks the presence of human beings."9 *** The autobiographical never explicitly enters AMT.

Of Wolfson's Heideggerian predecessors, Alexander Altmann, however, is not so prominently cited.10 This lacuna is striking, given that the mode of herme neutical practice undertaken by Wolfson is closer to Altmann and Corbin? perhaps because Wolfson, as they do, employs the procedures and operations of the history of religions?than it is to Rosenzweig or Heidegger. On the one hand, Wolfson does explicitly "embrace philology as a legitimate means for recon structing historical meaning and thereby situating a text in its proper literary context."11 On the other hand, he speaks of "my own imaginai thinking," which positions his writing practice closer to Corbin than to Altmann.12 Alexander Altmann (1906-87) was Wolfson's teacher in Kabbalah at Brandeis University. Altmann?whose students, in addition to Wolfson, include Kabbalah scholars Arthur Green, Lawrence Fine, and Daniel Matt?almost single-handedly engendered the academic study of Kabbalah in North America. It is perhaps more than coincidence that, in addition to training in advanced Kabbalah studies, Wolfson also came to share a serious interest in Heidegger with this teacher. While still a young rabbi in Germany, Altmann was profoundly affected by Heidegger's teaching and devoted several piercing pages to him in 1930.13 At the end of his long life, after many years of scholarly reserve, Altmann wrote a final piece of philosophy. His thinking, it turned out, remained markedly Heideggerian.14 This was his last word, in more than one sense. With regard to the study of Kabbalah in general, and in order to understand the volume under review in particular, it is worth stressing, then, that Wolfson emerged under the tutelage of Altmann. Along with Shlomo Pines in Israel and Georges Vajda in France, Altmann wrote broadly and deeply on mysticism and philosophy as those traditions developed both from Europe and the Muslim East. To be sure, Gershom Scholem achieved far greater international influence than any of these three, but in their respective mastery both of Arabic and of phil osophy each was greater than Scholem. Wolfson, in short, comes out of this non-Scholem subtradition in Kabbalah studies. The conclusion of AMT reveals Wolfson to be a true student of Altmann in at least one other, profound sense. Altmann 's influential reading of "Franz Rosenzweig on History" is that of Jews "beyond history." "Rosenzweig holds that it is the task of the Jew to sacrifice life in the world for the purpose of 10.

Whoever is truly and inwardly one with his Jewish existence, whoever feels born into truly and inwardly one with his Jewish existence, whoever feels born into the supratemporal phenomenon of Jewish reality in all its concrete greatness and knows that here lies the main thrust of his psychic and spiritual existence [knows] that our Jewish reality takes place in different dimensions and is decided on a different level than on the cutting edge that represents the point of today.18 Wolfson ends AMT on much the same point?a point made by Altmann in the all too-temporal year of 1933.19 *** In his 1936 lecture "Freud and the Future," Thomas Mann embraced Sigmund Freud as a "man and gallant knight, a knight between Death and the Devil, I have been used to picture myself our psychologist of the unconscious, ever since his figure first swam into my mental ken."20 Here Mann seemed to identify Freud with Albrecht D?rer 's 1513 engraving The Knight, Death, and the Devil, thus rather weirdly making a self-professed "godless Jew" into the archetypal Knight of Christ. However, as if he was adducing a screen memory, Mann simultaneously but silently evoked a second engraving by D?rer. Mann's observation on the aged, sick, harassed master of the science of melancholy sim ultaneously suggested another of D?rer 's three "Master Engravings" made in 1513-14, that is, Melencholia I. In 1938, the exiled art historian Erwin Panofsky?another distinguished member of the ?migr? cohort that included Altmann and Scholem?delivered his authoritative lectures on D?rer.21 Panofsky and his colleagues then constructed a massive edifice on this basis?their 15.

Wasserstrom monumental Saturn and Melancholy. However well-meant was Mann's compli ment, these saturnine studies suggest that Freud was more appropriately portrayed in Melencholia I than in The Knight, Death, and the Devil. Wolfson is no Knight of Christ, needless to say. But, as was the case with Freud's psychoanalytic writing, melancholy suffuses AMT unsharably, like a rapture after midnight. A melancholic jouissance, to use Wolfson's favorite device, the oxymoron, or, more precisely, the ecstatic paradox, rules AMT; stretched between melancholia and jouissance, between micrological detailings of sefirot and death itself, AMT seeks, with the ambition of a Freud, nothing less than a retrievable path from the traumatic past into a powerfully private yet publically lucid now. *** I suspect that few readers can conscientiously follow Wolfson into these realms beyond our capacity to understand, much less to communicate. There was a time when initiation, of one sort or the other, authorized access to such realms. AMT might be read, in fact, as a melancholic form of mourning for the death of initiatory authorization. In terms of sheer scholarship, we have in AMT something rare and strange, monumentally accomplished learning produced impeccably?one thinks of the precision and the amplitude of Saturn and Melancholy?but crafted, it would seem, to be inaccessible to almost all readers. Panofsky once declined to interpret the symbolism of Hieronymus Bosch by wittily citing the old lines, "This, too high for my wit, I prefer to omit."23 It seems only proper for any cautious scholar that some things must be left "too high for my wit." The melancholic jouissance of the Zohar might seem to fit precisely into just such a category. While Wolfson does not "prefer to omit," his work may be, for some readers, "too high for my wit." In this sense, he follows not Panofsky but Scholem in entering realms so notoriously dangerous to the mere scholar ?"How can one speak of a history of the private realm or of those things that are between man and his Creator?! Yes, nevertheless, there certainly is! The entire history of religions is built upon the development of those impulses."24 The decisive question, of course, is who is competent to judge.25 The only question of importance, of course, is the question whether Heideg ger's teaching is true or not. But the very question is deceptive because it is silent about the question of competence?of who is competent to judge. Perhaps only the great thinkers are really competent to judge of the thought 22.

Can we agree with Wolfson, for example, that gender is the master trope of Kabbalah? I myself am not qualified to judge?nor, I expect, can any but a few readers. 394</page><page sequence="7">Melancholy Jouissance and the Study of Kabbalah of great thinkers. Heidegger made a distinction between philosophers and those for whom philosophy is identical with the history of philosophy. He made a distinction, in other words, between the thinker and the scholar. I know that I am only a scholar.26 Wolfson, of course, is a scholar. But Strauss's query regarding Heidegger may be asked of Wolfson, too?is he only a scholar? For whom is AMT written?and who is capable of reading it properly? To come full circle, the answer, for better or worse, must be tautological. Those who can will compose its readership. Whoever can or cannot appreciate it, the present reviewer, for one, receives it, alongside its counterparts in Wolfson's corpus, as an act of phenomenological con templation. This reading makes sense for Wolfson, in the "first" place, because the Kabbalah was, according to Wolfson, itself a phenomenology of Torah. AMT is an imaginai phenomenology; Wolfson borrows that term from the Islamicist Henry Corbin, whom he greatly admires. The "imaginai body" that it contemplates is gendered, and thus AMT, and its larger corpus of Wolfson's recent work, can be read as a performative contemplation of the gender character of Existenz. Something of the sort was said of the late Richard Rorty, that "he is a man of metaphysical insight who then uses the result as an object for phenomen ological examination."27 In other words, he does not study such a phenomenology, he performs it. In a sense, this performance, ecstatic and melancholic as it is, potentiates, or seeks to potentiate, an experience of present time, of a certain sort of now. In The Principle of Hope, Ernst Bloch invokes Fausf's fulfilled moment, when "the clock stands still."28 In Bloch's estimation, "the perfect moment remains the fundamen tal problem of the Faust-subject."29 The fundamental problem of Wolfson's phe nomenological play, so to speak, can be found in the immediacy of the reader's engagement with it, an engagement not without its perils: "the moment of ecstasy, et la'asot la-yhwh, is a two-edged sword, herevpifiyyot (Ps. 149:6), not only in the sense that the instant breaks into time in such a manner that it is severed from 'before' and 'after'... but also in the sense that it has the potential to sever one's connection to the path" {AMT, 102). 26.

Wasserstrom A philologically gifted Kabbalah scholar could be occupying himself profit ably with critical editions or revisionary histories. But Wolfson is also a published poet and active painter, and now, with the recent books that include AMT, he stands before us as a full-blown postmodern Jewish philosopher.30 He follows the perfor mative practices of continental philosophy descending from Heidegger. This is a professorial philosophizing that performs in the apparatus of footnotes, etymology, and the like. Its predecessor, German philological expressionism, similarly flouted the lines separating poetry, philosophy, and philology. AMT, to be sure, by any reckoning, is an academic book. But like these predecessors, it is also not only academic. *** To characterize AMT as a poem might understandably seem to denigrate it in the eyes of some scholars. Nevertheless, if it is a poem, it is a poem whose objec tive correlative is Kabbalah; it is a speculative poem dedicated to the sefirot as its object for phenomenological examination; it is a poem perching zoharic arcana upon the (strangely apt) scaffolding of philology in order to reach (and return with something significantly sayable about) time, truth, and death. In conclusion, the reader can see that the reviewer has had difficulties with the significant difficulties of AMT However, the conclusion for this reviewer, to be perfectly clear, is unequivocal: It is worth the effort. Thomas Carry le's half-ironic words on his imaginary German philosopher's big book apply un-ironically to Wolfson and his Alefi Mem, Tau, too: If for a speculative man, "whose seedfield," in the sublime words of the Poet, "is Time," no conquest is important but that of new ideas... . It is indeed an "extensive Volume," of boundless, almost formless contents, a very Sea of Thought; neither calm nor clear, if you will; yet wherein the toughest pearl diver may dive to his utmost depth, and return not only with sea-wreck but with true orients.31 Steven M.
