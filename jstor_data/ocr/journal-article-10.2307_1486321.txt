<plain_text><page sequence="1">RABBINICAL STATUS AND RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY IN IMPERIAL GERMANY: THE GERMAN RABBINICAL ASSOCIATION by STEPHEN M. POPPEL The old political adage that every people gets the leaders it deserves may be recast in a broader, more positive, and ultimately truer sense to state that every society seeks (though it does not necessarily find) the kind of leader- ship that best embodies its values and aspirations. Thus much can be learned about a society by examining the relative standing of competing claimants for its leadership. This is particularly so in the wake of great transitions, when such standing may be expected to reflect specific intention, rather than the social inertia that predominates in calmer times. These considerations apply with special force to late-nineteenth-century German Jewry, which was just completing the transformation, launched by the Haskalah, from a traditional, culturally autonomous society to a present-oriented and acculturated one. Though at first glance its institu- tions of leadership seem stable throughout the period, in fact they developed in ways that reveal much about the underlying directions of change and the nature of the transition that occurred. Particularly telling was the conflict over the appropriate role of the rabbi, who sought a position as an in- 185</page><page sequence="2">186 STEPHEN M. POPPEL dependent religious leader offering authoritative professional guidance for the spiritual affairs of the community, but who was in danger of being reduced by the actions of governing boards to a religious figurehead, able only to ratify the inclinations of an increasingly acculturated and secularized Jewry. The primary locus of nineteenth-century German Jewish community life was the organized, legally chartered community-the Gemeinde. Typically the Gemeinde comprised the Jews of a particular locality, though in some jurisdictions-such as Baden-the separate Gemeinden might be linked together in a larger, formal network with a certain amount of central control and direction. The fact that these communities were sanctioned, and to some extent regulated, by civil law represents a continuation of premodern political structures, whereby society was composed in the first instance of collective "estates," or of corporations such as towns and guilds, rather than of individual citizens subject to a unified, centralized state.' The constituted authority of the Jewish community resided in a govern- ing board, which might range from three to twenty-one or more members, depending on the community's size. Often these boards were formally repre- sentative of the community in that they were chosen by some direct or indirect electoral procedure, though votes were usually heavily weighted in proportion to the elector's contribution-to the tax rolls. Therefore in prac- tice communities tended to be ruled by oligarchies of their wealthier members, with much continuity of successive generations of particular families. More democratic notions of community governance began to prevail only in the twentieth century.2 Wealth was regarded not so much as a license for privilege as a writ of responsibility, and wealthier members of a 1.

Generally, however, a board's main concern was the more mundane business of government involved in maintaining an extensive system of religious, educational, and social welfare institutions with their associated rabbis, teachers, and officials. It may have been the very mass and gravity of the board's obligations that stabilized its own existence. The most dramatic shift in the leadership of the nineteenth-century Jewish community was registered not by its nominal governing bodies, but rather by its religious leadership, the rabbinate. The nature of the rabbinic office was much affected by the transformation of German Jewry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Jews compartmentalized their activities and even their consciousness, and restricted the realms in which Judaism held sway. They reshaped their Jewishness to make it less ethnic and more a matter of religion and to make that religion more rational and less tradi- tional. They regarded their surrounding culture with a new, positive appre- ciation and made many of its values and achievements their own. One important consequence was a diminished concern for, and observance of, traditional Jewish law-certainly in its civil aspects, and increasingly in its 3. One perhaps extreme example is provided by the case of Samuel Israel, who in 1855 refused nomination to the Hamburg community board for reasons of political principle: he regarded the continued existence of the Gemeinde as a political anachronism, and condemned the procedures for selecting the board as undemocratic. It may have been because of Israel's principled and, from the board's viewpoint, dangerous stance that the board pursued him with special vigor. In the face of Israel's obdurate refusal to serve, the board imposed a fine of 3,000 marks, to be paid to the community's poor chest. This sum was later reduced by the Hamburg Senate to 1,000 marks. In most of the other Hamburg cases that I examined, where a nominee attempted to decline serving for claimed reasons of health, the board generally accepted the excuse without demurrer, or sometimes successfully insisted that the nominee serve anyway. However, at least one serious stalemate developed in 1832 and 1833 in the case of Lipmann Raphael Beit, a member of a prominent Hamburg family. Citing reasons of health, Beit declined to serve, but the board pursued him for over a year, despite Beit's securing a physician's attestation of his supposed inability to withstand the strains of board membership. In the end Beit was forced to appeal to the Hamburg Senate and finally secured his release, evidently without having to pay any fine. The records of these cases may be found in the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People (hereafter, CAHJP) in the Hamburg board minutes, AHU 273a/Bd. 5 and 11, and the associated documents in AHU 274/a-c.</page><page sequence="4">188 STEPHEN M. POPPEL ritual religious ones. In these circumstances the rabbi faced a decline in the demand for his established product, traditional talmudic expertise. The challenge was really twofold. On the one hand, Jews whose social attach- ments and cultural involvements were directed ever more toward their German surroundings regarded Judaism with increasing indifference. On the other hand, some Jews hoped that by altering Judaism they might shape a reformed religion that would merit and retain their own and others' continued devotion. To maintain his position the rabbi had to cast himself in a new role that would attract and serve both groups.4 It would be mistaken, however, to imagine the rabbinate standing uni- fied on the ground of tradition, and only exceptionally and grudgingly contemplating demands for change-either the explicit demands of reli- gious reformers or the implied challenges of the indifferent. Even among rabbis in service early in the nineteenth century it was possible to find indivi- duals who were alert to the new situation and able to respond positively. Thus when the Hamburg community board decided in 1820 to seek a rabbi able both to perform traditional functions and to restore the allegiance of the indifferent through such relative innovations as vernacular preaching, it was able to identify several appropriate candidates beside Isaac Bernays, whom it eventually hired.5 Similarly, in its selection of Abraham Geiger as rabbi in 1838, the Breslau board was able to appoint a Reform advocate of considerable stature. Of greater numerical and long-range significance was the rise of a new, younger generation of rabbis, whose own outlook was affected by the same currents of rationalism and acculturation that influenced German Jewry generally. The collective appearance of these rabbinic advocates of Reform in the rabbinical assemblies of 1844-1846 was only a visible manifestation of their growing presence.6 Thus the new rabbinate was a product both of communal expectations and of its own orientations. The increasing tendency of rabbis to secure at least some secular university education in addition to traditional talmudic education is 4. This is the classic plight of leadership, as was once aptly captured, though in admittedly wholly different circumstances, by Mahatma Gandhi, who is reported to have said, "There go my people. I must hurry to catch them, for I am their leader." 5. For details see Stephen Poppel, "The Politics of Religious Leadership: The Rabbinate in Nineteenth-Century Hamburg," LBIYB 28 (1983): 439-70. 6.

Admittedly none of these activities by itself was an innovation. The vernacular sermon, as Zunz demonstrated, had long been an element in Jewish spiritual life. But at least in the immediate premodern period it had not been the prime responsibility of the community rabbi, whose contract typically called for such an address only twice a year. Now the spiritually elevating sermon was set at the focus of the synagogue service.8 Similarly the rabbi had always been a teacher, but primarily of advanced talmudic students. With the eroding regard for the Talmud as a comprehensive and all-sufficing vehicle of Jewishness, the rabbi turned his attention increasingly to secondary and even elementary Jewish education, which formerly were the preserves of lesser functionaries, but which now had to bear the prime responsibility for Jewish cultural transmission. Like- wise the rabbi might have filled a pastoral role in the past, but only inciden- tally, as an especially eminent and visible member of the community. Taken together these functional transformations of the rabbinic office served to preserve it by fitting it to the emergent realities and needs of a new Judaism and a changed Jewry. Successful evolution brings with it, however, the challenge of new environments and new competitors. The eroded position that the rabbinate abandoned had been in its time a protected preserve. But the new circum- stances to which the rabbinate successfully responded also generated a new set of claimants for Jews' attentions. Foremost among these, of course, were non-Jewish culture and society, whose attractions and values Jews increas- ingly admired and appropriated. But even within the nominally Jewish realm the rabbi faced significant competitors. For example, the rabbi was not alone in undertaking to formulate and deliver elevating and inspiring sermons; indeed there was little in his training that specifically equipped him 7.

In many communities, and especially in reformed religious circles, a preacher (Prediger) might be appointed to this task. Generally, primary and secondary schools were already in the hands of well-established teachers. In fact, since preachers and teachers alike might be as learned in Talmud and proficient in ritual as the rabbi, they challenged the rabbi's position not only in his newly claimed functions, but also by competing for the emoluments that a rabbi might expect for the performance of occasional rituals. In smaller communities several Judaic offices might be telescoped together, with the same individual serving variously as preacher, cantor, teacher, ritual slaughterer, or circumciser-and dependent on the collective income from all for his livelihood. Apart from these ritual realms there was also a growing secular domain within the Jewish sphere whose very existence detracted from the rabbi's influence. The secular, "scientific" study of Judaism, Wissenschaft des Judentums, involved examining its subject from an external, critical vantage. While this was not necessarily corrosive of continued Jewish allegiance, and in fact might confirm established Jewish loyalties on new foundations, it did introduce an additional voice that could speak of Jewish tradition with its own authority. For the traditional rabbi Wissenchaft des Judentums almost inevitably represented a countervailing authority, while for the Reform rabbi it was at least an alternative one that detracted from the distinctive expert status of the rabbi's office and person, even though it may have reinforced the substance of the Reform position. On a popular level Jewish learning was secularized in a way that did not so much detract from the rabbi's special standing as remove it from his special competence altogether. Whereas in the past small, more or less in- formal groups might gather for the study of Talmud either as an indepen- dent activity or as part of a fraternal, philanthropic, or mutual-benefit association, now such gatherings for popular study were more likely to take the form of local associations for Jewish history and literature. Gustav Karpeles, who organized a national organization of these local associations, made the point explicitly by describing the literary association as a surrogate for the traditional house of study.9 Rabbis might try to capitalize on this 9. Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums (hereafter, AZJ) 59, no. 47 (Nov. 22, 1895): 553. Karpeles founded the Verband der Vereine fiirjiidische Geschichte und Literatur in 1893. At its pre-World War I peak the Verband included almost 230 local associations. It published the important Jahrbuch far jadische Geschichte und Literatur.

As important as these developments were, the single most significant challenge to the rabbi, directed specifically against his claim to a special authority based on his religious expertise, came from his employers, the community governing boards. Although there definitely were new elements in the tension between rabbi and board, it would be wrong to overestimate the novelty of the situation. In the first place, the fact that in the premodern community the rabbi had no monopoly over "rabbinic" lore meant that his judgments might be energetically challenged by members of the community who had no official status but nonetheless were knowledgeable. Moreover, since the rabbi was primarily a judicial officer, he depended on the com- munity's political authority, i.e., the board, for the execution of his judg- ments. This was true especially of the rabbi's ultimate sanction of excommunication, which not only depended in practice on the consent and cooperation of the board and the community, but in some localities was made explicitly conditional on the board's prior agreement. This constraint reflected the intrinsic divergence between the rabbi's judicial function and the board's administrative responsibilities. The rabbi might speak with the voice of tradition, but the board represented the governing community consensus. Presumably it was characteristic of the premodern period that, despite occasional conflict, there was considerable continuity between these two outlooks. But with the subsequent decline in the traditional consensus the potential for conflict came to the fore. Community members and their governing boards were no longer universally rooted in tradition, and they did not necessarily recognize that the rabbi's distinctive expertise lent his judgments any special authority. The new rabbi presented himself to the community as its spiritual leader, and the community nominally accepted him as such, though without con- ceding the authority that such leadership would seem to have required. A board could allow the rabbi a role of independent spiritual leadership only as long as he kept pace with the community, and only as long as he did not 10. The astonishing remark was made by the liberal rabbi Heinemann Vogelstein in one of the opening speeches at a convention of representatives of the Verband in 1897.

With this in mind a board might explicitly oblige its rabbi to refrain from divisive speech or action, or even subject his sermons to its censorship. The paradox was that the rabbi was expected to offer guidance in the name of a tradition whose authority was no longer unconditionally and universally accepted. In these circumstances the community's ambivalence became the rabbi's dilemma. II The formation of a German Rabbinical Association" in 1884 repre- sented, among other things, an effort to give the rabbinate a collective presence and voice in order to compensate for the generally weak political standing that the individual rabbi had in his local community. The ultimate failure of the undertaking indicates the strength of the opposition. It also reveals much about the rabbis' and community leaders' visions of them- selves and each other, and about the contours and condition of Judaism in Imperial Germany. The General Assembly of Rabbis in Germany that gathered in Berlin at the beginning of June 1884 was not the first meeting of German rabbis to discuss their collective concerns. Previous occasions, however, such as the conferences of the mid-1840s, the gathering in Cassel in 1868, and the "synods" at Leipzig in 1869 and Augsburg in 1871, had mostly addressed issues of religious reform, and hence implicitly excluded anyone unsym- pathetic to the Reform party. The innovation in 1884 was the attempt to gather the entire German rabbinate in a single organization, regardless of divergent religious convictions, and to draw its attention to a broader complex of problems. Thus the invitation that members of the Berlin rabbinate issued for the 1884 meeting promised that "every point of religious controversy" would be "excluded from the discussion."" The assembly observed this constraint but 11. Rabbiner-Verband in Deutschland. After its reorganization in 1896 the organization was also known as the Allgemeiner Rabbiner-Verband. 12.

Hence the agenda called for a public declaration of Judaism's position on interfaith relations; a discussion of means for raising Jewish religious consciousness and improving religious education; and the foundation of a German rabbinical association. In each regard the assembly produced the anticipated resolutions-affirming Jews' love of their fellow men (i.e., denying that Jews applied any lesser morality in their relations with Christians than in their dealings with Jews); elaborating a range of educational and curricular reforms; and confirming a detailed charter for the projected rabbinical association. The charter's preamble outlined the whole range of concerns that the meeting had addressed, and it stressed the new association's commitment to antidefamation and to Jewish cultural and religious development and educa- tion. However, it also made no secret of the association's concern for the rabbinate itself, and its intention to "safeguard the dignity and prestige of the rabbinical profession."'3 To be sure, the apparent self-interest was justi- fied in altruistic terms, by linking the spiritual health of German Judaism with an active, strong, and well-organized rabbinate. Nevertheless, as the debates of subsequent decades were to demonstrate, the rabbinate's confi- dence in its own central importance was by no means universally shared. Creating an organization requires more than brave resolutions and detailed charters,14 as the early years of the German Rabbinical Association confirmed. In at least one regard the organization was a failure from the outset, since despite its promise to exclude issues of religious dispute it was generally boycotted by traditionalists.'5 The organization seemed unsuccess- ful on other grounds as well, and after two years, when the association had failed to meet for a second time in the biannual general assembly that its bylaws required, the executive committee was forced to admit that little of practical value had been achieved. The explanations that were offered for this failure to reconvene, while perhaps exaggerated, reveal something of the actual working conditions of 13. Statut, sec. 1.

Summer vacation was one time that most rabbis would be free for a convention, but this period they preferred to reserve for recovering from the labors of the year, and for "strengthening or recovering their health." More revealing was the fact that many rabbis claimed that they simply could not afford the expense of traveling to a national conven- tion.'6 That this was not simply an empty excuse is underlined by the public acknowledgement at subsequent meetings of contributions made to cover the travel expenses of attendees.'7 When in 1914 a member of the executive committee proposed that rabbis forgo the customary subventions from their communities lest their independence of judgment and expression be com- promised, he was roundly opposed on the grounds that many of his col- leagues could not afford to attend the general assemblies without them.'" (Members of the executive committee were in any case reimbursed from the association's treasury for travel costs to their regular meetings.)'9 Whatever the reasons, there was little visible activity in these early years, and the association's 1886 report could only insist that the organization was "by no means as dead as might appear." In the absence of concrete achieve- ments the executive committee insisted that the mere fact of the association's existence brought benefits of its own, since it created or strengthened the individual rabbi's consciousness of belonging to a larger professional group whose very organization would benefit the collectivity and thereby the individual.20 There was a considerable gap between this hearty rhetoric and the reality of the group's weakness, as at least one venture revealed. Kosher slaughter- ing was a favorite target of anti-Semites, who attacked it under the guise of preventing cruelty to animals and attempted, sometimes successfully, to secure restrictive legislation. In 1886 the association's executive tried to address this problem but soon decided that since the rabbinate in Prussia lacked any legal standing as clerics, it would do better to turn over the 16.

The original Rabbinical Association succeeded in holding only one other general assembly, in Breslau in 1887, before its reorganization in 1896.22 As in 1884, it met under the watchword of the exclusion of points of religious contention. Indeed the very possibility of doing so formed one theme of the opening address by Manuel Joel, formerly a member of the faculty of the middle-of-the-road Breslau Jewish Theological Seminary. Joel applauded the appearance of a new, university-trained rabbinate, whose common outlook transcended the old tensions between progressive and conservative commitments that animated the Reform disputes of mid-century. The issues that had exercised the Reform conferences of the 1840s were now resolved, or had at least been thoroughly aired, and could be laid aside. Despite Joel's confidence, the exclusion of religious controversy from the association's deliberations must have cramped them considerably, and was increasingly felt to be an undesirable constraint. Even before the 1884 founding assembly had actually convened, Ludwig Philippson-the in- fluential editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, who had played an important role in organizing the previous rabbinical conferences-doubted that the exclusion would be viable. He observed that "even the discussion of religious education cannot avoid touching on 'points of controversy' unless it remains superficial and excessively limited to general questions."23 Eventually, in 1889 the executive committee proposed amending the asso- ciation's bylaws to allow for the introduction of religiously controversial matters on the agenda of general assemblies, though only with its own prior approval. The issue seemed inescapable, and arose again the next year in connection with a plan for the association to publish a Passover Haggadah, a project that would necessarily involve substantive points of religious dispute.24 Although the original Rabbinical Association recognized the problem, it 21.

POPPEL never really resolved it, and its failure to do so was apparently an important reason for its almost complete dormancy, apart from executive committee meetings, after the 1887 convention in Breslau. If the rabbinate were to gather to foster religious and cultural matters in general, as the Rabbinical Association claimed it had, it could not easily refuse to address issues of substance, which inevitably would prove to be controversial. The lesson of the original Rabbinical Association was that the political unification on these grounds of a religiously divided rabbinate was unlikely. There was, however, another possibility, which had been indicated by the third part of the association's program, namely, the rabbinate's pursuit of its own inter- ests as a professional class. In this case it was the fact of political unification itself that counted, while religious diversity could be easily overlooked. Such an approach was more than a theoretical possibility, and it in fact provided the basis for the reorganization of the Rabbinical Association that was undertaken in 1896. III The December 1896 broadside that called for the reactivation of the Rabbinical Association was sober in its analysis of the organization's failures. "An Association of rabbis that refuses to consider religious matters is an absurdity [Unding]." Because of the comprehensiveness of Jewish reli- gious law, the expectation that it could be bypassed had proved incorrect. Collective action was possible only if rabbis could deal calmly and objective- ly with religious matters about which they were not necessarily unanimous. The old association, the broadside conceded, was from its very beginning a partisan group from which a considerable proportion of the German rabbinate held itself distant.25 To remedy this one-sidedness the new organizing committee did more than urge a coalition on behalf of common interests; it actually formed one itself. The invitation to its meeting at the end of December was signed by the liberal Berlin rabbi Sigmund Maybaum, but also included the names of such leading traditionalists as Azriel Hildesheimer of Berlin and Markus Horowitz of Frankfurt. Interestingly the immediate issue that had proved powerful enough to occasion a coalition across lines of religious dispute was 25. CAHJP: M4/1.</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY IN IMPERIAL GERMANY 197 the already familiar one of Jewish religious ethics, particularly the matter of kosher slaughtering, which anti-Semites continued to denounce as in- humane. By the time the old association addressed this issue, the organiza- tion had already been clearly marked as a religiously liberal group. The challenge to kosher slaughtering, however, was one that directly affected traditionalists' interests at the same time that it defamed Judaism generally. Therefore, it could serve as the object of collective rabbinical attention, and as the point of departure for a new, comprehensive rabbinical association. The strategy proved to be effective, and the 1896 convention succeeded in reactivating the Rabbinical Association on the basis of a slightly modified constitution that allowed for the discussion of religious questions as long as the positions established by recognized traditional authorities were not challenged.26 Thus in its general assembly held a year and a half later, in June 1898, the association was able to take up a whole range of issues touch- ing on religious practice (the introduction of a sermon at Friday evening services, the relationship between Jewish law and veterinary science), reli- gious education, Zionism (particularly the executive committee's 1897 denunciation of Zionism, which the assembly ratified), and group life insurance. In terms of sheer bulk of attention, however, the matter that most occupied the congress was the status of the rabbinate. The resolutions that it produced provided the agenda for the rabbinate's political activity within the Gemeinden for at least the ensuing decade. Basically the resolutions bore on the often related issues of the rabbi's religious authority and his job security.27 The first resolution demanded that 26. Section 16: "In den Sitzungen des Vorstandes und Ausschusses, sowie in den General- versammlungen des Verbandes diirfen nur solche religi6se Fragen er6rtert werden, die keinen Verstoss gegen die religionsgesetzlichen Bestimmungen der massgebenden Decisoren in sich schliessen." Satzungen des Rabbiner-Verbandes in Deutschland (rev. 1896). The coalition was fostered by the fact that matters of more specifically partisan interest could be handled by separate organizations that were founded shortly thereafter: the Vereini- gung traditionell-gesetzestreuer Rabbiner, in 1897, and the Vereiningung der liberalen Rab- biner Deutschlands, in 1898. In 1906 a separatist orthodox group (Verband der orthodoxen Rabbiner) was established, whose members did not join the general Rabbinical Association. 27.

POPPEL the rabbi be included in governing boards' discussions of religious matters, and required that any alteration in existing religious arrangements be made only with the agreement both of the rabbi and of the board (the so-called veto right). The formulation clearly anticipated that the rabbi would serve as a brake on perhaps hasty and ill-conceived change. More revealing than the call for a rabbinic veto was the very need to demand that the rabbi be included in religious deliberations, for the rabbinate was finding it increas- ingly difficult to have its views seriously regarded, or even to make its voice heard, on religious matters. The problem was especially severe in the many cases where the rabbi was not the master in his own house, but where religious affairs and synagogue arrangements were under the control of the governing board.28 In these circumstances the rabbinate undertook to cast itself in a special role that would justify its claim to a decisive voice in religious affairs. Unlike the Catholic priest, however, the rabbi had no distinctive sacerdotal powers that would set him apart from the laity. In fact, given the generality of talmudic learning in the traditional community, and Judaism's provision for a direct, unmediated relationship between God and the individual, the con- trast between clergy and laity would have been foreign to premodern Jewry. During the course of the nineteenth century, however, the rabbi's expertise had become more and more unusual, and increasingly provided the basis for his claim to a special position as a professional representative of Judaism vis-A-vis his less-educated co-religionists. In this light someone who was not a rabbi could be seen as a "layman" in the modern sense of the term, that is as someone who is not a member of a particular profession.29 The rabbi who introduced the resolution on rabbinical authority drew the analogy explicitly when he insisted that the desire for formal rabbinical influence in religious matters was not a hunger for personal power, but was die Bitte zu richten, in Ausnahmefillen auch solche Kandidaten zuzulassen, welche sich ander- weitig die erforderlichen Kenntnisse erworben haben und als wiirdig fuir den Beruf befunden werden.

In the same vein a later speaker con- ceded that while rabbis were not specially ordained priests in the Catholic sense, they were clerics (Geistliche) "in the word's holiest and truest mean- ing," since they "represented the spiritual [geistige] interests of Judaism and exercised a decisive influence." "We are," he insisted, "the teachers of the communities and as such ought to occupy a befitting position."30 The critical listener might have detected a circularity in this argument, which could be reduced to the claim that since the rabbi had a special authority he ought to have a special authority. What was missing, and what was required to make the argument more than tautological, was a demon- stration that the rabbi had a special vantage that mattered to others, and that his view would be sought with the same interest as that of the legal or medical specialist in his particular realm. Given the relative weakness of the rabbi's prqfessional authority, his security in office depended on institutional arrangements that were generally dictated by the very lay boards with which he was likely to come into con- flict. This was the subject of the second of the resolutions on rabbinical status adopted at the 1898 meeting. Specifically, the association called for rabbinical appointments to be made on a permanent basis, with the possibi- lity of an initial period of provisional employment lasting no more than three years. Contemporary practice in this regard varied. In a survey whose results were reported at the 1898 congress, of the eighty-six responses received from a hundred questionnaires circulated, only twenty-five rabbis indicated that they enjoyed appointments with permanent tenure.3' The issue involved more than simple stability of employment, but rather a potential direct opposition of interests between the rabbi and his board. Just as the rabbi saw in permanent appointment a guarantee for his indepen- dence and freedom of expression, so did the board regard conditional appointment as its ultimate control of the rabbi. Without some kind of general regulation favoring the rabbinate, the employers clearly had the upper hand. Collective action by the rabbinate itself was, of course, a possi- bility, though the meeting failed to pursue one speaker's suggestion that 30.

POPPEL rabbis refuse to serve in any community guilty of unfairly firing its rabbi over a religious dispute.32 Whether the guild-consciousness of the rabbinate would have generally sustained such an approach is therefore unknowable, though in at least one earlier case, the opposite was true. In 1862 Leopold Stein, the rabbi of Frankfurt, was fired by the board because he refused to recognize its claimed right of censorship over his sermons. Stein called for a boycott of the position in order to force the board's retraction, but was foiled when Abraham Geiger accepted the post in 1863, claiming that he had satisfied himself that agreement between Stein and the board would never be possible.33 At the same time that it addressed the issue of political control, the call for permanent appointments also touched on a separate economic problem posed by the demographic shift of German Jewry. Especially with the second half of the nineteenth century, German Jewry was becoming more concentrated in urban centers, to a degree even greater than the correspond- ing urban movement of the general German population.34 This meant that the relatively small rural communities that had been so characteristic earlier found their tax base shrinking as their membership declined. In these circumstances the permanent appointment of a rabbi would represent an untenable financial obligation. Indeed a contracting community might forgo the services of a rabbi altogether, and make his duties the part-time responsibility of another community functionary or some other capable community member. The assembly's third resolution on rabbinical status was directed precisely toward forestalling such an erosion in the demand for regular, full-time rabbis by the creation of district rabbinates. These would combine the resources of smaller communities that were by themselves too poor to support rabbis individually in order to hire a single rabbi who would divide his attention among them.35 32.

A fourth resolution addressed a corresponding source of job insecurity posed by the danger of an oversupply of candidates for rabbinical positions. This it proposed to do by putting an effective monopoly on rabbinical certification in the hands of the three exist- ing rabbinical seminaries, on the grounds that this would assure a uniform standard of quality. (These institutions combined traditional Jewish studies with modern, critical approaches, in varying proportions depending on the schools' orientations. The seminaries ranged from the traditionalist Berlin Rabbiner-Seminar, founded in 1873, to the conservative Breslau Jiidisch- theologisches Seminar, founded in 1854, and the liberal Lehranstalt fiir die Wissenschaft des Judentums, founded in Berlin in 1872. In each case students were expected to pursue concurrent doctoral programs in the local university. By the end of the nineteenth century these seminaries had almost completely displaced the traditional yeshiva education as a source of rab- binical training and certification in Germany.)36 In addition to certifying their own students, the seminaries were requested to recognize and certify appropriate preparation done elsewhere. The resolution further proposed that the association create a board of examiners that might exceptionally confer rabbinical certification by itself. Admission to the practicing rabbin- ate in Germany was to be restricted to these avenues. The problem of a domestic oversupply of rabbis, with a corresponding sharpening of competition, that this proposal addressed seemed real enough. For example, in order to regulate competition between neighboring rabbis over emolument income, an 1895 meeting of the Association of Rabbis of the Rhine Province proposed delineating zones in which a given rabbi would have the exclusive right to perform ritual functions.37 (The plan also the post-1902 debate described in part IV below.

It is unclear, however, whether the German Rabbinical Association's proposal would have solved the problem at hand, since it implied that immigrants from outside Germany (particularly Eastern Europe), rather than the rabbis already being turned out by the existing seminaries, were the source of the oversupply. Immigrant pressure had been a serious problem in the past, and there was a clear opposition of interests between German rabbis and German Gemeinden, especially smaller, less attractive ones that might depend on the less expensive services of newly immigrant rabbis from the east.38 Nevertheless the situation had been to some extent alleviated, at least in Prussia, by the government's efforts during the 1880s to exclude and expel all Eastern European Jewish immigrants. That tensions persisted, however, is indicated by the 1892 protest of sixty-seven German rabbis (who held positions in lesser com- munities or were altogether unemployed) against the appointment of an alien as Oberrabbiner of Altona.39 A further difficulty with the certification plan was posed by objections that were already raised when it had been advanced originally, namely, that it violated the traditional right of an individual rabbi to certify the com- petence of his student. In any case implementation proved impossible when of the three seminaries only the Juidisch-theologisches Seminar agreed to certify external candidates.40 IV Unlike the attempt to establish a monopoly on rabbinical certification, the first three of the 1898 resolutions-regarding recognition of the reli- gious authority of the rabbi, permanent tenure of appointment, and district rabbinates-all depended for their realization on the assent and coopera- 38.

The responses from the seminaries are filed in CAHJP: M4/1, in the material from 1899. Further discussion of this proposal at the 1902 assembly pointed to the additional prob- lem that forming the association's own projected board of examiners would be difficult because of sectarian differences. The matter of special certification was referred to the separate liberal and traditionalist rabbinical associations that had meanwhile been established.</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY IN IMPERIAL GERMANY 203 tion of community governing boards. What followed the 1898 meeting was an attempt at collective bargaining between the Rabbinical Association and the Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund (DIGB, Confederation of German Jewish Communities). The DIGB was the closest thing that German Jewry had in this period to a national representative organization. Founded in 1869 the DIGB was meant to serve primarily as a coordinating body and a clearing house for information on common concerns of the Gemeinden, such as community administration, education, and philan- thropy. As a collective organization of governing board representatives it was at once the appropriate negotiating partner as well as the natural adver- sary in the Rabbinical Association's effort to secure a general improvement in the situation of the rabbinate. Hence the association presented its resolutions to the DIGB for adop- tion at its general assembly meeting in 1902.41 The letter of transmittal urged approval in terms of the rabbis' own understanding of their situation: despite the absence in Judaism of any formal distinction between clergy and laity, the fact was that Jewish learning was generally on the decline, which meant that the rabbi, the expert on Judaism, should be accorded a special position of authority within the community. On the face of it, the DIGB's response should have been reassuring. Though it rejected the provision for a rabbinic veto over religious changes, it adopted the rest of the Rabbinical Association's proposals in full, on the understanding that such approval was only advisory, and could not be binding on the separate communities represented. And yet the association's delegation came away with the sense that its triumph was not all that it might have been, a perception that had consi- derable substance. For instead of according the rabbinate the recognition it claimed, the debate had much more conveyed the laity's view of the rabbin- ate as an impediment to progress in Judaism rather than an esteemed leader- ship.42 The DIGB assembly's position came close to that expressed by the Latin phrase Vox populi, vox Dei - not that the voice of God was to be displaced 41. The account of these deliberations appears in DIGB, Mitteilungen 56 (December 1901): 4-5; 58 (May 1902): 6-27. 42. The Rabbinical Association's representative found a telling sign of this attitude in the fact that the lay speakers at the meeting went on at great length, while the association was given little opportunity to present its position.

POPPEL by the dull roar of the masses, but rather that the voice of God might be equally heard, and recounted, by all. While it did not necessarily follow that one person's opinon was as good as the next, it was true that the rabbi's opinion was only that of one man, and deserved no extra weighting. If Jewry found its will balked it might simply vacate the synagogue. "The laity," declared one delegate, "shall and must have a decisive influence."43 Furthermore there were some things about the rabbi that tended to disqualify him from influencing policy. If he was a new arrival to a com- munity he would be unacquainted with local circumstances. (Note the contrast with the traditional community, in which a rabbi's lack of local connections was regarded as ensuring his judicial objectivity. The involv- ment of the rabbi in community affairs was held to be incompatible with the dignity of his office. The strength of the rabbi was that he was above poli- tical dispute; he was not to be dragged into partisan agitation.) One speaker went so far as to say that there was nothing in the qualities for which a rabbi was actually hired-good sermons, teaching ability, a fitting wife, and suffi- cient means so as not to be a burden on the community-that equipped him to deal with practical matters. Thus the rabbi was set upon a pedestal in a way that pretended to exalt him but actually depreciated him. The true status of the spiritual leader depended very much on what real valence was assigned to things of the spirit. Given this current of lay antipathy to the rabbinate, the rabbinate's expectation of being accepted on its own terms was astonishing. An exchange only a few years earlier in the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, the leading organ of the German Jewish press, could have reminded the rabbinate of just how sharp was the opposition to it in some circles. In 1897 Gustave Karpeles (who had succeeded Ludwig Philippson as editor) pub- lished a generally sympathetic lead article entitled "The Status of the Rabbinate."44 In it he decried the fact that the Prussian regime, unlike those of some other German states, still refused to recognize rabbis in the same legal categories as Christian clergy. He pointed out, however, that this slighting of rabbinical status had its supporters among the Jewish laity, and recalled the notorious 1820 memorandum of the Berlin board member Ruben Gumpertz, who informed the Prussian government that the rabbi was little more than a kosher meat inspector. 43.

AZJ 61, no. 7 (Feb. 12, 1897): 73-74.</page><page sequence="21">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY IN IMPERIAL GERMANY 205 Karpeles encouraged the recently reorganized Rabbinical Association to do what it could to enhance rabbinical status within the Jewish community itself, since it was untenable that "the most important changes in religious practice could be made without the agreement of the rabbi-indeed without even asking or informing him in advance." Karpeles warned, however, that in every modern board there lurked a bit of Ruben Gumpertz. The responses to Karpeles's editorial were mixed, but one confirmed his worst fears. Felix Makower, a lawyer active in Jewish community affairs, wrote that while he approved of rabbis' efforts to gain appropriate external legal recognition as clerics, he opposed their efforts to enhance their authority within the community at the expense of governing boards. The board acts as the elected representative of the whole community, whereas the rabbi acts only as an individual. In any case, Makower continued, rabbis are by their very training and outlook unfit to lead the community into the future. The problem with rabbis, as with any clerics, was their constant preoccupation with liturgical and ritual questions, which led them to over- estimate the importance of such matters. What was really at issue was the rabbinate's efforts to further its own professional interests (Standesinteres- sen), which were not necessarily identical with the interests of Jewry as a whole, whatever the rabbis might claim.45 Makower was correct at least in his observation that the rabbinate was quicker to pursue its self-interest than it was to acknowledge that it was doing so. How true this was became clear in the DIGB's debate on the Rabbinical Association's program for the creation of district rabbinates.46 The purpose of this institution was to retain or secure for a rabbi the income from preaching and the performance of ritual duties that would otherwise go to a local community functionary, such as a teacher or nonordained preacher who might serve as the religious factotum. Thus the rabbi's gain would be the local functionary's loss, a fact that one preacher immediately pointed out. He found no reason to believe that rabbis were any better equipped to deal with local spiritual needs than local preachers were, and the same held for teaching. The clearest result of establishing district rab- binates would be to impair the income and status of local religious functionaries. 45. AZJ 61, no. 50 (Dec. 10, 1897): 592-593.

POPPEL The potential financial implications of the district rabbinate plan were admittedly serious, and the rabbi who undertook to establish a pilot district rabbinate in Pasewalk, Pomerania, reported that he took care as far as possible to reserve the performance of religious duties with their attached fees to local officials. He made an exception, however, in cases of funerals where large numbers of Gentiles might be present, and where the board consequently believed that a rabbi would better represent the community to the public than would the local religious officiants.47 The notion that the rabbi had a special advantage when it came to ex- ternal relations was advanced again in 1905, when the whole subject of district rabbinates was reopened for debate at the DIGB's general congress. Here one rabbi conceded that in cases where no rabbi was available teachers had filled a serious gap, but in order to compete in public esteem with Chris- tian clergy Judaism needed a learned and cultured figure like the rabbi. Even within the Jewish community, another rabbi argued, the rabbi enjoyed a certain naturally superior aura, such that in visiting the sick, for example, it was important that a rabbi, and not simply a teacher, appear. While rab- binic speakers generally denied any material interest in the proposal, at least one seemed to concede the point when he accused the teachers of opposing the program because of the pecuniary loss they would sustain. In the end the 1905 congress adopted a compromise resolution, which recognized that conflicting interests were involved, and called on larger communities and their rabbis to support the pastoral and educational efforts of teachers in neighboring smaller communities that could not themselves maintain a rabbi. V The resolutions of the DIGB were only advisory and not legally binding on its member communities. The real test for the Rabbinical Association's program would come in the campaign to secure a binding commitment, for which the current effort to revise Prussian Jewry law offered a welcome opportunity. It was an appropriate opportunity as well, since despite the fact that the Rabbinical Association was nominally one for all of Germany, many of the problems that it tackled were actually specific to the Prussian rabbinate, which included the majority of the German rabbinate. Time and 47. Ibid., 59 (December 1902): 11-13.</page><page sequence="23">RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY IN IMPERIAL GERMANY 207 again in discussions of rabbinical status, authority, and recognition, and of patterns of religious organization, the examples of Baden, Bavaria, and Wuerttemberg were cited as models to be emulated. Consequently it was understandable that the membership of the Rabbinical Association- which in this period ranged around 160 members out of an estimated pos- sible total of approximately 270 German rabbis-came disproportionately from Prussian territories rather than southern Germany.48 Jewish affairs in Prussia were governed by a regulation that had been issued in 1847 and had gone basically unchanged since.49 The impetus to undertake a revision came from the desire within the Jewish community to take account of intervening developments since the edict's original appear- ance, among which were the legal emancipation of the Jews in 1869, and Prussia's accretion of new territories with their separate Jewry laws, which yielded over thirty different sets of regulations. The work of revision was launched around 1900 by the DIGB, and was later joined by the Verband der deutschen Juden, which had been founded in 1904 to serve as a formal representative of German Jewry in dealings with the government. By 1905 the DIGB decided to defer any further consideration of, or attempts to implement, the Rabbinical Association's proposals pending the immiment appearance of the draft of a new Jewry law.50 In a preview of the draft delivered to the DIGB's June 1905 congress, Heinrich Rosin, its author, recognized the need to accommodate the poten- tially divergent interests and claims of clerical and lay elements, and to take explicit account of the rabbinate. (The 1847 law mentioned the rabbinate 48.

POPPEL only as one of a number of professions from which foreigners were ex- cluded.) Regarded specifics Rosin sketched out a position that was closely akin to the Rabbinical Association's. Although the rabbi was not a priest with specially ordained powers, he was a cleric in the sense of one who serves the religious interest of a laity by the use of his special knowledge and related abilities. A distinction would be made between the communities' repre- sentative organs and the administrative ones, in which the rabbinate would be included. The rabbi was to be involved in deliberations on religious matters, and had the right of appeal to a provincial committee in cases where a majority went against him. The rabbi was to be provided with appropriate conditions of employment and compensation, and collective arrangements would be made to assist communities unable to bear the re- lated financial burden themselves.5' The actual draft that Rosin presented in 1906 outlined an elaborate and complex network of governing institutions and arrangements, with two branches-representative and administrative, on each of three levels- local, provincial, and Prussian.52 On the local level the representative body was responsible for religious education, the management of religious affairs, and any fundamental changes in religious services. The rabbi was a member of the administrative synagogue council, where he was allowed to partici- pate in discussions and to vote concerning questions of religious law. He was recognized as the "official professional, expert leader of the community in all religious affairs." If the rabbi opposed a decision of the synagogue coun- cil he could exercise a suspensive veto of eight days to allow for appeal to the provincial synagogue council. While Rosin granted that as a group joined by ties of religion every Jewish community ought to have a rabbi, he deferred for future discussion the actual arrangements for whatever district rabbinates might be necessary to secure this goal. On the provincial and Prussian levels the pattern was altered only in that a proportion of seats on the representative bodies was reserved for rabbis, in a ratio of one rabbi to every four laymen. In the administrative councils the rabbis again had a clear minority position (three out of eleven places on the 51. DIGB, Mitteilungen 65 (October 1905): 6-18. 52.

Rabbis were to be German citizens, to have completed at least three years at a German-language university, and to pass a rabbinical and general qualify- ing examination. Appointments were to be made with life tenure after a maximum probational period of five years. Salary scales were left to be determined, along with the details of pensions and life insurance. Under this plan the rabbi was given the opportunity to participate directly in formulating religious policy, which constituted a marked improvement over situations where he had been allowed-to communicate with the board only by written memoranda and could address it in person only at its own pleasure. Beyond that the rabbi enjoyed only a very modest institutional advantage in exerting whatever personal authority he could muster. These hierarchical and centralized arrangements characterized Rosin's entire draft, and reflected his experience as a member of the similarly or- ganized Oberrat der Israeliten Badens, the governing body of Baden Jewry, which in turn had been modeled after the Napoleonic French consistories. As logical and workable as such a scheme may have seemed to Rosin, it violated Prussian Jewry's established pattern of local community autonomy, which had the advantage of accommodating the mutual suspicions held by the overwhelmingly large and powerful Berlin community and the smaller though more numerous others. Moreover, despite reassurances to the con- trary, it aroused fears of centralized intervention in the religious affairs of local communities, a prospect feared equally by liberals and traditionalists. (Such an intervention was, of course, exactly what the Rabbinical Associa- tion aimed for, insofar as it sought a centrally adopted arrangement that would bolster the authority of the individual rabbi in the local community.) Despite the generally favorable response that Rosin had won with his pre- liminary sketch at the 1905 DIGB congress, the actual draft seemed certain to be rejected. An alternative was quickly proposed by Heinrich Machol, a lawyer who had been involved with the DIGB project at its outset, but who had had to abandon it in its early stages. Machol proceeded from the premise that only the 1847 Jewry law with its provision for the autonomy of separate com- munities could serve as a precedent for new legislation. The Jewry regula- tions of other states allowed too much government intervention, and too large a say by rabbis in religious and even general communal and adminis- trative matters. Machol's draft placed religious affairs in the control of the board, with the rabbi assured only of the possibility of communicating his</page><page sequence="26">210 STEPHEN M. POPPEL opinion by way of formal memoranda. In taking this position Machol declared himself to be following the lead of the 1902 DIGB congress, whose rejection of any rabbinical veto right he understood as a rejection of any special influence for the rabbi in governing religious affairs. The only con- cession to the rabbi's expertise came in the single seat reserved for a rabbi out of the twenty-three on the overall Prussian Jewish council, so that the council could provide an informed response to any government inquiries on religious matters. (A second seat was similarly reserved for a legal expert.)53 The two drafts were referred for further consideration to a mixed commission of representatives of the DIGB and the Verband der deutschen Juden, which produced its report in April 1909. This combined draft basically followed the lines that Machol had set.54 Local communities were guaranteed their autonomy in religious affairs. A rabbi was allowed to express his views on specifically listed aspects of religious affairs by way of written communications, and only exceptionally through direct, oral pre- sentation. After a maximum provisional period of three years a rabbi was to be given a contract for at least twelve years, which could be renewed there- after for like periods. Boards were permitted to make appointments with life tenure if they wished. The regulation also made provision for pension and severance payments, and for death benefits. Like its predecessors this third draft failed to secure broad enough community support to serve as the basis for actual legislation. As far as provisions for the rabbinate were concerned, despite partial concessions on the terms and conditions of employment it still maintained the humiliating and thoroughly subordinate position of the rabbi to the board.55" The discus- sion at the ensuing 1909 DIGB congress made it clear that this approach enjoyed considerable lay sympathy.56 Here the rabbinate's representatives 53.

In this resolution, which was apparently drafted after the 1909 DIGB debate, the association added to its basic three-part program a demand for extended control over the appointment of other community officials, and over community religious education. The relevant sections read: "Alle beim Kultus und im Religionsunterricht tdtigen Beamten k6nnen nur nach fibereinstim- mender Entschliessung der Gemeindevertretung (Vorstand und Repraisentanten) und des Rabbinats angestellt werden"; and "Die Religionsschule untersteht in schultechnischer Bezie- hung dem Vorstande, in Bezug auf Lehrstoff und die zu verwendenden Lehrbiicher dem Rabbinat." 56.

They also asserted that the community owed it to itself to invest its clergyman, the rabbi, with the dignity appropriate to his office, so that he could stand as a worthy representative of Jewry and Judaism to the outside world. This ingenious argument failed to have its effect, as did the others. Opponents insisted that if the rabbi sought to make his views prevail within the community, it had to be on the basis of his own personal prestige and authority, and not by virtue of any artificial powers of his office. The conscience of the community had to be regarded, as well as the conscience of the individual rabbi, and the whole community could not be subject to one man's will. "We are willing to take account of the interests of the rabbis," a Justizrat explained, "but in the interest of Judaism, in the interest of the community, we must reject the demand for life tenure and a veto right for the rabbi."" On the whole it was a resounding defeat, an ex- plicit rejection of the core of the Rabbinical Association's program. VI The failure of the Rabbinical Association's decade-long campaign for an improvement in the status of the German rabbi produced serious reflec- tions on the place of the rabbi in the community, the nature of rabbinical authority, and the proper role of the rabbi. One of the most sobering of these came in the address that the Dortmund rabbi and Bible scholar Benno Jacob delivered to a regional conference of rabbis in Cologne in 1910. Jacob pointed out that the Jews, a people defined by their religion, were in some ways the most irreligious. The proposed revision of Prussia's Jewry law would have given lay leaders a decisive voice in religious affairs, even in- volving rabbinical certification, despite the fact that religious criteria were never foremost in the choice of board members, who often were only mar- ginally involved in Judaism. Although in spiritual (as contrasted with administrative) matters the rabbi was the community's proper guide, he was being reduced to a subordinate functionary. Despite the historical and theoretical possibility of dispensing with an official, professional rabbinate, with the dissolution of traditional observance and the disappearance of a 57.

The lay direction of reli- gious affairs was an absurdity. The draft Jewry law made the preaching and teaching rabbi the "one man in the community who speaks most but has least to say."58 Perhaps more telling were the remarks made at the 1909 DIGB congress by a liberal rabbi who conceded that the demand for a veto right itself might be irrelevant. If the rabbi ever had such power before, he said, it was only because he and the community stood on the common ground of the law. The source of the rabbi's authority was a consensus on the basis of tradition. In its absence the demand for a veto power came a hundred and fifty years too late. Except in traditionalist communities, where the rabbi could still base his claim on Jewish law, the demand for a veto was effectively a demand for personal power, but one that lacked any institutional foundation. Further- more it was either gratuitous or destructive: either the rabbi and the com- munity agreed, in which case there was no need for a veto, or the rabbi was at odds with the community, in which case the attempt to exercise a veto would only be destructive.59 The implication was one that a critic had already expressed, namely, that if the rabbi were to have any authority at all, it would have to derive from his personal standing, and not his official status.60 Thus the rabbinate was confusing cause and effect; the incumbent should invest the office with the authority. Indeed this is something that one rabbi after another had stated all along. Rather than demand status as an expert, the rabbi could win esteem as an exemplar of virtue, devotion, and religious commitment, and as an object of love, trust, and respect.6' The remarkable thing was that on this point layman and rabbi fundamentally agreed. One seasoned lay leader 58. Benno Jacob, Die Stellung des Rabbiners in dem Entwurf eines Gesetzes betreffend die Verfassung der jiidischen Religions-Gemeinschaft in Preussen.

He can neither permit nor forbid, but can only teach what is permitted and forbidden."63 But what laymen cited as a rebuke and a challenge could also be an opportunity and a promise. The German Jewish laity was willing to concede a place to the rabbi, if not as a bearer of tradition, then in some sense as the keeper of the faith-though one to be heeded only insofar as he could make his own voice heard. His was an office that lacked the independent authority that the rabbi desired, and that he thought it once had. It was a place whose shape was uncertain, but whose changing dimensions were ultimately the measure of the rabbi and of the community that he sought to lead. New York, N.Y.
