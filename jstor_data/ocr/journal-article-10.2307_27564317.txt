<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ted Merwin. In Their Own Image: New York Jews in Jazz Age Popular Culture. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2006. xiii, 215 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000785 Eddie Cantor was famous for performing in blackface, and in Whoopee (1930), he pretended to be an Indian. But so evident was his actual ethnicity that in a short Paramount film titled Insurance (1929), Cantor was asked on which side he was Jewish. He replied, "The East Side" (41). That is the parcel of Lower Manhattan that Ted Merwin locates as the capital of American Jewish culture in the 1920s, the neighborhood that had been the demographic center of the most populous Jewish community in history, the site on which movies intended to present an authentic portrayal of the ghetto were filmed, the launching pad from which many figures in mass entertainment blasted off, and finally, the stimulus of nostalgia ever since. The decade that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Jazz Age was also the Jews' Age, according to Merwin, who asserts that "the Great Depression essentially brought the Golden Age of Jewish entertainment ... to an end" (162). That radi ance is defined as the expression of Jewish ethnicity (and to a lesser extent religion), targeting not only appreciative, Yiddish-speaking audiences but also projecting to everyone else the physiognomy and the piety of an immigrant com munity and its native-bom offspring. In three sprightly chapters, Merwin brings on the vaudevillians (Cantor, Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker), the Broadway hits (Montague Glass's Potash and Perlmutter, Osip Dymov's Bronx Express), and the mostly silent films (His People, The Kibitzer). Merwin also looks at comic sketches such as "Cohen on the Telephone" and comic strips such as Harry Hersh field's Abie the Agent. As Merwin's title suggests, he is more attentive to what is staged and screened and seen than to what is read and heard. But a scholar wishing to make the strongest possible case for a golden age could certainly have included?on historical if not on aesthetic criteria?the fiction of Anzia Yezierska, who is mentioned in passing (though the 1922 adaptation of Hungry Hearts is treated at greater length), as well as novels by Samuel Omitz (Haunch, Paunch and Jowl, 1923), Ludwig Lewisohn 417</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews (The Island Within, 1928), and Ben Hecht (A Jew in Love, 1931). The tunesmiths of Tin Pan Alley mostly avoided Jewish themes, and Merwin is probably right not to pursue the elusive musicological leads that might connect the melodies of Irving Berlin or George Gershwin to liturgical echoes. In Their Own Image is amusingly evocative in showing how eagerly the Jews of Hollywood embraced one other ethnic group in particular, with half a dozen versions of The Cohens and the Kellys, plus ancillary films such as Private Izzy Murphy (1926), Kosher Kitty Kelly (1926), and Clancy's Kosher Wedding (1927). Merwin's absorption in the archives?he pays special tribute to the Billy Rose Theatre Collection at Lincoln Center?has nevertheless yielded a parodistic gem showing how deeply Jewish songs were entwined with the black music that constituted the soundtrack of the Jazz Age. Make It Snappy (1922) included a song credited to Cantor, Alex Gerber, and Jean Schwartz, "My Yiddisha Mammy," in which Cantor kidded his rival Al Jolson by reminding audiences which minority group had become so adept at putting on the mask of another race. "All the mammies they call divine/Come from below the Mason Dixon line"?except for his own Bronx-based mother. She "never heard about dear old Black Joe/She's never been where the sweet magnolias grow." Moreover, "she don't play a banjo or ukelele,/But her lullaby is Eli, Eli" (56). The contrasts of race and place on display in "My Yiddisha Mammy" suggest an immersion in the popular arts that Merwin insists became pivotal to the identity of Jazz Age Jewry, which spent all those years in the dark. That process by which mass entertainment both mirrored and determined, created and confirmed how that generation defined itself on native grounds is the only justification for writing, as Merwin does, as though this was the first decade to blur the lines between "American" and "Jewish." Adaptation to 1920s America?whether by rejecting the authority of religion, by reducing Jew ishness to social associations with other Jews, or by ascending into the comforta ble classes?looks novel only when we ignore the nineteenth-century precedent of German Jews. They, too, chose to reconcile the quest for civic equality with the claims of ancestral loyalties. They often did so outside New York City?and indeed outside major urban areas as well. But their version of American Jewish identity anticipated what Merwin finds pioneering among the progeny of eastern European immigrants. The author gently criticizes this reviewer for including in American Jewish culture much more than artifacts brandishing an explicit or evident Jewish content. Merwin claims that, whatever ambivalence second-generation Jewry har bored about its religious heritage or distinctive folkways, the desire to become American did not entail utter detachment from an ancient people and its destiny. Fair enough. But the result is a book that tends to minimize how deep was the undertow that pulled that generation into the mainstream. Merwin is more likely to highlight the tenacity of the claims of peoplehood than to notice the ferocity with which Jews propelled themselves away from "the ghetto." To move up was largely to move away. Thus, In Their Own Image notes the leadership of Paramount's Adolph Zukor in a major Jewish philanthropic campaign in 1925. Unmentioned is how 418</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews rare such communal service was, how indifferent other moguls were to normative Jewish life and its institutions. Because the ideology of the first "talkie" is assim ilationist, comedian George Jessel is praised for opting not to star in The Jazz Singer (1927). "I owe my success in great measure to the Jewish public," he explained a year later, "and the Jewish public expects me to be loyal to it" (119). A better explanation, however, was Warner Brothers' refusal to meet his chutzpahdik salary demands. For about double the paycheck that Jolson accepted, Jessel would gladly have become "Jakie Rabinowitz." Nor did the ending of the film, with Jolson singing "Mammy" to his momma and to his multitudinous other fans, cause that proud Jewish public to spurn The Jazz Singer. Consider how much stronger Merwin's own case for the 1920s would be if his definition of Jewish culture were broad enough to embrace "universalists" such as Berlin and Gershwin, S. J. Perelman and George S. Kaufman, Harry Houdini and Erich Von Stroheim, Edna Ferber and Gertrude Stein. Yet In Their Own Image is casual enough in its categories to include Abie's Irish Rose (1922). If the Gentile Anne Nichols's sensational play could make the list, why exclude the greatest novel of the decade, in which Fitzgerald imagined a gangster whom Edith Wharton hailed as a ''perfect Jew"? Meyer Wolfsheim gives Jay Gatsby the necessary imprimatur of criminality and corruption to befoul the American Dream. Harry Hershfield gets pride of place because of a comic strip in which the main character is Jewish. But the name Rube Goldberg, who ignored Jewish topics, endures because of the ingenuity with which he devised outlandish con traptions to perform simple tasks. And the most prestigious honor that the National Cartoonists Society can bestow is the Reuben, named after the organization's first president. Historians may be troubled by a book that insists that a single decade framed the aspirations and achievements of a generation. The parents came at different times and at different ages, so that even a term like "second generation" is much fuzzier than In Their Own Image acknowledges. The second generation was more plausibly an interwar phenomenon; Clifford Odets's 1935 drama Awake and Sing! recorded the voice of the second generation as faithfully as any thing done a decade earlier (as Merwin seems to concede). Also representative of that generation are Delmore Schwartz's short story, "In Dreams Begin Responsi bilities" (1937), and Alfred Kazin's memoir, A Walker in the City (1951). The most honored of American Jewish novelists, Saul Bellow, was also second generation. But he was only fourteen when the stock market crash brought down the Jazz Age. Squeezing the experience of so amorphous a group as American Jewry's second generation into a single historical moment is therefore highly debatable. But the virtue of this book is that it is very much worth debating. Stephen J. Whitfield Brandeis University Waltham, Massachusetts 419</page></plain_text>
