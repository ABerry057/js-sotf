<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FORMATION OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE CORPUS by EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN Following the lead of Spinoza,' most of us have come to regard the sequence of Hebrew narrative from Genesis through Kings as a unified liter- ary composition. It tells the story of Israel and its God from the creation of sky and land through the exile of Israel from its particular land. Although the anonymous narrator focuses on the fate of his people, he virtually always tries to identify with YHWH's point of view. For this reason, and possibly others, the narrator submerges his own identify and background.2 This essay was originally presented at "The Hebrew Bible in the Making," a conference held at the National Humanities Center, April 27-29, 1988. I am grateful to Professor Shemaryahu Talmon for inviting the paper; to my thoughtful respondents, Professors David Daiches and Regina Schwartz; to the several participants in the conference who made helpful suggestions; and to my colleague David Marcus, who provided food for thought and material in composing this paper. 1.

GREENSTEIN Unlike his near-contemporary Herodotus, who begins his Histories by introducing himself and his explicit agenda, the Hebrew author speaks from a perspective as wide as the cosmos. He would seem to assume the authority of God and give voice to a divinely certified account of his people's his- torical experience to (one assumes) his own community. There is a broad consensus that the entire narrative took something like its present shape in the sixth to fifth centuries B.C.E. No one imagines that the author composed the whole from scratch, but when we begin to specu- late on what exactly lay before the author and where those materials came from, we find a wide array of literary historical models. Some posit a process of several centuries, from as far back as the mid-second millennium to the fifth century.3 Others see intense literary activity toward the end of this period, utilizing documents of some antiquity, but composing the bulk of the work de novo.4 Within this rough scheme lie a large variety of positions.5 Confronted by many alternatives, one might conclude that it is best to give up the search. Gunkel had warned decades ago: 3. Cf., e.g., E. A. Speiser, "The Biblical Idea of History in Its Common Near Eastern Set- ting," in The Jewish Expression, ed. Judah Goldin (New York: Bantam Books, 1970), pp. 1-17, esp. p. 8, who maintains that the Hebrew "canon" began to "emerge"-"no doubt in oral form at first"-in the mid-second millennium, "close to the age of the patriarchs." In his Anchor Bible Genesis (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1964), pp. 105-109, Speiser argued that the Genesis 14 tale about Abraham's warring is based on an early-second-millennium Akka- dian source. Alexander Rof6, "The Story of Rebekah's Betrothal (Genesis 24)," Eshel Beer- sheva 1 (1976): 42-67, esp. p. 45 [in Hebrew], represents a more moderate position, according to which some biblical texts may have second-millennium origins, while others, like Genesis 24, may derive from the postexilic period. Shemaryahu Talmon, "Kingship and the Ideology of the State," in World History of the Jewish People, ed. Abraham Malamat and Israel Eph'al (Jeru- salem: Massada, 1979), vol. 4/2, pp. 3-26, may not attribute historical Israelite sources to as far back as the second millennium B.C.E., but he views the literary growth of biblical historio- graphy as a centuries-long process (esp. p. 3). 4. Cf., e.g., John Van Seters, In Search of History: Historiography in the Ancient World and the Origins of Biblical History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983). For an only some- what more moderate view, cf. Klaus Koch, The Growth of the Biblical Tradition: The Form- Critical Method, trans. S. M. Cupitt, 2nd ed. (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969), who posits early oral traditions but holds that they were given written form only "relatively late" (pp. 84-85). The exilic Deuteronomist, writes Koch (p. 85), "had some sources at his disposal, but apparently only some." 5. For a survey of recent scholarship, see Douglas A. Knight, "The Pentateuch," and Peter R. Ackroyd, "The Historical Literature," in The Hebrew Bible and Its Modern Interpreters, ed. D. A. Knight and Gene M.

Too much is at stake. To say anything at all about ancient Israelite history, one must have some theory of how the Bible and its sources were formed. What world, or piece of a world, does the literature represent? Even to read the text as literature, one must have some idea of its historical set- ting.7 Certainly the historical dimension enriches the reading experience. Everyone who reads the Bible presupposes a historical context. Some are curious enough to ponder the historical development of the Bible carefully and articulate their views. In what follows, I shall describe some types of literary historical reconstruction. I shall try to indicate the sorts of evidence and argumentation that are adduced in support of the various models. I shall then tackle the question of the origins of the narratives that constitute the Bible's primary history (Genesis-Kings)8 by examining certain kinds of evidence in detail, assessing the power of different historical theories to han- dle such evidence. When I consider the various models by which the primary biblical narra- tive was formed, I think of the story of the blind men and the elephant.9 You will recall that each of five blind men approaches a different part of an ele- phant's anatomy. Perceiving only part of the elephant, each man draws a different conclusion as to the identity of what he encounters. I do not mean 6.

GREENSTEIN to imply that Bible scholars are blind, but I do suggest that the literary his- tory of Hebrew narrative is at least as bulky and complex as an elephant and that without an explicit historical context we find ourselves in the dark. Although no model I know does full justice to the diverse data-to the entire elephant, as it were-each theory makes a reasonable hypothesis about some aspect of the phenomenon. Take first the classical form of the Documentary Hypothesis-the theory that a redactor compiled a text from preexisting documents.'0 Its subscribers respond most acutely to what they regard as unwarranted repeti- tion and consistent variation. In the words of A. Lods: It will be understood that by careful observation of doublets, abrupt changes, differences of vocabulary and style, references to earlier accounts, it is possible to distinguish the different hands which have helped to produce the books as we read them today." The documentary model provides a straightforward solution to such data as: similar stories that appear at least twice, laws that occur in different places with distinctive vocabulary and sometimes variant content, and re- petitive passages (that can be explained as conflations of discrete sources, such as the Genesis flood story). Lods saw evidence for the documentary model within the Bible itself, especially in the Chronicler's use of Samuel and Kings.'2 The so-called Deuteronomistic History was composed, in Lods's scheme, by editing sources such as those that lay behind the Torah narratives, and by adding both oral traditions from later history and pri- mary documents from the royal court.'3 10. For recent evidence that this theory is alive and well, cf. Richard E. Friedman, Who Wrote the Bible? (New York: Summit, 1987). 11.

Sometimes, as in the truncated genealogy in Exod. 6:14-27, which begins with the tribe of Reuben and ends with the Levites Moses and Aaron, it looks as if an editor has incorporated the text from another document.16 In other places, such as Genesis 5, a putative source includes its own independent heading (verse 1).17 It is generally supposed that songs, some of which are attributed to specific sources, have been introduced wholesale from elsewhere and not newly composed for the present context.'8 Even lengthy narratives, such as 14. Cf. my "The State of Biblical Studies; or, Biblical Studies in a State," Essays on Biblical Method, pp. 3-27, esp. 5-10. 15. Driver, Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament, p. 5. 16. Cf. my "Sources of the Pentateuch," in Harper's Bible Dictionary, ed. Paul J. Achte- meier (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1985), pp. 983-986, esp. 983-984. What looks like an editorial operation from a diachronic perspective may look like an artful compositional technique from a synchronic one. An excellent case in point is provided by the phenomenon of "resumptive repetition," which had been regarded by scholars as an editor's linking device, but has been considered a narrational strategy by Shemaryahu Talmon, "The Presentation of Synchroneity and Simultaneity in Biblical Narratives," in Studies in Hebrew Narrative Art, ed. Joseph Heinemann and Shmuel Werses, Scripta Hierosolymitana 27 (Jerusa- lem: Magnes Press, 1978), pp. 9-26; and Burke O. Long, "Framing Repetitions in Biblical Historiography," Journal of Biblical Literature 106 (1987): 385-399. Although Long treats the "framing repetition" within a synchronic narratology, he allows that this reflects the particular "model" he adopts. Long acknowledges that within a literary historical model the very same phenomena could be explained as redactional work (see esp. p. 399). David Damrosch, in The Narrative Covenant: Transformations of Genre in the Growth of Bib- lical Literature (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1987), has attempted to add a diachronic dimension to synchronic literary analysis. I do not, however, believe that one can go beyond this to merge a synchronic and diachronic paradigm, because in the end a critic must repeatedly decide whether to relate to a phenomenon as a primary or secondary object of interpretation; cf. my discussion of Damrosch's book, "On the Genesis of Biblical Prose Narrative," Proof- texts 8 (1988): 347-354. I discuss this problem, too, in my review of Adele Berlin's Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative, in AJS Review 12 (1987): 279-282. 17.

GREENSTEIN the David story, are thought by proponents of this model to have been edit- ed in.'9 The documentary model, then, comprises two main literary stages: the composition of primary sources and the editorial integration of those sources. Before proceeding, we should perhaps call attention to some parts of the elephant that the documentary model may have missed or misrepresented. One is the notorious incompleteness of many of the narrative documents.20 The conventional sources J, E, and P appear to many critics to be assem- blages of commonly transmitted materials rather than extensive, unified texts.2' Another is that the integration of documents would need to be far more involved than the classical model allows. The wilderness itinerary, for example, as Coats has shown, transgresses the boundaries of the Tetrateuch and continues into Joshua.22 The conjunction of the Torah and Joshua would be expected to be the work of the Deuteronomist. Yet the reiteration of the laws concerning cities of refuge in Joshua 20 repeats not so much the formulation of Deuteronomy 19 as that of Numbers 35-a Priestly text.23 Growth of the Old Testament, pp. 36-41; Ernst Sellin-Georg Fohrer, Introduction to the Old Testament, trans.

Cf., e.g., Friedman, Exile and Biblical Narrative, pp. 46-47, 80, with reference, too, to the work of F. M. Cross. 21. Cf., e.g., Hermann Gunkel, The Legends of Genesis, trans. W. H. Carruth (New York: Schocken, 1964), p. 130; North, "Pentateuchal Criticism," pp. 57, 59, 78-79; Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, p. 293 and passim; Damrosch, Narrative Covenant, pp. 166, 172, who, following Gunkel, regards even J as a "school" transmitting "several separate scrolls." In an original and penetrating analysis of the Jacob "cycle," Zeev Weisman. From Jacob to Israel [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1986), contends that the Jacob material stems essentially from the same corpus, corresponding to what source critics call "E." Although Weisman works (as a revisionist) within the documentary model, his "E" may resemble more the corpus of material as conceived by Gunkel. 22. Coats, "Wilderness Itinerary," p. 141. 23. For example, Num. 35:11 ff. and Josh. 20:1 ff. (but not Deut. 19:1 ff.) refer to the towns as "cities of refuge" ('are miqlat) where the fugitive must "stand before the assembly for judg-</page><page sequence="7">FORMATION OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE CORPUS 157 Most strikingly, Joshua, like Numbers, enjoins the fugitive to remain in the city "until the high priest's death."24 Joshua's version of the law contains P with only a touch of D (cf., e.g., Deut. 19:6 and Josh. 20:5). Indeed, Kaiser maintains, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole, that "scholars are generally convinced that P plays the leading part in [Joshua 13-21]" altogether.25 In addition, the documentary model must assign songs, lists, and other, nonintegrated passages to the prehistory of the putative sources. If there is so substantial an amount of material that does not belong properly to the authors of the sources themselves, why should the material be assigned to the sources at all? The hypothetical redactor may have incorporated any or all of that material directly. The redactor may have been more of an author than the model supposes. Finally, within the prose of the narrative are numerous instances of archaic or poetic language and couplets in parallelism. Although a smatter- ing of such verse units might well be interpreted as a stylistic property of classical Hebrew prose, such units frequently occur abruptly, intensively, leaving some readers with the impression that they reflect an alien source. A parade example is Gen. 7:1 b: nivqe'u kol ma'yenot tehom rabba, wa'arubbot hashamayim niftahu, "All the founts of the Great Deep burst, and the win- dows of the Sky opened" (cf. also 8:2). As Gunkel observed, the "ancient and highly poetic ... representation" of Gen. 7:1 lb "contrasts starkly" with ment." For delineation of the textual elements of P and D in Joshua 20, see Yehezkel Kauf- mann, The Book of Joshua [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Kiryat Sefer, 1966), p. 229. Martin Noth, Uberlieferungsgeschichtliche Studien (Tiibingen: Max Niemeyer, 1967), pp. 189-190, had in- sisted that despite the presence of P material, the basis of Joshua 20 is still Deuteronomic, but his view has not held sway. John Gray, ed., Joshua, Judges and Ruth (London: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1967), pp. 25-26, observes the intermixture of P and D in Joshua 20 and concludes that this chapter's "literary history ... is rather more complicated" than most of the book. But while Gray explains the similarities among Deuteronomy 4 and 19, Numbers 35, and Joshua 20-21 as the result of mutual influence in the course of transmission, J. Alberto Soggin, Joshua: A Commentary, trans. R. A. Wilson (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1972), p. 197, attributes the strong Priestly component in Joshua 20 to the heavy hand of a P redactor. Robert G. Boling, Joshua (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1984), p. 473, notes the parallels of Joshua 20 to both Numbers 35 and Deuteronomy 19, but he draws no conclusions. From Boling's criti- cism of Henry McKeating's dating of the city of refuge institution to the seventh century ("The Development of the Law on Homicide in Ancient Israel," Vetus Testamentum 25 [1975]: esp. 53-55), one may infer that he regards the tradition as ancient and holds that the various biblical sources received a similar tradition. 24.

GREENSTEIN the "very prosaic" date-formula that precedes it.26 To many such passages as this seem more appropriate in an epic, like those from second- millennium Ugarit. Approaching the elephant on its poetic quarter, Cassuto on the one hand and virtually the entire Albright "school" on the other view the convention- al sources as later prose transformations of earlier epics-narratives trans- mitted orally in verse.27 Cassuto found, for example, characteristics he asso- ciated with Canaanite epic in the so-called Priestly creation story in Genesis 1: poetic diction such as tehom, "the sea"; archaic formations such as hay- yeto 'ereS, "wild animals";28 chiastic, parallelistic syntax, as in verse 5: "Elohim called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night."29 In the exodus narrative Albright identified (and partly reconstructed) what 26.

For a critical discussion and survey of scholarship on the question, see Charles Conroy, "Hebrew Epic: Historical Notes and Critical Reflections," Biblica 61 (1980): 1-30.

Quite interestingly, Gunkel, Genesis, p. 110, observes that the archaic expression hay- yeto 'ereS is placed in the deity's quoted speech (Gen. 1:24) while the narrator uses the more prosaic hayyat ha'ares (v. 25). 29.

The Jahwistic narratives or the priestly narratives are complex types of this kind in which, with varying degrees of skillfulness, a number of units originally independent have been brought together.33 Coats provides an illustration by isolating various early legends within the Moses narrative-the heroic birth episode, Moses' entry into the household of the Midianite priest, Moses' stamina in defeating the Amalekites, Moses' role as national storyteller, the death report in which YHWH buries him.34 Another quality of epic narration is lengthy repetition. The principle on which epic verse is distinguished from narrative prose is this: lengthy repeti- tion is characteristic of oral (sung) material and is not tolerated in prose (read) discourse.35 On the basis of a few clues in 1 Samuel 17, Heda Jason 30.

Bruce Kawin, Telling It Again and Again (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972), p. 9. This principle should be regarded more as a guideline than a law. Gary Rendsburg has helpfully suggested to me that the Egyptian story of "The Shipwrecked Sailor," dated to ca. 2000 B.C.E., might pose a challenge to the principle, as it is essentially a "prose" narrative in which one finds a few repetitive passages; see e.g., William K. Simpson, The Literature of Ancient Egypt (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972), pp. 50-56. It may be, however, that this text serves to "prove" the "rule." Though written (and remarkably well preserved), the story contains telltale signs of an oral character, such as bursts of parallelism (e.g., "Wash your- self; place water on your fingers"; "For the speech of a man saves him, and his words gain him indulgence"; p. 51). Moreover, by contrast to, e.g., Ugaritic epic, the repetitions here are not entirely verbatim, as they involve both expansion and variation. They are, as Rendsburg observes, the sorts of repetition one finds routinely in biblical prose narrative.</page><page sequence="10">160 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN posits an epic behind the prose version of the Goliath story.36 If there were in fact epiclike narratives behind some biblical texts, one can find evidence of the transformation. In Josh. 6:1 ff. Joshua instructs the priests and other Israelites on what to do in order to defeat Jericho. Beginning with verse 12, as in an epic, the text describes in similar language how the Israelites ful- filled Joshua's order. In verse 14, however, the prose narrative abbreviates; it makes short shrift of how the Israelites repeated on the second day what they did on the first; and then it skips to the climactic day seven. In an epic, of course, each day or pair of days would be treated to a complete account.37 The narrative of Elijah and his servant in 1 Kings 18:43-44 reduces the seven-day activity even further. It jumps from the first day to the seventh. Theoretically it is possible that the Elijah episode began as an epiclike narra- tion. Of course, this does not prove that the present prose narratives evolved from earlier epics in verse. But a blind man who is most impressed by the elephant's repetitions and seven-day counting patterns may surmise that they did. Those who favor a history of oral transmission behind the present narra- tives can point to a large number of biblical passages which imply that one generation tells its story to the next (e.g., Exod. 12:24-27, 13:7-8, 14-15; Deut. 4:9-10, 6:6-7, 20-25, 32:7; Josh. 4:6-22, 22:24-28; Judg. 6:13; Ps. 44:2, 78:1-5; Isa. 38:19b).38 Von Rad and others provide a cultic or other Sitz im Leben in which the oral narration might have taken place.39 Nevertheless, the blind man at the poetry quarter may still be extrapolating the wrong conclusion.

The alleged remnants of verse that critics adduce may represent nothing more than stylistic features that had been normalized within the Hebrew prose discourse.41 Accordingly, there are those who approach the elephant and find neither the characteristics of lost epic nor a proliferation of sources. They find a relatively smooth surface, remarkably unified in both style and ideology. I am thinking primarily of models like those of Rendtorff or Van Seters.42 By concentrating on the Abraham narratives in the Torah and the David story in the so-called Deuteronomistic History, Van Seters identifies not diverse composites but orderly literary progressions, each stage composed as an alternative or revision of the preceding one. Van Seters's image of the author is a Hebrew Herodotus, who, as some classicists suggest concerning the Greek Herodotus, varied his style and invented the sources from which he purportedly quotes.43 Like Lods, who pointed to Chronicles as a model for 40.

A more radical version of the model that accounts for the composition of biblical nar- ratives through repeated efforts of supplementation is that presented in N. H. Tur-Sinai, "Sifrut hammiqra'-mahi?" in his Hallashon vehassefer, sefer vol. (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1959), pp. 3-57, esp. 51-56. Tur-Sinai imagines a diverse corpus of early brief stories, proverbs, songs, and laws, each reflecting an authentic tradition. These, he contends, were expanded and elaborated into full narratives and legal passages by scribal tradents. He bases this sketchy model on his hypothesis that virtually all the psalms and other poetic texts were composed as extensive expansions of short songs by the royal court bards concerning episodes in the lives of David and Solomon-a theory that seems quite bizarre by most standards. The present form of the primary biblical narrative Tur-Sinai attributes to redactors who selected and abridged material from numerous and lengthy sources (p. 51). 43. Esp. Van Seters, In Search of History, pp. 31-54 and passim.</page><page sequence="12">162 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN the Documentary Hypothesis, Van Seters invokes the Chronicler as another Hebrew historian who made up sources and traditions.44 One wonders whether Van Seters could have derived the same conclu- sions had he first encountered the elephant in Genesis 1-11 or in the legal or poetic passages. And while the degree of homogeneity in thought and expression in the narrative material from Genesis through Kings is high indeed, Northwest Semitic epigraphic material, though sparse, does not exhibit radical changes in style over the course of centuries.45 Compare, for example, the ninth-century Moabite inscription of Mesha with so-called Deuteronomistic prose on the one hand and the sixth-century Lachish let- ters on the other. Moreover, the Deuteronomistic theology that Van Seters would ascribe to a sixth-century writer is quite close to that of ninth- century Moab.46 On account of the elephant's many-sidedness, I incline toward the many critics who see the final formation of the primary biblical narrative as a complicated process mixing diverse genres, many sources, oral and written, long and short. Like Job, who did not understand how the Leviathan was made, I do not pretend that I can unravel or reconstruct the creation of the remarkable history of Israel's covenant up to the Babylonian exile. I admit to my bias that the composition process was shorter rather than longer. I imagine, with McKenzie and others, that the process of consolidating Israel's literature began during the nationalistic revival period of Josiah.47 44. Cf.

GREENSTEIN The impression that the elephant hangs together and displays a textural sameness is widely shared. The common explanation for this uniformity has been articulated by Bright: The David Biography (2 Sam. 12-20; 1 Kgs. 1-2), the other narratives of the Samuel-Saul-David cycles, and to a great extent JE, exhibit great similarity of style. But this is explained by the fact that all represent the classic narrative prose of the Golden Age [of Solomon].54 A broad range of scholars attribute both the core narratives about David and the so-called J source to the late tenth century.55 Some see the influence of the presumably traditional J stories in shaping the David narratives. Most recently, for example, Damrosch has contended that the classic stories about Eden, Cain and Abel, and the Flood served as paradigms for certain episodes in the so-called Succession Narrative.56 Brueggemann had taken the opposite position: the early J narratives generalize themes from the David story.57 What lies behind these and other perspectives on the literary 54.

I would go further. The most out- standing feature of biblical narrative, from Genesis through Kings, is that between the Torah on one side and the so-called Deuteronomistic History (or Former Prophets) on the other there is a very high incidence of repeti- tion-of stories, motifs, characters, names of persons and places, phrases, as well as ideology and themes. Indeed, I am struck by the fact that within this extensive narrative there is a relatively small corpus of narrative material. Any theory of the formation of the biblical narrative corpus must account for this fact: The narrator is all too often telling different versions of the same story.58 I am not thinking only of similar episodes that keep recurring to the same cast of characters. In this category belong the much-discussed wife- sister deception tales in Genesis59 and the story-types studied by Culley, such as the repeated punishments of the Israelites in the wilderness and the wonder-workings of Elijah and Elisha.60 Here, too, one could list the twice- told stories of how David and Saul had close encounters in a cave6' and the like.62 But I am speaking of similar narratives that relate to an entirely dif- ferent set of figures, often a remote epoch away from each other. Many of these occur once (or more) in the Torah and then again in the Former Prophets (Joshua through Kings). A fairly oft-noted example is the parallelism between the Judah and Tamar story in Genesis 38 and the rape of Tamar episode in 2 Samuel 13.63 58. Cf. the impression of a sophisticated lay reader: "The Bible likes parallel stories with a difference"; Lore Segal, "II Samuel," in Congregation, ed. David Rosenberg (New York: Har- court Brace Jovanovich, 1987), p. 108. 59.

The most salient parallels between the portrayals of Elijah and Elisha are conveniently summarized in Moshe Garsiel, The First Book of Samuel: A Literary Study of Comparative Structures, Analogies and Parallels (Hebrew ed., Ramat-Gan: Revivim Publishing House, 1983; English ed., 1985), p. 22 (Hebrew ed.). 61. 1 Samuel 24 and 26; cf.

GREENSTEIN In broad terms, the first deals with Judah and his sons, the second with David-traditionally Judah's greatest hero-and his sons.64 In each story the plot revolves around a woman named Tamar. In connection with each, two sons of the main protagonist die. In the end, two sons continue the story. The theme of the younger brother predominating over his elder brother figures in each.65 In both the abused woman Tamar never has sex again. As Blenkinsopp has observed, this is not the only Davidic association with Genesis 38.66 Judah married a bat ("daughter") of a Canaanite named Shua' (Gen. 38:2); her patronymic is, in an obviously contrived move, treat- ed below like a proper name, Bat-shua' (v. 12). David, of course, married the woman who would be the queen-mother, Bat-sheva'. In 1 Chron. 3:5 the same woman is called Bat-shua'! As Blenkinsopp further notes, tying together the two women: "Both [Tamars] are later vindicated at a sheep- shearing festival and both Bath-shuas lose their first child."67 There is far too much coincidence to regard the two narratives as autonomous.68 The parallels between Israel's eponymous patriarch Jacob/Israel and 438-446. On the basis of several parallels, Rendsburg proposes that Genesis 38 was composed shortly after David's own lifetime as a satirical political allegory of David and his family. Sever- al of the alleged parallels are not nearly as specific and precise as Rendsburg would like, however; the refusal of Onan to produce a son through Tamar in Genesis 38 is hardly compara- ble to the rape of David's daughter Tamar by Amnon, to take only one example. It therefore makes much more sense to me to understand the occasional parallels between the stories of Judah and David as the product of later, vague recollections of traditional stories about David; see further below. For similarities between Judah's unwitting liaison with Tamar en route to Timnah and Samson's pursuit of the woman from Timnah, see Yair Zakovitch, H.ayyeishimshon [The life of Samson] (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1982), p. 93. 64. Loren R. Fisher, "The Patriarchal Cycles," Alter Orient und altes Testament 22 (1973) [Cyrus H. Gordon Festschrift], pp. 59-65, at p. 64, suggests that Genesis 38 originally began a Judean epic about David. 65. Cf. Fisher, loc. cit. 66.

A coincidence less central to the action of the stories, but a specific parallel between Judah and David nonetheless, is that Genesis 38 begins by observing, gratuitously it would seem, that Judah "went down from his brothers and turned to [camped by?] an Adullamite man" (v. 1) and that David sought refuge from Achish in the Cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22:1). "His brothers," the text continues, " . . . went down to him there."</page><page sequence="17">FORMATION OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE CORPUS 167 David are more far-reaching.69 I shall discuss an additional example in detail below, but let me mention a few others briefly here. Jacob's eldest son, Reuben, slept with his concubine, Bilhah (Gen. 35:22), as David's oldest surviving son, Absalom, slept with his concubines (2 Sam. 16:22). The con- frontation between Jacob and his blood-rival, Esau, as well as the clash between David and his blood-rival, Absalom, both take place at the same location, Mahanaim. Both Jacob and David must flee and live away from home before returning in triumph.70 Jacob's son Joseph is ambushed by his brothers out where they are tending their sheep; and David's son Absalom is assassinated out in the field, as the sheep are shorn. On account of explicit hatred, Joseph's brothers would not speak to their uppity brother (Gen. 37:4), and Amnon's seething brother Absalom would not speak to him (2 Sam. 13:22). The fratricide of Amnon by Absalom's henchmen, as others have noted, resembles in both its paradigmatic action and some of its terminology the primeval murder of Abel by Cain.7' The Woman of Tekoa's parable about the murder (2 Sam. 14:6) locates the crime, as Gen. 4:8 does, in the "field" (sade). The aspect of the Amnon-Absalom episode in which a brother takes revenge for the rape of his sister also has a parallel in Genesis-the ven- geance of Simon and Levi on Shechem for the rape of their sister Dinah (Genesis 34).72 Again, David's story runs along the same lines as that of Jacob. 69. For a summary of parallels between Joseph and David, cf. Garsiel, First Book of Samuel, p. 131. For a rather idiosyncratic but provocative reading of Genesis and the succeed- ing books as a parabolic representation of monarchic "interests and institutions," see Shammai Feldman, "Biblical Motives and Sources," Journal of Near Eastern Studies 22 (1962): 73-103. Few of the comparisons I discuss are found there. 70. For details and parallels with the second-millennium stories of Idrimi of Alalakh and the Egyptian Sinuhe, see Edward L.

GREENSTEIN Leaving David for the present, Mazar has noted that several stories in Judges appear to be variant accounts of stories in Genesis.73 Both Genesis 34, for example, and Judges 9 deal with the Israelite takeover of Shechem. Zakovitch has delineated the parallels between the angel's appearance to Gideon in Judges 6 and the theophany to Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 18.74 They include the phrase 'im na' mava'ti hen be'enekha, "If I find favor in your eyes" (Gen. 18:3, Judg. 6:17); a request that the visitor stay and eat; the visitor's acceptance of the invitation; service of a meat meal under a tree (Gen. 18:8, Judg. 6:19). The Gideon story also has clear associations with Jacob's struggle at the Jabbok75 and the appearance of "the man of God" to Samson's parents in Judges 13,76 and the dialogue between Abraham and Sarah and the divine visitor(s) in Genesis 18 crops up again in the story of Elisha and the woman from Shunem (2 Kings 4). In both these latter narra- tives a desperate woman is promised a son following an act of hospitality. In both the woman waits hopefully in the entrance (petab; Gen. 18:10, 2 Kings 4:15). Both women react incredulously-Sarah doubles the earlier behavior of her husband by laughing (Gen. 18:12; cf. 17:17), and the Shunammite suspects the prophet may be teasing her (2 Kings 4:16). Both women are told they will give birth in one year (ka'et bayya,; Gen. 18:10, 2 Kings 4:16-17). In each story the narrative thread is picked up when the boy has grown (Gen. 21:8, 2 Kings 4:18). Between Genesis and Judges one also finds two 73. Benjamin Mazar, "The Historical Background of the Book of Genesis," Journal of Near Eastern Studies 28 (1969): 73-83. 74.

In his recent doctoral thesis on a dual reading of the Jacob and Gideon stories (Jewish Theological Seminary, 1988), my student Amnon Shapira delineates numerous striking paral- lels between Jacob and Gideon. Among them are these: both have seventy offspring, described as yose'e yerekho, "coming out of his loins [lit., thigh]" (Gen. 46:26, Judg. 8:30); both are younger/est brothers-the ?a'ir (Gen. 25:23, Judg. 6:15); both built proper altars and removed a pagan idol/altar (Gen. 35:2-4, Judg. 6:24-25); both encounter God/an angel of God "face to face" (panim 'el panim; Gen. 32:31, Judg. 6:22); Jacob hides pagan idols "under the oak" (Gen. 35:4), while Gideon experiences a theophany "under the oak" (Judg. 6:11; cf. v. 19); Jacob moved on from Penuel (Gen. 32:32) to Sukkoth (33:17), precisely the provenance of the men Gideon vanquished in Judges 8 (see esp. vv. 8, 16-17; and cf. now Robert Alter, "Language as Theme in the Book of Judges" [published lecture of the Judaic Studies Program, University of Cincinnati, 1988], pp. 3-4); the alternative names of both have similar etymologies in the text- Yisra'el.

Their language is remarkably alike. Yet some of the common phrases occur in different places in the story. The shared phrases do not correspond with the plot in a one-to-one fashion. We are not, it would seem, then, dealing merely with a shared story- pattern or type-scene.79 Niditch has suggested that the Genesis story was secondarily derived from Judges 19 because the former is "self-contained" and the latter is organic within its surrounding literary context.8" We are, at the very least, dealing with two variations of what was once the same story, or a "family" of stories stemming from the same basic treasury of tales.

One may further support the literary dependency of Genesis 19 on Judges 19 by noting that the expres- sion "do what is good in your eyes" is far more poignant in Judges, where Israel's lawlessness is emblematized by the phrase "each man would do what is right in his [own] eyes" (Judg. 17:6, 21:25); cf. on this point Stuart Lasine, "Guest and Host in Judges 19: Lot's Hospitality in an Inverted World," Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 29 (1984): 37-54, esp. 40-41. Lasine reviews the controversy over which passage is chronologically prior and then argues from a literary perspective that the Judges story in its present context "depends" on the Genesis story in order to parody it. Lasine makes clear, however, that his synchronic treatment does not decide the historical issue: "By 'literary dependence' I mean that Judges 19 presupposes the reader's awareness of Genesis 19 in its present form" (p. 38). Similarly, when Edmund Leach, "Anthropological Approaches to the Study of the Bible during the Twentieth Century," in Leach and D. Alan Aycock, Structuralist Interpretations of Biblical Myth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), pp. 7-32, at p. 27, states that Judges 19 "is a direct copy of the story of Lot in Sodom," he refers to the impression of the reader encountering the final form of the text synchronically. As he says below and elsewhere, he takes biblical stories "at the same time without consideration of the order in which they appear" (p. 29).</page><page sequence="21">FORMATION OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE CORPUS 171 are more alike than the plot."' Jeroboam I of Israel had two sons, Abiyah and Nadab. The former died of illness in vicarious punishment of his father's religious policy (1 Kings 14:1-18); the latter died in a coup at the hands of Baasha for following his father's policy (1 Kings 15:25-28). The death of Jeroboam's two sons in fairly rapid succession recalls, as Gradwohl has observed, the explosive death of Aaron's two sons in Leviticus 10.82 The fact that the latter are named Nadab and Abihu can hardly be coincidence. Clarifying the literary relationship between these two diverse yet connected stories poses a challenge that must be met in trying to trace the history of the biblical prose corpus. These narratives also represent a phenomenon one might term a "drift" of personal names between the Torah and the Former Prophets. Another example is the priestly character Phineas. In the Torah he is the zealous son of the priest Eleazar, bringing death to Midianites (Num. 25:7-8, 31:6 ff.). In 1 Samuel he is a corrupt son of the priest of Shiloh, Eli. One wonders whether it is pure coincidence that the priest who succeeds Eli's two corrupt sons is also called Eleazar.83 The coincidence is compounded when one notices that this Eleazar was the son of one Abinadab. In the Torah Eleazar became priest instead of his late older brothers Abihu and Nadab- whose names when conflated produce Abinadab!84 Between the stories of Eli and Aaron, then, one finds both a similar sequence of names and a roughly common plot-the chief priest's two (eldest) sons are not fit to serve in his place, so the priesthood moves outside the normal chain of succes- sion.85 More often, of course, the names change but the stories repeat. Some- times this is obvious, as in the parallelism between Elijah's flight to Horeb in 81. It is possible that when we encounter similat proper names or identical extensive dis- course (e.g., Exod. 32:4 and 1 Kings 12:28), we are dealing with compositional techniques employed in order to link narratives. However, as I have indicated above, I see no way to decide whether such matters of style reflect authorial intention or a common literary or tradi- tional source. 82.

GREENSTEIN 1 Kings 19 and Moses' revelation experience on Horeb/Sinai.86 Similarly, Joshua recapitulates many episodes and motifs from the story of Moses: he mediates God's commands, sends out spies, ceremoniously leads the Israel- ites across the Jordan-which Josh. 4:23 explicitly compares to the crossing of the sea under Moses, encounters an angel in a manner reminiscent of the burning bush theophany to Moses (see Josh. 5:13-15 and compare Exod. 3:5), suffers the Israelites' complaints (Josh. 7:7), and holds out his spear in taking Ha-ai (Josh. 8:26) as Moses had held up his arms (with a little help from his friends) at the battle with Amalek (Exod. 17:12).87 Synchronically, the parallels present Joshua, and then Elijah, in line with the figure of the great Moses. From a historical standpoint, however, we should not assume that the stories originated in connection with Moses. We shall return to this issue below. At this juncture I would like to illustrate an instance in which a narrative parallel is at first blush not so obvious. Nevertheless, it is for its greater subtlety perhaps even more suggestive. The extraordinary episode in Gene- sis 14 in which Abraham wars against an international military alliance bears several resemblances to the somewhat less distinguished battle fought by Joshua in chapter 10.88 In both cases the hero enters the fray against a group of four/five kings in aiding another party-Lot in Genesis, the Gibeonites in Joshua. After Abraham's victory, he is met by the king of Salem, Melchizedek (Gen. 14:18). Is it pure coincidence that one of Joshua's 86.

In Gen. 14:13 Abraham dwells in Elone Mamre, which Gen. 13:18 locates in Hebron. Another of Joshua's adversaries is the king of Hebron. Similar names crop up in similar narratives. The two texts describe the warfare in similar terms, too; compare Josh. 10:9-10 with Gen. 14:15: wayyavo' 'alehem.. . kol hallayla... wayyakkem ... wayyirdefem ... He came upon them ... all night ... he smote them ... and he pursued them ... wayyehaleq 'alehem layla ... wayyakkem wayyirdefem ... He divided against them by night . . . he smote them ... and he pursued them ... In Gen. 14:10 the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee (wayyanusu) while the others take flight (nasu) to the mountains; in Josh. 10:16 the five hostile kings flee (wayyanusu) and hide in a cave. It is plausible that we are dealing here with superficial similarities of style and historiographic method alone. But Josh. 10:11 says that "YHWH threw down on them large stones from the sky." Although there is no parallel to this line in Genesis 14, there is a striking parallel in the next Abraham-related story about the city of Sodom. There we read in Gen. 19:24: "YHWH rained down on Sodom ... sulphur and fire ... from the sky." The constellation of details shared between the conflict of Joshua and the Abraham-Sodom-warfare connection may result from more than common style; they may somehow be associated on the tree of Hebrew narrative tradition. One may speculate that there once were in Israel certain well-known historical narratives whose "wires" got crossed in the course of their transmission. The elements of the traditional stories were jumbled, recombined, and transfigured to produce new narratives. For my last case study, I turn to another pair of stories concerning Jacob and David. Although overall their plots are substantially different, they share a large number of motifs and locations in common.89 The stories treat the marriage of Jacob to two daughters of Laban and that of David to two daughters of Saul. In each narrative there is love between the protagonist and the younger daughter, who is (at least for a long time) barren. Each 89.

In each the younger daughter handles the teraphim. Here are most of the main parallels: Jacob "Laban had two daughters. The elder's (gedola) name was Leah" (Gen. 29:16). "Jacob loved Rachel" (v. 18). Jacob worked seven years for Rachel (v. 18). "I would rather give her to you than give her to another man" (v. 19). Laban substituted Leah for Rachel (v. 25). hava 'et 'ishti ki male'u yamay (v. 21) "Hand over my wife, for my time has been filled." "Have I not worked with you for Rachel? So why have you deceived me (welama rimmitani)? (v. 25). "But Rachel was barren" (v. 31). "Rachel stole the teraphim" (31:19). David "Here is my daughter, the elder one (haggedola), Merab" (1 Sam. 18:17). "Michal, daughter of Saul, loved David.. ." (v. 20). David must pay 100 Philistine foreskins for Michal (v. 25).90 "To you I give her as wife" (v. 17). Saul had already given Michal to another husband (v. 19). ... welo' male'u hayyamim (v. 26) "The time had not been filled . . ." "Saul said to Michal: Why have you thus deceived me (lama ... rimmitini)?" (19:17) "But Michal, daughter of Saul, had no offspring until the day of her death" (2 Sam. 6:23).91' "Michal took the teraphim" (1 Sam. 19:13). 90. Damrosch, Narrative Covenant, pp. 200-201, draws a parallel between the trap Saul thought he was setting for David by demanding Philistine foreskins and the stratagem Simon and Levi used against the men of Shechem by demanding that they circumcise themselves. 91. Prof. Shemaryahu Talmon has pointed out to me that, strictly speaking, there is a thematic difference in biblical narrative between (temporary) barrenness and the curse of child- lessness. On account of the culmulative evidence in support of the parallel between Rachel and Michal, however, I feel that the former's barrenness and the latter's childlessness are sufficient- ly comparable.</page><page sequence="25">FORMATION OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE CORPUS 175 "He [Jacob] fled (wayyivrab)-he and all He [David] went and fled (wayyivrab) who were with him" (v. 21). and escaped" (v. 12). "It was reported to Laban ... that "It was reported to Saul: Here, David is Jacob had fled" (v. 22). at Naioth, in Ramah" (v. 19). The common elements appear in often widely divergent sequences; accord- ingly, we do not have here two variations of a single type-scene. Yet we have far more than similarity in style. A theory of the origins of the narratives in the biblical corpus must account for a complex literary relationship such as this, in which fully worked out narratives with fundamentally different plots incorporate a large number of common motifs, character-relations, and wording. Stories such as the Jacob-Rachel and David-Michal narratives can hardly be attributed straightforwardly to different redactions of a single tradition, as in the documentary model. Nor is it credible that we find here two variations of a single orally transmitted tale. The action sequences are far too different. We might have two different combinations of conventional formulas, such as we encounter in epics. But that would not account for the specific and unique relationship that obtains between these two stories. I imagine a different history to these and many of the other story pairs we have identified between the Torah-and Genesis in particular-and the so-called Deuteronomistic History. I cannot say where all the narratives came from-no one could. We possess so little historical documentation. But I do suspect that there arose in ancient Israel various stories concerning the early kings, David of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel in particular. Elements of their stories served as the material of later narrators and writers. Some of these elements became recombined into new sequences; others became transformed through substitutions in details and other modifica- tions. Thus, for example, the prophecy about the gruesome death of Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:7 ff.) was transferred, in slightly different form, to the declaration of doom to Ahab (1 Kings 21:19 ff.).92 More radically, the Judean perspective on Jeroboam's golden calves was shifted to shape the 92.

GREENSTEIN story of Aaron and the golden calf in Exodus 32.93 We have already noted the striking correspondence between Jeroboam's sons and Aaron's (Nadab and Abihu). The narratives concerning the patriarchs, like those told directly about the kings, seem to me-and many others, of course-to refer somehow to international relations and inner-Israelite affairs.94 Several scholars have observed that the narrative of David intertwines the personal and the politi- cal stories within a Hebrew theological framework.95 The little episode in which the five "daughters" of Zelofhad inherit his property and establish a legal precedent (Num. 27:1-11) is a more obvious example of a sociopoliti- cal plot in the guise of a domestic tale. We know from the Samaria ostraca and would surmise anyway from other biblical passages that these daughters represent towns in an area of Manasseh.96 Had we sufficient documentation, we might find that a rather large proportion of biblical narrative is, as Joel Rosenberg suggests,97 political allegory. Wellhausen had suggested something akin to the model by which I imagine the earliest narratives in our biblical corpus were composed. 93. Cf., e.g., Damrosch, Narrative Covenant, pp. 268 ff. Brevard S. Childs, The Book of Exodus (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1974), pp. 559-561, maintains that "the Deuteron- omic editor of I Kings 12 ... was dependent on an existing story which he adjusted to suit his later polemic against Jeroboam" (p. 560). 94. Cf., e.g., Gunkel, Legends of Genesis; North, "Pentateuchal Criticism," adducing the work of J. Pedersen; Feldman, "Biblical Motives and Sources"; Wagner, "Abraham and David?" 95. Cf., e.g., Leach, Genesis as Myth and Other Essays, pp. 25-83; Joel Rosenberg, "I and II Samuel," in The Literary Guide to the Bible, ed. Robert Alter and Frank Kermode (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 122-145. 96. Cf., e.g., Martin Noth, Die israelitischen Personnamen im Rahmen der gemeinsemitisch- en Namengebung (Hildesheim: Georg Ohms, 1966; first published: Stuttgart, 1928), p. 242; see further Aaron Demsky, "The Genealogies of Manasseh and the Location of the Territory of Milcah Daughter of Zelophehad," Eretz-Israel 16 (1982): 70-75 [in Hebrew]. The Samaria ostraca attest the receipt/dispatch of merchandise from/to the localities of Hoglah and Noah, two of Zelofhad's "daughters." Scholars tend to view Hoglah, Noah, and the rest not as place- names but as designations of clans; cf., e.g., Yohanan Aharoni, The Land of the Bible, trans. A. F. Rainey, rev. ed. (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1979), p. 363. "Daughter," however, is, as is well known, the specific term for a town or village in the vicinity of a large town or city (e.g., Judg. 1:27). Moreover, Tirzah, the fifth "sister," is clearly a place-name-the royal residence of the early North Israelite kings (cf., e.g., 1 Kings 14:17; 15:21, 33; 16:8, 15, 23). Consequently, the "daughters" in all likelihood represent toponyms. 97. Joel Rosenberg, King and Kin: Political Allegory in the Hebrew Bible (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986).

Even at the first act of reducing it to writing the discoloring influences are at work, without any violence being done to the meaning which dwells in the matter."9 I would place the source of the primary legends as we now find them in the early monarchy. The reasons that I do not view the patriarchal and other Pentateuchal narratives as primary are largely traditio-historical.99 That is, among the earliest Hebrew writings in the Bible that we can date with much confidence, the so-called classical prophecies of the eighth and seventh cen- turies B.C.E. seem to know the following traditions: the catastrophic destruc- tion of Sodom and Gomorrah (Hos. 11:8, Amos 4:11, Isa. 1:9, Zeph. 2:9); the exodus and sojourn in the wilderness (Hos. 2:7; Amos 2:10, 3:1; Isa. I1:16; Mic. 6:4-5); and the struggle between Jacob and Esau (Hos. 12:4-5, 13). Even the archaic poems such as Judges 5 and Exodus 15 add little to those traditions, only the march of YHWH and his people from the south and the occupation of Canaan.0oo Abraham is attested only in Judean texts from the period after the fall of the North (Isa. 29:22, Mic. 7:20, Jer. 33:26, and cf. the exilic texts Ezek. 33:24; Isa. 41:8, 51:1-3, 63:16). Seeing the patriarchal narratives as derivative might also explain the high incidence of doublets and type-scenes within them.'0' Sometime during the centuries from David until the Babylonian exile, the narrative corpus was formed. As I said above, I imagine the Josianic era as a suitable period for the composi- tion of most of the narratives as we have them.102 Because of the complexity of the corpus I could not with confidence develop a more precise and intri- cate reconstruction of the overall literary history. A flexible combination of models would seem to be in order. Yet the general pattern I have sketched 98.

This repetition of scenes has been noted, albeit in a different formulation, by Fisher, "Patriarchal Cycles." 102. Seeing as the narratives seem to include material from the North, which had been overrun by Assyria in 722 B.C.E., it is equally probable that King Hezekiah had begun the pro- cess of assembling and writing down traditional narratives, as well as composing new ones; cf., e.g., Ginsberg, Israelian Heritage of Judaism, esp. pp. 34-38; Yeivin, "Hagigim 'al zeman libburam shel sifre nevi'im rishonim."</page><page sequence="28">178 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN does account for the salient feature of the narratives I underscored above: the same names, motifs, language, and plots get recycled in various con- figurations. This is not the place to dwell on the aesthetic side of the biblical narrative corpus. I have defined my object here as the reconstruction of the literary history of the biblical narrative rather than an assessment and analysis of what it means. Let me content myself by saying that most of the stories that have been preserved and melded into a continuous, coherent tale have, by virtue of their drama and their reflection of popular concerns and anx- ieties,'03 become not only the authoritative accounting to the Hebrews or Judeans of their own history; they have become the core myth of a civiliza- tion two and a half millennia old.
