Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. xiii, 379 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000608 The anthropology of Jews and Judaism has, of late, emerged as a recognized force in two disciplinary domains. From the anthropological side, Jewish ethno graphic objects have been introduced into the mainstream of contemporary theori zation at an unprecedented pace. By any measure?academic positions, scholarly output, or institutional support?professional anthropology has made room for, and has been increasingly informed by, practitioners working on Jewish topics. Meanwhile, Jewish studies, with its burgeoning interdisciplinary sophistication, has over the past several decades welcomed anthropological methodologies and analytics that previously appeared to cut against the grain of a philologically oriented field. Evidence of this synthesis can be found, among other places, in flag ship journals, this one included, that now regularly publish research at the nexus of anthropology and Jewish studies. Harvey Goldberg's Jewish Passages: Cycles of Jewish Life is both an index of and a guide to this productive intersection. Jewish Passages provides a critical survey, for both researchers and what Goldberg calls "engaged Jews," of formative and recent developments in the anthropology of Judaism. As the book demon strates, this anthropology has been situated in the dialectic between fine-grained ethnographic studies of single communities and comparative analysis both across Jewish contexts and beyond them. The numerous case studies that provide the book's foundation demonstrate how Jewish religious phenomena have been sifted through classic anthropological formulations of alliance theory, socialization, symbolic multivocality, ethnicity, communitas, and the like. At the same time, Goldberg is as likely to compare Jewish circumcision in Tunisia and the United States as he is to compare brit milah with its African equivalents. For scholars, the book's rigorous documentation and bibliographical rich ness will make it a standard reference on Judaic practice, the anthropology of Judaism, and comparative Jewish studies. For engaged Jews, the book can be read straight through as a sustained argument about how best to appreciate the diversity of Judaic practice, or it can be read piecemeal as a series of snapshots capturing elements of that diversity across time and space. 370</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews More than simply providing a survey of Jewish belief and ritual in its varied historical and cultural contexts, Goldberg offers a sustained commentary on how such diversity challenges essentialist evaluations of Jewishness (defined in racial, ethnic, or religious terms) without, however, deferring all attempts to constitute Judaism as an encompassing frame of experience or object of analysis. If this book is taken as a response to the hoary question of whether it is more useful to speak of Judaism or Judaisms, Goldberg's response is that neither alternative is quite on the mark. The author deftly demonstrates that Judaism cannot be reduced to a set of unchanging or exclusive ideological tenets, canonical texts, or stable rituals. Nor, however, can Judaism be made into anything one wishes. Rather, what constitutes Judaism as an integral category, subject, for example, to the kind of comprehensive treatment that Goldberg provides, are the varied and his torically situated relationships between ideologies, texts, and rituals. If this insight is by now conventional wisdom, at least among some academic scholars and engaged Jews, Goldberg's relentless emphasis on Judaic diversity as the product of contex tual and relational histories provides a compelling synthesis of this approach. Goldberg's comparative emphasis on Judaic diversity is balanced by an atten tiveness to what the author calls the integrity of Judaic texts themselves. As Gold berg notes, the set of authoritative Jewish texts is not infinite, nor are such texts blank slates on which any interpretation can be compellingly imposed. As such, Judaic experience emerges in the dynamic interplay between texts (with their par ticular formal properties, discursive content, and hermeneutic imperatives) and inter pretive practices (which are neither entirely independent of nor entirely determined by the texts to which they refer). Indeed, this interplay is captured in the very archi tecture of Jewish Passages, which is composed as a series of chapters organized around life-cycle events, from birth (Chap. 2), through education (Chap. 3) and mar riage (Chap. 4), to death (Chap. 6). As Goldberg points out, the notion of the life cycle is itself of relatively recent origin, crystallized theoretically by modem anthro pology and resonant with the liberal individualism that so informs mainstream American Judaism. That a life-cycle approach to Judaism has emerged as obvious has everything to do with modernity and little to do with the organizational logic of biblical narrative or rabbinic exegesis. Yet Goldberg equally notes that the inter pretative work required to turn Judaism into a life-cycle-oriented tradition is not completely foreclosed by biblical and rabbinic texts, which, of course, attend to circumcision, education, marriage, death, and so on. The way in which Goldberg structures his core chapters further indicates how he approaches his task as a guide to Judaic diversity. Each chapter begins with an ethnographic anecdote that illustrates the centrality of life-cycle events in contem porary, and primarily American and Israeli, Jewish communities. Next, Goldberg traces the biblical and rabbinic sources that have been brought to bear in the justi fication, interpretation, and expression of Jewish life-cycle rituals. At one level, these sections are instructive insofar as they provide an annotated index of those canonical texts on which Jews have relied to legitimate, explain, and construct prac tical life-cycle enactments. At another level, Goldberg approaches these texts as evidence of their original social and cultural contexts. In this latter endeavor, Goldberg demonstrates how social and cultural historical analysis has been 371</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews informed by anthropological theory, thus pushing the methodological boundaries of Jewish studies. Each chapter proceeds chronologically from early canonical texts, through medieval and early modem examples, and finally to contemporary elaborations. Goldberg's chronological and historicizing strategy has the important effect of dis pelling any presumption that Judaic practice is stable or that contemporary Judaic expression is the natural culmination of teleological developments. This strategy also allows Goldberg to introduce the ways in which entire domains of Judaic practice?saint veneration and pilgrimage, for example (Chap. 5)?have been crucial to Jewish life in many communities. As Goldberg demonstrates, the once common impulse to relegate such beliefs and practices to superstition or folklore fails to account for the textual foundations, historical genealogies, and contemporary strategies that make saints and pilgrimage resolutely Judaic in form and content. Goldberg concludes with a frank challenge to the ways in which "each Jewish group grows complacent in the rectitude of its own habits," and he offers Jewish Passages as "an antidote to insularity" (273). This framing attests to one of the great tensions of Jewish cultural history, namely, the tension between the parochi alism of local communities and the cosmopolitanism of world Judaism. The fact that there is an engaged Jewish readership for Goldberg to imagine is one expression of this tension. While such a readership is apparently insular enough to benefit from the lesson in Jewish diversity Goldberg offers, this same readership is worldly enough to be interested in the instruction. For engaged Jews, Goldberg is an able teacher who pushes limits of familiarity but remains within established frames of sociological liberalism. Thus, for example, Goldberg treats modernity primarily as the most recent move in the perpetual historical interplay between indi vidual and community. Such treatment may not fully represent current directions in critical Jewish ethnography and history?currents that call into question the very categories of "individual," "community," and "modernity"?but this is no serious weakness. To the contrary, by so masterfully tracing the points at which anthropol ogy and Jewish studies have been meeting, Jewish Passages also exposes analytical terrain that has yet to be fully explored.
