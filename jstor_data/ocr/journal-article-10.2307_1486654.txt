<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM: A REAPPRAISAL OF RABBI A. I. KOOK'S ESPOUSAL OF TOLERATION by TAMAR ROSS Much has been said and written about the unique position regarding toleration that was adopted by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook.' Its uniqueness within Jewish tradition is not open to doubt. The question I would like to explore here is the extent to which his version of toleration is compatible with the toleration that has become part of the modern secular outlook. In order to accomplish this task, I begin by setting up a typology of two basic varieties of toleration, relating one to the skepticism of the relativist who espouses liberal pluralism, and the other to religious systems with absolutist claims for truth. In the second part of the article, a sketch of the history of toleration in Judaism, this typology is confirmed. The third part of the article is a review of R. Kook's notion of toleration, which seems at first to conform to the type of toleration generally associated with liberalism, but, when translated into practical policy, displays some significant aberrations.

The fifth part is an exposition of the peculiarly religious version of epistemological relativism that sustains R. Kook's position. The sixth part discusses the criteria for practical policy that follow from this epistemological view, when compounded by R. Kook's views of nationalism and the nature of religious belief in the messianic age, and demonstrates the resultant divergence from more radical versions of individualist pluralism. The seventh and final part contends that R. Kook's version of toleration tends more toward a communitarian ideal of society but that even this compatibility is limited. The discussion concludes with an assessment of what nevertheless does constitute an original attempt at rapprochement with the phenomenon of modern secular pluralism. 1. Typology of Toleration Prudential Toleration and Ideological Toleration The virtue of toleration has become one of the central tenets of modem Western society. Disputing its value has come to be regarded as tantamount to opposing mother's milk and apple pie. But "toleration" often serves as a catch-all title for a wide variety of positions. In order to understand the precise nature of each of these, and the extent to which they are related, it would be worthwhile to first take a hard look at the notion of toleration in general, and its relationship to pluralism, paternalism, and relativism in particular. These terms are often used interchangeably, thus stringing together a cluster of related but disparate ideas. Introducing a few initial observations and distinctions would make it possible to avoid some of the conceptual confusions and ambiguities reflected in the everyday usage of these terms, and prevent muddiness when drawing comparisons.2 2. I owe special thanks to Avi Sagie, who at the eleventh hour of my writing kindly shared with me the manuscript of his forthcoming article, "The Jewish Religion: Toleration and the</page><page sequence="3">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 63 The first point to be noted3 is that any notion of toleration necessarily involves both a positive and a negative response to its object. The positive element consists of a willingness to endure, or put up with, that object. The negative element is the fact that this willingness must be half-hearted in some sense, and accompanied by an underlying wish that things were different. But there are varying degrees of acceptance or disapproval. One method of distinguishing between different varieties of toleration is to establish the relative weight of the positive and negative attitudes involved. Toleration is exhibited in its purest sense when the two responses are equally strong, thus rendering the level of tension between them at its most intense. In ordinary discourse, however, toleration is sometimes understood in a very mild sense, when the tension is much weaker. This weakness is exhibited when either the positive or the negative response is appreciably more dominant. This is what occurs, for example, on one end of the scale, when what passes for toleration is really lack of option, i.e., a position of complete powerlessness to alter an undesirable situation or to prevent or hinder something hated, which perforce must be endured. At the other end of the scale is lack of objection (whose opponents would claim it to be merely a cover for moral weakness);4 i.e., an attitude of indifference to the fact that people think and act in a variety of conflicting ways. The former position is closer to intolerance than to toleration, because the positive element of acceptance would disappear the moment that this was possible. The latter position hardly qualifies as toleration at all, because the negative element, to the extent it exists, stems simply from any inconvenience or practical difficulty entailed in making space for lifestyles or matters of taste that differ from our own, thus shading into the position of the radical anarchist, for whom all opinions are equally valid. Situated between the grudging endurance of the powerless (which we shall label Position 1) and the neutrality or indifference of the anarchist (which we shall label Position 4) lie at least two intermediate levels, both Possibility of Pluralism." His elegantly drawn apparatus helped me to sharpen and amplify upon some of my own distinctions, which are similar to his, but allow for greater overlap between pluralism and toleration. 3. As has been done by Jay Newman, "The Idea of Religious Tolerance," American Philosophical Quarterly 15, no. 3 (July 1978): 187, and by P. F. Strawson, Freedom and Resentment (London: Methuen, 1974), chap. 4: "The Limits of Toleration," p. 43. 4. See Newman, "Idea of Religious Tolerance," p. 194.</page><page sequence="4">64 TAMAR ROSS of which qualify more accurately as bona fide varieties of toleration. In the context of political discussions, these levels have been loosely characterized as "maximalist" and "minimalist" varieties of liberalism.5 The criteria for distinguishing between these two positions relate to the relative degree in which they embrace pluralism (i.e., the promotion of a wide variety of alternatives-ideas, values, or lifestyles) as an intrinsic value. This difference exhibits itself either in the motive for toleration, the object of toleration, or the extent of self-restraint mandated (or, conversely, the degree of interference condoned). Motive. The different motives of Positions 2 and 3 can be characterized as prudential or ideological.6 Position 2 is moved by prudential considerations that are either tactical or realistic. The tactical tolerator does not view pluralism as a necessary, valuable, or permanent feature of life. His toleration for rival options is sustained only by the recognition that the lack of plurality born of coercion sometimes boomerangs and generates opposition rather than agreement. He is therefore moved to hope that a nonrepressive atmosphere, rather than attitudes of total rejection, will prove more effective pragmatically as a strategy of persuasion toward the single desired view. Very often this hope slips into a mode of paternalism that does not qualify as toleration at all, because it refuses to view dissident positions as a genuine difference of opinion, thereby eliminating the tension between positive and negative elements of response. 5. For a more elaborate explication of these two models of toleration and the respective philosophical and political difficulties they engender when forming the basis for practical policy, see Herbert Marcuse, "Repressive Tolerance," in A Critique of Pure Tolerance, ed. R. P. Wolff, B. Moore Jr., and H. Marcuse (Boston: Beacon Press, 1969), pp. 81-123; W. Kendall, "The 'Open Society' and Its Fallacies," American Political Science Review 54 (1960): 972-979; David Lewis, "Mill and Milquetoast," Australasian Journal of Philosophy 67 (1989): 152-171; Karl Popper, "Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility," in On Toleration, ed. S. Mendus and D. Edwards (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), pp. 17-34; David Hed, "Two Concepts of Liberalism," in In the Labyrinth of Democracy, ed. Yuval Lurie and Hayim Maranz (Ben-Gurion University, 1990), pp. 169-184. The two versions of maximalism and minimalism have alternatively been described as thick or thin, rightist or leftist, individualistic or pluralistic, when applied not only to toleration as such, but also to the broader concept of liberalism as a form of government. 6. Although these motives are separate and distinct justifications for toleration, they are not always mutually exclusive. On the contrary, they may reinforce each other. See Susan Mendus's introduction to Mendus and Edwards, On Toleration, pp. 3-4. Mendus terms the three motives "prudence," "rationality," and "morality."</page><page sequence="5">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 65 Such fudging of differences is effected either by interpreting the tolerated opinion or value as essentially similar to one's own (or at any rate, not a contradiction of it), or by excusing its existence with the argument that it was assumed out of lack of understanding or true freedom of choice. The realistic tolerator accepts the need to make peace with the existence of pluralism as a phenomenon that is here to stay. He is moved to toleration by the recognition that if we are not prepared to put up with what is objectionable to us, there is little chance that others will reciprocate in kind, and not attempt to curtail our own freedom to behave as we wish. Position 3 is based on ideological considerations that are either philo- sophical or altruistic. The philosophical tolerator is moved by a regard for truth, out of the conviction that the philosophical interests of truth are best fostered in an atmosphere of freedom of thought, which includes the right of all people to express their own views-even when in our eyes these might be mistaken. Since human beings are fallible, it is only when we have the opportunity to engage in constant dialogue, contrasting and debating our views with those of others, that we can hope to refine and correct our own views. The altruistic tolerator is moved by the conviction that true regard for one's fellow-man is best expressed by protecting his inalienable right to decide autonomously. Every person is first and foremost an independent agent, born with a natural right to personal liberty. Every freely made choice has its own value, alongside that of others, either as an expression of individualism or because plurality of options is a necessary condition for human autonomy. Object of toleration. A second test and determinant of the variety of toleration involved is on the level of practical policy: what should we be tolerant of? Should toleration apply only to the bearer of the opinion and perhaps to his right to hold it, or should it extend even to the opinion itself? Extent of self-restraint mandated (or degree of interference condoned). A third criterion for classification belongs even more blatantly to the level of action. What reaction is strong enough to qualify as intolerant? Does the restraint from intervention that toleration entails stop only at physical coercion, or does it avoid all forms of legal or social sanction, including public declarations of censure, and attempts to battle even unspoken psychological attitudes of derision and contempt? May we engage in gentle or indirect persuasion, or must we refrain from pressure that interferes even subtly with freedom of choice? Must we ensure the right to a hearing of rival views,</page><page sequence="6">66 TAMAR ROSS their public expression, the proselytizing and inciting of others to act upon them, even by positive and explicit institutional provision? Or do we promote the "melting pot" phenomenon by encouraging the formation of as broad a consensus as possible, whitewashing the individual differences between minority groups? Toleration of the Position 2 variety for the bearer of an untenable opinion, and perhaps even for his right to hold it in private, could be based on con- siderations of personal respect, or at the very least on tactical considerations (such as the assessment that lack of overt interference is sometimes far more effective as a tactic of persuasion than outright opposition). At the same time, advocates of this position may still feel duty-bound to attempt to limit the right to express dissident views in public, to the extent that such resistance is possible and does not clash with the dictates of prudence.7 They would have no compunctions in principle regarding the exercise of indirect pressure (warning others, preventing harmful influences, publicizing declarations of disapproval), as it is precisely prudentialist calculations that would move a person in this camp to consider such measures. On the other hand, exponents of Position 3, in the interest of preserving pluralism, will exercise greater self-restraint. According to the ideological tolerator, the only theoretically legitimate justification for interfering with the expression of opinions is the one originally formulated by J. S. Mill, i.e., to prevent harm to others or to protect oneself. Because he welcomes pluralism as an intrinsic good, he will find it possible to adopt an accepting attitude not only toward the bearer of the dissident opinion, and its expression, but even toward the opinion itself, despite the fact that he does not share it. Relativism The different attitudes toward pluralism of the two versions of toleration are closely related to the degree of absoluteness or certitude that each attaches to its own truths or values. Position 1, like Position 2, is predicated on a belief in objective truths and absolute values. Position 3, on the other hand, assumes some form of relativism. In its milder form, the philosophic tolerator's interest 7. It is worth noting in this connection, however, that the distinction between holding and expressing an opinion is easily eroded if a person is not prepared to lie in response to direct questioning or to perform acts that are inconsistent with his private convictions. See Strawson, "Limits of Toleration," p. 46.</page><page sequence="7">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 67 in pluralism is based on skepticism regarding the ability of human beings to ever be certain of achieving absolute truth, even though it may exist. Here pluralism functions as a necessary means for coming closer to the truth, and not as an end in itself. In its stronger form, the second variant of Position 3, the willingness of the altruistic tolerator to place freedom of choice above truth is best understood against the background of an even less conclusive view of truth, which speaks only in terms of various ideal forms of life rather than mutually exclusive truths. Although even this variety of toleration may still be based on the assumption of human fallibilism,8 it is often skeptical not only about the ability of human beings to ever be certain of having achieved truth, but even about the very existence of truth, thus shading into the indifference of Position 4. Greater tentativeness of truth claims may be what lends credence to the altruist's stance that if someone sincerely believes something, there is no compelling reason to prevent him from acting upon it. Despite the relationship between the two varieties of toleration and their respective degrees of truth certitude, two further points are worth noting. First, neither prudential nor ideological motives are absolutely compelling indications for toleration, for the very same considerations can be used in order to reach the opposite conclusions. The prudentially intolerant could consider the very existence of a plurality of views as endangering the security of his own. The philosophically intolerant could be concerned for truth for its own sake, because the existence of falsity is so unbearable.9 The altruistically intolerant could be motivated by a paternalistic concern for the well-being of misguided fellow-beings. But it is the ideological variety of toleration, which bases its acceptance of pluralism on regard for truth, that rests on particularly precarious foundations, since it could be argued that this concept of toleration can never be legitimately applied to any position which claims to be absolutely established; as one philosopher has commented: "If one shares 8. Contrary to what is usually assumed, it is this version of intellectual skepticism that supports J. S. Mill's liberalism. Mill opposes the idea of public truth not because society must have freedom of speech, but for the same reason that it must have freedom of speech, i.e., an assault on one definitive truth. For Mill, skepticism and tolerance are integrally connected. He thinks our choice is either never to silence or to declare ourselves infallible. See Kendall, "Open Society," pp. 975-976; Strawson, "Limits of Toleration," p. 50. 9. Newman, "Idea of Religious Tolerance," pp. 190-191.</page><page sequence="8">68 TAMAR ROSS the position, it makes no sense to speak of tolerating it, and if one disagrees with it, then one is committed to its repudiation."'" The preceding reservation is quite germane to the discussion of religious beliefs, especially of the variety to be found in the accepted monotheistic religions, since these notoriously claim to be the absolute truth. Surely, toleration of opinion here would make no sense. In all of the monotheistic belief systems, the believer is moved by the conviction that his religion speaks in the name of an absolute truth already revealed by God. There appears to be no way that an adherent of one religion can "accept" or "endure" the errors of a rival religion (or anti-religion)." For this reason, it is tempting to conclude that ideological toleration of opinions, particularly of the theological variety, can only flourish in the liberal environment of secularism, which speaks in the name of relativism (i.e., that all beliefs are relative to a particular culture or time, and no one of them is to be preferred absolutely to any other). It can only make sense in an atmosphere where "opinions" are understood to be something weaker than statements of absolute truth.'" If this is so, then those 10. Strawson, "Limits of Toleration," p. 47. 11. For those who accept the Kantian criterion of universalizability, with the implied universality and absoluteness of moral principles, the impossibility of tolerance would apply here too. It has, however, been argued that one cannot draw a distinction between the moral and the nonmoral by contending that one is based on reason and the other on feeling. Morality itself is based on strong feelings, and the concept of morality would wither away and become lost in the concept of expediency if strong feelings or sentiment were not involved in the judgment that something is morally right or wrong. The conclusion is therefore drawn that no sharp line can be drawn between what I dislike and what I disapprove of. See Baroness Warnock's article, "The Limits of Toleration," chap. 7 in On Toleration, p. 126. However, Warnock also argues that there is no necessity to identify relativism (the belief that nothing is ultimately better or worse than anything else) with the belief that morality is based as much on feeling as reason, for some feelings may be better or more important (culturally, historically) than others. 12. According to R. M. Hare in Freedom and Reason (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), p. 177, "what distinguishes the liberal is that he respects the ideals of others as he does his own. This does not mean he agrees with them-that would be logically impossible if they are different from his." But if his and others' conflict, "he will-in arbitrating between people's interests and ideals, give as much weight to each person's as to any other's; he will not give his own ideals and interests preference because they are his own. It is only when somebody else's pursuit interferes with others' that this arbitration becomes necessary." But Hare then continues: "He does not claim finality for his own ideal, though he may be sure that it is the best that he has discovered so far. ... He may even think that a diversity of ideals is in itself a good thing, not only because people are different and what they are likely to achieve is different ... but also, because it takes all sorts to make a world" (p. 180).</page><page sequence="9">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 69 who speak unequivocally of toleration as a virtue must be referring only to some belief or doctrine which they regard as basically a matter of personal opinion, prejudice, feeling, inclination, or taste.'3 A legitimate counterargument that has been offered, however, is that most of the beliefs that we consider important are actually beliefs that involve practical application.14 As Strawson puts it, "Opinions do not arrive in the world ownerless and unparented. They come only attached to people, and are, moreover, seldom divorced from actions."' As such, they have repercussions that cannot be ignored. It is only at the most superficial level that religious belief can be taken as an abstract and metaphysical issue, without consequences in the real world. From the standpoint of religious believers (and disbelievers), it is not enough that their sincerely held beliefs should be permitted a hearing or that they should not be penalized for holding them; they must also be able to live by the precepts and customs of their religion or irreligion. Moral beliefs are also action-guiding rather than abstract, and political beliefs quite clearly cover a broad spectrum of action rather than opinion. Even in the search for scientific truth, the expression of an opinion cannot be separated from action. "Facts are not dumb clutter strewn meaninglessly about the attic of the world. In their selection, discussion, and bringing into focus, they are inevitably acted upon. They are used as stepping-stones to another level of inquiry and are inextricably intermeshed with action."'6 Thus, "there is ... a validity attached to the notion of toleration of opinion as a social phenomenon, attached to a person and issuing in action, that is missing from the notion of abstract opinion alone, stark and unembodied in a social context."" Even one who holds religious opinions with absolute claims to truth might still be able to make a distinction between the truth value of an opinion in its unembodied form and the value of the same opinion in its social application, and to be tolerant of opinions in the latter sense. Because 13. Thus, as Newman points out ("Idea of Religious Tolerance," p. 188), when toleration is applied to moral positions or to rational argument, the concept need not necessarily represent a normative ideal. A person may criticize himself or others for merely tolerating what calls for stronger approval or respect, or for even tolerating something that calls for stronger measures of disapproval and denunciation. 14.

Toleration in Jewish Sources Before Rabbi Kook Pluralism of Views But Rejection of Heresy In the light of all this, we are in a position to undertake an assessment of R. Kook's views regarding the room for toleration within a religious worldview. First it should be acknowledged that before R. Kook there already existed a long series of authoritative Jewish sources that affirmed the basic dignity of man in general, irrespective of race or religion, simply by virtue of the fact that all men were created in the image of God."8 There was also ample recognition of the legitimacy of pluralism in the realm of opinions, including the right to hold and express diverse views, as epitomized in the classic principle "Both these and these are the words of the living God" ('Elu ve-'elu divrei 'Elokim Hayim).'9 18. See 'Avot 3:18. For further amplification of this theme, see Aaron Lichtenstein, "The Dignity of Created Beings" (Hebrew), Mahanayinm 5 (May 1993): 8-16; Menahem 'Elon, "Freedom of Expression and the Control of Minority Rights in Jewish Law," ibid., pp. 28-30, pars. 5-6. See also TB Kritot 6b: "Every fast-day in which the sinners of Israel do not participate is not a true fast-day, as we see from the case of the helbena (galbanum), which has a bad smell but is included by Scripture (Exodus 30:34) among the ingredients to be included in the incense to be offered in the service of the sanctuary"; the theme is elaborated upon in Derashot Ha-ran (Nissim b. Reuven of Gerondi), edited by L. A. Feldman (Jerusalem, 1973), first derasha, pp. 3 ff. 19. For further amplification and sources, see 'Elon, "Freedom of Expression," pp. 25-26. A spirit of pluralism based on such sources surely animates the toleration of diversity in the realm of halakhic practice exemplified in such contemporary rulings as R. Moshe Feinstein's permitting the sale, during the year of shmita (the sabbatical year), of 'etrogint (citrons) produced in the framework of belief in heter nmekhirah (the possibility of "selling" the land of Israel in order to obviate its lying fallow) even to those who do not accept this heter, since there is no violation of "placing a stumbling block before the blind" regarding anything that is done in accordance with the decision of a sage until a Sanhedrin actually rules against it (Igrot Moshe, Orah Hayim, vol. 1, sec. 186). That is, it is recognized here that the fragmentation of religious authority allows for many opinions. Compare the Responsa Mishnat Yosef pt. 1, sec. 100. Another leading contemporary decisor, R. Eliezer Waldenberg, in his Responsa Tzitz Eliezer 12, pt. 16, sec. 3, forbids practicing a humra (stringent measure) which will shame</page><page sequence="11">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 71 All this applies only to opinions that could be construed as falling within the realm of normative Jewish belief and practice, or at any rate as not directly in conflict with it.20 It is certainly not applicable in the case of heresy, where the entire theoretical structure of halakhah is based on the principle of theocratic rule and the interventionist notion that every Jew is responsible for every other (Kol Yisrael 'arevim zeh la-zeh). As for infidels in general,21 and Jewish ones in particular, it would be safe to say that the general thrust of halakhah appears to be one of extreme intolerance toward their beliefs and opinions, as well toward their iight to hold dissident views and live by them. The usual rationale for regarding Jewish heretics, both socially and religiously, not as people with legitimate opinions worthy of respect, but as offenders and criminals who have absolutely no right to their views, was the inversely altruistic paternalistic assumption that every Jew naturally wants to observe mitzvot and refrain from transgressions. If he lapses, this is only because his evil inclination has succeeded in tempting him to behave otherwise. The coercion and intolerance, therefore, come to help rid him of the shackles of temptation, so that when he finally asserts "I wish this" (rotzeh 'ani), it certainly reflects his genuine will.22 Freedom is the ability to act in accordance with one's true desire, without any outside obstacles, and society someone else who does not keep the same stringency. He wrote this in response to a query regarding the practice of the saintly Hafetz Hayim, who behaved in this manner regarding the eating of nzatzah sheruyah (moistened unleavened bread) on Passover; the questioner asked whether he was obligated to perform a hatarat nedarinz (remission of vows) in this connection. 20. E.g., see R. Moshe Feinstein's ruling in his Igrot Moshe, Orah Hayim, vol. 1, sec. 46, that although the Israeli flag is a symbol of the state of the wicked heretics who deny Jewish tradition, there is no ban on it, for there is nothing against placing a secular object in the synagogue. Therefore, it is not worth creating a dispute over something which is not actually forbidden. In this case, the imprudence of divisiveness overrides the distaste for the dissident. One source that might be construed as extending the toleration principle even further is TB Menahot 27a, which compares the obligation to bind together the 'arba' minim (four species of plants blessed on Sukkot) to the obligation to bind together all types of Jews, which includes even the wicked among them. But the intent is most likely directed to tolerance of their persons, not of their wickedness per se. 21. E.g., see Maimonides' opinion in his Guide of the Perplexed, III, chap. 51, regarding the second class of people surrounding the palace in search of the king. Since they hold wrong opinions, sometimes they must be slain and all memory of their opinions destroyed, so that they will not mislead others. 22. Rambam, Hilkhot Gerushin 2:2. See also Yaron, Philosophy of R. Kook, p. 327, and especially n. 13.</page><page sequence="12">72 TAMAR ROSS must help all Jews to do so. On the face of it, intolerance in the extreme is the norm not only with regard to the sinner's opinions or his right to hold them, but even regarding the sinner himself. An instructive example can be found in the Talmud, where it is established as permissible to hate the perpetual sinner (the rasha'), and that doing so is even a mitzvah.23 Categories of Heretics The halakhah regarding heresy identifies several categories of trans- gressors and lays down different degrees of qualification as to the duty of exhibiting love or even toleration toward them, in accordance with the severity of their waywardness. The more noteworthy categories, for our purposes, include the mumar le-te'avon (transgressor motivated by the wish to gratify his desires), the mumar le-hakh'is (transgressor motivated by the wish to annoy the community), the 'epiqoros (heretic), the mehalel shabbat be-farhesiyah (desecrator of the Sabbath in public), and the poresh min ha-tzibbur (transgressor who departs from the community). It is often regarded not only as permissible, but even as a mitzvah (positive injunction), to hate most of these types of sinners. According to at least one interpretation, hatred of the mumar le-te'avon refers simply to reservations about his behavior and does not obviate the injunction of loving the person himself,24 but the more prevalent understanding holds that the mitzvah of love does not apply even to this less severe class of sinner. Thus, one is not only not obliged to love the mumar le-te'avon, but is even permitted to exclude him from the usual forms of welfare preserved for one's fellow-Jews, i.e., charity, return of lost articles and redemption from captivity, refraining from taking interest on loans to him, and providing him with tokhehah (chastisement). The last measure of restraint serves as an indication, not of the consideration invoked by toleration, but of the lack of regard invoked by indifference. As for the person who continues to transgress even after tokhehah, it is forbidden to mourn him or to participate in his burial. And as for the 'epiqoros and the mumar le-hakh'is, one is obligated not only to hate such sinners and 23. 23. TB Pesahim 113b; Shulhan 'Arukh, Hoshen Mishpat 272:11. 24. Tanya', pt. 1, chap. 32. For discussion of further references which mitigate the level of hatred one is obligated to harbor for the transgressor, see Yehudah 'Amital, "Regarding the Status of the Secular Jew in Our Days" (Hebrew), 'Alon Shvut le-Bogrei Yeshivat Har Etzyon, no. 6 (Elul 1988), pp. 11-12; Mordecai Gafni, "The Halakhic Approach Toward Secularists" (Hebrew), Mahanayinz, pp. 189-190, May, 1993.</page><page sequence="13">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 73 to deprive them of the usual forms of welfare, but also to actively cause them harm and even death. If one does not have the opportunity to actively cause their death, one is permitted to do so passively.2 All this rings very harshly to modem ears. Even in halakhic terms, the obligation to kill sinners appears especially problematic when contrasted with the general injunction against murder, whether of Jew or non-Jew. The severity of the law may be mitigated by the observation that wide gaps between theory and practical implementation are not unprecedented in halakhic literature. A case in point is the death penalty prescribed for certain transgressions that are really quite common, such as violations of Sabbath laws or sexual sins. When it comes to the application of these penalties, the Mishnah records a debate between tanna'im as to whether a Sanhedrin that pronounces such a penalty once a week, once in seventy years, or even once ever, is to be regarded as murderous. A question of this kind would seem to indicate that the intent of the penalty prescribed is not practical but didactic: to establish at least in theory the utter severity of certain transgressions, as if to say that such a sinner has in principle forfeited his true claim to God's gift of life. One might conclude that the same applies to the harsh attitude toward heretics prescribed in Jewish law. Even if there are practical difficulties preventing the actual application of the halakhic penalties, these prescriptions come to drive home to us that infidelity is a great spiritual travesty, and that the very presence of the heretic within a society of God-fearers poses a threat to the community's foundations.26 Transition to a Secular Age Even if the tendency to regard the more severe halakhic strictures against Jewish infidels as having an intent more pedagogic than practical is taken into account, the dramatic rise of secularism in the last 200 years has made it increasingly difficult for observant Jews to bear with the halakhah's generally intolerant attitude.

Two Ways of Relating to Secularism In broad general terms, two reactions to this difficulty developed within the halakhic community: entrenchment in the traditional position of intolerance, and erosion of the intolerance to a lesser or greater degree. The group adopting the first approach was aided by the general mistrust of modem espousals of toleration among absolutist religions. The historical links between an ideology of toleration and religious skepticism were too obvious to be ignored. No one could deny that the most severe threat to all the great monotheistic religions was posed by the critical attitude of modern freethinkers toward any system of thought that made pretentious claims to exclusive possession of the keys to truth and personal salvation. Since the very same critique is what lay behind the new embracing of toleration, it certainly could not be condoned. Recognizing that it was hard to avoid the pitfall of indifference when tolerating difference, some observant Jews came to the practical conclusion of favoring the formation of independent, separatist religious communities. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, attempts were already being made to distance the Maskilim (supporters of "enlightenment" and secular education) and the advocates of religious reform from the rest of the com- munity; these efforts were supported not only by the Hatam Sofer (R. Moses Sofer, 1762-1839), an avowed separatist, but even by the Maharatz Hayot (R. Zvi Hirsch Hayes, 1805-1855), a rabbinic leader generally regarded as having some degree of openness toward the outside world.27 Separatism was also the policy adopted by the Neo-Orthodox community of Frankfurt-am-Main at the instigation of R. Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888). A smaller and more selective society that still corresponded to the traditional conception of community would be able to bypass the need for toleration and remain true to the old norms and definitions. 27. This separatism was expressed in prescribing the avoidance of social contact with such dissident Jews, not mourning or eulogizing them, banning them as kosher witnesses, and forbidding intermarriage with them. See the collected writings of Maharatz Hayot, vol. 2, Iggeret Kannaut, p. 908 and on.</page><page sequence="15">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 75 Traditionalists adopting the second approach resisted cutting ties with what quickly became the majority of secular and nonobserving Jews in the emancipated communities of Western Europe. In the growing Yishuv in the land of Israel during the early years of the twentieth century, it became increasingly difficult to ignore the Jewish relevance of the larger surrounding community and relate to its members with total animosity and reserve. Such difficulties forced the Orthodox into a growing tension between a realistic recognition of the new secular reality and the codified religious categories of the past. Sometimes this tension was excused by a simple acknowledgment that the halakhically faithful had no choice; i.e., being in the minority, they simply lacked the political power to enforce strictures based on the old standards, and therefore had to make grudging peace with a workable coexistence which would at least protect their own right to live in accordance with traditional ideas and ideals. In accordance with the definitions established above, this of course would hardly qualify as a genuine position of toleration. Erosion Strategies A more subtle or covert version of this tension gradually manifested itself in an increasingly ingenious exploitation of whatever halakhic loopholes could be found in support of a more positively tolerant attitude at least toward freethinkers. Three facts were taken into consideration. The first was the secularist's own understanding of his behavior (i.e., he did not view his transgressions as sinful at all and therefore could not be regarded as a mumar le-hakh'is).28 Second was the fact that the secularist's transgressions had now come to be so widespread and commonplace that he could not even be 28. R. Ya'aqov Ettlinger (1798-1891), in Responsa Binyan Zion ha-Hadashot 10, sec. 23, rules that since many Sabbath transgressors even make Kiddush on Shabbat and pray, they cannot be regarded as deliberate Sabbath transgressors. Therefore one can be lenient regarding use of their wine, even though more stringent behavior is to be preferred. Precedent for taking into account the sinner's own view of his behavior can be found in the stance of the Radvaz (Rabbi David ben Zimrah, 1479-1573) at the time of the Spanish expulsion, in a responsum regarding a certain maggid who propounded views in the synagogue that confounded simple faith. The Radvaz ruled that the maggid was absolved of guilt, since he had not arrived at his heresy willfully, but only through faulty reasoning. See Yesh'ayahu Leibowitz's treatment of this responsum in "Two Conceptions of Toleration in Judaism" (Hebrew), in Emunah, Historiah ve-'Arahim (Jerusalem: Aqademon, 1982), p. 18. A similar line of reasoning can be found in a responsum of R. Aqiva Eiger, the rabbi of Posen at the end of the eighteenth century, who was asked whether someone who shaved with a razor could be regarded as a kosher witness. The answer: since this practice has become so widespread-for all our many sins-among so many</page><page sequence="16">76 TAMAR ROSS regarded as a poresh min ha-tzibbur.29 And third, the spirit of the new age was so seductive that the secularist could well be defined as a tinoq shenishbah (a Jewish child brought up in captivity by non-Jews) who is merely continuing in his parents' footsteps and does not know any better3" (and therefore does not even qualify as mumar le-te'avon). All these considerations served to justify a more charitable view of religious transgressors, based at the very least on paternalistic preconceptions. Another expedient supporting toleration consisted of the delegitimization of the mitzvah of tokhehah in the present day and age, in view of the ineffectual or even counterproductive effect it would have on contemporary secularists.3 But even here, the professed motivation for rejecting coercion or public sanction remained entirely tactical and pragmatic, and applied to the holders of the opinions, but not to the opinions themselves. The idea of applying new halakhic categories or theological assessments regarding the Jews, many do not regard it as forbidden. Here too there is a recognition that if many Jews do not observe a certain mitzvah, this affects its religious-halakhic status, or at least promotes a more lenient evaluation of its transgression; i.e., an admission that a religious-social change stemming from the fact that many Jews are not keeping a certain mitzvah has the power to evoke a new attitude regarding those Jews which does not regard them as religious transgressors. But this responsum still relates to people who are in principle observant Jews, and have merely lapsed in regard to the observance of a particular mitzvah. Both responsa assume that Jewish society at large should be governed by halakhah in principle, and that even a massive number of transgressors must still be regarded as exceptions to the halakhic rule which governs society as a whole. 29. R. David Zvi Hoffman (in Responsa Melanmed Leho'il 1, 29) establishes that the transgressors cannot even qualify as public Sabbath desecrators. The definition of farhesiya ("public") has changed, since it is now the majority that do not observe Shabbat. On the basis of this observation, he permits including them in a minyan, even though it is preferable to pray in another congregation if this can be done with creating offense. 30. A ruling by Maimonides that although it is a mitzvah to kill epiqorsim and nmumarin? who deny the divinity of the Torah, the children of such dissenters are to be regarded as tinoqot shenishbu who had no choice, serves as the basis for posqinm in recent generations to regard current secularists leniently. The lack of choice stems from a recognition of the possibility of intellectual seduction. E.g., see R. Meir Simha Ha-cohen of Dvinsk (1843-1928) in Meshekh Hokhma, Shemot 3, 19, or R. Tzadoq Ha-cohen in Tzidqat ha-Tzaddiq, sec. 43. An even more ingenious and radical rationale for relating to modem heretics be-'avotot ahavah ("lovingly") rather than with tokhehah ("chastisement"), and not applying the law of kofrinm to them, is suggested by the Hazon 'Ish (Yoreh De'ah, Hilkhot Shehitah 2, end of n. 16): i.e., the fact that Divine Providence is not evident in our day. 31. Hazon 'Ish's commentary on Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot De'ot 6:3.</page><page sequence="17">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 77 legitimacy of dissident opinions per se or their expression, in conformance with the ideological toleration of modern secular liberalism, was nowhere entertained. 3. Rabbi Kook's "Liberalism" New Strategies From various passages in R. Kook's writings, it is obvious that he disagreed vehemently with the separatist response to the phenomenon of secularism in Jewish society.32 Other passages indicate his affinity to the second approach. He most definitely was interested in exploiting whatever halakhic avenues already existed to support a positive attitude of optimism and love toward present-day sinners, out of a conviction that such an approach, combined with better public relations for the religious view, would be vastly more effective than intolerance in returning the wayward to the fold.33 Much of the charm of R. Kook's position emerges in the personal relationship he developed with the secularists, insisting on attributing religiously valid motives to their behavior even when it blatantly contravened halakhic norms. (Some, of course, were quick to express resentment at his presumptuous appropriation of their views.34 But, as has been pointed out elsewhere,35 the rhetoric of paternalism sometimes masks a stronger version of toleration that is not free to express itself more openly because of halakhic or similar compunctions.) Regarding the halakhic definition of present-day secularists, R. Kook exploited all the usual tactics mentioned above in order to arrive at a more charitable view of their status vis-a-vis the law. He also added a few new but similar strategies of his own. One of them was a romantic belief (obviously grounded on kabbalistic sources pertaining to the unique nature of the Jewish soul) which amplified upon the basic halakhic contention that the Jew's hidden will is always to observe mitzvot. 32. 'Orot (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, ), pp. 73-74. [au. year of pub.?] 33. Igrot R'ayah I (Jerusalem, 1962), pp. 58, 160-161. 34.

See Yosef Ahitov, "The Attitude Towards Secularists" (Hebrew), in Be-Hevlei Massoret u-Temura (Rehovot, 1990), pp. 35-50.</page><page sequence="18">78 TAMAR ROSS According to this view, the Jew, by definition, is constitutionally incapable of being a kofer (heretic), for kfira (heresy) entails an absolute conviction of God's nonexistence, whereas the Jew, if he is honest with himself, can claim at most to be an agnostic doubter. The rare Jewish "heretic," therefore, who claims that he is absolutely certain of his position, must be regarded as a rasha because of his hypocrisy and deceit, but not-presumably-because of his heresy.36 As for the more run-of-the-mill secularists, who are simply indifferent to religion, sometimes they arrive at their position out of moral weakness, although frequently this is not the case, as evidenced by the impressive idealism regarding social issues that some of them display, often at great personal cost, and even to the point of willingness to give up their very lives for the sake of the nation. For this reason, they may be likened to the talmudic example of the bird that protects itself from the hunter by perching on a statue of the king.37 Despite their heresy they cannot be condemned, due to their attachment to the Jewish nation. The nationalist or cosmopolitan aspirations of the Jewish secularists also preclude the possibility of defining them as cutting themselves off from the community at large (porshim mini ha-tzibbur) or as willful transgressors (mumarim le-te'avon).38 More often than not, the secularist position is an expression of the intellectual confusion that stems from the current cultural climate.39 R. Kook, like others before him, viewed the secular climate as so powerful and persuasive that it was to be likened to the more physical variety of seduction, which, according to at least one discussion in the Talmud, excuses the sexual transgressor to the extent that he is not regarded as unfit to bear witness in court.40 As for the mitzvah of tokhehah, R. Kook ruled that this obligation applies only to those who know how. For this reason, it really is only a hypothetical 36. Igrot R'ayah I, pp. 20-21. Further development of this idea appears in R. Kook's letter to the Ridbaz (Igrot R'ayah II, pp. 184-198). In this letter R. Kook also employs another metaphysical concept to justify his refusal to distance himself from the secular Zionists, i.e., the midrashic understanding of the 'erev rav ("mixed multitude") as those who were destined to produce superior offspring in the generations that follow. The use of this notion relates to a kabbalistic dispute about whether the final redemption will be the result of a separation of the holy and the profane, or the sanctification of the profane and its elevation. 37.

Therefore it was better to leave sinners to continue in unwitting transgression, and relate to them only with love.42 The halakhic contortions that R. Kook felt forced to adopt in order to support a liberal attitude toward the Jewish secularists of his day are evidenced most poignantly in his eulogy for the ten shomrim (members of a prestate security organization) who fell while defending an outpost in the Galilee.43 In this eulogy he expressed his pain over the fact that the instinctive impulse to mourn and glorify the memory of these young national heroes of pure motivation was necessarily tempered by the usual constraints that halakhah places on mourning and participating in the burial of repeated transgressors. After exploring some of the loopholes mentioned above and finding them wanting, he describes with bitter irony the "tragic bliss" of coming up with the final rock-bottom dregs of a solution to his dilemma. R. Kook is enabled to indulge his natural and spontaneous sorrow on this occasion by the fact that the Rema' quotes an opinion (of the 'Asheri) that deems any Jew killed by non-Jews to be exempt from the normal restriction against eulogizing religious wrongdoers.44 From all that has been said until now, it is obvious that R. Kook was stretching the halakhic possibilities of toleration for heretics to the maximum. The question that remains to be addressed, however, is whether his protestations of love for the secular halutzimn of his day stemmed merely from the considerations of his halakhic predecessors. Was his attitude simply a particularly graceful form of resignation to the fact that the religious were left with no choice under the circumstances? Was it meant to serve only as a temporary stopgap, undeserving of the title of toleration at all, or at most toleration of the prudential variety? Or did his halakhic rulings indicate a more profound deviation from traditional theological categories, and an affinity to 41. Ibid., p. 305. 42. For an expression of this view, see the letter R. Kook wrote to his parents in Igrot R'ayah I, pp. 352-353, regarding the policy of those who opposed his approach to the secularists. (In this letter he displays great nobility and personal tolerance regarding his adversaries on this issue.) 43. "'Al Bamoteinu Halalim," pp. 89-93. 44. Yoreh De'ah 340:5.</page><page sequence="20">80 TAMAR ROSS more modem and secular ideological considerations of the philosophical or even the altruistic variety? Satisfaction at Inability to Censure A question similar to this one was actually put to R. Kook by his beloved disciple, Dr. Moshe Zeidel, in an extremely interesting exchange of letters regarding the issue of toleration. The initial stimulus to this discussion was R. Kook's negative reaction to some comments made by Eliezer Ben-Yehudah, the editor of the periodical Ha-hashkafa, in the wake of the Uganda-Palestine debate.45 In response to those Zionists who based their opposition to the proposal to create a Jewish homeland in Uganda on the traditional connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel, Ben-Yehudah asserted that the very essence of Zionism was a rebellion against Jewish tradition and all it stood for, and therefore that the Uganda proposal was worthy of consideration. R. Kook viewed Ben-Yehudah's disparaging remarks about the relation- ship of the modern Zionist movement to the Jewish past and its tradition as a peculiarly perverse form of self-hatred. However, he added, "With all my love for learning and teaching the principles of our belief, I am far from demanding the imposition of these opinions on anyone else, as [such imposition] is not heeded in our day." It was this addendum that prompted Zeidel's query:46 was R. Kook's refraining from censure in this case a position taken out necessity (i.e., lack of choice, and therefore, in view of our earlier remarks, not really toleration at all), or because such restraint (or toleration) was prescribed by the law of the Torah, i.e., bears some intrinsic religious justification? Unmentioned, of course, was a third but hidden possibility, i.e., that R. Kook was prompted by totally secular considerations and values to "discover" such a norm within halakhah. Zeidel assumed, and we may assume with him, that a poseq of the stature of R. Kook would not deliberately allow personal views or ideological considerations that reflected the current cultural milieu to figure in his halakhic reasoning. But it could be argued that the question of toleration, by its very nature, cannot be divorced from such considerations. Moreover, the discomfiture of R. Kook and his generation regarding this question may have been so great that he was unconsciously forced in this instance to allow the two domains to intermingle. 45. Igrot R'alyah I, p. 18. 46. Ibid., p. 19.</page><page sequence="21">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 81 R. Kook responded to Zeidel's query in one of his most seminal discussions of the issue of toleration.47 On the one hand, he writes, if conditions in our day allowed for it, we would definitely be obliged by halakhah to publicly condemn wrongdoers; even now, when such sanctioning is not feasible, there is no room for unlimited toleration. But after defining the restrictions on toleration that still apply, and explaining why the antiliberal stance is impracticable from a halakhic point of view, he adds a consideration that raises just the whiff of a suspicion that the policy of toleration he is promoting may not stem entirely from negative considerations (i.e., lack of choice and the necessity to comply with an undesirable situation). R. Kook's argument runs as follows: Although the natural instinct of the national spirit is to assert its authority whenever signs of spiritual disintegration become apparent, such authority can be effectively imposed only when the nation's powers are at the height of their perfection. Therefore, Divine Providence sees to it that, despite the natural impulse for public censure, objective obstacles to the implementation of sanctions appear in direct proportion to the weakness of the national power. Sometimes these obstacles take the form of external, practical impediments, such as the fear of foreign rulers. Sometimes they are internal and spiritual, such as the halakhic injunction to refrain from reprimanding when censure will not be heeded. So far R. Kook's statement seems quite innocuous, but this does not hold for his concluding comment; here he says that when a social situation arises in which the mitzvah of tokhehah is inapplicable, we should feel satisfaction at the situation, out of a recognition that it expresses the divine will. Intrinsic Value of Noncoerced Belief At this point we may feel prompted to ask whether the satisfaction that R. Kook encourages us to feel is merely gratification at the fact that God limits our ability to censure when the nation's powers are not in full force, and correspondingly unwilling to accept reactions of zealotry, or is it perhaps an intrinsic valuation of a faith that is not acquired by coercive means, and in a social system totally free of externally imposed constraints. A closer look at several other passages in R. Kook's writings lends some credence to the second possibility.48 In one passage he contends that 47. Ibid., pp. 19-21. 48. This is in contradiction to the view of some that R. Kook's tolerance never goes beyond the status of post-factum (bedi'avad). E.g., see Yosef Ahitov, "Reflections Regarding the Future</page><page sequence="22">82 TAMAR ROSS when mankind was in the more primitive stage of its development, there was a religious interest in restricting opportunities for free inquiry and in subjugating the will. But now that human civilization has developed and some portions of the will and mind naturally tend toward the good, liberalism and anarchy are necessary concomitants. Although R. Kook hastens to add that the danger from whatever unpurified barbaric elements remain in such a state is even greater than before, he also believes that the return of religion and tradition to their former repressive tactics under such circumstances would constitute a grave error.49 In another passage, he views the increased interest in democratic rule rather than externally imposed standards as comparable to the increased willingness to apply moral standards of behavior to animals as well as to humans; both are parallel manifestations of the heightened spiritual awareness that human civilization is destined to gradually attain.50 Open Dialogue Furthers Truth In addition to these oblique references to the superior value of a political climate which protects the right to autonomous decision, when the level of intellectual and moral maturity of a given society warrants it, there are innumerable expressions in R. Kook's writings of vehement resistance to the stultification of man's creative and inquiring spirit.5' One of the reasons given for this is certainly reminiscent of the philosophic variety of ideological motivation in Position 3: i.e., that the open dialectic of opposing ideas furthers the flourishing of truth. With uncharacteristic sarcasm, the usually gentle and benign R. Kook sharply criticizes the provincialism of those small-minded people who think that "whatever exists outside the cavity of their skull is nothing but one long chaos," and that all of life and the world is no greater than what can be found in their little sphere.52 His mockery here supports an impassioned plea for recognition of the pluralism in Jewish thought, which should work for of Relations with the Secularists" (Hebrew), in Be-Hevlei Massoret u-Tentura, ed.

Kook is prepared to assume in support of this freedom are quite astounding: the more vulgar an idea, the greater its provocativeness, and therefore the greater its capacity for serving as a catalyst that stimulates thought and bears a constructive influence.56 Even heresy has a place in the world of ideas, as a stimulus to intellectual ferment.5 It is obvious that R. Kook is supremely confident of the ability of religious belief to emerge intact from any intellectual struggle. What emerges so far, then, is that on the level of abstract opinion, R. Kook's toleration is as lacking in reserve as that of the most skeptical liberal who reduces all conflicts of opinion to matters of taste. But aside from the test of motivation on the level of opinion, we have also cited a second test and determinant of ideological toleration, relating to its practical applicability. At this level R. Kook appears to exhibit several inconsistencies or anomalies. Inconsistencies Alongside the passages which express extreme liberalism by theoretically recognizing value in all opinions, even when these appear to wildly conflict, other passages seem to gravely limit and encroach upon public expression of this expansiveness of spirit. Thus, for example, in the aforementioned parable of the bird escaping the hunter's arrow because it is perched on the icon of the king,"5 R. Kook asserts that toleration for secularists due to their national loyalty must distinguish between their persons and their beliefs. One may pray with the transgressors, but must not take their sinful opinions into consideration or appoint them as leaders, and instead must try to win them over to the religious position by means of persuasion and explanation. 53.

Igrot R'ayah, pp. 171-172.</page><page sequence="24">84 TAMAR ROSS Then again, in a passage in which R. Kook speaks out vehemently against the tendency to silence freedom of thought in the name of faith,59 he nevertheless contends in the following paragraph that a kernel of truth can be found even in intolerance. What is it? The caution not to rely overmuch on human wisdom, and this is the basis for respect of Heaven. So there seems to be room for some intolerance in a basically tolerant stance whenever it promotes religious belief in practice. Not only does R. Kook circumscribe the expression of opinions. Some- times his reservations extend even to the holders of these opinions, after the fashion of traditional halakhah in the presecular age.6? Thus, alongside passages that express great appreciation for secularists personally, other passages call for extreme intolerance toward the transgressors. Some of these were written before his confrontation in the flesh with secular halutzim in Palestine, after which he found it more difficult to dismiss the notion of tolerating their persons despite disapproving of their actions. But in the very same letter to Moshe Zeidel cited above (written after R. Kook was already well established in Palestine) in which he expressed his opposition to public censure in our times, he claims in the same breath, regarding Eliezer Ben-Yehudah, that he who threatens any element at the basis of national existence, not only in action but even in thought, is to be regarded as a national criminal, and not to be tolerated. Despite these equivocations, we should not too hastily distance R. Kook's version of toleration from the ideological variety. For these difficulties merely reflect the general problem of the limits of toleration, which even the most enthusiastic advocate of pluralism must confront. 4. The Limits of Toleration There Must Be a Limit The truth is that however much the ideological tolerator would like to see unlimited freedom of expression, this ideal presents practical difficulties. 59. 'Orot ha-Emunah, pp. 67-68. 60. E.g., see Ginzei R'ayah 6 (Jerusalem, 1990), p. 151, where love of the rasha' is perceived as problematic because it could lead to a blurring of the distinction between the bearer of the wickedness and the wickedness itself.</page><page sequence="25">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 85 Just as the absolutist (Position 2) may be willing to suffer opinions other than his own at least in terms of their practical implications, the skeptical pluralist (Position 3) may be moved to recognize that interference with freedom of expression sometimes has a role. In order to maintain an atmosphere of toleration, he may not only have to disqualify positions that are intolerant, but sometimes will even be forced, out of purely practical considerations, to impose restraints upon various demands that if uncurbed, would be totally incompatible. Even when we do not seek interaction or cooperation, the very fact that several conflicting ideals may require the same social context in order to be realized, inevitably forces us into a situation where there is a reciprocal acknowledgment of rights and duties. For this reason issues of social and legal sanction, institutional arrangements, punishment and control, cannot be avoided; even the most liberal conception of government is invariably tempered by the fact that however legitimate the claim to a multiplicity of truths or values, something approaching consistency is necessarily called for in their practical application. So it is not the question of limits per se that distinguishes between one position of toleration and another, but exactly where and how the limits are drawn. In some of the passages cited above, we see R. Kook explicitly expressing a keen sensitivity to the social repercussions of opinions, and an awareness for this reason of the importance of distinguishing between an open, accepting attitude to purely theoretical opinions and toleration of opinions which influence people and bear practical implications. Thus, one of the grounds offered for limiting freedom of thought is the recognition that for all practical purposes it is virtually impossible to totally divorce thought from action, as actions tend to stem from ideas.61 For this reason, refraining from public expression even of ideas that are true in and of themselves is justified when such freedom of expression might exert a pernicious moral influence.62 Elsewhere, this qualification is expressed in even more sweeping terms. Even when he admits that freedom of thought has value when the interest is theoretical, R. Kook adds that since the masses are generally influenced by every passing whim, there is virtually no meaning in granting a liberty that is incapable of being realized in practice. The necessity for guaranteeing freedom of thought via the adoption of a positive initial bias serves as one 61. Igrot R'ayah I, 19-20. 62. 'Orot ha-Qodesh III, 282.</page><page sequence="26">86 TAMAR ROSS of R. Kook's rationales for the justice of submitting to the Torah's restrictive prescriptions. In general, then, neutrality of thought is a fallacy.63 Continuing in this vein, another passage asserts that the superior class of tzaddiqim are characterized by the ability to relate abstractly and benignly to deviant beliefs, presumably because they are capable of taking the long view, and of recognizing how these aberrations are merely temporary in their partiality, but destined to contribute to the eventual formulation of a greater and more inclusive formula of truth. But this favorable attitude to deviance is by no means allowed concrete expression in practice.64 Where Do We Draw the Line? In a religious system which emphasizes the importance of action far more than dogma, R. Kook was clearly not the first halakhist to have made the distinction between abstract opinions and those which have practical implications.65 A crucial question, however, both for the halakhist and for any propagator of toleration, is: What is the criterion for drawing the line between opinions that are harmless in their practical or societal impact, or at any rate can still be endured, and those that cannot be suffered because their consequences in the real world are pernicious? Maimonides would certainly have drawn the line at heresy, which he regarded as a practical transgression not to be suffered. As we have already noted, R. Kook seems to be equivocal on this point, or at any rate does not provide us with any clear indication as to when heresy is to be suffered and when not. In a letter to the Ridbaz (R. Jacob David ben Zeev Willowski, 1845-1918),66 who objected to his positive attitude to the Zionist secularists, R. Kook introduces the twin concepts of segulah (uniqueness) and behirah (chosenness) as two separate factors relating to the unique holiness of the Jewish people. Segulah is an intrinsic quality embedded in the nature of the Jewish soul by God's will, and comprises its 63. 'Arpelei Tohai; p. 18. 64. Ibid., p. 27. 65.

Behirah is dependent upon the Jew's good deeds and talmud torah, and is the religious aspect of the Jewish soul. R. Kook argues that the relationship between these two forces is not fixed and static, but undergoes changes at various periods of history. In the time of "the footsteps of the Messiah"-the dawn of the messianic age-the segulah aspect becomes dominant. Accordingly, R. Kook claims, he does not apply his attitude of toleration to all secularists indiscriminately, but only to those in whose internal nature he discerns a great measure of segulah. As for those who have completely lost their internal segulah, he reasserts the obligation to hate them. But then he cryptically adds that "there are many ways to ascertain whether it is so" (i.e., whether their segulah force is intact), and these are learned through study of Kabbalah.67 So it would seem that in his own mind, at any rate, he was following a consistent principle in drawing the line of toleration, but we have as yet to spell it out. Epistemological Bases for Drawing the Line We have already established that the different varieties of toleration are grounded upon different epistemological underpinnings. What I would like to suggest now is that the different views regarding the limiting of toleration are loosely allied, in like manner, to the same epistemological positions. The pure relativist who believes there is no absolute truth, and even the epistemological skeptic who doubts whether we can ever be certain of reaching it (i.e., Position 4 and some versions of Position 3), conclude that since there is no rational way to solve arguments, we must simply agree to differ, and perhaps even take positive delight in the colorfulness of our differences. Not only the bearers of various opinions, but even the opinions themselves, must be accorded equal weight and respect. Freedom of expression becomes the chief value if we wish to live together in peace, and the institutional structure of society must be so arranged as to provide it to the maximum extent possible. Only intolerant views and absolutist opinions that interfere with the freedom of others are to be excluded. A slightly more stringent approach follows from the first variant of Position 3, which is often termed "critical cognitivism." According to this view, "while truth as a metaphysical abstraction or unqualified and ultimate category may be a disputable concept, the fact is that opinions may be closer 67. Ibid., p. 188.</page><page sequence="28">88 TAMAR ROSS to or further from the truth, as well as ethically better or worse, and logically more or less soundly based."68 The protagonists of this view will never silence falsehood, reasoning that if we are not prepared to tolerate its expression, then we are assuming our own infallibility. But they also assert their own right to denounce whatever is falsehood in their eyes, and to hope for the creation of an ever-increasing area of common agreement. This view will also encourage pluralism of opinions, freedom of expression, and the exchange of ideas, not because variety is an ideal in and of itself, but because it is a means to further the process whereby more falsehoods will become manifest. Despite these differences, both pure relativists (or epistemological skep- tics) and critical cognitivists will combat any "melting pot" attempt on the part of utopianists to "improve" society in terms of a single ideal. As opposed to the absolutist, they will tend to be the "enemy of those whose single iitense vision of the ends of life drives them to try to make the requirements of the ideal coextensive with those of a common social morality."69 Their view of society itself is totally instrumentalist. In the end, its value is subservient to the interests of the individuals who compose it. Such value exists only to the extent that it serves to provide an operative framework for the pursuit of truth or the expression of more personal ideals which demand a broader and more complex context for their fulfillment. 5. The Dialectic Nature of Truth R. Kook's Metaphysical View As with other varieties of toleration, the key to R. Kook's decisions in regard to practical policy lies in a precise definition of his motivation and the specific nature of its epistemological underpinnings. Just as pure relativism tends to lead the altruistically tolerant to regard pluralism and freedom of choice as the ultimate value to be protected, and critical cognitivism leads the philosophically tolerant to see this value in guarding freedom of expression, so the pluralist scheme that R. Kook subscribes to tends him to a specific formula of toleration with its own criteria for setting limitations upon freedom on the level of embodied beliefs and opinions. 68. Strawson, "Limits of Toleration," p. 53. 69. Strawson, "Social Morality and Individual Ideal," p. 44.</page><page sequence="29">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 89 As has already been demonstrated by 'Ish-Shalom, the truth is that, despite the affinity of R. Kook's thought to the ideological toleration of modem secular liberalism, the toleration that he expresses really rests on entirely different premises: a uniquely religious worldview, predicated on the mystical notion of an infinite God who is absolute existence.70 From God's point of view, this infinite and absolute reality is a monolithic undefined unity, with no distinction between disparate entities. Plurality and diversity are merely the function of man's limited perceptions. Nevertheless, the fact that his perceptions are partial manifestations of the One is what gives them their validity. The task of finite minds is to try to reconstruct a perfect facsimile of the ultimate unity that is God's, in the form of a composite unity that continually incorporates within itself all newly discovered diversity. From the limited standpoint of created minds, this facsimile appears even greater than the original infinite unity which is God's, because it has the additional power of growth. R. Kook's view here is very similar to that of many mystics, and is strikingly close to the neo-Hegelian mysticism of the English philosopher F. H. Bradley (1864-1924), an older contemporary (R. Kook was born in 1865 and died in 1935), whose works he probably did not know. Bradley, like Kook, was a metaphysical monist, believing, in line with the Parmenidean, Neoplatonic tradition, that only the One was real, leaving no room for the existence of separate entities, not even individual selves.7' Bradley regarded self-conscious individual selves and the disparate objects of the world as we know it as ultimately mere appearance, produced by the emergence of Thought to disrupt the unity of Immediate Experience. And he also supposed that the task of finite minds or selves, in the process of Thought, was to attempt to recreate by disjunctive reasoning a coherent picture of reality which would come as close as possible to the original unity. In this attempt, Thought would act, through its finite centers in minds, to replicate the lost unity by taking up more and more aspects of the real into the net of discursive reasoning until finally nothing would be left out, and the original unity would be regained, in enhanced form, by the copy and original uniting in what Bradley called the "Absolute Experience." 70. 'Ish-Shalom, "'Tolerance and Its Theoretical Basis," p. 153. 71. See particularly his Appearance and Realit,, 2nd ed. (London, 1897) and Essays on Truth and Reality (Oxford, 1914).</page><page sequence="30">90 TAMAR ROSS This metaphysical scheme may be regarded as a sort of parallel to the Lurianic cosmic process of the tzimtzum and the "breaking of the vessels," which created the unredeemed world as we know it, and its tiqqun, the mending of the lost unity. R. Kook's interpretation of this process as an enhancement, in which the static monistic unity is rejoined by a dynamic element, is the counterpart of Bradley's notion of the dialectic process in which Immediate Experience is disrupted by Thought in order to be enhanced when the synthesis between Thought and Experience is regained in the Absolute Experience. As opposed to the critical cognitivists, who understand the process of coming closer to the truth as the gradual elimination of error, we shall see that R. Kook, like Bradley, sees this process as achieved by taking up the truth in each partial view. Pure Relativism There is a point of similarity between R. Kook's epistemological falli- bilism (i.e., the idea that truth, from man's point of view, is never absolute) and the intellectual and moral skepticism that fosters pluralistic notions of modem secular relativism. The impression of similarity is especially strengthened by R. Kook's ability not only to tolerate the heretic's right to doubt, but even to attribute elements of truth or value to the heretical posture itself.72 Nevertheless, it would be inaccurate to equate this position with the pure relativist's negation of the very existence of absolute truth, or with the epistemological skeptic's despair of ever achieving it-as 'Ish Shalom may (mistakenly, I believe) be taken to mean when he asserts that R. Kook adopts a relativistic stance toward all metaphysical systems and attributes to them only the status of hypotheses.73 The fact that this equation follows immediately upon the heels of 'Ish-Shalom's previous and correct observation of the unique metaphysical basis for R. Kook's expressions of toleration serves to highlight the inappropriateness of alleging that he was an indiscriminate or unqualified relativist. Failure to attend to some of the finer subtleties underlying R. Kook's position, and demarcate it clearly from that of the true relativist, could easily stem from too loose a use of the term 72. 'Orot ha-Emunah, pp. 23-24 (a parallel passage appears in 'Arpelei Tohar, p. 45). 73. Ibid., pp. 153-154.</page><page sequence="31">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 91 "relativism," which often serves as an umbrella for two or three quite separate claims.74 At first blush, the epistemological approach assumed by R. Kook's position may appear closer to the more muted version of relativism supported by the "getting closer to the truth" approach of Position 3. For on the one hand, R. Kook states that reality is so all-encompassing and rich that it can never be contained in any one formulation of truth.7" This sounds like the epistemological skepticism of the second variant of Position 3, or the even purer relativism of Position 4. But on the other hand, he also states that the clash between rival ideas furthers the cause of truth.76 This statement is more moderate and seems to reflect a critical cognitivist position-that of the first variant of Position 3. R. Kook here advocates pluralism not because he does not believe in the existence of absolute truth, but on the contrary, out of his conviction that the very plurality of options will lead us closer to it. The clash between rival opinions spurs us on to refine our ideas and continually improve upon our formulations, thereby coming closer to the truth.77 However, as 'Ish-Shalom himself and others have pointed out,78 R. Kook asserts more than this. Any particular formulation, he maintains, necessarily contains something of the infinite reality that truth is trying to grasp.79 The tension between opposing truths is valuable not only because it challenges us to refine our own views against the foil of others or encourages us to discard them completely if they seem to be false. A successful confrontation, according to R. Kook, never entails the diminishing of rival viewpoints. On the contrary, to the extent that rival ideas each have their own element of truth, the confrontation between them spurs us to seek an overarching formula that contains the truth in all. When we see differences that appear absolute, we must search for a method of harmonizing them and achieving a new synthesis. The test of the synthesis is its capacity to absorb and vitalize differences, and connect them to a common source. Apparently conflicting pictures are 74. The danger is intensified by the fact that R. Kook himself (Igrot R'ayah I, p. 47) describes the Jewish understanding of all human perceptions as "subjective and relative," without adding any further distinctions. 75. 'Orot ha-Qodesh II, p. 403; ibid. III, p. 327. 76. "Ne'edar ba-Qodesh," Ma'amnarei R'ayah II, p. 400. 77. Igrot R'ayah I, p. 164. 78.

In this image, every truth is given its proper due, and conflict is avoided by careful arrangement and proper subordination of part to part. What emerges is a harmonious complexity, gloriously rich in its infinity. For this reason the value of toleration rests, not in its power to obliterate differences and debates, but in its ability to sustain them in order to highlight a new reality. Just as two negatives, in the physical sciences, do not cancel each other out but rather create a new positive, so too in the world of the spirit.80 While every formulation has an element that is essential and true, it also has an element that is false. Conflicts and contradictions between formulations stem, not from what each asserts, but from what they deny.81 It is the pretentious claim to exclusiveness, and the inability to recognize the legitimate aspects of rival points of view, that creates the false impression of incompatibility. Alternatively, the recognition of complementariness, and the willingness to be augmented by the other, further the cause of truth. All this leads to a definite hierarchy of value. The relative weight of each part depends on its place in the total context and the degree of its ability to be inclusive; the more comprehensive or inclusive the formulation, the more valid.82 Thus the final formulation is not merely the arithmetical sum of its various parts; this would contribute nothing to the elimination of the clash between them. The identity and significance of each element is necessarily transformed when supplemented by its rivals within the larger contextuality, while still maintaining the uniqueness of its own individuality. One conclusion that emerges from R. Kook's metaphysical conception of truth is that even when what is concerned is on the level of unembodied opinion, with no obvious practical application, the positive element in his toleration is not as robust as it first appears. On the one hand, it is fair to say that for all its paternalism, R. Kook's attitude of acceptance exceeds the simple blindness to difference which generally characterizes that position. The tolerated view is welcomed not merely because the misreading of its true nature is temporary and the entire conflict will eventually emerge as illusory 80. 'Eder ha-Yaqar, p. 14. 81. 'Orot ha-Qodesh III, p. 327; see also 'Orot ha-Qodesh II, p. 484. 82.

It is also welcomed for what it can genuinely do to revise and improve the more inclusive point of view. But, by the same token, the positive element in his toleration cannot be regarded as a willingness to coexist with any idea as it stands, but only for what it too might become when enveloped by a larger context. More specifically, his notorious appreciation for secularism does not rest on the terms in which secularism perceives itself (namely, as something respectable on its own merits), but on what it becomes when incorporated in a religious context which totally transforms its significance. Seen this way, secularism is a passing heresy whose values are eventually sucked up and become something new. 6. The Limits of Toleration The Limits to Toleration R. Kook's divergence from the policies of secular relativist toleration becomes even more clear in his criteria for setting practical limits to the enduring of opinions which have practical import. Admittedly, some of R. Kook's statements of the rationale for limiting toleration could be taken as faint echoes of those ascribed above to the pure relativist or epistemological skeptic of Position 3. For example, in the letter to Dr. Zeidel, he lists the two reasons for limiting freedom as the fact that no virtue is good in the extreme and the danger of nihilism.83 If the reason for R. Kook's objection to extremism in any virtue is that it prevents the expression of others, then both of the preceding considerations might still be conceived as not exceeding the self-imposed bounds of neutrality of the ideological tolerator committed to maximal pluralism. However, R. Kook continues his discussion of the necessity to limit toleration by offering several criteria for ranking conflicting views that are not merely procedural and formal, but involve an appeal to a substantive scale of values. And if we attempt to reconstruct the common thread underlying this ranking for the purpose of practical policy, it is easily seen that the limits to toleration that he imposes are a direct result of his harmonistic vision of truth, and the unique view of society stemming from it. According to this view, the ultimate value to be protected by intolerance is not freedom of choice, as in the second 83. Igrot R'ayah I, pp. 19-21.</page><page sequence="34">94 TAMAR ROSS variant of Position 3, or truth, as in the first variant of Position 3, but that of social cohesion. Along with the philosophic tolerator of Position 3's first variant, R. Kook would agree that a central function of community is to guarantee and foster the search for truth. But because R. Kook's vision of truth is of the harmonistic variety, social cohesion in his scheme is not merely an instrumental value, i.e., a tool which provides the necessary context for working out individual ideas and ideals. It is rather the concrete affirmation and projection of his harmonistic view of truth on the political plane. Therefore, although freedom is a positive value, society cannot exist without the imposition of certain limitations designed to guarantee each element of truth its rightful position in the total context. The objection to total anarchy is not merely pragmatic. To the extent that opinions and beliefs are not unembodied entities, the coexistence of various elements in one community signify for R. Kook proof of his ideal truth's existence.. Indeed, his ideal of truth can only be realized within a social collective context.84 R. Kook adopts the classical view in which society is seen as a unity of a number of "natural" institutions-family, socioeconomic class, tribe, nation, extending to humanity at large, and finally to all of creation.85 Each collective unit contributes, in its distinctive way, to the intellectual, moral, social, and spiritual development of the human being, who derives his status from his place in society.86 Society has a formal structure, divided into groups with different functions; and within each of these groups each member has a distinctive role which represents his or her contribution to the total whole. Thus, for R. Kook social cohesion is not an incidental means to individual self-expression. It is a value unto itself, to which the individual contributes and only thereby finds his own worth. In this version of pluralism, society itself has a sort of moral standing, the product of a sense of actively shared identity, which reflects the all-inclusive unity of God. 84. 'Ikvei ha-Tzon, pp. 147-148. 85. 'Orot, pp. 42-44, 'Orot ha-'Enmunah, p. 105. 86. E.g., see R. Kook's remarks on the status of the Jewish woman. The fact that Jewish society is composed of households and families, rather than individuals, as the basic unit guarantees the Jewish woman her unique position within her home, and spares her the need to resort to the indignities of political hustling (Igrot R'ayah III, pp. 50-51).</page><page sequence="35">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 95 Protecting Society's Interests How is this harmonistic view of truth and society translated into practice? What criteria for limiting toleration does it engender? As a harmonistic pluralist, R. Kook is inclined to define the limits of toleration in terms of the common morality which delineates each society at large, and to be intolerant of any element threatening this principle of cohesion. The logic of cohesion dictates the theoretical principle that the more comprehensive an idea, the more it demands zealousness (although the very quality of comprehensiveness'belies its zealous nature).87 A more explicit expression of R. Kook's social policy of comprehensive- ness appears in his communitarian extension of J. S. Mill's harm principle. Instead of the criterion of individual self-preservation overriding the concern for liberty, R. Kook asserts that any idea that poses a threat to the existence and moral fiber of the society that adopts it ought to be curtailed. If a society were to tolerate a potential threat to its distinctive quality, this would be no more than communal flabbiness and tantamount to collective suicide.88 Implicit in this view of toleration is the idea that society's entire moral climate must reflect some collective image of human solidarity that is the product of an actively shared identity. However, R. Kook adds, it is not easy to establish just what ingredient is necessary for the preservation of any particular society, since morality is relative, and different societies require different standards. In order to understand his specific prescription for the preservation of Jewish society, we must first establish his understanding of the nature of nationalism in general, and of Jewish nationalism in particular. Nationalism R. Kook's view of society and its relationship to the individual led him to adopt a view of nationalism that was especially popular in the nineteenth century. He begins with an assumption that prevailed in several forms in ancient and medieval times (and was most natural in ancient times, when "nation" referred to an ethnic group, rather than the modern situation, where it pertains more to a political unit): each nation represents a metaphysical entity or personality, a living organism, a moral and collective body, and is 87. 'Orot, pp. 130-131. 88. Igrot R'ayah I, pp. 19-20.</page><page sequence="36">96 TAMAR ROSS not merely a product of law and historical circumstance. While all national groupings are concerned to protect their physical welfare, what distinguishes the character of one nation from another is the unique set of virtues and talents which God has distributed to each particular national group.89 These virtues and talents bestow an aesthetic dimension upon the concern for the nation's physical welfare9 that defines and constitutes the national personality, is reflected in its laws, traditions, and customs, and forms its social climate. The continuing presence of this dimension in the national life serves as the basis for its organized activity and as the sign and guarantee of its unity. Jewish Nationalism What distinguishes R. Kook's theory of nationalism from the more general nineteenth-century conception is the view of Jewish nationalism that he grafts upon it. Central to this view is the notion that the distinct contribution of the Jewish people to the community of nations is not some unique cognitive ability, emotional inclination, or talent, but the urge to concentrate and reflect the various divine powers distributed and scattered among the other nations in a comprehensive unified form. The raison d'etre of the Jewish people is to gather all the special qualities that serve to define the respective national characters of the other nations and weld them together as varying expressions of a common moral urge.91 R. Kook equates this moral urge with religious faith, or the striving for perfection.92 The unique task of the Jewish people is to harmonize and readjust the mass of expressions of this cosmic urge, and form them into a cohesive unity, by establishing and enforcing mutual reciprocation, and providing a general spiritual context for a plurality of 89. 'Orot, p. 152, sec. 2. This theme was also stressed by Mazzini, in delineating the nature of modem nationalism. 90.

Kook's view of knesset yisrael as the concentrate of all humanity is rooted in the special status that this concept has in qabbalistic symbolism, where knesset yisrael is equated with malhut, the lowest sefira, which serves as a final receptacle for the bounty of all the higher sefirot that flow into it. This sefira is characterized by the fact that it has no special character of its own. Its lack of a distinguishing quality is just what allows it to best serve as a sponge for collecting all the others, for its own character poses no barrier. 92. 'Arpelei Tohan; pp. 3, 105-106; 'Orot ha-Teshuvah, chap. 5, sec. 2; 'Orot ha-Qodesh III, pp. 65-66; 'Orot, p. 138, sec. 3.</page><page sequence="37">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 97 diverse units.93 Reflecting the divine unity in this manner, the Jewish people serve as the special instrument of divine revelation. It is in the Jewish people's way of life and creativity that the process of revelation finds its fullest expression.94 Acknowledging that the religious element is not always experienced consciously as such by every member of the Jewish nation, R. Kook contends that latently it is always there and ready to be activated.95 He does not wish to imply that non-Jews are totally devoid of moral and religious values. The urge to reflect the divine pervades all men, and indeed all creation. But this yearning normally exhibits itself via the individual as such, who derives his divine essence directly from a cosmic urge best described as the universal soul, rather than being determined by the national unit. It is only among the Jewish people that the development and expression of this urge is translated into the very fabric or special content of national life,96 so that the individual Jew derives his religious striving from the national soul. Because the quality of Jewish nationalism has a specific religious and moral value, it is different in kind from all other forms of nationalism. Indeed, the application of the term "nation" to the Jews is justified only in the sense that all human collectives are described as such, but should really be understood as a mere figure of speech.97 In all other forms of nationalism, the individual derives his status from his place in society, but the national unity, in turn, is subservient to the interests of humanity at large. As a result, in some instances it is permissible for the individual to disregard the national interest when it works against the interests of the universal community of mankind.9" The purpose of any collective is to further moral flourishing, and if any expression of the national will is counterproductive to this end, the state has no right to that interference. But because the essence of Jewish nationalism is the striving for unity, the desire to hold together a complex hierarchy of groups, the Jewish people does not compete as a nation among other nations, 93.

Jewish nationalism does not stand in conflict with universalism, and is particularist only in the sense that universalism is particularist.99 A Judaism that is intolerant of universal urges has no legitimacy.'" Judaism is ideally incapable of chauvinism, for its essential nature is cosmopolitan.'10 Its purpose is to provide a model of harmonization on a national scale (the widest scale capable of recognizably bearing the joint experience necessary to found a common life) that will eventually be adopted by humanity at large and obviate the need for nationalism altogether. 102 The world is not yet ready to adopt this cosmopolitan model when it is represented by individuals, because in their present form, national groups tend to take over the world and overrun the harmony represented by individuals with their collective competitiveness. In R. Kook's view, the Torah serves as an ideal framework or starting point for Jewish nationalism, because it provides the most liberal bias possible, providing a model for the accommodation of all views in their rightful relationships and proportions. R. Kook would regard the thin patriotism engendered by the secular instrumentalist view of statehood as incapable of sustaining the unity of Jewish society for very long. In fact, he takes a dim view of nationalism in general (i.e., secular nationalism) when it is taken too 99. This paradox parallels the paradox commonly attributed to liberalism: the liberal must be intolerant of the anti-liberal in the name of liberalism. 100. 'Arpelei Tohar, pp. 56-57; 'Orot ha-Qodesh III, pp. 349-350; 'Ikvei ha-Tzon, p. 123. 101. According to R. Kook, the Jewish people's unique comprehensive quality of concen- trating all powers and meshing them into one coherent whole gives rise to concomitant other qualities, just as one is not surprised that the brain and heart of the individual organism exhibit manifestations of life that are not found in the rest of the body ('Orot, p. 138, sec. 2). Because they contain all tendencies, the Jewish people are more prone to inner conflict. For the same reason, they are more self-sufficient. (ibid., p. 169). Another difference is the creative power of the history and culture of the Jewish people. The national cultures of other nations merely rearrange what already exists in various forms and constellations; they describe and preserve. But Jewish creativity is ex nihilo, true innovation ('Orot ha-Qodesh III, pp. 67-69). This is similar to the view of R. Yehudah Halevi, who also held that Israel's uniqueness did consist in its comprising an organism separate from the rest of humanity, but rather in its serving as the heart of the general universal organism. There is no room for questions of equality within an organism, because all parts of the hierarchy work together for the common good. It is only when the various elements are viewed in partial, individual terms that there is room for talk of inequity. 102. 'Orot, p. 156, sec. 11.</page><page sequence="39">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 99 seriously, for it then becomes a divisive factor, rather than one that contributes to cohesion and synthesis. R. Kook's appeal to secularists to adopt religious practice is based on a shared concern for social cohesion. He assumes that for Jewish secular nationalists, social cohesion alone is an intrinsic value, and toleration of religious observance merely the efficient means for obtaining that end, once its past record convinces them that it is an essential means of ensuring the national existence.'"0 For the religious, however, the secularists' concern for social cohesion is in itself proof of their relevance to the religious ideal of pluralistic harmony, and sufficient grounds for suffering their pragmatism and lack of true conviction. Thus each camp assumes a hierarchy of values that overarches the values of the other without canceling them out, effectively transforming whatever dissonances it is confronted with into a value compatible with its own point of view.'1" The appeal for toleration on the part of the religious derives additional support from the faith that the beneficial influence of a Torah way of life will eventually win out and be internalized by the secularists. Nevertheless, what this strategy paradoxically achieves is that only the toleration of the religious is based on regard for pluralism (albeit of a limited, harmonistic sort) as an intrinsic value, whereas secularist toleration for religious practice is motivated by merely prudential considerations.1"' R. Kook does not take into account the possibility that secularism, on ideological grounds, might be committed to a more radical version of pluralism than his, as an intrinsic value. R. Kook's unique view of the Jewish nation's function serves to explain some of the apparent inconsistencies in his toleration policies on the practical level. Toleration of secularists has its place so long as secularism maintains some attachment to the body of the nation as a whole.'" Secularists like Eliezer Ben-Yehudah, who explicitly renounced his connection with the Jewish past, forfeit the right to toleration not only of their opinions, but even of their persons, because they introduce an element of divisiveness 103.

Kook most likely viewed Ben-Yehudah's willingness to entertain the Uganda option and divorce himself from the benign influence of living in the traditional Jewish homeland as a final confirmation of the futility of encompassing his views within the pluralistic totality of Jewish cohesion. Religious Coercion Can tolerance of this kind be called liberal? If we restrict ourselves to the level of unembodied opinion, R. Kook's dialectic concept of truth and unrestrained espousal of pluralism may afford some defense against the standard objection to absolutist religion brought by the pure relativist and the more moderate skeptic. His openness to rival notions of truth is obviously more congenial to them than the standard religious view. But it just as obviously cannot succeed in capturing the full impact of modern secular notions of toleration, once we consider R. Kook's reservations regarding embodied opinions which, in their concrete applications, threaten his ideal image of social solidarity. Here we must ask whether it is practically possible to view any society as a whole, and Jewish society in particular, as a single moral entity, given the pervasive pluralism of modern liberal societies. In the absence of a general recognition of society as a moral entity, any attempt to establish such a status would seem to stand in vulnerable tension with the ideal of modem secular liberalism. The modern secular liberal generally views society as the voluntary product of an arbitrary convergence of individual interests. In his eyes, society's value extends just so far as it serves and accords with the private interests of its individual members, which are determined by their previously established, autonomous choices. But whenever there is a definite ideal image of society based on human solidarity, and especially when this is connected to religious devotion, we have a much greater demand for a comprehensive common morality, and an insistence on the need to make the whole moral climate of an existing national state reflect this ideal. In view of the natural diversity of human ideals, one would expect the members of such a state to be subject to at least some coercion. And the modem liberal outlook finds such coercion objectionable. But even though R. Kook's criterion for limiting toleration (a well-defined picture of social cohesion) is more restrictive than that of the usual ideological tolerator (whose only bottom line is the undefined pursuit of truth or freedom of expression), it is precisely our third and final determinant of toleration</page><page sequence="41">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 101 (extent of self-restraint mandated, or degree of intervention condoned) that is perhaps the most crucial. Once we have established just how far R. Kook will go in tolerating the objectionable before intervening (threat to social cohesion), we must ask what form of intervention his opposition entails. Will gentle persuasion suffice, or will he strive for externally imposed coercion as well? At this point, our secular modern liberal may be mollified by another unexpected twist in R. Kook's toleration policy. This is illustrated in an interesting exchange of opinions which took place in the year 1920 between R. Kook and Rabbi Dr. Bernard Drakhman, one of the leaders of religious Zionism in the United States.10" In this exchange, R. Kook took issue with Drachman's call for a rapprochement between the secular Zionist leaders and the religious Yishuv in the form of legislation enforcing halakhah that would leave the individual free to retain his own beliefs in private. Although there is no doubt that R. Kook agreed with Drachman's arguments in favor of legislation of this kind (e.g., religion and nationalism are inseparable in Judaism, religion is the factor that preserves the unity of the Jewish people), he opposed Drachman's conclusion. The most significant feature of R. Kook's opposition was its rationale.The usual traditionalist justification for delegitimizing public enforcement of halakhah, as we have noted above, rests on the tactical consideration that since in our day and age society disapproves of coercion, one may assume that coercion will not produce retroactive gratitude. But R. Kook's argument was different; he held that legislating a requirement for religious observance was a policy of treating symptoms superficially that typified the Galut mentality. In the era of Redemption, superficial observance of the mitzvot does not suffice. We need a religious life that will attract secularists on its own merits, not out of a pragmatic modus vivendi. Choices made from inner conviction rather than in obedience to authority are qualitatively superior, because autonomous decisions truly indicate and deepen resolve.108 107. For a discussion of this exchange, see Rivka Shatz, "R. Kook's Stand Regarding the Question of Religious Legislation in 1920" (Hebrew), Kivvunim 33 (1986): 101-104. 108. If the son's behavior is any measure of the father's policy, it is worth noting that R. Zvi Yehudah objected to nonobservant visitors donning a head covering merely out of deference to him when such practice was unaccompanied by inner conviction. He was also a card-carrying member of the League Against Religious Coercion until he became convinced that his unlikely colleagues had no comparable objection to the coercion of secular practices. See Yaron, Philosophy of R. Kook, p. 337, n. 40.</page><page sequence="42">102 TAMAR ROSS In tendering this argument for noncoercion, R. Kook introduced an additional version of toleration, sometimes known as voluntarism, which stands between the prudentialist and ideological varieties.'09 On the one hand, this motivation need not entail any compromise with the certainty of one objective truth. On the other hand, it accepts pluralism not merely out of a realistic resignation to the brute facts of life, but because a variety of options is necessary for the exercise of true choice and the best means for verifying commitment. This justification for toleration is particularly suited to religious systems, or to any moral system that requires behavior based on decisions of conscience, or genuine acceptance. Admittedly, the history of halakhah indicates that there has never been a total consensus in Judaism regarding this issue." At most, deliberate intention was considered requisite to the fulfillment of certain specific mitzvot, without denying the value of routine or externally motivated observance in general. Perhaps it is no mere accident of history that one of the first Jewish versions of the voluntarist argument can be found in the writings of Moses Mendelssohn, who differentiated between social deeds, whose value lies in the act itself, and religious deeds, which require inner conviction in order to bear merit. The special emphasis of both Mendelssohn and R. Kook on the importance of voluntarism can be viewed as evidence of the same wish to explore the possibility of a new type of affinity between the political temper fostered by the ideal image of man in a religious framework, and the social ideals of the modem secular liberal. In terms of the third criterion we established for distinguishing between prudential and ideological toleration (restraint from intervention), R. Kook's conviction that we are on the brink of messianic times fortifies his tendency to a policy of nonintervention that extends beyond contingent pragmatic considerations and approaches the altruistic principle of total freedom of expression. His ability to see the modern appreciation of autonomy as the supreme value as an indication of the higher level of spirituality (worship out of love, or devequt) that he associates with the messianic age could be viewed as a form of rapprochement with modern liberalism. 109. For one of the earliest systematic presentations of this argument, see Locke's Epistola de Tolerantia, published in 1688. This most likely served as the subsequent basis for viewing autonomous decision as a necessary prerequisite of morality in Kantian ethics. 110. For sources, see Sagie, "Jewish Religion."</page><page sequence="43">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 103 However, in view of R. Kook's vehement outcries against all manner of public desecration of the Torah in the new Yishuv, it would be fair to assume that even here the societal principle is not redundant, and that-unlike Mendelssohn-R. Kook would not have been prepared to support a Jewish state which separated church and state as a matter of principle."' Although he would have agreed with the altruistic tolerator that one of the central functions of community is to guarantee and foster liberty, he would most likely still have asserted that to be free is not to be able to do whatever one chooses, but rather, the liberty to self-realization through the communal will, or common morality. In this sense, even a more restrictive view of society can have as its goal the development of individuals and the promotion of their interests, to the extent that true liberty is ultimately found only within the larger whole. Maimonides' defense of religious coercion was correct in his time,"2 because the professed will of the nation was to observe mitzvot, and this defined the individual's true will as well, even when he was temporarily overcome by a conflicting passion. One may assume that if the Sanhedrin had been reinstated by majority consent (a possibility that R. Kook actively sought to realize), R. Kook would have deemed all its coercive measures as once again legitimate, because this very reinstatement would have served as confirmation of the higher level of identity between the communal will and the private will of its individual members envisioned in the messianic age. Until such time, restraint from interference in the form of religious legislation is called for only as long as, and to the extent that, society in general opposes such measures. But this certainly does not eliminate the duty and right to persuasion by education and all other democratically approved measures. If society opposes demonstrations, public agitation, or any other form of persuasion, the individual must acquiesce because of his respect for society, but not because these methods are intrinsically invalid."3 111.

Kook's position on toleration is unusually complex. It defies classification by means of the usual stereotypical division between prudential (absolutist, religious) and ideological (relativist, secular) versions of tolera- tion. Its atypical nature stems from the fact that it rests on a unique amalgam of disparate factors, some tremendously liberating, and others pointing just as strongly toward intolerant constraint. R. Kook's undogmatic metaphysic of truth, and the fact that it mandates a constant struggle to refine particular truth-assertions, tends to an attitude toward abstract opinion which is so liberal that it hardly qualifies as toleration at all, because it is not in the least grudging. However, even on the level of unembodied truths, the harmonizing character of the pluralism that R. Kook favors serves as a restraining factor, for in the attempt to synthesize differences in the context of an overarching truth, their original significance can be totally distorted. This intolerant tendency is furthered the moment R. Kook allows himself to overstep the bounds of nonpaternalistic neutrality in the realm of practical policy and specifically define in advance the nature of the overarching truth to be achieved, as he does when defining the specific character of Jewish nationalism as a comprehensive religious urge. On the other hand, when R. Kook's messianic views are coupled with his definition of Jewish nationalism, he is moved to delay coercive policies until they are assumed voluntarily by the collective will of the nation, as befits the messianic age. But the fact that he makes no principled objection to coercive politics, and does not shy away from agitating for the domination of a collective will by democratic means, leads him back to a more restrictive toleration policy that considerably limits the parameters of pluralism. 7. Society and the Individual Communitarianism In some respects R. Kook's notion of toleration is strongly reminiscent of the current critique of modem secular liberalism that has come to be known as communitarianism.114 In the spirit of R. Kook, communitarians claim that 114. For a more extensive account of communitarianism and its critique of liberalism, see Charles Taylor, "Cross-Purposes: The Liberal-Communitarian Debate," in Liberalism and the</page><page sequence="45">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 105 liberalism can manage to totally disregard the notion of the general good only because it paints a distorted picture of man, ignoring what real people are like, denying their basic need for mutual relations and the fact that their individual natures are inevitably determined within the context of community and tradition. Society, say the communitarians, is not merely a voluntary association or a cooperative venture for mutual advantage, where each person participates only so far as it accords with his or her private interests, and where the association itself lasts only so long as it achieves a limited, agreed-upon aim. By providing the ultimate determining context within which individual choices are recognized and defined, society is essential to the individual's awareness of his own individuality. The individual cannot express himself fully except in relation to the broader community. The broader context of society enables the individual to become conscious of his particularity; it gives him the background that enables him to abstract himself from the whole. It is through society that a person's place in the community is definitively recognized and that he comes to see what he has it in himself to be. The ideal relation between society and the individual is a dynamic one, according to which mutual adjustment occurs between society and the various individuals that compose it. Freedom, according to this conception, means more than merely the absence of coercion. It also involves a willing identification with a community. Societies bonded by this feeling of identification require a level of togetherness that is dialogic rather than aggregate, a matter of what we share in the sense of "for us," rather than a mere convergence of interest. Sharing is itself a noninstrumental value in the context of such a society, extending beyond the merely convergent interests of a collection of individuals. The laws of that society have to be seen as reflecting extensions of its collective self. Some Reservations Clearly, the preferred political culture of communitarianism is much more compatible than that of the extreme liberal with traditional religious values, in calling upon human beings to become covenant keepers, and in tying the Moral Life, ed. Nancy L. Rosenblum (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989); Allen E. Buchanan, "Assessing the Communitarian Critique of Liberalism," Ethics 99 (July 1989): 852-882.</page><page sequence="46">106 TAMAR ROSS right to maximize their potential for happiness to their responsibility for a covenanted partnership with other human beings. However, even the modem secular communitarian would most likely take issue with R. Kook's toleration position on several accounts. To begin with, he would say that there is simply no working analogy of a national community as R. Kook describes it. First of all, R. Kook's account of the nature and role of the nation unrealistically equivocates between the mythic or metaphysical and the empirical. Even on a purely metaphysical level, the concept of a collective national quality is problematic. How does this metaphysical quality relate to the individual, whose qualities are genetically determined? And on an empiric level, a nation is neither a "will" nor a personality. Nor can the national unit be properly compared to an organism. National communities are products of law and of historical accident, whereas the analysis given by R. Kook is ahistorical. It ignores the role of real life and the actual impact of practical politics. Secondly, R. Kook's view of nationalism fails to distinguish between the ethnic concept of nation and the modern political notion of state, which often includes overlapping boundaries or competing loyalties both within the state and without, e.g., between church and state, or between minority churches and the official one. It specifically overlooks the possibility of a situation where the nation is composed of various ethnic and religious groups that are not all Jewish, and the only possible common morality remaining may be the physical protection of its citizens. If religious paternalism is to be condoned at all in such a state, then it must evidence equal concern for the observance of all religions. The same criticism can be leveled against R. Kook's account of the specific nature of the Jewish people. Can we identify the characteristic quality of Jewish peoplehood that he posits in the actual, concrete nation of Israel? Does the Jewish nation really exhibit the yearning to reflect the Ultimate in empiric, this-worldly terms? (It is this mixing of the metaphysical and the historical that brings R. Kook to speak of a latent uniqueness that does not always manifest itself overtly, thus transforming his theory of the uniqueness of the Jewish people into a statement that can never be falsified."5 When the facts deny it, we can say that it still lies buried deep within the 115. Eliezer Goldman, "The Structuring of Rabbi Kook's Thought (1906-1909)" (Hebrew), Bar Ilan Annual 22-23 (1987): 115-116.</page><page sequence="47">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 107 Jewish soul, and will emerge with the proper conditions. No time limit is spelled out.) Although the secular communitarian may sympathize with R. Kook's societal extension of the Millian principle, he will nevertheless object to violation of the rule of neutrality beyond the value of social cohesion. In his view, R. Kook's appeal for toleration on the part of the secularists merely masquerades as neutral by assuming a utilitarian garb, but is nevertheless un-Millian and partisan in actual fact, for the Millian defender of toleration would make his case without taking sides in the dispute. He may argue, of course, from certain premises, but not from those premises that are part of the very dispute between the contending factions. In the eyes of the secular communitarian, the doctrine of shared interests in social cohesion may be construed as simply a gimmick on the part of the religious whereby public expression of the secularist's embodied values can be declared off-limits as far as the state is concerned, while subtle arguments are discovered to show that the same values, in their unembodied form, are not really secular at all, but truly religious strivings in disguise. The strength of R. Kook's attempt to base the argument for interim toleration on an appeal to a common interest in social cohesion lies in the fact that it temporarily allows each camp to be tolerant for reasons which it recognizes as important to itself. But in actual fact the suggested arrangement is very fragile, for the religious camp is basically maintaining the status quo out of a secret hope that the secularists will eventually come round to share their opinions, whereas all that has really been established in the secular camp is a public policy that has not been internalized. In the long run, this policy requires a more considerable common morality in order to be sustained. Failing this, one side or the other could at any point lose patience and decide that the sacrifice is not worth it. If too much time elapses without any dramatic conversions, the religious may come to question R. Kook's messianic conviction that national unity will eventually cause the religious ideal to prevail. The secularist, on his part, may be prompted to ask: How much can reasonably be expected of us? How long can we be expected to alter our entire lifestyle simply to accommodate the needs of a minority, even when the minority regards its needs as matters of principle? Given the peculiar, heterogeneous character of the modern nation-state, and the fragility of R. Kook's solution in the face of persistent secularism, the modern communitarian may understandably conclude that R. Kook's</page><page sequence="48">108 TAMAR ROSS formula for an abiding sense of community on the national level cannot be effective. Instead of heavily ideological pretensions, perhaps a much more moderate conception of community is called for, based on a starting premise of prudential toleration and the bare minimum of values which all members of the nation can honestly share. As one political philosopher has suggested: "In a liberal pluralist society we can at best have near-universal consensus concerning basic beliefs about justice and toleration. Any stronger sense of community would have to be found in various subnational groups, be they religious, ethnic, political, etc. Moreover, the liberties that are protected in a liberal society should make it possible for people to freely enter these groups and to form strong bonds within them. Thus, it may not be community in some overarching sense, but only a plurality of communities that can be possible in liberal society.""6 Under such a regime, the religious Jew may still continue to retain something of R. Kook's ideological appreciation for toleration. But the basis for this appreciation will not be his metaphysical assumptions regarding the nature of society in general and the Jew in particular, but rather the understanding, shared by modem secularists, that belief of any sort, and particularly religious belief, requires a certain degree of noncoerciveness in order to avoid the danger of hypocrisy, especially in the modern age. His toleration may be bolstered by R. Kook's divergence from the strident truth claims of absolutist religion, but will truly avoid paternalism only if his tentatively assumed version of truth does not presume to include all others, but only to be refined by the dialogue with them. The religious Jew need not give up the traditional belief that eventually all Jews, and all of mankind, will come round to acceptance of Torah. But this belief can be maintained indefinitely alongside secularism only if it is neutralized into a possibility which is deferred to the invisibly distant future, divorced from the urgency of immediate messianic expectations. R. Kook's optimistic belief that ideas do not come to the world by chance, but only when Divine Providence considers mankind to be ready for them, need not be translated into more explicit practical conclusions. Existing secular societies do not tend to remake themselves either in the totally open image of the radical pluralist's dream or in the traditional religionist's paradigm of the closed society. The question is always which 116. David D. Duquette, "Liberal Purposes and Community" (Paper presented at the Ninth Annual Social Philosophy Conference, Davidson College, North Carolina, August 1992).</page><page sequence="49">BETWEEN METAPHYSICAL AND LIBERAL PLURALISM 109 of the two we accept as the ideal toward which we try to move. That is the real issue at stake between the proponents of modern liberal pluralism and its critics, and it expresses itself in the tendency to maximalist or minimalist notions of liberty. R. Kook's toleration theory may be viewed as an original and valiant, but necessarily imperfect, attempt to straddle the two options. As a postscript I would like to add just one more comment. It might be argued"' that the ability of the religious believer to accommodate pluralism as an intrinsic value, as in the second variant of Position 3, and not merely as an important means for discovering truth, as in the first variant of Position 3, really mandates a total revolution regarding the meaning of religious truth statements-viewing these not as literally informative propositions about the world, God, and history that can be simply verified or falsified empirically, but as tools for establishing or expressing a set of values uncommitted to any hard-and-fast metaphysical or ontological assumptions. One of the least noted and appreciated aspects of R. Kook's thought is the originality and modernity of his approach in precisely this area. We have already noted R. Kook's view of truth formulations as propositions that are liable to continual refinement ad infinitum. Even though they may not share R. Kook's harmonistic view of truth as a hierarchy of valid opinions that relate in varying degrees to a common root, this view is similar in its epistemological modesty to that of the critical cognitivists promoting the first form of Position 3. But there is another aspect of R. Kook's view of truth, extending beyond the fallibilism of the critical cognitivists and approximating more recent approaches to the philosophy of science and to epistemology, that fosters the second form of Position 3. This consists of R. Kook's awareness of the limitations implicit in any finite formulation of reality, and his understanding of the search for truth more as a matter of paradigms accepted and rejected in terms of their suitability to the current spiritual and moral needs of the specific community concerned, than of certainty, proof, and even irreversible disproof. R. Kook, however, never understood this view of truth as grounds for pure relativism, or reduction of religious commitment. All that it meant for him was that instead of facticity being the ultimate test of "truth" in the religious sense, the real measure of such statements is pragmatic; i.e., the extent to which they lend significance to the values they strive to embody and contribute to their flourishing. 117. See Sagie, "Jewish Religion."</page><page sequence="50">110 TAMAR ROSS Moreover, R. Kook did not develop these ideas in the form of a rigorously articulated and full-blown philosophy; its kernels can only be gathered from various significant instances where he implemented this view in practice in order to assess the relative validity of rival truth claims. But it is this aspect of R. Kook's thought, if it ever were to be absorbed fully into the mainstream thinking of traditional Judaism, that might provide the unexpected impetus for a new climate of discourse, and the exploration of fresh modes of accommodation by the religious camp to the modem secular liberal outlook, on grounds that lie beyond the prudential. On the other hand, perhaps the good health of popular religion requires that this possibility too remain a messianic dream that is best deferred to the invisibly distant future. At any rate, all this is already material for another topic and another paper. Tamar Ross Bar Ilan University Dept. of Philosophy</page></plain_text>
