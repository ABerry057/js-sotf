Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. x, 186 pp. Four years ago, when I first read Bonnie Morris' Lubavitcher Women in America, the book was in manuscript form and I was directing a women's studies program at a regional university in Kentucky. As a Jewish feminist educator, I was asked by SUNY Press to review the book and make a recommendation about pub- lication. The ultra-Orthodox represent a closed community: difficult to observe from the outside and rarely reported on from the inside, and I was fascinated by Morris' study of Lubavitcher women's postwar contributions to the spiritual life and growth of their Hasidic community. Along with another reviewer, I recom- mended publication, and the book came out in late 1998. Just under two years lat- er, I again read Lubavitcher Women in America for the purpose of writing this re- view. What has changed is not my high regard for this skilled examination of the impact of American feminism on the lives and roles of women within this partic- ular Hasidic community. Rather, it is my proximity to ultra-Orthodoxy. I now find myself living in Brooklyn, New York. On my daily commute to the university at which I teach, I pass through the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, ground zero for Morris' research. While living in Kentucky, it was easy for me to regard the ultra-Orthodox as an abstraction: they were simply the keepers of their form of the faith. While I had always been simultaneously in- trigued and nonplussed by their way of life, I never had to give them any space- literally or figuratively-in my daily life. Now things are very different. As I watch a young married woman cross Eastern Parkway pushing a double baby stroller ful- ly loaded with twins and groceries, and holding onto the hand of an older child who leads two littler ones, I question who is best served by ultra-Orthodox Ju- daism's understanding of women's roles. As an American feminist, I cannot quite accept that Lubavitcher women ben- efit within what I will always perceive as a matrix of male privilege and hegemo- ny. However, while Morris' book once merely informed me of the details of post- war life and activism for Hasidic women, it now serves to remind me that these women I see on a daily basis are seeking fulfillment, as they understand it, through an ultra-Orthodox design for living, and that this is a form of liberation. Morris is careful to place her account of these women's experiences in a post-Holocaust con- text. In the aftermath of annihilation, it makes more sense that the Jewish women most touched by the destruction would see rebuilding the Jewish people (through motherhood and support of traditional Judaism) as a sacred and honored opportu- nity. Specifically, Morris' research documents the unexpected interplay of femi- nism and what she calls "counter-feminism" on the lives of these ultra-Orthodox women. While sex roles, ritual, and religious thinking among Lubavitchers re- mained unaltered, the issues raised by the women's movement were paralleled in the Lubavitcher community by the increased role women began to play as activists and educators. In terms of both Jewish and feminist study and scholarship, this is an interesting, ironic, and unexpected outcome of American feminism. In a sense, feminism raised the question of female fulfillment, thus providing Lubavitcher 403</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review women with an opportunity to answer it by saying that what women are "sup- posed" to do Jewishly is what will make them happy. While feminism, by Morris' account, has made no dent in what I consider to be the wholesale privileging of male spirituality, needs, and desires in ultra-Or- thodox Judaism, it may have made a welcome improvement in the lives of ba 'alot teshuvah (new adherents to Hasidism). These women, once on the margins of Ha- sidic life until sufficiently enculturated to marry, are now encouraged, as Morris documents it, to use the "emptiness" of their secular accomplishments as a re- cruiting tool for reaching the hearts and minds of still-secular Jewish women who have doubts about the meaningfulness of their lives. This is not anti-feminist back- lash, this is counter-feminist whiplash. Ba 'alot teshuvah now serve as smart, ar- ticulate, informed, and effective recruiters for the late Rebbe's vision and version of Jewish life. What feminist irony! That Morris' study examines, from a feminist perspective, a population of women who feel they have no commerce with feminism may strike some as inap- propriate. Certainly researcher Susan Faludi has been criticized for studying men through a similar lens (Stiffed: The Betrayal ofAmerican Men, 1999). To my way of thinking, however, Morris' work invites further use of contemporary feminist theory as an interpretive tool. I appreciate the respect with which she treated this complicated community, and the respect her work inspires. Jeanne Henry Hofstra University Hempstead, New York 404</page></plain_text>
