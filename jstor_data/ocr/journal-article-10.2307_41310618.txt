The present study was born of other circumstances: I was asked by the directors of the early music group Ensemble Lucidarium1 if, for purposes of performance, I knew of a translation of Samuel Archivolti's Hebrew wedding ode "Kehi kinnor" (Take a lyre). I had run across the ode in various listings,2 but was unfamiliar with any trans- lation, so I suggested doing my own. That is where the problems began. To establish a clean reading for the poem, I consulted its manuscript and printed sources; to con- front its verbal obscurities, and pinpoint its meanings, I traced its references to biblical and rabbinical literature; and to satisfy my own curiosity about how it was sung, I looked into the few recorded examples of its melodies. It follows that in this article, I shall be concerned mainly with semantics and music. Yet, to begin, I shall present some information about the author, sources, and prosody of the poem; and, to conclude, I shall compare it with other wedding odes of his and his contemporaries, and, in an epilogue, appraise its' singularity. For the poem as numbered for its lines and footnoted for its citations, the reader should consult the threefold transcription (Hebrew, transliteration, and All translations, here and below, are the author's. I wish to thank Professor Dvora Bregman for graciously responding to my request to read and comment on this study. Her suggestions for its improvement were invaluable. 1 .

References below to its verses (e.g., 3.2 or R.l, R standing for refrain) are to the numbering found there. For details about its manuscript and printed sources, see Appendix 2. A number of ideas emerge from reading "Kehi kinnor." The first is that it is almost impossible, in the Hebrew tradition, to separate poetry from music. Their conjunction was evident in David's psalms and, after their precedent, in the post- biblical piyyut. It is a conjunction based on the primacy of song in the ritual of the Temple and, through the cantillation of Scriptures, in the prayer services of the synagogue. A second idea is that music underlies all forms of Jewish celebration, of which one of the most salient examples, from the sixteenth century on, is the wedding ode. It is no wonder that so many poets tried their hand at its composition. A third is that Hebrew poetry, like music, can be perused and understood on many levels. There is no better example than "Kehi kinnor" - its words and melodies are rich in their semantic plurality. Voices (kolot) that pertain to music and speech, as made clear from the ode, also pertain to rejoicing in its literal and metaphorical demonstration - from praising the bride and groom in song under the wedding canopy to symbolizing the voices that preceded the revelation of Torah as an epi- phany. The wedding that, in this and other odes, validates the union of man and woman also connotes the union of God with His people. Fourth, and last, is that the ode has much to tell us about its author - the verses and his comments to them, beyond revealing his erudition, show the centrality of words and sounds to his notions of poetry, and to his search for meaning in the sources. "Kehi kinnor" is an exercise in exegesis for both the author and the reader. It defines the Jews in relation to past and future, from the glories of the Temple to the hope for better times when, with the return from captivity, all will "deliver a song ... to the Supreme God" (7.1). Author, sources, prosody Author Born in Cesena in the region of Emilia Romagna around 1530, Samuel ben Elhanan Jacob Archivolti lived, from 1568 until his death in 1611, in Padua. There, in addition to proofreading for publishing houses in Venice, he served the Jewish community as secretary, head of a yeshiva, and after 1579, rabbi. His activities can be reconstructed from the people and situations mentioned in his letters and rabbinical responses.3 Three of his four larger works were published in the 1550s. Degel ahava [Banner of Love]4 is a story designed to illustrate the behavioral traits of suitors as they pass through the various states of amorous desire - hope, joy, suffering, and despair - to avoid which Archivolti advises that they spend their time studying and that they actuate love through marriage 3. For a recent summary monograph, see Dror Schwarz, "Rabbi Shemu'el Arkivolti - toldotav u-khetavav, she'elot u-teshuvot ve-igrot" [Rabbi Samuel Archivolti: His Biography and Writings, Questions and Responses, and Letters], Asufot, sefer shanah le-mada'ei ha-yahadut 7 (1993): 69- 156 (esp. 69-81 for biography and 81-86 for overview of writings). 4.

His fourth and most influential work, 'Arugat ha-bosem [Bed of Spices],6 treats Hebrew grammar and, in its last chapter, Hebrew verse forms, which the author illustrates with twenty-seven examples of his own composition (1602). 7 To these poems one may add another fifty-four variously published in his or others' works (often as dedications in the latter) or, in the case of "Kehi kinnor," in prayer books.8 Archivolti has been called "a poet [who], acclaimed in his own time and in the generation following him, may perhaps be described, to a certain extent, as a pioneer and founder of the 'new' Hebrew poetry in Italy"9 - "new" referring to the cultivation of Italian verse forms, among them the sonnet (which, though introduced by Immanuel ha-Romi around 1300, dwindled there- after, only to be revived in the sixteenth century), and to a heightened concern with the sonority of end rhymes.10 The inclusion of "Kehi kinnor" (not a sonnet) along with at least three other of his poems in prayer books may be taken as a shibboleth for their popularity.11 Leon Modena wrote of Archivolti, 5. After Song of Songs 4:16, opening words. 6. After Song of Songs 5:13: " Lehayav ka- 'arugat ha-bosem " (His cheeks are as a bed of spices). 7. Some of the examples are extended, while others have only one or two distichs; ' Arugat ha-bosem (Venice: Zuan Degara, 1602), chap. 32, "Be-darkhei ha-shirim" [On the Prosody of Verse], fols. llla-119b {recte 118b). 8. There is no edition or full discussion of his poems. Nor is their exact number known. Examples, with comments thereon, can be found in Dvora Bregman, "Sheloshah 'asar sonettim le-Rabbi Shemu'el Arkivolti" [Thirteen Sonnets by Rabbi Samuel Archivolti], Italia: studi e ricerche sulla storia, la cultura e la letteratura degli ebrei d'ltalia 1 (1988): 29-65, and, for the same ones, Bregman, ed., Zeror zehuvim: sonettim 'ivriyyim mi-tekufat ha-Renesans ve-ha-Barok (Jerusalem and Beer-Sheva: Ben-Zvi Institute and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 1997), 94-110; Jefim Schirmann, Mivhar ha-shirah ha- 'ivrit be-Italyah [An Anthology of Hebrew Poetry in Italy] (Berlin: Schocken, 1934), 25 1-55 (four examples, without discussion); and Simon Bernstein, "Shirim hadashim le-Rabbi Shemu'el Arkivolti" [New Poems by Rabbi Samuel Archivolti], Tarbiz 8 (1937): 55-68 (four- teen examples, originally in manuscript; see below). Of the eighty-one works that I was able to trace from references in secondary sources, sixty-seven are variously tabulated for their titles and sources in Davidson, Ozar ha-shirah ve-ha-piyyut (as above). 9.

One of the three is for circumcision ("Arzei Levanon yifrehu"), another a prayer for burial ("Yehi razon mi-le-fanekha, Adonai Eloheinu ve-Elohei avoteinu, she-yikhbeshu rahamekha et ka'askha"), and the third for recitation as a selihah ("Seridei 'am asher nif am"). 255</page><page sequence="4">Don Harran his teacher, in an epitaph for Archivolti's tombstone, that he was "a master of elegant rhymes: the language of the Hebrews will mourn over him."12 Autograph A manuscript copy of "Kehi kinnor" was inscribed in the author's hand on the recto of the endleaf (followed by a blank flyleaf) of Sefer ha-shorashim [Book of Roots], a biblical dictionary that David Kimhi (d. ca. 1255) prepared as Part 2 of his Sefer mikhlol [An All-Inclusive Book] on Hebrew grammar. Archivolti, who owned Sefer ha-shorashim in its Venetian print by Giustinian (1546), combined it with his copy of Sefer mikhlol printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg (1545; on its title page he writes of having purchased it, for "eight Venetian pounds," in 1553) and had both of them bound together in leather with his name gold- stamped on the back cover (in Latin letters, as Semuel de Archevolti).13 The volume, in its two parts, is now in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.14 Beyond "Kehi kinnor," Archivolti inscribed seventeen other orig- inal poems variously on the preliminary flyleaf (of Sefer mikhlol , before the title page) and on the final printed folio (verso) and following two leaves (of Sefer ha-shorashim). It has been estimated, from the dates for the three obituary epitaphs among them, that Archivolti wrote out the full set no earlier than 15 84, 15 which year might be fixed as the terminus a quo for "Kehi kinnor."16 The autograph forms the basis of the transcription in Appendix 1 (see there, Figure 2, for a reproduction). Its importance is unassailable. For one, it establishes an authentic textual reading, thus solving problems of discrepancy or uncertainty in the sources.17 For another, it refers, in the inscription, to the person who requested 12. "Sar be-shirim mehudarim / leshon 'ivrim tispod 'alav" (the verb li-sepod, beyond "to mourn," also means "to eulogize"): from "Eikha yu'am pe'er kol 'am" (How the splendor of every people will dull), in the Divan le-Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh mi-Modena [The Divan of Rabbi Leon Modena], ed. Simon Bernstein (after Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Mich. 528) (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1932), 209-210 (line 11). The poem has the following inscrip- tion: "A lament over the death of the gaon (great scholar), my teacher and master, his honored eminence Rabbi Samuel Archivolti, may his saintly memory be blessed!" 13. " 'La-Adonai ha-arez u-melo'ah': miknat kaspei Shemu'el ben kevod ma'alat Rabbi Elhanan Ya'akov min ha-Arkivolti yishmerehem Zuram u-vi-yehayyehem shenat shayag li-ferat katan be'ad het litra viniziyya"("The earth and its fullness is the Lord's" [Psalms 24:1]: a purchase of Samuel, son of his honored eminence Rabbi Elhanan Jacob of the Archivoltis - may the Rock pre- serve them and give them life! - in the year 1553 for eight Venetian pounds). 14. Details on the volume and its location can be found in Bernstein, "Shirim hadashim," 55-56: I thank Dr. Jay Rovner, manuscript bibliographer at the library of the Seminary, for their corroboration (the volume is currently shelved under the identifier SHF 1987:13). Its other owners, after Archivolti, were Samuel Ungar (early nineteenth century?; signature on title page), Joseph Ungar (1828-1913, poss- ibly Samuel's son; signature on front flyleaf), and Mayer Sulzberger ( 1 843-1 923 ; bookplate - Sulzberger gave his collection of Hebrew books, including the volume by Kimhi, to the Seminary in 1902). 15. See Bernstein, "Shirim hadashim," 56. 16. For other manuscript copies, from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, see Appendix 2. 17. Discrepancies in wording, as, e.g., in 3.2, between ve-hen hen lah and ve-hen hen lah , or in spelling (open versus deficient); uncertainties, as, e.g., in 2.2, where all sources (including autograph) have le-mappelah , though mi-mappelah would seem more logical (see note to the verse in Appendix 1). 256</page><page sequence="5">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti that Archivolti write the poem, "Rabbi Isaac Luzzatto," a name omitted from other versions.18 For a third, it has an emendation (in 3.2), of philological interest: Archi- volti deletes ve-shikhlulah (and her beauty), replacing it with ve-hen hen lah (with all her graces). For a fourth, it clarifies the verse structure in its ordering as a series of distichs (see below). Its major importance, however, lies in the comments that Archivolti added to several lines in explication of their content and reference to his sources.19 The only two drawbacks to the autograph are the author's omission of vowel points from the verses, and not his, but someone else's excision of the comments to the last two distichs (Figure 2 reveals how the paper was cut and pasted over the larger folio). Though the vowel points can easily be supplied from the rules for Hebrew vocalization as modified, here and there, by the scansion of the verse,20 the absence of the final comments, presuming there were such com- ments, is unfortunate. The poem is abstruse and further remarks of the author would have been useful for its elucidation. For four manuscript copies of the poem, one from the mid-eighteenth century - of particular interest because it is inscribed as to be sung to "the tune [of] 'Aftir lashon' (I will release my tongue)" by David Pardo (d. 1790)21 - and three from the nineteenth, see Appendix 2. Printed Sources "Kehi kinnor" appears a number of times in printed formularies intended for practical use in Italian-Jewish communities. They are variously entitled Davar be- 'itto [Everything in its Time], Siddur mi-berakhah [Siddur with Blessings], and Siddur berakhah [Siddur of Blessings]. The poem can be traced to at least thir- teen such formularies from 1618 to 1739. They served different rites, mostly benei Roma (nine prints, starting from 1618; see Figure l),22 yet also Ashkenazi (three prints),23 and possibly Sephardi (one print).24 From its exclusion from an early 18. About Luzzatto, see below, under "Semantics." 19. Specifically, 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6.2 (see Appendix 1). 20. In six instances: see Appendix 1. 21. The melody could not be traced. For the poem, however, see Eliezer ben Shem Tov Papo, Sefer appei zutrei [Book of Small Faces] (Sarajevo: n.p., 1876), 149-50. While it is metrically identical to Archivolti 's, it differs from it in the number of its distichs and in not having a refrain. See details (and transcription of first distich) under Appendix 2. 22.

Davar be- 'itto, 1653, or so presumed from its publication in Leghorn, though there is no indication of the ritual affiliation in the title or contents. "Kehi kinnor" was excluded from Siddur bera- khah "according to the sacred rite of Sefarad," 1617, and its use in Sephardic wedding celebrations remains an open question.

(Courtesy, Jerusalem, National Library of Israel, shelf mark R 0 75 A 689) Siddur mi-berakhah dated 1578, perhaps the first in that series,25' one may assume its composition in the later sixteenth or early seventeenth century (see above, under Autograph, for its earliest plausible date). Harran, "Review Essay: In Search of the Italian Sephardic Tradition," Musica Judaica 17 (2003-2004): 165-95. 25. See Appendix 2. 258</page><page sequence="7">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti Prosody "Kehi kinnor" consists of a refrain and four stanzas, with the refrain return- ing after each one.26 The verses are composed as distichs, or two-line units, nine in all (one for the refrain, two for the individual stanzas). Each line divides into four feet, with two in the first hemistich and two in the second (Archivolti marks the midpoint, or break between the hemistiches, by a caesura; see Figure 2). Of iden- tical construction, the feet read quantitatively as a short plus three longs, or more precisely, a peg (yated ), that is, short-long, plus two cords (tenu 'ot)9 that is, longs, in a meter known as marnin (joyous).27 The lines are counted, after the example of Italian verse, by their syllables, in this case eight for each hemistich. Line 1 of distich 4, at the beginning of stanza 2, may serve as example. It separates metri- cally into a fixed number of syllables ordered by duration (as shorts and longs, according to the underlying quantitative paradigm, though both, in the "new" Italian Hebrew verse, are of equal measure) or by tonic stress (in patterns of iambs). Distich 4, line 1 (or as numbered in transcription, 3.1), with its composite feet, reads thus: Marked for their duration : ^-vl-t'ru'ah ' 2gedol de'ah / 3yehl sovev ' 4ke-Ish tohen Marked for their accents : ^-vi-t'ru'ah 2gedol de'ah / 3yehi sovev ' 4ke-ish tohen The rhyme scheme for the refrain and stanzas would lead one to describe the verses as a seeming girdle poem (shir ezor). In each stanza the last line repeats the end rhyme of the refrain (-lah) while lines 1-3 of the separate stanzas have their own rhymes (rah or ra for stanza 1, hen for stanza 2, nam for stanza 3, and to for stanza 4).28 26. Not so in Amsterdam, Gans, MS D 68, where the initial distich does not return. In Siddur mi-berakhah, 1693, and London, Valmadonna, MS 122, the refrain is repeated not only after each set of two distichs but also immediately after its opening statement. 27. Most sources for "Kehi kinnor" indicate the verses as distichs, but not Amsterdam, Gans, MS D 68, where the hemistiches appear on separate lines, thus not two lines for the distichs, but four. For the meter marnin, see Pagis, Hidush u-masoret be-shirat ha-hol ha-'ivrit , 119; also Bregman, ed., Zeror zehuvim, 553, where the same meter is classified as taz milra' (sixteen syllables to verses ending on an oxytone), or better, according to Bregman in various studies (e.g., Essa et levavi [see the section "Wedding Odes by Archivolti and his Contemporaries"], 326), as het milra kaful (eight syllables ending on an oxytone doubled for each hemistich). A typical example is the hymn "Adon 'olam asher malakh / be-terem kol yezlr nlvra" (sung variously at the beginning of the morning service on weekdays and the Sabbath, before the benedictions and pesukei de-zimra , and at the close of the evening service on the Sabbath). 28. The stanzas are in effect quatrains, of which "Kehi kinnor" has four (1.1-2.2, 3.1-4.2, 5.1- 6.2, 7. 1-8.2) introduced and followed by a refrain. Since the end rhyme of the refrain returns in the last line of each quatrain, the overall construction resembles a "girdle." Yet the traditional medieval Spanish shir ezor , about which see Pagis, Hidush u-masoret be-shirat ha-hol ha- ' ivrit , 13 1-40, did not have a refrain; rather, its recurrent rhymes are in its ever changing verses. 259</page><page sequence="8">Don Harran Semantics For whom did Archivolti compose the verses? In the inscription to the auto- graph, he informs us that he wrote them as a "piyyut for a groom and a bride . . . upon the request of Rabbi Isaac Luzzatto," who may be assumed to be the same Luzzatto in whose house in Venice Leon Modern's family resided after fleeing the earthquake in Ferrara (1570)29 and Leon himself was born (1571).30 Luz- zatto31 no doubt intended it for a specific bride and groom, though no names are mentioned (unless perhaps their initials or other identifying marks are cleverly woven into the verses).32 He is likely to have presided as rabbi over the wedding ceremony and to have been the "great man of learning" to whom Archivolti referred in verse 3.1. Luzzatto 's name is absent from the remaining sources, yet most of them inscribe the poem, after the autograph, as a piyyut for "a groom and a bride" (hatan ve-kallah )33 (when rubrics are given in Italian, sposo e sposa)?A for "a wedding couple" ( hatanim )35 (in Italian rubrics, sposi ),36 or, less specifically, 29. Before returning, some eight months later, to Ferrara: see Modena, Sefer hayyei Yehudah [The Book of the Life of Judah], ed. Daniel Carpi (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1985), 37-38, or in an English translation by Mark R. Cohen, The Autobiography of a Seventeenth-Century Venetian Rabbi: Leon Modena 's Life of Judah, with historical notes by Howard E. Adelman and Benjamin Ravid (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), 81-82 (and for reference to Luzzatto, 193). 30. Leon, at the age of ten, was sent to Padua to study with Archivolti, whose influence as teacher over the course of a single year was to "shape Modena's activities for the rest of his life": cf. Howard Adelman, "Success and Failure in the Seventeenth-Century Ghetto of Venice: The Life and Thought of Leon Modena" (PhD diss., Brandeis University, 1985), 213. 3 1 . Of the various families in Venice, Luzzatto 's was mentioned by David de Pomis, in the later 1580s, as "distinguished": its members "increased and multiplied in wealth and honor, especially the important and outstanding paterfamilias [ kazin ], his honored eminence Rabbi Isaac, son of the honored, eminent sage Rabbi Lucio (may he rest in peace!)": Zemah David [David's Plant] (Venice: Zuan de Gara, 1587), fol. 5b, from "Hakdamat ha-sefer" (Introduction to the book). For Isaac Luzzatto, overshone by his son Simone (who wrote the remarkable Discorso circa il stato de gl'Hebrei, 1638, and, along with Modena, officiated as rabbi in Venice until his death in 1663), see the "Notizie storico- lettararie sulla famiglia Luzzatto," etc., at the beginning of Samuele David Luzzatto 's Autobiografia (Padua: Tip. Crescini, 1882), esp. 10-11. Isaac died in 1645 at the age of 95; La comunita ebraica di Venezia e il suo antico cimitero, ed. Aldo Luzzatto, 2 vols. (Milan: II polifolo, 2000), 2:1033. 32. Dvora Bregman suggested the possibility of reading eitan (1.1, translated there as "strong") as a metonym for Abraham. Her point might be sustained by reference to various sources. Psalms 89, e.g., has "A maskil for Ethan {eitan) the Ezrahite" in verse 1, yet emphasizes the covenant that God made with His people (originally through Abraham, see Genesis 17:10-12) in verses 4, 29, and 34 (Abraham was "strong" in his faith, not wavering under God's command to sacrifice his son Isaac). For Ethan the Ezrahite as Abraham, see B. Baba Batra 15a; Rashi, commenting on 1 Kings 5:11 (where Solomon is said to be wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, i.e., Abraham); and Zohar 2, Exodus, Para- shat "Mishpatim," fol. 101a. 33 .Davarbe-'itto, 1653; Siddur mi-berakhah, 1618, 1623, 1627 (presumably; see Appendix 2), 1641, 1673, 1693. 34.

If not Isaac Luzzatto, "the great man of learning" may, in this case, have been the groom himself, schooled in Torah and setting an example thereby for his "attendants" (again l.l).39 One other protago- nist might be mentioned, not as a recipient but as an active participant: the "con- gregation," or Jewish community, called upon, in the vocative, at the outset ("Take a lyre, . . . O congregation," R.l). It is the "created people" (1.2), who, toward the end, speak out in first-person plural ("Let us deliver a song," 7. 1). In a sense, there is no contradiction between recipients and participants. The groom and bride are individual members of the community, and the wish for their welfare coincides with that for the welfare of the Jews as a "people" (God "will spare the people who are troubled," 7.2). The ode would have been sung before the Seven Blessings pronounced under the wedding canopy and after saying grace at the wedding banquet on the same day. Should the festivities continue, it would have been repeated on succes- sive days.40 Its main theme is gladness ("joy," "merriment," "rejoicing," "jubila- tion," "cheerfulness," "happiness")41 for the bride and groom and, vicariously, for the congregation, both now and in years to come (about which more below). Music, along with dance, enters the picture as a natural vehicle for celebration ("Take a lyre, lift your joy ... in a voice of merriment," "sing many songs . . . to the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride," "may the voices ... be given to a created people," "Let us deliver a song," "How do they dance before the bride?") 42 In the background are the passages in Samuel where David "took a lyre" (R.l) to relieve Saul of his melancholy43 or where he "danced before the Lord,"44 and more significantly in the Book of Psalms where praises of God are effected by "lifting" voices and instruments ("Rejoice unto God . . . lift your song and use a timbrel, a pleasant lyre with a psaltery"),45 by exulting ("Sing a new song unto Him, play your best in jubilation"),46 and by dancing 37.

The musical imagery of Psalms was commonplace in postbiblical Hebrew poetry. Joseph Jedidiah Carmi (flourished in the early seventeenth century) composed a piyyut, for example, with words strongly reminiscent of the refrain in Archivolti's wedding ode. Its verses 1-2 read: "Be comforted, O congregation, and a lyre and psaltery/ Take in your hands and lift a song to your Maker."48 The reason why music was a source of delight not only to God but also to humans was explained by Judah Moscato (d. 1590) as having to do with their intrinsic musical construction. "All those called by His name and for His honor," Moscato wrote, "did He create, form, and even make according to the ratios of music, just as He Himself - may He be blessed! - is the master of perfect music. In His wisdom He formed man in His image, after His likeness, as most ordered in harmonic relations." Therefore it behooves us, he continues, quoting Psalms 98:5, to "sing to the Lord with a lyre, with a lyre and a voice of song."49 Archivolti departs from the practice, in most wedding odes, of identifying the groom and bride in the inscription or the contents.50 Rather he delineates their ideal traits. The groom, he implies, pursued studies of "Torah" (and, by insin- uation, its talmudic and rabbinical commentaries), and thus penetrated its "secrets" (1.1). In another, anonymous wedding ode, two folios away from Archivolti's in one of the sources, the groom is described, "on the day of [his] wedding, [as] a vest of wisdom and much understanding."51 It is no wonder that he is "honored" (4.2). His bride, in her "splendor" and "graces," "glow[s]" in "her loveliness" (3.2).52 Though plain in appearance ("not by being powdered or painted"; see comments to 4.1 and 4.2), she "attain[s] majesty" as a "graceful gazelle" (4.1) in the eyes of her husband who stands "across from her" (4.2). His role is to "honor her" and, by 47. Psalms 149:3 (see also 150:4). 48. "Hitnahami 'edah ve-khinnor nevel / likhi be-yad u-s"i le-konekh zemer" (from the first of six stanzas formed as hendecasyllabic octaves with the rhyme scheme abababcc ).

The implication is that the groom glows as well; see Daniel 12:3 ("The wise will glow like the glow of the firmament"). Thus it was said of the bride, in the second wedding ode just mentioned, "how pleasant was the glow of her beauty" (stanza 3); and of the groom, "how pleasant was the glow of his appearance" (stanza 2). 262</page><page sequence="11">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti so doing, he guarantees a happy marriage, and hence becomes "enriched" (see comment to 5.1). The poet goes on to augur their destiny. Their wedding contract, or ketub- bah , to which "two uncles," i.e., beloved ones53 "of eminence" appear to have been witnesses, assures them of "peace in their dwelling" (5.1 and comment thereto).54 The wife will see to it that her husband lacks for nothing. She "will serve" him "without idleness" (6.2 and comment thereto)55 and bear him "many sons" (5.2). They, too, will "know no scarcity in their prosperity" (5.2) and, because of their success in producing "oil" and "wine," will ever be "cheerful" and "happy" (6.1). From the well-being of husband, wife, and sons, the poet deduces the future of the "congregation" (R.l), conceived as encompassing the Jews as a whole. The link between the family nucleus and the larger national or religious entity appears to reside in the "contract of peace" (berit shalom ; in a broader sense, "covenant of peace") attested by the "two uncles," i.e., beloved ones. Archivolti may be refer- ring to the "two" tablets on which the Ten Commandments were engraved or, by analogy, the "two" rollers for holding the scrolls of the Law in the sanctuary. The vocabulary matches Ezekiel 37:26: "I will make a covenant of peace [berit shalom ] with them, and it will be an everlasting covenant [berit ' olam ] with them . . . and I will put my sanctuary in their midst forever." The future of the Jewish people lies in its renewal. By strengthening the con- nection with Torah (1.1 and comment thereto) and rebuilding the sanctuary (2.2, and comments to 2.1 and 2.2; 8.1-2), they will enjoy "peace" (5.1); they will mul- tiply, having "many sons" (5.2);56 and they will "prosper" (5.2) and know "happi- ness" (6.1). Though "troubled" from exile and dispersion, they will eventually be "spare[d]" (7.2) and, in better times, they will return to offer sacrifices in the Temple, rebuilt after its destruction (2.1-2 and comments thereto, 8.1-2). Pieces of the puzzle now begin to fit together. The gladness of the bride and groom foreshadows the return from captivity and a "sacrifice of thanksgiving" in God's house.57 The people will faithfully serve the Lord, as does the wife her husband (6.2 and comment thereto). The "oil" and "wine" (6.1) cultivated by the bride's and groom's "many sons" (5.2) - to be read as Jews in generations to come - are tropes for joy and radiance ("Wine will gladden man's heart and oil will make his face shine," Psalms 104:15). It is no wonder that the sons are 53. See Song of Songs 5:1. 54. The same beloved ones would have flanked the bride and groom under the huppah (wedding canopy), where they read out the stipulations of the contract.

As did the "virtuous wife" ( eshet hayil) in Proverbs 31:12 ("She will remunerate him with good, not evil, all the days of her life"). 56.

"Oil," of course, had sacred usages, as in the anoint- ing of high priests and sacred vessels.58 The passage "I anointed you with oil" (Ezekiel 16:9) was said by the biblical commentator David Kimhi, for example, to denote a "softening of the skin hardened from working with clay and bricks: this is a metaphor [mashal] for the respite they had" from trials and tribulations (cf. 5.1, 7.2). Not only was "wine" imbibed for the kiddush and on festive occasions (among them, in the present context, weddings),59 but it also marked the beginning of a new era signaled in the culmination of the wedding ode (8.1-2). "Behold, the days come," Amos predicted, "and sweet wine will drop from the heavens" (9:13). Stanza 1 is the most difficult to decode. It combines "the secrets of Torah" with other elements: giving "the voices, instead of voices ... to a created people"; "sacrificing the splendor of fattened sheep to an awesome God"; and rebuilding the Temple, after destruction, for its renewed "fame, praise, and glory" (1.1-2.2 and comments thereto). Behind the stanza is a passage from B. Berakhot (6b) that cites Jeremiah 33 : 1 1 for its "five voices": one of joy, one of glad- ness, one of the bridegroom, one of the bride, and one of those who praise the Lord, namely, the "community" (R.l). They are compared to the "five voices," alias sounds preceding the revelation of Torah (thunder, lightning, a shofar, Moses' voice, and God's voice; Exodus 19:16, 19 - see comment to 1.1). Those who attend the wedding and rejoice for the groom60 are said to identify with the voices behind Torah, and thus become privy to its "secrets" (1.1). "Whoever enjoys the wedding meal of the bridegroom," as the passage from Berakhot begins, and does not rejoice with him, does violence to the five voices, for it is said: "The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say 'Give thanks to the Lord of Hosts' " [Jeremiah 33: 1 1]. And if he does gladden him, what is his reward? . . . The privilege of acquiring [the knowledge of] Torah which was given with five voices, for it is said: "And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were voices [of thunder] and [of] lightning and a thick cloud was on the mountain and the [loud] voice of a shofar," etc. [Exodus 19:16], "and the voice of the shofar [became even louder, and Moses spoke] and God answered him with a voice" [Exodus 19:19]. . . . These voices came before the giving of Torah. "The voices, instead of voices, [to] be given to a created people" (1.2) are thus the voices of those who, created by God, rejoice with the bridegroom and, by analogy, rejoice in their Maker for giving them Torah through Moses. They speak not in the voices of thunder, lightning, and so on, that heralded its transmission, but in their own voices that acknowledge its reception and implementation. The same passage 58. See, e.g., Exodus 29:29 and 30:27. 59. Cf. Ecclesiastes 9:7 ("Go and eat your bread happily and drink your wine wholeheartedly, for God has already favored your works"). 60. The poem speaks of "his attendants" (1.1). 264</page><page sequence="13">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti in Berakhot continues by relating how the act of rejoicing can be construed as a sacrifice in the Lord's sanctuary and, after the return from captivity, as a step toward rebuilding it from its wreckage: It is as if he [who rejoices with the bridegroom] made a sacrifice of thanksgiv- ing, for it is said: "They bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the Lord." ... It is as if he restored one of the ruins of Jerusalem, for it is said: "'For I will return the captivity of the land to be as it was at first,' said the Lord" [Jeremiah 33:11]. The obscurities of the poem, as they concern voices, Torah, and sacrifices, are thus lifted.61 But there is a darker side lurking under its surface. The refrain and verses 3.1-2 relate to Isaiah 23:16, namely: "Take a lyre" (Kehi kinnor ); "sing many songs" ( harbi shir); and "circle about the city" (sobbi Hr ), or as varied in the poem, "circle about ... the splendor of the bride" (yehi sovev . . . hadar kallah). Verse 2.2 that describes the destruction of Jerusalem relates further to Isaiah 23:1, 7-9, 1 1 , and 1 5 that describe the destruction of Tyre. But that is where the similarities end. For one thing, in the poem, it was the congregation that the author enjoined to sing and play; in Isaiah 23:16, it was a whore ("Take a lyre, circle about the city, forgotten whore; play well, sing many songs, so that you may be remembered"). For another, in the poem, Jerusalem was ruined, yet rebuilt; in Isaiah 23, Tyre, castigated for its abominations, was razed and left to lie fallow for seventy years, after which it sang as a harlot,62 in order, as one commentator said, "to be remembered by her lovers and thus awaken the attention of merchants to come to her as they did before."63 Archivolti may purposely have generated the parallels as a contrast, for the intuitive reader, between ruin and repair, mourning and rejoicing, exile and return, and captivity and release. They form substructural binaries in Jewish history and Jewish thought. Yes, the Jews knew misery, but Archivolti hastens to assure them that their lot will be improved. The clinching piece of evidence for reading the poem tropologically resides in its function as a song to be performed directly before the Seven Blessings.64 In its vocabulary, the poem can be identified as a paraphrase of Blessing 7, which reads: Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure and delight, 61. Though not completely; see "Epilogue." 62. Isaiah 23:15-16. The most devastating description of iniquitous Tyre occurs in Ezekiel 26-28.

Soon, O Lord our God, may there be heard in the cites of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of youths from their feasts of song. Blessed be You, O Lord, who make the bridegroom rejoice with the bride.65 Like the blessing that presages the voices of joy, love, and peace in the future, so the wedding ode. It implies that to rejoice in the bride and groom is to reaffirm the laws that God gave for the life and preservation of his people for now and evermore. Music To move from the poem to the music to which it was sung is to take a quantum leap from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. The three melodies to which I had access were recorded by Leo Levi (d. 1982) in the 1950s. To my knowledge, they are the earliest, if not the only ones, to be preserved. Whether they can be related to the unknown melody or melodies to which the poem was sung in Archivolti's time is an open question, to which I shall return. Of the three melodies, sung by separate informants, one is Ashkenazi and two are Italiani in their ritual affiliation.66 Since the stanzas are sung to the tune of the refrain, and not all the recordings are textually complete, I shall limit the transcription, for all three, to the refrain. Variants in the reading of the text (by comparison with its reading in Appendix l)67 are those of the singers. With all three melodies in a major mode, I transcribed them, for ease of comparison, in G major. The point, in their quotation here, is to determine their similarities and differences as raw material for answering the "open ques- tion" posed above. The first melody, from Casale Monferrato, appears in Example l.68 There the eight feet of the two lines are clearly separated, usually by an orna- ment on the last syllable of the foot with an extension of its last note69 or, less often, by the extension only.70 Duple meter prevails, with some irregularities (a measure in 5/4 time and five measures in 3/4). Melodically, line 1 circles about G, touching lower and higher pitches of the triad G-B-D (feet 1-2), with 65. The words are a restatement of B. Ketubbot 8a. 66. According to the descriptive data that Levi provided on the file cards for the various items in his collection (his term for Ashkenazi was Tedeschi ). 67. For example, "ha-i" (first melody) instead of "hai," "za-ho-lah" (first) or "zo-ho-lah" (second) instead of "zah-lah," "na-'a-lah" (second) instead of "na'-lah." 68. It was recorded in its refrain (R.l-2), the first distich of stanza 1 (1.1-2), both distichs of stanza 4 (7.1-8.2), and the concluding refrain (R.l-2). 69.

The two lines and their root notes can be summarized thus: 1:1 1:2 1:3 1:4 d'-g'-b'-g'-d' g'-b'-d"-b'-g' b'-b'-b'-b'-b' b'-(a'-g')-f'# 2:1 2:2 2:3 2:4 f'#-(b'-f'#)-e' f'#-a'-d' d"-(c"-b'-a'-g'-f'#-e')-d' g'-(a')-b'-(a')-g' When reduced to essentials, the two lines yield the underlying progression to be seen in Example 2. The second melody, from Alessandria, about 28 kilometers (or 17 miles) from Casale Monferrato, in the same region (Piedmont), yet now from the Italiani rite, appears in Example 3. 71 As in Example 1 , the four feet of the two lines are clearly separated, usually by an ornament on the last syllable of the foot with an extension of its last note72 or, less often, by its extension alone.73 Again the meter is basically duple, though here with fewer irregularities (two measures in 3/4 time).

Melodically, line 1, as before, circles about G, touching lower and higher pitches of the triad G-B-D (feet 1-3, yet now without declaiming on B in the third of them) and ending unexpectedly on an F-sharp, the seventh of the mode (foot 4); line 2 begins on G (and not on F-sharp, as in the previous melody) and in its second foot declaims on A (without touching on F-sharp and D, as before), then emphasizes D (foot 3, through a descending scale from d" to d', as before), closing again on G (foot 4). The two lines and their root notes can be summarized as follows: 1:1 1:2 1:3 1:4 g'_d'-g'-b'-g'-d' g'-b'-d"-g' g'-b'-d" (c"-b'-a')-g'-f'# 2:1 2:2 2:3 2:4 g'-b'-g'-e' (f'#-g')-a'-a'-a'- d"-(c"-b'-a'-g'- g'-(a&gt;b'-(a')-g (b'-c"-b')-a' f'#-g')-d' Clearly, the melody from Alessandria (A) is a variant on the one from Casale Monferrato (C-M) or vice versa. But it is also somewhat less interesting. True, in 74.

Pitigliano, Italiani, after rendition by Azelio Serbi recorded by Leo Levi on 1 7 February 1954. (Courtesy, National Sound Archives, Jerusalem, National Library of Israel, Y/01301, item 2) line 1, C-M and A share a surprising cadence, in foot 4, on F-sharp, which serves as a stimulus for tonal variety at the beginning of line 2. But while C-M, for line 1 , has foot 2 almost artfully repeat the motive of foot 1 up a fourth, and foot 3 intro- duces a declamatory figure for variety's sake, A, less articulated in its motives, has feet 1-3 rather aimlessly sound the pitches of a G triad. As for line 2, C-M starts in foot 1, as if by design, from the F-sharp at the end of line 1, then revolves around a dominant triad in foot 2, leaping up an octave, with dramatic effect, to launch foot 3. Yet A, for the same line, positions its first note more blandly on G, then revolves around A in foot 2, moving up a fourth, not an octave, to foot 3. These are minor differences, however, and may reflect the idiosyncrasies of the performers more than the particularities of separate melodies. When all is said and done, the two melodies are of the same cloth, as can be illustrated by their common substructural pitches (G-F#-E-D-G; see above, Example 2).75 The third melody is from Pitigliano, in the region of Tuscany, and thus is geographically farthest removed from the previous ones - Pitigliano is about 379 kilometers (or 234 miles) away from Casale Monferrato. Like the one from Alessandria, it belongs to the Italiani rite, but its content is different (see above, Example 4). 76 As in the two previous examples, the four feet of the two lines are clearly separated. Unlike them, however, the articulation is generally not achieved through an ornament on the last syllable of the foot with an extension of its last 75. The only difference is that the D, first sounded in measure 12 in the version from Casale Monferrato, is first sounded in measure 1 3 in the one from Alessandria. 76. The melody was recorded in its refrain (R. 1-2), both distichs of stanza 4 (7. 1-8.2), and con- cluding refrain (R.l-2). 269</page><page sequence="18">Don Harran Example 5. The Grundlinie for the melody from Pitigliano note but, with few exceptions, through extension only.77 Indeed, by comparison with the earlier examples, the present one is noticeably less ornamental. Yet the real difference lies in its meter, which is triple (with a few irregularities: 2/4 time in measures 5 and 9, and 4/4 in measure 13). The result is a change in char- acter - the tune is light, joyous, and dancelike, as might befit the revelry of wedding festivities. Melodically, line 1 circles around G, touching on lower and higher notes of its triad (feet 1-2), then moves to the dominant (feet 3^), unlike the earlier melodies in which the dominant was introduced, via F-sharp, at the end (in foot 4); line 2 begins, as is logical, in the dominant (foot 1), then hits on B and D, the third and fifth of a G triad (foot 2), returning even more con- clusively thereafter to G (feet 3^). Unlike the earlier melodies, the one from Pitigliano has no moments of declamation, nor does it have the dramatic leap of an octave found in the one from Casale Monferrato. All in all, the movement for the two lines is conjunct. Its one "surprise" occurs in line 2, with foot 3 ending not on D, but on C; and its one "anomaly" is in the same line, foot 4, which, by comparison with previous feet, seems more breathless, thus depriving the ending of conclusiveness. The two lines and their root notes can be summar- ized thus: 1:1 1:2 1:3 1:4 g'-d'-g' b'-c"-a'-g' f'#-a'-e' f'#-a'-d' 2:1 2:2 2:3 2:4 f'#-a'-(b')-a' b'-d"-c"-b' g'-a'-c" c"-b'-a'-g' When reduced to essentials, they yield the tonal progression in Example 5 (see above). The last example leads back to the question raised at the beginning of this section, namely to what extent can the three melodies to which the poem was sung in the 1950s be related to the one or more hypothetical ones in Archivolti's time? Despite the noticeable melodic, metrical, and rhythmic differences between the Pitigliano melody and the two others, it is clear that all three have the same underlying melodic structure. Bearing this in mind, one might premise, as a reasonable possibility, a prototypical melody for "Kehi kinnor" over an extended period (as was the case, for example, in "Ha-tikvah," which can be traced, under 77. As in the first, second, and fourth feet of line 1 and the first and fourth feet of line 2, respect- ively measures 2, 4, 8, 10, and 15.

Melodies similar to the ones recorded in the 1950s may or may not have been sung in Archivolti 's time. It is more likely that they were. But supposition is clearly no substitute for hard evidence. Wedding Odes by Archivolti and His Contemporaries I limit the purview, under "contemporaries," to Leon Modena (d. 1 648), the author of thirty-five wedding odes (and, as said before, Archivolti 's pupil), and Moses Zacuto (d. 1697), the author of twenty-seven wedding odes.79 Beyond "Kehi kinnor," Archivolti composed at least two others, if not several more, an assumption that can only be sustained when the full extent of his poetry is uncov- ered.80 Despite the few examples at hand, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn from comparing them with those by Modena and Zacuto. Since broader studies on early Hebrew wedding odes are sparsely found in the literature,81 all conclusions here are conditional on further investigation. 78. 1 deal with this, at length, in "The Seventeenth-Century Barabano, a Study in Affinities," in Music Observed: Studies in Memory of William C.

Dvora Bregman (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2009), 59-181 (under "Le-hatunah" [For a wedding]). Modena appears to have been instrumental in commissioning Jacob Segre to compose a wedding ode for Salamone Rossi's collection Ha-shirim as her li-Shelomo (Songs by Solomon) pub- lished in 1623: see Harran, "Marriage and Music as Metaphor: The Wedding Odes of Leon Modena and Salamone Rossi," Musica Judaica 17 (2003-2004): 1-31, and, as it relates to both Modena and the Venetian poet Sarra Copia Sulam, idem, "A Tale as Yet Untold: Salamone Rossi in Venice, 1622," Sixteenth Century Journal 40 (2009): 1091-1107.

For present purposes, the second and third categories can be omitted as they form genres unto themselves. "Kehi kinnor" belongs to the fourth category while the wedding odes of Modena belong to the first, and those of Zacuto to the first and second. It is prob- ably because of its being unattached to specific individuals that it entered the prayer manuals - those by Modena and Zacuto, at any rate, did not. Archivolti's two other wedding odes are, by contrast, works that, like Modena's and Zacuto's, name their recipients. The first, "'Uri yehidati ve-'anpei tomer " (Awake, my soul,84 on branches of a palm tree), in terza rima (with nineteen tercets and a final quatrain), was written for Jacob ben Moses Todros and his bride Penina bat Joseph Levi;85 the second, " Im omar lakh gisi" (If I tell you, my brother-in-law), in seven lines (with four feet to a line, each foot composed of six longs), was written for Jacob - no further details are given - and his unnamed bride, who appears to have been Archivolti's sister.86 It is in their thematics that the three authors' poems reveal similarities. Nor does the difference in categories - poems for specific persons, poems for general usage - seem to have been of relevance in determining their content.87 Of the various "themes" cited above for "Kehi kinnor," two will be illustrated for their 82. For his sixteen generally long and intricate riddle epithalamia, see Essa et levavi, 135-225. There are none in Modena's Divan.

An exception to this type would be a short riddle appended to a regular wedding ode as a postscript: an example is "Eikh teshvu nirpim ve-lo tashiru" (How can you sit there idly without singing?) by the Mantuan rabbi and physician Luliano Shalom ben Samuel Cases (d. 1630); Bregman, ed., Zeror zehuvim: sonettim 'ivriyyim, 151-52. It rightly belongs to the first category. 83.

See Bernstein, "Shirim hadashim le-Rabbi Shemu'el Arkivolti," 59-61, though the author appears to have misread tomer as homer (matter) - I thank Dvora Bregman for the correction.

The coverage is not meant to be complete. Rather, I focus on certain representative examples. For "rejoicing," in its various noun and verb forms, one finds, in Modena's wedding odes, "... a prayer for the groom and the bride to make them rejoice [le-samham] in joy [gilah] and mirth [rinah]";ss "To the voice of the groom, to the voice of the bride, to the voice of joy [gilah] much happiness [simhah], / To a full voice in rejoicing [sason] and joy [g/7]";89 "On the day of the happiness [simhah] of your wedding the heart of friends will be glad [yagel] for you, / They will look at the splendor of your glory with much gaiety [hedvah]";90 "Happiness [simhah] for the house of Simhah for the glory of your name" (the groom's first name was Simcha);91 "Isaac [Yizhak] will laugh [yizhak ], he will rejoice [yismah], his heart will be glad [yagel ]" (the groom's first name was Isaac);92 "Thus every heart in Israel will be glad [yagel ], will rejoice [yismah], will thank God";93 and "I will say in a voice of joy [sason] and a voice of happiness [simhah]: let there be further rejoicings [semahot] in Israel."94 Zacuto writes in a similar vein: "Beloved ones, friends, be jubilant [zahalu]";95 "Joy [sason] and happiness [simhah], groom and bride, / Mirth [rinah] and rejoicing [gilah], revelry [dizah] and gaiety [hedvah]"96 (a restatement of the last of the Seven Blessings);97 ". . . on this day . . . every soul will rejoice [tasis] and be happy [&lt; tismah ]";98 "Honor to God will he give in a voice of rejoicing [sason] and joy [g//]";99 and "[The kingdom of] Judah will be glad [yagel], [the kingdom of] Ephraim will revel [ya a/oz]."100 Rejoicing, it might be noted, was underscored in one of Archivolti 's two other wedding odes. "On this day," the poet writes, "may the groom together with his adornment of great worthies from the community of the sons of Living God noisily approach together in happiness [sason]"101 The vocabulary (the groom's attendants, the congregation of a Living God) recalls "Kehi kinnor." Music, too, figured in the same ode in words that connect with "Kehi kinnor," or better throw light on its reading. By "Praises and a voice of song [zimrah] in exchange for sacrifice,"102 Archivolti implies that with the destruc- tion of the Temple, songs and praises (in the synagogue) substituted for sacrificial 88.

Hence the verses, in "Kehi kinnor," "And may the voices" be those of a people "thought to be sacrificing the splendor of fattened sheep to an awesome God" (1.2, 2.1) and "And you will hasten ... to offer a sacrifice and a proper burnt offering" (8.2) may be construed to refer to an offering made through song when, as predicted in the ode, the Temple is rebuilt and its ceremonial reinstated.103 Music, for Modena, was a natural way to rejoice in wedding festivities - he argued for it there in a response about the legitimacy of song in the synagogue.104 His wedding odes are rife with musical imagery, for example: ". . . on the parting of the Red Sea all broke into song [shir ah], including Moses";105 "Friends, lift a psaltery [, nevel ], a tambourine [tof | with a pleasant lyre [kinnor] for his [the groom's] happiness";106 "Now will those lift a voice of gladness and a song [shir] who pluck a tune [nigguri] on a psaltery [j nevel ]";107 or "Kithara [kidros] and the voice of a sambuca [sabkha], psaltery [psanterin ], tam- bourines [tupin] and lyres [kinnorin] and all [kinds of] song [z/mra]."108 Modena composed a particularly memorable ode for the wedding of David Portaleone, son of Abraham Portaleone, who, in his treatise on the ancient temple Shiltei ha-gibborim [Shields of Heroes], spoke of King David's lyre that, hanging over his bed, played of itself at midnight.109 The first five distichs of Modena's ode read thus: A lyre [kinnor] was hanging over the head of the king: it plays a song [zimrah] to honor God; 103. The one reference to music in the second of Archivolti's two other odes is the clang of drums that stir his thoughts to compose a worthy poem (". . . for my drums [tupai] will scream: why doze? / Thus I will polish my song [shiri], a clear path will I not abandon, I will hack the tongue of stutterers until revealing wisdom"); "Im omar lakh gisi," in Bernstein, "Shirim hadashim," 65-66 (lines 3-4). 104.

Shlomo Simonsohn (Jerusalem: Rabbi Kook Institute, 1955), 15-20 (the response originated in a controversy, in Ferrara, 1605, over the introduction of art music into the synagogue). See, e.g., the statement that "it is the custom of all Israel to offer praises in the houses of bridegrooms and at [wedding] banquets to the sound of neginot (songs) and to the sound of rejoicing" (ibid., 18). 105.

Modena appears to have been influenced by a similar passage in Archivolti's Mayan ganim (Venice: Alvise Bragadin, 1553), fol. 10a (". . . sambuca, psaltery, sumponya, and all varieties of song"; though here in a different context: the father warns his son not to pursue the frivolous pleasures of instrumental and vocal song). 109.

Modena was probably influenced by the even more impressive discussion of this passage that Judah Moscato placed as the cornerstone of sermon 1 in his Sefer nefuzot Yehudah (for details, see above, note 49). 274</page><page sequence="23">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti At night a North Wind blows on it: it would play well without being touched; I too am a lyre [kinnor] and hollow wood: at your feet, bridegroom David, will I present A segment of song [shirah] even though I do not have strength or even knowledge to sing [la-shir]; there will come, Though, a wind from the North to make the splendor and strength of your glory move their strings [metreihem].110 [eight distichs follow] Zacuto followed suit with a similar wedding ode dedicated to David ben Abraham Ferrara and his bride Leah bat Immanuel Vallensi.111 Its first stanza reads: If the voice of the lyre [kinnor] of David over his bed Played by itself at midnight, How much more does the voice of the name of a man who lives in his virtue When his name is revealed in its glory to every eye!

First, it is a wedding ode that, to all appearances, won such popularity as to be printed and reprinted in earlier and later prayer manuals. In this it holds its own against Modena's and Zacuto's wedding odes, which, because of their speci- ficity in being composed for particular weddings, were excluded from them. Who the addressee was in "Kehi kinnor" is uncertain. It could have been a specific bride and groom, or brides and grooms in general, or, on a metaphoric level, the congregation rejoicing in their nuptials or its members as an emblem for Jews at large. Second, it contains melodies that, because of their common substructural pitches, raise the possibility of a connection with one or more unknown tunes to which the text was sung in Archivolti's time. Serious questions of methodology come to the fore. To what extent does a prototypical melody, such as the one plotted above, testify to historical longevity? To what extent does it apply if not in fact, at least in theory to the determination of earlier melodies? Distance between communities and not their ritual affiliation seems to have engendered the differences between the three melodies recorded in the 1950s, but can one premise the same for melodies sung to one or another text in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? A third reason is its content. The poet suggests that those who rejoice in the bride and groom rejoice in God and Torah: voices of gladness, among them the voice of God, correlate with the voices that preceded the revelation of his laws (1.1-2.1 and comment to 1 . 1 ). Marriage as the union of bride and groom is an alle- gory for the union of God with his people. The union is premised on the centrality of Torah as a behavioral and ethical guide. The supreme legislator is a "Living God" (R.l), "living" because, by "keeping His commandments and His statutes and His judgments" as prescribed in Torah, his people "will live and multiply" (Deuteronomy 30:16). "Choose life," for "He is your life" (30:19-20). The "Living God" is "the spirit of life," 119. "Avo be-shir yihud," ibid., 65-66 (lines 1-2). 120. "Miftah sefat ha-shir," ibid., 115-16 (line 1). 121. "Evrat shirah nazo teze," ibid., 61-64 (lines 1-4). "Melody of melodies" alludes to the Song of Songs; "Awake, awake," to Psalms 57:9 ("Awake, my soul, awake, psaltery [ nevel) and lyre [kinnor]"); and "To the chief musician on Shushan 'eduf (in reference, it would seem, to the opening words of a particular melody), to Psalms 60:1. Shoshan above is probably a musical instru- ment, as in Psalms 45:1 ("To the chief musician on shoshannim "). 276</page><page sequence="25">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti his words are "on our tongue," as said in the refrain to another wedding ode close to "Kehi kinnor" in the printed sources:122 Be-shem El Hai hegyon leshonenu In the name of Living God is the utterance on our tongue Be- 'od ruah hayyim be-apeinu While the spirit of life is in our nostrils. Be-shem El Hai In the name of Living God We are told, in the continuation, that he hearkens to our pleas, responding from the heights ("On earth we will call and You will answer us / And the mountains answer before us: / In the name of Living God')123 and that, as our Creator, he undertakes our protection and at the end of time will see to our revival: Source of life: You revived us And called us to call Your name; Yes, in the semblance of man you created us, And if the sin of man will kill us, You will return and revive us: In the name of Living God}24 The "hidden" connections, in Archivolti 's "Kehi kinnor," between marriage, Torah, and renewal emerge with full clarity in a passage from Zohar.125 Like the last of the Seven Blessings, it cites voices of merriment after Jeremiah, then draws them into the domain of the Song of Songs, only to form its own conclusions. The passage reads thus: The Holy One, blessed be He, will make a [wedding] canopy in Jerusalem for every righteous man. It is written: . . the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride" [Jeremiah 16:9] when the Shekhinah returns to the King and He becomes engaged to her, as it is written: "Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold ... on the day of His wedding, and on the day of the gladness of His heart" [Song of Songs 2:11]. "The day of His wedding" is the giving of Torah, and "the day of the gladness of His heart" is the building of the Temple, may it be built soon in our days.126 122.

Zohar, 1, Genesis, Parashat "Va-yehi," fol. 215a. 277</page><page sequence="26">Don Harran We learn, as the conceptual backdrop for Archivolti's verses, that the wedding of bride and groom is the wedding of the Shekhinah and the King, namely, God as manifest in one of his attributes ( Tif'eret ). The King is the King of Glory, who, as predicted in Psalms 24:9, will "enter" when the gates of heaven are lifted (see epigraph). On the day of his wedding one hears joyful voices. It was the day on which Torah was given and the day on which the Temple was built (see comments to 1.1 and 2.1). But these are images projected into a future messianic era, to be introduced when the Temple is reconstructed (see comment to 2.2): Torah and Temple are to be understood in a universal sense. It could be that Archi- volti said something to this effect in the missing comments to the concluding verses in the autograph copy. Reference was already made to Archivolti's second wedding ode (" 'Uri yehidati ve-'anpei tomer"). It may hold the key to these same missing comments. Its verses mark the coming of the Messiah as a return to origins, a paradisiac situ- ation with no blight of sin, no suffering from exile. As in the berit shalom assured by the wedding contract in "Kehi kinnor" (5.1), so here the covenant of peace that God signed with his people will guarantee their security forever after. But unlike the Garden of Eden that gave humans life but denied them wisdom, the new era will provide them with both. The concluding stanza reads: Toward our Messiah they will speedily rejoice And the covenant of peace will be known to all; In cleaving to each other [bi-devukam] they will hint At the combination of the Tree of Life with the Tree of Wisdom.127 The true meaning of "cleaving to each other" in the next-to-last line above is revealed, as is perhaps another "hidden message" in "Kehi kinnor," in a further passage from Zohar. It speaks of "the Holy Ancient One [ 'Atika Kadisha ], the hidden of hiddens, separate and divided from everything, yet not separate, since everything cleaves [mitdabbek] to Him and He cleaves to everything; He is every- thing."128 Ineffable happiness lies in the "wedding" of humans both with one another, as a man who "cleaves" to his wife,129 and with "the Holy Ancient One," as God's creatures who "cleave" to their Maker.130 Bound by his covenant, he, in turn, "cleaves" to them for their own protection.131 Don Harran The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jerusalem, Israel 127.

After Isaiah 23: 1 6 (along with harbi shir , next verse, and, vaguely, sovev, distich 4, in allu- sion to sobbi 'ir, "circle about the city"): the proof text has nothing to do with rejoicing; rather, its content is antithetical (see above). For "tak[ing] the lyre" both Isaiah and Archivolti rely on 1 Samuel 16:23 (where David "took his lyre" to relieve Saul of his melancholy). 135. Hebrew transcript after Siddur mi-berakhah, 1618, which, for reasons of scansion, writes zahalah (as it appears in Davar be- 'itto, 1 653; Siddur mi-berakhah, 1 623, 1716; Amsterdam, Gans, MS D 68) as zahlah. 136. After Isaiah 23:16 (see above). 137.

For "me'od na'alah," see Psalms 47:10. 138. The groom's and bride's voices are two of five voices for rejoicing: see Jeremiah 33:1 1, as above, also 7:34 ('in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem I stopped the voice of mirth and the voice of happiness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, for the land will become des- olate") and, similarly, 16:9, 25:10. 1 39. Isaiah 62:5 ("the rejoicing of the groom over the bride"). As said, the groom's is one of the five voices for rejoicing (see above). 140. Read: for the rejoicing of his attendants (at the wedding). The Hebrew vocalization is after Davar be- 'itto, 1653, and Siddur mi-berakhah , 1618, in both, moreover, as le-shoshevinav (, Siddur mi-berakhah, 1716: le-shushevinav ), or five syllables, which, for reasons of scansion, have been reduced (in the reading above) to four. 280</page><page sequence="29">"Kehi kinnor," a Wedding Ode by Samuel Archivolti Comment to 1.1 irKi inn nnyoa mmn in^n pm n^N] TN mnm [Nftp pian] p"Dn nfrip rH3 namw mm1? hdit in&amp;wÂ» dni hdi mVip 'ra -nw Be-ferek kamma di-Verakhot amar Rabbi Helbo kol ha-neheneh mi-se 'udat hatan ve-eino mesamho ' over be-hamishah kolot ve-khulei ve-im mesamho zokheh le-Torah she-nitnah be-hamishah kolot In the first chapter of Berakhot [one reads]:141 "Rabbi Helbo said . . . :142 'Anyone who enjoys the banquet of the groom and does not rejoice with him does violence to the five voices,' " and so forth,143 " 'and if he does rejoice with him . . . ,144 he acquires [the knowledge of] Torah which was given with five voices.'

Gendered as a feminine dative object, "it" appears to refer to Jerusalem, hitherto not men- tioned, yet implied by the continuation ("for ruin"). On building for the Lord, see Ezra 4: 1 (". . . they build a sanctuary for the Lord, God of Israel"); and on the reconstruction of Jerusalem, Nehemiah 2:17, 12:27 and 43. 153. The First Temple was destroyed in 586 BCE, the Second Temple in 70 CE. Le-mappelah (i into ruin) might seem to be an error in the sources for mi-mappelah {from ruin), thus Jerusalem "rebuilt" (after the fall of the First Temple). Yet le-mappelah is supported by Isaiah 25:2 ("For You turned a city into a heap, a fortified domain into ruin [le-mappelah]"). 154. Berakhot 6b (same paragraph as above, continuation), followed by the words: "for it is said [after Jeremiah 33:1 1]: 'For I will return the captivity of the land to be as it was at first,' said the Lord." 155. The sources cite various portions of the refrain after the four stanzas. Some have its first four words (Kehi kinnor ' se'i gilah), as, e.g., Davar be-'itto, 1653, and Siddur mi-berakhah, 1618, while others have its first two (Kehi kinnor ), as, e.g., Siddur mi-berakhah, 1716. 1 56. From the locution "El barukh gedol de ' ah " (Blessed God, great in knowledge) in a prayer for the weekday morning service. In the present verse, gedol de 'ah is anthropomorphized, in the con- tinuation, as ish tohen ("a man ... a miller"), in reference, it would seem, to the rabbi who presides over the wedding (see section on "Semantics"). 157.

B. Ketubbot 16b-17a, from chap. 2 (on "the woman who became a widow"). Rashi reads "How do they dance before her?" as "What do they say before her?" (in her praise). The continuation is: "Beit Shammai [the followers of Shammai] say: 'The bride as she is' [meaning one should not exag- gerate in praising a bride] and Beit Hillel [the followers of Hillel] say: 'Lovely and graceful bride' [meaning every bride has to be regarded as lovely and graceful]. Beit Shammai said to Beth Hillel: 'If she were lame or blind, would one say of her: Lovely and graceful bride? for the Torah said, Keep away from a false statement [Exodus 33:7].'" 160. Archivolti originally wrote ve-shikhlulah (and her beauty), then crossed it out, replacing it with ve-hen hen lah (after Zechariah 4:7); see fig. 2. 1 thank Shlomo Zucker for deciphering the original. There are differences in the sources, for example: Siddur mi-berakhah , 1618, has ve-hen hen lah while Davar be-'itto , 1653, has the same though spells ve-hen as ve-hein. 161. The translation follows the order of the Hebrew, though clearly, for an idiomatic reading, "May he examine" should precede "the glow of her loveliness." Siddur mi-berakhah , 1623, 1716, has bohen (an inferior reading). 162. Davar be-'itto , 1653, and Siddur mi-berakhah , 1623, 1716, have sherak, yet the word should begin not with sh but with s (as corrected above). 163. Ve-ya "lat, so vocalized (for sake of scansion), after Davar be-'itto , 1653, and Siddur mi-berakhah , 1618, though it should properly be ve-ya 'alat (as in Siddur mi-berakhah, 1623, 1716). The graceful woman is the bride, yet also Torah, both to be praised for their "splendor," beauty, and "majesty." For wording, see B. Ketubbot 17a: "/o kahal ve-lo sarak ve-lo pirkus ve-ya 'alat hen which Rashi explains as follows: "/o kahal , she does not need powder; ve-lo sarak , [nor does she need] color to redden her face; pirkus , [nor does she need any] waving of her hair . . . indeed, she is a graceful gazelle." The passage connects with the controversy between Hillel and Shammai over how one praises the bride (see above): Archivolti appears to side with Shammai, whose point was, beyond the admonition that one should not exaggerate in lauding the bride, that the bride is beautiful for her person, not for her cosmetics or hairdo. 164. Same passage (Ketubbot 17a). "West" refers to the land of Israel. The continuation is as at the end of 4.1 ( ve-ya 'alat hen). 283</page><page sequence="32">Don Harran 4.2 irfrxatini â¢ / rfrsn 7in3 â  n1?^ *?KI fÂ£-e/ mulah ' kevod ba'alah / u-vi-y'tninah ' u-vi-s'molah And across from her is her honored husband,165 / while to her right " and her left Comment to 4.2 rt?yÂ±&gt; mzrw nraw hn] e&gt;"j/k [pis] 'd ruran Be-mishnat perek af- 'al-pi mal'akhot she-ishah 'osah le-va 'alah [See], in Mishnat [Torah], the chapter about the restrictions on things a woman does to [attract] her husband.166 Refrain (Distich 1) nVa w nÂ» Tip Stanza 3 (Distichs 6-7) 5.1 ' DW rpia / â¢ ann ^ Shenei dodim ' mekhubbadim / berit shalom ' be-mishkanam Two beloved ones of eminence / have a contract of peace in their dwelling.167 Comment to 5.1 f?nN nt&gt;v â¢o rum iein mron isâ¢ mr rrroan in^rr Nnn [pisn] 'Dn nrwnm oti â o wm itpin nnrn [pism] 'Dm Be-ferek ha-ba 'al yevimto ha-mekhabbedah yoter mi-gufo ' alav ha-katuv omer va-yadata ki shalom oholekha u-ve-ferek ha-zahav okiru neshaikhu ki heikhi de-tit'atteru In the chapter "If a man cohabited with his deceased brother's wife" [i.e., the childless widow of his brother]168 [one reads]: . .169 who honors 165.

And thus did Raba say to the townspeople of Mahuza [a large commercial town on the Tigris, where Raba had an academy]: 'Honor your wives so that you may be enriched' B. Baba Mezi'a 59a. 174. "Sons" refers not only to the children of the married couple but to future generations of those who practice Torah. On the blessings of fruitfulness, see, e.g., Genesis 1:28, 9:1, 22:17. 175.

See, for the first, Psalms 77:5 ("I am so troubled that I cannot speak"), Genesis 41:8 ("And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled"), Daniel 2:3 ("[I have dreamed a dream] and my spirit was troubled to know the dream"); and for the second, namely, the protection that God promised his people in his covenant with them, Psalms 18:27, 34:7, 44:7, 106:10, 107:13, 19, though the theme is ubiquitous in Scriptures at large. 182. God pledged to renew the Temple after restoring the Jews from their captivity, Jeremiah 33:11. 183. Literally "her," which, as before (distich 3), appears to designate Jerusalem. The construc- tion is awkward - for one, the verb "hasten" lacks an object; for another, the dative lah is one of refer- ence, hence (as translated) "hasten unto it."
