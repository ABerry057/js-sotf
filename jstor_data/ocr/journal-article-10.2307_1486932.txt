<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yael Zerubavel. Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. xx, 340 pp. In a contemporary intellectual culture driven by paradox, it ought to come as no great surprise that remembering is a hot topic. Equally present in the current academic fascination with memory is an axiom of longer-standing pedigree: that Jews have more of it, that they do their remembering longer, harder, better, with greater obsessiveness. Erstwhile deconstructionists, im- pelled by some high-profile genealogical traumas of their own, have converted their linguistically inclined version of poststructuralism into something called trauma theory, in which the struggles of Holocaust survivors to remember their unbearable--and hence largely irrecoverable--experiences stand at once as the outcome of the particular horrors of the Nazi era and as sign of the necessary dividedness of modem subjectivity. The emergence of this poststructuralist interest in the workings of individual memory has been roughly coincident with the appearance of a different interest in a different sort of memory, associated in the academic realm with the growing, though loosely defined, field of cultural studies. Confining itself neither to the literary nor the linguistic, this second kind of study tends to focus on the "memory" of collectivities rather than individuals, and to examine the ways in which various social, cultural, and political institutions, practices, and interests interact with one another to produce a sense of shared memory out of the raw stuff of mere happening. It is with this latter, culturalist methodology that Yael Zerubavel's com- pelling new study, Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition ought to be aligned. Zerubavel shows the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 325 way in which a complex variety of acts of "commemoration"--practices ranging from state-sponsored memorial ceremonies, educational curricula, and television broadcasts to epic poems and ritual youth-group excursions and to popular jokes and songs-function to produce, and at times to challenge, what she calls "the master commemorative narrative of Israeli society" (p. 12). This master narrative is notable, Zerubavel tells us, for the extent to which it "focus[es] on events that did not occupy a major place in traditional Jewish memory." The early Zionists, she explains, sought to create a political-national collective memory that at once repudiated and drew upon the authority and practices of an already existing religious Jewish memory, and for this reason the Israeli example illustrates with particular clarity the selectivity of collective memory, the way in which it "continually negotiates between available historical records and the current social and political agendas" (p. 5). While theorists of collective memory like Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora conceive of collective memory and historical knowledge as different historical stages within a developmental continuum, with staid "disciplined" history supplanting a looser notion of group memory as a given society moves toward modernity, for Zerubavel collective memory is dynamic, occurring alongside and in shifting relation to the available historical record. The content of collective memory is thus always at least partly constrained by the available historical record, even as it draws upon the cultural authority granted historicity. But Israeli collective memory does not simply suppress certain historical events in order to emphasize others; it is selective within discernible patterns. How is it that "historical events that had ended in death and defeat could be transformed in Israeli culture into heroic symbols" (p. xiv)? Recovered Roots traces the symbolic evolution of three events--the fall of Masada (73 C.E.), the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 C.E.), and the defense of Tel Hai (1920)--as they are repeatedly written and rewritten from the earliest years of the Yishuv through the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel to the major disruptions of the cultural symbolic brought about in the 1980s by the Lebanon War and the Intifada. The first section of the book examines "how a historic battle in which several settlers die and the survivors evacuate the settlement can become a myth of successful defense and a symbol of 'no retreat' (Tel Hai); how the leader of a revolt that ends with defeat is remembered as a legendary hero who led the people to freedom (Bar Kokhba); and how a historical episode that ends with a collective suicide is transformed into a myth of fighting to the bitter end" (p. xviii).</page><page sequence="3">326 BOOK REVIEWS Zerubavel's genealogy is formidably interdisciplinary, not only encom- passing a range of artifacts from the aesthetic to the overtly pedagogic, from the ephemeral to the canonical, but including as well extensive interviews with those Israelis who are the objects of some of the culture's most con- certed efforts at national subject formation-adolescent students drawn from both religious and secular school populations. But interdisciplinarity does more than simply make the case for the pervasiveness of certain cultural myths of relatively recent vintage; in Zerubavel's account, it is precisely the marshaling of such an extensive variety of cultural practices under the rubric of "commemoration" that produces the symbolic transformations in which she is interested. Indeed, much of the intellectual history is familiar: we are told, for example, that the early Zionists sought to connect the centrality of state autonomy in Palestine to the notion of Jewish national identity by emphasizing the division of the Jewish past into two periods, antiquity and exile, to the exclusion of alternative models of categorization, such as classification according to generations of rabbinical scholars, or the division of Diaspora communities according to their geographical location. But the power of her argument, not merely its methodology, lies in its details. Thus not only do we learn that the nationalizing secularization of the Jewish past associated with the antiquity/exile taxonomy was accomplished in part by relabeling the conventional division "First and Second Temple" with the modern Hebrew ha-bayit ha-rishon, ha-bayit ha-sheni ("First and Second House" or "Commonwealth"), but we are offered detailed readings of the ways in which Zionist educators and politicians employed the pointedly religious semiotic system of the holiday cycle as a means of erasing the significance of religiosity in the Jewish past. "Holidays create commemorative narratives about specific events, detaching them from their broad historical context" (p. 216). So the Bar Kokhba Revolt is transformed from a military defeat under the command of a leader of dubious ethical credentials (Bar Kokhba was known in a number of early and medieval rabbinical sources as Bar Koziba, from the Hebrew word kazav, "lie" [p. 50]), into an example of the ancient Hebrews' willingness to take up arms to preserve their freedom. This is done in part by relocating its commemoration on the Jewish calendar. Traditionally, the final battle of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the fall of Betar, had been commemorated on Tisha B'av, the fast day that also marked the destruction of the First and Second Temples. By transferring the commemoration of the revolt from Tisha B'av to the minor festival of Lag B'omer, around which time the revolt began, the Zionist collective memory shifted the commemoration from the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 327 outcome of the revolt to Bar Kokhba's victory over the Romans during its initial stages, transforming the event "from a cause for collective mourning to a cause for collective celebration" (p. 55). Moreover, because the Lag B'omer holiday falls during the school year, while Tisha B'av occurs during the summer break, the new "happy" version of the Bar Kokhba revolt was able to be institutionalized within, and by means of, the school curriculum in the form of lessons, songs, staged performances, and bonfires, while the more morose linkage of the revolt to Tisha B'av became easy to ignore. But in Zerubavel's account, state recognition and the various forms of institutionalization that follow from such recognition ought not automati- cally to be understood as a kind of unambiguous hegemonic triumph. In the final section of Recovered Roots, Zerubavel tracks the emergence of "countermemories," discourses and rituals that challenge, either openly or obliquely, the narratives of Zionism's "master collective memory." Here, we learn that the addition of Tel Hai Day to the holiday calendar generated not only annual pilgrimages to the "Roaring Lion" Tel Hai memorial in the Upper Galilee, but, in the 1930s and 1940s, a fierce battle between Socialist and Revisionist Zionists over the true lesson of the Tel Hai massacre and its implications for contemporary policy (pp. 148-157), and more recently, a veritable cottage industry in jokes and cartoons lampooning Tel Hai's heretofore heroic one-armed commander Yosef Trumpeldor. Similarly, the Israeli state's assumption of symbolic and administrative control over the Masada site-a control articulated most deliberately by the formal state burial given to the archaeological remains of Masada's last defenders, the establishment of Masada as the oath-taking site for the Armored Corps, and the construction of a cable-car ride to the summit to replace the ancient "snake path" (pp. 129-137)--effectively disrupted the site's function as locus of Zionist memory. The official and legal character of the oath-of-allegiance ceremonies transforms a tradition [of strenuously hiking the path to the Masada summit] that was spontaneous and voluntary into a formal contract between the citizen-soldier and the state. By assuming the role of mediator, the state inevitably [emphasis added] introduced a cognitive distance between contemporary Israelis and their ancient predecessors in an act that was originally conceived as a form of direct bonding between them. (p. 131) So at the very moment the Zionist project seems to be realized most</page><page sequence="5">328 BOOK REVIEWS fully, the moment when Jews are not only able to assert control over the summit of Masada but do so with the assurance that their assertions are backed up by the institutional authority of an internationally recognized nation-state, the "inevitable" result is the alienation of fully formed Israeli national subjects from the ideology that has produced them. But what exactly makes such an outcome inevitable? I want to suggest that the inevitability that asserts its authority to describe the condition of Israeli collective memory-it can happen no other way--has less to do with any particular quality of that memory or its modes of institutionalization than with the self-imposed constraints of Zerubavel's analysis. In its insistence upon the necessity of the movement from idea to outcome, the rhetoric of inevitability points to what is missing from the analysis in Recovered Roots of Israeli commemorative culture: an account of the relations between the realm of symbolic politics whose complex movements and countermovements it so compellingly details and the nondiscursive relations of institutional power within which this space of symbolic politics is framed-and made to matter. Remarkably, we are never told what would make a given opinion or ideology "count" as part of "the master commemorative narrative." Is a joke told in a living room among close friends as much a part of Israeli collective memory as a holiday taught and celebrated in the schools? How about a joke told to an interviewer? What if variants of the joke are repeated by 80 or 90 percent of the people interviewed? Zerubavel assumes, quite rightly, that ideology cannot occur without representation; she goes on to conclude from this, less convincingly, to my mind, that there is no difference between how people talk about or represent institutions and how those institutions operate. Thus, when she tells us that the jokes that Israelis have recently come to tell about Tel Hai "both reveal and suppress ambivalence about the way and the legacy of patriotic sacrifice, thereby diffusing the impact of [their] political message" (p. 171), the "ambivalence" expressed and the "diffusion" of its impact are not measured as relations to the actual operation of political institutions, but, rather, are conceived as relations to-specifically, as a deviation from-the ways in which the Tel Hai massacre has been represented, and celebrated and symbol- ized, in the past. In other words, for Zerubavel, the "humorous framework" of jokes does not diffuse the political impact of Tel Hai because it produces no changes in how the Israeli military is organized internally or conceived in the calculation of foreign or domestic political strategy-indeed, from the descriptions we are given, we have no way of evaluating whether there has</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 329 been any impact at all--but, rather, jokes diffuse their political impact insofar as they do not clearly express an attitude toward the past representations and ritualizations of Tel Hai. The interdisciplinarity of Recovered Roots, while admirably cataloging a wide variety of voices, inadvertently allows the differences among voices to take the place of the difference between saying something and having it matter. The analysis presented in Recovered Roots is not wholly insensible to this difference. In her final account of the politics of the memorialization of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Zerubavel recalls a controversy surrounding a series of newspaper articles written in the early 1980s, in which Yehoshafat Harkabi, a professor of international relations at Hebrew University, not only characterized the Bar Kokhba revolt as one of the three major disasters in Jewish history, but argued that the same spirit that led to the disastrous revolt, an admiration of "rebelliousness and heroism, detached from responsibility for their consequences" (Harkabi, quoted on p. 180), also characterized much of current Israeli political culture. Harkabi admits to having been stunned by the uproar that ensued from these articles, not because he had expected his sharp criticisms of contemporary policy to be greeted without a stir, but because the vehement response the articles unleashed so greatly exceeded that which had been provoked by earlier articles he had written registering similar criticisms of Israeli-Arab relations without invoking Bar Kokhba as an historical analogue. What this response suggests is that there is a politics to the act of symbolization itself as well as to particular symbols or narratives. The existence of this politics of symbolization suggests that the social effects of any particular act of symbolic politics, such as the government's decision to have soldiers swear allegiance on the summit of Masada, would not be "inevitable." In the opening pages of Recovered Roots, Zerubavel announces that she "is particularly interested in finding out how historical events that had ended in death and defeat could be transformed in Israeli culture into heroic symbols" (p. xiv). Zerubavel does a remarkable job of demonstrating that such a transformation took place, as well as showing how it was brought about. Why it happened is a question she leaves largely unexamined. That the Zionists were able to emphasize certain events at the expense of others and thus emerge with a new collective memory seems, by the end of Recovered Roots, beyond argument; why they selected stories of military defeat as the particular narratives to be reworked is a question still to be taken up. Zerubavel's most provocative discovery seems to me one of which she is largely unaware: the</page><page sequence="7">330 BOOK REVIEWS existence of a deep strain of ambivalence toward the institutional power of the state, and toward its power to define national culture, within even the most apparently "nationalist" Zionist practices. The uncovering of this ambivalence is a significant historical discovery, one whose potential political effects are undeniable (though not inevitable). It is an ambivalence that deserves to be explored, not simply enacted. Irene Tucker Duke University Durham, N.C.</page></plain_text>
