New Haven and Lon- don: Yale University Press, 2001. viii, 343 pp. This volume is an ambitious and wide-ranging (perhaps too wide-ranging) study of the interrelationship between medicine and German-speaking Jews throughout the ages. In essence it deals with two separate but intertwined issues: German-speaking Jews in the medical profession and the use of medical discourse to analyze and evaluate the Jewish people. The book covers a wide area both chronologically and geographically. "German Jews" is interpreted very broadly and includes a number of East European figures who either wrote in German or were trained in German universities. Although the bulk of the volume (Chaps. 4- 7) deals with the period from around 1870 to the beginning of World War I, the first three chapters "begin at the beginning" (the Middle Ages) and carry the sto- ry up to the late eighteenth century. This book is a broadening of Efron's earlier work, Defenders of the Race: Jewish Doctors and Race Science in Fin-de-Siecle Europe, widening the chrono- logical frame and narrowing the geographic area while expanding beyond the racial aspects of the scientific and medical analysis of the Jews. Efron's analysis is heavily influenced by the currently popular school of study of the body often associated with the name of Sander Gilman. Efron claims, with considerable justification, that his findings shed light on broader aspects of Central European culture, especially the nature of modern Jewish identity and of modern anti-Semi- tism. Medicine and the German Jews is based on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources in English, Hebrew, German, and Yiddish. Efron generally handles his sources well, though occasionally he misses the nuances of some of the German and Yiddish original sources he quotes. The book is marked by nu- merous fascinating digressions into the general history of the medical profession or wider aspects of Jewish culture (e.g., a discussion of the feldshers [medical healers without formal medical school training] or Jewish diet and its relation- ship to health). To my mind, the sections of the book that deal with the role of medicine in constructing the image of modern European Jews are stronger than the sections of the history of Jews in the medical profession. The first chapter, on the emergence of the medieval Jewish physician, seems overly general and covers a vast topic too sketchily. In the second chapter, the lengthy section on the early modern polemic against Jewish doctors (45-57) was particularly interesting. It seems to justify Efron's claim that sixteenth-century Germany "developed a vocabulary and a can- onized set of beliefs about the Jewish physician that remained a permanent fixture of German anti-Semitism into the modern period" (46). The third chapter, on "Haskalah and Healing," concentrates on a close analysis of the writing of three Jewish physicians of the eighteenth century: Elcan Wolf, Moshe Markuze, and Markus Herz. I found Efron's analysis of Herz's attack on the Jewish tradition of early burial in the context of late eighteenth-century fears about burial alive par- ticularity illuminating. Despite the interesting content in Markuze's work, I won- 390</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews dered about the inclusion of his work written in Yiddish by an East European doc- tor (even if trained in Prussia). If, as Efron claims, the Haskalah doctors set an agenda for later Jewish criticisms of tradition, one wonders why he skips to the late nineteenth century with virtually no chronological bridge between his three Has- kalah doctors and the nineteenth-century fin de siecle. The heart of the book is in Chapters 4 to 6: "The Jewish Body Degenerate?," "The Psychopathology of Everyday Jewish Life," and "In Praise of Jewish Ritu- al." The clever titles give only an approximate idea of the contents of each chap- ter. Chapter 4 deals at length with the contradiction between medical statistics, which showed Jews to be healthier than the rest of the population, and the wide- spread image of "an enduring Jewish type-the sickly Jew." After detailed dis- cussion about the lower instance of alcoholism and tuberculosis among Jews, their lower infant mortality rate and longer life expectancy, Efron gives a fascinating gender-based analysis. The image of the male Jew was "feminized," depicting him as lacking the "manly" vice of alcoholism but instead, like women, having a hys- terical concern about his own health. Jews as urban, rootless, and homeless did not fit into the image of national greatness based on a healthy peasantry or knightly warriors construed by fin de sidcle European nationalism. Chapter 5 analyzes the image of Jews as neurotic, hysterical, and disproportionately prone to mental illness. The sixth chapter deals with medical and scientific debates about Jewish rituals such as kashruth, ritual slaughter, and circumcision. Again he shows the contrast between the generally positive opinions or medical experts and the overwhelmingly negative image pro- pounded by anti-Semitic publicists. The seventh chapter, dealing with Jews in the fin de siecle medical profession, returns to the earlier theme of polemical attacks on Jewish physicians and connects them with the huge increase in the numbers of Jewish doctors in the period. Not only are the sections of the book dealing with Jews in the medical pro- fession less original than the sections on medical views of the Jews, but they also include more errors. Although the errors do not generally invalidate the general argument of these parts of the study, they do show a lack of care in dealing with statistics. In one example, Efron misreads a statistic that 59 percent of Jewish university students studied medicine as if it showed that 59 percent of medical stu- dents were Jews. There are also occasional chronological or geographical mis- statements such as Efron's reference to the "emancipation discussion" in 1743, almost forty years before the discussion began. Despite such errors, the book is full of fascinating facts and insights. It helps us understand anti-Jewish hostility in a new way and adds significantly to our understanding of the ways in which the modern image of Jews has been constructed. Steven M.
