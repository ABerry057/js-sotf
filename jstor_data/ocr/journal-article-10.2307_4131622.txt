<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth Stow. Theater ofAcculturation: The Roman Ghetto in the Sixteenth Cen- tury. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2001. x, 246 pp. "Roman Jewry in the mid-sixteenth century," notes Kenneth Stow in the in- troduction to this stimulating volume, "offers an excellent venue for seeking to an- swer the theoretical question of how a distinct and distinctive minority created the cultural tools to cope with a difficult, ambivalent, and sometimes hostile environ- ment" (p. 5). Stow's reference to "cultural tools" reflects the implicit "Cultural Studies" orientation of his book, an orientation already indicated in the book's ti- tle as well as in its opening sentence, which declares that "this study is about strate- gies of cultural survival." Yet unlike many other works of a similar orientation, Stow's is based on years of archival research, primarily among the notarial records of the Roman Jewish community. Some two thousand documents from these records have been ably registered and summarized by Stow in the two volumes of his The Jews in Rome (Leiden, 1995-1997) to which the current volume (based on the Kennedy lectures delivered at Smith College in 1996), serves as an attrac- tive companion. Stow's reference to the Roman Ghetto as a "theater" in his title may remind some readers of Clifford Geertz's now classic Negara: The Theatre State in Nine- teenth-Century Bali (Princeton, 1980), a work which does indeed appear in his (quite extensive) bibliography. But Stow's theater is one of "social drama" 340</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews (p. 32ff), especially in cases of litigation (of which his notarial sources contain 860 cases), whereas Geertz sought to present Bali's state ceremonies as "metaphysical theater-theater, designed to express a view of the ultimate nature of reality and, at the same time, to shape the existing conditions of life to be consonant with that reality" (p. 104). This sort of theatricality was more characteristic of the papal court than the Roman Ghetto, and Stow, in fact, takes a special interest in the "sub- culture created by Roman Jews," which, he claims, challenged the dominant cul- ture of Rome "as much as it was imitating it" (p. 96). It must be admitted, however, that he presents considerably more evidence of imitation than of challenge. Thus, we are told (somewhat breezily) that Rome's three to four thousand Jews "looked andfor the mostpart talked, dressed, and lived like any other Romans" (p. 45), and (on the very same page) that Jews and Chris- tians often met in taverns "where they drank, gambled, and sometimes ate togeth- er" (emphases added). Stow's ostensibly cautious hedging in the latter part of both statements only underlines the bold implications of their opening words-that Ro- man Jews always looked like other Romans, and that they always (or, at least usu- ally) drank and gambled with Christians in the city's taverns. Indeed, already in his introduction Stow stresses "how Jews and Christians were always much alike but never truly the same" (p. 8). On this point he seems, in contrast to such scholars as Ariel Toaff (who has stressed sameness) and Robert Bonfil (who has stressed difference), to want to have his pizza and eat it too. Although Stow is greatly interested in the "subculture" created by Roman Jews, he does not describe it great detail. We are told that they had "their own spe- cial concept of space," focussing on the spatial sanctity of the ghetto (a subject Stow has treated before), but when it comes to such matters of everyday life as time and sound he hedges again. Although Jews and Christians had their respective hol- idays and days of rest, Stow insists that Roman Jews "were not tied exclusively to the Jewish calendar" and that they lived "comfortably within the two systems of time" (p. 51). He also sees them as having been no less "comfortable" with Chris- tian music, "especially Catholic sacred chant, which consciously or unconscious- ly they adopted" (p. 51). How then did Jewish sounds constitute part of a separate Jewish subculture? For Stow, the main difference seems to have been the sound- ing of the shofar on the New Year! "Subcultures," according to J. E Short in his eponymous entry in The Social Science Encyclopedia (1996), "denote shared systems of norms, values, interests, or behaviors" that distinguish individuals or groups from the larger societies in which they also participate. Furthermore, he notes that research has found "social separation" to be a major contributor to the formation of subcultures, tending to produce "cultural differentiation." In the context of sixteenth-century Italian his- tory, this would suggest that the social separation imposed by the ghettos (Rome's was established in 1555) would tend to promote a greater degree of cultural differ- entiation. Yet Stow repeatedly insists that "no matter how much the Ghetto physi- cally separated the Jews from Christians, psychologically the Jews never perceived it as hermetically sealing off the outside" (p. 93). Rather, with their enclosure of Roman Jews in their ghetto, "the stage was set," in his view, "for a drama in which Jews could blur, or sometimes even ignore, the differences between them and their 341</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews non-Jewish neighbors, yet recognize that as Jews ... they must punctiliously fos- ter their own, Jewish ways" (pp. 93-94). Although Roman (and other Italian) Jews certainly fostered their own ways, they did not always do so punctiliously. Stow himself stresses the degree to which they were notoriously lax about the prohibition of imbibing non-Jewish wine (pp. 45-46). In this matter and related ones they may, in fact, perhaps be seen as constituting a subculture within the Jewish world-neither Askenazic nor Sephardic. Stow's stimulating and well-written book, together with the two previ- ously published volumes of documents, will provide scholars with useful tools for examining both the relationship of Roman Jewry to its Catholic environment and the degree to which the Roman experience was different from that of communities to the north in Tuscany, Lombardy, and the Veneto.
