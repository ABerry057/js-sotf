<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Vital. The Future of the Jews. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990. ix, 161 pp. The nature of the prediction promised by the title David Vital gave his work is indicated by the volume's length. A people with a bright future would surely have deserved a longer book. Vital's analysis, however, is that now, at the end of the twentieth century, "the survival of Jewry as a discrete people... is entirely in doubt.... Where there was once a single... peo- ple-indeed, a nation-there is now a sort of archipelago of discrete islands composed of rather shaky communities of all qualities, shapes, and sizes, in which the Island of Israel, as it were, is fated increasingly to be in a class by itself" (pp. 146-147). Vital dates the background for this forecast to 1789, when the equality offered to the Jews of France entailed the elimination of intermediate classes or corporations between the citizen and the state. The granting of citizenship implied forgoing isolation in self-organized communities-the exclusivity</page><page sequence="2">370 BOOK REVIEWS that had kept the Jews apart from others, and united among themselves. The revolutionaries were interested in the universal, but the Jews were particu- laristic. The upshot is that with their plunge into modernity, as Vital calls it, the Jews had to clarify their political and cultural identity. Those who were interested in the rights granted to them as individuals had to devise an alter- native for the national structure and conception that had characterized Jewry in the past. Thus began a process that would lead to divisions among Jews themselves. A primary factor undermining a world Jewish collective at the present time, according to Vital, is the establishment of Israel as a political entity that purportedly speaks on behalf of world Jewry. While Israeli Jews, who live in a free parliamentary democracy, are constrained in their political behavior out of loyalty to their country, the leaders of world Jewry (who are not even necessarily elected) feel free to criticize Israel in a manner that is openly and manifestly political. Despite the leaders' involvement in Israeli affairs, Vital argues that only a minority of diaspora Jews are concerned about the inner cultural life of Judaism. Emancipation, migration, and war- fare have taken their toll on how the different segments of Judaism view and identify themselves and their relationships with fellow Jews, to the point that one cannot speak of a united Jewry. Secularist trends are dominant, and intermarriage and assimilation are rampant. The upshot is that one may not only ask whether the Jews are a nation, as they were in the past, but even whether they wish to be one. There are surely those who will disagree with Vital. Indeed, his book is so short, and its reference notes so limited, that it is essentially an essay, and might best have been published in a journal of thought with accompanying discussion of its thesis. The state of Jewry in the United States (and what are the proper indicators to use in measuring its vitality) is the subject of a great debate among sociologists of the Jews as well as political scientists, but there is no reference in the book to these discussions. The work done on the "civil religion" of Israel and of American Jews seems to be more relevant to understanding Jewry at this time than is given credit by the author. An ana- lytical survey and critique of the work of social scientists dealing with the fields discussed would have given more credibility to his position and would seem to have been warranted for a book published by a university press. Having said this, let me note that Vital's chapter on the role of Jews in his- tory and historiography is particularly illuminating and would well benefit sociologists who think that social surveys provide all the information need-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 371 ed for understanding contemporary Jewry. All in all, Vital does make a very interesting contribution to the discussion and debate about what is happen- ing to the Jewish people. The particular manner in which it is presented, however, is more suited for those familiar with the topics discussed than for outsiders.
