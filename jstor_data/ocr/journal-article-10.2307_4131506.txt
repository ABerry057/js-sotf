<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 1 PREFACE With this issue of the AJSReview, I bring my editorship to a close. I am proud to present this special issue to the Review's readership. It marks a change from the normal patterns of the Review, in that this issue consists entirely of articles so- licited by the editors, revolving around the broad theme of the reverberations of the Bible in modern Hebrew literature and culture. Putting together an issue of this kind inevitably demands the conscientious work and cooperation of many people-especially in this case, as the theme is beyond my area of expertise. I would like to thank, first and foremost, Nehama Aschkenasy, the Guest Editor of this issue, for providing the expertise I lack. But even more, I want to thank her for her dogged commitment to this project, her gen- tle prodding when my attention was diverted elsewhere, her well calibrated edito- rial hand, and for being a pleasure to work with in all respects. In addition, I would like to thank all the contributors for their conscientious work and patience; Harvey Bock for expertly and graciously translating the arti- cles by A. B. Yehoshua and Malka Shaked from the Hebrew. He handled this dif- ficult and thankless task superbly; Hadassah Stein for her meticulous and excellent work translating Gershon Shaked's article; Deborah Arotsky, an undergraduate stu- dent on leave from Princeton, who interned for the Center for Judaic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Connecticut, Stamford, and worked tirelessly to reconcile the translation of Gershon Shaked's article with the writer's revisions; the community Board of the Center for Judaic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Connecticut, Stamford, for defraying part of the cost of the Shaked translation; the Board of Directors of the Association for Jewish Studies for de- fraying the remainder of the cost of this translation; Sara Horowitz, member of the editorial board, who carefully read some of the contributions and made sugges- tions for revisions; and Sidra DeKoven-Ezrahi, who read Nehama's Aschkenasy's article and made insightful suggestions. Finally, I wish to thank the editorial staff at Cambridge University Press for their professional work on this issue, and all the issues we have published with them. The reins of the AJS Review turn now to Hillel Kieval and Martin Jaffee; I wish them every success and hope that they find the experience of editing this journal as rich and rewarding as I did.
