<plain_text><page sequence="1">Miriam Bodian. Hebrew ofthe Portuguese Nation: Conversos and Community in Early Modern Amsterdam. The Modem Jewish Experience. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997. xiii, 219 pp. The Portuguese Jewish community of Amsterdam was one of the most dynamic centers of Jewish life in the seventeenth century. Composed almost entirely of Portuguese "New Christians" who had decided to abandon the Iberian peninsula and live openly as Jews in a location where, until the 1590s, no Jews had resided, it was a community created, as it were, ex nihilo. Many of its members were quite sophisticated, educated in the best universities of Portugal, renowned physicians, prosperous international merchants. They knew that they wanted to be Jewish. But they had little specific knowledge about what this meant, what was required of them, where the boundary lines of dissent would be drawn. While considerable attention has been paid to what has been called the religion of the Marranos, less has been paid to their sense of ethnic identity. This is the focus of Miriam Bodian's new study. She reviews and synthesizes a massive amount of scholarship, written in Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Hebrew as well as English, thereby making this material available to those of us who do not command all these languages. But this valuable work of synthesis also presents a distinctive approach to the subject, exploring important issues of the sociology of religion without the technical terminology and jargon that often seem to obfuscate. She first sketches the background on the Iberian peninsula, which produced the community of Portuguese New Christians. Then she treats the "founding</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 397 legends" of the Amsterdam community, and its establishment and growth during its early years. At this point, a chronological narrative is abandoned in favor of a conceptual organization, with chapters devoted to the relationship with the Dutch hosts, the memories carried to Amsterdam from the Portuguese converso past, the process of "rejudaization" by which Jewish knowledge, convictions, and loyalties were engendered and subversive ideas opposed, and the ways in which the distinctive ethnic identity of the "Portuguese nation" was cultivated and maintained. With regard to the Dutch, both Portuguese and Jewish aspects of their identity were emphasized to good effect: the Portuguese background ensuring their value for international commerce, their Jewishness ensuring loyalty to their new home in times of conflict with Spain (p. 64). But these elements were sometimes in tension. The Portuguese Jews in Amsterdam often felt closer to other Portuguese conversos living as Christians in Antwerp or Bordeaux, with whom a network of communications was maintained, than to the Ashkenazic Jews living a few blocks away, whose children were prohibited from attending the communal school (p. 131). How did the Amsterdam Jews feel about conversos who remained in Portugal? What about other Sephardic Jews, emigres from Spain in 1492, who had not shared in the Portuguese experience? Children of Portuguese Jewish fathers and Christian mothers? Converts to Judaism whose fathers were not Portuguese? In cases such as these, Bodian shows that the rulings imposed in the community sometimes diverged from rabbinic norms. Much of this material is drawn from what she calls the "quintessentially 'Portuguese' institution," the Dotar Confraternity for providing dowries to orphans and impoverished brides, about which Bodian has already published an illuminating study comparing it with its Venetian elder-sister society. Membership was (with rare special exceptions) restricted to Jews of the Portuguese nation, or at least Sephardim, and "their descendants by the masculine or feminine line" (p. 48). An illegitimate daughter of a Portuguese father and Christian mother could enter the dowry lottery, but an illegitimate daughter of a Portuguese mother could not (p. 115). Such a rule illustrates the "reinforcement of Iberian sociosexual attitudes, even when these were at odds with rabbinic principles" (p. 115). The argument for the enduring legacy of Iberian values is not always so persuasive. There is no question that members of the Portuguese "nation" were proud of their nobility of lineage and "purity of blood" (p. 86), and that these values corresponded to values of Iberian society. But Martin Luther, in</page><page sequence="3">398 BOOK REVIEWS his diatribe "On the Jews and Their Lies," spends considerable time talking about similar themes: "There is one thing about which [the Jews] boast and pride themselves beyond measure, and that is their descent from the foremost people on earth, from Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob.... Therefore they boast of being the noblest, yes, the only noble people on earth." Luther was not talking specifically about Iberian Jews. This raises the question of how necessary the Iberian background was in fostering pride of descent. Another example: Bodian discusses the controversy of 1635 over the "etemality of punishment" after death, based on the study by Alexander Altmann (pp. 121-122). She presents this as "a clear case of 'converso' innovation confronting rabbinic orthodoxy" (p. 121). But this is not so clear at all. As Altmann showed, the issue has philosophical dimensions (is infinite punishment for finite sin compatible with divine justice?) and hinges largely on the status of kabbalistic sources in Jewish theology. The converso dimension cut both ways: the "conservative" Rabbi Saul Levi Morteira, insisting on the eternality of punishment, warned that promising ultimate salvation to all Jewish souls, regardless of their sinfulness, would undermine the determination of conversos to leave Portugal, and even facilitate the decision of some newcomers to return to the "lands of idolatry." Furthermore, Christians were also debating this problem. In short, the converso dimension was one component of a complex issue; it is not obvious that it drove the controversy. There is still substantial source material, both in manuscript and in print, that has not been used in this work, notably the sermons that were a primary instrument for the rejudaization of the former conversos and furnished an ongoing rebuttal of unacceptable doctrines, both from within and outside the community. While it makes no claim to be a definitive history of the Portuguese community of Amsterdam in all its dynamics, this book is the best synthetic study of the problems of identity among these early modem "new Jews."
