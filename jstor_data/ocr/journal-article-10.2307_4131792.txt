Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2000. x, 258 pp. This is a fine book, one which constructs its tasks with seriousness and depth. Grossman's book is all about the place of Yiddish in German cultural and intellectual contexts. The shortcomings are more a product of the limitations of the discipline than of the author. The introductory chapter "The Return of Yiddish and Other Considerations" sets the parameters for the book. Grossman begins by noting the "current vogue" interest in Yiddish and seeks to put this into cultural context. This is followed by a statement of his general theoretical approach to "discourse," and his specific task: to relate the presentation of Yiddish ... to various fields of knowledge (such as language, philosophy, linguistics, and Jewish history, literary forms ... ) and to ideologies of German and Jewish culture, conceptions of peoples, na- tions, and national language and to various strategies resorted to ... for con- trolling the image of Yiddish" (p. 5).' Chapter One, "Herder, Humboldt, and the Language of Diaspora Jews," is a well-organized discussion of German Enlightenment views concerning lan- guage, Jews, and Jews' language. Chapter Two, "Yiddish and the Invention of the German Jew," discusses Jewish discourse on language and culture within the new paradigms. This chapter includes detailed discussion of Moses Mendelssohn and of the individuals and writings associated with the Verein ffir Cultur und Wis- senschaft der Juden (founded 1819). Grossman provides valuable discussion of the scholarly agenda set by Zunz and others, for example, of Zunz' efforts to set the terms for "Re-defining the Canon of Jewish literature" (pp. 101-108). Chapter Three, "Language and Control: The Pedagogy and Performance of Yiddish in Lin- guistic and Theatrical Literature," deals with the rise of German studies of Yid- 1. Grossman cites his work as owing to two earlier works on Jewish speech in German litera- ture: Mark Gelber, "Das Judendeutsch in der deutschen Literatur: einige Beispiele von den friihesten Lexika bis zu Gustav Freytag und Thomas Mann," in Juden in der deutschen Literatur (1986), pp. 162- 178; and Matthias Richter, Die Sprachejiidischer Figuren in der deutschen Literatur.: Studien zu Form und Function (Gdttingen: Wallstein, 1995). 151</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews dish language and the portrayal of Yiddish in German theater. Grossman's dis- cussion of German interest in the study of Yiddish, while helpful, is not new; much derives from known Yiddish scholarship. However, Grossman's lengthy discussion on the portrayal of Yiddish in German theatrical literature is valuable in two sig- nificant ways. First, he presents data and analysis. Second, he goes beyond much German-centered scholarship by systematically distinguishing between Yiddish and Yiddish-influenced German,2 and between the (German) portrayal of Yiddish and Yiddish itself. Chapter Four, "The Threat to German Culture: The Function of Yiddish in German Realism after 1848," discusses historical, cultural, and economic devel- opments in the nineteenth century and provides detailed case-study and analysis of Freytag's Soll und Haben (1855), Raabe's Hungerpastor (1864), and Franzos' works. Grossman's comparative analysis of these works, authors, and times is nuanced and solid. A concluding chapter, "Beyond the Nineteenth-Century View of Yiddish," brings discussion up to the present, including the rise of a German- Jewish "Re-discovery of Yiddish"; a run-through of current approaches to nation, nationalism, and culture; and an appeal for mutual respect among diverse groups in the modern world. Grossman's book presents a full, multi-faceted treatment of precisely what he sets out to examine: the "role" of Yiddish in German contexts. Grossman ap- propriately subjects issues, ideological positions, and data to critical scrutiny. What is missing, however, is a sense of a Jewish internal dynamic, outside the German context. In this Jewish dynamic, Jews may contextualize, react to, or modify their views about, or use of, Yiddish, Hebrew, and indeed even German, on Jewish terms. To be sure, the Jewish internal dynamic interacts with external forces; however, a recognition of (Jewish) agency all too often receives short shrift in German-centered scholarship dealing with Yiddish.3 To his credit, Gross- man uses significantly more primary Yiddish scholarship than is the norm in Ger- manistic scholarship. Scholarship in one discipline typically reduces and simpli- fies when incorporating the scholarship of another. Still, it is problematic to this reviewer (writing from the perspective of Yiddish and Ashkenazic Studies) that Germanistic scholarship dealing with the rise of modern European Jewry typ- ically focuses on the same limited cast of Jewish figures (Mendelssohn, Fried- linder, Lewald, Heine). Clearly, Enlightenment (both Aufklirung and Haskala/ Haskole) and post-Enlightenment debates about the nature of language, culture, and nation are part of a European elite discourse of the times; thus, the same cast of Jewish figures will repeatedly surface in academic discussion. However, it would be useful to provide a basic mapping of the Jewish-internal intellectual 2. See Neil Jacobs, "On the investigation of 1920s Vienna Jewish Speech: Ideology and Lin- guistics."

Finally, Grossman rightly holds many issues up to critical light, yet he leaves unproblematized his use of Haskala, mitzvot, etc. (vs. Ashkenazic pro- nunciation Haskole, mitsves, etc.). The issue is not that Grossman uses forms re- flecting modern Ivrit. Rather, what is lacking is some overt contextualization con- cerning the use of one Hebrew model over the other. Grossman could, for example, merely declare that the canonized forms in English are borrowed from Ivrit. In a book that deals so finely with issues of nuance and perspective, some statement is necessary. Neil G. Jacobs The Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio 4.
