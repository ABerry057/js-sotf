<plain_text><page sequence="1">"KILL YOUR ORDINARY COMMON SENSE AND MAYBE YOU'LL BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND": AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST by DAVID C. JACOBSON When Aharon Appelfeld emigrated in his early teens to the Land of Israel on the eve of the establishment of the state, he and other Holocaust survivors his age felt ashamed of their experiences of suffering in the war, which seemed to them to be so meaningless and insignificant in comparison to the constructive tasks of nation building that had been undertaken by the yishuv. We arrived in the Land [of Israel] in 1946. We were about twelve or thirteen years old, with the suffering of the years tied to us like a hard coil devoid of meaning.... Our suffering was not only lacking in meaning, but also shame- ful. In the Land [of Israel] life hummed with deeds, purpose, and resourceful- 129</page><page sequence="2">130 DAVID C. JACOBSON ness, while our tortured childhood was, as it were, bent further under the burden of all those deeds.' These young survivors were also greatly disturbed by the crude ways that the yishuv ignored their personal suffering and focused instead on discover- ing a national significance to the Holocaust. The days of the eve of the War of Independence were days of great excitement. Modest words and lofty words were mixed together. Expressions and slogans were created without much thought; the expression "Destruction and Revival" [hurban utekumah] was festively adopted, and connected with it were notions of cause and effect [sibbah vetotsa'ah], rebuke and justification [tokhe- hah vetsidduk hadin], mourning followed by celebration ['evel veyom tov]. In short, it is practically a law, the slogan proclaimed, that on the ashes of one period will rise another period.2 To add insult to injury, the historical interpretive scheme of the yishuv reflected negatively on the moral character of the victims and survivors of the war by suggesting that their fate was due to the sin of having made exces- sively naive assumptions about the future of the Jews in the diaspora that prevented them from emigrating to the Land of Israel before the war. The application of the interpretation swooped down on us and without mercy established parallels: exile-redemption, Zionism versus assimilation, the guilty as opposed to the blameless, the wise as opposed to the naive. There was a terrible transparency to these analogies.3 As an adult, Appelfeld continued to struggle with the impulse he dis- covered in his newly adopted society to retreat from the horror of the Holo- caust into the comfort of facile explanations. This impulse was particularly painful for a writer like Appelfeld who sought to be a witness to the suffer- 1.

His difficulties and those of his society in relating to the Holocaust were the result of the vast difference between the horrors of the war and the realities of everyday experience characteristic of life before the war and life after the war. All that was revealed to the Jew in those years was greater than the measure of his logic or the measure of his soul. It was, in essence, the space of the horror, and when he left it, he only sought to see in it a nightmare, a breach in his life which must be healed very quickly. .. . And while the survivor tells, reveals, at the same time he conceals. For it is impossible not to tell, but it is also impos- sible to live in this space. This revealment and concealment has continued until this very day, and it is that which creates a barrier between the apocalyptic world and the world of life that is almost impossible to bridge.4 This tension between the logic of everyday explanations and the reality of the Holocaust encouraged Appelfeld and other survivors to avoid reveal- ing the true nature of the events they felt that neither they nor their society could stand to confront. And just as the [survivor] witness could not continue to stand in the space of this terror, neither could the Jew who had not experienced it. A kind of secret covenant was created between the survivor witness and the one to whom, as it were, this testimony was directed, a covenant of silence in the path of which many misunderstandings have accumulated.5 As time went on, the society of the newly founded State of Israel, like the prestate yishuv society, persisted in understanding the Holocaust in a man- ner that did not at all reflect the reality of the survivors' suffering. When the Holocaust survivors made their first attempts to convey the reality of the Holocaust to those who had not experienced it, the latter, unable to compre- hend the suffering experienced by the former, created a system of words that attempted to capture the complexity of the Holocaust experience by labeling it with terms so abstract and overly used that they served the purpose of pro- tecting people from fully confronting that experience. 4.

JACOBSON The apocalyptic visions were gradually translated into a plethora of words and concepts: trauma, horror, Holocaust [sho'ah]-words and concepts that con- note mainly evasion, distancing, and at times in a vulgar sort of way [the notion]: But it happened there. It was the conditions of the exile that created them. We are free of them.6 Those who did not experience the Holocaust were further protected from its reality by the energy focused on historical studies and institutional com- memorations of the Holocaust. And since the testimony was not able to strike roots in life, it was pushed aside into archives, into memorials, into the sterile space of scholarship. And the explanation quickly became a historical question. What happened and how did it happen? It would appear that these are appropriate questions. Except that we have the experience to know that such questions function less as testi- mony to suffering and more as a loose bandage on a wound that refuses to heal.7 Furthermore, the survival of the Jewish people after World War II and the creation of the State of Israel provided a false comfort to those who had not experienced the war. And in addition a certain satisfaction was added: Look, we are still alive despite everything; the evil designs did not prevail. And not only that but the destruction brought revival and rebirth. The bitter lesson became a clear lesson. Who could not feel that such language, even if it is language, is all an outer layer? He who attempts to plaster over the terror in such a manner and with such a choice of words demonstrates that he is outside the space of that terror; and not only that but that he is rooted in his old concepts, the distance of which between them and what happened is the abyss.8 Appelfeld's sense that the Hebrew language was persistently being used in Israel not to reveal the reality of the Holocaust but to conceal it led him initially to despair of ever finding a way to convey the experiences of those who were in the war to those Israelis who were not. It was only when he read the German writings of the pre-Holocaust Jewish writer Franz Kafka, 6. Ibid. 7. Ibid., pp. 20-21. 8. Ibid., p. 21.</page><page sequence="5">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 133 Appelfeld reports, that he found works reflecting the reality of the Holo- caust and a literary style that could be a model for a post-Holocaust Hebrew literary expression of the experiences of his own generation of survivors. Help came from a place where we did not expect it, from a man who had not been in the Holocaust, but who already foresaw the horrors in the tranquil days of the declining Hapsburg empire, the Jew Franz Kafka. As soon as we touched the pages of The Trial the feeling did not leave us that he had been with us in all our wanderings. Every line spoke for us. In Kafka's language we found on the one hand suspicion and doubting and on the other hand the sick- ened longing for an explanation. Kafka suddenly returned the words to us. If not for Kafka it is doubtful whether we would have had the strength to arouse from the depths even one word. From our point of view he was not only a teacher but a redeemer.9 Appelfeld turned to the writings of a Hebrew pre-Holocaust author as well: Hayyim Nahman Bialik. It is ironic that Appelfeld came to rely on the works of Bialik as an inspiration for his own writing. When he first attended school in the Land of Israel, Appelfeld writes, Bialik's poems were taught mainly as texts that condemned Jewish passivity in the pogroms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and prophesied the destruction of European Jewry as a result of that passivity. This approach to Bialik's poetry strongly suggested that the victims and survivors of the Holocaust were guilty in their inability to adopt the forceful Zionist stance that the teachers believed Bialik advocated. For a long time Appelfeld was afraid to even open a book of Bialik's poetry for fear of suffering the wrath of the poet's rebuke. It was only after many years that he could see beyond his teachers' superficial readings of Bialik's works. Appelfeld could then appre- ciate Bialik as an author who effectively expressed a sensitivity to the issues that the suffering of the Holocaust would raise. Bialik's poetry is a kind of an early feeling, an early warning, supplication, and prayer for the granting of meaning to suffering and thereby to life. There was no one who felt like him that Jewish life was being emptied not only of its metaphysical content, but also of human hope.'? 9. Ibid., p. 15. 10. Ibid., pp. 91-92.</page><page sequence="6">134 DAVID C. JACOBSON How could the works of Kafka and Bialik, who both died before the Holocaust, function as literary models for a Holocaust survivor such as Appelfeld in search of a means for self-expression? The answer to this ques- tion lies in the realization that Kafka, Bialik, and Appelfeld had in common analogous experiences of the arbitrary eruption of evil which strongly sug- gested to them that human existence is absurd and that the cosmos is not based on a moral order and is not essentially beneficent to human beings. For all three authors these experiences occurred in the contexts of personal family circumstances and of national fate. For Kafka the experiences involved his difficult relationship with his father and the insecurity of his Jewish identity during the period of the cultural disintegration of assimilated Central European Jewry; for Bialik the experiences included the psychologi- cal trauma of his father's death when he was a child and the physical and cultural disintegration of Eastern European Jewry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; while for Appelfeld the experiences were those of the Holocaust that caused the death of his mother and the destruction of the world of Central European Jewry in which he had spent the formative years of his childhood." In his discussion of the dilemma of the Holocaust survivor who seeks to bear witness to his suffering, Appelfeld refers to a kind of "revealment and concealment [gilluy vekhissuy] [which] has continued until this very day and ... which creates a barrier between the apocalyptic world and the world of life that is almost impossible to bridge."'2 In the works of Kafka and Bialik, Appelfeld discovered attempts to establish connections between the "apoca- lyptic world" of experiences that suggest the absurdity of human existence and the more typical everyday experiences of the "world of life" that inspire hope by suggesting that human existence has meaning. He saw in those attempts literary models to aid him in fulfilling his aspiration to convey to postwar Israeli society the suffering of the Holocaust. He also saw in them models of how to convey his personal search for a meaning to that suffering 11. Appelfeld is quoted in an interview as stating, "I don't think that any Holocaust sur- vivor can free himself of the impression that the world is essentially dominated by an arbitrary and merciless force." See Esther Fuchs, Encounters with Israeli Authors (Marblehead, Mass.: Micah Publications, 1982), p. 59. In analyzing Appelfeld's earlier fiction, Gershon Shaked notes that in his writings Appelfeld continues the tradition of pre-Holocaust Jewish writers to convey the horrors of modern Jewish experience. See Gershon Shaked, Gal hadash basipporet ha'ivrit (Merhavia and Tel Aviv: Sifriat Poalim, 1971), p. 157. 12.

In his essay "Hope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka," Albert Camus notes the tendency of Kafka's fiction to juxtapose the characters' everyday experiences with their experiences of the absurd. Although, for example, Joseph K. in the novel The Trial is faced with an absurd accusation of guilt, he is not astonished by the accusation, reacts to it as if it is a natural occurrence, and continues to live his life, "not neglect[ing] to love, to eat, or to read his paper,"'3 as if the absurd has not invaded his life. Much of the meaning of Kafka's fiction, Camus believes, derives from this juxtaposition of what he calls the "two worlds.. . of everyday life on the one hand, and on the other, . . . of supernatural anxiety."'4 Kafka makes this connection between the everyday and the absurd, according to Camus, because it is the most effective way to convey the absurd to those readers who dwell in the world of everyday logic and meaning: "Thus it is that Kafka expresses tragedy by the everyday and the absurd by the logical.""' The absurd and the everyday come together in Kafka's fiction not only as a technique to make the absurd plausible to the reader, but also as a way to convey the human tendency to escape the horrors of the absurd by cling- ing to the hopefulness of normal experience. As Camus notes, Kafka's characters do not fully surrender to despair despite the absurdity of their condition. In their persistent hope to resolve their predicaments, these characters find a way to escape absurdity at least until the point when it overwhelms them, as it does with the execution of Joseph K. at the end of The Trial. Appelfeld's reference to "revealment and concealment" in his discussion of the relationship between "the apocalyptic world" of the absurd and the everyday "world of life" calls to mind for the Hebrew reader Bialik's well- known essay, "Gilluy vekhissuy balashon" ("Revealment and Concealment in Language").'6 This essay on language, written by Bialik in 1915 in the midst of the upheavals suffered by European Jewry in the period before and 13.

JACOBSON during World War I, contains insights that are strikingly applicable to the experiences of Holocaust survivors and to the process of their coming to terms with the Holocaust and conveying its reality to those who did not experience it. While, to my knowledge, Appelfeld never explicitly refers to this essay as having influenced him, given Appelfeld's stated attraction to Bialik as a literary mentor, it is likely that he found this essay to be meaning- ful, especially since it conveys Bialik's reflections on the relationship between the absurd and the everyday, as well as the relationship between the absurd and hope.7 The central point of Bailik's essay is that for the most part, language does not play the role of revealing reality, but rather the role of concealing from human beings the void of moral chaos and absurdity that lies at the heart of reality. Bialik does not completely condemn this natural function of language to reveal rather than to conceal, for he believes that it is only the meaning that language provides as an escape from absurdity that allows people to continue living and to experience some degree of happiness and hope in their lives. At the same time, however, Bialik makes clear in the essay that despite the inevitable role of language to conceal the absurd nature of existence, no culture can be truly creative and no literature can adequately reflect the truth without the efforts of writers (in particular of poets) to devise a language that will reveal at least glimpses of the absurd by challenging the commonly accepted language that conceals it. It is clear from Bialik's analysis of the role of language, Camus's remarks on Kafka's fiction, and Appelfeld's report of his experiences as a Holocaust survivor in Israel, that any writer who seeks to engage his readers in a con- frontation with the absurd undertakes a task which is far from easy. Such a writer must challenge the ways that the language of a culture tends to con- firm the human tendency of the members of that culture to flee the absurd and to interpret reality as more beneficent than a confrontation with the absurd would indicate. Critics have noted that Appelfeld's fiction is characterized by its indirect portrayal of the Holocaust.'8 In his short stories and novels Appelfeld does 17. Leon I.

Instead, he tends to portray either Jews in Europe on the eve of the Holocaust, Jews in Europe in hiding from the Nazis during the war, or Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in Italy or in Israel during the years following the war. Appelfeld's novel Badenheim, 'ir nofesh ("Baden- heim, Resort Town," published in English as Badenheim 1939) is a prime example of a work of fiction in which Appelfeld portrays Jews in Europe on the eve of the Holocaust."9 It has, however, a particular significance as one of Appelfeld's most direct attempts to convey the essential nature of the Holocaust experience. It thus serves as an illuminating example of the task Appelfeld has undertaken to convey to Israeli society the reality of suffering in the Holocaust. In his portrayal of the nature of the Holocaust in Badenheim, 'ir nofesh, Appelfeld appears to be concerned primarily with the relationship of two groups living an everyday existence to the absurd evil of the Holocaust: the victims, whose prewar everyday lives were invaded by the Holocaust, and the readers of the novel, who live an everyday postwar existence, to whom he wishes to convey the reality of the Holocaust. He relates the everyday world of the victims before the war and of his readers after the war to the Holocaust in ways that mirror the insights of his literary mentors Kafka and Bialik on the relationship between the absurd and the everyday and the relationship between absurdity and hope. As we have learned from Appelfeld's remarks, Israeli society has strongly resisted the notion that Holocaust suffering was too absurd an eruption of evil into everyday life to be explained by the logic of everyday experience. Israelis have thus anesthetized themselves from the absurd reality of the Holocaust by seeking to explain the Holocaust in a manner which Appelfeld deems to be overly superficial. Appelfeld, therefore, sought in Badenheim, 'ir nofesh to portray the absurdity of the Holocaust in such a Responses to Catastrophe in Hebrew Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), pp. 207-208. 19. An earlier shorter version of Badenheim, 'ir nofesh was published under the title Baden- helm 1939 in Moznayim 36 (1972): 21-35. For an English translation of this version by Betsy Rosenberg, see Ezra Spicehandler and Curtis Arnson, eds., New Writing in Israel (New York: Schocken Books, 1976), pp. 69-100. The later, expanded version, which this paper analyzes, was first published under the title Badenheim, 'ir nofesh in Siman keri'ah 3-4 (1974): 287-334.

JACOBSON way as to overcome the resistance of his readers to confronting the Holocaust and to make its reality plausible to them without the aid of the logic of everyday explanations. From Appelfeld's point of view, Israeli society has demonstrated a par- ticularly inaccurate understanding of the reality of the Holocaust when it has labeled the reactions of the Holocaust victims and survivors to their fate as having been overly passive. Appelfeld sought to dispel that misunder- standing by portraying in Badenheim, 'ir nofesh the process whereby the absurd invaded the everyday life of the victims and elicited a natural human tendency toward optimism that interfered with the victims' full understand- ing of their fate. He makes clear in his portrayal of the response of the victims that their apparent acceptance of the Holocaust evil was due to the calling forth of the very mechanism of distancing oneself from the absurd that his readers who did not experience the Holocaust tend to call forth. What emerges is a curious parallel between the response of those who first viewed the Holocaust as victims and those who continue to view the Holo- caust as observers after the fact. Just as those who lived after the war have devised techniques of perception that shield them from the true reality of the Holocaust, so did those who experienced the war. Such a parallel suggests how inappropriate it is for those who live after the war to judge those who were its victims.20 Two types of passages in the novel are particularly effective in linking together the confrontation with the absurdity of arbitrary evil by the victims who are characters in the novel and the novel's readers. In one type of pas- sage, the evil is presented to the victims by the authorities in such a way as to encourage the victims to devise interpretations of reality that will conceal the evil from themselves. Paradoxically, in this same type of passage, the evil is portrayed by the author in such a way as to allow the readers to overcome their tendency to conceal from themselves the true nature of the evil. In the 20. Alan Mintz traces Appelfeld's attempts in his earlier fiction to link the responses of the victims to the Holocaust with that of those who did not experience the Holocaust: "Appelfeld's goal is our knowledge of [the Holocaust] world; he wants us to accept the reality of it against instincts of evasion every bit as strong as his characters'. To the extent to which Appelfeld suc- ceeds in rendering this given and determined world fictionally plausible, to that extent he manages to purchase our acceptance of his characters' humanity." See Mintz, Hurban, p. 214.

These victims detach themselves from the logic of everyday explanations that has tended to conceal the reality of the evil from most of the victims. This detachment involves some experience with hallucinations, suicidal despair, or an obsession. At the same time, such pas- sages convey to the readers a vision of the absurdity of arbitrary evil in a symbolic manner that prevents the readers from fleeing into the logic of everyday explanations, as they might have done if confronted with a more starkly revealed vision of that evil. The Absurd and the Everyday Badenheim, 'ir nofesh is the story of the gradual transformation of the fic- tional Austrian resort town of Badenheim, visited mainly by assimilated Jewish vacationers, into a ghetto from which all Jews are deported, pre- sumably to die in concentration camps. One of the most striking features of this novel is that it contains no direct references to such Holocaust termino- logy as "Nazis," "ghettos," or "concentration camps." Indeed, the manner in which the transformation of Badenheim into a ghetto is described differs significantly from historical accounts of the Nazis' war against the Jews familiar to Appelfeld's readers. Compared to those accounts, the experi- ences that the Jewish victims of the novel undergo are relatively benign. As in a work of fiction by Kafka, the absurdity of Nazi evil is portrayed by the author and perceived by the victims as a manifestation of everyday reality. The transformation of Badenheim into a ghetto is accomplished by means of the activities of the town's increasingly powerful Sanitation Department. The Sanitation Department begins by conducting investigations, then physi- cally isolates Badenheim from the outside world, and eventually registers all Jews residing in or visiting the town-all in preparation for their deporta- tion. In each passage where the Sanitation Department is mentioned, both the readers and the victims in the novel are introduced to a reality which they need to explain to themselves. The readers are presented with a Holocaust world removed from the "normal" Holocaust world of the Nazis with which they are familiar, while the victims face a government agency that has been granted powers that it had never before possessed. As he portrays the activi- ties of the Sanitation Department and the reactions to those activities by the</page><page sequence="12">140 DAVID C. JACOBSON Jews of Badenheim, Appelfeld is able to reveal to his readers a view of the true reality of the Holocaust, since they are freed of the distancing mechan- ism of the logic of everyday explanations that would normally come in to play for them when they contemplate scenes of Nazi brutality. At the same time, the portrayal of the Sanitation Department's activities conveys the means by which the Nazis presented the evil to the victims in such a way as to cleverly conceal the true reality of that evil from the victims by playing into their natural human urge to understand their situation in terms of the logic of everyday explanations and thus persist in hoping for the best. The first indication of the new role that the Sanitation Department is to play in Badenheim occurs in the second chapter, when Martin, the town pharmacist, is visited in his pharmacy by a representative of the Depart- ment. At about ten o'clock an inspector from the Sanitation Department appeared with orders to carry out an inspection. He wanted to know all kinds of pecu- liar details. The ownership of the business, if Martin had inherited it, when and from whom he had acquired it, how much it was worth. Martin, surprised, explained that everything had been whitewashed and thoroughly disinfected. The inspector took out a yardstick and measured. He left abruptly without apologizing or thanking Martin. (p. 8)21 Assuming that readers of this passage have some familiarity with the his- tory of the Holocaust, they will recognize that the questions Martin is asked about the ownership of the pharmacy and its worth hint at a plan to confis- cate the business from him, as businesses were confiscated by the Nazis from Jews and turned over to Aryans. However, by leaving out some of the most disturbing historically recognizable details, the author presents the readers with a Holocaust experience that appears to be significantly less horrible than they would expect. At the same time, the passage serves to portray the authorities' method of exercising their power over the victims without disclosing their ultimate purpose, and thereby encouraging the victims to keep themselves from per- ceiving the arbitrary evil that is their fate. While, as the narrator relates, Martin is "surprised" by the visit, it represents a sufficiently innocuous exer- 21. The page numbers of passages refer to Aharon Appelfeld, Badenheim 1939, trans. Dalya Bilu (Boston: David R. Godine, 1980).</page><page sequence="13">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 141 cise of governmental power that he immediately resorts to a plausible interpretation that would allow this strange visit to fit into normal everyday reality. He fails, thereby, to recognize the possible danger that might result from a government agency overstepping the bounds of its normal authority and misreads the situation by answering not the questions he is asked regarding the ownership of the business and its worth, but rather the ques- tions he would normally expect the Sanitation Department to ask him about the sanitary condition of the pharmacy. Following the visit, Martin further conceals the reality of the danger from himself by refraining from getting angry at the arbitrary and inexplicable activity of the government agency. Instead, like a typical character in Kakfa's fiction, he assumes that the authorities were justified in what they did, for perhaps he really had violated the official sanitary regulations of the town. As the Sanitation Department becomes increasingly involved in the lives of the victims, its actions continue to resemble only to a limited extent the brutality of the Nazis as recorded in historical accounts. This method of portraying the growing intensification of Nazi persecution leading ultimately to genocide continues to prevent the readers from viewing the Holocaust through the distancing lenses of the logic of everyday explanations. At the same time, this method continues to convey the means by which the Nazis presented their evil reality to the vic- tims in forms that were close enough to everyday reality to keep the victims from fully appreciating the danger they were in and to allow them to inter- pret their situation in a hopeful manner. The next official act of the Department is to announce that it will begin an investigation of Badenheim, the purpose of which is not at first made clear. The announcement is conveyed by means of a notice placed on the town bulletin board. The notice is of modest size, thereby muting any suspi- cion of danger. It is set forth in language typical of governmental bureaucra- cies, which would suggest that there is nothing out of the ordinary about it: "its jurisdiction ... had been extended .. . it had been authorized to conduct independent investigations" (p. I1). Its manner of investigating is thorough and according to procedures directed from a central authority. Yet, in contrast to the seeming lawfulness and propriety of the Department's actions, there is an ominous quality to the behavior of its inspectors as they "spread out" (in Hebrew: pashtu, which connotes an army maneuver) "without ceremony" (p. 11), thereby suggesting an arbitrary lawless quality to their investigations, of which the reader is gradually becoming aware, but which the victims have difficulty in recognizing.</page><page sequence="14">142 DAVID C. JACOBSON The victims tend to respond to this new activity of the Department by attempting to explain it in accordance with normal everyday expectations. Like Martin, the people assume that the government is acting in a moral and lawful manner: either the Sanitation Department is engaged in combating a health hazard, or the Sanitation inspectors are actually "income tax col- lectors in disguise" (p. 12) seeking to discover tax evaders. They therefore fully cooperate with the Department, not at all suspecting its evil designs. Gradually, the actions of the Sanitation Department appear to be even more (although not overly) ominous to the readers, yet the victims persist in explaining these actions in terms of everyday reality. The inspectors of the Sanitation Department were now spread all over the town. They took measurements, put up fences, and planted flags. Porters unloaded rolls of barbed wire, cement pillars, and all kinds of appliances suggestive of preparations for a public celebration. "There'll be fun and games this year." "How do you know?" "The Festival's probably going to be a big affair this year; otherwise, why would the Sanitation Department be going to all this trouble?" "You're right, I didn't realize." (p. 15) The detail of the "barbed wire" is sufficient to suggest the historical reality of the Holocaust to the readers, yet insignificant enough to avoid causing the readers to distance themselves from the overly familiar images of Holo- caust horrors. The victims, meanwhile, completely ignore the danger sign that the barbed wire represents, and they interpret what they see in light of their normal experience of the government as just and as seeking the best welfare of the populace. In the discussion of the victims quoted in this pas- sage we see their efforts to assert the logic of everyday explanations to make sense of the danger before their eyes: one speaker seeks to convince the other of his conclusion that the Department's actions can only be signs of a great resort season, which will include a successful arts festival. Even as the Department's activity becomes more intensified, the only explanation that the people can come up with is that this is a sign that Dr. Pappenheim, the impresario of the arts festival, is being honored by the government.</page><page sequence="15">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 143 The Department next undertakes an action which more clearly than any so far suggests signs of danger to be heeded by the victims: it orders all Jews residing in Badenheim to register at the Department. The portrayal of this act of discrimination is sufficiently removed from the full harshness of the early Nazi persecutions of the Jews that it prevents the readers from distanc- ing themselves from the reality represented by the scene. While as an act of discrimination it is very disturbing to the victims, it is presented to them in such a way as to encourage them to conceal from themselves the reality of their true fate. As was the Department's practice when launching the investi- gation, it informs the townspeople of their new activity by means of "a modest announcement" (p. 20). The Jews of Badenheim who are called upon to register are, more than at any point until then, greatly shaken, for they are forced by the order to register to acknowledge their Jewish identities in a society in which they have been attempting to assimilate. Some react to the forced reconsideration of their Jewish identity with shame and others with pride. Both reactions, however, have in common one characteristic: neither is based on a percep- tion of the truth that the registration is a first step toward their physical annihilation. Both the shame and the pride turn out to be emotions that help to conceal from the victims the reality of what is being done to them. Those characters, like Pappenheim the impresario, Samitzky, one of the musicians who performs in the local band during the resort season, and Frau Zauberblit, one of the vacationers, whose pride in their Jewish identity is aroused by the order, deal with this upheaval in their lives by means of humor. In one passage, Pappenheim and Samitzky joke about the registra- tion order. "That means me," said Samitsky. "And me," said Pappenheim. "Surely you don't want to deny me my Jewish- ness?" "I'd like to," said Samitzky, "but your nose testifies to the fact that you're no Austrian." (p. 20) When Frau Zauberblit approaches Samitzky to ask if he has registered yet, they have the following jocular exchange:</page><page sequence="16">144 DAVID C. JACOBSON "Not yet," said Samitzky. "I'm waiting for the right opportunity. Do I have the honor of addressing an Austrian citizen of Jewish origin?" "You do, sir." "In that case we shall soon be able to hold a family celebration." "Did you ever doubt it?" (p. 21) When these three characters go to register they do so in an upbeat mood, noting only the positive aspects of the experience, ignoring the fact that their human approach to the registration is negated by the mechanical, inhuman attitude of the Sanitation Department official who registers them. The official did not bat an eye at Zauberblit's declarations. She praised the department and said there was nothing like it for order and beauty. No wonder they had been promoted. Samitzky announced that his parents had arrived here fifty years ago and he had never since stopped feeling homesick. The official wrote down the required information expressionlessly like a steno- grapher. (p. 24) In contrast to Pappenheim, Samitzky, and Zauberblit, such characters as the vacationers Frau Milbaum and Dr. Langmann feel only the shame of their Jewish identity and refuse to accept that the order to register applies to them. When Frau Milbaum goes to register at the Sanitation Department, she is disturbed to find that the official ignores the fact that both her first and second husbands had been gentile Austrian noblemen, and that "apart from the name of her father, there was nothing at all on the form" (p. 44). She refuses to associate with the other Jews vacationing in Badenheim and declares that they are all "riffraff" (p. 44). Dr. Langmann resists the very idea of registering, declaring to Frau Milbaum that the only Jews who need to be singled out are those whose origins are in Eastern Europe, not Austrian-born Jews like him. As the registration proceeds, the Sanitation Department's actions take on what appears to the reader to be a more threatening quality. A barrier is placed at the entrance of the town, almost completely isolating it from the rest of the world. The Sanitation Department, however, blunts the effect of Badenheim's ghettoization by allowing the residents of the town to continue to enjoy physical and aesthetic pleasures.</page><page sequence="17">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 145 No one came in or went out. But the isolation wasn't total. The milkman brought milk in the morning and the fruit truck unloaded its cartons at the hotel. Both caf6s remained open and the band played every night.... (p. 38) While it becomes clearer as time goes on that the purpose of the registra- tion is to deport the Jews of Badenheim to Poland, the Department en- courages them to see this not as a journey to their destruction, but as the beginning of a new phase of their lives. The Sanitation Department now resembled a travel agency festooned with posters: LABOR IS OUR LIFE ... THE AIR IN POLAND IS FRESHER ... SAIL ON THE VISTULA ... THE DEVELOPMENT AREAS NEED YOU ... GET TO KNOW THE SLAVIC CULTURE. These and other slo- gans adorned the walls. (pp. 29-30) In another passage the effectiveness of the Department's portrayal of the impending journey is made clear. In the afternoon people began dropping in at the Sanitation Department. In the souvenir shop a map of Poland was already on sale. The adventurous, full of enthusiasm, spoke of the Vistula and the Carpathian mountains. The first shock was already over. (p. 39) The Department's misleading portrayal of reality plays into the natural tendency of several characters to view reality as essentially beneficent. They conclude that the journey they are to take to Poland will be advantageous either because it will return them to their Eastern European Jewish origins from which they had been fleeing, but to which they now really want to return, or because conditions in Poland are really superior to those in Austria. Pappenheim, Samitzky, and Zauberblit all express a nostalgic longing for Eastern Europe that on some level, they believe, will be fulfilled by the journey that the Department is to take them on. Samitzky is portrayed as having never gotten over his emigration from his native Poland to the west as a child. Zauberblit and Pappenheim, who are apparently native Austrians, affectionately recall visits with their Eastern European grand- parents. Zauberblit goes so far as to declare "that Poland was the most beautiful country of all, and that Yiddish was a lovely melodious language" (p. 31).</page><page sequence="18">146 DAVID C. JACOBSON Pappenheim, in particular, maintains an optimistic view that life will be even better for the Jews of Badenheim in Poland than in Austria. He makes such declarations as: "There are wonderful places in Poland" (p. 49) and "Artistic standards in Poland are high" (p. 54). He portrays the journey to Poland as an experience not to be feared, but rather to be welcomed as a desirable return to the Eastern European origins of the Jews of Badenheim. Throughout the period of the ghettoization of Badenheim, Pappenheim's optimistic projections serve the goal of the Sanitation Department to keep the Jews from facing the reality of their fate. He [Pappenheim] would tell them about Poland. About the wonderful world to which they were going. "Here we have no life left," he would say. "Here everything has become empty." (p. 97) Pappenheim maintains his optimistic interpretation of events until the very end of the novel. As the Jews are finally being cruelly shoved into train cars to be taken to the death camps, he remarks, "If the coaches are so dirty it must mean that we have not far to go" (p. 148). Throughout the novel, the victims of Badenheim protect themselves from the reality of their fate not only by seeking logical everyday explana- tions for what is happening to them and interpreting events optimistically, but also by intensifying their involvement with physical and cultural plea- sures and with professional pursuits. The vacationers obsessively indulge in the physical stimulation afforded by food, drink, drugs, and sexual affairs and in the cultural stimulation of Pappenheim's arts festival. In addition, a number of characters in the novel diligently pursue professional interests that they have carried over with them from the everyday world that preced- ed the time of the novel. Pappenheim runs around Badenheim worrying about the success of the arts festival, a professor spends his vacation correct- ing the galley proofs of his book, a businessman keeps telling people about the way he will have his company pay for his delay in Badenhein, a great conductor endlessly rehearses with his musicians, and a rabbi berates the people for their lack of commitment to traditional Judaism. These intensive involvements, however, do not provide the victims with a fully effective escape from facing the truth of what is happening to them. They therefore must keep turning to the logic of everyday explanations as a barrier to be desperately reinforced in order to avoid confronting the reality of their fate.</page><page sequence="19">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 147 Visions of the Absurd Not all the characters in the novel, however, succeed in concealing the reality of their evil fate from themselves by means of the logic of everyday explanations. In a conversation between two of the musicians it becomes clear how such logic can break down in the face of the absurdity of arbitrary evil. While Pappenheim and others have become convinced that the depor- tation to Poland holds out the promise of a new and better life, one of the musicians finds it difficult to find any meaning in the deportation. "What will they do with us there in Poland?" asked one of the musicians. "What do you mean? You'll be a musician, just as you've always been," said the friend sitting half asleep next to him. "In that case why send us there at all?" The friend sought an impressive formula. "Historical necessity," he said. "Kill me, I don't understand it. Ordinary common sense can't comprehend it." "In that case, kill your ordinary common sense and maybe you'll begin to understand." (p. 70) A limited number of characters in Badenheim, 'ir nofesh experience a per- sonal crisis when they are incapable of killing "the ordinary common sense" (in the original Hebrew: hasekhel hayashar) that calls forth the logic of everyday explanations once they have begun to perceive to some degree the evil that is their fate. These characters react to this perception by becoming preoccupied with hallucinations, suicidal despair, or an obsession. Their reactions serve not only to suggest what happens when everyday logic ceases to function effectively for the victims as a barrier to reality, but also to give the readers a more direct vision of the arbitrary evil of the Holocaust than they were afforded in the passages in which the victims were constantly pro- tecting themselves from perceiving that evil. The first of the characters who is unable to rely on everyday explanations to protect her from the reality of the evil is Martin's wife, Trude. She is portrayed at the beginning of the novel as sick and delirious with a view of the world as "poisoned and diseased" (p. 3). When she sees the first vaca- tioners arrive in Badenheim, she sees them as "patients in a sanitorium" (p. 3), and she has become obsessed with the notion that the gentile whom her daughter Helena had insisted on marrying is constantly beating her on his</page><page sequence="20">148 DAVID C. JACOBSON estate. This preoccupation with disease and suffering becomes intensified in Trude during the period of the increase of the Sanitation Department's power. As the novel progresses, it becomes clear to the reader that it is Trude who perceives the truth: the Jewish vacationers in Badenheim are all in danger of dying like patients in a sanitorium, and her daughter's love of the gentile man is being repaid by physical abuse, just as the assimilated Central European Jews' love of gentile culture is being repaid by mass murder. It is significant that Trude's hallucinations of disease and suffering cease after Martin goes to register the family with the Sanitation Department. When he returns from the registration, Trude is deeply moved. She looked at him with eyes full of affection, as if he had brought her a mes- sage from a different world. (p. 61) Now that the supposedly healthy everyday world of Badenheim that her husband represents is being invaded by the "different world" of the absurd, Trude is less at odds with her surroundings and need not escape from them into hallucinations. Once this happens, however, she too becomes caught up in the comforting logic of everyday explanations. In the spirit of Pappen- heim's optimisim, she begins to view the impending deportation to Poland as a blessed opportunity to return to her homeland, declaring, "If God wills it, a person returns to the land of his birth" (p. 61). Nevertheless, when Helena eventually returns to Badenheim, the truth of Trude's initial view of reality is unequivocally confirmed. Whatever illusions Helena may have had that her marriage to a gentile could succeed have been shattered. She has in fact suffered at the hands of her gentile husband, and now that the Jews are being registered and isolated from the gentile popula- tion, she has been forced both to undo her decision to marry him and to return to her family. Some characters, however, find it more difficult than Trude does to fall back on the logic of everyday explanations, and so, in despair, they turn the terrible violence of the evil on themselves. A half-Jewish waitress is acutely attuned to the impending violent conflict between the gentile authorities and the Jewish victims, since she is part-gentile and part-Jewish. Unable to cope with the reality of the imminent doom, she gets drunk and stands up in the hotel restaurant, inviting all the guests to feast on the "Austrian meat" (p. 49) of her flesh. She then begins to act out the violence inherent in the</page><page sequence="21">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 149 Department's activities by cutting herself with a knife. With that act she forces the other victims to view the evil of their fate more clearly without the distancing effects of the explanations they have devised. There was an uproar. They ran to fetch Martin. Blood splashed onto the floor. ... The clumsy musicians stood there helplessly. The terror curdled in their eyes. (p. 50) Nevertheless, Pappenheim finds a way to blur the victims' perception of the horror. Just before the waitress wounds herself, she addresses Pappenheim, who responds to the bitter sarcasm of her tone in a light-hearted manner. "Isn't my meat tasty?" She made a beeline for Pappenheim. "Certainly," he said. "So why don't you take this knife and cut yourself a slice?" "Do I look like a butcher?" (p. 49) When, after she wounds herself, the waitress desperately screams that she does not want to be left behind, but wants to join the Jews on the journey to Poland, Pappenheim in a curiously calm way reassures her without display- ing any understanding of the vision of horror which drove her to do what she did: "What did you imagine? Wherever we go you will go too" (p. 50). Another character, a Jew who had been a major in the Austrian army during World War I, commits suicide when he realizes that the registration of the Sanitation Department will destroy his identity as an Austrian patriot and thereby will undermine an important part of his reason for existing. Like the attempted suicide of the half-Jewish waitress, the major's actual suicide reveals the violent reality of their fate to the others living in Baden- heim. Neither self-inflicted violent act, however, serves to overcome the others' resistance to seeing the truth for more than a brief moment. Trude's hallucinations and the suicidal despair of the half-Jewish wait- ress and the major provide visions of the truth of the impending doom that contrast sharply with the commonsense everyday explanations that other characters devise to prevent themselves from perceiving that doom. They also present the reader with symbolic visions of the unleashing of arbitrary evil and destruction that constituted the Holocaust, especially as experi- enced by the assimilated Central European Jews among whom Appelfeld</page><page sequence="22">150 DAVID C. JACOBSON had been raised.22 Such visions provide a clearer view of evil than the por- trayal of the relatively benign activities of the Sanitation Department, there- by keeping the author's technique of representing Nazism by means of the Department from overly distancing the novel from the realities of the Holo- caust. The violent break-up of Helena's marriage to a gentile, the attack of the gentile half of the waitress on her Jewish half, the split in identity forced upon the major that drives him to self-destruction all provide powerful symbolic images of the symbiotic relationship of gentiles and Jews in Cen- tral Europe that was senselessly torn asunder by the Nazis. This truth of the absurd evil brought upon the Jews by the Nazis is also perceived on some level by one of the Jewish vacationers, Karl, when he develops a fascination with an aquarium located in the main hotel of Baden- helm. Like Trude's hallucinations and the suicidal despair of the half-Jewish waitress and the major, Karl's obsession with the aquarium indicates not only his awareness of the absurd, but it also portrays the absurd to the reader in an effective symbolic manner. Karl's interest in the aquarium is aroused when the headwaiter of the hotel restaurant tells him about "the terrible catastrophe that had taken place in the aquarium the year before" (p. 51). Some fish of a new species had been placed in the aquarium; a few days later they unexpectedly attacked the species of fish that had originally been alone in the aquarium "and massacred them horribly" (p. 51), leaving in the aquarium "a floor full of corpses" (p. 51). In contrast to the ways that the Sanitation Department presents its evil deeds to the victims as normal bureaucratic procedures with the purpose of benefiting the victims, the story of the massacre of the fish is a relatively direct portrayal of the invasion of arbitrary evil into the world of the victims. Like Trude's hallucinations and the suicidal despair of the half- Jewish waitress and the major, the story of the two species of fish whose coexistence is destroyed by the attack of one species on the other portrays symbolically the violent breakdown of the relationship between the assimi- lated Jews and the gentiles in Central Europe, which from the point of view of the Jews was so unexpected and inexplicable. In the course of their conversation, Karl and the headwaiter discuss the possibility that one of the species of fish currently in the aquarium might 22. Appelfeld writes of the traumatic experience of his parents' generation of assimilated Jews who were forced by the Holocaust to face the Jewish identity from which they had been fleeing. See Appelfeld, Masot beguf rishon, pp. 9-11.</page><page sequence="23">AHARON APPELFELD AND THE HOLOCAUST 151 again suddenly turn on the other species. Karl suggests to the headwaiter that it might be better to separate the two species of fish to prevent a future massacre. Although Karl does not consciously perceive a direct connection between his fate as a victim and the potential evil fate of one of the species of fish, his suggestion conveys an insight into the nature of Jewish-gentile rela- tions that Appelfeld wishes to convey to the reader. This insight consists of the Zionist conclusion that since the attempts of assimilated European Jewry to engage in a symbiotic relationship with the gentiles have failed, the only viable alternative for the Jews is to separate themselves from the gen- tiles and establish their own cultural and political independence in the Land of Israel. As Appelfeld writes in one essay, the survivor such as himself who chose to emigrate to the Land of Israel rather than continue to live among the gentiles in Europe or other continents, "sought to rehabilitate not only his body [but also his soul]."23 Until the end of the novel, Karl continues to feel a strong connection with the potential fate of the fish, and he becomes obsessively concerned with them. This obsessive concern leads Karl away from the everyday explanations and pursuits that prevent most of the characters from con- fronting evil. Karl becomes so obsessed by the fate of the fish that he is un- able to participate in any of the life of Badenheim. He even makes a futile desperate effort to take the fish along with him in a bottle of water on the final journey away from Badenheim. By the time the Jewish evacuees from Badenheim reach the train that is to take them to their deaths, however, it becomes clear that Karl's desperate attempt to save the fish is as doomed to failure as any attempt by the Jews to save themselves would be at that point. It is the nature of ordinary common sense to seek to interpret reality in terms of the positive benefits it affords people. In his essays and fiction Appelfeld makes clear that this characteristic of human existence was as much reflected in the response of the Holocaust victims to the radical evil of Nazism as it has been reflected in the response of those who live after the war to the historical memory of that evil. Those victims, like Trude at the beginning of the novel, the half-Jewish waitress, the major, and Karl, who did "kill their ordinary common sense" and began to understand the truth of the Holocaust could no longer go on participating in life as they had known it previously, at least as long as they held on to their relatively un- mediated vision of the evil. As Bialik declares in "Gilluy vekhisuy ba- 23. Ibid., p. 18.</page><page sequence="24">152 DAVID C. JACOBSON lashon," playing on the biblical notion that human beings cannot see God and live, "for man shall not see the 'void' [of the absurd] face-to-face and live."'24 Those victims, like Martin, Pappenheim, Samitzky, and Zauberblit, who resorted to the commonsense impulse to find the good and the moral order in their situation demonstrated a powerful human drive to affirm the worthwhileness and meaning of human existence that allowed them to keep on living until finally overwhelmed by the evil of genocide. Appelfeld's readers, the postwar Israeli public, have been faced with a choice similar to that of the victims: submit to the despair that a confronta- tion with the absurd evil of the Holocaust would evoke or chose the path of discovering a commonsense meaning to the events of recent Jewish history. For the most part, Israelis have made the latter choice and have devised an interpretive framework that explains the evil of the Holocaust as a destruc- tive period of Jewish history that was inevitably followed by the revival of the Jewish people in the establishment of the State of Israel. It is difficult to judge those who are faced with the choice of either yield- ing to the natural human urge to believe that there is a meaning to human existence and that the cosmos is essentially beneficent to humanity or kill- ing their ordinary common sense and facing a reality that might destroy them either physically or spiritually. As disturbing as it is to observe the self-delusive characteristic of both the false hopes of the victims and the his- torical explanations of those who live on after the war, it is important to keep in mind Bialik's acceptance of the role of language to suggest that there is meaning to human existence, thereby preserving human sanity and hap- piness. In writing Badenheim, 'ir nofesh Appelfeld aspired to reveal enough of the absurd reality of the Holocaust to keep his readers from fully concealing the truth of their historical past from themselves. In so doing he broke the "covenant of silence" that had emerged between the victims and the sur- vivors on the one hand and those who did not experience the war on the other hand. He established between them instead a convenant of anxiously gazing at the absurd that lies beneath the surface of the meaning we so desperately seek to find in human existence.
