<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yehuda Friedlander. Bemistarei Hasatira: Hebrew Satire in Europe in the Nineteenth Century. Vol 3. Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1994. 232 pp. The third volume of Bemistarei Hasatira: Hebrew Satire in Europe in the Nineteenth Century is Yehuda Friedlander's fourth book dealing with the development of Hebrew satire in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His first work on the subject, Hebrew Satire in Germany (1790-1797), was published in 1979, and three more books have since been published under the title Bemistarei Hasatira. This most recent work, the third volume of the aforementioned series, includes the first two parts of Judah Leib Mises's Qin'at ha-'Emet (1828) and Moshe Leib Lilienblum's satire "Mishnat Elisha ben Avuyah" (1878). In his preface, Friedlander explains that the reason for clustering these works is that Maimonides (in Qin 'at ha-'Emet) and Elisha ben Avuyah (in "Mishnat Elisha ben Avuyah") represent ideas typical of the Hebrew Enlightenment-rationalism and pragmatism. Each of these works is accompanied by a comprehensive and detailed analysis of its content, language, literary structure, and cultural milieu. Friedlander's introductions to these works are a rare eye-opener for contemporary readers who do not have enough familiarity with classical sources to understand the irony and parody embedded in these satires.' Qin'at ha-'Emet is structured as a conversation in heaven between Mai- monides and Rabbi Solomon ben Moses or Chelm, the author of Sefer Mirkevet ha-Mishneh (1751), novellae on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. The purpose of the dialogue is to refute the belief in demons, spirits, sorcery, and 1. Friedlander's introduction to Mises's Qin'at ha-'Emnet was published in English as an independent essay in From Ancient Israel to Modern Judaism: Intellect in Quest of Understanding: Essays in Honor of Marvin Fox, ed.

Mises used Maimonides' halakhic authority and rationalistic mode of argumentation to present Hasidism and the belief in demons and spirits as a movement based on ignorance, led by crooks, and foreign to any halakhic tradition. At the same time he sought to convince his target readers that his vehement attack on the irrational beliefs associated with Hasidism did not stem from or contain any heresy, but rather sought to preserve a pure faith based on a rational halakhic tradition. "Mishnat Elisha ben Avuyah," first published in 'Asefat Hakhamim (1878), expresses the escalating antagonism between Lilienblum and the world of Orthodox Jewry. He used the controversial yet fascinating figure of Aher as a vehicle for his main arguments in favor of positivism, socialism, and pragmatism. The work consists of four sections. It opens with a short introduction in which Lilienblum, claiming to be no more than an editor, explains how Tractate Yishuv 'Olam and its commentary got into his hands. He says that the ghost of his maternal grandfather passed him Elisha ben Avuyah's manuscript while he was participating in a seance. The second segment is a letter purportedly written by Elisha ben Avuyah to a Hebrew author named "the overseer of the good of his people." In it Lilienblum not only exonerates Elisha ben Avuyah from all charges of treason and heresy, but depicts him as the sage who has been chosen to promote Israel's merits before the household of heaven. Ironically (yet so very characteristic of a Maskilic point of view), the text maintains that when Israel's adversaries increased, and Metatron was unable to argue on its behalf, Aher was chosen, because of his mastery of "Greek wisdom," to assist him by writing down Israel's merits. Tractate Yishuv 'Olam and Rabbi Ovadia Bartenura's pseudocommentary make up the third and fourth sections of the book. Lilienblum's didactic purpose is to undermine the Orthodox way of life and propagate the principles of positivism. He argues that nature's useful laws should replace the outdated laws of halakhah. A parodic effect is achieved through the pseudomishnaic format in which this message is delivered. As noted above, the poignant irony and parodies that constitute Lilienblum's main devices in this satire are not easily understood by those who do not share its cultural background. For such readers, however, Friedlander's introduction and hundreds of detailed footnotes reveal, translate, and explain the connotations and references un- derlying these texts. As an example of Friedlander's priceless contribution, I present here an extensive excerpt from the first mishnah of the tractate (pp. 162-163):</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 189 Upon three things the world is based: on Torah, on Avodah, and on the practice of charity; Elisha ben Avuyah said: on the Torah and on Avodah. The reformation of the world is as in its creation: its creation is based on Torah and Avodah, and its reformation is also based on Torah and Avodah. The first part is quoted from Simon the Just in Tractate 'Avot (1:2), and the author of Tractate Yishuv 'Olam sends the reader to the source (Masoret ha-Shass). Elisha ben Avuyah, however, differs from the first part by eliminating the practice of charity, arguing that "the reformation of the world is as in its creation." This statement is a satirical distortion of what is stated in Talmud Yerushalmi, Tractate Ta'anit (1:3). There, the Gemara comments on the verse in Isaiah (45:8), "Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it," saying among other things: "'And let righteousness spring up'-this refers to rain. 'I the Lord have created it'-for this purpose did I create it, for the good order and settlement of the world." The Gemara therefore stresses that the world was created in both righteousness and charity, and this combination was a sort of design for the creation of the world and a formula for its reformation. Now Elisha ben Avuyah comes along and eliminates the principle of charity, basing himself, through astute elision, on that very quotation from the Talmud Yerushalmi. Rabbi Ovadia Bartenura's commentary, appended to these mishnayot, "elu- cidates" Elisha ben Avuyah's intention, and adds: "'On Torah and Avodah.' But not on the practice of charity; we have not found that nature behaves according to the criteria of the practice of charity, as is written: 'the world pursues its natural course' ('Avodah Zarah)." This addition is a not insignificant parodic adjunct, since it breaks down, in an unusually sophisticated way, two major principles in our sage's thought. On the one hand, it negates the belief in God's providence through the creation, and on the other, it abolishes charity as a cardinal principle that characterizes God's providence and Israel's uniqueness.... The double negation of the belief in God's providence over His creation and of the principle of the practice of charity, alluded to in the covert layer of Tractate Yishuv 'Olam, is stated specifically and precisely formulated in Elisha ben Avuyah's letter appended to the tractate: ". .. From now on say: Tractate Yishuv 'Olam is based on the concept that there is no room in the world for compassion and justice, but only for the laws of nature, and there is no belief in Divine Providence and in His involvement after the creation was completed."</page><page sequence="4">190 BOOK REVIEWS This analysis contains many additional footnotes in which Friedlander ex- plains other references to substantiate his arguments and elaborate on the intricacy of the text. The preceding quotation is only a partial example of what it takes to fully understand these writings and enjoy their poignant wit. Without Friedlander's monumental effort, many masterpieces and representative works of Hebrew literature from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries would remain unreach- able for most contemporary readers. Only a scholar of Friedlander's caliber, an established scholar of modem Hebrew and comparative literature, rooted in and profoundly acquainted with rabbinical sources, could have saved these works from being forgotten.2 Yudith Nave Wellesley College Wellesley, Mass. 2.
