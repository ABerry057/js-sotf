<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oliver Leaman. Moses Maimonides. Arabic Thought and Culture. New York: Routledge, Chapman &amp; Hull, 1990. xii, 190 pp. As befits the series in which this book appears, Oliver Leaman believes "it is misleading to think of Maimonides as a specifically Jewish philosopher" (p. ix). That view is the second of the principal reasons why he maintains that Maimonides' philosophy needs to be "re-examined," the first being the popular but misguided search for esoteric teachings in the Guide. In Leaman's opinion, this is part of an "orientalist mode of analysis" which rejects the philosophical significance of Arabic texts. Maimonides, whom Leaman places exclusively within the orbit of Islamic philosophy, is thus portrayed as the victim of "the orientalist obsession with refusing to acknowledge that people in the Islamic world actually say what they mean when they talk and write" (p. 4). The reader who is not immediately deterred by these embarrassing remarks from continuing with the book will be amused by the author's subsequent discomfort in discussing the Guide along purely philosophical lines. Leaman repeatedly (and repetitiously) modifies Maimonides' argument to accom- modate traditional religious views. Usually these are not given as Jewish views, but of course they are specifically, if not exclusively, Jewish. And then there are the particularly Jewish elements of Maimonides' philosophy which Leaman himself is obliged to mention, such as the arguments for the uniqueness of Moses' prophecy (p. 59) and the superiority of Mosaic law (p. 131).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 307 The style of this book is popular and rather unscholarly, with little specific citation of the secondary literature with which Leaman quarrels, and much reliance on translations by others of the primary literature. Leaman mostly refers to his own publications, which include a study of Averroes' philosophy, and builds on this in comparing and contrasting Maimonides with both al-Ghazali and Averroes. In so employing Averroes, Leaman follows a common if anachronistic medieval tradition, one which helped establish the Aristotelian credentials of Maimonides. Leaman concurs with this interpretation, albeit with significant qualifications. Taking Maimonides' assertions at face value, he believes that Maimonides truly accepts the possibility of creation from nothing and the validity of traditional beliefs in divine omniscience, providence, and resurrection. Leaman's atempts to reconcile these views with a philosophically re- spectable Aristotelianism are largely unsuccessful, and, to his credit, he is fully aware of his difficulties. Nevertheless, he steadfastly refuses to consider Maimonides as one who may have held nontraditional and non-Aristotelian perspectives of religion and philosophy. The best thing he can say about Maimonides as a philosopher is that his approach grounds religious belief in rational argument, which argument can do no harm to the faithful, even if wrong in its specific assertions (p. 179). The topics Leaman addresses in this book are indeed central to Maimonides' stature as a philosopher, and are mostly epistemological in content. The applicability of normal language to assertions concerning God is thoroughly discussed, Leaman contrasting Averroes' positive view of equivocation with Maimonides' supposedly negative attitude toward it, rejecting any common meanings to terms applied to God and to His creatures (p. 23). Leaman is forced by the text of the Guide to modify this contrast almost immediately, but he persists in returning to it throughout the book. Accepting Maimonides' affirmations at face value as he does, Leaman's attempts at philosophical argument here and elsewhere frequently beg the question at issue (see pp. 37, 56, 62, 100, 119, 138, 148, 157, 164, 169). In discussing prophecy, Leaman realizes that Maimonides believes that prophetic visions are not meant to be taken literally (p. 51), yet he persists in puzzling over their "objective" validity, ignoring the significance allegory held for Maimonides. Leaman is apparently unaware as well of the circularity involved in his explanation of Mosaic prophecy (p. 62), which he believes</page><page sequence="3">308 BOOK REVIEWS did not need to use Moses' imaginative faculty, since the events at Sinai were supposedly of an empirical and rational sort, though divinely organized. Leaman offers an interesting analysis of the quarrel Maimonides had with the mutakallimun, though he is less aware than Maimonides himself of the futility of the argument, since both deny the other's premises. Leaman may also take Maimonides' view of resurrection too seriously philosophically, since after creation itself Maimonides effectively eliminates the possibility of such a radically unnatural event ever occurring. Interestingly, Leaman does not blink at Maimonides' intellectually bi- ased and elitist view of divine providence, though he argues well for the position-not as uncommon as he may think-that ideal human perfection entails both ethical/social involvement and intellectual contemplation. He does not full appreciate, however, that Maimonides' personal preference is for the ascetic life, rooted no doubt both in personal inclinations and a non-Aristotelian perspective on life. Alfred L.
