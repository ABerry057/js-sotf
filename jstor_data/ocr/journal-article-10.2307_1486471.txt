<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two long-awaited book on antisemitism by Gavin Langmuir "Presently the most erudite historian of antisemitism that I know." -ULon Poliakov, L'envers du destin History, Religion, and Antisemitism Langmuir bravely confronts the problems that arise when historians have to describe and explain religious phenomena, as any historian of antisemitism must. He places unusual emphasis on the role of religious doubts and tensions and the irrationality they can produce. $37.50 Toward a Definition of Antisemitism This collection offers new contribu- tions by Langmuir to the history of antisemitism, together with some that have been published separately. The underlying question that unites the book is: what is antisemitism, where and when did it emerge, and why? $35.00 At bookstores or order toll-free 1-800-822-6657. Visa/MasterCard only.
