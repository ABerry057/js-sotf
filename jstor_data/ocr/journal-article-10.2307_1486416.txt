<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEFIROTAS THE ESSENCE OF GOD IN THE WRITINGS OF DAVID MESSER LEON by HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD I The period from the middle of the fifteenth century to the middle of the sixteenth century marks a transition in Jewish intellectual history in the Italian Renaissance characterized by the decline of Jewish rationalism and the rise of kabbalah.' This process reached its culmination with the printing of Sefer ha-Zohar in 1558-59, an event accompanied by heated controversy on many fronts.2 During these years we find those thinkers who unambig- uously profess their allegiance to one camp or the other, but we also find many whose allegiance is at least superficially ambivalent. Many thinkers in the Italian Renaissance were versed to some degree in both disciplines, and it is therefore difficult to draw a fine line between 1.

That they made use of both sys- tems demonstrates at least that they did not regard the two as mutually exclusive; in fact, many were eager to harmonize them. It is precisely because they attempted to integrate two systems which in later times were diametrically opposed that their writings are easily misunderstood. One such misunderstood thinker is David Messer Leon (ca. 1460- 1535),3 son of the great rabbi of Mantua, Judah Messer Leon.4 David Messer Leon is characterized by modern scholars as "a philosopher who dabbled in kabbalah,"5 a philosopher who knew kabbalah but did not really believe in it,6 "a kabbalist philosopher,"7 and a kabbalist who used his erudition in philosophy to substantiate kabbalist beliefs.8 These characterizations cannot all be correct. The very fact that they are in conflict means that the relationship between kabbalah and philosophy in Messer Leon's thought (and possibly in that of his contemporaries as well) has not been grasped properly, as we shall see below (section II). The con- flict implies as well that we need better criteria by which to understand the relationship between kabbalah and philosophy in the writings of medieval Jews. The best test for distinguishing philosophers from kabbalists, among those who presumed to harmonize the two systems, is one employed by thinkers of this period themselves. It is found in an influential letter of the kabbalist, Isaac Mar Hayyim. In 1490 he wrote to Isaac of Pisa: "... Do not follow those scholars who make reason [muskal] their principle, and who interpret kabbalah in a manner that agrees with philosophy. Rather make kabbalah a principle and try to make reason [sekhel, i.e., human reason] agree with it."9 In other words, Mar Hayyim warns against philo- 3.

The important issue is not simply whether a particular writer incorporates philosophic or kabbalistic teachings or both; rather it is which system is foremost in a writer's works. By this test, David Messer Leon was clearly a philosopher; his treatment of kabbalah was precisely that philosophic reductionism against which Isaac Mar Hayyim saw fit to warn. He made a comprehensive attempt to har- monize religion and philosophy as two complementary disciplines, both necessary for the attainment of the human final end, i.e., devequt with God. In so doing, he found need to incorporate kabbalah'0 and to subordinate it to philosophy. The application of Mar Hayyim's test to every aspect of Messer Leon's writings is, of course, beyond the scope of this article. One aspect, however, is crucial, namely, that of divine attributes, to be discussed below (section III). The philosophic concept of God is crucial to Messer Leon because he bases his attempt to harmonize the two disciplines upon it. God is reason whose essence is identical to His act of existence: "'eem sikhli nimga be- fo'al tamid." I Thus the revelation of God becomes the revelation of reason, and the divine law given to Israel is the law of reason.'2 Accordingly, the dif- ference between philosophy, grounded in human reason, and religion, grounded in divine reason, is but a difference in order and degree. The for- mer participates and resembles, though imperfectly and deficiently, the latter. In other words, religion and philosophy do not necessarily contradict each other; rather they are two complementary systems, two parallel ways toward attainment of one truth. This attempt at harmony is Messer Leon's version of the double truth theory, and it reveals his major philosophic sources, Averroes and Thomas sion from Spain" [Hebrew], in Emmanuel Etkes and Joseph Salmon, eds., Studies in the His- tory of Jewish Society Presented to Professor Jacob Katz on his Seventy-Fifth Birthday (Jerusa- lem, 1980), pp. 64-97. Hacker corrects Nadav's dating of this letter from 1491 to 1490. 10. Messer Leon uses the term "kabbalah" in three different senses: (a) rabbinic tradition as recorded in the Mishnah and Talmud; (b) revealed theology as presented and studied by reli- gious philosophy; and (c) mystical teachings, specifically those of the Spanish school of the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries. This varied usage is not atypical; see, e.g., Simeon ben Zemah Duran, Magen 'avot; Joseph Albo, Sefer ha-'iqqarim; and Abraham Shalom, Neveh shalom. "Kabbalah" is used herein in the third sense only. 11. David Messer Leon, Tehillah le-David (Constantinople, 1576), p. 72b; compare ibid., p. 71a; "'eSem sikhli ba-po'al ha-gamur." 12.

Other fifteenth-century Jewish philosophers who exhibited this combina- tion were Joseph Albo,15 Abraham Shalom, Abraham Bibago, Joseph Ibn Shem Tov, Judah Messer Leon, and Isaac Abravanel. Once Messer Leon's philosophic background is clear, we can see that he meets Mar Hayyim's test of a philosopher: he reinterprets the major kabbalistic doctrine, sefirot, to fit a philosophic framework. (See below, section IV.) Thus, the fact that Messer Leon then defends a kabbalistic term does not make him a kabbalist, since in fact he has invested that term with a philosophic meaning. A historical question now arises: If Messer Leon's allegiance was to philosophy, and if he could subordinate kabbalah to philosophy only through such major contortions, why did he address kabbalah at all? In fact, his father, the philosopher Judah Messer Leon, simply dismissed kabbalah as unworthy of serious study.16 The answer may lie both within Jewish intel- lectual currents of David's time as well as in the general Renaissance milieu of his day. Within Jewish circles, exiles from Spain had begun to spread kabbalah in Italy even before 1492.17 Among them were Isaac Mar Hayyim and Judah Hayyat, who brought with them that attempt to harmonize kabbalah and philosophy found in Spain from the time of Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi, Isaac Ibn Latif, Joseph Ibn Waqar, and Samuel Ibn Motot.'8 By the eve of the fifteenth century, Messer Leon could no longer ignore kabbalah. 13.

Jewish thinkers, some converted to Christianity and some not, supported this movement.'9 By incorporating kabbalah into a systematic Jewish philosophy, Messer Leon could attack those thinkers, and thereby thwart the Christian attempt to eliminate Judaism from kabbalah. Further, Messer Leon's use of kabbalistic terminology reflects an eclectic style characteristic of Renaissance philo- sophers in general, such as Pomponazzi, Marsilio Ficino, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.20 Messer Leon's subordination of kabbalah to philosophy is most evident in his discussion of the sefirot. A controversy raged over their nature: Were they the essence of God (theory of 'aymut), or were they instruments of divine activity, closely attached to God, but still ontologically distinct from God (theory of kelim)?2' Messer Leon defined the sefirot as the essence of God, and defended the theory of 'aSmut against Recanati's view of the sefi- rot as kelim. That Messer Leon appears to defend sefirot at all is the source of the modern misunderstanding of his thought. The controversy over the nature of the sefirot originated in the thirteenth century, at the very beginning of the systematization of Spanish kabbalah. It continued through the fourteenth century in Spain and Italy, mainly through Recanati's book, Ta'amei ha-misvot, and through the fifteenth cen- tury in Italy. Consequently, at the request of David of Tivoli that he analyze major theological issues,22 Messer Leon wrote Magen David, one of his three major works still extant,23 and included therein a discussion of the sefirot. That discussion occupies only ten of the manuscript's 180 folios. 19. See Ruderman, World, pp. 44-56; Isaiah Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, 2 vols.

Even so, they held opposing views on the sefirot, since Alemano defended the theory of kelim. Nonetheless, at least by Mar Hayyim's test, even adherence to one side or the other in the sefirot contro- versy does not per se determine a thinker's status as philosopher or kab- balist. Two modern scholars, Joseph Ben-Shlomo and Efraim Gottlieb, offer conflicting interpretations of Messer Leon's defense of sefirot as 'asmut. Ben-Shlomo, through his study of Moses Cordovero,26 was familiar only with those passages of Magen David which Cordovero copied and used to attack Messer Leon. Ben-Shlomo agreed with Cordovero that Messer Leon was a philosopher and not a kabbalist, despite his defenses of sefirot. To that Ben-Shlomo added three points: first, Messer Leon's concept of the sefirot is another aspect of his concept of divine attributes; second, his concept of divine attributes necessarily follows his position on the problem of univer- sals; third, his concept of universals is "nominalism."27 Gottlieb studied the 24. See Gottlieb, Studies in Kabbalah, pp. 404-11. Messer Leon followed the common medieval practice of interspersing his own comments within sections copied from elsewhere. His treatment of Mar Hayyim was discriminating: while he copied Mar Hayyim's use of the first per'son verbatim, he also corrected Mar Hayyim's citations, i.e., where Mar Hayyim had attributed Sefer ha-peraqim to Plato, Messer Leon corrected it to Galen.

There is confusion in the application of the terms "nominalism," "real- ism," and "conceptualism" to the analysis of divine attributes in medieval Jewish philosophy. Harry A. Wolfson, the major contributor in this field, changed his views and applied the terms differently over the course of time. See Harry A. Wolfson, Repercussions of the Kalam in Jewish Philosophy (Cambridge, Mass., and London, 1979), p. 34, n. 22. Ben-Shlomo followed Wolf- son's earlier definitions in applying the term "nominalism" to Messer Leon's position on uni- versals; by current definitions, the term "conceptualism" would be more appropriate to Ben-Shlomo's analysis. See n. 38 below.</page><page sequence="7">SEFIROT IN DAVID MESSER LEON 415 original manuscript of Magen David and argued that Messer Leon clearly believed that the sefirot exist, even if that existence be only mental, i.e., as thoughts of the divine mind. They are ontologically united with the mind that thinks them. Gottlieb then claimed that Messer Leon was a kabbalist and belonged to a group of kabbalists who in his day debated the same issues, such as Mar Hayyim, Elhanan Saggi Nahor, Judah Hayyat, and Ibn Gabbai.28 The conflict between Ben-Shlomo and Gottlieb can be resolved if one recognizes that it is quite different, on the one hand, for a name to have a reference, and, on the other hand, for the thing named to be in existence.29 In other words, the mode of signification of the sefirot must not be confused with their mode of existence. Ben-Shlomo discusses the mode of signification of the sefirot and comes to the erroneous conclusion that they are names having no reference, and therefore that they do not exist. He cor- rectly recognized Messer Leon as a philosopher who identified the sefirot with divine attributes, but he erred in deeming that position nominalism. Gottlieb, however, discusses the mode of existence of the sefirot and observes correctly that they are not merely nominal, i.e., that they do exist mentally in the divine mind. But from this correct observation he draws the wrong conclusion, namely, that Messer Leon was a kabbalist. Messer Leon was, then, a philosopher, but he did not hold a nominalist position on the problem of universals. In fact, he was a moderate realist, continuing a trend that can be traced to elements of the philosophies of Avicenna, Averroes, Aquinas, and Duns Scotus. It is moderate realism that enabled Messer Leon to incorporate into his philosophy the kabbalistic doc- trine of sefirot, yet neutralize-one might even say expel-their mythical theosophic nature. III Messer Leon fit Mar Hayyim's test of a philosopher by reducing the sefirot to divine attributes, a clearly philosophic doctrine. Only then could he defend the theory of 'asmut, equating sefirot with the essence of God. To 28. Gottlieb, Studies in Kabbalah, pp. 295, 403-25. 29. See Elizabeth Enscomb and Peter Geach, Three Philosophers (Oxford, 1961), p. 91. This distinction is the cornerstone of Aquinas's analysis of divine attributes, which influenced, along with Christian scholastics, such Jewish philosophers as Joseph Albo, Abraham Bibago, and David Messer Leon.</page><page sequence="8">416 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD understand that reduction and equation, we must first turn to Messer Leon's discussion of divine attributes themselves. The focus of Messer Leon's analysis of divine attributes is the attribute "knowing." His major premise is an epistemological maxim: "The knower knows according to the nature of the knower and not according to the nature of the thing known."30 This maxim is fundamentally Thomistic, and Aquinas in fact frequently repeated it, as, for example, in the statement, "For knowledge takes place according as the thing known is in the knower. But the thing known is in the knower according to the mode of the knower. Hence the knowledge of every knower is according to the mode of its own nature."3' The distinction between what is known and the manner in which it is known is crucial to Messer Leon's discussion of divine attributes. The epistemological premise has metaphysical ramifications, because it accounts for the occurrence of human knowledge in general and for our knowledge of God in particular. Messer Leon followed Aristotle in asserting that all knowledge is founded in perceivable objects. He followed Aquinas in argu- ing that from our knowledge of perceivable objects we can prove the exis- tence of God and he in fact incorporated four of Aquinas's Five Ways to Prove God's Existence.32 If God's existence as the cause of all beings can thus be proved, we therefore have positive knowledge that the proposition "God exists" is true. This positive knowledge is significant in the analysis of attributes we employ in religious discourse. Aquinas's influence upon Messer Leon does not overshadow that of Messer Leon's Jewish predecessors. Although presenting himself as a staunch defender of Maimonides against Gersonides, Crescas, Albo, and Abravanel, Messer Leon in fact departs from Maimonides on many accounts, and, without fully admitting it, adopts positions of Maimonides' critics. Messer Leon's version of divine attributes is a modification of Ger- sonides' view, which in turn reflects the influence of both Averroes and the Christian scholastics.33 30.

He weaved the third proof, the so-called "cosmological argument," through his analysis of "necessary being," and frequently repeated the fourth in Magen David. 33. On Gersonides' view of divine attributes, see Alexander Altmann, "The Divine Attri- butes: A Historical Survey," Judaism 15 (1966): 54-56; Harry A. Wolfson, "Maimonides and Gersonides on Divine Attributes as Ambiguous Terms," in Isadore Twersky and George H.</page><page sequence="9">SEFIROT IN DAVID MESSER LEON 417 Messer Leon asserts the propriety of both negative and affirmative pre- dicates of God. He adopts a weaker version of negative attributes, however, than does Maimonides, asserting that the negative terms are only formally negative. They signify a positive reality, that is, God's existence as the cause of the world.34 Therefore what we say about God is necessarily true of Him precisely as the cause of all perceivable things. From our knowledge of crea- tures, we can correctly deduce some knowledge about God, but not vice versa; in other words, we cannot deduce from God any knowledge about creatures. With a negative attribute, we deny of God the imperfection and deficiency which the attribute implies in reference to our mode of existence as created beings, but we do not deny the applicability of the term to God in a manner compatible with God's mode of existence, namely, an infinite, per- fect being whose essence is identical with His act of existence.3 Consequently Messer Leon allows attributes of relation and of action to be affirmatively predicated of God's essence, although he attacks Crescas's view of essential attributes.36 He follows Gersonides in analyzing those affir- mative attributes as analogical terms and exhibits some influence of Aquinas there as well. With Gersonides, Messer Leon asserts that some divine attri- butes are not to be interpreted as pure equivocation, but rather as attributes "bi-qedimah u-ve-'ibur," secundum prius et posterius. He copied from Ger- sonides (without crediting his source) a passage that differentiates between the subject of discourse ("nose be-ma'amar") and the existential subject ("nose bi-me$i'ut").37 God is the subject of discourse of the attributes predi- Williams, eds., Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, 2 vols.

Abravanel made the same identification of Crescas's theory in his Commentary on Moreh nevukhim [Hebrew], 1: 51. Whether or not Messer Leon's characterization of Crescas's theory was accurate, Messer Leon's thought bore greater resemblance to that of Crescas than Messer Leon was ready to admit. 37.

Samuelson, The Wars of the Lord: Treatise Three on God's Knowledge (Toronto, 1977), pp. 210-13. The passage was copied by succeeding Jewish philosophers, e.g., Abraham Shalom and Abraham Bibago.</page><page sequence="10">418 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD cated of Him in human language, and as such He may be said to have many attributes without destroying His unity.38 Messer Leon then accepts the Thomist version of analogical predicates: In regard to what is predicated, the analogical terms signify a perfection in God, but in regard to the manner of predicating, every such predicate bears that deficiency and imperfection of the knowledge of God which we derive from perceivable things resembling God.39 For example, when we apply the term "good" to God, the meaning is not that God is merely the cause of goodness, but rather that what we call "goodness" preexists in God accord- ing to God's mode of existence. In other words, because God is good, He diffuses goodness into things through the creative act.40 Here lies the connection between the problem of divine attributes and the problem of universals that is relevant to an understanding of Messer Leon's theory of 'asmut. Following Aristotle, Messer Leon asserts that the universal, for example, goodness, exists in things, but, following Aquinas, he asserts that it does so because it preexists in God in a manner compatible with God's mode of existence, namely, complete reality.41' We then know the universal through an act of abstraction, such that the universal exists in our mind as a concept. This position is best characterized not as nominalism but as moderate realism,42 which differs from Plato's exaggerated realism, as is explained below. 38. In an article first published in 1916, H. A. Wolfson called such an attribute "nominal" or "invented universal," "Crescas on Divine Attributes," Studies 2: 284. He therefore called Gersonides and Jewish philosophers who followed him, e.g., Albo, "nominalists." Julius Gutt- mann first noticed in 1929 that this characterization was in error, because Wolfson failed to dis- tinguish between theory of predication and theory of universals. See "Levi Ben Gersons Theorie des Begriffs," Festchrift zum 75-jahrigen Bestehen des Jiidisch-Theologischen Seminars, 2 vols. (Breslau, 1929), 2: 131-49; in Hebrew, Dat u-madda', pp. 136-48. Wolfson later clari- fied his definitions, and called Gersonides not a nominalist but a conceptualist; see n. 27 above. So too was Messer Leon not a nominalist. 39. There is a striking similarity between the treatments of divine attributes by Messer Leon and Aquinas. Compare, e.g., Tehillah le-David, 3: 8 with Summa theologica, la, q. 18, art. 3; Tehillah 3: 9 with Summa, la, q. 10, art, 2. Messer Leon frequently expresses the notion of parti- cipation of beings in God's being, e.g., Magen David, fol. 23v: n pmnm In pinnK - nnn n"',zniV 40. Messer Leon here follows Aquinas, e.g., Summa, Ia, q. 13, art. 2. See also Gilson, Christian Philosophy, p. 109; Frederick A. Copelston, Aquinas (London, 1955), pp. 135-36; Enscomb and Geach, Three Philosophers, p. 89. 41. This formulation of the theory of universals is very close to that of Avicenna, who, as Etienne Gilson proved, influenced Aquinas. 42. I suggest this term because it is usually applied to Aquinas's and Scotus's treatment of universals. "Realism" recognizes the debt to Plato, and "moderate" the distinction. See Anton</page><page sequence="11">SEFIROT IN DAVID MESSER LEON 419 To sum up this point: Messer Leon maintains that divine attributes, such as "good," "knowing," "just," "merciful," are analogical predicates prop- erly predicated of God's essence. They signify perfections in God, but they do not introduce multiplicity in God. The divine attributes are ontologically identical with one another and with the divine essence. However, since we derive our concepts about God's essence from its varied representations in finite things, we introduce distinctions where no real distinctions exist. Therefore for us the divine attributes are not synonymous or redundant; rather, their reference is one and the same being: God's essence identical with His existence. While we know that the proposition "God exists" is true, we do not apprehend God's mode of existence. Likewise, while we know that perfections exist in God, their modes of existence elude us as well. Messer Leon's position on divine attributes is very close to Joseph Albo's,43 which also exhibits direct influence of Aquinas. The concept of analogical terms signifying perfections in God is also shared by other Jewish philosophers of the fifteenth century, such as Abraham Bibago, Abraham Shalom, and Isaac Abravanel.44 When Messer Leon defends the theory of 'asmut, he does so as a philosopher. IV Messer Leon identifies attributes of action, analogically predicated of God's essence, with the sefirot.

Albo and Messer Leon agree on the philosophic concept of perfections in God but differ on the appli- cation of that theory to the kabbalistic doctrine of sefirot: Albo identifies 'ein sofwith perfec- tions in God, and distinguishes sefirot as the separate intellects; Messer Leon identifies both with the divine perfections.

And therefore He is said to be the Lord of hosts, since He is the Lord of hosts above and below, i.e., the hosts of the entire world. And 'judgment,' 'justice,' and 'mercy' are in God, because He is their cause, and they proceed from Him. And He is one of them, as we have explained. Now I shall prove that the sefirot are the essence of God from the words of the sages and from the words of the greatest kabbalists in the wonderful Sefer ha-Zohar."47 This passage explicitly identifies the divine attributes, signifying perfec- tions in God, with the sefirot. Messer Leon's interpretation of sefirot follows the same logic introduced in the discussion of divine attributes, i.e., he dis- tinguishes between their mode of signification, "'erekh 'el ha-meqabbelim," and their mode of existence, "'erekh 'el ha-meSi'ut." The mode of signification of the sefirot is that of analogical terms, formed in our religious discourse, the reference of which is one: God's infin- ite, perfect, reality. To illustrate their mode of signification, Messer Leon draws an analogy to the soul and its faculties: to the same extent that we can talk about different faculties of the soul, although in reality there is but one substance, so can we talk about God's different sefirot, though there be but 45.

Plato influenced Messer Leon's philo- sophy, and Platonism experienced a revival generally in fifteenth-century Italy, mainly through Marsilio Ficino's works. Even so, this compliment may be the result of a case of mistaken identity. Messer Leon thought that Plato, and not Ibn Aflah, wrote Sefer ha-tamar; 'Ein ha- qore, fol. 157r. Gershom Scholem, in his critical edition of Sefer ha-tamar (Jerusalem, 1927), notes that it may have been a source of the Zohar; if so, this may account for Messer Leon's mistaken identification.

Messer Leon concludes: "For the sefirot are united in the essence of the Creator, blessed be He, and the multiplicity and diversity signifies [sic] the diverse activities which proceed from the unity of the Creator, not that there is within Him diversity."49 It is this state- ment which is the source of the mistaken notion that Messer Leon was a nominalist. Cordovero copied it verbatim, took it out of context, and erro- neously understood it to mean that the sefirot are only names employed to refer to God's activity in the world.50 Restored to its original context, however, this statement refers only to the mode of signification of the sefirot in human discourse, and not to their mode of existence. Although Cor- dovero (and later Ben-Shlomo) missed this distinction, Messer Leon clearly made it. If there be any doubt that Messer Leon understood and consciously employed this philosophic distinction, such doubt is dispelled by his interpretation of a passage from the Zohar which asserts that the sefirot are the essence of God. There Messer Leon clarifies his view of the mode of existence of the sefirot as well. The passage from 'Idra Zuta, was truncated and translated as follows: "de-'atiqa qaddisha hu meforash ve-'eino mefo- rash, hu metuqqan ve-'eino metuqqan."5' He then asserts that the statement can not be taken literally, for it would be self-contradictory and conse- quently unacceptable. He then equates "meforash" with "mefursam," and 48. As Moshe Idel has noted in "Bein tefisat," Messer Leon drew this analogy from Mena- hem Recanati, Perush ha-tefillot, MS Jewish Theological Seminary of America 1887, fol. 137r. Meir Ibn Gabbai took it from Messer Leon, 'Avodat ha-qodesh (Warsaw, 1883), p. 14b. Cor- dovero used it in Pardes rimmonim; see Ben-Shlomo Mystical Theology, pp. 127-34. 49.

Messer Leon's treatment of this passage of Zohar typifies his philosophic bias. In Isaac Mar Hayyim's second letter to Isaac of Pisa, Messer Leon read the passage both in the original, 7IpnnK K01 7lnnK, and in Mar Hayyim's translation, tuptynirm 7x pn. Messer Leon rejected inter alia Mar Hayyim's use of mitqashet (beautified, bedecked of jewelry), and translated instead metuqqan (perfected, fixed). While both are acceptable, (see Yehuda Liebes, "Sections of the Zohar Lexicon" [Hebrew], Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1976, p. 197), Messer Leon rejected that which agrees more readily with the mythical symbolism found throughout the Zohar. Further, having explicated his own interpretation, he then cites Aristotle's Metaphysics for support, chap. 12.</page><page sequence="14">422 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD interprets the first part: God is known through the knowledge of His activity in the world, but His essence is not known. Messer Leon then ties "metuq- qan" to "qiyyum" (existence), and interprets the second part in the follow- ing manner. Because God is the cause of all existence, we realize, through the activities that proceed from Him, that God exists; however, we do not thereby comprehend God's mode of existence. By this interpretation Messer Leon not only makes the Zohar intelligible by reducing its terms to philo- sophic concepts, he also asserts by implication that the Zohar is limited in its understanding of the mode of existence of the sefirot. To explain the mode of existence of the sefirot, Messer Leon follows a long medieval tradition, from Neoplatonism to Christian and Islamic philo- sophy, which asserts the existence of ideas in the divine mind.52 As stated above, Messer Leon identified such ideas with divine attributes and with the sefirot. Although he credited Plato, he clearly departed from the original Platonic sense of such ideas, and in fact he elsewhere adopted Aristotle's critique of Platonic ideas, and openly disputed Plato's assertion of the exis- tence of ideas outside any intellect."3 Messer Leon employed Aquinas's theory of divine ideas: they are both exemplars (i.e., principle of making) and the objects of God's knowledge (i.e., principle of knowledge).54 He employed Averroes' discussion of perfected forms in God as well." Messer Leon explains the mode of existence of the sefirot as ideas in the divine mind by resorting to a stock vehicle in medieval thought, the analogy of the architect: ". .. God knows the unity of the sefirot in His mind, blessed be He, because they exist in God like the rooms and the attics and all aspects of a house in the mind of an architect. They are there in an abstract and uni- fied manner, but when he starts to build they then become pluralized and multiplied, because they exist outside, in matter, and no longer in the perfec- tion they held in the architect's mind. Thus are the sefirot, which were diver- sified and said to be ten when individual beings became existent. All of them are included in those ten names, according to the diversity of modes of being."56 52. See Harry A.

Through it he summarizes his ontology, theology, and epistemology, and through it we may understand his concept of the sefirot as the essence of God. According to David Messer Leon, God knows His own essence, i.e., the sefirot, by virtue of the identity of His essence and His act of existence. The content of God's self-knowledge is God's infinite perfection, in which all perfections exist under one unified, intelligible order. God's self-knowledge is causative of all other existence, and He knows the particulars of His creation through His self-knowledge. Those particulars share, or participate, in God's being in various degrees, which constitute the hierarchy of beings in the world. Creation then pro- ceeds, through God's knowledge, from God's infinite perfection, to the finite imperfection of each individual created being. Human knowledge of God, by contrast, proceeds from human knowl- edge of perceivable things that resemble God. Through the act of abstrac- tion, the human mind knows the individual essence of that thing which par- ticipates, at least to some degree, in the divine essence. That knowledge is the basis for meaningful religious discourse about God, although in this life it is only a knowledge of God's representation in things and not of God's essence. The problem that the sefirot have a finite number, ten, remains. If they are the essence of God, then is God not limited as well? This of course can not be. (The problem would not have occurred had Messer Leon embraced the theory of kelim, for an infinite being can have a finite number of instru- ments.) To solve the problem, Messer Leon first equates the kabbalist con- cept, 'Ein Sof, with the philosophic First Cause, as had Ibn Waqar and others before him. He then identifies 'Ein Sof with the first sefirah, keter, thereby eliminating the transcendence of 'Ein Sofover the sefirot. Since the sefirot are now ontologically identical with the essence of God, they can be numerically infinite in existence, even though they are limited to ten in human discourse. That finite number is just their mode of signification, a necessary consequence of the finitude of human knowledge. By recognizing this problem and Messer Leon's solution to it, we can see that the kabbalist Mar Hayyim could correctly unmask Messer Leon as a philosopher, because Messer Leon discusses the sefirot not to make manifest God's hid- den life, but rather to solve the ancient philosophic problem of "the one over the many," i.e., the problem of universals. A final example of philosophic reductionism is found in Magen David at</page><page sequence="16">424 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD the conclusion of Messer Leon's defense of the sefirot.57 There he asserts that the universe proceeds from the intelligible order in God's mind (which Messer Leon equates with the Torah)58 and should ultimately return to its origin in God. To explain this ontological process, he employs the metaphor of a cycle, which he then equates with the kabbalistic term teshuvah.59 He drew the metaphor itself, however, from the neoplatonic treatise Liber de causis, probably known to him through Aquinas's commentary. In fact, Messer Leon may have structured his entire discussion of this ontological process as a Jewish counterexample to Aquinas's discussion in De veritate.60 In any event, it is clear that Messer Leon attempted to harmonize philo- sophy and kabbalah by reducing kabbalah to philosophy. V David Messer Leon could assert as a philosopher that the sefirot do exist and that they can be the subject of a meaningful human philosophic dis- course. It is meaningful to discuss their existence only to the extent that it is meaningful to discuss the existence of universals in the divine mind, ontologically united with God. However, it is also clear why Messer Leon could not, and needed not, indulge in detailed kabbalistic symbolism that unravels the dynamic process of divine life and assigns certain characteris- tics to each sefirah. As a result of his contention that God's essence and His act of existence cannot be comprehended by humankind, Messer Leon could not join kabbalists in elaborating on the nature of the sefirot. That is why there are very few passages of kabbalistic symbolism in his writing, and why those few are all copied from other sources. David Messer Leon makes no independent contribution to kabbalah and therefore stands apart from even 57. Magen David, fol. 13r. 58. See my "Tefisat ha-Torah," n. 12. above. 59. The Gerona kabbalists, e.g., R. Ezra and R. Jacob ben Sheshet, interpreted teshuvah as the ontological process of the return of all things to their divine source. See Efraim Gottlieb, The Kabbalah in the Writings of R. Babya Ben Asher Ibn .Halawa [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1970), pp. 61-62, 119-21, 233-37. They founded this interpretation upon the biblical verse, "ve- shavtem 'ish 'el 'abuzzato," Lev. 25:10, and made it the major tenet of their doctrine of she- mittot. R. Ezra cites for support "he-bakham," usually a reference to a non-Jewish source, and oftentimes Aristotle. R. Ezra repeats a neoplatonic concept, "everything came from the first cause and everything then returns to the first cause." Messer Leon then could and did claim that the kabbalistic concept teshuvah was verified by the metaphysicians (ha-filosofim ha- 'elohiyyim). 60. Aquinas, De veritate, I. q. 2, art. 2. Cf. Isaac Abravanel, Mifalot 'Elohim, 7: 4.</page><page sequence="17">SEFIROT IN DAVID MESSER LEON 425 those kabbalists who, along with him, embraced the theory of 'asmut, sefirot as the essence of God. He stands together with other philosophers who treated kabbalistic doctrines within the framework of their philosophy, such as Moses Narboni,61 Abraham Bibago,62 Joseph Albo,63 Abraham Shalom,64 and Isaac Abravanel.65 Messer Leon concurs with Abravanel that the sefirot are the essence of God, and he differs with Albo, Shalom, and Bibago, who identified the sefirot with the separate intelligences. Although Meir Ibn Gabbai, a kabbalist, copied Messer Leon's defense of the sefirot as the essence of God in order to attack Albo,66 a comparison of Messer Leon with Ibn Gabbai would make manifest their sharp and significant differ- ences. In the long history of cross-influence between philosophy and kabbalah, David Messer Leon stands at an important crossroad. His writing is the cul- mination of fifteenth-century Jewish philosophy, which combined Aver- roism and Thomism. Through that combination, he could incorporate kabbalah into his writing and modify it to fit his philosophic framework. Even so, his contemporaries Ibn Gabbai and Solomon Alkabez, whose allegiance to kabbalah is undisputed, could use Messer Leon's philosophy to advance their kabbalistic doctrines. Kabbalah and philosophy are tightly intertwined in medieval Jewish intellectual history, and much work is still required to unravel the threads.
