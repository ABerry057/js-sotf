Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1995. x, 158 pp. Michael Polowetzky's Jerusalem Recovered: Victorian Intellectuals and the Birth of Modern Zionism is a useful book. It collects biographical and historical information about five Victorians who foresaw, and in some cases attempted to effect, the emigration of European Jews to a homeland in Pales- tine. The term "Victorian" in the title refers exclusively to British Victorians; and "intellectuals" encompasses the categories of politician, novelist, scholar, and adventurer. In five discrete chapters, Polowetzky describes the lives and contributions of Lord Ashley (the Seventh Earl of Shaftesbury), Benjamin Disraeli, George Eliot, Charles Warren, and Laurence Oliphant. The book provides only a brief introduction and conclusion (about one page each), so the burden of coherence falls on the emphasis in each account on the relationship of these Gentiles (with the exception of Disraeli) to Jews, Judaism, and the idea of "return." None of these proto-Zionists lived to see the publication of Theodor Herzl's Der Judenstaat in 1895, and only Oliphant, who died in 1886, lived to see the beginning of mass emigration resulting from the Russian pogroms of the 1880s--not the impetus for return imagined by any of these idealists. Anthony Ashley-Cooper was a social reformer who used his influence as a member of one of England's most powerful aristocratic families to advocate social reform. His interest in the Jews was fanatically Evangelical. Here, as in other chapters, biographical generalizations and details are gathered from standard sources, offering little in the way of original interpretation. The strength of this sketch comes from the clear-headed accentuation of the connections between Ashley and important cultural figures, such as Lord Palmerston and Moses Montefiore. When he quotes Ashley directly, "I am forced to argue problematically, financially, commercially . . ." (p. 17), Polowetzky captures the conflict between the Evangelical reformer's personal commitment to the conversion of the Jews and his need to convince British political leaders that a Jewish state would benefit England. Implied in this example are the complicated, even contradictory motivations of these early British advocates of Jewish colonization. Benjamin Disraeli is one of the most interesting figures in Victorian literary and political history. His baptism at the age of twelve ensured not only his entry into politics, but his estrangement from his Jewish inheritance. Following his Grand Tour through "the East," Disraeli merged his romanticism, British</page><page sequence="2">132 BOOK REVIEWS patriotism, and admiration for Judaism to produce a series of novels that imagined the return of Jews to their homeland. In summarizing the plots of Alroy and Tancred, Polowetzky shows the unique combination of orientalist fantasy and liberal-conservative politics in Disraeli's fiction. He describes Disraeli's support for the Jewish Disabilities Bill (passed in 1858) as early as 1847: "Clearly, in the long fight for Jewish political equality, not only in far-off Palestine but in Britain itself, Disraeli played a more visible and active role than any other political figure in the final achievement of this goal" (p. 59). The only woman to whom Polowetzky devotes a chapter is the novelist George Eliot (Marian Evans Lewes). Her singular contributions to pre-Zionist thought emerge in the context of her life: her Evangelical conversion, rejection of religion, and move to London from the Midlands. Polowetzky sees her defiance of convention in openly living with a married man, George Henry Lewes, as directly connected to her interest in Judaism and early Zionism: "Having successfully challenged the oppressive social system once, Marian had no fear in defying it a second time when she advanced the rights of the Jews" (p. 76). Polowetzky discusses her friendship with the orientalist scholar Emanuel Deutsch and the complex of circumstances that led to her writing Daniel Deronda (1876). Literary criticism is not one of Polowetzky's strengths, and his conclusion that "Daniel Deronda may not have been Marian's greatest novel, but it was certainly a worthy memorial to Emanuel Deutsch and an honor to the Zionist movement" (p. 93) is reductive at best. Unfortunately, Polowetzky fails to mention Eliot's most explicit statement in support of Jewish nationalism, "The Modem Hep! Hep! Hep!," an essay appearing in her last book, Impressions of Theophrastus Such (1879). Still, the placement of Eliot's life and work in relation to the other figures he examines is an important aspect of the overall contribution of Jerusalem Recovered. Archaeologist Captain Charles Warren is a particularly interesting addi- tion to this portrait of non-Jewish pre-Zionists, and his story points to the importance of nineteenth-century archaeology as a component of political Zionism. A member of the Royal Engineers, Warren was selected in 1867 by the Palestine Exploration Fund to head an expedition to excavate the still-buried remains of ancient Jerusalem, including the First and Second Temples. Polowetzky points out that the backers of the expedition hoped it would "not only enhance modem scholarship but would also contribute valuable proof for the validity of the Bible" (p. 102). In the course of making</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 133 his remarkable discoveries, Warren came to admire the persecuted Jewish community in Palestine and was persuaded that there was a "natural affinity between the Jews and the people of his own country" (p. 110). He developed a plan for the creation of an independent state for the Jews in Palestine, and published The Land of Promise; or, Turkey ' Guarantee (1875). Laurence Oliphant was another British advocate of a Jewish state who published his views during the 1870s. Oliphant's career is the most bizarre detailed in Jerusalem Recovered. The son of a Scottish colonial administrator, he was born in South Africa, spent years traveling in India, Nepal, Russia, China, Japan. He began a political career as a liberal reformer, then moved to upstate New York to become part of a religious cult called the Brotherhood of the New Life. After eleven years, he returned to England and took up the cause of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Arguing for the economic and political benefits such a state would bring to England, he published accounts of his Palestinian travels in Blackwood's Magazine, thus exposing a wide readership to early Zionist ideas. Oliphant traveled to Eastern Europe to report on the conditions created by the pogroms after 1880. He made repeated unsuccessful pleas to the Turkish government to open Palestine to Jewish immigration before retiring to a European-backed farming community in Palestine. Jerusalem Recovered offers a simple narrative account of its subjects, and escapes oversimplification only in its lack of pretensions. A more theoretical consideration of this topic remains to be written, but Polowetzky seeks merely to "depict how for a period of time, the causes of Jewish political emancipation and Zionism possessed powerful support in the most important sectors of British society" (p. x). His own thesis becomes clear, rather cryptically, in the last sentence of his book: "No longer benefiting from the inspiration of earlier visionaries, contemporary twentieth century Britain would prove to be not the midwife of a newborn Israel as the Victorians had so much hoped, but sadly her opponent" (p. 148). Overall, the absence of academic polemics makes Jerusalem Recovered an accessible book that might serve as background for readers approaching the subject of Zionism's roots from a literary, historical, or political perspective.
