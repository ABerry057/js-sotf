<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shamma Friedman. Tosefta Atiqta:. Pesah Rishon. Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan Univer- sity Press, 2002. 484 pp. All scholarly discussions of the Tosefta begin with the same question: What is the nature of the relationship between the Tosefta and the Mishnah? For centu- ries, the prevalent answer to this question has been that the Tosefta is a supplement to or an early commentary on the Mishnah. Two types of Toseftan material were viewed as supporting this theory: rules in the Tosefta that appear to supplement or gloss specific mishnayot, and material in the Tosefta that parallels, albeit some- times with changes, material in the Mishnah. In Tosefta Atiqta, Shamma Friedman challenges this understanding of the Tosefta through a careful analysis of Mishnah-Tosefta parallels from tractate Pesahim (pisha). As Friedman notes, the prevailing argument that the Tosefta is citing the Mishnah raises two problems: How can a "parallel" be an "expla- nation?" Furthermore, if the redactor of the Tosefta was indeed creating a commentary on the Mishnah, what did he hope to achieve by repeating its words? Friedman argues that we should view these parallel texts as precisely that-parallels rather than citations-and claims that in many cases, the version of a rule found in the Tosefta is, in fact, older than the version found in the Mishnah (11). Though Friedman does not dispute that the Tosefta was redacted after the redaction of the Mishnah, his work challenges scholars to see the relation- ship between the two works as more complex than previously acknowledged. Friedman not only asks us to view the Tosefta as more than a commentary on the Mishnah, he also suggests that the evidence of older halakhot in the Tosefta forces scholars to rethink the nature of the work done by the redactor(s) of the Mishnah and opens up new possibilities for evaluating the evolution of halakhah in the early rabbinic period (93-95). Friedman's book is divided into two parts: an extensive introduction and a careful study of twenty-two Mishnah-Tosefta parallels. The introduction offers a survey of Tosefta scholarship beginning with Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon and continu- ing through the twentieth century. Friedman pays special attention to the work of Y. N. Epstein and Saul Lieberman, whom he regards as the two greatest scholars of rabbinics in their generation and to whom he dedicates his work. Friedman's admiration for Epstein and Lieberman is evident throughout the book, and it poses a not insignificant challenge to his work. Friedman's own conclusions-that the 451</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Tosefta cannot be read merely as a supplement or commentary to the Mishnah and that Toseftan parallels should be viewed as parallels and not "citations of the Mishnah"-put him at odds with his teachers. Although Friedman does not deny this, he does emphasize that, in their work, Epstein and Lieberman sometimes acknowledge that a Toseftan source appears to be older than its parallel in the Mishnah, albeit without pursuing the implications of this acknowledgement. One example of Friedman's analysis of Mishnah-Tosefta parallels illustrates his careful attention to detail and his command of the relevant scholarship. In his discussion of Mishnah Pesahim 2:2 (Tosefta Pisha 1:12, 1:8), Friedman considers the Mishnah's law regarding hamez owned by a Gentile during Passover (156-67). The order of the Mishnah and the Tosefta differ, and there are significant differ- ences in the wording of the parallel halakhot. Working from the assumption that the Tosefta preserves an older version of the law, Friedman argues that the redactor of the Mishnah chose to reorder and rework older sources, first creating a new order and then rewording the sources to create stylistic parallels between now-adjacent cases. In doing so, the Mishnah's redactor created a new legal cat- egory, "hametz belonging to a Gentile over which Passover has passed." This category, Friedman argues, was created to parallel the existing "hametz belonging to a Jew over which Passover has passed," even though the prohibition against hametz held over Passover should not apply to that of a Gentile (156-58). Friedman goes on to explore how such editing by the redactor of the Mishnah influenced later readings of the Mishnah and Toseftan halakhot in the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds. Friedman's work exhibits tremendous breadth in its review of scholarship and meticulous depth in its close reading of texts. If there is one flaw in the book, it is Friedman's extensive focus on certain scholars and his omission of others in an introduction that appears to offer the reader a survey of Tosefta scho- larship. Specifically, Friedman's discussion of contemporary Tosefta scholarship ignores recent work in English, including the work of Jacob Neusner, Judith Hauptman, and Yaakov Elman. Friedman is clearly aware of this work-he cites it in his bibliography-but he chooses not to include it in his introduction. Though some of these scholars support the theories that Friedman challenges, others agree with him that Toseftan halakhot may preserve older versions of the laws than we find in the Tosefta. Friedman's decision not to review this scholar- ship weakens what is otherwise a comprehensive introduction. In a similar vein, Friedman reviews older theories about the redaction of the Mishnah without acknowledging the extent to which such theories have been questioned in recent years. For example, Friedman refers frequently to the assertion, most familiar from the work of Hanokh Albeck, that the redactor of the Mishnah (for Albeck, Rabbi Judah HaNasi) never altered the sources he used to create the Mishnah. Although Friedman's own work challenges this assumption, it would be reasonable to mention that Albeck's theory is no longer widely ascribed to, at least by American scholars. Despite these problems, Friedman's book is an important resource for scholars of rabbinics. His introduction challenges long-held assumptions about the relationship between the Mishnah and the Tosefta and calls on readers to 452</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews reconsider their understanding of the redaction of the Mishnah. His study of individual halakhot in the Mishnah and the Tosefta is in itself an excellent addition to studies of Mishnah-Tosefta and tractate Pesahim.
