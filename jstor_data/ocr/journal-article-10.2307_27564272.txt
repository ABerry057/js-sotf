Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. viii, 215 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000347 In the age-old debate concerning esotericism in The Guide of the Perplexed, the topic of creation has probably attracted more scholarly attention than any other. In this book, Kenneth Seeskin applies the considerable scholarship at his disposal to argue the rather unfashionable conclusion "that Maimonides' convictions are exactly as he states them" (181). Admittedly, those convictions are never over stated, either by Maimonides or Seeskin, but the central contention of the book is that Maimonides nonetheless accepts the view that the world was created ex nihilo and de novo, not because of religious restrictions but "because it rests on a superior philosophic foundation" (3). Seeskin builds his argument on a detailed explication of the two central themes of Maimonides' discussion: first, that we should not accept the Aristotelian arguments for eternity because they do not recognize that "naturalistic expla nations fail when we approach the extremities of existence" (173), whether those are the physical extremities that mle out the Aristotelian arguments from the nature of the world or the metaphysical extremities that mle out the arguments from the nature of God; and second, that the world, with its contingent and (scien tifically) inexplicable features, presents itself to us as the outcome of an act of divine free will rather than a result of natural necessity. The advantage of this approach is that instead of focusing on the nuances, real or imagined, of every element of Maimonides' style and structure, Seeskin forces us, without anachronism and without sacrificing scholarship, to consider the conceptual content of the arguments themselves?to concentrate on Maimo nides the philosopher. This is not to say that Seeskin dismisses the significance of the debate on esotericism; at one point toward the end of the book, he presents a very useful summary of the scholarly positions regarding the Maimonidean prophetology-cosmogony puzzle. But even when he notes the esoteric nature of the Guide, it is never to the detriment of the philosophical analysis. Thus, in objecting to those who seek to dismiss Maimonides' arguments against eternity as dissimulation, he retains his focus on whether the arguments are cogent, noting that "I, for one, fail to see what the fallacy is" (77). 185</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The book begins by outlining the philosophical problems that arise when trying to account for the relationship between the radically transcendent God of monotheism and our corporeal world, recasting the central question of origin as a conceptual question: "Is it reasonable to think that a simple immaterial being possessing free will is responsible for the complex material world we inhabit" (33). This introductory discussion sets the stage for much of what is to come against the background of the thought of the philosophers of antiquity. Thus, in this book, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, and Proclus receive far more attention than Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. In response to the question, Seeskin first rums to Maimonides' reading of Genesis 1 and surveys early rabbinic interpretations of that chapter, which suggest that it does not lend itself to a straightforward reading as creation ex nihilo. That Maimonides interprets it in this manner is attributable to his philoso phical preference, and the rest of the book is devoted to filling in the details of his reasoning and sources. Beginning in Chapter 2 with an examination of Plato's views in the Timaeus and the way Maimonides read them through an Aristotelian and monotheistic prism, Seeskin rums in Chapter 3 to Aristotle's arguments for eternity before a discussion of the Maimonidean critique. Chapter 4 deals with Plotinus's thought and his influence in transforming the philosophical focus from questions about the structure of the universe to questions regarding its origin. With all of this in hand, Seeskin concentrates on Maimonides' positive arguments for creation based on particularization (Chap. 5) before finally treating the related issues of the eternity of the world a parte post, miracles, and the vexed questions surrounding the notion of divine will (Chap. 6). All of this material is presented with rigor and clarity, and the chapter on Plotinus in particular will be useful to students who are less familiar with him than they are with Plato or Aristotle, which is probably the majority, especially among those just beginning their studies. With regard to the thesis of the book, Seeskin convincingly sets out how Maimonides' grounds for doubting Aristotle's demonstrations create a logical space for creation ex nihilo. As Seeskin presents it, Aristotle fails to countenance the possibility of creation, even though it is not a logically absurd position. Due partly to his focus on the structure of the universe rather than its origins, Aristotle's arguments rule out the possibility of something coming from nothing, based on arguments drawn from our physical conception of an already existent universe. But the question of origins is a question of moving from nonexistence to existence, not from one state of existence to another, and thus all of his arguments beg the question. It proves easier to point out the faults in Aristotle's arguments, however, than to formulate positive arguments for creation in convincing fashion. Maimonides appeals to those characteristics of the universe that we cannot explain but that nonetheless must have a purpose if God's decisions are not to be seen as arbitrary. The argument is that we are on philosophically stronger ground if we subscribe to creation de novo because only then do we have a principle of explanation for these features?divine will?the appeal to which, in Seeskin's view, "shifts the burden of proof in Maimonides' favor" (150). Yet the stmggle to strike a balance between the appeal to divine will, the preservation of the 186</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews scientific order of the world, and the restrictions of Maimonides' negative theol ogy makes that a difficult burden to shoulder without even entering the farther reaches of Maimonidean esotericism. First, we have the claim made at Guide 2:48 that speaking of God's willful action is simply shorthand for speaking of the entire causal chain for which he is ultimately responsible as First Cause, which seems to reduce the distinction between volitional and natural explanation. Although the distinction between willing change and changing one's will safe guards divine immutability?Seeskin argues that the appeal to will also allows for the explanation of problematic features of the world without implying any resemblance between "cause" and "effect"?the very ideas of will and choice as genuine explanations of anything inevitably lead us to give them a content, however limited, that might be difficult to reconcile with Maimonides' negative theology. Seeskin readily admits, however, that the arguments for creation ex nihilo leave us, at best, in the position of having "grounds for believing that it occurred even though we cannot say how" (33). Regardless of whether one agrees with Seeskin's conclusions?and to his great credit, a lack of certainty is an explicit theme throughout the book?students and scholars alike will benefit enormously from his presentation, which is as welcome in its philosophical focus as it is impressive. In a scholarly climate that is often focused on the study of Maimonides' esotericism, readers who do take Maimonides at his word on creation now have a suitably sophisticated basis on which to build their case.
