<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Tobias Lachs. Humanism in Talmud and Midrash. Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1993. 150 pp. Samuel Tobias Lachs has written a readable, short tract with the intriguing title Humanism in Talmud and Midrash. The book contains an introduction and four chapters, entitled "Man and Society," "God," "Torah," and "Divine Revelation and Human Authorship." The central thesis of the book is that "humanism" is a systematic part of classical rabbinic literature (as well as clas- sical nonrabbinic Jewish literature) and thought. This thesis, however, depends upon the rather idiosyncratic definition of humanism chosen for the work. Lachs defines humanism by choosing one definition in the dictionary-"any system or mode of thought or action in which human interests predominate" (p. 13). Humanism is, however, understood in academic philosophical and historical circles as much broader than this. Humanism in the modern period is encompassed in such movements and concepts as naturalism, materialism, democracy and civil rights, the scientific method, rationalism, the Freethought and Ethical Cultural movements, etc., in which Jews and Jewish thinkers have played central roles. Little or nothing is said about these other parts of the definition of humanism and their relationship to the ideas found in talmudic and midrashic texts. Lach's book is similar to other recent works which have attempted to examine relevant concepts in the modern period, i.e., human rights, human will, identity, etc., and find precedents for them in the ancient period. The search, while important (since it provides ancient insights into a modern</page><page sequence="2">158 BOOK REVIEWS question), is inevitably limited to imperfect metaphors and comparisons. Besides lacking a comprehensive introduction, Humanism in Talmud and Midrash does not avail itself of the most up-to-date translations and critical editions of the talmudic and midrashic texts. The work also lacks important bibliographical information of recent studies in rabbinic literature, the Phar- isees and Sadducees, Josephus, and Philo which might have given greater breadth to its arguments. Lachs accepts many of the premises set by Jewish philosophy since the time of Moses Mendelssohn and later by Hermann Cohen, with some notable changes. Beginning from the premise that Judaism should be defined as "an ethnicity rather than as a credal religion" (p. 26), it continues the Mendelssohnian vision of the separation of Judaism from Jewishness (without creeds) to define the way Jews must believe or think. This claim is repeated (p. 78) and appears to be part of the book's basic premise. Actually, as Lachs notes, Jewish thinkers in many periods have held that credal statements were crucial to the definition of Judaism (e.g., Philo, Saadia, Rambam, Albo), while in other periods they did not. Other statements in the book are equally distressing; such as "Nowhere is there a passage in which a Jew attempts to prove the existence of God to another Jew" (p. 79). While it is true that the Talmud and Midrash generally contain accounts of Jews attempting to "explain" the existence of the Jewish God to famous non-Jews (Alexander the Great, Tumus Rufus, and Antoninus, for example), it is clear that this was a literary method for presenting (in a nonoffensive way) some basic "proofs" of God's existence for Jews. Often Lachs's book contains polemical statements or diatribes against positions held by modern-day Jewish thinkers or reactionary politicians. These statements are carefully placed in the worlds of the Talmud and Midrash but are clearly intended as critiques of modem society. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Aqaviah ben Mahalelel, for example, are called "individualists and conservatives" (p. 25), despite the fact that these terms are meaningless in the period in which they lived. Another passage reads: "For example, the liberal if not radical interpretations of Rabbi Ishmael and his school stand in sharp contrast to those of Rabbi Aqiba and his school who were generally theocentric and more literal in interpreting scripture" (p. 124). Rabbi Ishmael was essentially a biblical literalist when it came to interpreting scripture. Rather than using the more elaborate metaphors offered by Rabbi Aqiba, Rabbi Ishmael generally insisted upon understanding the Bible at face value. In many ways, Rabbi Ishmael's upbringing and attitude toward</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 159 non-Jews made his overall methodology more "reactionary and conservative" than liberal or radical (if we can use such terminology at all in understanding historical personae). In a time when many scholars in different fields have been rethinking the relationship of "humanistic" assumptions and other stances in Western culture, a book reminding us of the lofty goals promised by humanism is necessary. The present book is a creative and partisan work. It is apparently intended to provide the nonspecialist with a passionate and well-written defense of the importance of anthropocentrism and the role of the individual in modern society, and especially in modern Judaism, using selected citations from the Talmud and Midrash as a springboard to bolster its arguments.
