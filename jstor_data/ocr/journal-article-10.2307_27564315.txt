New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xii, 426 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000761 On June 16, 1942, the New York Times ran an article headlined, "Vilna Mas sacre of Jews Reported: 6,000 Slain in Two Weeks by Police under Nazis, Polish Refuge in Sweden Says." The article, written by Bernard Val?ry, a Times corre spondent in Stockholm, offered a precise description of the mass killing as told by an escaped eyewitness. Despite the sensational story, the news of the Vilna massacre did not make it to the Times front page. It ran on page six. This relegating of news of the Holocaust to the inside pages of the Times is the focus of Laurel Leff's Buried by the Times: the Holocaust and America s Most Important Newspaper. Leff, who teaches journalism at Northeastern University and worked for many years as a reporter and editor, has written a highly readable and scrupulously researched book about an important journalistic failure. Granted, the book has a bit of the flavor of yesterday's news. Deborah Lipstadt's Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933-1945 explored the failures of America's leading papers to report on "one of the centuries most important news stories," and others have drawn attention to the specific shortcomings of the Times. In 1996, Marvin Kalb, the former host of Meet the Press and now a fellow at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, delivered a speech at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in which he condemned the Times for having "failed in its journalistic responsibility during the war": 412</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Not that it [the Times] didn't cover the war?it did, with an exceptional and costly burst of energy and professionalism; it simply did not cover the Holo caust; and to this day, the people who run (or have run) this great newspaper are baffled and embarrassed by this extraordinary omission. Kalb's condemnation may have gone too far. As Leff points out, the Times did, in fact, run more than 1,100 stories about the Jews of Europe between September 1939 and May 1945. Many of these provided remarkably precise information about the atrocities against the Jews. As early as November 1942, an article in the Times named the "special camps at Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor" where "so-called set tlers are mass murdered." As Walter Lacquer long ago demonstrated and as Leff acknowledges, the "punctilious wartime reader of the New York Times would have had a good idea of what was happening to Europe's Jews as it was happening." Leff indicts the Times, then, not for failing to cover the Holocaust but for failing to cover the story adequately. This is the heart of her book: laying bare the insufficiencies of the paper's coverage in painstaking, even exhaustive detail and explaining their causes. That there were serious shortcomings cannot be denied. Of the 1,100 stories that the paper ran on the Jews, only twenty-six made the front page. Many articles that detailed Nazi atrocities neglected to mention that the victims were principally Jewish, or they did so only in passing. Stories that documented astonishing crimes were buried deep inside the paper. The editorial page only rarely drew attention to the plight of the Jews and often adopted stances supportive of, for example, the restrictive immigration policies of the State Department. It is not a happy story and one that ostensibly poses a riddle. Why would the nation's most influential paper, owned and published by a Jewish family, neglect its reportage of the extermination of European Jewry? Leff makes clear that the Times' failure was not simply endemic of the era. Other papers and journals, notably the New York Herald and the New Republic, did a far better job of trying to call the public's attention to the crimes against the Jews. In part, the very prestigiousness of the Times led to a spirit of misplaced caution in the treat ment of stories of mass killing. During the Great War, many of the widely reported stories of the Germans' "Rape of Belgium" were later revealed to be without sub stance, an experience that led reporters and editors to treat stories of Nazi atrocity warily. Leff describes instances in which correspondents at the very same Times bureau expressed incredulity to their editors about the stories reported by their col leagues. Yet as Leff makes clear, the "overly cautious" thesis explains only so much. As the war continued and as the quality of the evidence gathered by the Times became highly reliable and then indisputable, the paper never changed its editorial stance: The news of atrocities against the Jews continued to be banished to the paper's margins. Another factor that contributed to the Times' neglect was "the credibility problem." As psychologists and sociologists have observed, it is one thing to receive information, another to fully process this information and integrate it into one's cognitive framework. To her credit, Leff examines this broad sociological phenomenon as it applies to the specific people who wrote and edited the Times. 413</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Some, such as Balkans correspondent Joseph Levy, actively understood the horror and engaged in clandestine operations to save Jews; others, such as Berlin bureau chief Guido Enderis, were openly sympathetic to the Nazis and prone to dismiss atrocity accounts; still others managed to be fervently anti-Nazi while harboring antisemitic attitudes that led them to downplay stories about Jews. Editors who planned the layout of the paper became accustomed, from the early days of the Nazi regime, to see the persecution of the Jews as an item of secondary importance in the war's unfolding narrative. As the nature ofthat persecution changed from har assment to ghettoization to mass killing to systematic extermination, these stolid newsmen never grasped and adapted to the changing realities. Leff does a fine job of giving flesh and blood to the newsmen who shaped the Times' coverage. But Leff's principal protagonist and target of criticism is the paper's pub lisher, Alfred Hays Sulzberger. Sulzberger, who could trace his American Jewish ancestry back to prerevolutionary days, had a complex relationship to his Judaism. As opposed to influential journalists such as Walter Lippmann, who actively distanced himself from his Jewish roots (Lippmann supported admission quotas for Jews at Harvard and never reported a single item or penned a single word about the extermination of the Jews during the war), Sulzberger remained an active participant in Reformed Jewish causes and organizations. All the same, he was an anti-Zionist and bristled at the suggestion that his coreligionists consti tuted a "people." As a newsman, he was highly sensitive to the antisemitic screeds directed at the "Jew York Times," and he bent over backward to show no reportorial or editorial preference to Jewish causes in his paper. This remorseless evenhanded ness, even timidity, meant that the Times would report on crimes against the Jews, would even report on efforts, such as the rallies held at Madison Square Garden in 1943, to draw national and international attention to these crimes, but it would do nothing to spearhead the efforts to raise the consciousness of the public. Sulzberger, more than any other person, thus defined the tone and scope of the Times' coverage of the Holocaust and bore the responsibility of his paper's woeful shortcomings. But would a more aggressive editorial stance have made any difference? As Leff acknowledges, history by counterfactual is a notoriously imperfect art. Given the prevailing antisemitism in America at the time, it seems fair to conclude that the war effort would have gained little by being cast as a fight to save European Jews. But the question of "what if?" aside, Leff's conclusion? that the Times helped to "drown out the last cry from the abyss"?rings both melo dramatic and true. And as Max Frankel, the former executive editor of the Times has observed, the paper's failure to do justice to the Holocaust "stir[red] the con science of succeeding generations of reporters and editors" to get the story right in Rwanda, Bosnia, and the Sudan.
