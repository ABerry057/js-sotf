<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES by HARVEY E. GOLDBERG Introduction The analytic tools of anthropology originally were fashioned on small- scale tribal groups that possessed no written traditions. After World War II, as anthropologists became involved in the study of complex societies in different "developing areas," the discipline began to relate its findings to the concerns of other fields. Simultaneously, scholars from other social and humanist disciplines, who previously had assumed that anthropologists focused only on "primitives," began to incorporate anthropological meth- ods and concepts into their tool kits. As part of these general trends, there were anthropologists who turned to the study of Jewish society and culture. One natural expression of this trend has been the study of contemporary Jewish communities. There are now dozens of studies of Jewish life from one or another anthropological perspective, most of them dealing mainly with Jews in the United States of Ashkenazi background' or with communities in 1.

GOLDBERG Israel whose origins were in the Middle East.2 A very different trend is found in the analysis of classic texts, notably the Bible but with some atten- tion being given to rabbinic literature, using structuralism and related meth- odologies.3 At first initiated by anthropologists who were not themselves specialists in the biblical period, these approaches have now been adopted by some students of ancient Judaism, who combine them with the more standard methods used in research on biblical and rabbinic texts.4 Anthropology has made less of an impact on Jewish studies inhabiting the broad region between the contemporary and the ancient, that is, on the social history of traditional Jewish communities in medieval times or in the early modern period. This is a situation which has begun to change, particu- larly if we include in this category anthropological studies which have sought to document the recent history of Middle Eastern Jews, many of whom lived in traditional settings until the nineteenth or early twentieth century. The purpose of the present essay thus will be to explore the poten- tial contribution of anthropological methodology to the study of traditional Jewish communities, both "East" and "West." It will try to pinpoint the ways in which tools of research first developed in small-scale, nonliterate, societies can interdigitate with some of the more conventional approaches to Jewish historiography. Characteristics ofAnthropology An inquiry into the possible contributions of anthropology to Jewish studies must begin with a brief examination of the former discipline. It is difficult to present an analytic definition of anthropology which sets it off, with no ambiguity, from neighboring fields. A more productive approach is 2. Shlomo Deshen and Walter P.

This of course entails attention to the obverse, that Jewish studies contain within them directions and challenges that might activate unfulfilled potentials within the anthropological paradigm. The central perspective during anthropology's formative era was that of evolutionism.5 Nineteenth-century scholars examined data from tribal societies around the world and classified them in "sequences," yielding portraits of the development of human society and culture from its begin- nings to the present. This gave way, in the twentieth century, to specific investigations of societies and cultural regions which were less far-sweeping in scope. Within this overall reorientation there appeared, in the early decades of this century, a divergence in the paradigm followed in the United States, under the leadership of Franz Boas, and in the research program developed within British social anthropology. The work of the American school retained, from the evolutionary peri- od, an interest in history, and attempted to view every culture, or culture area, as an outcome of particular historical developments. In the absence of written documents from pre-Columbian North America, anthropologists examined the spatial distribution of cultural and linguistic traits to deter- mine, as far as possible, the growth of cultural forms among neighboring societies within a geographic region. Their research program did not rely only on existing ethnographic accounts, as did that of the nineteenth-centu- ry evolutionists. The questions that they asked took them into the field to gather data, first hand, from members of the societies who had participated in the Amerindian cultures that they were concerned to "salvage" for posterity. Fieldwork also became a hallmark of the new theoretical orientations in Great Britain, and there developed, in that country, a radical break with the historical (or pseudo-historical) theories of the previous century. Parallel to the distinction between diachronic and synchronic analysis which de Saus- sure established as central to the study of language, British anthropologists 5.

GOLDBERG insisted that they could best understand tribal societies by ignoring their past, which in any event was not available because of the lack of written documents, and by focusing, instead, on how they currently functioned. Both in the form of functionalism that was espoused by Malinowski, which was methodologically tied into the logic of fieldwork, and in the expression of structural-functionalism that Radcliffe-Brown took from Durkheim, Bri- tish social anthropology turned its back on historical questions. Instead, the discipline developed methods and concepts for the study of society synchro- nically, as it existed, so to speak, in a "slice of time." It is often stated that American anthropology was primarily interested in "culture," while the British school emphasized "social structure." The Americans, who could no longer observe ongoing American Indian soci- eties, treated social life as emanating from cultural traditions which dictated how they should be organized. Amerindian groups were thus viewed as "having" clans or moieties, in a manner analogous to that in which they "had" a certain bow or a folktale theme. The British, for their part, being able to do fieldwork in colonies in Africa and elsewhere, were able to observe ongoing social life in detail, and saw culture forms as "expressing" aspects of social structure. For example, rituals of ancestor worship were seen as "arising from" a strong patrilineal organization. Cultural forms were not viewed as an outcome of historical contacts with other groups, but were seen as growing out of their social context. In the 1950s there emerged a perspective, partially in reaction to the sociological determinism of the British school, and partially influenced by the American interest in culture, which sought to analytically separate cul- tural systems from the social fields with which they interacted. Cultural systems, it was argued, were both rooted in the past and had to be character- ized by their own properties with the aid of structuralism, symbolic analysis, careful attention to language, and other methods that focus on structures and processes of meaning. Cultures were shown to have their own intricate logics. It is not that cultural processes were unconnected to social reality, but that refined analysis of the symbol systems which constituted culture was required before one could adequately understand how webs of meaning both touched upon and were shaped by patterns of social interaction. This development pushed anthropology into a renewed interest in humanistic approaches, and one began to read of the "deciphering," "trans- lation," or "interpretation" of cultures. One metaphor prominent in this melange has been that of culture as a "text" which must be interpreted in the</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES 5 manner of literary texts.6 This particular metaphor is somewhat paradoxi- cal, for anthropology, historically, has had an anti- (or at least a "non"-) textual bias. Even when investigating communities which were part of civili- zations boasting a "great tradition," anthropologists placed more emphasis on context than on text.7 These new images suggest, therefore, that careful consideration be given to what the application of anthropology implies in connection with societies in which literacy and textual traditions are impor- tant. Traditional Jewish societies, which so heavily invest texts with signifi- cance, provide a helpful vehicle for carrying out such an examination. To illustrate these notions with reference to a specific case, we cite Marcus's study of the pietists (hasidim) of medieval Germany, a study which self-consciously adopts anthropological models in interpreting Jewish society in the Middle Ages.8 Previous work on hasidei Ashkenaz attempted to place the writings of the pietists in an historical framework, seeking to determine their place in the Jewish community or assess the degree of influence from the surrounding Christian society. Marcus's reading of the data available is that they do not permit definite causal historical conclu- sions, so he adopts the stance, justified by reference to anthropology, that he should limit his study to a full and adequate explication of pietist writings, highlighting common themes, distinguishing different strands, and showing links between diverse parts of their religious approach-their interpretations of classic Jewish sources and related rituals. Anthropological sources are cited in showing how the various aspects of a religious culture are inter- twined, yielding an encompassing portrait of a particular religious stance. While the ability to make firm assertions of a causal-historical nature is 6. See, for example, Tom Beidelman's collection of essays in honor of E. E. Evans-Prit- chard, The Translation of Culture (London, 1971); Clifford Geertz's collected essays focusing on theory, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 1973); or Mary Douglas's paper "Deciphering a Meal," in Implicit Meaning: Essays in Anthropology (London, 1975), pp. 249-275. The textual metaphor is found, among other places, in James Boon, From Symbolism to Structuralism: Levi-Strauss in a Literary Tradition (Oxford, 1972) and Geertz, op. cit. 7. Redfield has distinguished between "little traditions," religious cultures growing out of the situation of local communities where literacy was limited, and the various "great tradi- tions" (Islam, Hinduism, etc.), whose bearers are a transregional literate religious elite. He sought to formulate research problems concerning the impact of great traditions on local communities.

GOLDBERG limited, the study succeeds in conveying a persuasive portrait of what pi- etism in the Rhineland of the Middle Ages was about. Marcus's study contains a brief reference to a fascinating custom which ties in with the general theme of the centrality of texts in Jewish culture. This is the custom, carried out on Shavu'ot, the festival marking the receipt of the Torah, of having young male children, in the presence of the rabbi, lick honey from a slate upon which the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were writ- ten and eat cakes in the forms of the letters.9 One pietist opinion was that this practice should be banned, because the cake-letters would eventually be turned into feces, while a later opinion permitted it, apparently in response to the tenacity of the custom within the community. In the terms we have presented above, Marcus's study adopts a synchro- nic perspective, seeking to give a portrait of the internal structure of the pietists' religious system. The emphasis is on the cultural level, with some attention given to a depiction of social structure, including attempts to see how cultural and social levels are connected. The approach, in its synchro- nic mode, eschews the question of the degree to which Jewish pietism was influenced by Christian pietism, even though other researchers have suggest- ed that this was a crucial historical factor. Similarly, reference is made to a local folk custom, the type of practice which often is rooted in a wider cul- tural milieu, but no suggestion is made as to whether it reflects a trait common to neighboring groups or is expressive of the social structure of Jewish society. While the practice is not based on any well-established bibli- cal or rabbinical rule, its close linkage to important values in rabbinic tradi- tion highlights the problematics of the interpenetration of folk traditions and great traditions, and points to a potential application of anthropolog- ical insights concerning ritual to popular Jewish practice. The example cited above thus points to a number of methodological issues which anthropologists have faced in their work with tribal and tradi- tional societies. Anthropological research, as it has been carried out until now, has little to offer with regard to the question as to whether one set of texts produced by a religious elite may be related to a different set of texts. It takes for granted, however, that folk customs and everyday behavior are to be assessed in a regional context. Moreover, it assumes that there exist func- 9.

These issues will now be explored in greater depth, while referring to research into traditional Jewish societies conducted from anthropological perspectives. The issues to be dealt with are (1) the influence of the wider non-Jewish environment, (2) viewing customary prac- tice as an expression of social structure, and (3) incorporating a textual per- spective as part of an anthropological approach to the understanding of Jewish society and culture. The discussion will conclude by considering the value of another anthropological principle, that of comparative research, for Jewish studies. Influence of the Environment It is rare, for the Middle Ages, to have extensive data of so detailed a nature as would allow an assessment of how a given custom was distributed within and among different groups of a geographic region. We can explore the complexities of this question, however, by reference to Ashkenazi culture at a much later stage. We refer here to the work of the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry, which documented dialect patterns and culture trait distributions among Yiddish speakers as they existed in the early part of this century.'0 This project, in addition to recording in detail many aspects of tradition- al culture in the Yiddish-speaking world, sought to understand the dyna- mics of "bilingual dialectology," the impact of neighboring languages upon one another. It systematically compared parallel linguistic features of a Jewish language (Yiddish) and the non-Jewish languages (e.g., Polish, Rus- sian) which coexisted with Yiddish in the same area. The mapping of paral- lel linguistic features within the same region showed clearly the expected influence of the coterritorial languages on Yiddish dialects. At the same time, the data indicated that the Jewish language was not simply a "sponge" which mechanically absorbed influences from the environment. The spatial 10.

GOLDBERG distribution of linguistic features in Yiddish was not identical to that ex- hibited by the non-Jewish languages, a fact that reflected migrations and lines of communication internal to Jewish society, resulting in linguistic influence that was partially autonomous of the wider environment." The same type of analysis with regard to the distribution of cultural traits (e.g., traditional practices) also raises some interesting questions. A well-known non-Jewish custom in parts of Poland is the preparation of colored eggs on Easter. The data of the Yiddish Atlas indicate that there were places in which Jews prepared colored eggs on Passover, which were exchanged during visits between families. Even more intriguing, however, is the fact that in some places Jews practiced this custom, not on Passover, but on Lag Ba'omer.'2 One cannot go back into history and prove the motiva- tions behind these developments, but, following Levi-Strauss, anthropolo- gists widely assume that such phenomena reflect the working out of a system of markers of cultural difference.'3 Proximity between two groups is, on the one hand, a cause of similarity between them, but on the other, may be the basis of the underlining of cultural distinction. The work on the Yiddish Atlas shows the powerful influence of the environment on Jewish culture, but also the integrity of Jewish life as a working system in its own right. It thus requires a sensitive sociohistorical touch to be able to take into account wider non-Jewish cultural influences while simultaneously appreciating the internal threads which hold Jewish society together. In order to handle the subtleties involved in such a chal- lenge, it is important to separate, analytically, cultural from social pro- cesses. In the example cited above, we could point to the fact of social con- tact between Jews and other Eastern Europeans, but this does not determine whether the result of such contact will be cultural borrowing or the elabora- tion of emblems of separateness. Before discussing this issue in greater depth, further mention will be made of the development of lines of anthro- pological thought on the matter. Custom and the Internal Structuring of Communities The turn away from evolutionism, discussed above, led anthropologists 11. Herzog, Yiddish Language, pp. 252-255. 12. Ibid., pp. 38-39. 13. Claude Levi-Strauss, Race and History (Paris, 1958), pp. 10-12.</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES 9 to focus on one local unit at a time, variously defined as a "society" or as a "culture." This approach could be maintained so long as anthropologists were dealing (or thought they were dealing) with relatively isolated groups. It allowed anthropologists to show the institutional overlapping and symbo- lic linkages which tied communities of people together. For more than a generation, however, anthropology has criticized this model in its simplistic form. It has come to realize that there are no truly isolated societies, but that all of the single communities anthropologists studied were affected by wider economic, political, and cultural realities.'4 This did not make the study of individual communities meaningless, but forced anthropologists to focus more carefully on the applicability of their concepts. The distinction be- tween social and cultural aspects of communal life proved useful in this regard. This distinction, between interactional and institutional patterns, on the one hand, and symbolic or cultural processes on the other, does not seek simply to separate and catalogue these differing levels of action, but to explore their intricate, and sometimes contradictory, modes of inter- penetration. Any given community might form part of a wider economic network, or be integrated into a broader political entity, but the members of that com- munity could still continue to view themselves, in some aspects of their social lives, as distinct. The communities traditionally studied by anthropo- logists often were small in scale and their members were intertwined with one another in many-stranded relationships. The stability of these relation- ships (links to the wider society notwithstanding), and of the general societal and cultural frameworks within which they functioned, encouraged the development and elaboration of multilayered symbolic systems built upon shared and implicit meanings. Moreover, systems of symbols had the ability of creating distinct cultural universes, even though the participants in those worlds of meaning might, on a concrete interactional level, be engaged with individuals and groups attached to very different cultural worlds. Thus, ana- lytically separating the cultural from the social aspects of communal life permits one to explore how groups can be very much part of a broader social reality while forging distinctive self-definitions, world-views, and rules for behavior. The above characterization of communities typically studied by anthro- pologists in the field could broadly be applied to social life in earlier times 14. Eric Wolf, Europe and the People Without History (Berkeley, 1982).</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVEY E. GOLDBERG during which there was primary reliance on community-wide, face-to-face, taken-for-granted communication. It is not necessary to have observational data that one has collected on his own in order to approach a society with the eyes of a fieldworker. At a basic methodological level, fieldwork leads a researcher to take into account the way different spheres of social and cul- tural life intersect, for example, how social stratification may be reflected in religion, or how a customary practice may carry political overtones. An- thropological theorizing has moved beyond the notions embodied in clich6s such as "holism," suggesting that "everything is connected to everything," but remains sensitive to the complex and contradictory ways in which aspects of social life and cultural life may be interwoven in daily life. A social perspective in Jewish history, of course, is not new. Through the study of communal ordinances and responsa, historians have given us por- traits of institutional life, anchored in economic realia and reacting to wider political frameworks. Less attention has been paid to the more "informal" sides of social intercourse, such as family functioning, casual contacts be- tween Jews and non-Jews, or popular religious customs. These spheres of everyday behavior, to which the anthropologist is particularly attuned, often become infused with delicate symbolic accretions which appear, at first, to be "curious" or "quaint" but which may be linked, in multiple ways, to the more "serious" structures of a society. An example of these processes may be found in the Mimuna festival among the Jews of Morocco."5 Celebrated on the night which terminates the Passover holiday, this popular fate clearly resembles other springtime festi- vals described for the Mediterranean area from antiquity through the pres- ent. The direct influence of the environment is manifest, while structural analysis reveals masked links between the Mimuna and a Muslim celebra- tion, called Sultan et-Tolba, that takes place at approximately the same period of time. Moroccan Jews, however, work to interpret the celebration in terms of Jewish tradition. They link the patently North African term mimuna with the Hebrew word for "faith," emuna. The Mimuna, however, is not only a trait absorbed from the larger society, but takes on significance at several levels. One of these concerns ties 15. Harvey E. Goldberg, "The Mimuna and the Minority Status of Moroccan Jews," Ethnology 18 (1978): 121-133.</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES 11 among families within the community, for the Mimuna is a reversal of the formality which characterizes intra- and inter-family relations on the first night of Passover. Secondly it is a statement about the linkages between Jews and the non-Jewish world, and even entails an involvement of Muslims in Jewish ritual life. It may be seen as an attempt to make those ambivalent links smooth at a season, structured by the Jewish liturgical calendar, when they are potentially fraught with tension. The Mimuna thus carries mean- ings relevant to family life, communal solidarity, and relations with non- Jews, and is finely balanced between the forces of popular religion, Jewish tradition, and local Gentile influence. Sociologically, it clearly reflects the overall reality of the Jews as a weak minority under Muslim rule, and complements the view of Moroccan society carried out with the aid of more conventional approaches to Jewish historiography.'6 The analysis of the Mimuna outlined above is based on observations made in contemporary Israel, information gathered from informants who described life in Morocco, and a reading of historical documents with an anthropological eye. The kinds of questions anthropologists ask, however, are no longer confined to that discipline, and appear, for example, in works on cultural history, or in the study of what the French call mentalitis. More could be done in this area if existing material on "customs" or "folkways" were examined through an anthropological lens. An example is provided by Horowitz's study of confraternal processions among Italian Jewish com- munities in the Veneto in the early modern period." Processions, as part of the funeral of a known rabbi, or accompanying a Torah scroll being donated to a synagogue, are documented in detail for communities such as Venice, Verona, and Padua. Various tensions accom- panied these processions, perhaps the most basic being the concern that they obviously reflected the influence of the Catholic environment. Once the principle of the processions was accepted, however, a close reading of the details of their performance reveals various facets of communal organiza- tion and attendant conflicts. Horowitz shows how an examination of these 16. Shlomo Deshen, The Mellah Society: Jewish Community Life in Sherifian Morocco (Chicago, 1989). 17. Elliot Horowitz, "Confraternal Processions and Social Tensions in the Jewish Com- munities of the Veneto" (Paper presented at a conference on Jewish Societies in Transition in the 16th-17th Centuries, Van Leer Institute, Jerusalem, January 1986, and forthcoming as a chapter in Jewish Confraternal Piety in Early Modern Italy).</page><page sequence="12">12 HARVEY E. GOLDBERG events throws light on the competition among various confraternities, the relative importance of the confraternities vis-a-vis the broader community council, and the changing place of the yeshiva in relation to the community. In his words: "The groups participating in the funeral procession often saw in it an opportunity to express their perceived relationship, not only with the deceased, but also with each other." Both of the above examples, one taken from Italy (in which there were both Ashkenazi and local Italian traditions), and the other from North Afri- ca, show the influence of the environment, on the one hand, and the rework- ing of these influences, in terms of the internal structure of the Jewish com- munity, on the other. Indeed, in Horowitz's study, he indicates how the non-Jewish source of influence was, at a certain point, a matter of explicit concern and debate. In general, the dynamic aspect of such a situation must be appreciated. The very absorption of influence from the wider society, a ubiquitous phenomenon in Jewish history, itself stimulates countervailing processes which seek to oppose, insulate, mask, reinterpret, or in some fashion or another judaize the external borrowings. The Cairo genizah materials from the Middle Ages provide many exam- ples of Muslim influence on Jewish practice, coupled with attempts to resist that influence. For example, Goitein discusses how Muslim law recognizes a formal status between a freed slave and his (her) former owner, the latter being known as the mawla of the former. Jewish law concerning freed slaves recognizes no such continuing official status, but Jewish practice was clearly influenced by the prevailing Muslim norms. "In a court record from Fustat, dated June 28, 1080," Goitein writes, "the freedman Mubarak (who had become a successful businessman) was first characterized as the mawla of Joseph b. Joshiah, a person known from other documents, then the Arabic term was deleted and replaced by the Hebrew 'freed by'."'" The replace- ment of a Judeo-Arabic word by a word in Hebrew in a contract between individuals is one example of the pervasiveness of such "countervailing" processes. Goitein's penetrating portrayal of medieval "Mediterranean society," with the aid of documents from the genizah, is also an example of the use of 18. S. D. Goitein, A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza, vol. 1, Economic Foundations (Berkeley, 1967), p. '46.</page><page sequence="13">ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES 13 an anthropological perspective in the writing of Jewish history. Goitein utili- zes the neologism "sociography" to describe his work.19 His beguilingly straightforward narrative style hides an explicit method which attempts to let the people and documents of the genizah "speak for themselves,"20 a point of view reflecting recent debates as to the nature of anthropological work. Text in Society Goitein's claim that his purpose is to let members of "genizah society" speak for themselves notwithstanding, he adroitly weaves powerful generali- zations into his writings. In his volume on the family, he ventures the view that genizah society, despite its openness and similarity to modern society in many regards, remained medieval in its character because women were not routinely included in the elementary educational institutions which inculcated basic skills of literacy.21 This summary statement suggests a division of social life, in traditional societies, into spheres where the ability to read and write is central, and others which are based on interpersonal communication unmediated by the written word. One can see a correlation between the former category and the world of men, in contrast with the latter linked to the world of women. Recently, however, in a study of Ashkenazi women in early modern times, it has been shown that this is too facile a formulation.22 Still, it is possible to characterize traditional Jewish societies, as we did above, as based on shared understandings supported by face-to-face communication which was main- tained even when rates of literacy were low. The question of which sectors of the population participated in literary-based culture, and to what degree, should remain open for empirical investigation. Traditional Jewish com- munities, as indicated, fit into the common medieval pattern, but it seems also to be the case that both reference and access to the community's sacred 19.

GOLDBERG texts, among different strata of society, were more extensive and intensive than was common in the wider Christian or Muslim milieus. One set of questions growing out of this situation concerns the for- malized and informal social mechanisms whereby the contents of texts were transmitted and made relevant to daily life. With regard to this question, it is striking how similar the structure of basic Jewish education was through- out the premodern Jewish world, whether in Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.23 Another set of questions relates to the dynamics linking sym- bolic systems growing out of the rhythm and "logic" of social life at a given time and place with those based on revered texts formed in the past. This issue may be illustrated by further discussion of North African case ma- terial. One sphere of social behavior and cultural meaning which is universally encoded with many levels of significance is the realm of food preparation and consumption. Food-related activities are basic in all societies, and carry complex symbolic loads even when the group in question does not possess a literary tradition.24 It is instructive, therefore, to examine how symbols anchored in the life of the kitchen link up with religious ideas regnant in other central life spheres. Such an examination must keep in mind that meanings associated with food (or any other semiotic system) are poorly understood when simply viewed as part of a "dictionary," in which each food custom is listed and its meaning attached. Rather, individual symbols make fullest sense when placed in the context of a series of interrelated signi- fications.25 In Bourdieu's study of Kabyle (Berber) society in Algeria, he analyzes the cooking cycle, showing that the implications associated with different foods and their modes of preparation are part of an annual repetitive pat- tern based on the agricultural year and the contrast between male and female, both of which are linked to basic notions of the cycle linking fecun- dation, death,and resurrection (and back again). The codes of cooking and of other women's activities are subordinated to the dominant reality of the 23. Harvey E.

These symbolic systems, however, can be analyzed with little reference to Islam, except that Bourdieu points out how the daily cycle of agrarian and domestic activities meshes with the times of the call to prayer.26 In partial contrast, and still referring to the North African context, Bahloul has provided a study of the semiotics of food among Algerian Jews.27 She shows, for example, the linkages between the Jewish calendar, the textually based framework which sets the basic parameters within which Jewish ritual life is carried out, and activities in the kitchen. In these link- ages, references to textual-based material frequently come up, even though individual women working in the kitchen may not be learned or even liter- ate, and some of the food customs among the Jews, reflecting local ecology and conceptions of the agricultural cycle, originally may have been bor- rowed from non-Jewish neighbors. When such customs develop, Jewish tradition does not "leave them alone," but tends to judaize them by linking them with a traditional verse, phrase, or even a word. If we may paraphrase Derrida's statement that "there is nothing outside the text,"28 anthropologi- cal data on Jewish communities show that there is nothing that "the text" ignores. This can be seen by citing another custom in its North African Jewish version while relating it both to its textual base and its expression in other Jewish settings. Udovitch and Valensi describe how the Jews of Jerba, in southern Tuni- sia, utilize a form of wordplay on Rosh ha-Shanah with regard to the fruits and vegetables that adorn the festive holiday table.29 Utilizing homonyms and homophones, associations are created between these foods and qualities of the coming New Year that members of the family, and community at large, wish to invoke.

GOLDBERG explained, evokes the Hebrew stem meaning "growth," and the local term for "squash" connotes Hebrew "tear apart," with the implication that the consequences of past sins should be destroyed. This practice, taking place at one of the central moments of the ritual year, signals an intricate symbiosis between universal Jewish tradition and the specific reality in which Jews find themselves, as expressed in the vernacular and the produce of the market. This custom, however, represents more than a regional North African trait, for it carries with it the weight of rabbinic tradition. Its prototype is outlined in the Talmud,30 where the vernacular is Aramaic, and was encoded by Yosef Caro, a sixteenth-century Sephardi rabbi living in the Ottoman Empire, in what became the authoritative Shulhan 'A rukh.3' The practice, in fact, entered standard Sephardi ritual, even though the spoken Judeo- Spanish of the Sephardic communities was quite remote from the Aramaic on which the custom is based. The way the practice concretely presents itself in different communities, however, shows an interesting variety of the inter- weaving of text, language, and custom. In some North African communities, such as Algeria, the custom is spelled out in the New Year mahzor, and there the resemblance between some of the current Arabic food terms and the original Aramaic comes into view. In other communities, including Jerba, many versions of the mahzor do not mention the practice, so that its immediate impact is that of a tradi- tion carried within the living community which resonates closely with the contemporary spoken language. I recently visited the home of a Jewish fami- ly from Tripoli, Libya, now residing in Rome, and began to thumb through a New Year mahzor on one of the bookshelves. It was a copy of an edition published in Leghorn, and was similar to the Algerian book mentioned above. Turning to the page describing the customs for the Rosh ha-Shanah night table, I found a piece of paper that listed, in Italian, the foods to be prepared in accordance with the ritual. The woman of the house had had no formal Jewish schooling, and the food customs she had learned in her native Tripoli were probably generally similar, while differing in some details, to those appearing in the book (which she could not read). Being literate in Italian, she made the list in order to be able to preserve the custom of her original North African home, where the first language of most Jews 30. B.T. Keritut 6a. 31.

The seemingly casual presence of this piece of paper attest- ed to the importance which the practice still retains. In addition, the power of the overall pan-Jewish written tradition is indi- cated by the fact that Rosh ha-Shanah food wordplay was also found in Yiddish-speaking regions, although researchers focusing on that area also seem to have overlooked the textual side of this language-linked custom.32 Moreover, one of the leaders of Orthodoxy in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Ha-Cohen, in a gloss on the above-cited sec- tion of the Shulhan 'Arukh in his Mishnah Berurah,33 explicitly states that this practice should be extended to every land, and adjusted to the local lan- guage. It is far from our intention to claim that every detail of local behavior on the part of traditional Jewish communities was anchored in a proof-text, but the Rosh ha-Shanah table example should alert us to cultural mechan- isms which link together textually based and popular culture. Thus, at a pivotal moment in the Jewish ritual year, Jewish traditions, as embodied in Hebrew words (which over the centuries were valorized pri- marily in their written rather than spoken forms), expands to impose its own interpretations upon the non-Jewish setting to which it normally must accommodate itself. Albeit a moment of relaxation and perhaps mild levity on one of the year's most solemn days (or perhaps precisely because it appears in the form of "play"), this custom, and others which parallel it, shows the ability of the tradition of a minority, linked to the language and books which are shared with Jews everywhere, to transform the external to one's own, the Arabic to Hebrew, the realia of daily existence to a gloss on a hallowed text. The examples cited above have shown the penetration of textual culture into the world of the kitchen and cuisine, realms often thought of in terms of casual, nonliterate, cultural transmission, "from mother to daughter." Conversely, to the extent that males were perceived as the arbiters of the written tradition, it meant that they had to pay some attention to this other- 32. Herzog, Yiddish Language, pp. 32-33, 48n., documents a custom of this genre among Yiddish speakers of northern Poland involving the preparation of sweet carrots (= mern, which also means "to multiply"). He notes the absence of a parallel custom among the coterritorial non-Jewish population, but his discussion ignores the basis of the custom in the "great tradi- tion," as do the references to the same practice in Max Weinreich, History of the Yiddish Lan- guage, trans.

This linkage between diverse domains, the "scholar- ly" and the "domestic," falls into place with the commonly made contrast between popular custom and rabbinic rules, and the observation that often when rabbis opposed a widespread practice, but could not eradicate it, they refashioned the popular rite by interpreting it in terms of authoritative texts. A recent study by Horowitz has documented a transformation of this sort with regard to the performance of precircumcision vigils, while also showing how the process entailed a shift in the roles of men and women within those celebrations.34 First mentioned as early as the thirteenth century, these events involved singing, storytelling, gambling, and in some instances dancing, along with the liberal consumption of food and drink. Though linked to the biblically prescribed circumcision ritual, they themselves had little formal religious content but reflected a common medieval atmosphere in which "the domains of the sacred and the profane defied neat separation." During the seventeenth century, the vigils became more reserved and more sacred. Communal sumptuary ordinances toned down the lavish consumption, and rabbinical decrees introduced the reading of appropriate selections from revered texts, including the Zohar. These developments involved removing women from a prominent place in the valued phases of the festivities, where they previously had been central, and had intermingled casually with men. Horowitz documents these shifts in Italy and in Central Europe, while plac- ing them in the context of changing religious sensibilities in the wider society, both among Protestants and Catholics. It is, of course, characteris- tic of the Jewish case that the reading and "study" of texts on the part of the participants were the means by which such fetes were moved into the orbit of activities carrying rabbinic sanction. While in the regions which form the focus of Horowitz's research the popular names given to these vigils were Veglia and Wachnacht, in Tripolitania they bore the appellation of the text associated with the occasion: Lilet ez-Zuhar ("the night of the Zohar"). Comparative Perspectives The last example, as well as others we have discussed, underlines the fact that even the most intimate processes of Jewish society must be seen in 34. Elliot Horowitz, "The Eve of Circumcision: A Chapter in the History of Jewish Night- life," Journal of Social History, in press.</page><page sequence="19">ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF TRADITIONAL JEWISH SOCIETIES 19 their wider context. This implies a comparative outlook, which has always been one of the hallmarks of the anthropological perspective, even though a variety of approaches and methods have been utilized in carrying out comparative research. This section constitutes a plea for comparative inves- tigations of Jewish society and culture, by citing several studies which point in that direction. The first involves the study of the non-Jewish setting in which Jews live. Here, too, the analytic distinction between the social and the cultural orders, as well as the distinction between the aspects of a cultural world which are expressive of local conditions as compared to those stemming from a "great tradition," must be kept in mind. Bartoszewski has carried out research on Jewish-Gentile relationships in rural Poland, investigating the social ties that obtained between the Polish peasants and the Jews in the countryside before World War II.35 His data are taken from field interviews concerning that period, and he has analyzed popular images of Jews as expressed in various folklore genres. He finds that stereotypes concerning Jews were, in many respects, similar to stereotypes of other foreign ethnic groups, and that mythic images of Jews often reflected their position as mediators or middlemen. These stereotypes of Jews, arising out of the organization and logic of peasant economic life, were distinct from stereotypes and images related to formal Christian traditions. Bartoszewski argues that Christian notions, transmitted by the church, did not have a great effect on the Polish peasantry, who maintained their own traditions which often differed from the official doctrines of the church. This thesis, stated here in stark form, is obviously subject to controversy, and it must be kept in mind that Barto- szewski's claim relates to the countryside and not to the urban settings which gave rise to modern forms of anti-Semitism. Whatever historical conclusions are reached as to the substance of this thesis, two connected methodological points should be kept in mind. The first is that the type of data cited by Bartoszewski, in which Jews appear in defined cultural images in peasant lore, in a manner that reflects local condi- tions, may be found not only in Poland and neighboring European regions, but also in North Africa.36 There is thus room for comparison, for example, 35.

Goldberg, Jewish Life in Muslim Libya: Rivals and Relatives (Chicago, 1990).</page><page sequence="20">20 HARVEY E. GOLDBERG between the Mimuna and correlative Muslim celebrations in which Jews have a role, and parallel data from the Eastern European countryside. Secondly, the question of the relationship between cultural forms stem- ming from local social life and those related to broader civilizational tradi- tions can only be asked if the difference between the two is appreciated. This is a point which bears reiteration in the context of Jewish culture, where people often take it for granted that customs "stem from" classic texts. It is only by perceiving that this link is not inevitable, but reflects a special emphasis of Jewish tradition, that the dynamics of creating and maintaining this "natural connection" can be elucidated. Turning to comparison among Jewish societies, the time is ripe for spe- cialists in European Jewish studies and researchers of Middle Eastern Jewry to begin attending to one another's work. Comparison can yield unexpected commonalities, but also useful contrasts. Using examples already cited, the examination of popular images of Jews in Morocco and Poland may point to similar processes of local stereotype formation, but might also uncover differences in the nature of the everyday cultural boundaries between Jews and non-Jews in the Muslim and Christian worlds. The existence of precir- cumcision vigils in Europe and North Africa does not mean that they are identical. Horowitz's discussion of the transformation of Jewish "nightlife" in the former region could usefully be put in juxtaposition to a model sug- gested with regard to Jerba, and adopted in a study of nineteenth-century Morocco.37 This model posits a structural contrast of "night" vs. "day" which runs parallel to the opposition of "Jew" vs. "Muslim," the spatial contrast of the "Jewish quarter" to the "market," and the religious dicho- tomy of "sacred" vs. "profane." Whatever the outcome of such a compari- son, the posing of these questions should lead to further research with regard to both the European and the Middle Eastern contexts of Jewish communal existence. Finally, the fact that aspects of Jewish culture were widely shared, even those now viewed as "esoteric" and related to the mystical tradition, pro- vides a basis for research that bridges diverse areas and Jewish traditions. For example, using the tools of psychological anthropology, Bilu has exa- mined the cases of dybbuk possession found in moralistic literature.38 He 37.

The cases he cites encompass both European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities, with no noticeable difference between them. Moreover, his analytic perspective, drawn from one field of anthropological theory, is both illuminating with regard to the material at hand and itself becomes enriched through being applied to the details of Jewish social and religious life. Conclusion Anthropology, it has been argued, while originally fashioned in research on nonliterate societies without their own written sources, has developed in a manner which permits it to be utilized in the study of traditional Jewish communities. Much of the work of contemporary anthropologists in Israel has focused on Middle Eastern Jewish groups, but, as has been emphasized by Weinreich,39 all premodern Jewish communities shared some basic char- acteristics which shaped their cultural dynamics, a situation calling for comparative studies. Various preconceptions, perhaps, have prevented scho- lars from expanding their purview in this manner. It is somewhat ironic that nineteenth-century Wissenschaft savants emphasized medieval Sepharad, to the detriment of Ashkenaz, because the former appeared to represent a more desirable "symbiosis" with the general cultural environment, while some contemporary students of Jewish history associate recent Middle Eastern Jewish culture primarily with "folklore," implicitly denigrated because of the influence of non-Jewish surroundings. We have tried to show that parallel, though not necessarily identical, processes were found in Middle Eastern and European Jewish societies, both with regard to "great tradition" facets of Jewish life and with respect to various aspects of local religion. Comparison, therefore, need not be confined to the realms of folk belief and practice. Soloveitchik has recently outlined some features of the religious culture of medieval Ashkenaz, maintaining that these differed from the situations characterizing Provence and Spain.40 His analytic approach, 39.

GOLDBERG in which the details of halakhah are scrutinized against the background of a "collective psyche," or a set of religious sensibilities which appear promin- ent in one group but not another, is clearly one to which comparative modes of inquiry are apropos. Anthropology's sensitivity to the details of social and cultural life in diverse contexts can perhaps aid in the utilization of data on both formal and popular religious behavior and thereby provide broader and deeper pictures of Jewish religious cultures in their various social settings.
