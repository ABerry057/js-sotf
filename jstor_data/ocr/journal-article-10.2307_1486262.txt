<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark R. Cohen. Jewish Self-Government in Medieval Egypt: The Origins of the Office of Head of the Jews. ca. 1065-1126. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1980. xxi, 385 pp. Although ostensibly a study of the development of a single institution, the negidate, in one country, Egypt, during a limited period, 1065-1126, this book has an importance which far transcends these limitations. From the opening chapter, "The Problem of Origins," the author makes it clear that this work represents another round in a scholarly battle which has been joined during most of this century. As in many such battles, one side has been labeled "traditional" and the other "revisionist." Cohen's book repre- sents "revisionist" historical writing at its best, closely reasoned and based on a careful reading of documentary sources. The issues surrounding the history of the office of nagid, or ra'fs al-yahad ("head of the Jews"), as it was known in Arabic, are presented by Cohen as follows: the relative importance of internal developments versus external factors; the concept of the creation of an institution by administrative fiat as opposed to its organic growth; the importance and reliability of literary sources as against documentary evidence. The "traditional" view, based on literary texts, saw the negidate as aris- ing out of the need and interests of the Fatimid regime, and the creation of the institution as resulting from the Fatimid desire to assert independence from the Baghdad caliphate. In this view, the negidate was intended as a counter to the exilarchate in the Abbasid capital. Accordingly, the Fatimids decreed the establishment of the institution-a view which contradicts the "revisionist" idea of its gradual evolution from the needs and circumstances</page><page sequence="2">238 BOOK REVIEWS of the Jewish community in Egypt, and, more specifically, from the time- honored Palestinian geonic hegemony over the Jews of the Fatimid Empire. The literary sources referred to are the Hebrew chronicle of the Egyptian Joseph Sambari (1640-1703), which resembles the responsum on this topic of Ibn Abi Zimra (1479-1573), the chief rabbi of Cairo during the first half of the sixteenth century. Another literary source is the so-called Megillat Ahima'a;, written by Ahimaaz b. Paltiel in 1054, in which the author refers to his forebear, Paltiel b. Shephatiah, a powerful figure in the entourage of the Fatimid conqueror of Egypt, al-Mu'izz (r. 953-975), as "nagid." This conflict between literary sources and documentary evidence is crucial. The Sambari-Ibn Zimra accounts mentioned above attribute the origin of the negidate to the appointment of a scion of the Davidic line from Baghdad in response to a suggestion by the caliph's bride, an Abbasid princess, who expressed surprise at the absence of this institution at the Fati- mid court. Following the Megillah, the early figure Paltiel was placed at the head of the list of negidim. For years Jewish historians struggled to fit names and dates into a coherent list of holders of the office of nagid. The great pioneer of modern Jewish historical writing, Heinrich Graetz, rejected the historicity of the saga, but others continued until very recently to rely on this material. As documents found in the Cairo Genizah began to be published, valua- ble new information became available. Still, the basic outlines of the old account were retained. Jacob Mann, for example, while rejecting the Davidic origin of the Egyptian negidate and stating that "the origin of this office is still obscure," accepted the Fatimid desire to make Egyptian Jews independent of Baghdad as the most probable reason for its creation, and Paltiel as the "most likely" first nagid. As early as 1939 David Ayalon (then Neustadt) published the first major critical rejection of the Sambari legend as well as of the Paltiel negidate. He also argued that the Fatimids were little concerned with the internal political orientation of their Jewish subjects. This led to defenses of the traditional hypothesis by E. Ashtor, H. Z. Hirschberg, and Ben-Zion Dinur, among others. In 1962 the great interpreter of Genizah material, S. D. Goitein, began a reexamination of the title and office of the negidate. The contro- versy continued, however, even after he produced convincing arguments against the traditional view. In his painstaking introduction, Cohen covers the development of this scholarly controversy to illustrate how difficult it can be for scholars to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 239 abandon strongly held positions even in the face of a mass of contradictory evidence. An important point raised and developed by Cohen is that the Jewish institution must be compared with the Coptic patriarchate of Alex- andria and its development under the Fatimids as well, because Fatimid policy toward dhimmis in general must be taken into account. This latter is the subject matter of his second chapter, "Fatimid Realities and the Coptic Patriarchate." The third chapter, subtitled "Sociological Considerations," deals with the change in the self-government of the Jews in the Fatimid Empire as revealed by documentary evidence in the Cairo Genizah. During the latter third of the eleventh century, a shift took place in the rule over the Jews of Egypt. The appointment of judges and other communal officials, previously carried out by the Palestinian gaon, the head of the Yeshivah of Jerusalem, now became the prerogative of the nagid and head of the Jews, Mevorakh b. Saadiah in Cairo. The remainder of the book traces the history of the negidate, or headship of the Jews, from its "cautious beginnings" under Judah b. Saadiah (ca. 1050) to the administration of Moses b. Mevorakh (1112-ca. 1126). It is, therefore, not a history of the institution during its entire duration, but a study of origins and of "the slow, organic adaptation of pre-existing struc- tures of Jewish self-government while contemporary Fatimid realities acted as a catalyst." Cohen is at his best in presenting the development of the scholarly debate and the arguments which he has deduced from the Genizah materials to support his views. His account of Fatimid-Coptic relations is a much- needed corrective to those Jewish historians who have ignored the impor- tant connections between the historical development of different dhimmi groups. The bulk of the book, from Appendix A to Chapter 3 through Chapter 7, or 185 pages, is a presentation of evidence and is not as well integrated into the argumentation as it might have been. But this is a minor quibble about a book which raises some important historiographic questions and presents some convincing answers. A welcome sequel would be a fulfillment of the promise of the book's title. It is, after all, only a study of origins, and not a full account of Jewish self-government in medieval Egypt. William M.
