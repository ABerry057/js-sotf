Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003. 480 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000281 David Goldenberg 's book provides a thorough review of the evidence, over whelmingly textual, regarding biblical and rabbinic attitudes toward Kushites while also exploring early Jewish attitudes toward dark-skinned people generally. At its best, this book reveals the degree to which the Bible has been reread tenden tiously by medieval and modem scholars through their own racial presuppositions. The book is learned, constructed out of prodigious research, ingenious, and broad. This reviewer learned a tremendous amount from it. Yet on another level, it is 168</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews confused, weak eyed (at times troublingly so), and stands as a perfect example of the inability to see the forest for the trees. According to Goldenberg, despite the near universality of ethnocentrism in the ancient world, racism in the modern sense did not exist. The Bible does not and could not have reflected an antiblack bias. Such sentiments derive mostly from the Greco-Roman world and were used most extensively by the church fathers, though the first real link between servitude and blackness derives from seventh-century Arabia, "when the Black became strongly identified with the slave class in the Near East" (170). It was the hegemonic culture of the Greeks and Muslims, "and their subsequent encounters with people of different color and physiognomy, [that] naturally generated descriptions of the new population groups" (192; emphasis added). These descriptions were racialist in the sense that they relied on physical differences to categorize people, but racism per se seems to have arisen only in the early modern period. Jewish material does not categorize humanity by skin color until after the Arab conquests, following the Muslim lead (185). Goldenberg finds Jewish use of the curse of Ham, which links servi tude and blackness, only after the fifteenth century (175, 356 n. 48), by which point the concomitant sociopolitical structures of antiblack oppression had become real. To perpetuate the benefits of this structured oppression, many later Euro-American writers were guilty of insisting, no "matter how patently absurd" (176) the assertion, that the Bible conveyed a curse on Ham and on blacks. The most important contribution of this book is Goldenberg's cogent argu ments that the Bible is not the origin of antiblack racism. He offers historicized readings of the original biblical contexts that are often convincing. Kush and the various Kushite figures are characterized positively. Moses' Kushite wife is so called probably because she comes from the Negev or North Arabian Kushites, whose territorial name, Kushan, "is a lengthened form of Kush," according to scholars, and is frequently paralleled to Midian, Zipporah's homeland (28-29). Afrocentrists should appreciate how he restores Kush as a positively imagined kingdom commanding power, martial prowess, and respect. More questionable is Goldenberg's interpretation of rabbinic literature. Here, he argues that the term "Kushite," used to refer to both people and objects, has no ethnic meaning but rather signifies only somatic darkness. Kushite figures, such as Ebedmelech, who served King Hizkiyahu, receive posi tive elaboration. The metaphorical characterization of Saul and others as Kushites alludes to their outstanding moral features. The Kushite maidservant who appears in several parables may well not be an ethnic Kushite but merely a common trope of the dark-skinned Other who is held up against the preferred lighter-skinned ideal, seen also in commentary on the heroine of Song of Songs. Talmudic state ments that priests cannot be too dark, among other bodily "issues," and the bles sing to be said on seeing Kushites, among other "different" kinds of people, reflect only the same widespread somatic norms and praise of god for the variety of human physiques, respectively. Postrabbinic texts, influenced by Islamic discourse, proffered racialist deni grations of blacks, but Goldenberg generally minimizes their significance because of their derivative nature. He ignores a handful of medieval scholars such as 169</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Ibn Ezra, who writes that "some say" Ham was cursed with servitude and black ness, asserting that he is referring to non-Jews, though Goldenberg cannot adduce any evidence for this assertion. Goldenberg also mysteriously ignores prominent texts by Maimonides, Yehuda ha-Levi, and Abarbanel that explicitly discuss Kushites or blackness/whiteness in an ethnic sense. When it comes to the many later writers who insisted that the Bible conveyed a curse on Ham and on blacks, Goldenberg 's examples are all Christian. The one Jewish corroboration that Goldenberg brings?and only in a footnote (357 n. 60)?is from the nine teenth century, despite the existence of many other earlier voices. Goldenberg's positive reading of rabbinic material contradicts his own evi dence, which shows that many Greco-Romans and thinkers from all three post biblical monotheisms held antiblack views, whether metaphorical, somatic, ethnic, or some combination thereof. Goldenberg 's discomfort with considering negative meanings of blackness is surprising in light of his own admission that throughout the postbiblical world, including Judean spheres, "most Blacks, as foreigners in general, were slaves" (134). It makes one wonder how convincing it is to argue that such denigrating attitudes had no sociopolitical ramifications. I am amazed to leam, for example, that the "accumulating negative effects of Black-as-sinner-or-devil exegesis"?based on classical climatic notions, among other things (i.e., that blacks were lowly, cowards, ugly, deformed by their environment)?does not "reflect an antipathy toward black Africans" (51). Goldenberg himself concludes, after much back-bending dismissal, that the trope of the accursed Ham as a black "certainly dates to the fourth century (R. Joseph; redaction of the Palestinian Talmud), probably to the third-century (Marqe), and possibly to the second or third century (tannaitic etiology)" (156). It is astounding to me that Goldenberg concludes that medieval Arabic and early modem English sources wielded blackness as an ethnic identifier but that rabbinic sources using the originally ethnic term "Kushite" referred only to somatic color (198). Regarding the curse on Ham in rabbinic and postrabbinic material, Golden berg's logic escapes me. "If the curse was to be one of dark skin, a dark-skinned population would have to be found to carry the curse. Ham, as the biblical ancestor of the dark-skinned Egyptians and Kushites would fit the bill, and so, of course, would Kush" (101). This has it completely backward: The curse was wielded precisely to explain the origin of the "abnormality" of human blackness and to rationalize the denigration or mistreatment of those "lesser" black peoples bearing this "abnormality." Goldenberg asserts (106-10) that because the biblical exegetes, both Jewish and Muslim, "originally" applied the curse of blackness to Ham?ancestor of many "dark" peoples?and not to Kush?the eponymous ancestor of the Kushites/Ethiopians?this discursive seme cannot be seen as anti black or racialist! Goldenberg's conclusion that the curse was "originally" applied by interpreters only to Ham himself, and thus was not an etiological explanation of a collective phenomenon, leaves me unconvinced given the highly fraught sym bolic status of such biblical figures. Finally, many of the texts he uses to show that postbiblical Jewish and early Christian interpreters distinguished between a curse of servitude and a curse of somatic darkness (Chap. 12) seem to prove 170</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews exactly the opposite. Blackness and servitude are here additive, complementary, and conflated, not separated. The cause of much of Goldenberg's hermeneutic myopia is twofold. First, notwithstanding his thorough philological research and exposition, I find his ana lyses of definitions such as ethnocentrism and racism curt and inadequate, reading at times as afterthoughts.1 Second is Goldenberg's unself-conscious positivist approach, which makes him believe that he can define "the correct reading" of a passage (7). After all, he writes, "philology is a fairly exact science" (141), a quaint but, I believe, obsolete view. Most of the educated guesses regarding ancient ethnic groups, geography, toponyms, etymologies, and the like remain speculation. Goldenberg's thoroughness proves it; he frequently alerts us to con tinuing scholarly disputes over these matters, indicating that one should hardly make definitive assertions about the "real world" in the texts, though he does pre cisely this throughout the book. Even some of the most basic terms have meanings we cannot definitively recapture. The resulting conclusions remain far from clear, for obvious reasons, and sometimes consist simply of assertions.2 The issues are eminently hermeneutical, yet Goldenberg refuses to admit as much. For example, he holds that scribal errors and other deviations? varying interpretations of the original correct meaning?cannot be "correct" even if they become accepted by a group of interpreters or a large swath of 1. In contrast, Benjamin Isaac's recent book, The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004), which lays out in painstaking detail the contours of what the author calls classical "proto-racism," opens with methodologically oriented chapters cover ing more than 200 pages. 2. For example, Kush, called "Land of the Bow" by the Egyptians, "may even derive from [the Ethiopians'] famed ability" in archery" (34), though "others are of the opinion" that "Land of the Bow" refers to the great bend in the Nile (233 n. 59). Goldenberg's attempt to locate the "real" Tarshish yields a mass of contradictory data from which he simply chooses the solution that suits his thesis (42-^43). When discussing midrashic texts that use black skin as a sign of sinfulness or evil, Goldenberg suddenly asserts that it is possible that the Kushites of these texts were "dark-skinned Arabs rather than black Africans" because they are said to live in the tents of Kedar (244 n. 17), though he immediately acknowledges that the point and significance of the metaphor remains the same. Goldenberg asserts that Josephus, the targum, and the rabbis would not have mentioned that Moses married an Ethiopian woman if this were considered demeaning (56). Such reasoning strikes me as ludicrous given that the Bible itself offers marriage to a Kushite as a possible reading and later exegetes saw their job as inter preting their prooftexts, not denying them. "There is no question," opines Goldenberg, "that with the translation 'India' the Targum to Isa. 18:1 meant East Africa" (60); how Goldenberg knows this remains a mystery. His efforts to prove that certain midrashic passages about Alexander the Great in the Moun tains of Darkness are set in "black Africa" (64-67) seem to me unfounded and full of circular reasoning; the locations, people, and events of these midrashic passages "would perfectly fit a location in the land of the Ethiopians" (66), he writes, giving away this game of finding "black Africans" in every end-of the-earth setting. Nonetheless, by the end of this section, Goldenberg asserts that these stories reflect the rabbinic notion that "those at the edges of the earth, specifically the Ethiopians, are wise, just, and righteous" (67), though not one of the cited texts mentions Ethiopia or Ethiopians. Goldenberg's emphatic dismissal of "Kushite" as a negative term becomes almost amusing when he discusses its rab binic application to Egyptians and other "s?mites" (e.g., 117-28), almost always in a negative sense; but he is unwilling to consider that the authors' choice of this term had polemical implications that played off the metaphoric meanings of blackness. 171</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews society. The silliness of this reasoning surfaces in Appendix I, where Golden berg goes through all the Kushites "mistakenly" inserted into classical rabbinic texts. But these "insertions" should not be judged against some "correct" orig inal because they are authentic elements of postrabbinic and medieval dis course; surprisingly, Goldenberg fails to discuss them as such within the main body of the text. Though he relies on a wide variety of scholarship on the biblical and rab binic worlds, Goldenberg fails to contextualize or historicize this variegated body of work and its authors. Claims are taken seemingly at random, when they support his arguments, from whichever scholar happens to offer them. No effort is made to understand the ethnic politics at work in and behind, say, nineteenth-century German or English Protestant biblical scholarship or the nationalist politics similarly operative within Israeli archaeological circles. (This is not to categorize an entire schools of thought as homogeneous, only to insist on some kind of analysis.) Compounding this absence is Goldenberg's frequent statements that such-and-such a reading has or has not found acceptance among biblical scholars today, as if the objective meaning of a text were a matter of consensus, as if today's scholars have a monopoly on knowledge. A similar ahistoricism surfaces in Goldenberg's frequent references to the anthropology of contemporary Africa to explicate things noticed by the ancients. The ancient authors note the excellent eyesight and archery skills of various Ethio pian peoples, "a characteristic of the Kushites," according to Goldenberg, that "has continued into relatively modem times. In 1790 James Bmce wrote about the Shankella at the lower end of the Blue Nile" (34-35). Never mind the millennia of intervening population movements, the shifting African of empires, and then the early modem wars or that the "Shankella" likely have nothing to do with Pliny's Nisicathae and Nisitae or the "Nubians" featured on Egyptian tombs from 2000 BCE that he cites (34). Ancient attitudes have nothing to do with modem racialized European society and discourse, but things in black Africa? a concept that Goldenberg frequently imports into the texts?always remain just the same. Was anyone in any of these areas considered a "black" by the rabbis, or is this a bizarre invention of Goldenberg's? Just what is "black Africa" to Goldenberg? The book's production could have been more careful. Perhaps inevitably, given Goldenberg's approach of microdissection, some repetition of points and examples occurs. One chapter is literally two pages (Chap. 6), and Section III of the book comprises only a single chapter (Chap. 9). An absolutely maddening oversight of the publisher, given the scope and density of the endnotes, is the lack of a bibliography.
