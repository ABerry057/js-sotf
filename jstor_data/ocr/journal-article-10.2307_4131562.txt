<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugene Ulrich. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible: Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Col., 1999. xviii, 309 pp. Eugene Ulrich is John A. O'Brien Professor of Hebrew Scriptures at the Uni- versity of Notre Dame. Since his graduate student days at Harvard in the early 1970s, he has been studying and writing about the biblical text, that is, the text of 121</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review the Hebrew Bible as transmitted and translated in antiquity. His primary claim to academic fame, and at one point public notoriety, is his ongoing leadership in edit- ing and publishing the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is Ulrich's interpretations of these scrolls in the context of the history and development of the biblical text that form the subject of the first eight of his essays collected here. These essays, especially the first six, are also bound to be the most interesting to nonspecialists. (The re- mainder of the book is taken up with fairly technical discussions of the Septuagint and the Old Latin.) By assembling these essays in one place, Ulrich intends, I think, nothing less than a paradigm shift in our understanding of the history of the biblical text. Up until now (and for many this is still the case), biblical scholars have tended to posit a sharp break between the period of the text's composition and its transmission and translation as Scripture. The former, characterized by often extensive literary and theological activity (the extent of this activity, although not its existence, is the sub- ject of debate between conservative and centrist-critical scholars), is the domain of higher criticism. At some point, as early as the Persian period for some blocks of biblical material, composition comes to an end, and copying begins: This is properly the field of inquiry for textual or lower criticism. Ulrich urges us to scrap this dichotomy and to recognize that creative literary activity on the biblical text continued far longer than generally accepted, in some cases into the common era. Apparently there were scribes more adventurous than their fellow "copyists" to whom we are indebted for this extraordinary process. As Ulrich sees it, the evidence for this activity, primarily in the form of dou- ble literary editions (i.e., extended literary units demonstrably changed from an earlier to a later form "to a sufficient extent that the resultant form should be called a revised edition"), was already staring us in the face in the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch. But before Qumran, it could be argued that Greek texts widely divergent from the Masoretic Hebrew were the result of manipulation by the translators and that almost all distinctive elements in the Samaritan Pentateuch rep- resented tendentious sectarian (mis)handling of an already established text. In Ul- rich's interpretation, the Scrolls provide incontrovertible evidence that double lit- erary editions existed in the Hebrew throughout the Second Temple period and that they frequently circulated simultaneously and in the same circles. Such textual plu- riformity was an accepted element among Jews, who would recognize certain books as "authoritative" without insisting upon a single, uniform "inspired" text for each of these books. In support of his argument, Ulrich lays out in detail evi- dence from Exodus, First Samuel, and Jeremiah, all of which (among others) ex- hibit substantial double literary editions in the Scrolls from Qumran. Ulrich's presentation is a clear challenge to those fundamentalists who argue that there has always been one authoritative and recognized text of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. But a greater challenge to most scholars, especially those in- volved in Bible translation, arises from the implications of Ulrich's research on the already thorny question of what a version of the Hebrew Bible should be reflecting. Although Ulrich allows for religiously-sponsored or -centered translations that are based on a particular text, such as the Leningrad Codex (for Biblia Hebraica Quin- 122</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ta and earlier editions) or the Aleppo Codex (for the Hebrew University Bible Proj- ect), he urges the creation of a critically established text, drawing systematically and without bias from all traditions and texts. Because this is the guiding princi- ple of the Oxford Hebrew Bible, whose chief editor is Ron Hendel, we can imag- ine that in theory the resultant base text and translation of this project will please Ulrich. We will have to wait and see how it turns out in practice. Although Ulrich describes the ancient era ofpluriformity as something quite foreign to contemporary usage, it strikes me that, for most modern readers of the Bible who rely on translations, the situation today is quite similar to the older one. After all, a person who reads Jeremiah in the ArtScroll version comes away with a rather different understanding than the user of the JPS Tanakh. And the variations widen considerably if we bring in, for example, the New King James Version, the Contemporary English Version, or the Living Bible (which must be distinguished from Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah!). The book of Jeremiah, all may agree, is in- spired, but the actual words exhibit substantial variation. In essence, modem plu- riformity! The richness and subtlety of Ulrich's discussion are, I hope, clear to poten- tial readers. It remains to ask whether the format adopted by this volume, a col- lection spanning two decades, is the best method of presentation. On this point, there is reason for ambivalence. Most users, it is clear, can discern and evaluate Ulrich's main points on the basis of one or two of these essays. Reading them se- riatim exposes even specialists to considerable repetition and may lead to unnec- essary confusion on the part of nonspecialists. But, taken as a whole, Ulrich's book is important, even essential, in the ongoing quest for greater understanding of the Hebrew Bible. For that, we should all be grateful. Leonard J.
