<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oliver Leaman. Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy. Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. xiii, 257 pp. Oliver Leaman's Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy is an exploration of Jewish views on theodicy that, while structured as an historical study, is in large part a constructive theology. The focus of Leaman's study is the book of Job. According to Leaman, the story of Job provides the ideal model for dealing with unjustified suffering. First, it teaches us which reactions to suffering are incorrect. Suffering is not a warrant to deny God's existence. As Leaman points out, Job never entertains this alternative. Nor should one look to God to explain why He inflicts suffering. God is totally "other" than</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 255 his creatures and is therefore inscrutable. It is for this reason that God does not give Job an explanation for his suffering at the end of the book when He appears in the whirlwind. A corollary to this point which Leaman consistently emphasizes is that one must reject the idea that suffering can be explained as divine punishment for sin. This too relegates God to the level of human beings in that one is projecting upon God a simplistic human calculus that one inflicts pain when a crime has been committed. A critique of this type of explanation for suffering comes through in the book of Job when, toward the end of the story, Job's friends are admonished for having applied this approach to Job. What then is the proper response to unjustified suffering? According to Leaman, suffering has the purpose of forcing us to examine and evaluate our relationship with God, and to transform ourselves in the light of our experience. Suffering places the onus entirely on us; it is we who must respond to the pain we experience to become better human beings and forge a better relationship with God. This notion is reflected in the book of Job in that Job is rewarded for remaining silent after God appears in the whirlwind, thereby acknowledging that God will provide him with no explanation. The implication here is that the burden is on Job to make sense of his suffering. There is nothing terribly original about this interpretation of Job. What is original is that Leaman attempts to show that the great Jewish philosophers, both medieval and modemrn, for the most part support the theodicy which Leaman sees in Job. For this purpose, Leaman devotes chapters to Philo, Saadiah, Maimonides, and Gersonides in the rabbinic and medieval periods, as well as to Spinoza, Mendelssohn, Cohen, Buber, and the Holocaust theologians treated collectively, in the modem period. (Leaman perhaps should have included a chapter on Mordecai Kaplan, whose thinking fits in nicely with his argument.) Thus, for example, Maimonides, according to Leaman's reading, deals with unjustified suffering by rejecting the simplistic notion that suffering is punishment for sin and instead favors an approach that places the burden on human beings to rise above their suffering by seeing the superiority of spiritual rewards over those which are material. As Leaman sees it, this is how Maimonides understands Job's transformation at the end of the book. To cite another example, Leaman argues that Buber's theodicy in general and his reading of Job in particular also support the view that the onus is on us to transform ourselves and our relationship with God in the light of suffering. For Buber evil of the kind experienced by Job can only be dealt with by seeking an encounter with God of the kind that Job experiences</page><page sequence="3">256 BOOK REVIEWS at the end of the book, an encounter that leaves an indelible mark on our personality and subsequent actions. As Leaman readily admits, not all Jewish philosophers fall neatly into his line of thinking. Thus, for instance, Leaman acknowledges that Saadiah Gaon supports the simplistic reward-and-punishment model of suffering. Yet most of the philosophers whom Leaman examines are co-opted into his approach. Leaman's analysis is at times highly creative and original. He covers vast territory with a style that is personable and engaging. Particularly intriguing, for instance, is his attempt to construct a Spinozistic reading of the book of Job which supports his central argument. That Job responds with acquiescence to a God who offers no explanation for his condition other than to proclaim Himself Lord over nature fits well with Spinoza's view that all human events are strictly determined and that in the face of evil one can only acknowledge the rationality of the natural world that is in turn identified with God. There are, however, a number of problems with Leaman's argument. First, on the logistical level, it is perplexing that Leaman makes no use of footnotes to separate his own interpretations from those of his predecessors. His discussion of Holocaust theology, for example, reiterates arguments already made by Steven Katz and other scholars. With respect to the content of Leaman's argument, the purpose of his study as set out in the introduction is not quite fulfilled. Leaman promises to deal with the question of theodicy as it relates to the specific situation of the Jewish people (p. 2). As he points out, while the Jewish philosopher must grapple with unjustified suffering in humanity at large, the suffering of the Jewish people poses special problems, given their special covenantal relationship with God. Leaman's analysis does not really focus on this question, but instead tends to deal with theodicy as a universal issue. Perhaps this is not surprising, since Leaman is almost exclusively concerned with Job. The connection between Job's suffering and Jewish suffering is not necessarily an obvious one given Job's vague lineage and the fact that Job's suffering, at least in the biblical account, is never located within the context of the historical relationship between God and the Jewish people. Even the rabbis questioned whether Job was Jewish. If one is to confront the specific problem of Jewish suffering by looking into the Bible, the chastisements in Leviticus and Deuteronomy are a far more appropriate starting-point than the book of Job, a direction in thinking that Leaman rejects and for understandable reasons.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 257 Nor does Leaman effectively demonstrate that the philosophers he ex- amines saw a connection between Job's suffering and that of Israel. As the leading scholar of medieval Jewry, Maimonides constantly addresses Jewish suffering in his writings; but it remains to be shown that his reading of Job is concerned with this issue. Gersonides addresses the question of Jewish suffering extensively, but mostly in biblical commentaries unrelated to Job, texts which Leaman does not consult. Saadiah, I believe, alludes to the issue of Jewish suffering in his commentary on Job-but the connection is by no means obvious. It is also not clear that Job really provides the best model for the type of theodicy that Leaman supports. Job is in some sense rewarded for his suffering in that his family and possessions are finally restored to him. Thus the very reward-and-punishment scheme which Leaman so vehemently rejects is in evidence here. Moreover, the very fact that God communicates with Job at the end of the book upsets Leaman's attempt to use Job as a paradigm for a theodicy from which all human beings can learn. Job faces a God who is inscrutable but very much present to him, a luxury that many people who live through unjustified suffering do not experience. Indeed, these problems have been pointed out by other modem thinkers, such as Emil Fackenheim, who quite explicitly reject Job as a model for theodicy--though, significantly, Leaman passes over this point in his positive assessment of Fackenheim's theology. Nor does Leaman's analysis adequately define what it means to transform oneself in response to suffering. Leaman seems to leave the details of this transformation up to the particular individual or community affected by suffering. Are there no standards here? Is any response appropriate as long as one feels that one has grown in light of one's suffering? Yet despite these flaws, Leaman's book is very much worthwhile. He is to be commended for offering an original treatment of one of philosophy's most intractable problems. If he does not manage to solve the issue of theodicy in an entirely satisfactory manner, he is in good company with many, if not all, of the great philosophers of the past.
