Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1995. xvi, 506 pp. Gideon Shimoni's The Zionist Ideology is aptly named. It is a study about nineteenth- and twentieth-century ideologues who demonstrated the courage of their convictions-and evictions--and subsequently convinced the Jewish Diaspora of the importance and significance of Jewish nationalism. Against</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 267 the backdrop of the European origins of modem Zionism (antisemitism, pogroms, assimilation, nationalism), the author examines important luminar- ies, reading their ideas in a literary, political, or cultural genre and within the context of other Zionist thinkers. He explores the lives of the theorists, their messages concerning what Zionism is and what Zionism demands, relevant Jewish values and tradition, and the role of Jewish nationalism in the life of contemporary Jewry. In eight well-argued and substantially documented chapters (there are nearly 100 pages of notes and bibliography), the author pays close attention to the claim that Zionism is ethnic nationalism; and he is particularly interested in analyzing the connection between a writer and his work, the attitude a thinker takes toward events past and present, and how Jewish intellectual history contributed immeasurably to the establishment of the State of Israel. After investigating the precursors and venues of Zionist ideology and its multiplicity of expressions (political, spiritual, synthetic, religious, labor, and revisionist), Shimoni takes on two of Zionism's most discussed and perplexing themes: Zionism as a national religion for secular Jews, and Zionism's ideological claim of the legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel. Most of Zionism's major thinkers are broadly drawn, taking on entire careers on the small canvas Shimoni generally works in this volume, seeking out worldly and spiritual nooks and crannies that bear further exploration. Illustrations are in order. Moses Hess viewed the Yishuv as a socialist com- monwealth, whose infrastructure would primarily consist of Jewish masses from Eastern Europe and the Moslem world. Rabbis Zvi Hirsch Kalischer and Yehudah Alkali are portrayed as autonomous messianic activists who clashed with the authoritative rabbinical pietism, passivism, and quietism of the day. Theodor Herzl's functional Zionism meant that the Judennot (downtrodden condition of the Jews) would be solved by a Judenstaat (Jews' state), fully committed to moral and spiritual integrity. In contrast, Ahad Ha'am's organic Zionism mainly spoke not of a state of Jews but a Jewish state of mind; that is to say, the Yishuv not merely as a refuge for the oppressed, or an historical memory, but as the sine qua non center for the spiritual health of the Jewish people in the Land and in the far-flung Diaspora, and for the preservation and development of its heritage. The ideals of Labor Zionism, rooted in nineteenth-century national lib- eration movements and general socialist thought, were stated differently by Nachman Syrkin, Ber Borochov, and A. D. Gordon. Syrkin's brochure,</page><page sequence="3">268 BOOK REVIEWS The Jewish Problems and the Socialist Jewish State (1898), was the first systematic attempt to formulate messianic tradition within a socialist context. Borochov's first major study, The National Question and the Class Struggle (1905), integrated Jewish nationalism with orthodox Marxist thought, and a year later, Our Platform (1906) spoke of a proletarian Zionism that "will be consummated by political territorial autonomy in Palestine."' Gordon asserted that nations are cosmic phenomena, the results of the interaction between man and nature in a given geographical area; thereby, the Jew in exile was stunted, and by returning to and working the soil of his/her natural habitat the marginal Diaspora Jew would be restored to physical and spiritual wholeness. Moreover, he insisted that a "living culture," embracing the whole of life, took precedence over "high culture" (science, art, poetry, ethics, religion): "is it possible to make butter without milk or will man make butter from milk belonging to others and will the butter then be his very own?" ("Labor," quoted on p. 309). Micah Yosef Berdyczewski's declaration ("we shall either be the last of the Jews or the first of a new nation") helped launch a "transvaluation of values": ethnic kinship rather than religious creeds and deeds as the basis of Jewish identity; also, Yosef Haim Brenner's radical negation of the Galut (existence and morality) reflected his disdain for rabbinical mores and influences. Notwithstanding, Martin Buber's "Hebrew humanism" was rooted in his take of humanness found in sacred literature and understood in two primary word pairs: I-Thou and I-It. Thus, for Buber, Zionism was fundamentally social, consisting of interpersonal relations between self and other, whose path leads to righteousness, justice, and moral action: "the human aspect of life begins the moment we say to ourselves: we will do no more injustice to others then we are focused to do in order to exist" ("The National Home," quoted on p. 349). And many more pioneers, thinkers, movers and shakers are dutifully recorded and discerned by Shimoni. Of special note, Zev Jabotinsky's integral nationalism, Jacob Klatzkin's radical dissection of Ahad Ha'am's seminal ideas, Berel Katznelson's message on tradition and revolution (socialist), and Yehezkel Kaufmann's four-volume Golah ve-Nekhar ("Exile and Alienness"). More than anything else, Shimoni's diagnostic methodology reveals the dynamics and nuances of the Zionist revolution: diverse and desperate 1. Ber Borochov, "Our Platform," in The Zionist Idea, ed.

For example, Zev Jabotinsky, Chaim Weizmann, and David Ben-Gurion, despite different viewpoints, argued aggressively and seemingly uniformly before international forums for the justice of a Jewish Palestine. Negating the Diaspora mentality is what the mosaic of Zionist faith is about. There is no alternative to action on a national scale; the Galut cannot cure itself. This issue is what each of Shimoni's cast of characters (including non-Zionist and anti-Zionist personalities and movements) had to face at some point: whether to participate in Zionism's Endziel, by choice or by obligation, and to what degree. The Zionist Ideology can now join A. Hertzberg's The Zionist Idea (New York, 1972), W. Laqueur's A History of Zionism (New York, 1972), S. Avineri's The Making of Modern Zionism (New York, 1981), and A. Elon's The Israelis: Founders and Sons (New York, 1983) as a core curriculum for teaching Zionism on the college level.2 More, probably. Why so? More focused than the others on the private selves and public voices of Zionism's titans and regulars, Shimoni unveils realism and schizophrenia on the way to statehood, and this will strike a chord in many readers in a post-Zionist ideological age. Nearly fifty years after the State of Israel was proclaimed, whither the security of the Zionist entity in an era of accords, assassination, and terror?
