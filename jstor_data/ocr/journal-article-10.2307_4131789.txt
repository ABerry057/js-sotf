New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000. xxiv, 392 pp. This book is, without a doubt, a major contribution in the field of Judeo- Persian Studies. Judeo-Persian literature, which extends for about eight centuries, has been severely neglected except for the work of a small number of scholars. There are only four scholars in the United States who have dealt with any aspect of this field, and not many more elsewhere. The existing Judeo-Persian texts are a vast collection of all sorts of material and deserve much more attention. Vera Basch Moreen has made a great step forward by providing translation of a wide variety of literary texts. Especially valuable are her commentaries, explanations, and bib- liography. Jews who have lived in Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia and for whom Persian is their spoken language have, until fairly recently, been able to read and write the language only in the Hebrew alphabet and not in Arabic script. It is clear, however, from the varied Judeo-Persian texts in this book and in others that Jews must have heard Persian poetry recited in public and have had many texts read to them. The texts represented in this book are a clear indication of their generally detailed familiarity with non-Jewish texts. Moreen's commentary and footnotes make this abundantly clear. A listing of the chapters provides a good survey of the Judeo-Persian liter- ature represented: 1. Earliest Judeo-Persian Texts; 2. Biblical Epics; 3. An Apoc- ryphal Epic; 4. Didactic Poetry; 5. Mishnah and Midrash; 5. Biblical Commen- taries; 7. Religious Festivals in Sermon, Commentary, and Poetry; 8. Historical Texts; 9. Polemics and Philosophy; 10. Mysticism; 11. Religious Poems; and 12. Panegyrics, Lyrical Poems, Quatrains. Moreen's translations are masterful and accurate. Her notes and commen- tary are especially useful and provide enormously interesting information on Is- lamic, historical, and all sorts of textual background and information. Just read- ing through the footnotes and other explanations gives the reader fascinating information on the cultural context of the Persian world in various periods. 144</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In going through the pages of this remarkable book, I am reminded that in 1973, Amnon Netzer published in Tehran an anthology of Judeo-Persian poetry transcribed into Arabic script. Soon after the book appeared, a review written by a very prominent Tehran University professor of Persian literature was published in a literary journal in Tehran. "Here is an anthology of Judeo-Persian poetry of al- most 1000 years, of which we have known nothing," he began. He then praised the book and marveled at the nature of the texts provided in the anthology. Vera Moreen's book, too, is truly to be welcomed as a most useful source for this marvelous but relatively unknown Jewish literature. Perhaps it will spark an upsurge of interest and research in this field. Herbert H. Paper HUC-JIR Cincinnati, Ohio</page></plain_text>
