<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jane S. Gerber. The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience. New York: Free Press, 1992. xxv, 333 pp. The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience is, on the whole, an excellent one-volume history of the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula from their earliest days until the present. Emerging in time for the quincentennial commemoration of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, this scholarly study incorporates an impressive amount of up-to-date research by scholars in each of the numerous fields and time periods discussed. Gerber's strength lies in her ability to synthesize the material covered in these works, a process that results in the presentation of a fairly accurate and vivid picture of Sephardi life at different times and in different places. For example, the chapter entitled "Volatile Origins" agilely tackles a difficult topic, the realia of Jewish life during Visigothic rule, adroitly avoiding the unsolved debate as to who was behind the anti-Jewish policy, the kings or the clerics. The analysis of the Moslem period includes a lovely journey through the outstanding Jewish communities, a good depiction of Cordova, and the political complexities of Moslem rule. The chapter on the Reconquista is particularly concise and well written, and presents an accurate picture of the role of the Jews during this period. In the chapter entitled "Path to Expulsion," Gerber ventures to offer figures for Jews and conversos involved in each of the various events during this century. In light of the fact that experts in the field are still debating</page><page sequence="2">220 BOOK REVIEWS about the number of Jews who converted in 1391 as well as about those expelled in 1492, perhaps Gerber is a bit too bold in offering figures. She states that "perhaps as many as 30,000 conversos" (p. 130) were destroyed by the Spanish Inquisition, yet recent scholarship does not concur. One must keep in mind the fact that judaizers dominated as defendants in the Tribunal's courts between 1483 and 1530, and again between 1630 and 1730, after Portuguese New Christians crossed the border. Inquisition experts such as Jaime Contreras and Gustav Henningsen have been creating data banks and analyzing figures based on 44,000 trials (1540-1700); nowhere are there extant records with figures that remotely approach 30,000. For example, William Monter concluded that 1,500 conversos were killed between 1480 and 1530, and 250 between 1630 and 1730; in the intermediate period, another 1,000 (non-converso) victims died at the hands of the inquisitors.' The sum total of these numbers is not even 3,000, or a tenth of Gerber's figure. At the same time, the author succumbs to the temptation of overemphasizing the role of torture in these trials; quite often, the fear of torture was most effective, negating any need for it. Even Henry Charles Lea noted that the Spanish Inquisition did not utilize torture as frequently or as severely as did secular courts.2 Gerber is on much firmer ground when she follows the exiles to the Islamic world, aptly describing the Sephardic Diaspora and characterizing the nature of the Sephardi. She then moves westward, to the Americas, Italy, Holland, and France. The particularly elusive New Christian community in France is evaluated well; the author is wise not to draw a final conclusion. The Sephardim of the East are adroitly contrasted to those who settled in the West; those choosing England as their home are assessed fairly, as are the Sephardim of the United States. As Gerber points out, they risked assimilation even as they "establish[ed] pioneering settlements in Western societies" (p. 211). The fate of many of the Sephardim depended upon developments in the Ottoman Empire and the rise of European nationalism; Gerber perceptively questions the relevance of applying Western notions such as emancipation and citizenship to non-Moslems in a Moslem state (p. 217). In discussing the modernization of the Jews of Turkey, however, she makes no mention of 1. E. William Monter, Frontiers of Heresy (New York, 1990), p. 53. 2.

While this country did indeed cancel the planned deportations of its own Jewish citizens, it was responsible for the demise of some 11,500 Jews living in territory under its control. (The 6,000-7,000 Jews of Thrace mentioned on p. 250 were part of this group.) While no mention is made of the concentration camps set up in 1942 in Bengazi, Libya, the figure given for Algerian Resistance fighters in Operation Torch should be close to 400, not 200, since about half of the 800 members participated in the liberation (p. 251).4 The final chapter, "Revival and Return," is, in my opinion, somewhat uneven. The saga of the breakdown of the Jewish communities in the Moslem world is skillfully related, and the eventual return of Jews to Spain includes an interesting account of that country's ambiguity in dealing with Jews in the past two centuries. The assessment of the recent immigration of Sephardim to France and America is well done. Yet Gerber begins to have difficulty with her definition of Sephardim in precisely this period. While thus far her work on the Sephardic experience has been devoted to the history of the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula and their descendants, suddenly some indisputably non-Sephardic groups are included. Needless to say, there has always been some ambiguity concerning the "Sephardic" nature of certain communities that existed prior to the arrival of Sephardi immigrants. Due to the resulting amalgam, the Syrian, North African, and Egyptian Jews can ostensibly be termed Sephardi even if the term is not entirely accurate. The Iranian Jews are often included as Sephardim simply because they obtained printed copies of the Sephardic prayerbook, yet this community was never affected by the presence of Sephardic exiles and should not be considered Sephardic. Moreover, how does Gerber justify listing the Yemenites (or, for that matter, the Afghanis) as "Sephardic congregations" (p. 271)? Why have the criteria for determining who the Sephardim are changed in the twentieth century? Clearly, Gerber has strayed from her geographical base, and a group like the Yemenites, whose tradition is so obviously different from that of the 3.

Lastly, the author is far too delicate and polite in her assessment of the pressure and the "unintentional slights and mistakes of the first generation of Israeli state builders" (p. 281). A more realistic assessment of the political situation and the Ashkenazi attitude to non-Ashkenazi immigrants in the 1960s would point to a much stronger "assault on Sephardic culture" (p. 281) as well as on all it represented in the eyes of secular policy- and decision-makers. In retrospect, Gerber has expertly synthesized a tremendous amount of material dealing with numerous periods and developments in the history of the Sephardim. I suspect that the occasional omissions and errors do not reflect upon the quality of her work as a scholar, but rather on the lack of ample time to check and recheck data owing to the pressures of publication while striving to ensure the appearance of this book in time for the quincentennial year. Despite the aforementioned criticism, there is no doubt that Gerber's book is an important and timely contribution to the study of the Sephardic heritage.
