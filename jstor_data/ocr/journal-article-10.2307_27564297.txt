Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006. xiv, 340 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S036400940700058X A link between violence and radical Islamic movements in the modem era is indisputable. Although many insist that an appeal to Islam to justify acts such as 9/11 is a perversion of its essence, more radical elements in the Muslim commu nity have invoked religion to justify not only violent attacks on the "Crusader" and the "Zionist" but even attacks on other Muslims viewed as insufficiently zealous in their defense of absolute religious truth. Historically, a variety of Christian move ments have also invoked religion to justify massive violence directed outward, during the Crusades, or inward, in repeated attempts to suppress heresy and dissent. But what about Judaism? Is there a legacy of Jewish violence? Elliott Horowitz's provocative new book, Reckless Rites: Purim and the Legacy of Jewish Violence, examines that question. Horowitz, an associate professor of Jewish history at Bar-Ilan University, has plumbed a rich trove of sources spanning two millennia and writes with uncommon elegance and humor. His book investigates a series of events taking place over many centuries: accounts of Jewish violence against pagans in antiquity, against Christians in med ieval and early modem Europe, and more recently against Muslims on the West Bank. "Violence" is understood to refer not only to acts of physical aggression but also to insulting gestures and offensive speech. And though it would be foolish to insist that violence has occurred only at Purim, Horowitz makes a good case that a ritualized or scripted Jewish violence has sometimes emerged at Purim because of the removal then of customary restraints. In his introduction, Horowitz follows a reverse chronology. He begins with a series of interviews published in the New Yorker in 2004 in which some ultra Orthodox Jews identify Palestinians as the (spiritual) descendants of the ancient biblical enemy of the Jewish people, Amalek. At Exodus 17:14-16, God promises to wage perpetual war on the Amalekites and to utterly blot out the memory of Amalek. Elsewhere, it is the Israelites who are commanded to "blot out the remem brance of Amalek from under heaven" (Deuteronomy 25:19; cf. I Samuel 15:2-3). Although genealogically Palestinian Arabs are not descendants of Amalek, histori cally Jewish interpreters have understood "Amalek" to refer allegorically to Romans, medieval Christians, and now Palestinian Arabs. Amalek has come to symbolize every dangerous enemy of the Jews. What does the promise of perpetual war against Amalek and the Amalekites have to do with Purim and the book's title, Reckless Rites? In the book of Esther, 365</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Haman is identified as a descendant of the Amalekite king Agag, and the Torah reading for the morning of Purim is taken from Exodus 17:8-16 and its promise that the Lord "will have war against Amalek from generation to generation." Horowitz's quick survey of recent popular Jewish violence against Palestinians or symbols of Palestinian nationalism (e.g., Palestinian flags or images of Yasser Arafat) reveals a startling coincidence with Purim. The most chilling example, juxtaposed against a 1993 photograph of a hasidic boy in Me'ah She'arim follow ing the Torah reading for Purim morning using a plastic AK-47 as a pointer, is Baruch Goldstein's attack on Muslim worshippers in a mosque in Hebron, spraying them with AK-47 fire and killing about thirty. Although Muslims remember the event as having occurred during the holy month of Ramadan, Horowitz reminds us that the 1994 attack took place, according to the Jewish calendar, at the begin ning of Purim. A startling coincidence, or something more? Horowitz's account of contemporary Purim violence suggests to him a not so-coincidental link to earlier acts of ritualized aggression occurring on (or about) Purim, with medieval and modem examples drawn from accounts of Jewish anti Christian offenses. In the first part of this book, Horowitz provides a historiogra phical survey of the book of Esther, its often troubled reception in both Jewish and Christian communities, and the Purim festival that developed from it. He examines Purim as an occasion on which Jews from the fifth to the twenty-first centuries have expressed their animosity in transgressive behaviors. Sometimes inflamed by the reading of the megillah, which depicts a threatened Jewish community that achieves victory over its enemies, and by the effects of intoxication (Horowitz reminds us that the Talmud exhorts Jews to "become so drunk on Purim that one could not distinguish between cursing Haman and blessing Mordecai"), otherwise circumspect Jews may have committed acts of ritualized violence against the Christian majority. Though most of the sources containing accounts of Jewish violence are well known to historians, many Jewish historians and their Christian counterparts, Hor owitz shows, have sought to subvert these accounts. For centuries, Christians developed and transmitted the myth of the effeminate, timorous (though resentful) Jew in order to confirm their own reading of Jewish history, a reading rooted in a Christian triumphalism that understood Jews as condemned by God to perpetual servitude, weakness, and inferiority. As a result, Christian sources have tended to depict Jewish violence as a cowardly attack against Christian symbols (the cross and the crucifix) or against Christian children (e.g., in ritual murder accusa tions), the weakest members of Christian society. At the same time, many modem (and not only anti-Zionist) Jewish histor ians, having accepted as a sign of moral superiority the premise of Jewish passivity and repugnance for violence, have cast doubt on the reliability of such accounts. Yet in the book of Esther, the story of Mordecai, a Jew with an "attitude," celebrates a very different type of behavior. Mordecai's example, according to Horowitz, rarely shaped normative Jewish conduct, "except ... on the very day on which his story was read?the holiday of Purim" (69). In Purim festivities everywhere, in the figure of the archenemy Haman, every enemy of the Jews could be symbolically, and sometimes not only symbolically, vanquished. 366</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Whereas the first part of this book explores the book of Esther and Purim, in the second part, Horowitz rums especially to evidence of a Jewish assault on med ieval and early modem Christianity. Dozens of Christian texts allege, and some Jewish chronicles confirm, that Jews occasionally attacked the most sacred symbols of Christianity or that, in a few instances, they perpetrated religiously motivated violence against Christians themselves. Perhaps the weakest part of Horowitz's argument stems from the fact that abuses of Christian religious symbols occurred not only during Purim but also around Passover and Easter or Shavuot and Ascension Day. Although this expands the scope of the Jewish "legacy of violence" well past Purim, Horowitz suggests that "spring fever" arising from an intensifying liturgical calendar may help explain the clustering of charges of Jewish violence in this period. Typically, Jewish (and some non Jewish) historians have assumed that accusations of Jewish violence had no basis in reality. In Christendom, where Jews represented a small minority, attacks on Christians and Christian symbols could only be self-destructive. Jews, some historians have assumed, had a better sense of self-preservation. Such accounts, then, must instead project irrational Christian fears of the Jewish minority and represent one aspect of Christian antisemitism. But Horowitz subjects the historians' comfortable assumption to scrutiny. He shows that our sources seem to provide real evidence of occasional, religiously motivated Jewish violence against both Christians and their symbols. Although Hor owitz has been criticized for unearthing only "three reported Christian deaths at the hands of Jews in the course of history,"1 calling into question the reality of a "legacy of Jewish violence," the real story here is that in spite of the heavy retribution such violence elicited from the majority culture, Jewish violence should appear at all. Reckless Rites is a provocative volume, rich in historical detail. Horowitz tells a story, not without humor, that attempts to connect events of the distant past with contemporary conflicts. Unusual for a work of history, Reckless Rites is also a good read. Irven M. Resnick University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Chattanooga, Tennessee</page></plain_text>
