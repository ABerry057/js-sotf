Leiden: Brill, 2001. ix, 221 pp. This is an interesting, well-written and important study, relevant to anyone in- terested in better understanding metaphor in the Bible, figurative language, or idol- atry. David Aaron, Professor of Bible at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, was trained in rabbinics and linguistics at Brandeis Uni- versity; this training offers him a certain sensitivity to how language, especially what many would consider figurative language, functions. Thus, the book really deals with the importance of understanding semantics for interpretation. The core claim of the book is that most statements that biblical scholars con- sider to be metaphorical are not metaphorical. Aaron depicts this first by critiquing a common "binary" view of language, which views all utterances as either literal or metaphorical, and assumes that words' meanings are determined by "ontologi- cal identity," that is, necessary and sufficient features that adhere to the word it- self. Instead, following the Brandeis University linguist Ray Jackendorff, Aaron speaks of "typicality conditions" (p. 77), noting that indeterminacy and fuzziness are part of human language (p. 76). Though certain words may be clearly defined, e.g. scientific words by the scientific community, most words from the general per- spective are like "dog"-"We know a 'dog' when we see one" (p. 74). Not all linguists agree with this notion of semantics. However, as Aaron cor- rectly notes, this notion has an important implication: it suggests that there is not a binary opposition between literal and metaphorical language, but, rather, a gra- dient. Thus, most scholars incorrectly overextend the concept of metaphor, ignor- ing natural semantic fields of words (p. 110). Biblical images like "God is king" belong in this gradient, and should not be considered metaphorical, because they do not require what James Fernandez suggests metaphors require: "a stretch of the imagination" (p. 61). According to Aaron, "'metaphor' should be saved for a more distinctive rhetorical strategy, one that involves a process or decoding and map- ping" (p. 111). He also develops a criterion for suggesting when we have a true metaphor (pp. 101-123), and makes it quite clear that scholars have exaggerated the extent of metaphorical God-talk in the Bible for several reasons, including mis- understanding the nature of metaphor, having anachronistic biases about the bib- lical text; and treating the Bible too much as a unity. The latter points are certainly correct; the former will depend on whether the linguistic perspective of Jack- endorff is compelling. The concluding chapters deal predominantly with idolatry, aniconism, and the ark as an icon. He correctly observes that too many scholars accept Deutero- Isaiah's depiction of idolatry as normative for the entire Bible. He suggests that the ark originally had an iconic status in early Israel, and that groups in Israel treated (an)iconism in particular ways not for theological reasons, as most scholars sug- gest, but for a combination of social and political reasons, mostly related to the as- 313</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews sumption of Aaronide priests to power and their control of which icons were per- mitted (pp. 185-192). This suggestion has some merit, but may be criticized as one of a group of suggestions heard now in biblical studies that views religious de- velopments as purely political. (For example, centralization of worship as depict- ed in Deuteronomy 12 is seen by some as only an attempt by the royal powers to consolidate power in Jerusalem.) The importance of politics in religion should not be minimized, but it seems foolish to understand all significant religious develop- ments such that "It probably all comes down to politics and control" (p. 192). It is odd that Aaron is so attracted to this position, since elsewhere he eschews widely held modern notions such as the indeterminacy of textual meaning (pp. 4-7). The major contribution of the book is the suggestion that scholars have over- stated significantly the extent of metaphorical God-talk in the Bible. How correct Aaron is depends on whether his/Jackendorff's theory of language is correct. His notion of a "gradient" is attractive; and his observation that ". .. gods differed from humans ... not in absolute terms, but in degrees" (p. 193) is well argued. It would have been helpful, however, to see whether this general theory resulted in a differ- ent or better understanding of certain utterances such as "God is king" or "God is father," which others have analyzed as metaphorical. Given the highly technical linguistic issues that are presented, the book is quite clear. It is unfortunate, however, that it took over five years to bring to press, so it is not up to date bibliographically. It also ignores some earlier, basic works (e.g., pp. 160-162, wherein a discussion of lyla meaning "gods" does not refer to the same conclusions in the Koehler-Baumgartner Hebrew andAramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament). There are a fair number of typographical errors in the Hebrew (e.g., p. 58, which has n-n' for the Tetragrammaton), and in other foreign languages (e.g., 173 n. 48, where the "d," the determinative for deities in Akkadian, should ap- pear as a superscript). In some cases the bibliography and the notes do not match (e.g., p. 62 refers to Levenson 1993a, but in the bibliography, there is only a Lev- enson 1993). These are relatively minor concerns, however, and do not interfere with the clear and often witty prose used to outline this important problem.
