New York: New York University Press, 1993. xii, 234 pp. Over the last decade, our knowledge of Jewish women, as women and as Jews, has been greatly enhanced by an ever growing number of studies. Drawn from a variety of academic disciplines and reflecting a wide range of personal and religious perspectives, these works have included as their focus such topics as women's roles and status in rabbinic Judaism, women's own understanding of Jewish spirituality and of self and communal identity, Jewish women's literature, organizations created by and for women, struggles for change, exceptional women previously "written out of history," and so on. What Adrienne Baker proposes to add to the discussion are specific answers to the question: "What does it mean to be Jewish?" In so doing, she tries to show, as her introduction makes clear, ways in which one's answer necessarily reflects both the collective history and memory of the Jewish people and the contemporary culture in which one lives. By listening to the voices of Jewish women themselves, she sets out to examine "how women are influenced by and simultaneously influence the age-old culture of which.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 273 .. they are a part" (p. 2) as both internal and external forces give way to new ideas and ways of thinking that become "gradually heard, discussed, reflected upon and partly incorporated" (p. 3) into women's lives. Focusing on two specific contemporary Jewish communities, Great Britain and the United States, Baker's chapters begin with a broad overview of such topics as Jewish immigration, women's role in Judaism, religious law, Orthodoxy, marriage, childbearing, and sexuality. Thus, for example, her first chapter, entitled "Setting the Scene," does not specifically focus on women, but on a variety of factors which have influenced the experiences of American and British Jews. These include the experience of being an immigrant vs. being native-born, the influence of Ashkenazi or Sephardi culture, the demographic makeup of each community, adaptation to the host culture, Jewish religious movements, marriage and divorce rates, and the annual rate of emigration. Similarly, the subsequent chapters--each of which has as its express purpose an examination of some aspect of women and Judaism--spend a great deal of time establishing an historical, sociological, legal, and/or theological context for the topic under consideration. "The Religious Scene," for instance, includes several pages on each of the major Jewish religious movements in the United States and Great Britain, from their inception through today, a lengthy discussion of the role of private and public ritual in contemporary Jewish life, and a description of concerns central to secular Jews, before explicitly raising the question, in the chapter's final six pages, of how some contemporary women have answered the question: "What does it mean to you, being Jewish?" Baker's insistence that any discussion of women and Judaism be placed within a particular context serves as an important corrective to earlier works, particularly those in Women's Studies, that tended to universalize the experi- ences of women. Indeed, her work rightly underscores, though implicitly, the importance of context in studying any Jewish community and in characterizing the nature of Jewish religious life. Yet despite its value, Baker's The Jewish Woman in Contemporary Society at times offers too much context and too little reflection. While those who have done little reading in the areas that she discusses should appreciate Baker's survey of "the literature" (i.e., previously written studies), others may wish that she had relied less heavily on secondary sources and offered critical evaluation of what the sources suggest. Too, the book contains several historical inaccuracies, the most glaring of which are in its description of Liberal Judaism in England (surprising in light of the fact that Baker herself is British). Nonetheless, those interested in contemporary</page><page sequence="3">274 BOOK REVIEWS Jewish feminism will find Baker's book well worth reading, for it is the only work to date that devotes significant attention to women's calls for change within the Anglo-Jewish community. Recent works on Jewish feminism have primarily focused on Israel and/or the United States. Especially noteworthy are Barbara Swirski and Marilyn P. Safir's Calling the Equality Bluff Women in Israel (New York: Pergamon Press, 1991) and Sylvia Barack Fishman's A Breath ofLife: Feminism in the American Jewish Community (New York: Free Press, 1993), which looks at much of the same material as Baker with greater insight and detail. Yet, as Baker's book so clearly shows, Anglo-Jewish women have not been immune to the influences of feminism. Elucidating her points with quotations from and brief interviews with a wide variety of Jewish women, she describes ways in which the changing expectations and struggles of Anglo-Jewish women are both like, and unlike, those of women in the United States. Certainly, as Baker rightly recognizes, there is no single answer to "how Jewish women can use . . . learn from and become part of the struggles and doubts and achievements of feminist women" (p. 215). Yet as her book clearly shows, there are a wide variety of ways in which contemporary Jewish women in the United States and Britain already are seeking, renegotiating, and attempting to find new meaning in Judaism as a way of thought and a way of life.
