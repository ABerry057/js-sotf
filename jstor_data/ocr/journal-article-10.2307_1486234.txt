<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A WORD FOR MY BLOOD:" A READING OF KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" (VILNA, 1927) by KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN In her autobiography, My Great-Grandfather's Inheritance, the Yiddish poet Kadya Molodowsky (1893/94-1975) recalled her feeling upon publish- ing her first book of poetry, Kheshvandike nekht ("Nights of Heshvan") in 1927. Although this was my first book, I didn't feel like a beginner. A book is a book. For me, writing poems was first and foremost speaking from the heart. Days I was occupied with [teaching] school. I wrote the poems mostly at night. The poverty of the Jewish population, the limitations on Jewish livelihood lay heavy on my heart, and writing the poems, I often shed a tear. The occasion of my book was not a celebration for me, but a kind of easing up, a kind of unloading. At that time I composed a poem that began with these lines: 11KV1' J'K t1 'I~b~31~llP I33~ I don't write a poem, I try 47</page><page sequence="2">48 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN To find a word for my blood That cries in my body.' In public terms, Molodowsky's literary career was extraordinarily suc- cessful, especially for a woman writing poetry in Yiddish.2 Her first book was accepted immediately by the renowned Vilna publisher B. Kletskin and well received with some twenty reviews in Poland and America.3 Such recog- nition continued throughout her life. She was awarded prizes for her numerous books of poems, short stories, plays, novels. In her later years, she founded and edited Sviva, an influential literary journal. Despite her outward literary successes, Molodowsky's work as a woman poet was deep- ly conflicted, caught in what one critic has called "the double bind of the woman poem."4 Molodowsky's early books of poems5 in particular are 1.

Reciprocally, a reading of Molodowsky's poems may enrich the vocabulary for the study of women to describe the experience of women who emerged from traditional Judaism by writing poetry in a Jewish language, Yiddish. An anecdote from her autobiography illustrates the conflict Molodowsky perceived between the work of women as mothers and as writers. A certain woman once brought her son to see Molodowsky, because he admired her children's mayselekh, or tales.9 The boy apparently expected to find the poet enthroned on a golden chair, and "all the joyous events that occur in her mayselekh would be seen around her in the house."'0 Instead, he saw Molodowsky at her mending, and, as the mother later told her, complained, "She darns socks! Just like you!" From this child's point of view, a writer of tales and poems should not act like a mother. Molodowsky responded, "When I write, I sit on a golden chair, but when I finish writing, the golden chair flies off and I'm left darning socks!" Molodowsky's whimsical distinction between the two occupations of a woman writer-upon the throne of the imagination and in the stitches of quotidian tasks-indicates a serious dichotomy between writing and woman's work that contradicts the notion of poetry as an organic entity, as the "words for my blood." As this contrast suggests, Molodowsky's poems attempt to reconcile a struggle between a romantic notion of poetry that privileges a woman creator and the socially ordained roles that limit her on account of her gender. Although the poet and the woman are mutually embodied, Molodowsky's early books play out the irreconcilability of these two kinds of creativity, and a later poem, "Mayne kinder" ("My Chil- dren"), expresses directly the consequences of a poet's choice between Metaphor," pp. 49-50; Margaret Homans, Bearing the Word: Language and Female Experience in Nineteenth-Century Women's Writing (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp. 1-39; Cixous, "The Laugh of the Medusa," The Signs Reader, p. 283. 9. The Yiddish word mayse comes from the Hebrew root for "deed" or "act." According to Alexander Harkavy, Yidish-english-hebreyish verterbukh, 3d ed. (New York: Hebrew Publish- ing Co., 1928), pp. 310-311: the first meaning in Yiddish is "deed, act, occurrence"; the second meaning is "tale, story." Within this meaning, there is a third denotation, "thing, matter," which leads to the fourth, slang meaning of "female genital organ." Although this slang usage is hardly the first association a reader would have with the title of verse for children, its very exis- tence suggests an implicit, powerful connection between the acts of telling stories and of reproduction. As the title of Molodowsky's children's poems, mayselekh connotes the fantastic, folklike quality of these narrative poems. Also see Nahum Stutchkoff, Der oytser fun der yidisher shprakh, ed.

The speaker's four unborn children surround her in the night, and the first son demands of her: l_'1311 P*T ,713._' P p~n l,, n~; oyms Why did you not deliver my share, The one decreed, the one ordered for me- Into your world of fears and music? What good are all your songs, the melodies and the choruses? Since beneath them our withered souls LANGUISH?" This complaint of the unborn children drives home to the poet how irrever- sible is a woman's choice of imagination over procreation. In the autobiographical passage previously quoted, Molodowsky describes the act of writing poetry as finding "a word for my blood." In this charged phrase, the metaphor emphasizes the correspondence in Molo- dowsky's imagination between the act of writing poems and the biological function of her body. Poetry becomes the occasion for finding a word to articulate the essential fluid of life itself. Significantly, this trope appears in writings by women in many languages in the latter half of this century. For example, Sylvia Plath, in 1962, uses the figure negatively to describe the pre- dicament of a woman who cancreate, it seems, neither children nor words. While her barren womb "Rattles its pod," this woman, "Spiderlike, ... spin [s] mirrors, / ... Uttering nothing but blood."'2 In contrast, the French writer Helene Cixous, in a positive figure, depicts the blood of menses as the medium for fertility, providing the basis for a peculiarly female creativity in words: " . . . all these drives are our strengths, and among them is the gesta- 11.

After Cain kills Abel, God accuses Cain, "What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground" (Gen. 4:10).14 Although here Abel's blood itself seems to speak to God, in the next verse, the grammatically feminine ground, ha-adamah, which has "received" this blood, is said to curse the murderer whose hands have shed it: "And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand" (Gen. 4:11). This passage plots a contrary causality for blood and words. At first the blood itself appears both to command words and to con- vey the instrument for speech-a mouth-to the ground that has absorbed it. The following verse then proceeds to transpose the powers, as the blood itself comes to seem voiceless, while the earth possesses a mouth, through which it gives voice to the spilled blood. It is possible to understand the passage in yet another way. Perhaps neither blood nor earth possess the capacity for speech until the blood falls on the earth for the first time; at that moment, the earth acquires a mouth and the blood a voice, which together articulate the silent message of fratricide. In this reading of the figure, the earth, by absorbing Abel's blood, reverses Eve's birthing in Genesis 4:1-2: Abel's life descends into the earth, as it once emerged from the mother's body. The feminine earth corresponds to the female Eve. Only as the murdered son's blood returns to its maternal source do the accusing words form themselves. As Molodowsky casts this figure, the poet's blood cries in her body like Abel's blood crying from the earth. The allusion shows how radically the modern writer has altered the biblical figure. Unlike Abel's blood crying out to God for retribution, the poet's blood cries inwardly to a self who can only attempt to find a word to represent that cry. In context, the poet's blood corresponds to the injustice of poverty and hunger. Her blood cries in her body like "The march of torn shoes" which "on sheets of white paper / Writes with dark strokes.""' The poem from which these lines come, 13.

While the poet intends to express empathy for others, the figures subvert this political gesture, and a struggle ensues. This struggle between outward and inward directives, between the didactic intention and the figurative lan- guage of the poem, mirrors the conflict in the woman poet between the tra- ditional female roles and the subversive role of the imagination. In this paper, I will study how gender figures in the language of one sequence, "Froyen-lider," from Kadya Molodowsky's first book, Kheshven- dike nekht ("Nights of Heshvan"). The speaker in the twelve poetic sequences of Kheshvandike nekht places herself in difrie mitl-yorn fun a froy, "the early-middle years of a woman."'6 She moves through the landscape of Jewish eastern Europe as a modern woman in a variety of roles: a teacher, a traveler, a lover, an empathetic observer of "all impoverished women who scour burnt pots."'7 Throughout the book, this persona contrasts her own modernity with the roles for women decreed by Jewish tradition, either halakhically, that is, legally, or by custom and history. For Molodowsky, however, the conflict between a traditionally defined female identity and creativity is embodied in figurative language and poetic forms that reveal a peculiarly Jewish intertextual struggle. The very title of the sequence "Froyen-lider" exemplifies this problema- tic.'8 This title consists of two nouns, hyphenated in the original text, with a typographical mark that resembles an equal sign: Froyen=lider, "Women= Poems." In this formulation, one noun seems to modify the other, but the problem arises in how to read the equation between the two nouns. Does the title translate as "Poems of Women," i.e., poems about women, or "Women's Poems," i.e., poems belonging to women? Typographically, the appearance of an equation might even suggest that women are poems, and poems, women. This ambiguity points to the central problem of "Froyen- lider": how can the woman writer reconcile her art with the culturally dic- tated, specifically Jewish precepts of womanhood? Before tracing the ways Molodowsky works out this problem in "Froyen-lider," it is worthwhile to describe the sequence as a whole. Six of 16.

Her solitude and nocturnal dreams, thoughts, and visions provide the occa- sion for her words. At the beginning, she dreams of generations of her female ancestors, while at the end, she has a vision of her deceased mother. In the middle, the speaker reflects upon the consequences of her illicit inti- macy with a man, or perhaps with two men. Then follow two poems in which there is no explicit "I," and which address the generalized situations of women who, married or longing to marry, barren or pregnant, find com- fort in the order of Jewish belief and the course of nature. In contrast to these women, the speaker herself remains ambivalent, estranged from the familiar comforts and resisting the powerful draw of the tradition. Imagery of the seasons prepares for an uneasy closure: the expected progression of nature is disordered, as the narrative leaps from autumn to summer to spring to autumn. The sequence begins, in "Froyen-lider I," as the speaker narrates her dream of the women in her family. ,Ii_" ~l "fq' 13 'c Y7Y? l.'.a n)P a 1'K 'T"; "l'3 The women of our family will come to me in dreams at night and say: In virtue we carried a pure blood through the generations, We brought it to you, like a guarded wine in kosher cellars</page><page sequence="9">KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" 55 Of our hearts. And one will say: I was left an abandoned wife when my cheeks were Two reddish apples still on the tree And I clenched my white teeth in the lonely nights of expectation. And I will go to meet the grandmothers, saying: The withered melodies of your lives Chase after me like autumn winds.

In the first four lines, the speaker's female forebears announce across the generations the inheritance they have bequeathed to her. This inheri- tance is "the pure blood" of family lineage, preserved and passed on like kosher wines, appropriate for the commanded ritual blessing of wine, Kid- dush. Through the simile of wine, blood itself is likened to the virtue inherent in a ritually correct way of living. Contradictorily, though, this same blood of women also suggests the impure blood of menstruation and childbirth, for which the laws of issue, Niddah,19 provide sexual restrictions and the means of ritual purification. This connotation is developed later in the poem, in the phrase dos blut on a tumah ("this blood without an impurity," line 15), for tumah denotes especially the "Levitical uncleanness"20 of the laws of Niddah. The simile of wine, then, indicates two opposing interpreta- tions of blood: the pure blood kept by the ancestresses in tsnies, in chaste modesty or virtue, is also, when conveyed through women's bodies, the blood of menses and procreation that makes a woman impure. As these female progenitors appear in the dream, their words place a burden on the 19.

In lines 5-8, one of them, an agunah, speaks. An agunah, an abandoned wife who cannot remarry until her husband either is proven dead or grants her a divorce, epitomizes the woman caught in a bind, or literally "anchored" by law to a husband whose existence is ambiguous.21 The an- cestral agunah in this poem represents the obedient woman, a victim of her husband's circumstance, who sacrifices her female ripeness for the sake of conforming to the Law. This sacrifice is figured in the metaphor of cheeks as "reddish apples." Defiantly, the poem's speaker resists this example of vir- tue. Unlike the agunah, she will not grit her white teeth through lonely nights of expectation. The speaker's defiance is especially clear in a subse- quent poem, "Froyen-lider II," which provides the information that she has disobeyed the laws prohibiting adulterous sex by taking lovers. In this first poem, though, a hint of rebellion, albeit less forthright rebellion, is also con- veyed, in line 9, as the speaker announces, as if to the agunah, that she will confront those grandmothers of past generations who threaten to restrict her. This confrontation, though, is undermined by what comes next in the poem: the lives of the grandmothers pursue her in all dark places. The figures with which these lives are depicted-withered melodies and autumn winds-are the meager legacy of obedient chastity's restraints. These images take on a peculiar power against the active, sexually seeking, unchaste, modern woman. In lines 9-14, the overall anapestic rhythm, which pre- viously ranged from two to seven stresses per line, becomes insistently uni- form. Lines 9-11 scan in four beats, with varying arrangements of iambs and anapests. In contrast, lines 12-14 scan identically. In contrast, lines 12-14 scan identically. -/ -I- . 21.

The words with which the speaker refers to the generations of women marks a progression. The progression moves from the common Yiddish word froyen in line 1, denoting both woman and wife, to the technical Hebraic term for an abandoned wife, agunah, in line 6, to bobes, grand- mothers, in line 9, a word of Slavic origin, which places the speaker at a generational remove from the lives of these women. In contrast to these three names for women, all of which connote relationship to a husband, the speaker names herself as ikh, defined only in terms of her relation to her mothers. With bobes the poet indicates the speaker's increasing impatience with the old-fashioned strains of the nigunim, devotional melodies, which their lives represent to her. Melodic as the nigunim may be, their music is as dry as dead leaves to the speaker. The speaker concludes the poem with a question that challenges the vali- dity of the past ways of women for the woman in the present: "And why shall this blood without impurity / Be my conscience, like a silken thread / Bound on my brain... ?" The blood, like the winds and melodies, is too insubstantial to bind physically, yet it constricts the speaker's brain (moyekh) like a silken thread, tough and delicate at once. Through the simile likening blood to a thread, the blood itself paradoxically cuts off circulation and yet binds together (farbunden) the speaker's sense of herself as a woman. This self-contradicting simile exemplifies the tension in Molodowsky's "Froyen-lider" between words and woman and offers a gloss for her defini- tion of a poem as "words for my blood." The binding thread also suggests the tfillin which a man binds to his brow and left forearm with leather thongs. If tfillin bind a man to God in his prayer, the silken thread on this woman's brain binds her restrictively to a tradition she no longer believes in.22 The last two lines present an image that keeps the speaker caught in this paradox: the speaker sees herself as de- Testament, reprint based on the Lexicon of William Gesenius, trans.

The binding image somewhat enigmatically suggests the Yom Kippur Avodah, where the scarlet thread was bound around the horn of the scapegoat released by the high priest into the wilderness. This thread miraculously turns white when the sins of the community are for- given.</page><page sequence="12">58 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN scended from the past generations of women, and yet is alienated, literally plucked out from them. And my life a page plucked from a holy book, The first line torn? This metaphor renders the speaker's life as part and parcel of the Hebrew holy book, sefer, by which the generations of women lived, obedient to the ancient laws and restrictions. Yet her life is torn from the common binding and made impure. We may complete the logic of these figures: if blood is a thread and life is a book, then the cutting of the silken thread looses the page from its binding and lets the blood from the body. This double release should imply deracination and death. Instead, the letting of tsniesdike blut allows for the desires of the body to assert themselves against the text that has restrained them. At once the speaker experiences loss and release. The Hebraic word sefer ("holy book") in the penultimate line of the poem refers the reader back to the other Hebraic words in the poem, kosher, agunah, tsnies, tumah. The sefer itself is the book from which these words of sexual restriction come, the text to which the nigun, or melody, of the women's lives is set. The figure of the sefer page makes the speaker's life a part of the written Hebraic tradition of sexuality that binds women's desires. The speaker's life, still composed of the traditional text, has been ripped from its context, and the first line of holy writing is damaged, farrisn.23 The page of her life, inscribed in Hebrew but torn from its binding, needs a new book into which to be set. With this, Molodowsky justifies the Yiddish poems before us. The metaphor of the speaker's life as text submerges in the four central poems of the sequence and resurfaces in the last three poems. The central poems, "Froyen-lider" II, III, IV, and V, advance the narrative of the sequence by chronicling the sexual license of the speaker. And their meta- phors link images from traditional Jewish texts to the woman's body. Her 23. The exact meaning offarrisn is ambiguous here.

I will come to the one Who first brought me woman's delight, And say: Man, I trusted yet another with my quiet gaze, And one night lay my head near him. Now I bring my sorrow Like bees stinging around my heart, And have no honey to soothe the hurt. And if the man takes me by the braid, I will drop to my knees And remain on the doorstep like the petrifaction at Sodom, I will raise my hands to my head like my mother blessing the Sabbath candles, But my fingers will stand rigid like ten numbered sins. The imagery of gesture in "Froyen-lider II" reverses expectations or tra- ditional meanings. In the first eight lines, the speaker tells how she will return to her first lover, seeking his "honey" as a salve for the bee-sting hurt caused by the other man. His response will be "to take me by the braid," an ambiguous gesture of sexual possession and punishment. The speaker then narrates her own gesture of contrition in lines 11-14. This gesture is complicated by the twofold simile that refers to a dis-</page><page sequence="14">60 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN obedient woman's punishment in the Torah and to an obedient woman's custom in daily life. In the first instance, the speaker kneels like Lot's wife turned to salt at Sodom (Genesis 19:26); in the second, she raises her hands as her mother used to do when she blessed the Sabbath candles. The first instance recalls the salt pillar-a symbol of divine punishment of a woman who looked back at the destruction of sin; the second recalls the symbolic gesture of a woman who refrains from looking at the illumination of peace. Lighting the Sabbath candles, the mother fulfilled one of the three positive mitsvot required of Jewish women. Yet her obedience extended further, with the significant gesture of covering her eyes. Customarily a benediction is recited before an act is performed, but the blessing over the candles marks the beginning of the Sabbath, during which Jews are forbidden to create light. In order both to satisfy the requirement of reciting the blessing before the act and to avoid transgressing the Sabbath, the mother would first light the candles, but then cover her eyes so as not to see the flames while she recited the blessing. When she finished, she would remove her hands and look upon the light, thus symbolically allowing the benediction to precede the act.24 Like Lot's wife, who dies looking back at what she has left, the speaker in "Froyen-lider II," petrified on the doorstep, is unable to see in the past any consolation for her present sorrows. The language of line 12 replaces the flesh and blood of Lot's wife with her metamorphosis into salt: di farshteynerung fun sdom names not the woman, but what she becomes.25 The word farshteynerung is a gerund that denotes both the process of turning to stone (shteyn) and the thing petri- fied.26 Like the process of petrification, where stone replaces organic matter, in the poetic line this word stands in place of the woman who underwent that transformation. Yet the familiar, idiomatic language that conveys the mother's habitual piety brings the image of a living woman back into the poem. Indeed, the speaker fuses both these images in the final line. Unlike 24.

Her living fingers "stand" (shteyn), punning on the word far- shteynerung, as if rigid and no longer human, like the bloodless pillar of salt. The ten fingers enumerate her sinful passions, as if she had broken the Ten Commandments one by one. The gesture of the mother's obedience, then, is transformed by the poem into an attestation to the daughter's disobedience. "Froyen-lider III" makes the metaphor of stone literal in the narrative setting. The speaker tells how she, having returned to her former lover, sleeps on the stone doorstep. Sometimes a stone step is sweet as a pillow, So I stretch out on its coldness When I can't bear up to the third floor My head with its thin dry lips. Then I am a silent, fainting girl, Who shuffles across the ground on numb feet And lies down somewhere Alone all night on the s stone stairs. This speaker is the opposite of an agunah, for she is not imprisoned in chas- tity by the words of the Law, but shut out of the protecting walls of the home through her own chosing, because she has been unchaste. As deprivation transforms cold stone into a pillow's sweetness, her venture into womanly passion, mayn froyen freyd (F.L. II, 1), has reduced her to a motherless meydl, or girl. "Froyen-lider III" suggests that it is not an outer world that punishes her but her own weakness. Her silence compounds this physical weakness, for words impart the power to act.</page><page sequence="16">62 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN "Froyen-lider IV" reconfirms the solitude of the speaker of "Froyen- lider III." The speaker is alone with herself in her room. Even her own image in the mirror is too much to bear. ,-m - 7y,,m1 "',' ,3'N "I'3 1' 5t 011 I must turn the mirror aside, So that now, in the still night, my face Does not look at me with prim lips: I will no longer consider what I have not before considered. I will nod my head to the wall, As if to a living person who is sorry, As if to an old, good friend. In the still of the night it is all the same Whether I am right or wrong. My brows are heavy and still not unburdened, And my limbs gravitate to the earth In mute trust of her primordial conscience. In this poem, the speaker comes to accept her actions. The walls of her room take on human presence. The earth itself, grammatically feminine in Yiddish as in Hebrew, draws the speaker's physical being and offers her consolation. In fact, the feminine earth, with the connotations of life and death in the image of gravitation, suggests the earth that absorbs Abel's blood and curses Cain in Genesis 4:10. In calling the earth's "conscience" primordial, the speaker acknowledges that it is older than the Laws she has transgressed and summoned forth for her own punishment in the preceding poems. Molo- dowsky here places in opposition the forces of culture and nature as they act upon a woman.</page><page sequence="17">KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" 63 "Froyen-lider V" ends the narrative section on the speaker's passion and its consequences, that is, her solitude and attempt at self-knowledge. She narrates a scence of her insomnia in the summer dawn. Long and mild are the dawns of Tammuz and Av, When I hold my wakeful head on a brown, sunburned hand: Man, I have kept near me a guarded place for you, But I have not kept any peace and place for myself. Through closed eyes the tears fall slow and warm, And stillness spreads, Like small drowsy rabbits around the bed, Soon the day will make its first cry And they will scatter And I will rise to my difficult, long way. Although "Froyen-lider V" is slight, and essentially provides closure for the narrative of the central poems, the language recalls and anticipates the rest of the sequence. Night of the earlier poems has become dawn, and autumn, summer. The previous, densely symbolic gesture of hands raised to the head has evolved into a simple physical posture, as the head rests on a hand. The lovely metaphor of drowsy rabbits around the bed ameliorates the previous metaphor of bees stinging around the heart. As in the second poem, the speaker in "Froyen-lider V" addresses a "Man," her contender and absent lover. In both poems, the very word man dominates a short line, set off from</page><page sequence="18">64 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN the other lines. Whereas in the second poem, the speaker predicts the judg- mental actions of this man, in the fifth poem, he is but a listening presence made "other" by his maleness. The speaker seems to have gained power from her confrontation with female specters of the past and her sexual unions in the present. These engagements seem to have taught her the hard necessities of the self. In "Froyen-lider I," the generations of women preserved their blood like "a guarded wine," a vayn a gehitn, for their descendant. In "Froyen-lider V," the speaker keeps "a guarded place," an ort an opgehitn, near herself for the man, at the expense of guarding or cherishing "some peace and place for" herself, far mir hob ikh nit opgehit keyn ru un ort. By repeating the adjectives gehit and ophitn, and the verb ogehit, Molodowsky subtly draws attention to a religious meaning, "to observe holidays," that resonates throughout the sequence. This repetition unearths a metaphor of ritual observance. In the speaker's words, this concept changes, from literally obeying the legal restraints on the female body, to figuratively observing the rituals of a romantic love that stands outside of Jewish law. The speaker discovers, though, that she has only transferred the observance of ritual from one domain to another, each controlled by an authority or power implicitly male. As a result, she must continue on her "difficult, long way," to seek a "place," or to observe a ritual for herself. Molodowsky returns to the question of text and life, word and blood. By modeling "Froyen-lider VI" on a type of devotional text, and replacing the subjective "I" with a narrator, she develops the speaker's predicament in collective terms. The poem alludes to the tkhines, Yiddish prayers composed for (and some, it is thought, by) women. It follows the general form of those tkhines appealing to the matriarchs, such as "Tehinnah of the Matriarchs for Rosh Hodesh Elul," composed by Serel bas Jacob Halevi Segal of Dubno, and published in 1783 in Frankfurt-am-Oder, as quoted by Israel Zinberg.27 In this tkhine, women would appeal to the biblical matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, to provide merit for protecting their "sinful homeless children." First we beg our mother Sarah that she may pray for us at the hour of judg- ment, that we may go out free from the judgment.... Have mercy, our 27.

You know well that it is very bitter when a child is taken away from its mother, how it was with you, how grieved you were when they took your Isaac away from you.28 Rather than addressing the matriarchs in a prayer, Molodowsky's poem narrates their compassion for the humbled and ordinary woman. It is signi- ficant that the speaker narrates, rather than prays, for by narrating a prayer she calls into question the efficacy of praying. ,tuna -b t7 ' -1 YY m Y'7i21t ~fDY 'TD;a u1 tp~ 28.

Molodowsky establishes an ironic parallelism between this, the sixth, and the first poem in the sequence. As her ancestral specters "came" to the speaker, bearing their pure blood "like a guarded wine," so the biblical matriarchs appear to the many unhappy women. Yet her mothers' gift bur- dened the speaker, restricting and angering her, while the matriarchs' gifts offer genuine comfort to the women. Mother Sarah comes to "poor brides who were servant girls" with either full pitchers of sparkling wine or small goblets of her tears, as God has decreed. Sarah also appears to prostitutes who dream of marriage, bearing honey, as if to sweeten the unlikelihood that their dreams will be fulfilled. Mother Rebecca brings to the "highborn brides," whose ragged dowries humble them before their mothers-in-law, fine linens that will reinstate their standing. The matriarch Rachel, who had trouble conceiving and "bore Jacob no children" (Genesis 30:1) until "God opened her womb and she conceived and bore a son ... Joseph" (Genesis 30:22-24), carries to those who are barren exotic remedies and the hope that God will intervene for them as He did for her. Traditionally, when the tkhines address the matriarchs, Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel are summoned, and Leah is usually not.29 This fact is significant, for it points us toward the poem's ironic treatment of the so-called "feminine" sentimentality conventionally associated with the tkhines. The first three groups of suppliants to the matriarchs consist of brides, prosti- tutes, would-be brides, and barren wives. Like the list of women ancestors in "Froyen-lider I," all of these women are defined by their sexual relation- ship to men, whether legitimized or not. The fourth group of suppliants are unlike the others, and more like the speaker of "Froyen-Lider I." Appealing to the matriarch Leah, they are distinguished from the previously cata- logued women by their solitude. In Genesis, Leah, the unfavored, elder sister of Rachel, is the wife given in trickery to Jacob by Laban. Because she 29.

As a result, Leah bears Jacob seven children before Rachel can pro- duce her first (Genesis 29:31-30:25). In the biblical story, God gives Leah the power of fertility to counterbalance her husband's disdain for her. In Molodowsky's poem, however, the power of Leah is kept in by her silence (lines 35-36). The women Leah comforts, in contrast to the other matriarchs' charges, are characterized by their solitary verbal acts. These women weep alone and talk to themselves with parched lips (lines 32-34). The image of sorrow- ing women talking to themselves alludes to the barren Hannah, taken for a drunkard by Eli the priest when she petitioned God for a child, silently moving her lips and speaking in her heart (I Samuel 1:1-20). For Leah's charges there is no priest to intervene, and perhaps no God. This matriarch who seems to be their only witness, brings them her ambiguous presence--- silence and the gesture of her hands covering her eyes. The weakness of Leah's eyes is implied in Genesis in the initial descrip- tion of the sisters Rachel and Leah: "Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah and the younger was Rachel. And Leah's eyes were weak. But Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon." (Gene- sis 29:16-17). The Hebrew adjective rakot (translated here as "weak") can also be read as "tender," in the sense of gentle, delicate, soft. The Tse'ena Ure'ena translates rakot into Yiddish as veykh, "soft." Leah believes that as the eldest daughter she will have to marry Isaac's eldest son, Esau. un di oygn fun leye zenen geven veykh vayl zi hot zeyer geveynt [v]en di layt hobn gezogt leye iz di eltste tokhter fun lovn vet zi nemen eysov dem eltstn zun fun rivke un rokhl iz di yungste tokhter vet zi nemen yankev dem yungstn zun fun rivke darum hot leye zeyer geveynt biz zi hot bakumen shlekhte oygn fun fil veynen...30 In this version, Leah weeps so much at the thought of this badly decreed match that her eyes become veykh and shlekhte, "soft" and "terrible." Molodowsky's Leah covers her eyes in an enigmatic gesture. Whether she shields her eyes in modesy or weeps compassionately, Leah acknow- ledges the plight of these women by not witnessing it. Leah's gesture recalls 30.

There, that gesture connoted the contrast between the mother who obeyed and the speaker who flaunted Jewish law. Here, the matriarch, mother of mothers, covers her eyes in the face of a modern isolation that has no biblical precedent. This polysemous gesture joins the modern woman, the pious mother, and the matriarch. Molodowsky has modeled her poem on the tkhines of the matriarchs to explore how the Jewish texts can comfort women who fulfill no traditional female role. By ending the poem with Leah's mute gesture, Molodowsky indicates the ambiguity of such consola- tion. Like the preceding poem, "Froyen-lider VII" presents the predicament of the sequence's protagonist in collective terms. Whereas the sixth poem placed women who have no traditional role uneasily within the culture of devotion, the seventh poem puts them at the mercy of nature. The poem depicts the irrepressible procreative urge of the spring season as a force against which the childless woman has no defense.

And women come and lie down like sick sheep By wells to heal their bodies, And have dark faces From long years of thirsting for the cry of a child. These are the spring nights When lightning splits the black earth With silver slaughtering knives. And pregnant women approach White tables in the hospital with quiet steps And smile at the yet-unborn child And perhaps at the dead. These are the spring nights When up from under a stone, a grass blade pushes forth from the earth. In the first half of this poem (lines 1-9), the season's inevitable arrival corresponds to unstoppable growth, as grass pushes up from beneath a stone, moss covers the vestiges of death, a horse skull, and a woman craves the pain of childbirth. The parallelism in lines 2-5 establishes that this female desire is part of the natural order. Although she indicates that this desire is "natural," the poet attributes to it a paradoxical value. The subse- quent simile likens women who "lie down," as if for sex, to sick sheep that approach wells for a cure (lines 6-9). From the ambiguous syntax of these lines, it is hard to tell whether line 7, "By wells to heal their bodies," modi- fies "women," "sick sheep," or both. In the latter case, if both women in springtime and sheep that are ill literally lie down by wells for a cure, then the simile leads to the conclusion that the spring season incapacitates women as disease does sheep, and that women are as instinctual as sheep in seeking a cure. Why would women lie down by wells? Molodowsky's choice of the word krenitse ("well, spring"), rather than the common brunem ("well") or kval ("spring"), alludes to the biblical passages in which marriages are arranged by wells.3 Furthermore, the image of an opening deep into the earth that 31. In Harkavy, Yidish-english-hebreisher verterbukh, pp. 469, 133, the Hebrew transla- tion of krenitse is maeyon ("spring, fountain, source, well"), and the Hebrew translation of brunem is be-ar ("well, pit"). In the biblical story of Abraham's servant Eliezer, who secures Rebecca as Isaac's bride while watering the camels at the city well (Genesis 24:11-20), two</page><page sequence="25">KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" 71 reaches to the source of life suggests a metaphor for a vagina. This metaphor eroticizes the lying down of the women. Yet the eroticism is associated with imagery of animal death-the skull of a horse, the sick sheep-that counter- acts the forces of birth and growth. The image of the black faces of the women further develops the comparison to ewes and suggests the distortion of severe illness or devouring passion. A woman aching to bear a child, it seems, lies outside the bounds of nature and health. The poem appears to begin once again in the second half (lines 10-18), by repeating the construction of the initial lines. The imagery of spring is violent. The lightning, conveyed in a metaphor of the ritual slaughtering knives, khalofim, connects the women/sheep figure of the first half of the poem with the earth itself. The adjective shvartse ("black"), which refers both to the faces of the women (line 8) and to the earth (line 12), doubles the metaphor by repetition. The metaphor of the ritual slaughtering knives further intensifies this doubled metaphor. Not only are women like sheep with black faces, and they and the sheep like the black, fertile earth, but the earth split by lightning is like a sheep waiting to be slaughtered by khalofim. At the end of "Froyen-lider IV," the earth was personified as a female, with "her primordial conscience," toward which the speaker gravitated. Now, in "Froyen-lider VII," the earth, figured as a sheep at the slaughter, pivots the reader between women by the wells (lines 6-7), and pregnant women about to deliver in the hospital. The alliteration of shvartse ("black") and shvangere ("pregnant") devel- ops the idea of childbirth as healing. The symptoms-those black faces of women sick with childlessness-are transformed alliteratively into the cure itself, from shvartse to shvangere, from illness to pregnancy. Moving from the first to the second half of the poem, across the refrain that recurs in lines 1, 10, 17, the patterns of language convey us from a pastoral, biblical world, variants of maeyon are used, eyn ha-mayim and ha-ayenah (Genesis 24:13, 16). These words stand out from the more frequent use of be-ar in the passage, for the first appears at the moment that Eliezer prays that God will send the appointed woman, and the second at the moment he recognizes her. The Tse'ena Ure'ena acknowledges only the second instance by translating ha-ayenah as kval brunen. Yanov, Tse'ena Ure'ena, pp. 101-2. In his modern Yiddish translation, Yehoash renders the two words as kval vaser and kval. Yehoash, Torah neviim uksuvim, 2d ed. (New York: Morgen Zshurnal Oysgabe, 1942), 1:35. Molodowsky's use of krenitse alludes to these moments in the biblical text and economizes on the compound words of both the traditional and the modern Yiddish translations with (what I believe is) a slavicism. Whether and when the word krenitse enters any editions of Taytsh-khumash that Molodowsky may have known could further illuminate her usage in this poem.</page><page sequence="26">72 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN where women are like animals for the slaughter and wells provide cures, to a modern, urban world, where women give birth in hospitals. If we read the poem as a linear narrative, then the childless women of the first half have become pregnant in the second half of the poem; the women of antiquity have become women of modernity. What is strange about this transition is that the poem provides no men to impregnate the women. The only allusion to sexual union is implied in the lightning/khalofim metaphor, in which sex is relegated to an action of nature beyond human desire or will. The implicit violence in this imagery is ritualized in the Hebrew word khalofim, which, like the Hebraic words in "Froyen-lider I," connotes obedience to Jewish law. In the seventh poem, obedience is explicitly the kosher slaughtering of animals. The act of koshering makes the flesh of the sheep as "pure" or proper as the winelike blood of the old mothers in the first poem. Although it results in pregnancies that connect women with human mortality, that is, with the yet-to-be-born and the dead, such purification has only to do with forces of nature and divinity. It has nothing to do with intimate contact between woman and man, with which the central poems (II-V) of "Froyen- lider" dealt. Why is there no male presence in this poem? In Molodowsky's scheme, creativity is woman's work, which connects her with the decreed rituals of slaughter, sacrifice, and procreation. The end of the sixth poem-the fecund matriarch's gesture toward isolated, childless women-prepares for the insistence in the seventh poem on the necessity of pregnancy. Together, the poems exclude the dramatic speaker of "Froyen-lider" for whom conven- tional female fertility seems impossible. Yet the speaker is engaged in a creative act that requires no man, observing and recording the fertility of other women. She acts in words, which are themselves the very form of life, wittily encoded in the poetic form. By placing the eighteen lines of the poem on page 18 of Kheshvandike nekht, Molodowsky makes a numerical pun on the gimatria of khay (hai), the Hebrew word for "life." The struggle between the inevitable urge to create and the forces against which creativity inevita- bly must struggle-the stone, the skull-takes place within Molodowsky's poem. The poem itself becomes a metaphor for childbearing, and that child- bearing a metaphor for creating in general. This exchange between the labor of womanhood, as decreed by nature and culture, and the labor of composi- tion makes the very writing of "Froyen-lider" a revision of woman's work. In Part VII, where the dramatic "I" is subsumed by a narrative voice dis- tanced from the fertility it reports, the poet is at work, making metaphors, finding "a word for my blood."</page><page sequence="27">KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" 73 The final poem, "Froyen-lider VIII," returns to the speaker of the first five poems.32 This speaker experiences insomnia when she regards the past-her own days and the sum total of her mother's life.

The allusions of one sequence to another in Kheshvandike nekht reveal how carefully Molodowsky selected the poems and structured the book. Compare, for example, the begin- ning of "Froyen-lider VIII" with the insomnia of "a woman" in the title poem, "Kheshvandike nekht III," who cannot fall asleep without a child to hold, although she is not a mother.</page><page sequence="28">74 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN Wrapped in virtuous nightgown sleeves Are like a God's fearsome script on white parchment[.] And the words of Hamapil are themselves angry Like fiery coals extinguished by her quiet plea And they shrivel her mouth Like a withered plum.33 And her tears come drop by drop like a meager drizzle, And now that I am a woman, And walk clad in brown silk With my head bare, With naked throat; And [now that] my own life's misfortune has hunted me down, And like a crow Falling upon a chick; Often my room is lit up all night, And I throw my hands to my head And my lips recite a quiet, simple Plea to God. And tears come drop by drop like a meager drizzle. As her vision begins (lines 1-4), the speaker confronts her own past, day by day (the phrasing teg maynefargangene draws out the process of confronta- tion), in opposition to her mother's previous life as a whole. From the pre- vious poems in the sequence, we know that the speaker has chosen to act against the ancient precepts of sexual virtue and piety obeyed by the genera- tions of women in her family. In the eighth poem, the speaker stays awake to encounter the vision of her deceased mother, while earlier, the dreams of the ancestresses had haunted her sleep. In the first poem, the repetition of the word zogn, "to say" (in lines 1, 5, and 9) signaled a dialogue between the dead women and the speaker. There is no dialogue in the last poem between mother and daughter. Like the matriarch Leah in the sixth poem, the mother is a mute presence. The mother's silence, though, speaks. Whereas, Molodowsky rewrote a tkhine of the matriarchs in the sixth 33. The Yiddish lines are grammatically ambiguous-it is unclear whether the words shrivel her mouth (there would be an implied auxiliary verb hobn to complete the past tense of oysgetriknt) or whether her mouth shrivels, intransitively (un dos moyl hot ir oysgetriknt). The first case would be more interesting, for the words would have a direct, clear effect on the flesh that utters them. In either case, though, it seems fair to read the drama as follows in the text.</page><page sequence="29">KADYA MOLODOWSKY'S "FROYEN-LIDER" 75 poem, in "Froyen-lider VIII" she glosses the Shema. The image of the mother's withered hands wrapped in the tsniesdike (or "virtuous") sleeves of a nightgown (lines 5-6) recalls the generations of women who in the first poem brought their blood in tsnies to the speaker. Unlike the previous usage, tsnies is not simply the abstract quality of sexual modesty or restraint, but a tangible property of the sleeves of a nightgown worn by the mother. By locating virtue in the very garment in which a woman sleeps and (presuma- bly) has sex, Molodowsky makes more vivid and terrible the transgression by the speaker in her own sleepless night. The contrast between mother and daughter grows even stronger in the figure of holy script (line 7), which likens the image of the mother's withered hands in the nightgown sleeves to the letters ofa gotsforkhtike shrift in vayse gvilim. In this simile, the mother's hands correspond to the inscribed letters and the modest nightgown sleeves to the parchment of a holy scroll. Given the dramatic setting of the sleepless daughter's apparition of her deceased mother, these must be the words of the Shema, recited before sleeping, which one might envision written upon the parchment of a Sefer Torah or a mezuzah. The poet has likened the flesh and blood of the mother's hands (in Hebrew, yod), cupped darkly against her nightgown, to the actual letters, the two yuds of the God-fearing abbreviation of the Ineffable Name, that appear twice in the most memorable lines of the Shema. The embodiment of the word of God in the mother's flesh aggrandizes the mother's virtue and makes more anguished the strong voice of the daughter. The tension between the God's awesome Hebrew script and the secular Yiddish poem is brought forth in lines 8-12. Hamapil (Hamapl in Yiddish) is the benediction "who maketh bands of sleep to fall"34 in Kri'at shema 'al hamittah (Krishme, in Yiddish), and is recited before the Shema upon going to bed. In Molodowsky's figure, these words grow angry as they emerge from the mouth of the mother.35 Since the text of Hamapl requests a peaceful 34.

The irony forces a reevaluation of what the prayer asks, for God's answer does not appear to be in keeping with the mother's piety. The irony also pivots the speaker to reconsider the effect of piety upon the mother's body. An ambivalent reciprocity ensues, as the mother's recitation of these words extinguishes them like coals, at the same time as it empowers them to grow angry. Line 8 is very odd in Yiddish, for it animates the words of Hamapl with the reflexive, intransitive verb beyzern zikh. From this anima- tion comes a twofold movement, in which the words counteract the way they are uttered, that enacts the speaker's ambivalence toward the mother, toward prayer, and toward obedience. In the paradoxical metaphor and simile of lines 8-9 the act, the manner, the words, and the spirit of praying contradict one another. The speaker concludes from the resulting tension that devotional words shrivel the flesh of the mouth that utters them. The double force of these words-their inherent anger and destructive recitation--exacts from the mother her youth, like the autumn season that withers the plum (line 11). The autumnal allusion is borne out by the simile likening tears to a meager drizzle (line 12). This figure recalls the rains of the month of Kheshvan, which, in the title sequence, "Kheshvandike nekht," make a woman long for a fertility to correspond to the rainy season, ritualized in the Hebrew calendar. Suggesting both the sorrow in tears and the promise in rain, this simile alludes to the second paragraph of the Shema recited in the morning (and the evening), "vehaya im shamoe." This allusion to the part of the Shema not usually included in the nighttime Krishme hints that morning will follow this night. In these lines, God threatens to withhold the rains. tin mayne oygn nit eyn shlof fun toyt. (Borukh) gelibt bistu got der vos makht laykhtin tsu gor der velt mit zayn sheynhayt."

Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside and serve other gods, and wor- ship them; and the anger of the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heavens that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit.36 While morning will come for the speaker, there is no hope for her mother. These fearsome words of God have been applied literally to the mother's life. Despite her piety and chastity, her obedience and virtue, even torrential tears have been withheld from her; her life yielded only the withered self. The image of the "lips" of women has recurred significantly throughout the sequence, in relation to the metaphor of words and blood. In all the poems, parts of the female body appear detached from the whole. Here is a list of how these parts are characterized: pure blood, kosher or bee-stung heart, reddish cheeks, white teeth, bound brain, heavy head, knees which drop to the stone doorstep, pale or emaciated hands, standing fingers, thin and dry or prim or parched lips, reflected face, heavy brows, gravitating or aching limbs, closed or tired or weeping eyes, sealed womb, shriveled mouth, naked neck, bare head. This fragmentation of the female body is symbolic of the speaker's own conflict with the biological definition of women's lives. Yet the image of "lips" in particular completes Molo- dowsky's operating metaphor for poetry of words and blood. In poem III, the fainting speaker has "thin, dry lips." In poem IV, she turns away from her reflection with its "prim lips." In poem VI, solitary women "talk to themselves with parched lips." And in poem VIII, the mother's mouth is shrivelled "like a withered plum." The lips of women in "Froyen-lider" are bloodless and, it would seem, utter unembodied words. Yet these closed, drained lips recall their opposites: lips that kiss and suck, admitting love and nourishment; lips of the mouth that energetically emit words; lips of the vagina that issue forth a baby. This brings us back to the figure in Genesis of the earth's mouth through which the blood of Abel cries out to God, revers- ing birth. As the mother's constricted prayer withers her lips in "Froyen- lider VIII," it echoes the double movement of language in the Genesis pas- sage where the blood fell on the earth, endowing the earth with a mouth, and blood with a voice calling for justice. Molodowsky reverses this image with 36. Siddur safat emet, p. 44.</page><page sequence="32">78 KATHRYN HELLERSTEIN bitter irony. In the imagery of the Shema, the pious mother of the poet is figured as the arid earth from which rain has been unjustly withheld. In this figure of the earth, the mother's mouth is bloodless from the words of God's commandments and cannot emit her own voice. In the second half of the poem (lines 13-24), the daughter finds herself unable to fall asleep, although her mother has recited Hamapl. According to the traditional guidelines in the Kitzur Shulhan Arukh, which instruct one not to eat, drink, or speak after saying the benediction Hamapl until falling asleep, the cure for insomnia is to reread "the Shema, the Psalms, and the verses referring to God's mercy, and if necessary read it over and over until one falls asleep."37 The sleepless daughter does not take this advice, but rehearses the differences between herself and her mother. In contrast to her mother's modest and "virtuous nightgown sleeves," the daughter dresses immodestly in brown silk, with her head uncovered and her throat revealed. Instead of reciting the prayers for sleeping, as did her mother, the speaker stays up all night in her lighted room. Although the syntax of lines 18-19 is ambiguous, the simile of the crow falling upon a chick appears to modify line 17, with an extra un ("and") added for emphasis, and characterizes the misfortunes that have hunted down the speaker, now that she is a woman. Despite this ambiguity, the simile emphasizes the predatory force of nature in the daughter's life, which contrasts to the order that the culture of obedience imposed on the mother's life. The passive imagery of the mother's life-in-nature-the withered plum of her lips-contrasts violent but dyna- mic imagery of the daughter's life. The violence of this figure recalls the earlier figure of lightning as ritual slaughtering knives. That metaphor balanced the forces of nature and ritual in the lives of fecund women, and excluded the protagonist of the sequence. In the animal imagery of the eighth poem, the speaker seems to find an uneasy entrance to the natural order. The daughter is unable to follow up the mother's recitation of Hamapl with the decreed act of sleep, just as, in earlier poems, she could not follow the precepts of the ancestresses to be chaste and patient. Rather than repeat- ing the Shema and reciting psalms "over and over until one falls asleep," in the customary way, the insomniac daughter composes her own words. Yet these words turn the poem back on itself and convey the profoundly un- 37.

This negation culminates in the image of hands thrown to the head (lines 21-24), which repeats the gesture at the close of "Froyen-lider II" that com- pared the daughter's rigid fingers on her face to the mother's hands blessing the Sabbath candles. This image further echoes the gesture of Mother Leah, who hid her eyes in her hands at the end of "Froyen-lider VI" (lines 34-35). In "Froyen-lider II," the daughter's "ten numbered sins" were ironically juxtaposed with the mother's piety. Mother Leah's gesture in "Froyen-lider VI" both acknowledged and denied the sorrow of a woman alone. With this gesture, Molodowsky has established a correspondence between the endings of these three poems. In the closing lines of the sequence, this gesture recon- ciles the speaker's conflicts through a further correspondence. She prays. With the repetition of the word gebet (lines 9, 23) the poet likens the daughter's plea to the mother's, but only to contrast them further. The mother's prayer was angry; the daughter's words neither grow angry nor destroy the fruit of her body. Rather, the daughter's prayer is a quiet, simple prayer, an articulation of the tears that follow, in line 24. Described in the same words as the mother's, the tears of the daughter are generalized and not possessed by the pronouns mayne or ire. Like the mother's tears, they meagerly nurture and console. Although by praying, the speaker submits to God, she does not re- nounce her chosen disobedience to the ways of her mother and her grand- mothers. The first half of Part VIII has shown that there is as meager a comfort from God for the woman who follows the laws of virtue and fears the words of God as there is for the woman who shakes herself free of them. The mother bore the speaker, the speaker "bears" the poems. In these poems, Molodowsky has found "a word for my blood," to fashion a new kind of prayer, a tentative revision of women and poems.
