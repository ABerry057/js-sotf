<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shalom Goldman. The Wiles of Women/The Wiles of Men: Joseph and Potiphar' Wife in Ancient Near Eastern, Jewish, and Islamic Folklore. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. xxxiii, 189 pp. As confidence in our ability to reconstruct the history of ancient Israel has waned over the last several decades, scholarly attention has turned to other facets of biblical studies. One beneficiary of this frustration has been the growing research into previously neglected areas, such as the literary dimensions of the Bible, the history of biblical interpretation, and the Bible's role in interreligious relations, the latter reinforced by the increasingly pluralistic environment in which contemporary scholarship takes place. This book reflects the last two of these interests, applying them to the Joseph cycle, with consequences that also enrich our appreciation of its literary value. Few biblical stories are as amenable to this kind of discussion as that of Joseph, which is widely recognized for its literary merit as well as its links to earlier traditions. Shalom Goldman's attention extends beyond the story of Potiphar's wife mentioned in the title to include virtually the entire Joseph saga. Moreover, his search goes well beyond the usual comparisons with</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 125 Egyptian lore, such as the Tale of Two Brothers, reaching as far as Homer's account of Bellerophon in order to assess the biblical account's connections, both genetic and thematic, with other literature, as well as the ways in which it has been interpreted in the Jewish and Muslim traditions. In order to accomplish this, he has amassed a wealth of material, arranged here according to the biblical theme to which it relates. Among these are the portrayal of Joseph, including his magical ability and his sexuality (as well as that of Potiphar's wife), references to Egyptian culture, the role of women, and the disposition of his bones. Along the way, Goldman offers several of his own observations. Some of these, such as his suggestion that the similarity between the Bible's descriptions of Joseph and of his mother, Rachel, imputes an androgynous element to the former's appearance, are quite insightful; others, such as his claim that long hair was an Israelite ideal, seem less well grounded. At the same time, many issues are left unaddressed. For example, both the book's title and its structure would lead one to expect some sustained analysis of the way gender is treated in these narratives: Are either men or women portrayed as wily? What role does gender play in the interpretive traditions which build on this biblical account, and does it vary from one community to another? However, these questions are barely even asked. Nor are the relationships among the various cultures which produced these traditions explored. To be sure, the possibility of interaction is noted. Thus the introduction is subtitled "Joseph, Comparative Folklore, and Questions of 'Influence.' " Goldman also suggests that the treatment of individual biblical themes may be rooted in the background and values of the tradition in which these interpretations are found, such as the Qur'an's tendency to focus on holiness where the Bible was concerned with heroism, and elsewhere proposes that some Muslim traditions may have been derived from Jewish lore. However, these points are more often asserted than proven. Particularly conspicuous is the absence of Christianity, which is also, after all, a biblically rooted tradition that elaborated on these tales. However, we never even learn whether the Church Fathers were familiar with these traditions, and if not, why not. For the most part, then, this book is expositive, setting out many interpretations, sometimes cited only from secondary sources, with occasional comparisons but no larger analysis. On a more prosaic level, the author has been ill-served by his publisher, who failed to correct obvious errors or to ensure uniformity of style. Some words are even spelled differently within just a few pages of each other (e.g.,</page><page sequence="3">126 BOOK REVIEWS Reuven Firestone on pp. xv and xxii; Baidawi and al-Baydawi on pp. 16, 17, 104, 105, 134, and 136, cf. pp. 47 and 96; and Sura twice on p. 18). Despite these reservations, this book presents a wide array of legends and interpretations, offering those interested in the roots and developments of a biblical tradition the ingredients for a rich feast. The author is often perceptive, insightful, and interesting, even if his claim that he is studying "the relationship between variants on the Potiphar's wife motif in the Near Eastern cultural sphere" (p. xii, emphasis added) remains largely a promise to be explored by readers and future researchers. In that endeavor, the impressive collection of material gathered here will provide an invaluable resource. Frederick E. Greenspahn University of Denver Denver, Colo.</page></plain_text>
