Jerusalem: Ben Zvi Institute, 1996. vi, 273 pp (Hebrew). This volume is a solid treatment of Rabbi Aharon Garish's Mesah 'Aharon commentary on the Torah. The commentary was probably written in Aleppo, northern Syria, at the beginning of the sixteenth century. It was probably one of the last works composed in the Musta'rabi community (Judeo-Arabic-speaking Jews native to Arab lands) in Aleppo, for this was the era when Sephardi deportees from Iberia were taking over the Jewish communities in Aleppo and many other places in the Middle East both economically and spiritually/religiously.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 121 Rabbi Aharon Garish wrote his volume in Judeo-Arabic, a multiglossic ethnolect that has been spoken and written in various forms by Jews throughout the Arabic-speaking world. In its written form, its literature is concerned for the most part with Jewish topics and is written by Jewish authors for Jewish readers. There are several important features characteristic to Literary Judeo-Arabic: elements of Classical Arabic, dialectal components, pseudo-corrections, and standardization of such features. Moreover, several additional features peculiar to Literary Judeo- Arabic further complicate the sociolinguistic and cultural picture: the use of Hebrew rather than Arabic characters, different traditions of Judeo-Arabic orthography, elements of Hebrew and Aramaic vocabulary and grammar, and interference from Hebrew and Aramaic in Judeo-Arabic texts. Judeo-Arabic underwent a dramatic change around the fifteenth century, when the Jewish world severed its contact with the Muslim world and its Arabic language and culture. The change that marked the end of Medieval Judeo-Arabic and the start of Late Judeo-Arabic was especially marked in North Africa, but less so in Yemen, where strong contact persisted for some time afterward. In order to refine and more accurately describe the history of Judeo-Arabic, I propose to divide its history into five periods: Pre-Islamic Judeo-Arabic, Early Judeo-Arabic (8 "/9th to 10' cent.), Classical Judeo-Arabic (10h to 15' cent.), Later Judeo-Arabic (15" to 19th cent.), and Modern Judeo-Arabic (20t cent.). Thus a major change occurred in the fifteenth century between Medieval and Late Judeo-Arabic. Against this background, Metzah 'Aharon was composed during the beginning period of Later Judeo-Arabic. The volume under review is a reworking of Ilan's master's thesis submitted to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1987. Ilan states at the outset that he intends to determine the time and place of the commentary, identify its aims and the nature of its readership, expose the sources upon which it is based, describe Rabbi Garish's uses of sources, examine the literary structure of the commentary, and finally, examine its cultural importance (p.9). Ilan has achieved all of these goals. First, he briefly describes the history of Aleppo and Aleppo Jewry at the end of the Mamluk period and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire. Second, he identifies and analyzes the ten manuscripts he is using in a concise philological manner. Third, he describes Rabbi Garish's life and activities, sets the commentary's place of composition in Aleppo, and dates it before 1527. Fourth, he shows that the aims of the commentary are educational/pedagogical, demonstrating that Rabbi Garish was not writing for the elite,</page><page sequence="3">122 BOOK REVIEWS but rather for the unscholarly public that was constantly exposed to external influences. For this reason, Rabbi Garish presents arguments against the Karaites and the Samaritans that emphasize the importance of Jewish oral tradition and its necessary connection to the written Torah. Fifth, Ilan demonstrates that Rabbi Garish based his commentary on various biblical commentaries, Talmud commentaries, midrashic/aggadic collections, and Maimonides' writings. An important summary on page 146 lists Rabbi Garish's sources in a clear, concise way. Sixth, Ilan describes the literary structure of Rabbi Garish's work. It is arranged according to the Torah portions. The commentary on each portion starts with an introductory poem followed by thepetihta--an interpretive part. Only then does the body of the commentary come, followed by an ending poem that usually expresses yearning for Israel's speedy redemption. According to Ilan, the commentary is clearly based on sermons, a phenomenon known from that period. And finally, Ilan eloquently sketches Rabbi Garish's beliefs. He shows how the rabbi was actually "one of the people" in his beliefs, whether about miracles, the treatment of Christians, the pursuit of redemption, or the attitude toward the Kabbalah. Ilan analyzes Rabbi Garish's work meticulously and in great detail. Because his discussions are so detailed, it would have been useful for him to provide a summary of each chapter of the book, as he did for chapter 4. I agree with his view that more work needs to be done (chap. 7), especially linguistically. Ilan makes some references to Rabbi Garish's language (e.g., pp. 72, 87-8), but much more is needed. In fact, a linguistic analysis of the commentary would be a valuable addition to the growing number of linguistic studies in Judeo-Arabic.
