<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael L. Satlow. Tasting the Dish: Rabbinic Rhetorics of Sexuality. Brown Judaic Studies 303. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. xix, 370 pp. Tasting the Dish is intended as a preliminary step toward a rabbinic history of sexuality (p. 315). Focusing on the arguments ("rhetorics")' by which the rabbis bolster their rulings and opinions on sexuality, Michael Satlow analyzes rabbinic texts concerning incest, sex between Gentiles and Jews, nonmarital sex, homoeroticism, and nonprocreative and marital sexual behaviors. Four threads are followed throughout. Primary attention is given to discussion of individual passages and the rhetorical arguments employed or reflected therein. In doing so, Satlow also addresses in detail the similarities and differences between the Palestinian and Babylonian texts and traditions. Brief consideration is given to nonrabbinic parallels which sketch out a cultural context for the range of rhetorical arguments. Finally, the problematic relationship between rabbinic rhetoric and social reality is addressed. Satlow's study weaves the first two threads into a garment rich with detail and nuance. From his examination of rabbinic texts, Satlow discerns two general types of rhetorics: legal rhetorics, which define and categorize sexual transgressions and establish issues of liability, and nonlegal, or persuasive, rhetorics, which discuss the progeny of sexual intercourse, the association of sexual transgressions with other forbidden activities, such as idolatry and murder, the identification of forbidden activities with sectarians or non-Jews, divine retribution, the defilement conferred by sexual relations under particular circumstances, apologetics for or exculpation of biblical characters who appear to have violated rabbinic sexual restrictions, and concrete retribution, such as economic penalties (pp. 320-327). Throughout, Satlow is careful not to harmonize the various texts into a single "rabbinic tradition" but rather differentiates among the various layers 1. Satlow uses the term "rhetoric(s)" not as a technical reference to the classical Greek and Roman discipline of that name, but in the broader sense of "persuasive argument."</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 117 of Palestinian and Babylonian texts and traditions. Three general differences emerge. First, Palestinian sages, as represented in Palestinian texts and/or cited in the Babylonian Talmud, develop arguments based on Scripture, whereas Babylonian sages proffer logical argumentation and draw on sociological factors as well as actual, observed behaviors. Second, Palestinian sages gen- erally frame their discussions of sexuality around marriage and procreation, while the Babylonian sources are more sensitive and accepting of nonmarital and nonprocreative expressions of sexuality. Third, and most significant, the Palestinian sources identify masculinity with activity, penetration, and power, and associate femininity with passivity, being penetrated, and weakness. Satlow notes that modem arguments regarding the positive view of human sexuality in rabbinic sources draw almost exclusively from Babylonian texts, which "reflect a much more complex, and conflicted, set of sexual assumptions than do Palestinian sources" (p. 319). While such differences are clearly explained, the historical and/or cul- tural factors which underlie them remain murky. Satlow's brief discussions of nonrabbinic texts do reveal some parallels to rabbinic perspectives on sexuality. The rhetoric of categorization, for example, is evident in Greek and Roman discussions of citizenship, which was granted only to those who had two citizen parents (p. 95); the rhetoric of defilement is used in Jubilees (Jub 30: 10-11) and Philo's treatise on Moses (Mos 1.285-304) in disapprobation of intercourse with Gentiles. While these parallels are intriguing, they frequently are too briefly developed to do more than underscore the value of such comparative study. Similarly suggestive but sketchy are Satlow's attempts to move from rhetoric to reality. In some instances, he provides cogent, if necessarily speculative, reasons for a particular rabbinic viewpoint. The likelihood, for example, that the child of a Gentile man and a Jewish woman would remain with her/his Jewish mother may have lent an urgency to the rabbinic efforts to determine the child's precise status-is he/she a mamzer/et, hence an ineligible marriage partner, or a Jew?2 Conversely, the definition of the child of a non-Jewish mother as a Gentile was a matter of easy agreement, since in any case he or she was unlikely to reside within the Jewish community (p. 95). 2. The position that the child of such a liaison is a mamzer/et is consistently attributed to Palestinian rabbis by the Babylonian Talmud. Babylonian sages, and the redactor of the Babylonian Talmud, however, most often find the child "fit," i.e., Jewish (p. 88).</page><page sequence="3">118 BOOK REVIEWS About many other issues, however, Satlow remains silent. What are the assumptions, and the social realities, for example, which underlie the rabbinic consensus that a girl between eleven years and one day old and twelve years and one day old is permitted to use (or accustomed to using) a mok, a contraceptive sponge, "lest she conceive and perhaps she will die"?3 Satlow argues that while this formulation ostensibly expresses concern for the girl, its specific purpose is not to protect her life or health but her procreative potential (p. 233). This would seem a somewhat ungenerous interpretation were it not for the rabbinic sequel: "Less than that and more than that he has intercourse in his regular way and does not fear."4 This passage assumes the normalcy of sexual relations with a minor, perhaps in the context of marriage, yet Satlow does not address the question of whether or not such intercourse was acceptable to the rabbis and/or practiced in their various milieus.5 Greater exploration of the connections between rabbinic rhetoric and social reality, speculative as it must be, would have added to the value and interest of this study for those who are not specialists in rabbinics. Further, a topical index as well as an index to textual citations would have been very welcome. Nevertheless, the book succeeds in its primary goal, providing a detailed analysis and cogent categorization of rabbinic rhetorics of sexuality, and a sturdy foundation for exploring related issues. The most enduring impression, however, may well be the androcentrism of the rabbinic material, and its relentless sexual objectification of girls and women. Satlow's close attention to the different voices of the rabbinic texts cannot overcome the most profound silence of all, that of the women whose most intimate acts are enscribed in these texts but whose voices are rarely heard. Adele Reinhartz McMaster University Hamilton, Ont. 3. The other classes permitted to use or accustomed to using a contraceptive sponge are pregnant and nursing women (Tosefta Niddah 2:6). 4. This is the reading in Tosefta Niddah 2:6. Parallels in the Babylonian Talmud (e.g., Yebamot 12b, 100b, and others) use feminine pronouns rather than masculine ones: "less than this or more than this she has intercourse as she usually does" (p. 233). 5. Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 13a-b considers "those who marry young girls not of childbearing age" to be among those who delay the Messiah (p. 249; cf. p. 258). Satlow does not address this issue in any detail, however.</page></plain_text>
