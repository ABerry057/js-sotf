New York: New York Univer sity Press, 2007. viii, 328 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001451 The Shtetl: New Evaluations is the first volume of a new series published by the Ehe Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies. It is significant that the first volume of this new series is dealing with, even on preliminary glance, such a complex and rich subject. To this day, the shtetl is one of the?perhaps even the?Jewish place in collective memory. In fact, the shtetl was the only place in the Diaspora where the Jewish population was not outnumbered: Jews generally constituted 80 percent or more of shtetl populations. But dates and facts seem to be irrelevant in discourses surrounding the shtetl. Instead, they have become complex mixtures of oral histories and fictional literature that have conserved a microcosmic narra tive of the shtetl for more than a hundred years. The shtetl can barely be found on maps, and hardly anyone can provide information on the present-day existence of the regions where they existed. One might say that the shtetl has endured through the writings of various authors who, to this day, are the ones who have bestowed meaning onto what they are and were. The image of a "lost world," a place where "people and books lived" (Paul Celan), dominates shtetl discussions and seems to make a more objective and academic discussion nearly impossible. Fortunately, this is where this first volume starts. From the first article, Gershon David Hun derte well-founded but regrettably short demographic study presents an objective and "anti-mythical" keynote, setting the tone for the whole volume. The book is organized into fourteen interdisciplinary contributions. One small criticism is perhaps that the book lacks classifications of different thematic sections. An arrangement of this sort might have simplified the process of reading through the book and thus served as a helpful guide for research. Samuel Kassow's introduction deserves particular mention. He provides a solid review of the current status of research and the contributions of the volume. In the second essay, Imma nuel Etkes examines the relation between the yeshiva and the local community of the Lithuanian town Volozhin. The dependency of the townspeople on the yeshiva is an interesting example of the shtetl as an economic force. The third contribution focuses on "Rebbetzins and Wonder-Children" and Hasidism. The hasidic move ment is certainly a matter of particular interest in this context, and the question of its dynastic principle, which is discussed here, has attracted comparatively little 460</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews attention in the field of shtetl research. Next, Henry Abramson examines politics in the shtetl at the turn of the twentieth century. This impressive essay explicates the shtetl in the context of different political currents?particularly with regard to Zionism, socialism, and renewed traditionalism. Both articles which follow deal with the shtetl in Poland during the time of World War I and the interwar period. This time is explained as a moment of uncertainty and change. The plunder of Jewish property during the war involved adversity and pauperization; the consequence was an increased migration to urban centers. But the shtetl lived on?affected by the fight against poverty and economic antisemitism, as well as by the growing contrasts between modernity and tradition. Whereas these essays focus on the historic shtetl, other contributions approach the shtetl in a context of fiction and reality. In these essays, the "shtetl myth" is dis cussed through various perspectives. The shtetl has attracted scholarly attention during the last few decades, and since the events of 1989-90, new opportunities for traveling and research have become possible. But has the opening of the Eastern European borders changed the shtetl reception? Did the shtetl develop from a literary topos to a real makoml The answer is a clearly no! Even the reverse is true?the shtetl became the "virtual Disneyland" of Eastern Europe. Myths have arisen, especially out of a recent phenomenon: a nostalgia- and memory-laden tourism. Katarzyna Wi?clawska stresses in her fascinating essay, "The Image of the Shtetl in contemporary Polish Fiction," that "the East-European little town has always been a myth in Jewish-American literature" (251)?which has included a colorful mix of travel reports, newspaper reports, and childhood recollections, readily available to anyone interested in shtetl culture. Woven into this myth-making process are writings of different authors, gen erally from Galicia and the Bukovina. In this context Elie Wiesel's reflections on "The World of the Shtetl" are very enriching. His essay contains both nostalgic personal memories and historic facts, but without any trivialization. Regrettably, sources such as this often inadvertently contribute to a myth of an idyllic religious and culturally vested society. To form an as objective as possible impression of the shtetl, its past, and also its present, an in-depth treatment of the "shtetl myth" is both unavoidable and imperative. The reasons for this are diverse and complex; in fact, the Holocaust destroyed all Jewish settlements in Eastern Europe and also the shtetl culture, which was pronounced in this region and unique to it. From the sixteenth century until World War II, Jews in Poland (Austria) and Russia created their own world?a promised land in the Diaspora. But the rising of "the literary geography of the Shtetl" (190), as mentioned by Israel Bartal in his contribution about "Imagined Geography: The Shtetl, Myth, and Reality," derives from a time when this world was already under threat. As Arnold J. Band expresses in his essay "Agnon's Synthetic Shtetl," the shtetl is "an imagined construct based on literary description" (234). For understanding fic tional shtetl literature, the reader should not look for the image or the myth but rather needs "sensitivity to the intertextual resonances" (241 )?this could be the key to approximate an understanding of the shtetl with all of its contrariness. The few critical remarks underline the volume's great intellectual qualities, which give rise to important questions that most assuredly deserve more attention 461</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews in European historical studies and analysis. It is for this particular reason that this interdisciplinary volume is both an instructive and successful addition to existing shtetl literature.
