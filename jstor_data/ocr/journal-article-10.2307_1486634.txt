<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jose Faur. In the Shadow of History: Jews and Conversos at the Dawn of Modernity. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992. x, 311 pp. On the back cover of Jose Faur's In the Shadow of History, there are comments about his "provocative thesis," the "'secret' history of ideas [which] developed among converso intellectuals," and his "bold speculative vision of the telos of modern Jewish and modern western thinking." There is no doubt in my mind that Faur has come forth with some highly original and provocative ideas that are to be admired. In addition, as a scholar who clearly has linguistic access to numerous sources as well as expertise in varied fields, he confronts his Jews and conversos "at the dawn of modernity" in a unique way. The strengths of the book lie in the creative way the mind of the converso and the Sephardi Jew is analyzed. Faur combines his knowledge of medieval Jewish philosophy with notions of history and political science before attempting to assess various outstanding figures and developments. At times, however, he is not entirely convincing, as, for example, regarding his list of six events leading to the destruction of the Iberian Jewish community (pp. 26-27) or his contention that Bordeaux was the site of the birth of skepticism (p. 109). The analysis of Uriel da Costa (in chap. 7) is penetrating, relying on earlier works such as that of I. S. Revah, yet examining all possibilities further. Faur is correct to delve into the Christian mind and mentality as well</page><page sequence="2">264 BOOK REVIEWS as Church theology at every opportunity. Thus his comparison of da Costa to Paul as well as to Jesus is exciting. The author debunks C. Gebhardt's ideas, but often neglects to consult works of his own contemporaries, on the whole seeming to prefer European to Israeli scholars. He frequently mentions Orobio de Castro but never cites From Christianity to Judaism: The Story of Orobio de Castro, the excellent biography by Yosef Kaplan, which is available in both Hebrew (Jerusalem, 1983) and English (Oxford, 1989). In addition, Kaplan has numerous insightful works that examine, among other things, the mindset of the Portuguese and Spanish conversos and Jews, the community in Amsterdam, etc.; all are obvious by their absence in the voluminous list of notes. Likewise in his analysis of Crescas (p. 177), Faur cites H. Wolfson and ignores younger scholars such as Ze'ev Harvey and Avi Ravitsky. In the course of the book, Faur is constantly leaping from medieval to modem sources and back again, from Augustine to Newton to Nietzsche to Maimonides to Am6rico Castro, a phenomenon that at times creates a sense of anachronism and disjointedness. At the same time, he often alludes to the inquisition in Iberia, but his sources are rather outdated, as he relies on C. Roth and F. Mocatta without including H. Beinart, E. Peters, and others. The author twice refers to the role of women in Jewish (pp. 26-27) and converso life (p. 122), the latter an idea first expounded upon by Revah; yet one wonders about odd comments such as the reference to a character in La Celestina as "anticipating current feminist trends" (p. 73). The discussion of Spinoza (chaps. 8 and 9) is interesting; the plausible contention is made that support of the Christian public would not have come forth without the expression of hostility to Jews and Judaism on his part. However, the return to Spinoza in the final chapter, entitled "Postmodern Interpretation," takes the reader by surprise. These closing remarks are based on the contention that because Spinoza tried to distort history in order "to deny the Jews the status of persecuted," his ideology was espoused by petty bureaucrats in totalitarian-type regimes; they seem oddly out of place. Having discussed major intellectual figures and works of conversos and Sephardim (which cannot all be mentioned in this short review), their contributions and innovations, why did he conclude on such an unexpected note? While showing how so many converso and Sephardi minds were essentially trailblazers in the fields of history, philosophy, and literature, why shift the emphasis?
