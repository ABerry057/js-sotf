<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Susan A. Handelman. The Slayers of Moses: The Emergence of Rabbinic Interpretation in Modern Literary Theory. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982. xxi, 267 pp. The Slayers of Moses expresses a sense that many share, with an excite- ment that many feel, of an emergence of rabbinic methods in modern liter- ary theory. From Jacques Derrida to Harold Bloom, there is an increased awareness of the metaphysical and theological assumptions which may underlie methods of interpreting texts; and new methods are coming to be defined which have, as Susan Handelman argues, a striking and significant relation to rabbinic interpretive modes. The work in recent literary theory is therefore making possible a new assessment of Judaism's place in general culture, and a new interchange between Judaic and Christian attitudes toward texts. The significance of the Judaic tradition is gaining wider recog- nition, even while its integrity and independence are affirmed. In exploring the rabbinic aspects of recent literary theory, The Slayers of Moses examines first the historical backgrounds of biblical exegesis, and then modern expressions of these backgrounds. In its first part, it discusses Greek philosophy and rhetoric as the source of patristic theology. It then traces rabbinic modes of reading Torah from talmudic debate through midrashic, Philonic, and kabbalistic commentary, attempting to formulate general principles by which Judaism approaches the biblical text. This is followed by a history of Christian exegetical methods, from Jesus and Paul through Origen, Augustine, and other church fathers. In its second part, the book examines the work of Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, and others, trying to correlate their hermeneutical methods with those examined in the book's first half. Thus, The Slayers of Moses has two centers of interest-the theological and the modern-which, however, interpenetrate. Handelman approaches Jewish and Christian religious traditions through the terms and conceptions developed in modernity. She also approaches modern literary theorists 273</page><page sequence="2">274 BOOK REVIEWS through theological and religious categories. In general, the book's efforts are directed toward defining elements in recent theory which suggest or reflect a Judaic rather than a Christian hermeneutic. It posits an open- ended, multiple, and discontinuous interpretive mode as rabbinic, in which each verse is examined in turn rather than subsumed into a unitary argu- ment and many readings can coexist with each other. This mode focuses upon concrete instances rather than abstractions, on specific textual elements and events and laws. Its exegetical method proceeds, in Handel- man's terms, by way of "metonymic" or associative reasoning which works among literal "signifiers," that is, the particular letters, words, and texts of the Bible in their literal sense. This method is likened to the open-ended, multiple, and discontinuous interpretations of modern literary theorists, who similarly, according to Handelman, focus upon the associations among literal textual elements and do not attempt to reconcile all the issues raised in the course of their discussions. In contrast, Handelman posits a Christian hermeneutic concerned with the "figurative" rather than with the "literal," with abstract concepts ("signifieds") rather than concrete textual elements ("signifiers"), and which synthesizes critical discussion into a closed, uni- tary, and hierarchical interpretation. In this mode all interpretive details are integrated and seen to refer to a single issue or final figure, such as that of Jesus as the Incarnate Word. The book therefore posits a series of dichotomies, often drawn from literary theory and then applied to theology, as a means of drawing distinc- tions between the two religious traditions. Judaic exegesis, according to Handelman, is concerned with the particular as against the general, the concrete as against the abstract, the predicate as against the subject, the signifier or concrete textual detail as against its signified concept, metonomy or associative reasoning as against metaphor or figurative reasoning, the auditory as against the visual, etc. The Christian tradition is associated with each contrary term. Handelman has therefore attempted general assessments of exceedingly complex phenomena. She succeeds in offering a wide array of source materi- als, with a substantial bibliography and a useful collection of texts and refer- ences. Each figure's thought, both ancient and modern, is summarized in turn, so that the book provides a general introduction into many of the systems of thought central to current literary discourse. And her sense of a basic distinction between a Judaic and a Christian hermeneutic is justified. Yet The Slayers of Moses is not ultimately faithful to its own premises and does not finally realize its own promise. This is partly due to the scholarly</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 275 difficulties inherent in Handelman's undertaking, which are, as she acknowledges, formidable. But it is also due in part to Handelman's own stance. For each system of thought, as it is summarized, is overschematized; and ultimately, the different discussions do not cohere. The book's dichotomies, in identifying a single opposing term with one tradition as against the other, omit forces and factors in each which are significant; and the author overlooks important aspects of their interrela- tion. Moreover, the terms shift from context to context without consistent usage, leading to a lack of integration among the book's various discussions. The different categories of each opposition are not in fact fully equivalent. There is a lack of alignment among the terms, the relations between which are never fully examined. This is not the case, as we noted, with Hebraic thought, where word and thing are intimately interconnected; the relation of word to thing is not the relation of abstract to concrete, but rather the characterization of the inner specific reality of the thing. In place of representation is grasped reality. Because there is no absolute division between word and thing, the general mode of Rabbinic thought ties the generalization to the particular or rather embeds it within the particular. Perhaps it could be said that the imagery concept is to the repre- sented category as the word is to the thing in the meaning of davar. To use the linguist Jakobson's terms, the relation is not one of substitution (metaphor) but contiguity (metonymy). (P. 62) Word here is contrasted with thing, without ever establishing thing as a physical or an ontological category. The correlation of word/thing and abstract/concrete is therefore unclear, especially when "concrete" is then defined through the ontological abstraction "inner specific reality." "Repre- sentation" is posed against "grasped reality" without confronting the episte- mological problems of such a distinction. Finally, the various terms are somehow equated in turn with "metaphor" and "metonymy," while the complex relation between these two tropes is ignored (metonymy, for example, is not merely governed by association, but also involves substitu- tion). The relation between terms seems unclear; so do the terms themselves. For example, the terms "signifier"/"signified" are used without fully defin- ing or consistently applying them. Introduced into modern theory through Ferdinand de Saussure, the term "signified" designates the "concept" or "content" of a sign, as opposed to the "signifier," its shape or "form," by which the "content" is signified. The terms are here invoked by way of</page><page sequence="4">276 BOOK REVIEWS Jacques Derrida, who has, as Handelman asserts, defined and explored their metaphysical implications. According to Derrida, the "signified" concept acts as an ontological category, not unlike a Platonic Idea. It is thus open to the post-Nietzschean critique of ontology as removed from and devaluating the sensible world of actual, concrete, literal "signifiers." Derrida posits instead a system of signification-a model for how-signs-mean-which relies not on the distinction between the "signified" concept and its signify- ing, literal sign, but rather on the interrelation among concrete details which are never displaced by some supposed concept separable from them. Meaning would thus be generated through the systematic interrelation among concrete signs, rather than by reference to some "idea" toward which the signs point and which would leave the concrete level behind. Terms drawn from modern theory, such as "signified" and "signifier," can, as Handelman asserts, elucidate the distinctions between the Judaic and Christian structures of signification. The book's own terminological confu- sion, however, obscures her effort. On the one hand, Greco-Christian philo- sophy is indicted as "a thought process that mistook signs for things" (p. 118), that is, for having failed to distinguish between them. On the other hand, the rabbinic view is praised because in it "there is no mimetic concep- tion of language, no radical separation of word and thing, signifier and signified" (p. 89). Again, sign and thing are said to be inseparable. The use of these terms thus fails to explain how a rabbinic refusal to displace the literal "signifier" for allegorized meaning-part of the rabbinic insistence on the significance of each letter-differs from the Christian subsumption of each particular signifier-whether it be image or event-into the ulti- mate signified of Jesus as logos, as occurs in the typological treatment of Old Testament characters and events as prefigurations of the New Testament. Similarly, Handelman describes the rabbinic world as "one of intertextuali- ty. Texts echo, interact and interpenetrate. In the world of the text, rigid temporal and spatial distinctions collapse" (p. 47). This description applies to Christian typology as well, and leaves unclear the distinctive elements in rabbinic practices. At the same time, Handelman claims that in the rabbinic view, the biblical text "is only superficially a description of the past" (p. 78), which seems more true (though not entirely so) of Christian exegetical assumptions than of Judaic ones, in which the historical level retains unquestioned importance. Handelman's efforts to define religious distinctions in the terms pro- vided by literary theory is therefore compromised by confusions in her use of these terms. Nor is the traditional material sufficiently controlled or well</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 277 defined to clarify the theological implications of the modern terms. As Handelman herself concedes, "One needs to approach Rabbinic thought from within, for the elaboration of abstract rules is not a process which for the Rabbis was separate from the concrete instance which gives them rise" (p. 49). But, as she also admits, she proceeds to do just this. The variety, difficulty, and methods employed in rabbinic texts resist theoretical abstrac- tion; this is a problem which every student of Judaism must confront. While it may be possible to undertake this tempting and risky venture within a carefully controlled framework, The Slayers of Moses does so on too broad a basis, and at too great a distance from the texts to do them justice. There are, therefore, lapses. Handelman tends to substitute the general principles of Rabbi Ishmael for the talmudic text. Judaic impulses are categorized in terms of the book's various dichotomies, which then, however, break down. "Literal" as opposed to "figurative" readings, for instance, are adopted as the cornerstone of Handelman's analysis of exegetical methods, and are identified with the opposition between letter and spirit in Paul. But this given of Judaic/Christian exegesis forces Handleman to frame her own argument in Pauline terms, which she then tries to resist, adding to the con- fusion. At one moment, Handelman asserts that for the rabbis "the literal is never cancelled" (p. 55), while at another she claims that "to interpret the text in a non-literal manner was an integral part of the Rabbinic tradition" (p. 96). Handelman is here, as elsewhere, raising an important issue. But in Derrida it leads to a rejection of the distinction between the literal and the figurative as inherently Pauline. Handelman tries to articulate this Derri- dean position, but does so while herself remaining caught in the distinction. This terminological inconsistency tends to trap Handelman into exces- sive claims. For example, in trying to distinguish Greek notions of necessity from Jewish attitudes, she erects a Jewish doctrine of contingency: "For if the world were created through the arbitary will of God," she writes, "then it was contingent and had no necessary existence." But the Jewish idea of God is not typically one of arbitrary willfulness. "The Biblical view," she continues, "posited an extreme negativity at the center of things" (p. 28). Negativity may be invoked in certain mystical contexts, in paradoxical refer- ence to the infinity of the Godhead. But the term cannot be introduced without such qualification. There is, indeed, a general lack of rigor in Handelman's treatment of the complex issue of the place of mysticism within Jewish tradition. Citing the belief that Moses received the oral law on Sinai along with the written Torah, Handelman passes without pause to the further notion of secret,</page><page sequence="6">278 BOOK REVIEWS hidden, mystical levels of Torah-which she, however, startlingly distin- guishes from the actual written text: "The material Torah, then, is the embodiment or enclothing of this non-material original Torah, and the parameters of the text are, to begin with, infinite" (p. 38). The description here recalls Gershom Scholem's discussions of Torah-de-'astiluth, Torah in its mystical aspects-as, for instance, in On the Kabbalah and Its Sym- bolism. But Scholem is careful to note the "ambiguous nature of this theory," and indeed, its potential for heresy-a potential realized, as he asserts, in the "antinomianism and mystical nihilism" of the Sabbatians: "The mystical content of the Torah was freed from its bond with the tradi- tional meaning of the text; it became independent, and in this new state could no longer be expressed in the symbols of traditional Jewish life." Scholem himself can hardly be said, in this regard, to present "a vision of heresy as deeply traditional" (p. 199), as Handelman claims. While Scholem examines the importance of mysticism to developing Jewish traditions, he does not simply equate the mystical with the heretical. That Handelman herself does seem to equate them, however, is consistent with her own fundamental notions of the nature of rabbinic interpretation as such. For in emphasizing the "multiplicity of interpretation and diversity of opinion in Rabbinic thought" (p. 66), she comes to overlook the structures which nevertheless define rabbinic interpretation. Writes Handelman: The boundaries between text and interpretation are fluid in a way which is difficult for us to imagine for a sacred text, but this fluidity is a central tenet of much contemporary literary theory. The elevation of later commentary to the status of earlier primary text is one of the extraordinary characteristics of Rabbinic interpretation, and involves a not so subtle power struggle. Interpre- tation as a species of will-to-power will be investigated [viz.] Harold Bloom, whose literary theory focuses on the Oedipal conflict between belated inter- preter and canonical precursor. (P. 41). The extent to which Harold Bloom endorses an unqualified will-to-power as the basis of critical interpretation is highly questionable. But to claim it for the rabbinic approach is to distort the reverence, devotion, and awe which remain the distinguishing characteristic of rabbinic attitudes toward the sacred texts. It may be that there is "no before and after in Torah," as Handelman cites; but there are differences in the authority granted to acharonim and rishonim, amora'im and tana'im, rabbinic utterances and Torah itself. Even midrashic discussions, however open they may be, are not</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 279 utterly unbounded, but take place within a shared community of religious education, practices, and belief. And Torah, as the basis of all further interpretation, retains its special and preeminent status. Nevertheless, in her discussion of Judaism, Handelman is faithfully attempting to describe in modern terms principles of Judaic textual stances with which she has a fundamental sympathy. This cannot be said of her treatment of Christianity, which is often unsympathetic, and sometimes simply incorrect. There are minor problems, such as: "Monologic reading of Scripture was the province of the Church Fathers, recently converted from monist pagan philosophy" (p. 81). But many of the philosophies from which the church fathers converted were, as in the case of Neoplatonism, not monist, but dualist. In general, there is a refusal to take into account the multiplicity of forces and movements in the first Christian centuries. Nor is Christianity's attempt to synthesize Hebraic and Hellenic elements taken into account, so that neither such differences from its Greek antecedents as did evolve nor its remaining Judaic elements are ever acknowledged. Still, these oversights remain peripheral. More central to Handelman's argument, and more troubling, is what appears to be a misunderstanding of the Incarnation. As the manifestation of the logos, the Incarnation must be the heart of any discussion of the Word in the Christian tradition. Handel- man's references to it seem distorted and polemical. In the Incarnation, we are told, "the Rabbinic word became substantialized into flesh" (p. 17). "In Christianity, ... the text was supplanted, the movement of interpretation now directed to the revelation of how all words point to and are fulfilled by the word of flesh" (p. 32). The Christian sense that the logos forms the center of all revelation and interpretation must, certainly, be distinguished from Jewish interpretive premises. In Judaism, the text is never subsumed into or displaced by revelation-as-person. Still, the suggestion that the goal of the Incarnation is to focus upon and worship not the logos but the literal flesh, rather than proposing the flesh as a miraculous (to the Christian) condescension of the logos which makes it accessible to man within history, can only be described as a profound inversion of the logos doctrine. Handel- man's further characterization of the doctrine as "pagan because it literal- izes the metaphor" (p. 29) both contradicts her earlier categorizing of the Christian impulse as figural and works against an objective comparison of Jewish/Christian conceptions. The inconsistent and unclear dichotomies characterize not only the discussion of religious issues, but also the discussion of modern literary theories. First, Jacques Lacan is said to assert in a "rabbinic" mode a</page><page sequence="8">280 BOOK REVIEWS "metonymical" interplay of signifiers which move through "continuous displacements along the chain of signification-without any recourse to a signified" (p. 156). Soon after, we are told that Jacques Derrida, also in a rabbinic mode, "would break Lacan's covenant of unity between signifier and signified, abolish any illusory point of stability, which is some present signifier [sic; signified?] underlying all others or some ideal full word" (p. 164). What had seemed a Lacanian and rabbinic distinction between a signi- fied concept and signifying concrete detail comes to be called a unity, which Derrida would break. But he is then also said to protest "the very act of differentiating between signifier and signified, and postulating their exterior- ity to one another." The position of each critic remains unclear, as do the implications of unity or separation between signified and signifier. In the end, however, the dichotomy which seems most to control The Slayers of Moses is that of Us against Them. Designations of one notion as Jewish and its contrary as Christian must be fully qualified if they are to be useful. And even the Us/Them dichotomy is not consistently applied. Freud's contribution is proposed as "an extension of the line of Jewish Rabbinic hermeneutics" and thus as differing "decisively from the German Protestant tradition that culminates in the phenomenology of Heidegger and Gadamer" (p. 130). But before Heidegger, phenomenology had been explored by Husserl; and after Heidegger, it has been developed by Emmanuel Levinas and by Derrida: all of whom are Jews. The point is not, however, to put another notch on the handle of one's religious gun. Rather, it is to recognize how complex such cross- and intra-cultural exchanges are. Too extreme a line-drawing is combined with a rather strange line-blurring. Having starkly opposed Judaic against Christian interpretation, and having introduced modern theorists as Judaic in method, The Slayers of Moses concludes by positing a "heretic hermeneutic" which, it seems, includes everyone: "We may now read Jesus, Paul, Freud, and Freud's most recent interpreters, Derrida, Lacan, and Bloom as all sharing in a particular mode of Jewish heresy: a distorted displacement, an aspect of which is the conver- sion of metonymy into metaphor, or displacement pretending to substitu- tion" (p. 137). Bloom, who is superbly aware of the distinctions between his own hermeneutical heritage and the Pauline tradition of exegesis, is some- how grouped with Paul. At this point it becomes unclear what is Jewish and what is not, what is traditional and what is not. Even the emergence of rabbinic interpretation in modern literary theory no longer seems certain, unless emergence and "distorted displacement" are accepted as synony- mous. Moses seems more slain than reborn.</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 281 The Slayers of Moses raises important questions, and contains interest- ing and suggestive material. Both its fundamental thesis of Judaism as an active force in modern literary theory and its sense of distinction between Judaic and Christian hermeneutics are promising. But a less extreme polari- zation of "sides" would have strengthened Handelman's arguments, and prevented readers' qualifications from becoming objections. A deeper exploration of the implications of the impulses characterized as Judaic or Christian would have made these categories seem less arbitrary. And a firmer control of terms both modern and traditional, with more caution in applying them, seems especially necessary in a book as encyclopedic, on a subject as intricate, as is The Slayers of Moses.
