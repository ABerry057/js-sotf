<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Alexander. Jazz Age Jews. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001. viii, 239 pp. The 1920s witnessed great changes in the American Jewish community. Jews moved out of their areas of first settlement and became increasingly assimi- lated into mainstream American life, and many became prominent figures in the world of popular music, film, the law, and organized crime. Paradoxically, as they strove to be fully integrated into American society, they also desired to maintain their separate Jewish identity. The tension this created has remained a central theme of the American Jewish experience. Michael Alexander has constructed an elegantly written and compelling interpretation of how that second generation of American Jews sought to resolve this conflict. In so doing, he offers fresh insights into the sources of American Jewish liberalism. Briefly stated, his thesis is as follows: Even as the children of Eastern Euro- pean immigrants moved up in the social and economic spheres, they identified 347</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews "down" with the outsiders, with marginalized Americans, and with less fortunate individuals and groups. Alexander argues that the experience of Eastern European Jews as members of an exiled and oppressed group made their status as outsiders a central characteristic of their Jewish identity. The religious toleration, freedom, and democracy in the United States threatened this feature of their Jewish identi- ty. In order to keep alive their self-identity, many Jews intentionally impaired their economic, political, and cultural relations with gentiles. They did so by marking themselves off from American society by imitating, defending, and even partici- pating in the group life of marginalized Americans. This activity served as a means by which second generation Jews could maintain some sense of their Jewish iden- tity in free and open America. To validate his thesis, Alexander focuses on the lives of three prominent Jew- ish personalities of that era: Arnold Rothstein, gambler and underworld kingpin; Felix Frankfurter, Harvard professor and legal scholar; and Al Jolson, the greatest entertainer of that time. All three men were born in the 1880s, grew up in Jewish ghettos, married gentile women, rose to national fame and, according to Alexan- der, became heroes to the Jewish community because of their association with cer- tain key events of that decade. To wit, Rothstein allegedly fixed the 1919 World Series; Frankfurter championed the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti; and Al Jolson regularly impersonated African Americans in blackface and appeared in the first talking film, The Jazz Singer. Alexander tells the story of these men and illustrates how other Jews perceived them and their role as outsiders and, in the process, de- fined themselves as Jews. The book is divided into three sections. The first deals with Arnold Roth- stein and explains how he achieved success in the criminal economy. The second section recounts how Frankfurter challenged the Massachusetts political and legal establishments by creating a groundswell of public opinion in support of Sacco and Vanzetti. The final section surveys Jolson's career and describes how the applica- tion of burnt cork to his face allowed him to identify with black culture. Alexan- der argues that although all three men entered mainstream America, they fostered a sense of marginality. This, in turn, gave them approval and status within the Jew- ish community. Alexander buttresses his insights and conclusions by utilizing archival sources, government publications, the Yiddish press, and relevant sec- ondary sources. Despite the author's thorough research and convincingly argued case, the book contains a few misconceptions. The gangster Legs Diamond was not Jewish; he was Irish. And despite what the American Jewish press supposed, Charlie Chap- lin was also not Jewish. I also question a number of the author's assertions. While admitting that only about nine percent of the Yiddish press readership was born in America, Alexander avers that the reaction of the second generation of American Jews "is found predominantly in Yiddish newspaper coverage of the described events" (p.185, n. 3). I find his reasoning for this unconvincing. The children of the Eastern European immigrants attended public schools, where the language of instruction was English. English became their primary language. Alexander offers no firm evidence to show that the second generation learned to read, could read, or wanted to read Yiddish. The author also declares that Arnold Rothstein "never 348</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews shied from his ethnic identity and never lost group feeling" (p. 39). But he offers no evidence to support this. To the contrary, Rothstein's "group feeling" did not prevent him from sending gangsters to beat up Jewish strikers. Rothstein's career showed that making money superseded any group or ethnic loyalty he may have had. These points nonetheless do not detract from the importance of this imagi- native and splendidly written study of American Jewry during the Jazz Age. All future studies investigating the origins of American Jewish liberalism or exploring American Jewish identity will have to take Alexander's study into account. Robert A.
