<plain_text><page sequence="1">426 BOOK REVIEWS Eric Friedland, "Were Our Mouths Filled With Song": Studies in Liberal Jewish Liturgy. Monographs of the Hebrew Union College 20. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1977. xiv, 367 pp. This body of work places Eric Friedland well within the ranks of those to whom he pays tribute as ground-breakers in the study of modem Jewish liturgy: Ismar Elbogen, Abraham Z. Idelsohn, and Jakob J. Petuchowski. His work is indispensable to all who study the field of modem non-Orthodox Jewish liturgy, of which he is now the uncontested master. A reading of the work reveals that he has not cast his net too widely in describing those who should be interested in these essays: "The complete Judaicist, the student of comparative liturgies, the theologian, the sociologist of religion, the rabbi of a congregation, the seminarian, the prayer book compiler to be .. ." (p. xi). The essays, published over decades in various journals and collections directed at specific disciplines, range over a variety of topics. Collected together in this volume to the considerable advantage of any in the broad area of modem Jewish studies, they form a remarkably consistent whole, useful for research, reference, and even courses in modem Judaism. In these respects the value of the book is enhanced by a comprehensive if not exhaustive Jewish liturgical bibliography and a thorough index of sources cited, prayers, hymns, and piyyutim. The careful footnotes, extensive when called for, are often as meaty and interesting as the well-written text itself. The essays can be grouped in the following categories: (1) extensive studies of particular foundational liturgies, such as the Olath Tamid of David Einhom (Baltimore, 1858) and the Szold/Jastrow Abodath Yisrael (Baltimore, 1864-73); (2) descriptive and critical studies of contemporary prayer books, such as Gates of Prayer (Reform, 1975), Kol Haneshamah (Reconstructionist; Wyncote, 1994), Ha-Avodah ShebaLev (Israel Progressive movement; Jerusalem, 1982); (3) specialized liturgies from North America, England, and Israel, such as those for the High Holidays, Passover, and Yizkor Memorial Services; (4) specific topics related to modem liberal liturgies, such as liturgical creativity in the Hebrew language, and mystical and Sephardic influences on liberal liturgies. Considering the range of subject matter, one should not, as the author himself notes in the preface, expect a single structural or methodological approach throughout, nor, I would add, a consistent critical stance. Sometimes, perhaps due to the auspices for which a particular essay was written, one senses that Friedland is as generous in his judgments as his consistently</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 427 high standards will allow, often putting his most critical remarks in footnotes and finding a way to excuse the scholarly gaffes or liturgical blunders of which he takes note. Nevertheless he is ever alert to faulty facts or sloppy scholarship and frank about what he clearly perceives as thoughtless or groundless liturgical efforts. On the other hand, he is vocal in his appreciation of liturgical excellence as well as religious genius emanating no matter from what stream of modem Judaism. One cannot sufficiently praise the many positive aspects of Friedland's efforts, only a few of which can be noted within the limited scope of this review. These flow from a combination of mastery of the facts in his field, his broad Judaic erudition, and his considerable interpretive and analytical powers. This is evident in the depth studies in the collection, for example, those of the Einhom (pp. 17-49) and Szold/Jastrow prayer books (pp. 55-69). His sheer mastery of fact appears again and again throughout the work. One example: He traces the trail of a particular innovational phrase, "mehayyeh ha-kol," in the Reform version of the Gevurot (which replaced, for doctrinal reasons, the reference to the resurrection of the dead) to Samuel Adler's revision in the 1864 edition of Merzbacher's Order ofPrayer for New York's Temple Emanu-El, and further to Nehemiah 9:6 (p. 246). Again, because he has traversed the entire area of non-Orthodox liturgies to our own day, he can raise numerous questions, asking why, for example, Isaac M. Wise's felicitous rendering of the Birkat Shalom does not appear in any of the services in Gates of Prayer as it does in Reconstructionist and Conservative prayer books (p. 230). More important, we are afforded a view of issues that roiled segments of modem Jewry in Europe and the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. We are given relevant biographical information about individual liturgists, their intellectual lineage and relationships to fellow reformers, particularly in regard to such issues as the role of the Hebrew language in prayer, the importance of the Stammgebete, and the like. The entire work provides many corrections to scholarly images now a part of our mental furniture. One of these is of David Einhom as the archetype of an extreme radical Reform. Einhom indeed, in opposition to Isaac Mayer Wise's aspiration for a unified American Jewry, did want a clear break with those who considered rabbinic halakhah as authoritative. On the other hand, Einhom rejected extremes of the Frankfurt Synod Reformverein (1843) as "A Confession of Unbelief." He never accepted his mentor and backer Samuel Holdheim's conception of the Sabbath as merely symbolic, nor would he permit its transfer to Sunday. Intermarriage was for him anathema, the</page><page sequence="3">428 BOOK REVIEWS revelation at Sinai real, and the Torah, the word of God. "In cases where restructuring [the worship service] served no purpose except to satisfy the taste of a given congregation [or rabbi] it was to be avoided" (p. 22). Friedland shows that while in a period when even someone like Samson Raphael Hirsch was not averse to adopting certain aspects of Protestant-style worship, Einhorn had no objection to the innovation of blessing the congregation after the sermon. But while he eliminated or transposed aspects of the prayers accompanying the blowing of the shofar and replaced the shofar-sound itself with a Trompetenklang, nevertheless instead of the halbjiidisch character of earlier Reform liturgies, Einhorn wanted a service that would be echt Jiidisch (pp. 18-24). He further retained in full the traditional scriptural readings for Yom Kippur in comparison with the amended readings in subsequent Reform worship. Friedland goes on to demonstrate how the structural strategies of the Olath Tamid remained foundational in all subsequent liturgies, though the confused efforts of later editors of Reform prayer books show that they were often unaware of the principles that underlay the model from which their work derived. Scholarship should also enlighten the present. It is a prime virtue of Friedland's liturgical analysis, in our own contemporary context of dissolving ethnic forms of American Jewish identity, that we can now appreciate in David Einhorn, however mistaken in certain respects about the American Jewish future, a man who rejected the lachrymose vision of Jewish diaspora existence and affirmed an American Jewish identity centered in God and Torah, for which the synagogue was essential. We find the same combination of detailed knowledge, broad Judaic erudition, and interpretative ability in Friedland's study of Marcus Jastrow as liturgist. He reveals in Jastrow, congregational rabbi, appreciative scholar of rabbinic Judaism, editor of the monumental Aramaic dictionary of the Targumim and Talmud, a representative of the so-called Positive-Historical School, a person who saw no contradiction between an objective detailed study of the people of Israel and a passionate commitment to Judaism. Thus, in Friedland's view, the Abodath Yisrael becomes a liturgy free from theological and aesthetic dissonance (pp. 55-60). Jastow's liturgical work becomes an example of how the better part of Jastrow's life was spent in trying to bring about a modus vivendi between the innate genius of Judaism and the just demands of Reform (p. 66). Friedland's study of the Abodath Israel recovers Jastrow as a person who represents the inner conflicts not only of many rabbis of his own time but of</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 429 ours as well. He was a rabbi who wanted very much to reconcile the spirit of Reform with the innate genius of Judaism, who believed in the mission of Israel, in ethics and morality as the core of Judaism, but was unwilling to sacrifice the authentic forms of Judaism or the wholeness of Klal Yisrael on the altar of radical Reform. In these respects a liturgy becomes a reliable key to the position or outlook of a person, a group, or a Jewish movement. While the relationship between modem Jewish liturgy and the wider cultural context is not within the purview of these essays, Friedland's studies make it possible to proceed to the next important step, the investigation of the relationship between modem liberal Judaism and what we might call the faith of modernity. For example, he shows how prayer books (in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Reform) reveal an animus against ritual. Among the non-Jewish cultural elite of the time, "ritual" and "ritualistic" were terms of opprobrium associated with primitive, backward superstition and the unconscious; with African and other native peoples; in other words, with the "other" to the civilized reason of the evolved and progressive West. And "Orientalism" and "the East" were also associated among German and Western Jewry with Ostjuden and their embarrassing eastern tradition and ritual. Ironically, this cluster of attitudes was an integral part of the ideology of Western colonialism. One is reminded of Jakob J. Petuchowski's aperCu that some Reform prayer books give the impression that their editors prepared them as if Christians were looking over their shoulders. This Reform Jewish anti-ritualism may also have represented a "buying into" the Protestant anti-Catholic apologetic against religious quackery. Along the same lines, it would be of interest to relate the emphasis on biblical morality as the true core of Judaism even in persons like Marcus Jastrow and the distancing from rabbinic observance even in the Minhag America of Isaac M. Wise to the "core and husk" ideas of the liberal Christian "Essence of Christianity" ideology. Reading the essays we find another tendency in modem liturgies that also calls for a cultural-context investigation: prayer books as literary anthologies. Anyone reading Friedland's work can detect an overall trend in modem liturgies toward the retrieval of poetic and inspirational texts deriving from sources ancient to modem. Also, arising from a surmise here and there by Friedland, we can see a need now to study liturgies in terms of the audience to which they were directed. Friedland aptly interprets affecting passages in early American Reform memorial services expressing a yearning for distant relatives and their gravesites as particularly appealing to German Jewish</page><page sequence="5">430 BOOK REVIEWS immigrants. Other questions arise: Why, for example, in modem liturgies did the Yizkor memorial services become ever more elaborate? No study of modem liturgy can cover all bases. Without considerable interviews with many individuals, it would be difficult for anyone to discover how recent prayer books, many of which are the work of committees, actually arrived at their final formulation. The inclusion of so many kinds of sources and views found in Gates of Prayer, which Friedland sees as the result of the creative work of a single editor (p. 242), may have resulted not from a studied effort at cogent synthesis but from an adding together of various texts. In this respect, entire services and subsections of services were the result of the work of various liturgists in addition to the editor, Chaim Stem. One perceives that Friedland's engagement with liturgy is derived not from the choice of a rewarding scholarly niche but out of a personal engagement from youth in the music of worship and prayer. Finally, his enthusiasm makes this scholarly collection a delight to read. Herbert Bronstein Lake Forest College Lake Forest, Ill.</page></plain_text>
