<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURAL ETHNICITY IN ISRAEL: THE CASE OF MIDDLE EASTERN JEWS' RELIGIOSITY by MOSHE SHOKEID Introduction National myths and public policies in Israel long assumed that the country's diverse Jewish immigrant groups would all eventually, and indeed within a short span of time, be absorbed and fused into a unified social, economic, political, and cultural entity, but this expectation is now giving way to widespread doubts as to its feasibility. Some of these doubts were expressed during the 1970s in a series of studies which demonstrated not only that there were still gaps between Israelis of Middle Eastern and North African extraction (often called Sephardim or Oriental Jews) and those of European extraction (Ashkenazim), as regards occupational and residential mobility, income and educational achievements, political representation, Earlier versions of this paper were prepared for the International Seminar on Judaism and Secular Society and the International Seminar on East and West in Israel, held at Bar-Ilan University in the summers of 1980 and 1982 respectively. I am grateful to Shlomo Deshen, Jacob Katz, Robert Chazan, and Menachem Friedman for their helpful comments. 247</page><page sequence="2">248 MOSHE SHOKEID and social prestige, but that the gaps were widening.' The growing disillu- sionment on the part of Middle Eastern Jews (North Africans included) was dramatically revealed in the 1981 general elections by the emergence of a new ethnic party, Tami, which seemed to have better prospects of success and survival than any previous ethnic party. Moreover, the results at the polls obtained by most of the other parties seemed to reflect an intensifying ethnic polarity.2 A growing number of sociologists have been concerned with the social, economic and political factors that have led to the emerging ethnicity in Israel, but they have usually refrained from discussing more specifically the cultural elements that characterize Israeli ethnic divisions. The sociological perspective derived from the theories of modernization of the 1950s and early 1960s, which regarded Middle Eastern Jews as representing traditional societies and cultures, and expected them inevitably to move out toward the modern axis (which was apparently represented by the veteran European and mostly secularized Israelis),3 had been seriously challenged,4 but no alternative theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of cul- tural continuity and change had been suggested. The absence of a clear treatment of these processes has possibly been influenced by the prevailing general sociological approach, which seems to perceive emergent ethnicity as an ephemeral phenomenon of little consequence. This has been inter- 1. See, for example, M. Hartman and M. Eilon, "Ethnicity and Stratification in Israel" (Hebrew), Megamot (1975): 124-129; S. Spilerman and J.

The major contest in the 1981 general elections involved the Labor party and the Likud. It has been confirmed, however, that a higher proportion of voters of European extraction voted Labor while a higher proportion of voters of Middle Eastern extraction voted Likud. See A.

Deshen, who gave more specific attention to the status of the ethnic cultures, observed during the late 1960s and early 1970s the revival of some ethnic customs and traditions among Tunisian Jews.9 He interpreted this phenomenon as indicating a process by which cultural ethnicity has been 5.

These observations and interpretations suited the euphoric, optimistic national mood following the 1967 war, which for some time camouflaged the persis- tence of social gaps. A few years later, Weingrod suggested the emergence of a working-class culture which involves Middle Eastern Jews in particular.'0 He related this culture mainly to certain typical leisure activities, such as the growing popularity of national ethnic festivals, the enthusiastic attendance at football games, the popularity of particular forms of music, etc. This observation requires, however, a closer investigation of various dimensions of behavior that may constitute a more complex definition of culture. I do not intend to propose a specific definition of culture here. There is no doubt, however, that we cannot conceive of Jewish society at any stage of its history without considering the Jewish religion as a major component of its cultural presentation. The aim of this article is to indicate some trends in the cultural processes that characterize contemporary ethnic developments in Israel, as demonstrated by the role of religion in the life of Middle Eastern Jews. The religious component of Jewish culture has become increasingly problematic and a source of acute tension in recent generations as a result of the decline of social and cultural homogeneity in Jewish society at its various centers. This trend has been noticeable in Europe since the emergence of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) in the eighteenth century." Among Middle Eastern or North African Jewry, however, the process started much later, in some places at the end of the nineteenth century, in other places not until the beginning of the twentieth century or even later.12 In Israel, the question of the role to be played by religion in the nation's life has become a major source of conflict. A large segment of the population (and particularly those associated with the socialist elite which dominated the country for many decades) sees religious orthodoxy as an archaic survival of little rele- vance. Ashkenazi orthodoxy in its various shades, however, has demon- strated extraordinary viability. Apart from the ultra-Orthodox, who are concentrated in exclusive communities (such as Jerusalem, Benei-Berak, etc.), the more moderate "neo-Orthodox" group seems to have strength- 10. A.

For the purposes of the present discussion we consider religious behavior to be an integral part of a broader cultural and social repertoire, although it is often arbitrarily separated from its more comprehensive context and ana- lyzed independently in exclusively religious terms. Just as the changing position of religion in any particular group reflects on processes mainly related to the religious domain, it reflects no less on fluctuations in the status and the existential circumstances of the people involved. Thus, for example, A. Cohen demonstrated the Islamic religious revival which supported the ethnic-economic interests of the entrepreneurial Hausa traders in Yoruba towns."5 In a study of a transplanted Atlas Mountains Jewish community, I found that the field of religious activity is a very sensitive vehicle for express- ing the changing circumstances, aspirations, and achievements of indivi- duals and groups.'6 This was demonstrated by changes in the style of worship. A different situation is described by Deshen, who revealed that the abandonment of religious symbols by Tunisian immigrants in an Israeli town was a result of their considering themselves religiously unworthy to perform the observances related to these symbols.'7 Their feeling of religious unworthiness reflected, however, a wider notion of failure and self- depreciation derived from the circumstances of their new environment. The role played by religion in expressing social developments and political con- flicts has again been recently demonstrated in various parts of the Middle East, Israel included. Thus, on the one hand, certain revivalist religious trends have been identified among young Muslims in Israeli villages and 13. S.

It is therefore interesting to find out whether and how Middle Eastern Jews express in religious terms their status in Israeli society. Hypothesis and Method The first encounter between Middle Eastern immigrants and the country's secularized dominant sector, as represented in particular by the major national bureaucracies, must have been a traumatic experience for the newcomers. Moreover, their concurrent meeting with the Ashkenazi reli- gious establishment was by no means genial. Although the latter provided them with religious services and tried to recruit their youth to its educational institutions, the contacts between the Ashkenazi religious establishment and the Middle Easterners were disappointing, often painful, and ultimately of little consequence. On the whole, Ashkenazi orthodoxy in its various shades had little regard for the standards of religiosity and the ethnic traditions of the newly arrived co-religionists who had become its clients. Therefore, it could not reinforce their traditional religious patterns and did not succeed in recruiting many of the younger immigrants. Social scientists assumed that Middle Eastern Jews would tend to assimi- late with the dominant Ashkenazi segment of Israeli society. The observa- tions providing the basis for the prediction that the Middle Eastern Jews would eventually be secularized were, however, greatly influenced by a perspective of religiosity which was anchored in the Ashkenazi tradition of orthodoxy as experienced or stereotyped by the researchers. This perspec- tive inevitably leads to the conclusion that Middle Eastern Jews will even- tually abandon their religious commitment completely, a conclusion supported by the absence of noticeable trends of religious revival and the lack of institutions of religious education among Middle Eastern Jews, in contrast to the remarkable vitality observed among the various sectors of Ashkenazi orthodoxy."9 As a result of these assumptions, the newcomers 18.

Against this evaluation of the religious situation among Middle Eastern Jews, we argue that they have nevertheless developed a strategy of cultural accommodation with the sur- rounding dominant society, a strategy also employed by Middle Eastern Jews in earlier centuries. According to our observations, this has produced a religious path which appears to be midway between Ashkenazi orthodoxy, on the one hand, and Ashkenazi secularism, on the other. The symbolic presentation of this style is distinctive and appealing to the extent that it carries the potential of influencing political life in Israel, but it is not pro- vocative and exclusivist to the extent of contradicting the national ideal of social integration. These observations, we hope, may also expand our understanding of the role and strategy of emergent ethnicity in contem- porary civilization in general. The data I draw upon are varied and it may not always satisfy a strict doctrinal approach. I report on participant observations which I carried out during the late 1960s and late 1970s in villages inhabited by Moroccan immigrants. During 1979 I carried out observations in several synagogues located in two neighborhoods of Tel-Aviv, and in 1981 I interviewed sup- porters of the new ethnic party, Tami. I also draw upon ethnographic data produced by other anthropologists, the available sociological surveys and interviews with leading Middle Eastern Jews recorded by the mass media. My discussion is supported by the reconstructions of Jewish life in the Middle East provided by historians and social scientists. Precepts versus Tradition During the 1950s Israeli sociologists, mainly involved with the then dominant theories of modernization, which often sought the variables most conducive to the accommodation of traditional societies with Western technology and culture, did not show much interest in the study of Middle Eastern Jews' religiosity. In the 1960s, however, a few sociologists began to include in their surveys questions about the religious attitudes of Middle Eastern Jews.20 Thus the data produced from a national sample of eleventh- grade school students reported by Herman show that while Middle Eastern children were less religiously inclined than their parents, the proportion of 20.

In addition, consider- ably more Middle Eastern youth defined themselves as mesoratiim (lit. "traditional")-a common term for believers who observe religious precepts selectively-44 percent verses 22 percent among Ashkenazi youth. The survey also revealed noticeable differences among the various groups of Middle Eastern Jews: Yemenite youth were highest in considering them- selves religious (63 percent),21 North African youth second on the scale (44 percent) and other Middle Eastern youth came lowest on this scale (21 percent). However, the majority of Middle Eastern youth who did not con- sider themselves religious defined themselves as mesoratiim. The expansion of anthropological research in Israel since the mid-1960s had been accompanied by an increasing interest in the religious life of Middle Eastern Jews. In a study of an immigrant town, Deshen reported on the viability of ethnic synagogues: the regular participants, however, were mainly youngsters under fifteen years of age and adults above thirty-five.22 Thus the generation of young adults was absent. Another observation, mentioned earlier, indicated that the immigrants' notion of religious depre- ciation reflected their deteriorating position in other spheres of life. We may assume that this low self-esteem also influenced parental authority over children's religious behavior, which may explain their absence from syna- gogue activities as well as the growing intergenerational disparity in reli- gious conformity, as reported by Herman.23 It-is not surprising that ten years later Deshen reported that the ethnic synagogue had lost most of its thriving viability.24 Its regulars appeared to be mostly aged, while the younger generations participated only occasionally and mainly at festivals and family celebrations. Interpreting these observations, Deshen employed Sharot's comparison of the level of acculturation with the host culture among Jewish communi- ties in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East.25 Middle Eastern Jewry occupies a midway position on a scale of acculturation whose extremes 21. Similar findings, based upon a study of Yemenites in an urban suburb, were reported by J. Katz and Z.

Sharot argues that the general disposi- tion of the host religious doctrine toward minority religions determined the degree of the Jewish acculturation: the greater the tolerance demonstrated by the host society, the stronger the tendency on the part of the Jewish community toward accommodation with the host doctrine. This analysis is supported by the observation that the traditions, rituals, and beliefs of most Middle Eastern Jewish communities often displayed elements in common with those of their Muslim neighbors. To this assessment of the characteris- tics of the religiosity of Middle Eastern Jews, Deshen adds that oral tradi- tion, as opposed to written tradition, played a greater role in the transmis- sion of Middle Eastern Jewish culture. That is to say, as compared to East European Jews, Middle Eastern Jews were less likely to regard learned texts as depositories of culture. He therefore concluded that the religion of Middle Eastern Jewry was less differentiated externally, vis-ai-vis Gentile culture, as well as internally, from other facets of Jewish culture.26 The conclusions derived from these studies may provide an explanation for the patterns of religious behavior observed among Middle Eastern Jews in Israel. Since they are apparently predisposed to a relatively easy accommo- dation with the cultural pressures of their host society, whether Muslim or Israeli-Ashkenazi, they soon acculturated to the secular culture of the dominant veteran segment of Israeli society and accommodated with no protest to the attitude of superiority demonstrated by the orthodox estab- lishment. An anthropological study which I carried out during the late 1960s and again during the late 1970s among Moroccan immigrants in villages revealed a phenomenon different from what was observed in the town environment. The economic affluence afforded by farming, which eradi- cated the old communal stratification, enabled the families that had once been poor to utilize the religious sphere as a means of displaying their achievements in Israel, as, for example, through the acquisition of expensive Torah scrolls. Moreover, all generations participated regularly in synagogue activities. My observations revealed, however, persistent difficulties in the functioning of the traditional Moroccan religious leaders.27 26. Deshen, "Religion Among Middle Eastern Immigrants," pp. 241-242. 27. Shokeid, The Dual Heritage, and "The Decline of Personal Endowment of Atlas Mountains Religious Leaders in Israel," Anthropological Quarterly 52 (1979): 186-197.</page><page sequence="10">256 MOSHE SHOKEID In many parts of Morocco religious leadership was exercised by scholars whose authority was vested as much in their personal charismatic traits as in their family patrimony (i.e., zekhut avot-"merit of the fathers"). The attri- bute of zekhut avot was hereditary but at the same time was an inherent trait of moral superiority possessed by those who chose the religious calling. Such leaders were not formally appointed and did not receive a regular salary, but they were reputed for their extraordinary deeds and the power of their blessings. The characteristics of this leadership had a parallel in the religious leadership of the Muslim host society: zekhut avot might be compared to baraka ("blessing"), the virtue of sacredness attributed to the Moroccan marabout and his living descendants.28 It was not easy for leaders of this type to accommodate to Israel's bureaucratic religious system. Moreover, while in Morocco the local communities had each supported several religious leaders who catered individually to their clients, in Israel the Ministry of Religious Affairs appoints only one salaried rabbi to each community. The unsuitability of the traditional leaders for this highly formalized system, as well as the tensions and conflicts resulting from the inevitable competition between the candidates who were available for such appointments, often led to the departure of the authentic communal leadership, whose members settled in the more heterogeneously composed new towns. Meanwhile, the ministry appointed its own candidates, who often did not gain the respect and affection of their congregants.29 During the late 1970s I carried out observations in two suburbs of Tel Aviv. One was a decaying public housing project dating from the 1950s. Its residents, of low socioeconomic status, were mainly of Middle Eastern extraction. The second suburb, situated nearby, was mainly composed of privately owned apartments, and its residents, a younger population of both European and Middle Eastern extraction, had moved in since the early 1970s. Eight ethnic synagogues were regularly operating in the old neighbor- hood: one Iranian, one Afghani, one Iraqi, two Egyptian, two East European, and a joint congregation of Tripolitanians and Moroccans.30 Although spacious and richly decorated, the synagogues were usually poor- 28. See, for example, C. Geertz, Islam Observed.- Religious Developments in Morocco and Indonesia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968), p. 50. 29. Shokeid, "Decline of Personal Endowment of Atlas Mountains Religious Leaders." 30. The suburb was mainly settled in the early 1950s, before the major immigration from Morocco in the mid-1950s. Therefore, the small number of residents of Moroccan extraction, who could not establish a separate Moroccan congregation, joined the Tripolitanian syna- gogue.</page><page sequence="11">CULTURAL ETHNICITY IN ISRAEL 257 ly attended by the younger generations, who had moved out to better neigh- borhoods or did not feel obligated to attend services. The scene seemed to confirm Deshen's observations about the decline of ethnic synagogues. Nevertheless, these observations did not appear to represent an irreversible process. In the nearby new neighborhood, I observed two ethnic congrega- tions-one Moroccan and the other Yemenite. The congregants assembled in the local school, where they were allowed to use two classrooms for the daily early morning and evening prayers as well as for the Sabbath and festival services. The congregants were exerting pressures on the Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Tel Aviv Municipal Religious Council to provide the sites and financial means necessary in order to build proper separate synagogues. The Moroccan congregation, which I observed more closely, had been started by a forty-year-old congregant from Casablanca. He was the son of a religious leader in Tafilalt and had brought along a Torah scroll when he came to Israel in the early 1960s. On arrival he had settled in a development town, where he was employed in various teaching and clerical jobs. He moved to Tel Aviv in 1976 and soon after started to organize a minyan (ten adult males) for regular services. At first the minyan met at his home, but with the growth of the congregation it was allowed to operate in the school. In 1979 the congregation already owned four Torah scrolls, which had been provided by the ministry and by individual residents. When I attended Sabbath morning services during July (the peak of the summer season), twenty young and older men were present. The leader told me that usually thirty men attended services regularly, "but now there are some members who prefer to go to the beach." He added that he was careful not to burden the younger congregants with heavy religious demands. He knew that some of them did not wear a skullcap on weekdays and probably drove cars on the Sabbath, "but what is really important is that they come to the synagogue." He also told me that on the High Holidays many more resi- dents of Moroccan extraction asked to participate in the services. On these occasions the services were held in the school's gymnasium. The holiday services provided the congregation with new recruits who sometimes became regulars. He did not hesitate to recruit new congregants whom he knew "were not particularly religious." Thus, for example, a regular con- gregant of about thirty years old told me that he did not wear a skullcap on weekdays but in the last few years had stopped driving his car on the Sabbath. "I keep the tradition which I got at Father's home," he ended as a sort of explanation.</page><page sequence="12">258 MOSHE SHOKEID At the end of Sabbath prayers the congregants went together to perform a short ceremony at the home of a non-member family which was mourning the loss of an elderly relative. On the way the leader mentioned that the congregants and other residents often invited him to perform family rituals and also consulted with him on various personal matters. He ended the conversation with the statement: "They treat me like a rabbi." Although the appearance and bearing of this congregational leader were "modern," his performance was very similar to that of traditional Moroccan religious leaders. His authority was personal, rather than based on formal criteria of learning and ordination, and also seemed to contain some features of zekhut avot. During the High Holidays, the synagogues in the old neighborhood came to life. This phenomenon of religious revival was particularly notice- able among the Iraqi residents. The Iraqi synagogue, which was poorly attended most of the year, was fully packed, including many young adults and youth. Moreover, a new congregation was organized for the holiday season in the gymnasium of the local school. In addition, crowds of men, women, and children gathered around the synagogues during the services, so that each one appeared to be the center of a lively communal festival. Within the synagogues, large sums of money were contributed for the right to perform various honored parts during the service. The emergent congre- gations manifested noticeable features of communal bonds.3' On Succoth (Tabernacles), when the attendance dropped considerably, I carried on a conversation with a group of regular congregants about religious life in Iraq and Israel. The beadle, an impressive man in his early sixties, argued some- what impatiently: "There is no difference; it is all a matter of family com- portment. If the father attends the synagogue, the children go along. But if the mother spends her time playing cards and the father whiles his time away in similar pursuits, the children will do just the same. And there are also the uncles whose behavior carries some influence as well. So you see, it all depends on the blood that runs in the family." He added that attendance at the synagogue in Iraq was also not regular, "but Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are different days!" He was thus implying that in Iraq also, the attendance of congregants on the festivals was much more impressive. 31. This type of High Holidays communal congregation differs from that observed in many Ashkenazi synagogues, where the swollen congregations during the festivals are usually composed of unrelated participants.</page><page sequence="13">CULTURAL ETHNICITY IN ISRAEL 259 Another congregant, in his early fifties, reacted as follows: "In Israel there are many parties [miflagot]: Iraqis, Iranians, Egyptians, etc. Everyone estab- lishes his own synagogue; there is even another Iraqi synagogue here [on the High Holidays]. But on weekdays you can't assemble a minyan!" Although the latter expressed some bitterness about the organization of religious life in Israel, neither man complained about changes in the extent of religiosity among their compatriots, nor did they look back nostalgically. The personal experiences of the historian Y. Nini are revealing in this context, reflecting similar characteristics among Yemenite Jews. He was born in a veteran village of Yemenite residents, which he left at a later stage for a nearby town. He was often questioned by observant older relatives about his absence from the synagogue services on the Sabbath. He answered in astonishment that he could not attend on the Sabbath because of the distance of the synagogue from his home. With no hesitation they suggested that he should come by car and park near the entrance to the village. He was also invited by relatives to participate in the Sabbath and festival services in another village whose residents had arrived from Yemen in 1948. They also suggested that he lead the prayers on the festivals. They knew he could not accept their invitation unless he came by car on these occasions. Eventually he came by car, parking at the center of the village. He was warmly received and was treated during the service as a guest of honor.32 Pertinent support for our observations is provided by Tessler, who carried out a study in Morocco during the early 1970s.33 He reports that most of the Jews who remained in Morocco's towns (many of whom had migrated from villages), "are observant, but often by tradition rather than conviction" (p. 371). Ninety-two percent of his respondents kept kashrut at home, sixty percent attended synagogue every Sabbath, but only twenty- five percent observed the Sabbath strictly. When they were asked to report on aspects of daily life which most frequently reminded them that they were Jewish, the majority pointed out factors relating to family, friends, and the social milieu as often as those relating to worship and observance. This information recalls the many interviews with Jews of Moroccan extraction (the largest group of Middle Eastern immigrants) on Israeli radio and televi- 32. 1 am grateful to Prof. Yehuda Nini of Tel-Aviv University, who gave me permission to publish this information. 33.

The interviewees recurrently confess their attachment to masoret (lit. "tradition"). Such statements are often made by leading young figures who are not considered religious by most listeners and readers. For example, Mr. Shaul Ben-Simhon, president of the Association of Moroccan Jews, stated in a newspaper interview:34 "Although I smoke on the Sabbath, I adhere to tradition [ani mesorati]. I am secularized, nevertheless I fast on Yom Kippur. I attend synagogue during the festivals, and I perform kiddush [the blessing over wine] every Sabbath. I consider the Sabbath feast as holy of holy [kodesh hakodeshim], and I dedicate the Sabbath completely to the family [Shabbat kodesh lamish- pachah]."35 A similar attitude was reported by Mr. Raphael Edri, who at the time of the interview (1979) was the manager of a large national building concern and is presently a Labor member of the Knesset. He also defined himself as "traditional" (mesorati). He told his interviewer36 that, although he drives a car on the Sabbath, he often dons phylacteries.37 "It has been planted in our blood," he explained and continued: "My children attend a secular school, but during the Sabbath feast I make the blessing over the wine and the children wear skullcaps." Most revealing is Aharon Abu Hatzeira, son of the most venerated religious leader of Moroccan Jewry, who at the time of the following observation was serving as minister of reli- gious affairs. At a political rally which he held on the campus of Bar-Ilan University38 before the 1981 general elections, soon after he broke away from Mafdal (the National Religious party), he explained the meaning of the name of the new party he headed, Tami, whose initials stand for Tenu'at Masoret Yisrael (The Movement of Israel's Tradition): "Mafdal opened its ranks to those who observe taryag mitzvot [the 613 command- ments prescribed in the Pentateuch; the word taryag is made up of the Hebrew letters taf = 400, resh = 200, yod = 10, gimmel = 3]. But there are 34. Levy Itzhak Hayerushalmi, Ma'ariv weekend supplement, Nov. 9, 1979, p. 30. 35. The Sabbath ritual and meals are made particularly noticeable by a family's symbolic presentation. Thus, for example, although women are exempt from performing positive pre- cepts whose execution is bound to a specific time, they are obliged to observe the sanctification of the Sabbath. The primary kiddush is recited on the eve of the Sabbath before the start of the meal (see, for example, Encyclopaedia Judaica). 36. Hayerushalmi, Ma'ariv weekend supplement, Nov. 9, 1979, p. 30. 37. It seems that the interviewees attributed an equal value to most religious actions, as well as to their transgressions. Thus, for example, the kiddush, smoking on the Sabbath, fasting on Yom Kippur, the wearing of a skullcap, driving on the Sabbath, and donning phylacteries are presented as equal alternatives. 38.

Why should we close our ranks and exclude them? Tafmitzvot [400 precepts] or resh yod mitzvot [210 precepts] are also sufficient!!" A similar interpretation of Tami's ideology was offered to me by a young school principal whose family arrived in 1956 from the Atlas Mountains: "Tami is a party which cherishes tradition [Tami miflagah mesoratit]. Oriental Jews [edot hamizralh] are not extremists: they did not reside in the ghetto. If the Arab grew long hair, the Jew cut his hair and left a beard only. If the Arab wore a white gown, the Jew wore a black gown instead. But the Jew lived with [hai 'im] the Arab!" Referring to the complex reality of Jewish life in many Muslim countries, he was describing both a philosophy and a strategy of existence which had sustained Jewish cultural survival through an unabashed accommodation with social and cultural constraints (as forcefully phrased in his statement: "But the Jew lived with the Arab"). He was at the same time implying that the Ashkenazim tend toward extremism, as demonstrated both by their orthodoxy and by their secularism.39 Quite in line with this type of religiosity is the continuing popularity, particularly among North African Jews, of pilgrimages to the tombs of venerated scholars and saints, whether of ancient or more recent vintage. This phenomenon has been noticeable since the first years of immigration, the period which seemed to reflect most profoundly the weakening of reli- gion in the life of Middle Eastern Jewry. Thus, for example, by the early 1960s the pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Simon bar Yohai in Meron on Lag B'Omer was already the largest spontaneous gathering in the country. More than 100,000 pilgrims, the majority of Moroccan extraction, came to the annual celebration.40 Tunisian Jews also hold lavish celebrations in honor of their late scholars.41 The pilgrimages and celebrations attracted a 39. He went on to explain the pattern of voting in his village (composed of Moroccan settlers), which was divided between Tami and Likud (Premier Begin's party coalition). He thought that those who voted for Likud had acted against their own economic interests, since as farmers they were more likely to prosper under a Labor government, "but the propaganda presented the Labor party as the old Mapai [the Labor party, mainly under Ben-Gurion's leadership]. Mapai represents secularization! This is the party which, many years ago when the settlers arrived in the country, was suspected of prohibiting the learning of the Torah and which was enthusiastic in conscripting girls to the army." In accordance with this interpretation, the Labor party was now rejected because of its image as representing extreme secularism. 40.

Drawn, among other things, by the entertainment and social activities which the gatherings offered, the younger people were participating in these activities at the very time when they were neglecting synagogue life (as indicated by Deshen). The popularity of the pilgrimages continued in spite of the objections of the religious estab- lishment, which also in North Africa had unsuccessfully objected to this phenomenon of folk religion. Manifestations of folk religion have not decreased since the 1960s. On the contrary, new pilgrimage sites have become popular. Particularly noteworthy are the North African scholars and saints whose spirits have apparently moved to Israel in recent years, as revealed in the dreams of their disciples. Ben-Ami, for example, observed that the worship of saints intensifies in times of crisis.42 Immediately after the 1973 war he recorded instances of young soldiers and their parents expressing gratitude to family saints for the miracles they had performed on the battlefield. Besides the spontaneous revival of traditional patterns of folk religion, a new type of ethnic-religious celebration has been evolving since the late 1960s: the Moroccan Memuna, the Kurdish Saharanei, and the Iranian Ruze- Baque. Although based on traditional elements, these celebrations have been greatly encouraged by the Israeli political establishment.43 The largest celebration, the Memuna, on the day after Passover, has been held in Jerusalem.44 The Saharanei celebration, which began during the 1970s, is held during Succoth at a more secluded country site.45 The Ruze-Baque, the most recent of the celebrations, is also held on the day after Passover, in Ramat-Gan's National Park. These gatherings, which originally were family and communal events, have been transformed into nationwide ethnic-political festivals. They are regularly attended by national leaders and politicians, including the president, the prime minister, and the leader of the opposition. Although the activities at these celebrations bear little resemblance to the traditional family and communal festivities in Morocco, 42. 1.

This heritage is so intertwined with the religious aspects of the celebrations46 that in 1980, accepting the inevitable, the Sephardi chief rabbi publicly gave his blessing to the Memuna.47 Familial and Communal Anchorage of Religious Action The data suggest that religious vitality differs according to the extent of homogeneity or heterogeneity in the ethnic composition of settlements. Thus, a larger percentage of youth seem to participate in synagogue life among ethnic groups whose members are more concentrated in villages or urban suburbs.48 But religion is not dying out with the passing of the older generation in the more heterogeneous settlements. Despite the shattering cultural crisis that Middle Eastern Jewry experienced in Israel, which involved, among other things, a depreciation in the status of their religious leaders and a diminution in the authority of religious observances in daily life, the religious domain still forms an important element in the cognitive, perceptive, and affective layers of social existence for a considerable portion of Middle Eastern Jewry. In order to clarify these propositions we will first elaborate the sociologi- cal definition which indicates the features of religious activity among Middle Eastern Jews. The definition, largely developed by Deshen, relates to the minimal differentiation of religion from other cultural domains among Middle Eastern Jews.49 This definition, which has greatly contributed to our understanding of Middle Eastern Jewish religiosity, fails, however, to con- sider the extent and the consequences of Middle Eastern Judaism's anchor- age in the family and the community web of commitments. We argue that this type of lesser differentiation between religion and other social domains, which has deeply anchored Middle Eastern Judaism in familial and com- munal action, offers the religious domain indispensable support under 46. The Ruze-Baque, however, does not as yet carry any noticeable symbols of religious life. 47. There are two chief rabbis in the country, an Ashkenazi and a Sephardi. This system of rabbinical leadership was established during the British Mandate in Palestine. 48. This may explain, for example, the higher frequency of self-designations as religious among Yemenite youth as opposed to North Africans and members of other groups. 49. Deshen, "Religion Among Middle Eastern Immigrants in Israel," p. 241.</page><page sequence="18">264 MOSHE SHOKEID changing circumstances that deprive religion of many of its own resources. This perspective on the structure and content of religious action leads us toward a different interpretation of contemporary observations of Middle Eastern Jewish religiosity and toward a different evaluation of the prospects for religious life among Middle Eastern Jewry. In Muslim countries, several factors related to the social environment and to material existence lent much binding force to the individual's familial and communal commitments. Genealogical bonds and territorial ascription were among the most important indicators of the social position of the individual in Muslim society.50 Although the Jews did not adopt the ideolo- gical elements that sustained this system, the organizational components of the host society were, nevertheless, incorporated to some extent into Jewish society. The importance of genealogical and territorial bonds was particu- larly noticeable in small, remote, and isolated Jewish communities. More- over, in many parts of the Muslim world, the weakness of the central politi- cal organization was reflected in the inability of the Jews to develop national or regional organizations. These constraints naturally buttressed the familial and communal dimensions in the composition of the individual's Jewish identity. The essential position of the family and the community is also indicated in the style of Middle Eastern synagogue services; for example, the seating arrangements, and the social activities that take place in the synagogue. Thus, all congregants, including children, participate as soloists in leading sections of the service, regardless of their musical skills or religious competence. The congregants are mainly seated along the walls of the synagogue hall facing each other, in contrast to the seating arrangements in Ashkenazi synagogues, where the congregants sit in rows facing the holy ark, and consequently can only observe the backs of most of the other congregants. Similarly, in the Middle Eastern synagogue service, those who have been called to take part in the reading of the scrolls of the Law make a round of the hall and greet each congregant before returning to their seats. The various modes of greeting (e.g., shaking hands, kissing cheeks, kissing on the brow) reflect the particular relationship with each congregant: kinship, friendship, and deference.5 Traditionally, the old men in the 50.

The deference expressed toward the old men buttressed their position as heads of their families and enforced family loyalties. Economic life, however, more directly affected the patterns of religious life, social comportment, and identity. Itinerant peddlers and craftsmen who stayed for days, weeks, and even months with their Muslim clients could not regularly participate in synagogue life.52 These difficulties were acknow- ledged by local religious leaders, as shown, for example, by the exception made by a Sefrou scholar for employees who could not attend public prayers.53 Moreover, we do not find among Middle Eastern Jews pressures similar to those prevalent in European Jewish society regarding the severe avoidance of social relations with Gentiles, which aimed in Europe at maintaining religious and social barriers even when Jews were obligated to associate with Gentiles.54 The data which I collected among Jews from southern Morocco demonstrate the frequent and relaxed contacts with Muslim patrons, neighbors, and clients. Since the religious leaders in the tribal and rural areas were not given full financial support by their commu- nities, they too were usually obliged to interact regularly with Muslims with whom they had an economic relationship. Therefore, the religious leader- ship was not as remote as the European Jewish leadership from the reality of mutual relationships between Jews and Gentiles. Also, in their physical appearance and clothing the Jews in the Middle East were not ostentatiously different from their neighbors, unlike orthodox Jewry in Europe for many generations.55 These observations indicate that Middle East Jewry did not Press, 1967-83); 2:145; M.

The religious culture of Middle Eastern Jews, particularly in North Africa, was probably influenced by the Sephardi tradition developed by the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula until their expulsion in 1492. It was this tradition that also contributed to a more accommodating approach to the surrounding society and culture.56 Sharot and Deshen analyzed the close affinity of Middle Eastern Jewry to the culture of their host society in terms of its impact on the patterns and content of their religious activities.57 My approach, however, emphasizes the relevance of this affinity in generating a mode of religiosity that is highly interwoven with the individual's bonds of family and community affiliation. Moreover, in spite of the economic, social, and political changes they under- went prior to their immigration to Israel (such as those following the process of urbanization in Morocco), Middle Eastern Jews still represented to a great extent a homogeneous society, in terms of a shared world view, main- tained by all classes, in which a prominent position was occupied by the familial, communal, and religious realms. Although the same processes of social differentiation and communal disintegration that had occurred much earlier in European Jewry had already begun in some parts of Middle Eastern Jewish society, their impact and consequences were not, as yet, comparable. Similarly, while the close-knit kin and community networks of Middle Eastern Jewry disintegrated somewhat as a result of immigration, the extent of dispersion and actual decline of the family and community was by no means so pronounced as among European Jews in Israel. The immi- gration from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century was usually composed of individuals and small families, and this became irreversible as a consequence of the Holocaust. In stark contrast, Middle Eastern Jewry's immigration was usually composed of communities in their entirety. Although these communities often became dispersed in Israel, and in spite of the various constraints that affected the daily life of the immigrants and their offspring in their new environment, the individual Israeli of Middle 56.

No doubt, the impact of religious obligations and the authority of religious leaders have greatly diminished, but the intensity and scope of family and communal ties, which have been traditionally interwoven with religious activities and meanings, have provided an important source for a diffused identification with religious symbols and an incentive for partial participa- tion in religious activities at this stage of societal reorganization. The interpretations suggested by Sharot and Deshen for the apparently easy accommodation of Middle Eastern Jews with the secular culture of Ash- kenazi Jews59 ignore the impact exerted by the factors of familial and communal commitments in the process of religious change and adjustment among Middle Eastern Jews versus Ashkenazi Jews. The lack of powerful family and communal orientations may offer an explanation for the dominant patterns of religiosity among Ashkenazi Jews in Israel, which do not encourage the modes of "partial religiosity." It should be emphasized, however, that the Ashkenazi scene in Israel is considerably different from that in the United States and Western Europe, where partial religiosity is acceptable to the Reform and Conservative denominations and is not con- sistently denounced by the Orthodox sector.60 58. For my observations on the intensity of the feelings expressed during reunions of rela- tives who had settled in different localities, see Shokeid, "Evolution of Kinship Ties among Moroccan Immigrants," in The Predicament of Homecoming, pp. 210-236.

During my stay in Britain in the 1960s I observed the phenomenon of selective preserva-</page><page sequence="22">268 MOSHE SHOKEID Particularly revealing have been our observations of the expressions of tolerance by Middle Eastern Jews toward partial participation in synagogue life. The attitudes of the leader of the Moroccan congregation that I observed in the new Tel-Aviv suburb are reminiscent of the attitudes expressed by Moroccan leaders in earlier generations, as, for example, the Sefrou scholar mentioned above who made allowances for congregants who could not easily attend prayer services. The mere identification of indivi- duals with the synagogue congregation through partial participation, with- out acceptance of the full range of mitzvot in public and at home, was accorded by the leader a religious value in a scale of religiosity which ranks and rewards every believer according to his particular existential circum- stances. The congregants perceive this scale as the natural order of religious life which endows contemporary leaders, as well as the scholars and saints of the past, with the spiritual power to supplement their religious deficiencies. These figures provide seasonal opportunities for religious elevation, as, for example, during the pilgrimages to the saint's tombs and other celebrations. This mode of religiosity is characterized by spiritual and emotional involvement and the notion of belonging, rather than by the strict practice of religious observances. The general reaction of Middle Eastern Jewish religious leaders seem to provide some support for this approach. Even those of them who succeeded in preserving their leadership status in Israel did not encourage the kind of isolationist tendencies or more aggressive manifestations among their followers that are observed among certain segments of Ashkenazi orthodoxy. This accommodating reaction does not by any means imply that the Middle Eastern leadership is weak or has lost control under the new circumstances. Nonetheless, it is difficult for those whose expectations and evaluations of religious comportment are anchored in the Israeli Ashkenazi tradition to comprehend this seeming religious tion of certain elements of religious life among the second generation of immigrants from Eastern Europe in Salford, where many Jews have concentrated. Successfully integrated in British economy and society, secular in their appearance in public and at home, they are also integrated in a close-knit network of family ties and community activities. They often partici- pate in the Sabbath and festival services of Orthodox synagogues and preserve considerable elements of the customs related to the Sabbath and festival meals. Professor Jacob Katz has informed me that more recently, with the growing institutionalization of the yeshivot, their protagonists have started to protest and raise doubts about the value of partial observance. My experience in Salford, however, supports the hypothesis that wherever the individual remains embedded within a relatively close framework of familial and communal ties, he tends also to keep at least a partial commitment to religious traditon.</page><page sequence="23">CULTURAL ETHNICITY IN ISRAEL 269 tolerance and the modest religious demands presented to the congregants in daily life. From the Ashkenazi perspective, there is not much religious substance in the selective preservation of religious observances that are mainly of folkloric value. The low evaluation in religious terms accorded to the modes of behavior reported here leads naturally to the conclusion that we are actually witnessing a process of secularization. Masoret Religiosity and Ethnic Action Beyond the possible debate about the religious value to be accorded them, Middle Eastern patterns of religiosity may indeed express distinct symbols of an ethnic culture. Congenial circumstances for the development of that symbolic estate are provided by certain structural factors, and parti- cularly by the tendency of Middle Eastern Jews to concentrate geographical- ly in villages, development towns, and urban suburbs. Moreover, this concentration in ethnic neighborhoods is associated with a shared socio- economic status among residents.61 Masoret religiosity as here described may both express and satisfy the growing dissatisfaction among Middle Eastern Jews and their increasingly more outspoken demand that their culture be recognized as a legitimate alternative to dominant Ashkenazi culture which is supposed to represent Israeli society. The melting pot ideology in Israel, as in other countries, has apparently aimed at social unifi- cation through a single, homogeneous culture. This ideology aimed no less at the quick acculturation of the recently arrived groups, whose members were often considered backward and traditional, into the social order and the cultural repertoire of the dominant veteran sectors. Secularization has been one of the most noticeable characteristics of the veteran Israelis of Ash- kenazi extraction. It was they who staffed the governmental, municipal, Jewish Agency, and party bureaucracies that monopolized and allocated to the immigrants the major resources of livelihood and prestige. Among these bureaucracies the Labor party, which ruled the country for many years, was particularly influential. Actually, Middle Eastern Jews could usually choose between two alternatives offered, if not forced on them, by the Ashkenazi political establishment: firstly, the secular parties (preferably Labor), and 61. For an analysis of the phenomenon of ethnicity in American cities in terms of structural factors, see Yancey, Ericksen, and Juliani, "Emergent Ethnicity."</page><page sequence="24">270 MOSHE SHOKEID secondly, the religious parties (preferably Mafdal). Therefore, it is not surprising that Tami, an ethnic party that went to the polls for the first time in 1981 and showed better prospects than any other ethnic party that has emerged since 1948, has chosen to identify itself by the term masoret.62 The emergence and disappearance of ethnic parties in Israel has usually been analyzed in terms of situational factors.63 Although we are not con- cerned here with the factors that triggered Tami's appearance on the politi- cal scene, nor with its future prospects, it is important to emphasize the cultural dimension, for we believe that it buttressed the personal and intra- party situation that led to the new party. Moreover, the same cultural dimension apparently also affected the results obtained at the polls by other parties. The new party's choice of its name appears to be consistent with our observations of the wide use of the term masoret by Middle Eastern Jews in explaining their religious situation. The concept of masoret conveys the symbols of a religio-familial-communal culture which is supposed to include also those who observe only taf mitzvot or resh yod mitzvot, as was openly declared by the party's leader. Thus, addressing itself to the vast constituency of Middle Eastern Jews, Tami made itself the representative of a distinct culture different from both the Ashkenazi secular culture, which has conspicuously and aggressively dissociated itself from traditional Judaism, and the Ashkenazi exclusivist orthodoxy, which compulsively observes taryag mitzvot.64 The symbols and messages utilized by Tami offered indications about the characteristics of the cultural aspect of the developing ethnic-political framework of contemporary Israeli society. Emergent ethnicity in Israel and elsewhere often seems to be a temporary phenomenon, as usually suggested by contemporary research. Thus, for example, it provides the first generation of immigrants with an instrumental means for claiming a larger share of public resources, and the third genera- 62. The election advertisements of Tami utilized the slogan "masoret is the thread which links all edot [ethnic groups]"; see, for example, Ma'ariv, June 11, 1981. The edot were identi- fied in another advertisement as follows: "... those who came from North Africa, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, India, Cochin, Kurdistan, Yemen, and other Diaspora lands"; see, for example, Yediot Ahronot, June 12, 1981. 63. For a recent analysis of Israeli ethnic parties, see H. Herzog, "The Ethnic Lists to the Delegates' Assembly and the Knesset (1920-1977): Ethnic Political Identity?"

The new party, Shas, was headed by Sephardi Orthodox leaders.</page><page sequence="25">ETHNICITY IN ISRAEL 271 tion with a nostalgic return to their ancestral culture.65 I do not claim that the emergent ethnicity is a revival of an authentic ethnic heritage. It certainly is not, though it reflects traditional elements and influences. Nor is it the mere ephemeral outcome of structural opportunities,66 or a primarily leisure-time activity of a working-class culture,67 though it has certainly been influenced by structural opportunities and does sustain a type of leisure-time activity that often characterizes "working classes." The fact that "ethnic" and "working-class" cultural manifestations often filter upward (e.g., American black folk culture) indicates their role in creating new symbols which also attract the mainstream and may eventually be transformed into major national cultural symbols. The masoret religiosity adopted and proclaimed by Middle Eastern Jews, which has been influenced by their diaspora heritage as much as by their family, community, residen- tial, and other structural opportunities in Israel, may under certain circum- stances develop into a symbolic linkage with the more dominant cultural stream. With the growing disparity between the expanding Ashkenazi orthodoxy and the dominant secular sector, on the one hand, and the grow- ing notion of cultural need concerning the symbolic realm of Jewish identity in the secular sector, on the other, masoret religiosity may be more than an ethnic peculiarity. Regardless of its possibly temporary nature, emergent ethnicity could have an important impact on mainstream culture,68 much beyond what has usually been assumed.
