<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY JUDAH HALEVI'S THE KUZARI IN FRENCH by SEYMOUR FELDMAN Charles Touati, trans. Le Kuzari: Apologie de la religion mdprisee. Louvain: Peeters, 1994. xvi, 252 pp. A year before his death in 1141, the great Hebrew poet of medieval Sephardic Jewry Judah Halevi wrote a prose work in which he took up his pen on behalf of Judaism. Written during the Second Crusade, the Kuzari reflects not only the conflict between Christianity and Islam, but also the current precarious position of Jewry, especially at the time of the Spanish Reconquista. Unlike most Jewish polemical works, the Kuzari is written in the form of a dialogue. In this respect it resembles Peter Abelard's Dialogue Between a Philosopher, Jew and Christian, written about the same time. What makes the Kuzari especially interesting, and perhaps unique, as a polemical work is that it is rooted in historical fact: there was a Khazar nation located in southern Russia whose ruling class had converted to Judaism during the eighth century. Over time a tradition had developed that the conversion was the result of a debate amongst representatives of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Halevi used this piece of historical fact and legend as the stage-setting for his apologia for Judaism. But he made one significant change: he added a philosopher to the debate. Indeed, as one reads the treatise, one sees quite clearly that Halevi was more worried about the threat of philosophy to Judaism than he was about the challenges posed by Christianity and Islam. After all, the latter admitted that in some sense Judaism was true; philosophy, as Halevi understood it, denied or was skeptical AJS Review 21/1 (1996): 119-123 119</page><page sequence="2">120 SEYMOUR FELDMAN about the truth of any revealed religion. That the philosopher speaks first in the debate and soon leaves is misleading: his presence is felt throughout the treatise; indeed, there is more discussion of philosophy in books 4 and 5 of the work than in books 1-3. Halevi's anxiety about philosophy parallels the Muslim Al-Ghazzali's concern a half-century earlier; in fact, several scholars have argued for the influence of Al-Ghazzali upon Halevi. Be that as it may, it is certain that Halevi wants to draw a sharp distinction between prophetic truth and philosophical speculation, which, he claims, is really irrelevant to religion even when true. Accordingly, Halevi is a medieval thinker whom modems of a certain persuasion should welcome, especially those who are fond of Kierkegaard, Buber, or Wittgenstein. Written in a beautiful classical Arabic, the Kuzari was translated into Hebrew shortly after its initial appearance by the "father of translators," Judah ibn Tibbon. However, it was not too popular, since it appeared at the high point of Jewish Aristotelianism. For a more positive reception it had to wait until the Renaissance, especially in Italy, where in a Platonist-humanist environment it fared better, receiving its most detailed commentary at the hands of the Mantuan rabbi Judah Moscato (fl. latter half of 15th cent.). Since then the Kuzari has become a classic of medieval Hebrew literature and Jewish religious thought. Yet the contemporary reader who has no Arabic or Hebrew has been frustrated. For in spite of the Kuzari's established position in Jewish literature, it did not fare well in the hands of its translators or editors. The Kuzari was translated into Latin (1660) and Spanish (1663); in the latter half of the nineteenth century David Cassel rendered it into German. But all these translations were made from the Hebrew translation of ibn Tibbon, which itself had not yet received a critical edition. In 1887 Hartwig Hirschfeld published the first critical edition of the Arabic text along with a revised text of the ibn Tibbon translation. In 1905 he published an English translation, which has been reissued recently by Schocken. Partial translations have appeared in French by M. Ventura (1932) and in English by I. Heinemann (1947); but only the latter is available in print. So for one who reads no Arabic or Hebrew the only options have been Hirschfeld's English translation or Heinemann's selections; or one could try to get Cassel's German rendition at a good university library. (The late Lawrence Berman began a new English</page><page sequence="3">THE KUZARI IN FRENCH 121 translation, but it was unfinished at the time of his untimely death; it is now being completed by Barry Kogan.) Things changed radically twenty years ago when David Baneth's critical edition of the Arabic text was published posthumously in Jerusalem (1976). Although he made use of Hirschfeld's edition, Baneth utilized the corrigenda suggested by several scholars who had closely examined Hirschfeld's text shortly after it appeared. An excellent Arabist and medievalist, Baneth supplemented these corrections with his own emendations and supplied a new critical apparatus. His edition is truly the critical edition of the Kuzari. Four years earlier, however, a new Hebrew translation had been published in Tel Aviv by Judah ibn Shmuel. This Hebrew version was based upon the earlier corrections of Hirschfeld as well as the unpublished Arabic text of Baneth and the critical editing of the ibn Tibbon translation by such scholars as A. Zifroni. This new Hebrew edition, which is available both in hardcover and paperback, has several virtues: an informative introduction, useful notes, and valuable glossaries and indices. Nevertheless, the translation itself has some vices, particularly its reordering of paragraphs and frequent paraphrasing. For all these reasons Charles Touati's new French translation of the Kuzari is most welcome. Based upon Baneth's Arabic edition as well as a comparative analysis of the ibn Tibbon translation, it satisfies the two essential criteria that a good translation ought to satisfy: (1) fidelity to the original language and thought of the text; and (2) readability in the language of the translation. Its accuracy is clearly superior to all existing versions. Touati's French reads smoothly and felicitously. Quite valuable are his notes, which frequently clarify difficult textual problems in the Arabic and ibn Tibbon texts. He has also provided a brief introduction describing the main themes in Halevi's conception of Judaism. Touati is presently preparing a comprehensive study of Halevi's religious thought. The best way to see the significance of this translation is to juxtapose several passages from the French and English translations. 1. Since one of the main bones of contention between philosophy and revealed religion is the very possibility of revelation, it is crucial to have all those passages in the Kuzari that deal with this issue accurately translated. Let us look at 1.6: Hirschfeld: If anyone is to be guided in matters divine, and to be convinced that God speaks to man, whilst he considers it to be improbable, he must be</page><page sequence="4">122 SEYMOUR FELDMAN convinced of it by himself by means of generally known facts, which allow no refutation, and particularly imbue him with the belief that God has spoken to man. Touati: "Si l'on d6sire diriger quelqu'un dans la parole de Dieu et lui faire admettre comme vrai que Dieu parle l'homme, ce qu'il tient pour improbable, on doit lui presenter des preuves manifestes et irrefutables; et encore se laissera-t-il difficilement persuader que Dieu a parld a un mortel. The Arabic term wa-bil-'hray which introduces the italicized phrase in the translations above is not properly rendered in Hirschfeld nor in any of the ibn Tibbon versions. This term implies a reservation. Thus, the phrase is to be rendered as: "nevertheless, he will allow himself to be persuaded only with difficulty that God speaks to a mortal" (my translation of Touati's French). This important qualification is lost in the English translation. 2. In 1:15 the Rabbi responds to the King's criticism that his opening speech lacks universal theological content and unduly focuses upon particular historical facts as follows: Hirschfeld: Surely, the beginning of my speech was just the proof, and so evident that it requires no other argument. Heinemann: But the beginning of my speech was the very proof, yea the evidence ... Touati: Mais c'est justement mon pr6amble qui constitue ma d6monstration: je me fondais sur l'exp6rience sensible que se passe de preuves et de demonstra- tion. The two English translations, as well as ibn Shmuel's Hebrew version, fail to bring out Halevi's important point that for the Jew historical facts directly experienced, and not theological arguments, are the proof of Judaism. Touati's French accurately and nicely expresses the original Arabic, which I render as follows: "The beginning of my speech is the proof; indeed, it is the sensible experience, which dispenses with inference and demonstration. 3. 4:3 is one of the most important passages in the entire treatise. There Halevi presents his view of prophetic cognition. He wants to stress the fact that the prophet is capable of having a direct, immediate "acquaintance" with God, whereas the philosopher can only know God by abstract reasoning and description. The passage is translated as follows: Hirschfeld: It [the divine] can be designated by prophetic or visionary means.</page><page sequence="5">THE KUZARI IN FRENCH 123 Heinemann: No, God can be designated by Prophetic vision and through the spirit. Touati: Eh bien, il ist vis6 par le vision proph6tique et le regard int6rieur. Although Heinemann's "through the spirit" takes a stab at the original, Hirschfeld misses the mark altogether. The Arabic bastra refers to a mental insight or intuition, which Touati's "regard int6rieur" approximates more closely. 4. At the end of 4:3 Halevi discusses the significance of the Tetra- grammaton, which Israelites pronounce as "Adonai." The true pronunciation and meaning of the Tetragrammaton were known only by the prophets and the high priest. Halevi uses this point to again differentiate prophecy from philosophy. Hirschfeld: Adonai ... points to something which stands at such an immea- surable altitude that a real designation is impossible. Indication is possible in one direction only. Touati: Le nom Adonay ... est comme la vis6e d'une certaine entit6 concrete, bien que, en soi, Dieu soit trop 61ev6 pour 8tre vis6 comme un etre concret; toute perception du concret, en effet, n'appr6hende qu'un aspect parmi d'autres (bi-jihatin duna jiha). Here Halevi is pointing to the extreme difficulty of speaking about God, especially when we do not know His proper name. At best we can refer to God by a name that is a kind of alias enabling us to know God in some way or another. For example, as Adonai we know God to be merciful; as Elohim we refer to God as just. This important point is correctly brought out in Touati's translation but is utterly lost or garbled in the English of Hirschfeld. (Nor is it correctly rendered by ibn Shmuel.) These passages clearly show the virtues of Touati's translation. At present it is the most reliable and readable version of the Kuzari. Indeed, it is a model for all future translations of works of this genre. We owe him a great debt. Rutgers University New Brunswick, N.J.</page></plain_text>
