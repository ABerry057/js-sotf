Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990. xii, 312 pp. Daughters of the Shtetl is a fascinating, well-written account of the work- ing lives of Jewish immigrant women. It is based on archival material, including contemporary newspaper accounts and extensive oral histories. This is a tale about how East European Jewish immigrant women evolved from their lives in the shtetl to working in the garment industry, their pri- mary employment outside the home in the United States. Susan Glenn satisfactorily addresses the question as to why Jewish women were much more active in the labor movement than other women, even though they withdrew from the ?workforce more often than other</page><page sequence="2">344 BOOK REVIEWS women when they married, and thus wage work was merely a transitory phase between childhood and marriage. She demonstrates that their union involvement was not due to a feminist ideology or a sense of identification with other women. It was, rather, due to a a sense of participation or shared experience in family economic matters with male family members that was part of the unique Jewish social and economic relationship in the shtetl. This is an important insight that puts into sharper focus the different response of Jewish women to economic and demographic factors, and that has influenced their descendants over the past century. The tale begins in the late-nineteenth-century Eastern European shtetl where Jewish women, both wives and daughters, were expected to work, in part as a way of helping their fathers, brothers, and husbands pursue the socially more important function that was reserved for men, religious stud- ies. If it was perfectly proper for a highly esteemed scholar's wife to work, so too could the wives of the less scholarly or nonscholarly. Shtetl work sheltered women from the supervision of men other than their fathers and husbands. It "protected" the modesty of married women and the sanctity of marriage. The women worked at "home." They tended the family business or their own small enterprise. Manufacturing or handi- craft work was typically done under the "putting out" or "homework" sys- tem, where the skilled and unskilled tasks were done at home, often in a family setting. Garment work was paramount in manufacturing, where pro- ductivity soared after the introduction of the Singer sewing machine in Eastern Europe in the 1870s. Jewish immigration to America was in a family context, even if staggered over several years, and was viewed as a permanent migration. Economic opportunities differed in the United States, where the "putting out" system was on the wane, but factory garment work was growing. Jewish wives again avoided wage labor and had very low labor force participation rates. More so than other immigrant women, they continued to work at "home," taking in boarders or lodgers, working in the declining "putting out" system and in managing their own or the family's "business." Immigrant daughters, on the other hand, were expected to work until they married and were drawn into the garment factories by the relatively higher wages. Glenn nicely documents that the dichotomy of mothers (wives) at home and daughters (single women) at work in the labor market was more intense among Jews than among other immigrant groups. This is a</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 345 pattern that appears to have continued among successive generations of Jewish women born in the United States. The greater presence of Jewish mothers in the home undoubtedly contributed to the future success of their children in school and in the labor market. The garment industry was characterized by low capital intensity and was dominated by small firms and extensive formal and informal subcontract- ing. The market for the product was intensely competitive, as was the mar- ket for labor. The change in production techniques over time required rela- tively fewer skilled workers. Wages were low and working conditions were hard, but frequent job mobility and informal information networks meant that workers received the highest wages available. The larger garment factories proved to be more attractive to the immi- grant daughters than the smaller garment shops. The factories offered some- what higher wages, steadier work, and occupational mobility, but according to Glenn, perhaps most important was cultural mobility, that is, modernity, freedom, escape from the immigrant ghetto, the shtetl world. According to Glenn, the hardships of garment factory life, socialist inclinations carried with the Jewish immigrant family from Eastern Europe, the knowledge that there was to be little return migration to Europe, the greater personal free- dom allowed unmarried Jewish women, and the continued sense of shared economic relationship with the males in their families spurred their interest in unionization. This book is a valuable contribution to the history of turn-of-the- century Jewish immigrants, as well as to Jewish feminist and labor history. Barry R.
