Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1989. 308 pp. For the Jews of modern Europe and America, the struggle to define an identity that legitimated both Jewish particularism and civic equality and prepared the way both for full participation in the larger society and for Jewish survival has been an ongoing theme of the past two centuries. Each Jewish community has played out this struggle in a different context, shaped by its own social characteristics and the political and cultural contours of the surrounding society. Despite the attention paid to French Jewry because of its pioneer status as the first emancipated Jewish population, this is the first book to offer a comprehensive discussion of the ideology of emancipa- tion and its impact as it developed in France from the age of Enlightenment until the emergence of the Third Republic a century later. By focusing on the ideology of emancipation and its implementation by Jewish leaders, Berkovitz offers a nuanced, richly documented, and always intelligent interpretation of the formation of modern French Jewry. Berkovitz advances historical scholarship on French Jewry by tracing the concept of rgenderation as the central self-proclaimed task of the French Jewish elite, adopted from the Enlightenment critique of European Jewry and advanced as a necessity for accommodation to the demands of citizen- ship. Regrettably, he does not incorporate the recent scholarship on the influential role of the rhetoric of regeneration in the political culture of the French Revolution. However, he deftly demonstrates the continued impact of the concept for more than two generations among French Jewish intellec- tuals and communal activists. He also discusses its expansion from initial concern with socioeconomic change, especially the abandonment of petty commerce and moneylending, and the acquisition of secular culture to issues</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 111 of reform of the public expression of Judaism in France. Although he is in familiar territory when discussing the literature of the 1780s and the Revolu- tion, he presents new and interesting analyses of the continued public debate on the Jews well into the nineteenth century. He succeeds in locating the evolution of French Jewish thought within the context of the French intel- lectual and political milieu and under the influence of the German Has- kalah. He is sensitive as well to the regional variations in Jewish behavior. In exploring what he calls "the ideological foundations of institutional activi- ties and the debate or resistance they provoked" (p. 16), he fills a gap in the intellectual history of the Jews of France. Although Berkovitz argues persuasively the centrality of the theme of regeneration among French Jewish leaders, it is not clear that the various intellectuals, publicists, and consistorial lay leaders who promoted a revised version of regeneration in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s actually constituted a movement, as he contends, especially since one or another of their pro- grams, such as the value of secular education, was accepted by virtually all articulate French Jews by the 1840s. Moreover, the loose coterie of regend- rateurs debated among themselves both specific policies and the tactics to follow to achieve the general goals of a French Jewish community endowed with self-respect and adapted to the demands of citizenship in a modern state. Their shared vision of a unified French Jewish community, with one public rite that would express itself in the Sephardi pronunciation of Hebrew, does not in itself seem sufficient to define them as a movement. Moreover, Berkovitz's assertion that after mid-century the focus of regene- ration shifted from the goal of social integration to "an inner directed cohesiveness" (p. 243) is not adequately supported with evidence. Berkovitz makes an important contribution to French Jewish historio- graphy with his chapters on Jewish education in the nineteenth century and on the process of religious reform. His analysis of the role of modern Jewish primary schools in the forging of a modern Franco-Jewish identity that respected the authority of Jewish tradition breaks new ground. It moves beyond ideology to demonstrate how communal leaders, with the coopera- tion of the state, were able to realize their ideological goals through the establishment and supervision of new institutions. His treatment of the transformation of rabbinical training through the replacement of yeshiva study with a modern rabbinical school makes a similar point. Finally, his discussion of the moderate nature of religious reform in France pays appro- priate attention to the factors that distinguished the French situation from</page><page sequence="3">112 BOOK REVIEWS the German, in particular the early achievement of emancipation and the centralization of authority in the consistories. The first divorced the issue of religious reform from the question of "worthiness" for political equality; the second necessitated taking into account the sensibilities of the traditionalist Jews, particularly of Alsace and Lorraine, and their rabbis, in order to main- tain at least a modicum of social harmony within French Jewish communi- ties. Berkovits also highlights the role of centrist rabbis, concerned with the growing disaffection of youth from Judaism, who mediated between their more traditional colleagues and lay proponents of far-reaching reforms. Berkovitz is on less firm ground, it seems to me, in his evaluation of the impact of both French anti-Semitism and missionary activity upon French Jewry in the middle decades of the nineteeth century. Although nineteenth- century French Jews were, like Jews elsewhere, concerned about Christian attempts to convert Jews and reacted with consternation to the few notori- ous cases of conversion among the Jewish elite in the second quarter of the century, Berkovitz himself admits that missionizing among French Jews was not particularly successful. There was no wave of Jewish apostasy in France. Anti-Semitism, to be sure, did not disappear in France in the years before 1870, but its manifestations, which were sporadic rather than endemic, did not stand in the way of the increasing social integration of French Jews. The new vigor with which Jews defended Judaism in debates with Catholic spokesmen from the 1840s on can be interpreted as a sign of growing secur- ity rather than as a response to "aggressive missionary activity" (p. 237). And it is questionable whether the political activism of French Jews in defense of the rights of Jews abroad, largely through the Alliance Israelite Universelle, was motivated by "a sense of shared destiny, a commonality between the French and foreign conditions" due to the fact that "French Jews were themselves subjected to ... flagrant attacks" (p. 245). The story that Berkovitz tells lends itself to other interpretations but also suggests that the significance of mid-nineteenth-century anti-Semitism in France is still a matter of debate. Finally, there are a number of minor errors in this account of the evolu- tion of French Jewry. Betting de Lancastel's 1824 book about the socio- economic situation of Jews in Alsace, while hostile in tone, did not advocate exceptional legislation against the Jews. The term "clandestine schools," coined in the 1820s, referred only to traditional hadarim in which no secular studies were taught, not to other private Jewish schools, however mediocre. The first Jewish school for girls in Strasbourg was established in 1824, not 1844.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 113 The Shaping of Jewish Identity in Nineteenth-Century France takes its place among a growing number of books on modern European Jewry that challenge the conventional wisdom about "assimilated Jews" in the nine- teenth century. It is essential reading for all those who seek an understand- ing of the complexity of the processes of acculturation and identity forma- tion that accompanied emancipation. Paula E.
