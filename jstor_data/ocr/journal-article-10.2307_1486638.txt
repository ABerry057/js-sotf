Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1992. xi, 307 pp.</page><page sequence="2">274 BOOK REVIEWS Scholarship in the area of the history of religious ideas is often an act of cultural appropriation. Scholars tend to take the thought of persons considered to be of importance and influence. They then attempt, with greater or lesser degrees of sensitivity, to translate this thought into terms comprehensible to the contemporary academy. The process of translation from one cultural matrix to another, however, is fraught with difficulty. Roman Foxbrunner's book on the thought of the Hasidic master R. Shneur Zalman is just such an attempt. The book, based upon the author's Harvard University dissertation, begins with a review of previous scholarly literature on the subject of Hasidism. In general, he finds previous scholarship woefully inadequate in both methodology and execution. He thus joins himself to the revisionist wing of kabbalistic scholarship. He occasionally has a good word to say for G. Scholem, and, in his explanation of Lurianic thought, he is often dependent on him. However, for the most part, he condemns Scholem as well as I. Tishby and R. Schatz both in the body of the book and in a series of excurses at the end of the volume. One major issue which rouses Foxbrunner is the link several scholars have made between nascent Hasidism and Sabbatianism. He is firm in his assertion that, despite the work of Scholem and Tishby, one should not assume that there are definite links between the Sabbatian heresy and Hasidism, though he does eventually admit that "Sabbatian-like teachings are not completely absent from [R. Jacob Joseph's] Toledot" (p. 212). Foxbrunner correctly points out the methodological difficulties inherent in any attempted reconstruction of early Hasidism and decries the misuse and misinterpretation of the sources by previous researchers. While recognizing the difficulty, however, he does not proffer a satisfactory solution. His discussion of the issue of the accuracy of the Baal Shem Tov's teachings as they appear in the works of R. Jacob Joseph will serve as an example (p. 10): The works of his Boswell, Rabbi Jacob Joseph . . . contain at least four hundred statements that this disciple claims to have heard directly from his master, along with many others that he variously identifies as being either at secondhand, or "in style of my teacher," or "according to his method," or as possibly inaccurate in some way. The consistency and precision with which he distinguishes between these categories suggest that his direct quotations are the most reliable examples of what R. Israel Baal Shem Tov actually taught.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 275 However nuanced, what we are left with is Foxbrunner's faith that R. Jacob Joseph would not deceive us. Perhaps he is correct and perhaps he is not. That scholarship may be forced into an agnostic position by the nature of the evidence does not commend itself to the author here. Foxbrunner condemns the work of his predecessor in the analysis of the thought of R. Shneur Zalman, Moshe Hallamish. Beyond technical and interpretative disputes (listed at length in excursus K), the essence of his disagreement is that "[Hallamish's] general method is to select a theme that he, if not RSZ, considers to be an important rubric and examine what each book says on the subject" (p. 53). As for himself, Foxbrunner sees his task in the following way: "We are faced with a kaleidoscopic corpus that resists both facile and ingenious attempts at harmonization. Our only real alternative is to analyze that corpus as it appears" (p. 57). Ultimately, Foxbrunner will be judged by the extent to which he is able to communicate the thought of R. Shneur Zalman to a contemporary audience. To a great extent he succeeds in conveying a nuanced and sensitive reading of the writings of R. Shneur Zalman, but only because he has done something not dissimilar to that which he has condemned in Hallamish. He has chosen for himself a series of rubrics, some of which may be suggested directly in the works of R. Shneur Zalman and others of which (e.g., "Ontology," p. 63) represent an attempt at translating R. Shneur Zalman's thought into rubrics accessible to people trained in Western thought. Foxbrunner lets us understand many of the complexities and contradictions inherent in R. Shneur Zalman's thought. In his concentration on the thought, however, he has neglected to give the reader a connected historical framework, such as the one provided by Naftali Lowenthal in Communicating the Infinite: The Emergence of the Habad School (Chicago, 1990). For specialists in medieval Jewish thought or Hasidism, this may be of little consequence, since it may be assumed that they possess this framework. For others, however, less familiar with the lay of the land, this concentration on the intellectual at the expense of the material may hinder the book's usefulness as cultural appropriation in the best sense of the term.
