Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 1995. xvii, 350 pp. Clearly the history of the Jews in England needs to be rewritten, and the source material must include evidence from popular culture. While we think of England as a liberal democratic country, open and responsive to diversity, the fact is that the country's Jewish community was expelled in 1290, Jews were not readmitted until 1655, and England frequently did not have an enlightened history of toleration toward Jews. As a product of Anglo-American humanism, I was educated to believe that Jews were on the whole accepted when in 1655 Oliver Cromwell agreed, without getting it ratified by formal decree, to Manasseh Ben Israel's petition to readmit the Jews. But, as Frank Felsenstein compellingly argues in his Anti-Semitic Stereotypes: A Paradigm of Otherness in English Popular Culture, 1660-1830, "The nation that half a millennium before had been the first in medieval Europe to expel its Jews, a nation that (as far as records reveal) was also the first to promote the myth of the Wandering Jew and the obscenity of the blood libel, showed a purblind refusal to let go of its primitive superstitions with anything like the genial quiescence that many later scholars would have us suppose" (p. 1). Felsenstein carefully culls the available written evidence, including chapbooks, jestbooks, and broadside ballads-the reading material for rural households that included readers-and oral folklore, and this method works</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 177 well, particularly since he is also informed about history and canonical high culture. The book nicely complements a recent book that I reviewed on these pages: Bryan Cheyette's Constructions of "The Jew" in English Literature and Society: Racial Representations, 1875-1945 (Cambridge, 1993).1 Felsenstein's book examines 170 years of seeing the Jew as Other, as stranger, as outsider. Given that so few Jews lived in England, it is surprising at first how the Jew was demonized. As Felsenstein notes, "The Jew of the eighteenth-century imagination threatens to overturn and confound the fabric of the social order by the uneasiness that his being brings, although perhaps he unwittingly mirrors the cracks and tensions already inherent there. He is the perpetual outsider whose unsettling presence serves to define the bounds that separate the native Englishman from the alien Other" (p. 3). Much of Felsenstein's focus is not on Jews but on English cultural attitudes toward Jews. How a culture constructs outsiders, strangers, new arrivals, differences-others-tells us much about that culture; and as Cheyette and Felsenstein both show, constructions of Jews are submerged cultural and autobiographical data. What, we need ask, are the reasons for English antisemitism, often in the complete or nearly complete absence of Jews? What is it about British insularity and geography that shapes the English need to exclude difference and other while articulating (if not maintaining) the strongest beliefs in fair play and justice? Felsenstein shows how "even the challenge of the rational Enlightenment failed to eradicate the grossest of imputations by which the Jews had been depicted in an unbroken tradition from medieval times as inveterate desecrators of the sanctity of the Cross" (p. 6). He shows that the otherness of the Jews is typical of racial stereotyping; the stereotype was based necessarily on fantasy and legend, since, as I have noted, from 1290 to 1655 there were no Jews to observe. As Felsenstein writes, "Much of the antipathy that the English felt toward the Jews from the time of the readmission had its origin in popular prejudice that had flourished in the collective imagination over many centuries and had become embodied in the traditional stereotyped figure" (p. 51). Surely we can learn from Felsenstein's study how a multicultural society must examine claims for evidence about its stereotypes. We might think of the virulent antisemitism in contemporary Eastern Europe in countries and regions where Jews have been absent for half a century. The Jewish population at the time of the resettlement was made up of 1.

Most of the early settlers were, like Disraeli's forebears, Sephardic, but by 1720 the Ashkenazim outnumbered the Sephardim, and, unlike the often prosperous Sephardim, they were usually poor. By 1750 three-fourths of British Jews were Ashkenazim. The Sephardim dressed like Christians, were clean-shaven, and tried to assimilate; the Ashkenazim wore the distinctive clothes of Eastern European Jews. That the Ashkenazim were ambulatory peddlers not only reinforced the medieval prejudice that Jews would cunningly trick their Christian neighbors, but gave credence to the popular legend of the Wandering Jew. By 1677, there were 500 Jews, and fifty years later 6,000 in a population of 7 to 8 million. By 1830 there were 25,000 among 14 million. As Felsenstein notes, "in popular belief, following their readmission and particularly at a time of rampant agitation as that which greeted the Naturalization Bill of 1753, it was fairly regularly proposed that the Jews existed in such large numbers as to be on the point of overwhelming both Church and State" (pp. 45-46). In part, this stemmed from the influence of the notorious Samson Gideon (1699-1752), whose financial maneuvers both enriched himself and saved the government from financial collapse; Gideon helped create the image of the Jew as manipulative plutocrat. Not only popular culture, but figures such as Samuel Pepys and William Hogarth, contributed to this antisemitic scourge. So did frequent revivals of The Merchant of Venice, beginning in 1741 with Charles Macklin's charismatic Shylock, which turned Shylock into a metonymy for "Jew" and a synonym for "conniving Jew." But let us return to Hogarth, whose cartoon exaggerations played an important role in shaping eighteenth-century attitudes toward Jews. He exemplifies how the blood libel gave way to exaggerations about monetary dealings. Discussing plate 2 in Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress (1732), in which a wealthy Jew is decoyed by an unfaithful courtesan and her Christian lover, Felsenstein writes: "The plate's significance is not simply in its graphic depiction of the bamboozling of a fashionable Jew, but in the extraordinary cultural influence that it was to have" (p. 54). In 1757, in the second of his four election engravings, Canvassing for Votes, Hogarth created an unscrupulous peddler who began the tradition of "a long line of such figures, usually caricatured and often engaged in similar forms of trickery, who are represented in prints from this time through to at least the mid-nineteenth century" (pp. 56-57). The Jewish peddler was a trickster, a caricature used by Thomas Rowlandson in his 1785 engraving Too Many for</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 179 a Jew. The Rowlandson figure became the prototype for the Wandering Jew, a legend depending on the lore that the dispersion of the Jews was the result of divine censure, and hence the Jew must wander, like Cain, over the face of the earth. Even those who welcomed Jews did so in the hope of converting them by stressing the parallels between Jewish and Christian beliefs. As Felsenstein notes, philosemitism was held by those "who considered that to embrace the Jews within the bosom of the nation was an indispensable first step toward encouraging the return of the Messiah and the fulfillment of the Christian apocalypse" (p. 11). Of course this visionary teleology denied the identity of Jews as Jews. Amusingly, like the Irish-as Joyce shows in Ulysses-the English believed they were descendants of the ten lost tribes. If Albion was Jerusalem, could the Messiah be that far off? The centerpiece of Felsenstein's study, and the subject of chapter 8, the second-to-the-last chapter, is his discussion of the 1753 Jewish Naturalization Act, which influenced popular passions disproportionate to the bill's importance. The bill sought to offer foreign-born Jews who could prove that they resided in Great Britain or Ireland the opportunity, by private petition to Parliament, to be naturalized without receiving any Anglican sacrament. Only the wealthy could afford this process. Following the bill's passage, Felsenstein writes, "the mob frenzy that it aroused provides as close an approximation as we are likely to find in eighteenth-century England to the kind of popular hysteria that in pre-expulsion days may have sparked a pogrom" (p. 190). But the language of the bill's opponents in Parliament shows a kinship with the mob. Both were based on fear as much as rage, and both depended on the Jew as bogeyman, responsible for whatever real and imagined social ills existed at the time. The bill was repealed in the next parliamentary session. Gradually, after 1753, England became more tolerant. While the roots can be found in John Locke's 1689 Letter Concerning Toleration, William Hazlitt's essay "The Emancipation of the Jews" (1831) argued that the social alienation of Jews was a result of how England treated them. When the Jews took on more varied roles, and more English people were exposed to them, prejudice began to ebb. In 1830 Robert Grant introduced a bill to abolish civil disabilities laws for Jews. William Cobbett was a prominent antisemitic voice among popular writers opposing the 1830 bill, and it was defeated. But the bill began a process, as Felsenstein explains in his last chapter, "Toward Emancipation," culminating in the Jews' full emancipation in 1858.</page><page sequence="5">180 BOOK REVIEWS In his epilogue, Felsenstein concludes: Although the progressive secularization of English society during the eighteenth century helped to modify and attenuate many malicious beliefs concerning Jews, it did not eradicate but merely altered the nature of anti-Semitism for the age that followed. ... For the Englishman of 1830, the compunction to acknowledge a refracted image of his own biases and shortcomings in the scapegoat of the Other and then to forgive remained little more than primitive. ... Although the better part of two centuries had elapsed since their readmission, a cloud of fundamental ignorance concerning the true nature of their customs, habits, and beliefs still shrouded the average Englishman's perception of th(lJpw57, 259) And antisemitism, as Cheyette shows us, persisted through 1830 and be- yond. Dickens's Fagin hardly helped. Disraeli was the object of virulent antisemitism, and he was a convert. We know, too, that even in the 1930s certain segments of British society flirted with Nazism. It is too bad that Felsenstein did not take his story beyond 1830, even if only an overview to include Disraeli. In his romance Alroy (1833), and later in Lord George Bentinck (1850), Disraeli argued that the Jews were not only especially gifted but the most aristocratic of races, and that the Jewish race was the source of all that was spiritual in European civilization, most notably Christianity. In Alroy, wasn't Disraeli intervening in the debate about Jews by showing their heroism and magnitude? Felsenstein does not sufficiently differentiate between religious anti-Judaism and racial antisemitism of the kind that led to the Holocaust; he makes the case that the differences between religious and racial stereotyping become a distinction without a difference. But England did not have pogroms. With its thoroughly sustained argument and fine balance between the specific and conceptual, this book is a pleasure to read, notwithstanding that the opening chapter, "Stereotypes," has some ideological baggage and jargon. The fine, carefully chosen illustrations add a great deal to this splendid study; indeed it is the visual evidence that is often most compelling. Informed, aware of the dialogue between popular and high culture, and based on exhaustive research, Felsenstein's book is cultural studies at its best.
