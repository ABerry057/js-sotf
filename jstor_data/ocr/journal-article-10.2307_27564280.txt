Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. pp. 344 DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000426 This book represents an important contribution to the study of the relation ship between Jewish religion and modernity, not only in France but in Europe generally. Employing an interdisciplinary methodology that mixes history, anthro pology, and rabbinical texts, Jay Berkovitz traces the subtle but important trans formation of Jewish sensibilities in France before the French Revolution of 1789 and the subsequent emancipation of French Jewry in 1791. In doing so, his study extends the reach of modernity backward, creating more historical 1.

He argues that emancipation was not the sole turning point on the French Jewish path to modernity. Rather, emancipation was a step?albeit a crucial one? in a process that had begun much earlier and continued for decades afterward. His approach also questions the general scholarly view that French Jews met emanci pation by opting for either complete religious laxity or retreating into a reactionary traditionalism. The book begins with three chapters on leadership and social control in the Jewish communities of the ancien r?gime. Berkovitz's careful reading of the French responsa literature and communal laws reveals the nature and depth of the challenges to Jewish authority. These sources reveal communal conflicts over issues such as ritual change, conspicuous consumption, and social contact between the sexes. Such friction, Berkovitz holds, resulted from class and generational issues that spilled over into Jewish religious life. These broader tensions sowed the seeds for later developments after the Revolution, when the traditional French com munal structure was reorganized. At that point, the obligations of citizenship raised new expectations, both for the place of Judaism in the lives of Jewish laypeople and for the role that French rabbis were to play in modem Jewish life. Berkovitz masterfully contexrualizes these struggles within their specific cultural and geographic milieus, using rabbinical rulings to illuminate contrasting regional practices and the way they were melded into a "modem" conception. The last six chapters revisit subjects that will be familiar to historians of French Jewry, most notably, the questions raised by French citizenship, the struggle to balance Jewish continuity with French patriotism, and the non-Jewish opinions of French Jews. They also engage a variety of issues that have received less scholarly attention, especially the impact of Wissenschaft on Jewish scholarship and the nature of Jewish religious reform in France. Notably, Berkovitz devotes an entire chapter to the debate over Judaism during the Bourbon Restoration (1815-30). The parallels and contrasts between radical French assimilationists, such as the politician Arthur Beugnot, and radical Jewish reformers, such as Olry Terquem, illustrate the potential threats that shaped Jewish communal affairs during this period. Both men charged that French Jews remained too separate from French society. Beugnot blamed rabbis and traditional Judaism, advocating government-sponsored measures to refine Jewish religious rituals and thereby stimulate Jewish integration. Terquem blamed the leaders of the Jewish Consistory?the administrative structure created by Napo leon to oversee French Jewish communal life with an eye toward assimilating French Jews?whom he claimed had promoted Jewish estrangement through the maintenance of outdated religious practices and opinions. Jewish leaders responded by aligning French Judaism with French civic life, establishing a modern rabbinical school whose graduates would promote the fusion between French culture and Jewish religious life. Berkovitz outlines these schools of thought in great detail, giving Terquem in particular a closer reading than previous historical works. Ultimately, Berkovitz argues, despite these challenges, religious traditional ism remained a more powerful force among nineteenth-century French Jewry than historians have generally believed. Even after many French Jews had gone down 205</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the path of acculturation and ceased to observe Judaism in a strict manner, tra ditional Jewish ritual retained considerable social and cultural (as well as spiritual) significance, especially for Jews in Alsace and Lorraine who?literally and figura tively?stood further apart from the larger centers of acculturation. In this light, the Consistory structure that Napoleon had established to facilitate the assimilation of French Jews actually perpetuated and reinforced traditional Jewish communal structures. Because the consistories were state-sanctioned (and after 1831, state funded) institutions, they sought to maintain a united front in which Judaism remained consistent with the competing demands of citizenship and French Jewish continuity. Yet this facade of unity belied the broader controversy gener ated within French Jewry as it faced modem life. By paying attention to ritual decisions and practices?in short, what French Jews actually did?Berkovitz discovers layers of internal Jewish dissent over the prospect of modernity that until now lay hidden beneath assumptions of uniformity or laxity.
