<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Etan Levine. The Aramaic Version of the Bible: Contents and Context. Beiheft zur Zeitschrift fi:r die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 174. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988. xiv, 258 pp. Etan Levine's volume is essentially a sort of descriptive biography of the Targum per se, presenting a literary composite portrait of the ancient Jewish Aramaic versions of the Bible. Thus the title of the work is somewhat mis- leading, as it gives the impression of the existence of a single uniform Targum for the entire Hebrew Bible. That this is far from the truth is recog- nized by the author himself, who says in the opening paragraph of the pref- ace (p. vii), "as varied a genre of writings as the Aramaic targum." He goes on to describe the various Targums in chapter 4, "The Extant Targums" (pp. 20-30), in which he illustrates the peculiar character and complexities of certain Targums. Here Levine repeatedly suggests that no reliable data exist to identify the authors and compilers of the various Targums, nor to determine for what specific purposes they created these Aramaic versions or how the literary transmission was achieved. In view of this problem, would it not have been wiser to have pluralized the word "version" in the title in order to reflect the complexity of the situation, not to mention the real inten- tion of the work-to present a composite picture of an Aramaic Bible version based on the various characteristic features as manifest in the differ- ent Targums as currently extant. The book is divided into a total of twenty-nine chapters, with the first five comprising "introductory essays" on general themes (chap. 2, "The Language Barrier"; chap. 3, "Tradition and Translation"; chap. 5, "The Aramaic Version as Textual Witness"; and chap. 6, "General Characteris- 211</page><page sequence="2">212 BOOK REVIEWS tics of Targum"). The main section presents an overall description of subject contents as found in the various Targums. These range from "Aspects of Monotheism" (chap. 1), "The Name of God" (chap. 2), "The Angelic, the Demonic, the Occult" (chap. 3), "On Divine Justice" (chap. 5), "Free Will and the Evil Urge" (chap. 6), "Imputed Merit and Imputed Guilt" (chap. 8), "The Jerusalem Temple" (chap. 10), "Repentance and Prayer" (chap. 11), "On Prayer" (chap. 12), "On Torah" (chap. 13), to "Contradictions of Pharisaic-Rabbinic Law" (chap. 16), "History and Historiography" (chap. 17), "The Theology of the Exile" (chap. 18), "Anti-Christian Polemic" (chap. 20), "Anti-Moslem Polemic" (chap. 21), "The Messiah" (chap. 22), and "The Resurrection and the Afterlife" (chap. 23). Examples are cited at random from the extant Targums, sometimes giving the impression that a particular subject, approached in a particular manner in a particular Tar- gum, may be representative of other extant Targums as well. Thus, for instance, the statement "according to the theology of the Targum" (p. 82) is followed by a passage in Num. 35:26 occurring in the Palestinian Targums only. A comment on its absence in Targum Onqelos would have been appro- priate at this point, as well as one on the "unofficial" status of the Pales- tinian Targums, which consequently do not reflect the accepted rabbinic exegesis of this verse. By the same token, when Levine claims that various aspects of the significance of Torah "pervade all of the targums" (p. 137) he proceeds to five examples, all of which occur in the Palestinian Targums exclusively. The overall objection that may be forwarded involves a lack of relationship between the criteria as set forward in the introductory chapter, "The Extant Targums," where the distinctive Targums in existence are defined according to their peculiar features and limits, and the main body of the work described in the remaining twenty-three chapters. Aside from this underlying deficiency, the work is very organized and presents in a single volume a highly detailed and well-documented outline of the theology inherent in the various Aramaic versions of biblical texts. As to some isolated problems, the following may be worth noting. Con- cerning the use of the Targum in contemporary society, Levine remarks: "The public reading of targum has been retained to this day by isolated Jewish communities where Arabic has replaced Aramaic as the vernacular, thus necessitating a further targum (Arab. tafsir)" (p. 10, n.10). What about some of the Yemenite Jewish communities in Israel today that still recite Targum Onqelos in their weekly Sabbath services? Levine's remark that "the biblical Hebrews are given the anachronistic</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 213 designation 'Jews,' " (p. 33) should be documented by Targum Onqelos' use of the designation "Jews" for the biblical Hebrews in Exod. 1:15, 19 in the footnote (n. 8). In his chapter "On Divine Justice" (p. 81), Levine cites three examples (Isa. 24:23, Jer. 14:4, Zeph. 3:8) to illustrate that God's anger is not misdirected or is not a function of arbitrary caprice. In the latter two examples "the earth" in the Hebrew text is expanded in the Targum to read "the inhabitants of the earth" and "the wicked of the earth." This is nothing more than a literary device to treat a metonymy in the original text. In the case of the dispute between Cain and Abel as spelled out in the Palestinian Targums, Levine belabors the point by citing the entire elaborate passage in Neofiti after having done so for Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (pp. 89-90). Since they are virtually identical, a footnote documenting it would have sufficed. In citing Ps. Jon. as a source for a targumic rendering involving phylac- teries (p. 149, n. 1) in Deut. 6:8, 11:18, why not also list the "official" Tar- gum Onqelos instead, which has this translation as well? Levine erroneously attributes a literal translation to Targum Onqelos on Lev. 19:32 (p. 165) when, in fact, that Aramaic version parallels exactly the oral tradition as contained in Sifra ad loc., and B. Qiddushin 32a. Likewise, Levine's remark (pp. 165-166) that Targum Onqelos renders Deut. 32:18 "in the narrower sense" in contrast to rabbinic interpretation is not true at all. In fact, the translation in Targum Onqelos digresses from the Hebrew text considerably by interpreting it to refer to marriages between Israelites and slaves. Levine's documentation of the Job Targum 15:19, 38:13, as a source for the idea that 'God has designated the land of Israel only for the people of Israel" (p. 171) is contrary to fact. No such translation exists there. As far as form is concerned, OB, TJ, and TO have no equivalencies in the Abbreviations (pp. xiii-xiv). If TJ refers to Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, it is inconsistent with the designation PsJ given in the Abbreviations, whereas if it means Palestinian Targum as per the Abbreviations, then a documenta- tion is missing. This leaves us with typos, of which there are quite a few, some quite serious: Page 9 "apparant" for "apparent" 14, n. 2 page numbers for article are missing. 17 "he" for "the"</page><page sequence="4">214 BOOK REVIEWS 21 "had" for "has" 26 "ince" for "since" 26 "soterica" for "esoterica" 27 "onomastic" for "onomastica" 29 "consonental" for "consonantal" 32 "tiel" for "piel" 33 "Can's" for "Cain's" 35 "ountain" for "mountain" 45 "Isreal" for "Israel" 61, n. 19 "ppreserves" for "preserves" 62 "animous" for "animus" 64 "Messian" for "Messiah" 66 "CE," for "C.E.," 66 "Onquelos" for "Onqelos" 70 "Palestinine" for "Palestine" 70 "to Pentateuch" for "to the Pentateuch" 89 "eludicate" for "elucidate" 117, n. 4 "Dr." for "Dt." 126, n. 14 "amman's" for "Hamman's" 133 "T Dt." for "TO Dt." 160 "Nu." for "Lev." 166 "Jewish" for "Jacob" 168 "reswi 'ays"' for "reli-'aya' " 184 "Pt" for "PT" The volume closes with selected bibliography, a source index, and a sub- ject index. The above criticism does not in the least detract from the value of this work. Levine has produced a practical work for biblical studies, and those interested in Targum are especially indebted to him.
