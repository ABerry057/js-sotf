Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987. 380 pp. Fifty years after Kristallnacht the image of Jewish martyrdom remains a significant issue for historians and theologians of Judaism. It has been con- sidered axiomatic that both the theological and historical origins of this con- cept are to be traced to the violent upheavals of the First Crusade in 1096. The parallels are seductive: Europe united under the banner of the cross; religious zealotry rampant; Jews regarded as aliens, and thus as a fore- shadowing of the foreign enemy; Germany the locale of most of the destroyed communities. A narrative framework can be established with per- fect symmetry. Historians of medieval Jewry who make no explicit reference to the Shoah consider the First Crusade as a turning point in the history of German Jewry.' Robert Chazan's European Jewry and the First Crusade challenges this symmetry. His basic purpose is to demonstrate that Jews lived in a "shared environment with the Christian community" (p. 3). This proposition estab- lishes a framework for the interpretation of the Jewish documents from the period of the First Crusade in the context of the European economic and cultural milieu.2 By adopting a viewpoint which places Jews as a part of European culture rather than apart from that world, Chazan is able to break up the intertwining of history and theology which has tended to homogenize 1.

It was precisely this formulation that led B.

Chazan's argument is developed in a logical sequence. First, what was the milieu of the First Crusade? Second, what sort of documents constitute the Jewish response to this world? Third, how does the concept of martyr- dom as it appears in these documents compare to subsequent Jewish formu- lations? Finally, how did the experience of the First Crusade affect both Jews and Christians in later periods? The eleventh and twelfth centuries were a period of growth and expan- sion in the European economy. Jews were a part of the development of trade and cities. There was a pervasive atmosphere of danger and violence for all who engaged in these new ventures. The church, in the person of the bishop, attempted to mediate this violence and establish peace and order. It is pre- cisely this balance which, Chazan argues, was disturbed by the First Crusade (pp. 75-79). Religious zeal as expressed by the mobs was an over- simplification and radicalization of the balance between toleration and regu- lation which had characterized ecclesiastical teaching since the period of the church fathers. In the Hebrew Chronicles, which reflect the activities of the Jewish com- munities, Chazan establishes patterns of Jewish response. He argues, against Ivan Marcus, that these Chronicles do not reveal a "paradigm shift." Rather, there were identifiable patterns of behavior and thought which are particularly striking to the extent that they represent departures from prior modes of Jewish behavior and thought" (p. 49).3 Jews reacted by (1) dealing directly with the crusaders; (2)turning to fellow townsmen for aid: (3) addressing authorities either imperial or ecclesiastical for intervention; (4) physical self-defense; (5) apostasy; or (6) martyrdom. It is martyrdom which appears to be the most original response of the Jewish communities. Searching back into the rabbinic sources, Chazan determines that the Jewish martyrdoms during the Crusades cannot be directly connected to earlier models. Rather, they were a radical reinterpretation of the tradition that comported with the religious zeal of the cultural environment. Just as Chris- tians went on the Crusades to suffer and sacrifice themselves for Christ, 3. Cf. Ivan G. Marcus, "From Politics to Martyrdom: Shifting Paradigms in the Hebrew Narratives of the 1096 Crusading Riots," Prooftexts 2 (1982): 40:52. Chazan presents the details of his argument with Marcus on p. 308, n. 21. What is most impressive is that both authors argue that the hermeneutical framework for discussing the Chronicles should be literary pat- terns rather than empirical verification.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 73 Jews resumed the Temple sacrifice in a radical and personal reinterpreta- tion. The binding of Isaac received a new context as a model for activism. By rejecting the Christian typology of the binding of Isaac, Jews became the true sacrifice, as they hoped their martyrdom would evoke divine interven- tion on their behalf. The Crusade Chronicles reveal an imaginative re- interpretation of older codes of religious behavior and symbol systems. Chazan articulates their purpose as a Jewish countercrusade against the Christians (pp. 132-133). The impulse toward active martyrdom was modified by the time of the Second Crusade. Instead, the events of 1096 were absorbed into a frame- work of memorialization. Chazan rejects the Bible and Midrashim as appro- priate literary antecedents for the Chronicles. He prefers to look outside the Jewish community to the Latin Chronicles of the Crusades and the vernacu- lar Chansons de Geste, which were produced out of the intense spiritual exhilaration characteristic of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. More concretely, Chazan utilizes the introduction to Fulcher of Chartres' Gesta Francorum to suggest a title for the Hebrew reports. If the Gesta Francorum were composed to relate "the illustrious deeds of the Franks" and "God's miracles which occurred among them," then the Hebrew Chronicles might be titled "The Deeds of the Communities of Ashkenaz and the Way in which they Sanctified the Unique Divine Name" (p. 151). It is this cross-cultural understanding which leads Chazan to the conclusion that the Hebrew Chronicles belong to the literary genre of the "epic of defeat," wherein a small force is outnumbered and overwhelmed by its cultural in- feriors but manages to survive. The epic of defeat holds out the promise of an ultimate victory that will transcend the immediate crisis. For those who lived through the Crusades, the Chronicles served to memorialize their hav- ing passed a test whose reward would be divine intervention-a message of consolation and hope. Chazan claims this was true for both Christian and Jewish Chronicles. Subsequent Crusades did not evoke radical literary exhortations from the Jewish communities. Stronger temporal or ecclesiastical institutions pre- vented recurrences of the chaotic zeal of the First Crusade. Chazan argues 4. There has been a tendency among medievalists, in their evaluations of intellectual developments during the twelfth century, to emphasize France over Germany. An excellent corrective perspective may be found in John van Engen, "Benedictine Monasticism in the Years 1050-1150," Speculum 61 (1986): 264-304.</page><page sequence="4">74 BOOK REVIEWS that limitations on Jewish status derived from economic difficulties rather than theological shifts. Although there is a danger in blurring the lines between economic and theological motivation with respect to medieval sources, Chazan's analysis of Otto of Freising's Chronicle and Bernard of Clairvaux's letters is most convincing. Chazan concludes that 1096 was not a turning point in the history of medieval Jewry. There was no demographic or economic shift. Communi- ties in Germany returned to normal with imperial and ecclesiastical support. Intellectual growth continued in Germany even as it flourished in France.4 The First Crusade should not, therefore, be interpreted as an explanation for the later decline of European Jewries. European Jewry and the First Crusade is a challenging book. It should change the forms of discourse about the Hebrew Chronicles from argument about empirical verification to the forum of intellectual history. By empha- sizing the contextuality of medieval documents about martyrdom, Chazan forces modern historians and theologians to reexamine their comfortable assumptions about continuity and discontinuity in Jewish history.
