<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aviezer Ravitzky. History and Faith: Studies in Jewish Philosophy. Amster- dam: J. C. Gieben, 1996. ix, 325 pp. This book is a collection of nine essays by one of today's leading scholars of Jewish philosophy. Previously published between 1981 and 1990 (though the citations identifying where they first appeared are listed somewhat awkwardly and unclearly at the end of the volume), the essays have been revised for this volume. The focus of the collection is almost exclusively on issues in medieval Jewish philosophy, the field which has been Ravitzky's</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 141 primary specialty, though some deal with rabbinic and modem material as well. The essays are divided into two groups. The first deals with questions of philosophy and history. As Ravitzky tells us in his preface, these essays are concerned with philosophical reflections on Jewish history-in particular, the issue of messianism and whether it seeks to be continuous with history or to transcend it. This group begins with an essay effectively introducing the entire volume in which Ravitzky discusses his views on the nature and scope of the field of medieval Jewish philosophy. It is followed by chapters on issues related to messianism: the concept of peace in Judaism, the political thought of Isaac Abravanel and Rabbi Nissim of Gerona, and Maimonides' views on the messianic age. Here, in effect, we see the "Israeli" dimension of Ravitzky's scholarship. Ravitzky, like many Israeli scholars, has been particularly interested in utopianism, messianism, and related themes, such as the philosophy of Jewish history and political theory. The reason for this interest is obvious in that these are issues with which Israelis have had to struggle. That struggle has been particularly meaningful for Ravitzky, whose activities with the political Left in Israel are well known. The second group is concerned with philosophy and faith, examining a variety of issues related to the age-old dilemma of reason and its relationship to revealed religion. The first essay in this section deals with a controversy in fifteenth-century Crete between proponents of Kabbalah and of philosophy. The next essay deals with what Ravitzky calls the anthropological theory of miracles in medieval Jewish philosophy, which posits that miracles occur because of special properties in the soul of the prophet. This is followed by an analysis of Samuel ibn Tibbon's thought in which Ravitzky demonstrates that ibn Tibbon was the first interpreter of Maimonides to develop a sophisticated method for interpreting the Guide of the Perplexed in an esoteric manner. The same theme is pursued in a subsequent essay in which Ravitzky gives a lengthy history of how the esoteric reading of Maimonides developed from medieval through modem times. Finally, the last essay deals with the lost Arabic version of Aristotle's Parva Naturalia and its influence on medieval Jewish thought. It is evident from this collection why Ravitzky has become a scholar of such stature. His scholarship is impressive on a number of levels. First, he has a knack for honing in on important and interesting issues previously unexplored by others. His work on ibn Tibbon, not to mention his work on other thirteenth-century figures not represented here, has brought attention to</page><page sequence="3">142 BOOK REVIEWS a school of philosophical exegesis that despite its importance has aroused little scholarly interest. His essays also demonstrate remarkable breadth of erudition not just in medieval Jewish philosophy, but also in related disciplines, such as Kabbalah (and this volume does not even touch on his contributions in modem Jewish thought, which in recent years have been substantial). But what is perhaps most impressive is Ravitzky's capacity for insight. This talent is evident on any number of points too numerous to list. It is also evident in his ability to come up with broad and creative conceptual frameworks to organize and analyze his material. His essay on peace, for instance, creates a conceptual structure for analyzing in a highly effective manner a diverse body of material consisting of rabbinic and medieval sources. He does the same in his analysis of the various esoteric approaches toward Maimonides' philosophy. Perhaps a limitation in Ravitzky's work is that it is very much in the style of the scholarship that has dominated the study of Jewish philosophy since the last century. This approach is devoted to organizing and systematizing the philosophical ideas found in a wide variety of medieval sources that touch on philosophical problems, and tracing the development of these ideas from one thinker to the next. While this approach is certainly valuable, one wonders whether it is not time to entertain the use of other methods alongside it. However, if Ravitzky has not experimented with new methodologies, neither have his colleagues in the same field. Moreover, the history of ideas approach is one that will always have an important place in the study of medieval Jewish philosophy. Ravitzky's work should certainly be regarded as one of its finest exemplars. Robert Eisen George Washington University Washington, D.C.</page></plain_text>
