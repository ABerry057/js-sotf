<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Sperber. Magic and Folklore in Rabbinic Literature. Bar Han Studies in Near Eastern Languages and Culture. Ramat-Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 1994. 256 pp. This collection of essays is a significant contribution to the understanding of some terms and motifs in rabbinic literature. The author explains these terms by utilizing comparable phenomena in other cultures. These cultural borrowings and transformations of concepts derive from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Persian loci, as is to be expected, and additionally from the more distant areas of the Far East, such as china. Daniel Sperber's perspective in investigating virtually incomprehensible expressions in rabbinic sources is philogical, historical, and folkloric. In these multiple approaches the author is able to draw upon his extensive knowledge of textual and archaeological sources, which is evident from his other works in the field of applies philology.' The first part of Magic and Folklore addresses issues of folklore, magic, historical allusion, and the dating of midrashic passages, while the second part of the book has a lengthy analysis of Yerushalmi, Berakhot, chapter 1. The book contains indices, including a very valuable index of terms. In many cases the author provides the reader of rabbinic texts with new and meaningful definitions of truly misunderstood terms. For example, the meaning of nwtv in connection with stories about the origin of the festival of Hanukkah, as found in Megillat Ta'anit and Pesiqta Rabbati, in analyzed and redefined. The Hebrew tv,'T~r (plural) had been translated as "rods of iron which they [the Maccabees] grooved out and then kindled wicks in the oil which they poured into the grooves."2 Sperber postulates that these "rods" 1.

He supports his position by citing Greek and talmudic sources and by a quotation from the Dead Sea Scrolls. In another approach to a difficult textual passage concerning the instrument which was used in the torture of Manasseh, Sperber traces a Persian word that appears in Palestinian rabbinic texts and immediately addresses the question of why such a loan-word appears in such an unlikely context. The partial answer that he provides is that the text (Midrash ha-Gadol on Genesis) is a Babylonian redaction of a Palestinian text. Sperber's findings are in accord with the earlier ideas of Wilhelm Bacher and others about the idol-like animal image into which Manasseh was place. However, Sperber supplies additional textual and cultural evidence for his readings. Persian sources are again considered in the story of R. Yohanan in Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. One of the characteristics of the rabbi was that he had drooping eyelids that needed to be lifted up; Sperber mainly relies upon Theodor Noeldeke's contention that the raising of the eyelids relates to the Sassanian tale of a general named Wahriz. As reported by Tabari, Wahriz could only shoot his arrows when his drooping eyelids were lifted. This Persian-Sassanian motif was transferred to a new, rabbinic context and used to describe R. Yohanan, who was able to kill with his gaze only when his eyelids were raised. Another interesting example of an "alien" motif in rabbinic literature is the derivation from Chinese sources. Sperber contends that some passages in Palestinian rabbinic texts referring to "stone that shine by night" owe their origin to a Chinese work of the fifth century C.E. The critical question in all comparative studies is, what is the methodology upon which the comparisons are made? Sperber inuitively connects certain motifs and rejects others; he exhaustively searches different types of sources sharing a common theme. On the other hand, Sperber calls special attention to the danger of emendations of texts relying upon presumed scribal errors; e.g., emending trril (which he views as a transcription of galeotae, as found in Cicero, De divinatione 1.39) to wlut,. He furthermore objects to emending tl~nn (habarin = Magi, as in J. Neusner, A History of the Jews in Babylonia, vol. 2 [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1966], p. 149) to an'1an. According to Sperber, a major reason for the appearance of incomprehen- sible terms in rabbinic literature is that some words were transcribed back and forth from one language to another. Such words include Hebrew words that were transcribed into Greek and thereafter transcribed back into Hebrew, as demonstrated in many magical texts. The book contains a few minor errors, mainly when secondary literature</page><page sequence="3">394 BOOK REVIEWS is cited (e.g., the List of Abbreviations should read: Blau, Das Altjiidische Zauberwesen. . ., not "Blum;" p. 128, nn. 4 and 5 should read: Krauss, Griechen, not "Griecher;" p. 13, n. 1 should read: "the reference there is to Vl'u vS," not "the reference there is to 1""n = Midrash Rabba"). These minor problems do not in any way diminish the quality of the book, and the scholarly reader is still able to find the references without difficulty. However, the rationale for the inclusion of the second part of the book, a translation and explanation of Yerushalmi, Berakhot, chapter 1, was not clear to this reader. Said passage is primarily outside the realm of "folklore and magic."It was include, in the words of the author, "to give the reader a greater understanding of the nature of Rabbinic literature" (p. 175). Sperber is a master of the sources and secondary literature in diverse languages, and he is a creative thinker who skillfully connects elements from non-Jewish contexts to rabbinic literature. This book by Sperber is essential in the reference section of any rabbinic library and will be of benefit to scholars interested in the literature of late antiquity.
