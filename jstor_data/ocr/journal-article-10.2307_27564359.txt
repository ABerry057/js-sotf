Rabbinic Stories: History or Literature? In recent decades, talmudic studies, along with other disciplines devoted to the study of texts, have experienced numerous paradigm shifts regarding both methods and goals. The naive presupposition that a text provides reliable infor mation about historically situated characters, whether those described in the text or those who authored the text, has been vigorously challenged on many counts and from many angles. Responses to the challenge have ranged from sophisticated attempts to recover hermeneutical stability, whether rooted in authorial intention, in textually grounded meaning, or in some form of dialogue between the reader and the author or text, to the panoply of deconstructive approaches and other forms of postmodern recontextualization. Several of these viewpoints are reflected in the new approaches to reading Mishnah surveyed in this symposium. The new approaches presented here, each in its own way, have focused close attention on subtleties of language and nuance in talmudic texts that the predominantly philological-historical scholarship in the field of Talmud has generally ignored. These current scholars vary widely regarding goals and methods, as well as the specific features of the text on which they focus. However, despite the rather broad variety of interpretive meth odologies employed by these scholars, there is significant overlap among them, especially regarding their close attention to issues of language, structure, and style. Hence, I believe that, taken together, we may see the work of these scho lars as reflecting a significant trend in contemporary Mishnah scholarship. Moshe Simon-Shoshan's dissertation, "Halakhah lema'aseh: Narrative and Legal Discourse in the Mishnah,"1 seeks to understand the nature and purpose of the Mishnah's deployment of various narrative forms and their relationship to the Mishnah's predominantly legal content. He opens his discussion by noting the shift in recent scholarship, led by Yonah Fraenkel and Jacob Neusner, in the approach to reading rabbinic stories. Rather than reading them as "historical artifacts" revealing historical or biographical knowledge, 1. Moshe Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh: Narrative and Legal Discourse in the Mishnah" (PhD diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2005). 263</page><page sequence="2">Avraham Walfish contemporary scholars regard them as "rhetorical and literary texts" expressing rabbinic ideology.2 While this shift in scholarly approach is not quite as clear-cut as Simon-Shoshan makes it appear,3 he legitimately links himself to a distinguished line of contemporary scholars whose attention is firmly focused on the meaning and purpose of the stories rather than on the historical events that they purport to describe. Despite the fact that halakhic stories far outnumber aggadic stories in talmu dic literature, scholarship regarding rabbinic stories has focused nearly exclusively on aggadic narratives, whose literary features have enabled Fraenkel and his suc cessors to apply to them tools developed in other fields of literary study. Simon Shoshan objects to this "privileging" of "literary" over "nonliterary" texts, both conceptually and practically. From the conceptual standpoint, Fraenkel's division between literary and nonliterary texts draws on the close-reading tradition of the New Criticism,4 whereas Simon-Shoshan aligns himself with literary scholars such as Jonathan Culler and Terry Eagleton who have questioned the value of classifying texts as literary or nonliterary. Moreover, following David Stern, Simon-Shoshan questions whether rabbinic texts can be neatly and unequivocally characterized as either halakhic or aggadic, arguing that supposedly "literary" aggadic and supposedly "nonliterary" halakhic stories share many important features and that halakhic and aggadic elements are often interwoven in rabbinic stories.5 Simon-Shoshan claims that the literary and ahistorical character attributed by Fraenkel and his followers to rabbinic narrative is skewed by a circular reason ing process, as their discussion is based on stories preselected in accordance with their own literary criteria. Because the majority of rabbinic narratives are "decid edly halakhic and non-literary in nature,"6 they demand a different balance 2. Simon-Shoshan, 'Halakhah lema'aseh," 1. 3. Some contemporary historians continue to mine rabbinical stories for historical information, and others have suggested that, even after taking full account of the literary qualities and goals of rab binic stories, a reliable kernel of historical information often remains. Recent scholars who have sur veyed the approaches and the literature include J. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 3-15; I. Gafhi, '"Erez yisra'el bitkufat hamishnah vehatalmud, heker shenot dor?heseigim utehiyot," Kathedra 100 (2001): 215-26; A. Goshen-Gottstein, The Sinner and the Amnesiac (Stanford, CA: Stanford Univer sity Press, 2000), 1-20; and H. Fox, "Biography, Stories, Tall Tales: Fishing for Gullibility," Jewish Studies 41 (2002): 105-41. 4. See R. Wellek and A. Warren, Theory of Literature (London: Penguin, 1949), 20-28. In con temporary literary theory, often the debate regarding what Simon-Shoshan terms the "privileging" of "literary" texts is formulated in terms of the value of what has come to be called the "literary canon." For a defense of the concept of a literary canon, see C. Altieri, Canons and Consequences (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1990), esp. 33-^17. 5. While I share Simon-Shoshan's discomfort with overly rigid divisions between literary and nonliterary and between halakhic and aggadic, I believe that he goes too far in the opposite direction and risks blurring distinctions that are often useful and instructive. Specifically, I would argue that, although "nonliterary" texts, including halakhic texts such as the Mishnah, may display many literary features (this has been a central preoccupation in my own work, reviewed in this symposium), and although many rabbinic texts may straddle the boundary between halakhic and aggadic, there are none theless important differences in the ways in which different kinds of texts deploy these features. 6. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 4. 264</page><page sequence="3">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative between the "literary/rhetorical" and the "historical," inasmuch as these stories are designed to demonstrate that "a given practice is no longer presented as a theory or an ideal but as an inevitable fact."7 Hence, these stories, unlike aggadic stories, make a strong claim to record actual historical events. While it remains undeniably true that the contemporary historian will employ different criteria than did the rab binic narrators in determining "what really happened," the strong bifurcation of the historical and the literary suggested by much contemporary scholarship will need to give way to "a broader and more nuanced definition of the terms 'litera ture' and 'literary.'"8 II. Different Forms of Narrativity in Mishnah Simon-Shoshan's opposition to bifurcating rabbinic narrative into literary aggadic and nonliterary halakhic narratives leads him, in the first half of his dis sertation (Chap. 2-3), to claim that many texts, including those not normally understood to be narrative texts, may be seen as possessing different degrees of "narrativity." Defining the term "narrative" as a text that represents two or more interrelated and concrete one-time events, Simon-Shoshan identifies two charac teristic features of such texts: "dynamism," in the transition between the two events, and "specificity," namely, the claim that the events referred to happened? whether in reality or in fiction?at a particular time and place, as opposed to "non specific" texts that describe a repeatable pattern of events. Simon-Shoshan argues that these qualities pertain to a greater or lesser extent to many texts, regardless of whether they correspond to the definition of a "story." Most Mishnah pericopes are "irrealis," that is, nonconcrete, insofar as "they refer to potential or hypothetical situations rather than real events."9 Nevertheless, they possess differing degrees of "narrativity," depending on their respective degrees of "dynamism" and "specificity." Several factors may influence the degree of "narrativity" of a mishnaic for mulation. Thus, the least "narrative" statements in the Mishnah would be general statements of a "stative" nature, such as "[t]he primary labors [forbidden on Shabbat] are 40 minus 1" (M Shabbat 1:1). However, the most common halakhic statements utilize active verbs, usually in the kotel form, plural (i.e., less specific) or singular (more specific); thus, most halakhic statements in the Mishnah possess a degree of dynamism. Moreover, the Mishnah tends to prefer concrete rather than abstract formulations; totally non-narrative statements in the Mishnah are rare, and most Mishnaic statements possess one degree or another of "concreteness," 7. M. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhic Mimesis: Rhetorical and Redactional Strategies in Tannaitic Narrative," Dine Israel 24 (2007): 119*. 8. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 7. 9. Ibid., 30. Elsewhere (25), Simon-Shoshan follows Suzanne Fleischman, Tense and Narrativ ity: From Medieval Performance to Modern Fiction (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 104, in differentiating between "realis" accounts, which represent the narrated events as "having been realized in the material world," and "irrealis" accounts, which "are verbalizations of experience that is unreal ized either because it is predicated on taking place in the future or because it is in some sense hypothetical." 265</page><page sequence="4">Avraham Walfish hence "specificity." The highly common "casuistic" form of halakhic formulation, consisting of a hypothetical clause (the "protasis") and a resultant clause (the "apo dosis"), possesses, by its very nature, a higher degree of narrativity than apodictic formulations: Casuistic formulations tend to have greater narrativity than apodictic state ments. By virtue of the fact that they contain two clauses, casuistic formu lations almost invariably present two interrelated events. Hence, they are almost always narratives.10 Nevertheless, even apodictic formulations may display a degree of narrativity, par ticularly if they contain elements that focus attention on elements of "specificity." For example, when the Mishnah enjoins a husband just before the entrance of Shabbat to ensure that his wife has done the requisite preparations, the apodictic formulation contains several narrative elements, including a specific time and place and even a line of dialogue: On the eve of the Sabbath just before dark a man must say three things in his house: Have you separated tithes? Have you prepared the 'eruv? Kindle the [Sabbath] lamp. (M Shabbat 2:7) On the other hand, both apodictic and casuistic formulations in the Mishnah may be presented in a manner that reduces their level of narrativity. The "Mishnah's tendency to juxtapose and interweave multiple variants of the same case"11 is illus trated by M. Shabbat 1:1, which presents several successive "narratives" in which the transfer of objects between householders in their homes and poor persons in the public domain takes place in different ways, depending on whose hand is stretched into whose domain and who actively does the taking and the placing of the object. Simon-Shoshan argues that by employing these forms, The Mishnah calls attention to the fact that these events are merely theoretical constructs that can be easily manipulated for heuristic purposes.12 Analyzing a passage structured in similar fashion, M. Shevu'ot Chapter 8, Eliza beth Shanks Alexander has suggested a rather similar idea. Alexander character izes M. Shavu'ot Chapter 8 in the following way: The chapter narrates more than 30 different cases, each resulting from a slightly different configuration of the variables (which bailee, what he said, and what really happened).13 10. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 43. 11. Ibid., 51. 12. Ibid., 54. 13. E. S. Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah: The Shaping Influence of Oral Tradition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 138. 266</page><page sequence="5">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative Inasmuch as Alexander views Mishnah as a performative oral text designed for instructional purposes,14 this series of casuistic statements represents a classic ped agogic exercise for training students in legal thinking. Simon-Shoshan likewise attributes "heuristic purposes" to M. Shabbat 1:1 ; however, in his view, the ped agogic aspect of Mishnah exemplified here is only one part of Mishnah's broader purpose, namely, to present an authoritative system of halakhah. For Simon-Shoshan, the notion of authority is multifaceted, providing specific legal rulings as well as tools for extrapolating from them and conceptualizing them. In his view, there is a dialectical relationship among these purposes. The author itative force of a ruling is enhanced by higher levels of "narrativity," involving greater "concreteness" and "specificity," which ensconce the ruling firmly within a real-life?or lifelike?historical context. On the other hand, "merely theoretical constructs," which can be "easily manipulated," function as a kind of "antistory."15 That is to say that such constructs highlight one of the fundamentally anti-narrative characteristics of halachah [sic] or any system of law or norms. Whereas narratives seek to present a single chain of events, the halachah seeks to encompass all possibilities, potentialities, and eventualities. The all-inclusive nature of law stands in opposition to [the] specific nature of narrative.16 Hence, the interweaving in the Mishnah of diverse formulations, possessing differ ent levels of narrativity, reflects the dialectical interplay in the Mishnah's legal system between the enhancement of conative power and the quest to be all-encom passing.17 The centrality of the notion of authority as a guide to the Mishnah's aims and style is a currently fashionable assumption, influenced by thinkers such as Michel Foucault. This postulate, as well as the specific contours of the notion of authority traced by the Mishnah, will be further discussed later. Moving on to the "realis" narratives?stories that depict concrete one-time events?Simon-Shoshan differentiates several kinds of such narratives in the Mishnah, differing from one another in terms of their degree of specificity as well as their manner of conveying halakhically authoritative information. Nonspe cific narratives include "repeated events," which "record the regular practices of individuals or communities that are deemed to be of normative significance,"18 14. Ibid., esp. 167ff. 15. Emphasis added. Simon-Shoshan borrows the term "antistory" from Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), 56-57. 16. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 54-55. Elsewhere, in the context of discussing stories in the Mishnah, Simon-Shoshan argues in similar fashion that the specificity of mishnaic narra tive enhances their claim to "authenticity and authority" while paradoxically "undermin[ing] their use fulness as didactic tools" (ibid., 114). 17. I have employed the term "dialectical" to describe the interplay between the two counter posed purposes of the halakhic system. Simon-Shoshan, however, generally prefers Bakhtinian cat egories, such as "multivocal." 18. Ibid., 55. 267</page><page sequence="6">Avraham Walfish and "ritual narratives," which "record the sequence of events in legal, cultic, and other rituals."19 In both of these types of narrative, a description of how rabbis or Temple priests normally behave serves a prescriptive purpose.20 Dialogues between two rabbis debating a point of halakhah may also be seen as a form of narrative. The "apex of narrativity in the Mishnah" is the story, possessing both "dynamism" and "specificity" in full measure.21 Stories are divided into three categories. The case story is a "realis" vari ation on the casuistic "irrealis" halakhic statement, presenting a rabbinic ruling in a real-life situation. In exempla, the halakhic ruling is deduced from the actual behavior of a halakhic authority in a concrete case. Inasmuch as the halakhic import of exempla is open to interpretation, there may be doubt regarding the validity of halakhic rulings based on them. Finally, there are etiological narra tives, which "relate the origins of a rabbinic enactment,"22 thus introducing an element of dynamism by describing a shift in halakhic practice. The frequent appearance of etiological stories in the middle of a ritual narrative thus intro duces a dynamic element into these presentations of unchanging halakhic prac tice. It is noteworthy that Simon-Shoshan omits aggadic or partially aggadic narratives from his taxonomy of stories, reinforcing the halakho-centric focus that characterizes his readings of mishnaic narrative, a point to which we shall return later. Concluding his discussion of the different narrative forms deployed by the Mishnah, Simon-Shoshan analyzes a representative chapter, M. Shabbat Chapter 1, in which the apodictic form dominates most of the chapter, but several of the pericopes are structured casuistically, and one pericope, M. 1:4, even contains an actual story, a "transmission story" that narrates the his torical circumstances in which a certain ruling was issued. Simon-Shoshan concludes, To sum up, the first chapter of Shabbat integrates a wide range of forms with varying levels of narrativity into a flowing exposition of activities forbidden on the eve of the Sabbath. The Mishnah easily moves back and forth between various forms of the prescriptive statement, between abstract, Stative clauses and detailed narratives, between prescriptive statements and stories and repeated events. This practice is representative of the way in which the level of narrativity in the Mishnah can fluctuate widely even within a single chapter.23 19. Ibid., 56. 20. Ibid., 58. Simon-Shoshan further differentiates ritual narratives that employ the kotel form from those that employ the katal form, arguing that the former highlight the prescriptive, whereas the latter are more descriptive, and might even be "seen as pseudo-stories, which very closely approximate the experience of an actual story. 21. Ibid., 64. 22. Ibid., 68. 23. Ibid., 77. 268</page><page sequence="7">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative III. The Significance of the Mishnah's Deployment of Narrativity Comparing the Mishnah with other ancient legal collections, including the cuneiform law collections and the legal portions of the Torah, Simon-Shoshan argues that "narrativity" plays a significantly different role in the Mishnah than in these other collections. The latter present master narratives that explain how the legislation was authorized, whereas the laws themselves are presented mostly in "irrealis" casuistic and apodictic formulations, lacking full-fledged legal stories almost entirely. In the Mishnah, on the other hand, with the exception of the opening pericopes of Tractate ' Avot, there is no authorizing master narra tive, but narratives that present or illustrate legal rulings form an integral part of the Mishnah's legal discourse. In this regard, the Mishnah resembles Roman legal collections, compiled roughly contemporaneously, in displaying a broad range of forms, including several types of "irrealis" and "realis" narratives ranging to the full-blown story. Moreover, Roman law is also heterogeneous with regards to the sources cited in it. Unlike the Biblical and cuneiform legal collections, which speak with a single author itative voice, the Digest is made up of a kaleidoscopic array of citations from earlier legal scholars. These scholars, especially Ulpian, in turn make regular reference to still earlier authorities ... Still, there is an important difference between the Mishnah and the Roman sources on this score. Neither Gaius nor the Digest regularly juxtaposes opposing opinions in the manner that we find in the Mishnah in virtually every chapter. Ultimately, the Roman sources aim to present a unified view of the law, whereas the Mishnah regu larly leaves issues unresolved.24 The multiplicity of forms both in the Mishnah and in the Roman collections, as opposed to the more monolithic nature of more ancient Near East legal codes, may reflect their arising within the shared "social and cultural milieu of the late antique Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds."25 Simon-Shoshan further observes, The various forms used by the Mishnah, with their varying degrees of narra tivity, can be seen as representing a different Bakhtinian dialect with its own distinct point of view. Each form reflects a competing voice about the nature of halachah [sic], from a static system of principles to a series of highly con tingent responses to individual cases. By juxtaposing these forms in a single text, the Mishnah embraces all of them.26 This conclusion differs significantly from Jacob Neusner's depiction of Mishnah as "composed of a few different types of declarative statements,"27 a corollary of 24. Ibid., 96. 25. Ibid., 99. 26. Ibid., 79-80. 27. Ibid., 211, based on Neusner's discussion in The Mishnah: An Introduction (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1989), 19. 269</page><page sequence="8">Avraham Walfish Neusner's reading of Mishnah as a philosophical text, in which each tractate is designed to make a coherent and unambiguous statement. By contrast, Simon Shoshan's Bakhtinian findings lead him to conclude that the Mishnah is "an inher ently complex and ambiguous text that cannot be easily reduced to a series of clearcut 'statements.'"28 This conclusion has been anticipated by other scholars,29 and Simon-Shoshan's narratologically based comparison of the Mishnah with other ancient legal collections provides a further analytical tool that buttresses their findings. In the course of cataloguing the different kinds and degrees of "narrativity" deployed by the Mishnah, Simon-Shoshan draws another important conclusion regarding the nature of legal thinking reflected in the ways in which Mishnah tends to formulate its rulings. He suggests that the high degree of "narrativity" in mishnaic formulations may be correlated with Leib Moscovitz's observation30 regarding the scarcity of abstract generalizations and metaphysical terms in the Mishnah: Moscovitz emphasizes the tendency of the Tannaim to avoid abstract concepts in their legal formulations. "Abstract concepts ... may be defined as notions which are intangible and incapable of mental visualization" [Moscovitz 2002 6]. They are "concerned with metaphysical concepts such as causation and potentiality [rather] than with mundane, physical concepts such as doors and spoons" [ibid. 5]. In his survey of the legal generalizations of the Tannaim, Moscovitz finds that they generally "reflect conceptualization at a very low level, both in terms of the scope and the degree of abstraction of these generalizations" [59]. "Explicit Tannaitic generalizations ... do not explicitly mention abstract metaphysical entities such as change, intention, and transience; such statements speak of objects and items familiar from everyday life" [ibid. 55]. According to Moscovitz, true conceptual abstraction does not emerge in halachic thinking until after the Tannaitic period. Even the most generalized of Tannaitic statements contain a certain degree of specificity.31 28. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 212. 29. See, for example, C Hayes, "Between the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds" (PhD diss., University of California at Berkeley, 1993), 37-38: "The bulk of evidence supports a description of the redactors) as the agent of a multivocal community, the servant of conflicting forces... the polyphony has been encoded and preserved by a redactor/editor who exercises a certain amount of literary and rhetorical freedom like any redactor/editor, but who can hardly be said to be authoring a book that rep resents his own conclusions, opinions or agenda." In my "Shitat ha'arikhah hasifrutit bamishnah al-pi massekhet Ro'sh Hashanah" (PhD diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2001), 26 n. 95, I largely concur with this reading, demurring with regard to the redactor's "agenda," which I believe does exist and is encoded in his literary methods of redaction. Similarly, I would argue that underlying the Bakhtinian heteroglossia that Simon-Shoshan finds in the Mishnah, one may detect motifs and ideas that may be "complex" rather than "clearcut" but are nonetheless presented in a coherent and well-structured manner. 30. Leib Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning from Casuistics to Conceptualization (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002). 31. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 33. 270</page><page sequence="9">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative An important methodological issue arises here. Following Moscovitz, Simon Shoshan utilizes linguistic criteria in order to derive conclusions regarding the nature of tannaitic thinking. They argue that the absence of explicit abstractions indicates the lack of conceptualization, and the use of casuistic formulations indi cates thinking responsive to concrete events and fluid situations. However, the reliability of such formalistic linguistic criteria for determining the nature of underlying thought processes may be questioned. For example, Moscovitz has acknowledged that tannaitic sources, while rarely resorting to explicit conceptual formulations, may exhibit "implicit concep tualization."32 However, with the burden of proof firmly thrust on those who would claim to discern such implicit conceptualization,33 rarely will such a claim meet Moscovitz's demanding standards of evidence. Pace Moscovitz, one may argue that the burden of proof ought to be placed on those who would deny implicit conceptualization or be assigned equally to both sides. Moreover, scholars may support the presence of implicit conceptual principles in the Mishnah by careful study of its stylistic and literary features, as demonstrated in different ways and on different levels in my own work and in that of Elizabeth Shanks Alexander.34 Since writing the dissertation, Simon-Shoshan has revisited the issue of "implicit conceptualization," and the book version of the dissertation will clarify that legal thinking of this nature is an integral part of the "authority" structure of the Mishnah. Here, however, we need to address the contribution 32. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, 63 ff, esp. 66-68. 33. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, 63ff, following Yitzhak Englard, rejects Shalom Albeck's "dogmatic, a priori assumptions" that all rabbinic law is grounded in conceptualization, implicit when not explicit. He does not fully accept E. E. Urbach's highly skeptical claim that implicit conceptualiz ation tends to reflect the thinking of the predisposed scholar rather than of the rabbinic texts; however, his own demanding criteria for accepting claims of implicit conceptualization (66ff.) also seem to pre suppose a lack of conceptualization unless proven otherwise. 34. See Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah, 138-39. A further issue that needs clarification is the relationship between conceptualization and formalization. For Moscovitz, conceptualization means roughly the same thing as abstraction and formalistic reasoning. However, legal reasoning, in the view of some scholars, may be grounded in conceptualization of a significantly different kind than abstract formal thought. Chaim Perlman, for example, has argued that legal reasoning is "rhetorical" in nature, and David Kraemer, "Composition and Meaning in the Bavli," Prooftexts 8 (1988): 273ff; and idem, The Mind of the Talmud (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), lOOff, has suggested that the reasoning of the Bavli corresponds to this model. Benjamin Brown, "Hahazon ish: halakhah, 'emunah vehevrah" (PhD diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2003), 86-100, has argued that the Hazon Ish (Rabbi Abraham Isaiah Karelitz), who opposed the "analytic" school of tal mudic conceptualization founded by R. Haim Soloveitchik of Brisk, operated with a case-sensitive, nonabstract form of conceptualization. My work in the Mishnah suggests that here, too, nonabstract forms of conceptualization predominate. A possible interrelationship between this point and the rela tively high degree of "narrativity" in the Mishnah might be indicated on the basis of a distinction suggested by B. S. Jackson, Studies in the Semiotics of Biblical Law (Sheffield, UK: Sheffield Univer sity Press, 2000), 79, between the "semantic" model of legal formulation, in which cases must be judged on the basis of defining the terms of the law and seeing whether they apply to the case at hand, and the "narrative" model, in which the law is "applied to the typical cases whose images are evoked by the words of the rule." 271</page><page sequence="10">Avraham Walfish that Simon-Shoshan believes "narrativity" grants to the Mishnah's system, namely the categories of "dynamism" and "specificity." Let us consider what might happen, for example, if we were to replace the actual formulation of M. Shabbat 2:7 (cited earlier) regarding the instructions of a husband to his wife as the entrance of Shabbat approaches with alternative formu lations in which the degree of "narrativity" is varied:35 Actual text (specific apodictic): On the eve of the Sabbath just before dark a man must say three things in his house: Have you separated tithes? Have you prepared the 'eruv! Kindle the [Sabbath] lamp. Diminished narrativity (abstract apodictic): A man must ensure that his family completes the Sabbath preparations before the advent of Shabbat. He should enquire whether they have separated tithes and pre pared the 'eruv, and he should direct them to light the Sabbath lamp. Augmented narrativity (casuistic, greater specificity): If a man has not per sonally attended to the completion of the Sabbath preparations, then on the eve of the Sabbath just before dark he should say three things to his wife: Have you separated tithes from the grain, the fruit, and the vegetables? Have you contributed food for the 'eruvl Kindle the [Sabbath] lamp. Based on Simon-Shoshan's categories, we would suggest that the varying degrees of "narrativity" in these formulations reflect different trade-offs between the con flicting demands of rooting the halakhah in a concrete social milieu and of enabling the jurist to apply it and extrapolate from it. However, one might suggest that selection of the first (actual) formulation rather than the other (theor etical) ones may have been governed by rather different factors, which might include the sources available to the redactor, elegance of style, and use of key words (in our case, e.g., "house," a word that plays a central role in many related sources). A further factor that may have influenced the degree of "narrativ ity" in mishnaic formulations emerges from comparing passages in the Mishnah with parallel formulations in other tannaitic collections. For example, frequently the Mishnah will present succinctly the bottom-line conclusion of a dialogue narrated in a baraita '. An instance of this phenomenon is the following:36 35. The alternative texts presented here are entirely theoretical and appear nowhere in talmudic sources. 36. This example compares the Mishnah to a baraita ' cited in the Talmud, but there are many similar examples that emerge from comparing the Mishnah to baraitot in the Tosefta or in tannaitic mid rashim. For instance, in T. Zavim 1:5-6, responding to R. Akiva's invitation to his disciples, R. Eliezer ben Judah cites a limiting condition regarding a dispute between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai. R. Akiva chides his disciple for failing to produce a reason for this claim, followed by a reason suggested by R. Simeon, which R. Akiva accepts and teaches in R. Simeon's name. M. Zavim 1:1 merely cites the limiting condition in the name of R. Eliezer ben Judah. 272</page><page sequence="11">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative Rabban Gamliel says: Three women knead dough together and bake in the oven one after the other; The Sages say: Three women occupy themselves with the dough?one kneads, one rolls out, and one bakes. R. Akiva says: Not all women and not all wood and not all ovens are equal. This is the general rule: If it rises, she should wet it with cool water. (M. Pesahim 3:4) It was taught [in a baraita ']: R. Akiva said: I discussed the following before Rabban Gamliel: Teach us, our master?[are we dealing] with quick women or with slow women, with damp wood or with dry wood, with a hot oven or a cool oven? He said to me: You have only what the Sages have said: This is the general rule: If it rises, she should wet it with cool water. (B. Pesahim 48b) Clearly the "realis" dialogue cited in the baraita ' possesses a higher degree of "narrativity" than does the mishnaic parallel, but does it reflect a different mode of halakhic reasoning or a different model of halakhic authority? Is it not more plausible to suggest that the choice of preserving a live dialogue between two auth orities or simply presenting their two opinions side by side is governed by the lit erary nature of the source? Namely, the baraita ' serves as "minutes" of a legal discussion, whereas the tightly redacted canonical Mishnah distills the precise halakhic content from the statements of the two interlocutors.37 In fairness to Simon-Shoshan, it should be noted that he does not claim exclusivity for his expla nations, and indeed there are points at which he allows room for explanations of "narrativity" rooted in other assumptions and other methods. However, given the existence of plausible alternatives, I think that the explanations suggested by Simon-Shoshan for the importance of varying degrees of "narrativity" stand in need of further justification. The example from Tractate Pesahim calls into question a further assumption that guides much of Simon-Shoshan's discussion: that rooting a halakhic ruling in concrete "narrative" reality enhances its conative force. Here the formulation of the Mishnah is more abstract and the formulation of the baraita ' is more concrete, both regarding the details of the case and regarding the specifics of the rabbinic discussion. However, the authoritative claim of R. Akiva's apodictic ruling in the Mishnah is clearly stronger than the more concrete but interrogative formu lation of the baraita'3* More generally, I would argue that the authoritative 37. In somewhat similar fashion, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah, 54, has argued that differences in formulation between the Mishnah and the Tosefta may reflect the fact "that the materials preserved in the Mishnah and the Tosephta [sic] were performed in different contexts with different pedagogical purposes." I would suggest that such differences may be rooted in literary, as well as in "performative," considerations, and that these considerations might be conceptual as well as "pedagogical." 38. Elsewhere, Simon-Shoshan argues that comparison of mishnaic narrative with parallel ver sions brought in baraitot usually reveals the Mishnah to favor "Spartan narrative," "strip[ped]... of all mimetic detail," thus rendering the material appropriate to "theoretical halakhic discourse" but less appropriate to showing "how halakhic practice might be integrated into a broader life experience" (Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhic Mimesis," 120*?21*). Here as well, the notion that "mimetic details" are designed to render the halakhic discourse truer to life stands in need of support; see the discussion herein of the "illustrative" and "representative" functions of narrative. 273</page><page sequence="12">Avraham Walfish force of a ruling may often be better advanced by abstracting it from the hurly burly of historical circumstances than by illustrating its connection to concrete real-life situations, an argument to which I will return later. Simon-Shoshan's working assumption that the structures of mishnaic language reflect the nature of halakhic thinking appears to be grounded in the lit erary discipline of "narratology," developed by scholars such as Gerald Prince39 and Suzanne Fleischman,40 which undergirds his taxonomy of mishnaic narrative forms. In line with the structuralist foundations of this discipline, linguistic forms are assumed to reflect deep structures of thought. Scholars who do not share the structuralist persuasion will require further evidence for the presupposition that analyzing formal features of Mishnah's linguistic usage may yield reliable infor mation regarding the deep structures of mishnaic thought. The questions I have raised regarding the use of the tools of narratology to draw conclusions about the nature of tannaitic legal thought do not detract from Simon-Shoshan's contri bution: his taxonomy of narrative forms in the Mishnah, as well as his important comparison of the roles played by "narrativity" in the Mishnah and in other ancient legal connections. IV. Readings of Stories?Mishnaic Aggadah The second half of Simon-Shoshan's dissertation presents an interpretive model for mishnaic stories. Here, too, he follows the lead of structuralism and Russian formalism, interpreting mishnaic stories in light of "narrative struc tures,"41 which?following Jonathan Culler42 and Barbara Herrnstein-Smith43? he understands to be "heuristic constructs created by the interpreter so that he or she can better understand the story and its relationship to other stories and situ ations."44 The narrative structure proposed by Simon-Shoshan for mishnaic stories is grounded in the view of scholars such as Martin Jaffee who have described the rabbis as an embattled group, struggling against fierce competition from ideologi cal opponents to establish and enforce their authority over a far-from-unified Jewish population.45 Accordingly, [C]laims to specificity and factuality are crucial to the way in which Mishnaic stories function as transmitters of laws and values. The fact that the stories are 39. The Grammar of Stories (The Hague: Mouton, 1973). 40. Fleischman, Tense and Narrativity. 41. Simon-Shoshan draws here on S.

Stories deal with one and only one situation, which is irretrievably set in the past. Since no situation ever repeats itself exactly, stories never directly address a current situation. It is up to the interpreter to establish a link between the events described in the story and the situation at hand. There is thus always an element of subjectivity and ambiguity involved in the application of legal or moral principle allegedly derived from a story.47 Simon-Shoshan draws on contemporary poststructuralist literary theory, arguing that only when read "with the grain" do rabbinic stories provide unequivocal support for rabbinic authority; however, when read "against the grain," they "reveal seams, gaps, and ambiguities that undermine their surface portrayal of rab binic hegemony."48 Simon-Shoshan argues that one must always question the objectivity of the mishnaic narrator, whose narration of the story may be weighted in favor of an interpretation that supports his own point of view. In some cases, Simon-Shoshan draws on extra-mishnaic sources, including parallel rabbinic sources as well as nonrabbinic sources such as Josephus, in order both to call the factuality of the mishnaic narrative into question and to uncover the ideological agenda underlying the way in which the Mishnah has told the tale. He thus dis covers an inner tension in the Mishnah's presentation of stories: While the stories "consistently portray rabbis as authority figures within the halachic commu nity,"49 they nonetheless frequently call that authority into question. Ultimately, [They] present the Mishnah's students with a sophisticated and realistic model for the functioning of rabbinic authority ... rabbinic authority stands despite challenges to centralized authority and the ultimately subjective and ambigu ous nature of rabbinic rulings.50 46. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 114. 47. Ibid., 114. 48. Ibid., 106. In arguing for a "more nuanced portrayal of rabbis and their authority," Simon Shoshan (ibid., 104-106) compares mishnaic stories to chreiae, the sage stories common in classical literature. Even though H. Fischel, "Studies in Cynicism and the Ancient Near East," in Religions in Antiquity, ed. J. Neusner (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968), 409; and C. Hezser, "Interfaces Between Rabbinic Literature and Graeco-Roman Philosophy," in The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture, ed. Schaefer and C. Hezser (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000), 2:167, have observed that the rabbis "hala khized" chreiae, there is a significant difference between these stories, designed to demonstrate the wisdom of the sage, and the halakhic rabbinic story, designed for legal purposes.

Ibid., 214. 275</page><page sequence="14">Avraham Walfish The "discourse of authority," which serves as Simon-Shoshan's "narrative struc ture" for interpreting mishnaic stories, may be a central concern of contemporary scholars, but I would question whether this issue was as central a concern for the mishnaic narrators. Granting the postulate that the Mishnah was compiled at a time when embattled rabbis were struggling to assert their authority over a fragmented Jewish community, the centrality of the issue of rabbinic authority would still depend on the "intended reader" whom the Mishnah is designed to address.51 Based on the Mishnah's sophisticated literary qualities,52 and/or the "performa tive" features of the Mishnah advanced by Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, it is reasonable to assume that the Mishnah was designed for rabbis and/or for rabbinic scholars in training, for whom presumably rabbinic authority is a given. This does not preclude that the Mishnah might seek at times to "preach to the converted" and reinforce rabbinic authority for its devotees. Indeed, it is an incontrovertible fact that many narratives in talmudic sources do address issues related to rabbinic auth ority. However, if internal textual evidence supports postulating an "in-house" rab binic "intended reader" of the mishnaic stories, then reinforcement of rabbinic authority may be presumed to play a more marginal role than that assigned to it by Simon-Shoshan and several other contemporary scholars. The use of the "discourse of authority" as a narrative structure is rooted in a further assumption that warrants investigation, namely, that there is a clear corre lation between halakhic authority and the authenticity afforded by anchoring legal rulings in "material and historical reality."53 Halakhic authorities have debated whether the authority of a ruling is enhanced or diminished by rooting it in a real-life setting rather than in a theoretical discussion,54 and to the best of my knowledge, the approach to this issue in talmudic literature has yet to be 51. Here I am following the lead of Steven Fraade, From Tradition to Commentary (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 18; and David Kraemer, "The Intended Reader and the Bavli," Prooftexts 13 (1993): 125-40, who have analyzed, respectively, tannaitic midrashim and the Babylonian Talmud on the basis of attempting to reconstruct from the text who was its intended reader. The method is grounded, of course, in the work of "reader-response" theorists such as Wolfgang Iser and Michael Riffaterre. 52. As demonstrated in my work on the Mishnah. The argument here is based on Yonah Fraen kel's correlation of the sophisticated literary features of aggadic literature with the rabbinic beit midrash audience for whom it is intended. Regarding the "intended reader" of aggadic literature, M. D. Herr, '"Aggadah umidrash be'olamam shel Hazal b'erez yisra'el: Mekomot hithavut, sibbot zemihah uzmanei 'arikhah," in Higayon L'Yona, ed. J. Levinson et al. (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2006), 134 39, accepts a modified version of Fraenkel's claim, noting that Fraenkel himself has presented a some what modified version of this claim in some of his writings. Using different methods, Steven Fraade {From Tradition to Commentary) and David Kraemer ("The Intended Reader and the Bavli," 132 33, 138) arrive at similar conclusions regarding the "intended readers" of the Sifre to Deuteronomy and the Bavli. 53. It bears noting once again that, in Simon-Shoshan's view, halakhic authority is simul taneously enhanced and diminished by being rooted in concrete historical reality: enhanced by the auth enticity of a real-life ruling and diminished by the questions attending the extrapolation of a specific ruling to other cases. 54. See the interesting debate on this issue recorded in the Responsa of R. Naftali Zvi Yehudah Berlin, Meshiv Davar (Jerusalem, 57282), 1:24. 276</page><page sequence="15">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative investigated. Hence, one cannot take as axiomatic the assumption that rabbinic stories aim to enhance authority by providing a real-life anchor for rabbinic rulings. Even though Simon-Shoshan focuses his readings of stories primarily on the "discourse of authority," he does recognize that rabbinic stories may have other goals as well. Drawing on the work of the psychologist Richard Gerrig, he notes that one of the purposes of narrative is to give the reader the sensation of "being transported" into a "narrative world" that is at once similar and dissimilar to the reader's day-to-day reality.56 In a recent article, he develops this theme further, following Robert Scholes and Robert Kellogg in distinguishing between "illustrative" and "representational" narratives. Rhetorical writing is "illustrative, focusing single-mindedly on a didac tic or ideological message, "eliminating] any details that might distract or detract from this purpose."57 Literary writing, on the other hand, rather than focusing on a particular argument, is "representational," namely, it "introduces details and infor mation with the goal of constructing a compelling narrative world for the reader."58 Simon-Shoshan believes that virtually all narratives may be read from either a "representational" or an "illustrative" point of view, but he argues that the halakhic focus and sparse detail of rabbinic stories accentuates their predomi nantly "illustrative" design.59 This is true in particular of the Mishnah, as emerges when comparing mish naic narratives to parallel versions preserved in baraitot: 55. For example, although the rabbis likely were well aware that midrashic stories frequently did not accurately reflect either the plain sense of the biblical text or the historical reality (this is the view of Y. Fraenkel, Darkhei ha'aggadah vehamidrash [Givatayim: Yad Hatalmud, 1991], 83-85, many scholars would modify this view to a greater or a lesser extent, but few scholars would erase entirely the gap between scripture's plain sense and midrashic interpretation), they did not refrain from deriving halakhic conclusions from them. See, for example, B. Berakhot 60a, which discusses the boundaries of acceptable prayer in light of a midrash that Leah prayed to have her fetus's gender changed. It may be argued that, while halakhic authority may sometimes be grounded in fictional stories, the rabbis regarded historically accurate stories as superior sources of authority. However, the correspondence of such a claim to the thrust of rabbinic thought is not obvious and would need to be supported. 56. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 178-79, citing Richard J.

Simon-Shoshan qualifies this conclusion to some degree by stating, "A full understanding of these phenomena must await a broad study of the sty listics and editorial considerations of the composers of rabbinic sage stories." 277</page><page sequence="16">Avraham Walfish The concise and focused style of the Mishnah leans more towards illustrative storytelling, whereas the baraita's tendency toward less tightly woven texts is typical of representational storytelling.60 Moreover, even when Simon-Shoshan does read stories from a "representational" point of view, his focus continues to be firmly halakho-centric. Regarding M. Sukkah 2:5, in which a narrative about R. Zadok is used to illustrate an apo dictic ruling, Simon-Shoshan remarks, The editors of the Mishnah deploy this narrative world as a bridge between their apodictic ruling ... and the "real world" of the student's own halachic practice.61 Ultimately, the Mishnah seeks to draw the reader into its narrative world in order to root halakhic authority in the "real world," rather than for the aesthetic, emotional, moral, or philosophical effects which "representational" readers of literary narra tives normally seek. The halakho-centric narrative world of rabbinic authority into which some mishnaic narratives seek to draw the reader remains for Simon Shoshan more "illustrative" than "representational," inasmuch as the goals are focused on halakhic authority. The "representational" features of the mishnaic nar rative may add color and complexity to the "illustrative" narrative, but they do not overshadow the ultimately "illustrative" purpose. Simon-Shoshan subjects even narratives generally considered to be aggadic to "illustrative" readings, as exemplified by his reading of the story of Honi the circle drawer in M. Ta'anit 3:8: A. On every misfortune that may come upon the community they fast except for excess rain. B. It happened that the people said to Honi the circle drawer, pray for rain to fall. He replied: go and bring in the ovens of the paschal offerings so that they do not dis solve. He prayed and no rain fell. What did he do? He drew a circle and stood within it and exclaimed, master of the universe, Your children have turned to me for I am as a member of Your household; I swear by Your great Name that I will not move from here until You have mercy upon your children. Rain then began to drip. He said: it is not this that I have requested, but rather rain [to fill] cisterns, ditches and caves. The rain began to come down with great force. He said: it is not this that I have requested, but rather rain of goodwill, blessing, and benevolence. They descended normally, until the Israelites ascended from 60. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhic Mimesis," 121*. Simon-Shoshan qualifies this generalization somewhat, noting that the Mishnah "tends to present stories that are crafted to fit a particular halakhic argument," but, "Most mishnaic stories contain some details that are extraneous to, and even under mine, the halakhic point they are supposed to make" (121*?22*). 61. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 179-80. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhic Mimesis," 120*?21*, describes the function of "mimetic details" in rabbinic narratives in a similar fashion.

They said to him: in the same way as you prayed for [the rain] to fall pray for it to depart. He replied: go and see if the stone of claimants has been washed away. C. Simeon b. Shetah sent to him: were you not Honi I would have placed you under the ban, but what can I do to you, since you act up before God and He fulfills his desires, like a son who acts up before his father and he fulfills his desires; of you scripture says: Let your father and thy mother be glad, and let her that bore you rejoice (Proverbs 23:25). In Simon-Shoshan's reading,62 the first part of the story (section B) serves as an exemplum, in which, despite the fact that Honi is a miracle worker, normally not viewed as a classic rabbinic figure, his behavior nevertheless serves to exem plify the halakhic principle enunciated in section A?not petitioning God to remedy the danger of excessive rainfall.63 However, in section C, the authority implicitly accorded to Honi in section B is challenged by the quintessential rabbi nic authority of his time, Simeon ben Shetah. Simon-Shoshan examines various suggestions regarding the reason why Simeon ben Shetah believes Honi to be worthy of excommunication, concluding, There is likely at least some truth in all of these theories. The common denominator between them is that Honi flouts the norms whereby the 62. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 198-204. 63. Aside from the main point of discussion regarding reading strategies, there are further issues that affect the validity of Simon-Shoshan's reading. Not all scholars agree that the Honi narrative indeed exemplifies the rule of section A; see the discussion by Suzanne Last Stone, "On the Interplay of Rules, 'Cases,' and Concepts in Rabbinic Legal Literature: Another Look at the Aggadot on Honi the Circle Drawer," Dine Israel 24 (2004): 136*-43*, and literature cited at 136* n. 34. Even if the Mishnah intends Honi's behavior at the end of section B to exemplify the principle stated in section A, Yonah Fraenkel has repeatedly cautioned against taking the editorial purposes of the redactor as a fully reliable guide to the meaning of the story. Moreover, attention should be paid to a subtle but poten tially significant difference between sections A and B: Section A discourages fasting as a method of halting rains, whereas section B knows only of prayer. Insofar as fasting is a far more drastic form of behavior than prayer, one might differentiate between them in this context, and Honi thus emerges as one who?quite characteristically for "miracle workers"?exceeds the mandate of the hala khah, indicating that his behavior ought to be understood in aggadic, rather than in halakhic, categories. Moreover, it may be (cf. Lerner, cited by Stone, 136* n. 34) that the statement in section A is not the source of Honi's behavior but rather its result, in which case I would suggest that section A be read as an aggadic imperative rather than a halakhic ruling. The location of the general statement, referring to fasting, prior to the case relating to prayer on which it is based, may be explained as the redactor's way of justifying the introduction of the Honi narrative at this point by means of a bridging unit: Section A both concludes the previous {halakhic) discussion of occasions for fasting and introduces the Honi narrative by discouraging petitions against excessive rainfall. Simon-Shoshan notes (136 n. 174) that some commentators, led by Maimonides in his Mishnah commentary, have suggested that Honi did in fact pray for the cessation of the rain, thus flouting the principle stated in section A. As noted by R. Yosef Kafih in his editorial note to the Maimonidean commentary, Maimonides seems not to have a clear source for this comment, and in any event Maimonides' commentary is designed to interpret the Mishnah in light of talmudic interpretation, regardless of whether the plain sense of the Mishnah supports such a reading. 279</page><page sequence="18">Avraham Walfish rabbis and their followers pray to God for rain, and that the violation of those norms in one way or another threatens rabbinic authority.64 Shrewdly noting that Simeon ben Shetah's characterization of Honi as a spoiled child ironically inverts Honi's earlier self-characterization as a member of God's household, Simon-Shoshan suggests that the verse cited by Simeon ben Shetah be read as a theological complaint, in light of the preceding verse (Proverbs 23:24): "The father of a righteous man will exult, he who begets a wise son will rejoice in him."65 Why, Simeon wonders, does God appear to rejoice in a spoiled and disrespectful son, such as Honi, rather than in a wise son (such as Simeon ben Shetah)? Honi's authority as exemplar, therefore, cannot be rooted in his conformity to normative rabbinic practice, and Simeon ben Shetah's highly conflicted response to Honi's behavior reflects the Mishnah's ambivalence regarding the authority that ought to be accorded to a nonrabbinic miracle worker such as Honi. Simon-Shoshan's discussion includes important literary insights, such as the inverted parallel between Simeon's characterization of Honi and Honi's self characterization. However, these "representational" features ultimately are subor dinated in Simon-Shoshan's reading to the halakho-centric point of the story: the ambivalent attitude toward granting authoritative halakhic standing to a nonrabbi nic miracle worker. If we pay careful attention to the details of the story, I believe that they provide little support for focusing it on the issue of rabbinic authority and tend toward a reading focused on other issues. Simeon ben Shetah's plaintive statement to Honi contains no reference to issues of authority,66 and it clearly indi cates which feature of Honi's behavior disturbs him: behaving toward God like his spoiled child is inappropriate and worthy of disciplinary measures in its own right, regardless of whether it upsets any rabbinic norm. 64. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 201. 65. Simon-Shoshan also suggests that perhaps "Simeon b. Shetah's words are not a theological complaint, but merely a rationalization meant to explain how someone like Honi could flaunt the rabbis" (204). This reading is closer to the standard understanding of the story, reading Simeon's cita tion of Proverbs 23:25 as standing on its own, without any implied allusion to the previous verse. 66. Simeon ben Shetah's frustration at being unable to place Honi under the ban is not a limit ation on his authority but a recognition that it would be theologically unacceptable to exercise his auth ority. If we accept Simon-Shoshan's suggestion that Simeon's citation of Proverbs 23:25 alludes to the previous verse as well, then this would imply dismay on his part that God accords a sympathetic hearing to a prayer that reflects on his son's impudence rather than on his wisdom or righteousness. Simeon's consternation, then, would reflect his identification with the rabbinic values of wisdom and righteous ness, as opposed to Honi's spiritualistic piety. However, here as well, it is the rabbinic value system that is being challenged, and I see no warrant here for Simon-Shoshan's identification of challenges to rab binic norms with challenges to rabbinic authority. Suzanne Last Stone, "Aggadot on Honi the Circle Drawer," 138*-40*, cogently suggests that the mishnaic narrative employs Honi and Simeon to exem plify the problematic status of hasidim in the eyes of the rabbis. However, I think our story clearly indi cates that the rabbis' attitude toward these figures was ambivalent rather than uniformly negative, and I would add that the Mishnah accords a similar role to the yehidim (individuals) of the first chapter of Tractate Ta'anit (M. Ta'anit 1:4, 7). Cf. my brief remarks on the role of the yehidim in "Shitat Ha' arikhah," 13. 280</page><page sequence="19">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative Several other details in the story direct the reader to issues of theological pro priety rather than of rabbinic authority. While rabbinic literature knows of other? rare?instances in which human beings have attempted to force God's hand by issuing an ultimatum,67 Honi's threat not to move from his circle is unique, and its impudence has a childlike quality, linking up with the "child" imagery repeated throughout the story. Repeatedly God bows to Honi's importuning, but always in a manner that evinces reluctance, thus expressing his displeasure at surrendering to Honi's demanding tone. When Simeon ben Shetah simultaneously complains about Honi's behavior and marvels in puzzled admiration at God's tolerance toward his wayward son,68 he is in fact echoing in words God's ambivalence toward Honi's audacity, as expressed in the divine deed of granting nonbeneficent rain. Reading this story as an aggadic narrative, employing literary tools "rep resentationally" to dramatize the tension between different modes of relating to God, enables a cohesive and meaningful understanding of details and nuances that the "discourse of authority" bypasses. These details seemed designed to "con struct a compelling narrative world" that portrays a complex tangle of religious and personal tensions rather than to convey a single-minded ideological message. Tractate Ta'anit, which has devoted extensive attention to defining and refining the halakhically sanctioned modes of petitioning God, employs this Aggadah to expand the theological and behavioral frontiers established by the halakhah. Focusing the narrative on rabbinic authority both introduces an element whose textual foundation is shaky and deflects attention from the dramatic epicenter of the story. Simon-Shoshan comments briefly on this story in his recent article, observing that "the initial halakhic context in which it is introduced is swept away by the wonder and complexity of the story."69 I believe that this rep resents a significant advance over the model presented in the dissertation and offers a more nuanced understanding of the complex interaction of halakhah and Aggadah in rabbinic narratives. Some stories in the Mishnah, of course, do clearly address the issue of rabbinic authority. However, here too we will arrive at significantly different readings by approaching the story from an "illustrative" or from a "representational" perspective. The clash between Rabban Gamliel and R. Joshua in M. Ro'sh Hashanah 2:8-9, regarding the sanctification of the New Moon and the date of Yom Kippur, is an aggadic story in which the issue of authority clearly occupies center stage:70 67. See, for example, Hannah's threat in B. Berakhot 3 lb to "force" God to grant her a child by undergoing the ordeal of the wayward woman. 68. Some of Simon-Shoshan's formulations indicate that he sees Simeon ben Shetah as main taining an unequivocally negative position regarding Honi: "Simeon b. Shetah has nothing but scorn for Honi. He is outraged to have met his match in such a character" (Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 203). As noted, I believe that the language of the story suggests that Simeon relates to Honi in a more nuanced and ambivalent manner. 69. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhic Mimesis," 122*. 70.

On another occasion two witnesses came and said, we saw it at its proper time, but on the following night (lit. "of its pregnancy") it was not seen, and Rabban Gamliel accepted them (kibelam). Rabbi Dosa b. Harkinas said: they are false witnesses? How can someone testify that a woman has given birth when on the next day we see her belly between her "teeth"? Said R. Joshua to him: I rule in accordance with your words. B. Rabban Gamliel sent to him to say, I decree upon you to appear before me with your staff and your money on the day which according to your reckoning should be the Day of Atonement. C. R. Akiva went [to R. Joshua] and found him in great distress. He said to him: I can bring proof [from the scripture] that whatever Rabban Gamliel has done is valid, because it says, "these are the appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim ..." (Leviticus 23:4)?whether at their proper time or not at their proper time, I have no appointed seasons besides these. D. He [R Joshua] came to R. Dosa b. Harkinas. He said to him: if we call in question the beth din of Rabban Gamliel, we must call in question every beth din which has stood (she- 'amad) since the days of Moses up to the present time. For it says, "Then went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel." (Exodus 24:9) Why were not the names of the elders mentioned? To show that every group of three which has stood (she- 'amad) as a bet din over Israel is considered like the bet din of Moses. E. He [R. Joshua] took his staff and his money and went to Yavneh to Rabban Gamliel on the day on which the Day of Atonement fell according to his reckon ing. Rabban Gamliel stood (amad) and kissed him on his head and said to him: come in peace, my teacher and my disciple?my teacher in wisdom and my dis ciple because you have accepted (shekibalta) my words. Simon-Shoshan notes that, in contradistinction to the immediately preceding nar rative in the Mishnah, in which R. Gamliel has the last word, this story presents a serious and sustained challenge to R. Gamliel's authority. R. Gamliel's concern for maintaining his court's authority is in evidence from the very opening of the story, where, despite the fact that the witnesses' testimony is clearly contradicted by facts that emerge after the court has issued its ruling?the moon is not visible the fol lowing night?R. Gamliel nevertheless refuses to reverse his ruling.71 The sever ity of the challenge to R. Gamliel's authority is reflected, in Simon-Shoshan's view, in the ridiculing tone of R. Dosa's objection, as well as in the fact that the dispute affects the date for observing Yom Kippur, thus threatening to divide 71. As Simon-Shoshan notes, this reading is based on Rashi's and Tiferet Yisrael's construal of the words lo nir'ah as meaning that on the second night, following the court's ruling, nobody, including the members of the court, saw the new moon. Other commentators follow Maimonides' understanding that these words were spoken by the witnesses, who arrived a day late and seek to have the new month established retroactively. This reading would lead to a significantly different understanding of R. Gam liel's position, as I have noted in "Shitat ha'arikhah," 91-93, and in "Halakic Confrontation Drama tized: A Study of Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 2:8-9," Hebrew Union College Annual 79 (forthcoming). 282</page><page sequence="21">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative the community into those accepting the officially sanctioned date and those observing the holiest of days at another time. Simon-Shoshan analyzes the various stages of this clash over authority, dis cussing, among other issues, why R. Gamliel directs his decree only at R. Joshua rather than at R. Dosa and why R. Dosa appears to reverse his position, persuading R. Joshua to bow to R. Gamliel's decree after having so harshly opposed R. Gam liel's ruling. In the final scene, R. Gamliel expresses his ambivalent attitude toward R. Joshua, acknowledging that on the level of theoretical discussion, there is room for more than one point of view and indeed R. Joshua may be superior to him, despite the fact that R. Joshua has acknowledged the sole overriding authority of R. Gamliel. Simon-Shoshan argues, [T]he legitimacy of R. Gamliel's political and practical halachic authority is ultimately upheld. However, there is a strong undercurrent in this story that undermines these claims. From R. Dosa's initial complaint through R. Akiva's argument, to R. Gamliel's own concluding statement, the story consistently asserts that, from an intellectual point of view, R. Gamliel was simply wrong. While, on one level, this may serve to highlight the extent of R. Gamliel's political power, in the final analysis, it shows R. Gamliel in an unflattering light. This can hardly be in the best interest of R. Gamliel and his successors.72 For Simon-Shoshan, both aspects of the reading, the "with the grain" confirmation of R. Gamliel's authority and the "against the grain" demonstration of the frayed edges of this authority, are rooted in the interpretive decision to read the story in an "illustrative" mode, focusing on authority as a brute fact to be affirmed or rejected (or, on some level, both). By contrast, approaching the story with a "close reading" approach, we will discover important textual cues that indicate it is designed to focus attention on Rabbi Joshua and his inner conflict rather than on Rabban Gamliel's authority per se. The five scenes of the story all include Rabbi Joshua, focusing, respectively, on his halakhic ruling (A), the draconian decree upon him (B), his inner turmoil (opening of C), the arguments designed to resolve his inner conflict (C-D), his trek to Yavneh (E), and finally Rabban Gamliel's encomium to him (E). Reading with the grain, the story reveals a host of psychological and spiri tual insights, focusing on the dramatic inner conflict among central values, includ ing intellectual integrity, theological probity, respect for authority, and social cohesion.73 Beyond this, however, close reading also affords a different approach to the issue of R. Gamliel's authority than the reading offered by Simon-Shoshan. The story's sophisticated model of authority is intimated by two significant word plays (highlighted in the story by bold print and italics). K-b-l, "accept," forms an inclusio, appearing at the beginning and the end of the story in two different 72. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 151. 73. See my brief discussion in "Shitat Ha'arikhah," 97-99, and the fuller discussion in "Halakic Confrontation Dramatized." 283</page><page sequence="22">Avraham Walfish meanings: Rabban Gamliel accepts problematic witnesses, in an apparently arbi trary exercise of judicial authority, and Rabbi Joshua ultimately accepts Rabban Gamliel's authority. The interrelationship between these two meanings of k-b-l suggests that Rabban Gamliel's authority, while extensive, is ultimately derived from the willing acceptance of the community, or at least of his fellow scholars. The dialectical conception of authority as a bilateral relationship between free agents is further underscored by the contrast between '-m-d, "stood," in Rabbi Dosa's homily, denoting recognition by the community of Rabban Gam liel's authority, and Rabban Gamliel standing to honor the submissive Rabbi Joshua. The halakhic discourse regarding calendar management is enriched by a story that embodies important halakhic rulings in an aggadic framework, addres sing an intended reader alive to literary cues and interested in rabbinic personal ities and dilemmas, as well as in their authoritative bottom line. Read literarily, this story still focuses on rabbinic authority, but in a "representational" rather than an "illustrative" manner. No less significant to the storyteller than the ques tion as to who possesses authority are the theological, social, spiritual, and psycho logical ramifications of the clash between authority and other values. The story thus confers upon the concept of rabbinic authority personal meaning, psychologi cal resonance, and spiritual depth, which do not emerge from an "illustrative" reading of the story.74 Simon-Shoshan's analysis of the two narratives discussed here indicates the halakho-centric nature of his reading of mishnaic narrative. While he argues cogently in his introduction that scholars have overemphasized the "literary" fea tures of the aggadic narrative, at the expense of the far more predominant halakhic narratives in the Mishnah, it appears to this reader that he has swung the pendulum too far in the opposite direction, focusing on the "illustrative" features of the text even in aggadic narratives that invite more "representational" readings. It bears noting once again that Simon-Shoshan does intersperse "representational" insights in his largely "illustrative" discussions, and in his recent article, he appears to be more receptive to reading some of the stories in the Mishnah in a more "represen tational" and less "illustrative" manner. V. Readings of Stories?Mishnaic Halakhah The main thrust of Simon-Shoshan's discussion, as outlined in his introduc tion, is to describe the features and analyze the purpose of the predominant form of narrative in the Mishnah, namely, the halakhic narrative. Arguing in his 74. A further difference between Simon-Shoshan's reading strategy and a "representational" approach relates to the role in this story of R. Dosa. Simon-Shoshan struggles with the apparent reversal of R. Dosa's position, from harsh criticism and open rebellion in scene A to submissive loyalty in scene D, ultimately inclining toward the suggestion of Daniel Schwartz?since then published in his article, "Mikohanim biyeminam lenotzrim bismolam: leferusho vehitpathuto shel sippur mishna'i (m. Ro'sh Hashanah 2:8-9)," Tarbiz 74 (1): 2005, 21-41?that in scene D, it is R. Joshua who attempts to per suade R. Dosa to accept R. Gamliel's ruling, not the other way around. However, close examination of the language and nuances of the story fail to support this reading, as I have argued in my article, "Ha'immut hahilkhati be'izuv dramati." 284</page><page sequence="23">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative introduction that halakhic authority is enhanced by authoritative historical pre cedent, he proceeds in the second part of the dissertation to analyze many halakhic narratives with the tools of the "discourse of authority." Reading the halakhic "exempla," which are "the quintessential Mishnaic narrative texts,"75 Simon Shoshan generally poses questions such as the following: Is the story authentic, or are there sources that call part or all of the story into question? Is the halakhic conclusion from the story clear-cut, or is it subject to alternative interpretations? Is the figure described in the story truly an authoritative figure whom we may prop erly regard as exemplary, or may we dismiss his example as lacking authority? Time and again Simon-Shoshan discovers that the "perfect fit" between the deeds of a rabbi and general halachic principles is at best an illusion generated by narrative technique. In fact, the relationship between rabbinic theories and rabbinic actions is a complex one.76 Simon-Shoshan's reading of rabbinic stories may be understood in light of two models for understanding biblical legal narratives proposed by Bernard Jackson: the "constitutive" model, which focuses on the authority conferred upon the legal material by rooting it in its historico-narrative context,77 and the "semiotic" model, which understands the narrative context as helping to foster interpretation of the law by rooting it in a framework that helps to resolve questions and ambi guities.78 Simon-Shoshan understands rabbinic narratives in light of the division he draws between the "illustrative" details, which affect the validity and extent of the ruling, thus serving a "semiotic" function, and the "representational" (or "mimetic") details, which are not essential for understanding the ruling and there fore need to be understood in a "constitutive" way. However, I would suggest that the "semiotic" function of legal narrative may be understood in a broader fashion, thus conferring interpretive value on many details that Simon-Shoshan would term "representational" or "mimetic." The semiotic value of apparently superfluous narrative details may be understood in several ways: Elizabeth Shanks Alexander has shown how scholars described in the Talmud train budding halakhic scholars by presenting a series of cases designed to test the ability of the student to dis tinguish between relevant and irrelevant details.79 Hence, if we accept Alexander's thesis that many mishnahs are designed for pedagogic purposes, we may 75. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 160. 76. Ibid., 166. 77. See Jackson, Studies in the Semiotics of Biblical Law, 144-45. 78. In the work of Jeffrey Rubenstein, especially in his book, The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), one may find many instructive examples of how knowledge of the sitz im leben both of halakhic and of aggadic texts guides how one under stands and interprets them. Rubenstein is concerned with the stammaitic culture and with analyzing their values and social concerns, but his methods can readily be extended to tannaitic culture and to legal ramifications as well. 79. See Alexander, Transmitting Mishnah, 180-87. 285</page><page sequence="24">Avraham Walfish understand the presence of superfluous details in mishnaic narrative as helping to train the Mishnah student to weed out the irrelevant factors of the case. Martha Nussbaum has suggested that moral and legal thinking are best pro moted through the imaginative dramatization of dilemmas and their suggested res olutions.80 Hence, representational details may serve an important function in helping the student to enter fully into the narrative situation and to fathom its emotional and evaluative ramifications. Instructive examples of this kind of model may be found in the work of Barry Wimpfheimer, who sees profound human drama in subtle textual cues embedded in selected halakhic narratives in the Bavli. In Wimpfheimer's view, Where statements of legal reasoning aim to rationally justify positions of law in an imagined affectless world, legal narratives utilize surface and latent emotions to generate tone and nuance. A rabbinic ruling provides a black and white affirmative or negative reply while a legal narrative on the same topic allows for multiple characters and multiple actions that color the same issue in shades of grey.81 Many details in the Mishnah, including "representational" narrative details, may be understood as signaling the philosophical outlook and the values that underlie the Mishnah's system of law. These ideas may be ferreted out of the apparently superfluous details by using the "close reading" tools that I have applied to mish naic texts and/or the "cultural criticism" tools employed by Ishay Rosen-Zvi,82 and I suspect that scholars have only begun to deploy the spectrum of interpretive tools that may discover semiotic value in "representational" detail on a broad variety of levels. Choosing among the different models for understanding halakhic mishnaic narratives may also be related to the well-known debate among leading scholars of previous generations regarding the nature and purpose of Mishnah redaction. 80. See M. Nussbaum, Love's Knowledge (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), regard ing the importance of narrative in fostering moral thinking, and see idem, Poetic Justice (Boston: Beacon Press, 1995), regarding the role of narrative imagination as a thinking tool to shape legal thought. 81. B. Wimpfheimer, "Talmudic Legal Narrative: Broadening the Discourse of Jewish Law," Dine Israel 24 (2004): 159*. Wimpfheimer thus finds the use of narrative form in legal contexts as important both for humanizing the law and for producing more nuanced legal thought and interpret ation. See further idem, '"But It Is Not So': Towards a Poetics of Legal Narrative in the Talmud," Proof texts 24 (2004): 51-86 (my thanks to Steven Fraade for calling my attention to Wimpfheimer's work). Simon-Shoshan also notes that many of the details in rabbinic legal narratives may complicate the application of the ruling to other cases. However, whereas for Simon-Shoshan, the ambiguity ultimately boils down to the question of whether a ruling is or is not applicable, for Wimpfheimer?as for Nussbaum?narrative detail opens up richer vistas for construing the legal situation in subtler, imagi native, and innovative ways. 82. The tools of cultural criticism would also provide a different perspective on the reading of aggadic stories, as well as halakhic narratives. Earlier (see n. 78) I noted the work of Jeffrey Rubenstein, which also focuses on uncovering the sociocultural values reflected in rabbinic texts; however, Ruben stein's interpretive tools differ in significant ways from the tools of "cultural criticism." 286</page><page sequence="25">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative Jacob Epstein claimed that the Mishnah was designed as a legally binding codex, whereas Chanoch Albeck argued that the Mishnah was designed to help master and memorize the vast body of halakhic material rather than to serve as a collec tion of authoritative rulings.84 The models we have surveyed for understanding mishnaic narratives?and, in some cases, for understanding other mishnaic materials as well?may be similarly broken down into two schools of thought, which roughly correspond to the views of these two scholars. The "constitutive" model and the lowest tier of the "semiotic" model may be understood as a contem porary reworking of Epstein's approach, viewing the Mishnah as an attempt to guide and shape halakhic practice, albeit a more embattled and rhetorically soph isticated attempt than Epstein perceived. The other models, like Albeck, under stand Mishnah's purpose as shaping thought more than guiding practice, again augmenting this model with more sophisticated literary and cultural tools than those employed by Albeck. To illustrate the difference among the reading models suggested by the par ticipants in this symposium, let us examine the two stories in M. Sukkah 2:1: 1-A. He who sleeps under a bed in the sukkah has not fulfilled his obligation. 1-B. R. Judah stated, we were accustomed to sleep under a bed in the presence of the elders 1-C. R. Simeon said, it happened that Tevi, the slave of Rabban Gamliel, used to sleep under a bed. R. Gamliel said to the elders, "Do you see Tevi my slave, who is a student of scholars, and knows that slaves are exempt from [the law of] a sukkah, so he sleeps under the bed," and we learned by the way that he who sleeps under a bed has not fulfilled his obligation ... Simon-Shoshan focuses on the problematics of treating these narratives as "exempla."85 Rabbi Judah's first-person narration suggests a subjective narration colored by his own halakhic viewpoint, thus rendering his "exemplum" suspect, and the authority of the story is further impugned by the fact that Rabbi Judah was a disciple at the time of the story. If Rabbi Judah's behavior as a disciple was approved by his rabbis, then it may be taken as normative, but this point it is not firmly established by the story. The Tevi narrative, free of these suspicious features, presents a "more compelling case"; nevertheless, this narrative presents a "most curious exemplar." Despite Rabban Gamliel's praise for Tevi's knowledge, the slave Tevi is far removed socially from the rabbinic community, and yet his actions serve as an exemplum. Indeed, paradoxically, Tevi's action?sleeping under the bed in the sukkah?is exemplary precisely because, as a slave, he is 83. A modified version of this claim was argued by E. E. Urbach, who asserted that the Mishnah served as the foundation for all halakhic discussions, even if the ultimate ruling was not always in accord with the Mishnah. 84. Similarly, Abraham Goldberg argues that Mishnah is designed in accordance with edu cational principles. 85. Simon-Shoshan, "Halakhah lema'aseh," 205ff. 287</page><page sequence="26">Avraham Walfish exempt from sleeping in a sukkah. Thus ironically, Tevi's very exclusion from the community helps render his action exemplary and authoritative for that community. Reading the story in light of Rosen-Zvi's model of cultural criticism,86 we might pick up the discussion where Simon-Shoshan left off, examining how the ambivalent view of Rabban Gamliel's slave fits into the social philosophy of rab binic Judaism. While the slave is accorded a clear and unalterable status at the bottom of the social ladder, excluding him from important religious functions, nevertheless his knowledge and exemplary behavior can earn him a religious persona and even a position of honor within the society. Elizabeth Shanks Alexander's performative model would likely focus on the paradoxical nature of Rabban Gamliel's evaluation of Tevi's behavior. Knowing the standard ruling that it is forbidden to sleep under the bed in a sukkah, one might have expected Rabban Gamliel to chastise Tevi for failing to follow the halakhah. Rabban Gamliel confounds this expectation by noting a further feature of the case at hand, namely Tevi's exemption from the mitzvah, a feature that might have eluded the notice of the Mishnah student. Thus, this nar rative serves as an excellent pedagogic exercise for sharpening the student's halakhic reasoning. Utilizing my own close-reading techniques, I would call attention to the reappearance of both the bed and the slave in the last two pericopes of the chapter, M. Sukkah 2:8-9:87 8-C. It happened that Shammai the Elder's daughter-in-law gave birth and he cut through the plaster and put sekhakh over the bed because of the child ... 9-B. If rains fall, from when is permitted to vacate [the sukkah]? From when the broth spoils. 9-C. They employ a parable?to what is this similar? To a slave who comes to mix [water with the master's wine] and he spills the pitcher [of water] on his face The echoing at the end of the chapter of these key motifs from the beginning of the chapter constitutes a literary inclusio, which focuses the reader's attention on a paradoxical fact: Whereas real-life slaves are actually exempted from the mitzvah of sukkah, the metaphor of a slave is precisely the metaphor selected by the Mishnah to describe the adult Jewish male who does perform this mitzvah. Moreover, the realis story of Mishnah 1 and the parable of Mishnah 9 86. I have not included Beth Berkowitz and Chaya Halberstam in my survey of different ways of reading this story because I believe that their methods would tend to focus either on issues of auth ority or on issues of social stratification?or quite possibly on both. As Judith Hauptman noted in her lecture at the conference, her own work is focused on a completely different issue, the relationship between Mishnah and Tosefta; hence, her work does not present an independent model for reading mis hnaic narratives. 87. I have discussed the mishnahs at the end of the chapter, and the meaning of their literary connection to the mishnah at the beginning of the chapter in my article, "Hasukkah umeshal ha'eved: hahidah shebapesher" (in preparation). 288</page><page sequence="27">The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative are mirror images of one another: In M. 1, Tevi's failure to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah earns the praise of his master, whereas the fulfillment of sukkah in Mishnah 9 elicits a contemptuously angry response from the divine master. The wordplays that frame the chapter suggest that the mitzvah of sukkah involves a sophisticated notion of servitude, bound up with a dialectical conception of how service of God and service of man may interact. VI. Conclusion This example will serve to illustrate that the different reading models suggested by contemporary scholars need not exclude one another. The methods of each of the participants in this symposium may be reexamined and refined in light of the alternative reading methods proposed by the other panelists. Despite the different questions and methodologies that we have applied to the Mishnah, I believe that all the approaches presented here share certain features that, to my mind, mark a new trend in Mishnah research. While not ignoring the classical philological issues of lower and higher criticism, these studies have directed their attention to the text itself, focusing on aspects of the style, language, and format of the text as it stands that have hitherto been neglected. All these studies contribute, therefore, not only to explaining how the text came to be but also?to use Dilthey's term?to verstehen, to understanding the meanings con veyed by the text. Simon-Shoshan has made his contribution to this discussion by highlighting the role of narrative qualities in the mishnaic text and by analyzing the ways in which mishnaic stories present and texture rabbinic authority. Through synchronie analysis of the ways in which the Mishnah deploys forms of varying degrees of "narrativity," Simon-Shoshan has demonstrated, pace Neusner, its complex multifaceted and multivocal nature. Simon-Shoshan's largely halakho centric readings of fully developed narratives, aggadic as well as halakhic, high light issues of rabbinic authority, which, in his view, the stories tend to affirm when read "with the grain," while questioning it when read "against the grain." Simon-Shoshan has proposed highly developed tools for perceiving and analyzing the dialectic between the different needs and aspects of the Mishnah's halakhic system. In many cases, these tools provide important insights into the complexities of halakhic authority, although in other cases, I have argued that other issues and other aspects of the halakhic system should be regarded as more central. In his more recent work, Simon-Shoshan has refined his thinking on how to understand "representational/mimetic" narrative details, and I believe his thinking on this matter may be fruitfully combined with insights by several of the other scholars represented in this symposium.
