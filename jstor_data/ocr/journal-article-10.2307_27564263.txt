Fackenheim's Last Philosophical Testament by Benjamin Pollock Nietzsche's madman is mad, then, because he comes both too late and too soon: too late to have a god for company; too soon to be able to bear the new solitude.1 Emil Fackenheim's philosophical response to the Holocaust is permeated by the worry that Auschwitz marks a rupture so severe that it compels any attempt to philosophize in its wake either to ignore the magnitude of this rupture or to lose itself in radical nihilism. "Perhaps no thought can exist in the same space as the Holocaust," Fackenheim writes in To Mend the World. "Perhaps all thought, to assure its own survival, must be elsewhere."2 In the writings that culminate in To Mend the World, a single realization may be said to save Fackenheim from post-Holocaust philosophical and spiritual despair. Contemporary thought would indeed remain incapacitated by the Holo caust, the "sphere of thought would stay paralyzed," Fackenheim tells us, "were it not for the astounding fact that the very sphere of life that does the paralyzing also gives the basis for a mending. For if the wonder in which philosophy originates is turned into paralyzing horror by the 'humanly impossible' crime of the criminals, its paralysis is mended by the wonder at the victims who resisted a crime to which resistance itself was 'humanly impossible.'"3 The possibility of an authentic response to the Holocaust in post-Holocaust thinking thus depends, in Fackenheim's account, on the actual response of those An earlier version of this article was presented as the Ray D. Wolfe Memorial Lecture in Jewish Studies at the University of Toronto in January, 2005.1 would like to thank those who participated in the discussion after the lecture for their comments and suggestions. I would especially like to acknowledge the anonymous reader from A JS Review whose sharp comments challenged me to spell out a number of points in my interpretation that would have remained vague or underdeveloped otherwise. 1.

Without the resisting victims of the Holocaust as our teachers and guides, we would remain forever frozen in our "metaphysical paralysis" before Auschwitz. This is why, Fackenheim declares, for philosophy after the Holocaust, "the going-to-school of thought with this life is not a tempor ary necessity but permanent."6 "Thought going to school with life" thus becomes a slogan for the most "permanent" of Fackenheim's methodological commitments, for it is Fackenheim's explicit conviction that such schooling alone makes possible a thinking and a living, fragmentary as they may be, in this our post-Holocaust moment in history.7 But there is now reason to suspect that in the last years of his life, Facken heim changed his mind decisively regarding this most basic tenet of his philoso phical response to the Holocaust, and thus regarding the path he believed philosophy and religious thought must take in order to come to grips with the Holocaust in its truth. This reason comes in the form of a note Fackenheim left for us to ponder in his own personal copy of To Mend the World. I discovered this note on the day of Fackenheim's funeral, September 21, 2003, during a visit to his Jerusalem apart ment after his burial. Fackenheim's personal copies of his own books had been set out on a coffee table in the middle of the apartment, and in the course of that afternoon, I picked up his copy of To Mend the World (2nd ed., 1989) and began thumbing through it. My attention was caught by a handwritten 3x5 note card clipped between page 200 and page 201 of the book, the very spot where Fackenheim begins his analysis of that "resistance" in life that serves to make possible post-Holocaust thought by the book's end. 4. Cf. Michael L. Morgan, "Fackenheim and the Holocaust: Setting the Record Straight," Yad Vashem Studies 32 (2004): 16: "Fackenheim came to this answer to his central question: it is possible for us to resist Nazi purposes now, because resistance was actual then in a way that it understood itself as the victim of radical evil and yet as acts of resistance against it." 5. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 15. 6. Ibid., 28. 7. Noting how the motto "thought going to school with life" links To Mend the World with some of Fackenheim's earliest writings on the Holocaust, Michael Morgan points out that the specific form of "life" that teaches thought is reconceived over time. "In the works of the late sixties," Morgan notes, "the 'life' that educates thought is the commitment to Jewish survival of post-Holocaust Jews, and what it teaches is the existence and content of an imperative to go on, to oppose Nazi purposes. In To Mend the World... the 'life' is that of the resisting victims, and what it teaches is that there is an imperative or duty and that the imperative can be heeded, that Jewish life after Auschwitz is not only necessary, it is also possible."

Right there, where the book's "going-to-school-with-life...begins in earnest,"8 Fackenheim had attached the following note: I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND OR MAYBE IT IS TOO LATE AND TOO EARLY LIFE CANNOT NOW BE WITH IT, BUT THOUGHT CAN + MUST.9 The scene is worth painting in all its color: Fackenheim had been buried less than an hour before, and it is hard not to picture him laughing even at that very moment, terribly pleased at the monumental quandary he had posed with this note to all those who take his thought seriously. In this scribbled note, Fackenheim seems to have undermined completely the foundations of his own philosophical response to the Holocaust. For this note does not reflect a change of mind on some small 8. See Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 23, where the author directs the reader explicitly to the shift in the book on pp. 200-201. 9.

"Life"?that living resistance during the Holocaust that alone was to make possible a fragmentary mending of life and thought after the Holocaust?"now cannot be with" the Holocaust; "thought," on the other hand, "can and must." What are we to make of this remarkable, eleventh-hour reversal of Fackenheim's philosophical position?if it is indeed the reversal it seems to be? What does Fackenheim intend by such a reconsideration of the core idea of his post-Holocaust thinking? Does he intend with this note to undermine what he had long considered to be the sole possibility for an intellectually honest life after the Holocaust, one that neither ignores the event nor loses itself in it? Does the note express a kind of despair over the power of life to respond to the evils of the Holocaust without either denying the extremity of that evil or falling into a radical nihilism? Does it express Fackenheim's growing sense, in his last years, that the world is no longer quite as interested in facing the absolute, unprecedented evil that Fackenheim perceived in the Holocaust? Or does it, to the contrary, express newfound faith in a hitherto untapped power of thought to confront the Holocaust whole of horror? In the coming pages, I will try to address these questions through an interpretation of the note card Fackenheim clipped into his personal copy of To Mend the World. I will first suggest that a concern with the question of the relation ship between thought and life pervades Fackenheim's thought from his earliest work on Hegel up through what we might designate, with a touch of drama, as this his last philosophical testament. Second, I will claim that with this announced "change of mind," Fackenheim is reenacting?perhaps intentionally?a late change in Hegel's thought to which Fackenheim himself often pointed. After setting up this Hegelian background, I will present the evidence for what appear to me to be two plausible interpretations of the content of the note card. On one hand, I will show that there are surprising precedents for Fackenheim's announced change of mind already in To Mend the World. These precedents suggest that the note card's apparently radical reversal of Fackenheim's long-held philosophical position may instead be a late recognition on Fackenheim's part of what are, in fact, long-standing tensions in his thought: tensions between competing assess ments of the possibilities inherent in his post-Holocaust historical moment, and tensions between two very different notions of resistance. I will then proceed to examine the evidence suggesting that this note card does indeed stem from Fackenheim's last years and that it does amount to the radical change of mind it claims to be. Both interpretations of the note card, I will argue, shed unexpected light on both Fackenheim's own post-Holocaust philosophical project and on the possibility of post-Holocaust thought and life as a whole. * * * Fackenheim's own philosophical preoccupation with the relationship between thought and life can be traced to his early work on Hegel. Indeed, his The Religious Dimension in Hegel's Thought declares "the problem of the relation 136</page><page sequence="5">Thought Going to School with Life? between all of human life and an all-comprehensive philosophical thought" to be "the central problem of the whole Hegelian philosophy."10 If ancient philosophers conceived of truth as transcendent to the contingent world in which they lived, if they could only "rise" to the realm of truth "by means of a flight from the contin gent world," Hegel's uniqueness as a thinker, according to Fackenheim, lay in the way he sought to grasp truth as an absolute that is both identical to itself and at once manifest in all the manifold differences of "multicolored life."11 As Fackenheim consistently notes, Hegel believed himself capable of grasp ing truth and life in their full systematic identity and difference only because "the times [we]re ripe for it," because historical life had finally advanced to a point at which complete knowledge was possible.12 Fackenheim understands Hegel's much-maligned claim regarding the "actuality of the rational and the rationality of the actual" to mean, first, that the very ideals of reason and freedom, promoted by and preserved in philosophy since ancient Greece, had attained their living actua lization as a result of the movement of history from the founding of Christianity to the French Revolution in Hegel's time. Only this historical actualization of reason in Hegel's own time, Fackenheim explains, enabled Hegel to demonstrate the ration ality of the actual, and thereby the unity of thought and life, in his system.13 It was Hegel's insistence that his own systematic grasp of truth was grounded in the fact that the times were ripe for such a grasp of truth that led Fackenheim to conclude that had Hegel lived in our time, had he lived after Auschwitz rather than before it, he would have been unable to ignore the radical rupture of real life that Auschwitz was, with the result?according to Fackenheim?that Hegel would have been forced to recognize that the fragmenta tion of reality after the Holocaust permits of no universal mediation, no systematic unification. "Such are the crises that have befallen" us in the last half century, Fackenheim asserts, "that it may safely be said that, were he alive today, so realis tic a philosopher as Hegel would not be Hegelian."14 Fackenheim boldly repeated this claim throughout his intellectual career: that Hegel would not be a Hegelian were he alive today; that he (Fackenheim) could "imagine Hegel only as radically self-exposed to the 10.

Louis Greenspan and Graeme Nicholson (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992), 47^18: "It should also be apparent that this relationship between life and thought is the central category in Fackenheim's own thought. It is one reason why he must be called a Hegelian." 11. Fackenheim, The Religious Dimension in Hegel's Thought, 11, 28. 12. Ibid., 33, 224. Cf. G. W. F.

He did not choose fide lity to the actual world over the purity of philosophical thought. Fackenheim notes, time and again, that when faced with the selfishness, the decadence, and the divi siveness he witnessed around him in the last decade of his life, Hegel came to the uncharacteristic conclusion that "philosophic thought has no choice but to become a 'separate sanctuary,' inhabited by philosophers, an 'isolated order of priests' [who] cannot mix with the world, but must leave to the world the task of settling how it might find its way out of its present state of disruption."17 Hegel's late phi losophical rejection of actual life, so uncharacteristic of his systematic corpus, never ceased to perplex Fackenheim. "What an incredible, what a shattering turn of thought!"18 he writes. "If anything runs counter to Hegel's entire thought, it is precisely a flight by his modern thought from the modem world."19 "Such a resort to flight would be tantamount to radical failure."20 "[Hegel's] thought stakes all on its ability to stay with the modem world. Thus Hegel's final doubts have implications catastrophic for his philosophy as a whole."21 Fackenheim's perplexity over Hegel's "final doubts" provides us, I think, with the proper backdrop against which to view Fackenheim's own scribbled reversal of the core idea of To Mend the World. We find in the note card Fackenheim left us a curious reenactment of Hegel's own late reconsideration of his systematic achievements. Hegel appends to his systematic synthesis of life and thought reflections that appear to undermine that synthesis, that turn away from the fragmentation of life in order to preserve the purity of thought. Likewise, Fackenheim appends to his long-standing commitment to ground the possibility of post-Holocaust thinking in Holocaust and post-Holocaust life reflec tions that give up on that life in whose school thought is supposed to leam, reflec tions that convey a loss of faith in the ability of real life in our time to respond to the Holocaust in any meaningfully sufficient way?reflections that assert the sphere of thought alone as a "separate sanctuary," if you will, in which the 15.

Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 119. 138</page><page sequence="7">Thought Going to School with Life? Holocaust may be confronted. Or rather, Fackenheim offers us a strange mirror inversion of Hegel's "final doubts." For in Fackenheim's case, it is not the purity of truth in thought that must go into hiding in "a separate philosophical sanctuary" so that it can be protected from the discord of reality; rather, it is the horror of Auschwitz, the radical evil of the Holocaust world that must be pre served, eerily, in its purity in thought, sealed away hermetically, as it were, until life has reached a moment when it can confront that evil without either losing itself in it or reducing that evil to something banal. And just as Fackenheim saw in Hegel's "final doubts" about the amenability of a fragmented reality to his own absolute knowledge "implications catastrophic for his philosophy as a whole," "tantamount to [the] radical failure" of Hegel's system, it appears that Fackenheim's own "final doubts" are meant to drive us to consider whether Fackenheim's whole philosophical quest to confront the Holocaust might not have ended in a confession of failure. Or, to put it another way, Fackenheim's radical reversal of philosophical position expressed in these "late doubts" seems almost orchestrated to beg us to ask the question: Would Fackenheim be a Fackenheimian if he were alive today? * * * When Fackenheim claimed that Hegel would no longer be a Hegelian today, we may recall, he based his claim on an evaluation of his own historical moment: Hegel attained his systematic grasp of truth because the times were ripe for such knowledge; but after the Holocaust, "the historical conditions producing the actuality of the rational (and hence the rationality of the actual)" have "pass[ed] away."2 Thus, it is not surprising to find that when Fackenheim expresses a change of mind in the note card before us regarding his own long-held philosophical position, this change of mind is accompanied by a question regarding the character of the historical moment at hand: "I have changed my mind or maybe it is too late and too early." At least preliminarily, I think we can read this comment as expressing the following doubt: Perhaps the times are not ripe for a philosophical response to the Holocaust, or?more specifically?perhaps the times are not ripe for a philo sophical response to the Holocaust in which thought goes to school with life. Perhaps it is both "too late and too early" for such schooling. Before we ask what Fackenheim might mean by designating our times as "too late and too early" for thought to go to school with life, it is worth emphasiz ing that Fackenheim's long-standing commitment to sending his own thought to school with life is itself grounded in historical considerations. Fackenheim high lights this historical character of his approach explicitly in To Mend the World. Here, Fackenheim notes that the question, "How does thought stand related to life, and life to thought?" has received different answers from the key thinkers of modern times. Thus, "Hegel affirms that thought can come only after life, and can only comprehend what already is," whereas "Marx, Nietzsche, and 22. Fackenheim, "On the Actuality of the Rational and the Rationality of the Actual," 698. 139</page><page sequence="8">Benjamin Pollock Heidegger...all affirm that thought in some ways precedes and even helps shape forms of life." Presenting his own response to the question, Fackenheim continues: "For our part.. .we find it impossible to furnish the question with an unequivocal, sweeping, and definitive answer. However, if it is indeed the case that Jewish life in our time is in advance of thought, then it is clearly necessary for Jewish thought (and not for it alone) to go to school with life."23 Although Fackenheim indeed proceeds to announce his conclusion that "Jewish life is in advance of Jewish thought"24?hence, a "going-to-school with-life" is now of the utmost urgency?his considerations regarding the question of the relation between thought and life are telling. Fackenheim does not commit to "thought going to school with life" as "an unequivocal, sweeping, and definite" rule that philosophers must adopt at all times, but rather, such a philosophical approach to confronting the Holocaust is only called for, we see, if and insofar as "it is indeed the case that Jewish life in our time is in advance of thought." Historically inflected, Fackenheim's question regarding the relation between thought and life becomes the following: What is demanded of thought and what is possible for thought after the Holocaust?that is, what must thought do and what can thought do?given that life during the Holocaust and life in our historical moment after the Holocaust are of such-and-such a character? Fackenheim's answer, his philosophical commitment to a schooling with life, is grounded?from the 614th Commandment through To Mend the World?in his assessment that his own times are ripe for such a schooling because "life in our time is in advance of thought."25 But what if the times are not ripe for such a philosophical approach to the Holocaust? It is significant that even in To Mend the World, in which Fackenheim asserts his methodological commitments in the strongest and most precise of terms?"the going-to-school of thought with this life is not a temporary necessity but permanent"26?he at once expresses concerns about whether he has indeed read the landscape of his post-Holocaust moment rightly. "One glance at contemporary thought suffices to show that the necessary schooling has hardly begun," Fackenheim writes. "And the tme question before us is whether a present attempt on our part, not to think future Jewish thought but merely to give foundations for it, does not, like Nietzsche's madman of a century ago, come too soon."27 I find it significant that Fackenheim's observation in this passage?that con temporary thinkers have not yet heeded the call to go to school with life?does not simply lead him to call more loudly for such schooling; rather, it leads him to ques tion whether, in fact, it might not be "too soon" for any philosophical response to the Holocaust. Moreover, his allusion to Nietzsche's madman in this context offers 23. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 14-15. Cf. p. 201. 24. Ibid. 25. Cf. Fackenheim, God's Presence in History, 85: "I am able to make the above, fragmentary statement [re: the Commanding Voice of Auschwitz] ... only because it no more than articulates what is being heard by Jews the world over?rich and poor, learned and ignorant, believing and secularist." See also n. 7 herein. 26. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 28. 27. Ibid., 29. 140</page><page sequence="9">Thought Going to School with Life? us a glimpse into what Fackenheim had in mind in designating a given historical moment not merely as "too soon" but as both "too late and too early." In Nietzsche's parable, the madman who comes to the marketplace speaking of the death of God ends up throwing down his lantern in frustration when he rea lizes that those in the marketplace do not understand him. "I come too early.. .1 am not yet on time," Nietzsche has the madman say. "This tremendous event is still on the way and wanders; it has not yet reached the ears of men;... deeds need time, even after they are done, to be seen and heard."28 Reflecting on the timing of his own arrival, then, Nietzsche's madman struggles to express the limbo status of his moment. He has arrived after the occur rence of an event?the death of God?that changes everything. The deed is already done, and it is too late for humanity to live or think as if the event did not occur. On the other hand, even though it is already done, this deed "still needs time...to be seen and heard," it is "still on the way," it "has not yet reached the ears of men." As such, the madman comes too soon: For because the death of God has not yet been grasped as what it is, no response to this new reality is yet possible. Moreover, until such a response is actual, there remains the possibility that this event will never be grasped for what it is?that the madman will remain alone among all beings in knowing what he knows. Commenting on Nietzsche's parable in God's Presence in History, Fackenheim writes, "Nietzsche's madman is mad, then, because he comes both too late and too soon: too late to have a god for company; too soon to be able to bear the new solitude."29 Moreover, after he alludes to Nietzsche's madman in the context of questioning the timeliness or untimeliness of his own endeavor in To Mend the World, Fackenheim proceeds to apply the two-sided temporal quandary faced by the madman to his own post-Holocaust moment. On the one hand, Fackenheim notes, there are "compelling precedents" in Jewish history to suggest that in the wake of historical catastrophes?for example, the destruction of the temple, the expulsion from Spain?Jewish theological response has come only long after the events themselves. Or, in the terms of the madman: "[D]eeds need time, even after they are done, to be seen and heard." "Should there not be, then," Fackenheim proceeds to ask, "a philosophical and theological morator ium on this subject, perhaps for centuries to come?"30 On the other hand, Fackenheim worries that given the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors still alive to testify to what they experienced, the window of time in which confronting the Holocaust would be possible might have already passed by?for without these eyewitnesses, how will others believe that such an inconceivable event truly occurred? 28.

Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 29. 141</page><page sequence="10">Benjamin Pollock The earlier catastrophes were great but not beyond belief, and thus lived on in the memory of the generations until the time was ripe for a response. Our cat astrophe, in contrast, is beyond belief and becomes ever more so with the passage of time.... As these words are being written, the survivors are plan ning a worldwide conference in Jerusalem, in a last and desperate attempt to communicate their incommunicable truth.... Their attempt is the last: in view of their ever-diminishing number, after this conference there will be none other.31 If historical precedents suggest that Jewish thought needs more time before it can confront what happened in the Holocaust, the particular fallout of this particular catastrophe suggests quite the contrary. Given the unbelievable, "incommunicable" tmth of what happened to the victims at Auschwitz, and given the diminishing number of survivors, Fackenheim implies, it may, in fact, already be too late for us to grasp the tmth regarding the Holocaust and to respond to it. Thus, we find, already in To Mend the World, that Fackenheim considers the possibility that the contemporary historical moment may not be ripe for a philoso phical schooling with life?that it may be "too late and too early" to enable the required response to the Holocaust. Despite his announced conclusion that "Jewish life is in advance of Jewish thought," Fackenheim?like the madman pro phesying in the wake of the death of God?does not yet know^or certain whether the response demanded by the radical event he seeks to confront might be yet to come or whether it might never come at all. The verdict is still out, we might say, on whether the Holocaust will ever be grasped in its tmth or whether it will instead fade out of human consciousness with the passing of time, whether the only opportunity for it to be grasped and confronted as it is has long passed. In the introduction to To Mend the World, this possibility that the contempor ary historical moment might not be ripe for a schooling with life leads Fackenheim to a conclusion that?remarkably?opposes quite blatantly the very "going-to school-with-life" methodology to which Fackenheim commits the book as a whole. If, in fact, life does not or does no longer or does not yet make post-Holo caust thought possible, Fackenheim proceeds to assert, then "thought cannot wait for a ripeness of time that may never arrive. Rather than hope for a wisdom that comes only after a day of life is done, it is gripped by the necessity to announce and help produce a new day while there is yet night."32 Fackenheim's conclusion here is remarkable given the call for thought to go to school with life that Fackenheim himself?only a single page earlier!?insists guides To Mend the World. It shows us that what appears in the scribbled note card to be a late change of mind might very well reflect an ambivalence in Fackenheim's thought that is present already in To Mend the World. For immedi ately after his call for thought to go to school with life, Fackenheim suggests that it may, in fact, be the case that thought "cannot wait for a ripeness of time" that would come "only after a day of life is done." The times may be ripe for a 31. Ibid. 32. Ibid., 29-30. 142</page><page sequence="11">Thought Going to School with Life? philosophical response to the Holocaust in which thought goes to school with life; but it may just as well be the case that it is both too early?in the light of historical precedents?and too late?given the magnitude of the rupture of the Holocaust and the diminishing number of witnesses to it?to trust such a response. Fackenheim's ambivalence here with regard to the question of what philosophy can and must do after the Holocaust is the product of his ambivalence between two competing assessments of his historical moment. Has the living response to the evil of the Holocaust, both at Auschwitz and in its wake, made the times ripe for thought to go to school with life? Or is it both too soon and too late for an authentic response to the Holocaust in life and thought? I suggest that we view this ambivalence not as some sloppiness over prin ciples on Fackenheim's part but rather as an example of what happens when a philosopher is confronted by a question that remains bigger than the answer he or she gives to it. Fackenheim cannot shake the question of whether Jewish philosophy can indeed do what he is convinced it is called upon to do after the Holocaust. Early on in his thinking, he reaches the conclusion that the living responses to the Holocaust that have been actual make philosophy possible after Auschwitz, and his announced allegiance to "thought going to school with life" in To Mend the World offers his most refined formulation of this answer. But even as Fackenheim stays committed to and even sharpens this answer, he remains plagued by the question itself: Does "thought going to school with life" really offer an answer so satisfying that it puts an end to all doubts and uncertainty regarding the possibility of post-Holocaust philosophy? With so much riding on his own assessment of his historical moment, it is not surprising that Fackenheim's very seriousness as a thinker led him to question his own conclusions and to consider the very real possibility that the times were not ripe for thought to go to school with life after the Holocaust; that it remained, paradoxically, both "too late and too early" for "life"?and hence any thought that would model itself on life?to "be with it." If this line of thinking indeed resembles the line of thinking that led Fackenheim to write his change of mind on the note card, then perhaps we may claim that what the note card displays is the fact that the philosophical question Fackenheim asked in view of the Holocaust remained more consistent, more unchanging, more "permanently" before him than any answer he was able to give to it. * * * In a situation in which thought cannot wait for a ripeness of living time, we see Fackenheim suggest, thought "is gripped by the necessity to announce and help produce a new day while there is yet night." But when it comes to answering the question of how thought can, in fact, help produce such a new day when life is not yet prepared to guide it, the rest of To Mend the World seems to fall right back into the answer in question: Thought can resist the Holocaust today only because life did so during the Holocaust! That is to say, though Fackenheim is aware that "thought going to school with life" may not exhaust all doubts regarding the possi bility of post-Holocaust philosophy, that it may not be able to shirk the fear that the times are not ripe for such a response, To Mend the World only holds together as a 143</page><page sequence="12">Benjamin Pollock whole insofar as it remains committed to a thinking that is schooled before life. Thus, despite conceding his own doubts in the introduction to To Mend the World, Fackenheim never ceased to highlight this schooling of thought with life as the core teaching of the book. For example, in his reflections on "The Devel opment of My Thought" in 1987, he points to "the critical turn upon which To Mend the World as a whole revolves," a turn that occurs when "thought, shattered by the Holocaust, finds no way out except to rely on life, or more precisely, the life that was resistance-to-the-Holocaust-assault during the Holocaust itself"33 In "A Reply to My Critics: A Testament of Thought," published in the tribute volume Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought (1992), Fackenheim simi larly praises Michael Morgan for identifying the '"heart of hearts' of the work [To Mend the World]: the 'rupture' and 'mending' in Holocaust life, on which the 'mending' of both Jewish and philosophical post-Holocaust thought entirely depends."34 Even as late as 2002, a year before his death, Fackenheim opened a lecture at Yad Vashem by saying, "Sometimes life goes to school with philosophy, sometimes philosophy to school with life: after the Holocaust, the latter was the case, could not be otherwise."35 Now, we have indeed recognized that there is considerably more ambiguity in Fackenheim's position than he himself might have conceded. Nevertheless, in light of Fackenheim's continued allegiance to a thinking schooled before life, what is so curious about Fackenheim's scribbled note card is not simply that Fackenheim denies therein the very power of life on which post-Holocaust thought seemed to depend in To Mend the World, but that Fackenheim attributes in this note a contrary power to thought. To thought is now attributed the ability ?and hence the vocation?to "be with" the Holocaust directly. The problem is that without the mediation of life, without the mediation of the living resistance of the victims of the Holocaust at whose feet Fackenheim "goes to school" in To Mend the World, it is entirely unclear how thought could ever grasp or even confront the Holocaust directly, given Fackenheim's own philosophical premises. I would like to suggest that here, too, the little note card Fackenheim left us actually makes visible another, even more intriguing ambivalence in Fackenheim's philosophical position in To Mend the World, one regarding the key category of "resistance." I want to claim that there are, in fact, two rival notions of resistance that Fackenheim presents in the heart of To Mend the World, two notions between which Fackenheim wavers indecisively in the book. On one hand, resistance is grasped as the Holocaust victims' unprecedented, wonder-inspiring way of living or being, the novum whereby "our going-to-school-with-life begins in earnest." Explaining this notion of resistance, Fackenheim writes, [I]n extremity?when the Nazi logic of destruction had become the Final Sol ution?Kiddush Hahayyim [sanctification of life] revealed itself as a unique 33.

For [those] Jews (and honorary Jews) caught by the full force of the Nazi logic of destruction, resistance was a way of being. According to this account of resistance, it is solely insofar as the resistance of the Holocaust victims amounts to an unprecedented way of being or living that a post-Holocaust philosophy that goes to school with that way of living becomes possible.37 Thought may indeed be paralyzed by the Holocaust; but it is jump started, Fackenheim suggests, by the wonder we experience before the fact of living resistance. For "thought," Fackenheim tells us, "if it grasps but a single instance of such resistance, and of but the most prosaic sort, has no choice but to be radically, permanently astonished."38 It is this notion of resistance, the victims' unprecedented way of living or being, I want to suggest, that Fackenheim's note brings into question, that Fackenheim himself undermines when he says he has "changed [his] mind," that "life cannot now be with it." If this conception of resist ance as a way of being or living were Fackenheim's last word on the subject in To Mend the World, then we would be compelled to conclude that the note card before us does indeed reveal an unprecedented reversal in Fackenheim's thought. But I'd like to propose that in Chapter IV, Part 8 of To Mend the World, Fackenheim juxtaposes against this notion of resistance as a form of life or being another, very different conception of resistance. What was it, Fackenheim asks himself at a crucial point in his discussion, that allowed those Holocaust victims who lived out a form of resistance to resist as they did? According to Fackenheim, the answer lies in the fact that some of those "ordinary men and women confronted and grasped this whole-of horror even while they were in it and trapped by it... .without this confronting grasp, they could not have done what in fact they did."39 Here, suddenly, without warning, we find the relationship between life and thought has been reversed in Fackenheim's account. Now we are told that it is not life or being that resists Nazi evil out of its own power, to be imi tated by any thought that wishes to be authentic after Auschwitz. On the contrary, resistance, in this and similar passages, first takes the form of thought or 36. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 223-24 (I have supplied the boldface, but the italicized portions appear in the published text). 37. Cf. Nicholson, "The Passing of Hegel's Germany," 48: "Still more noteworthy in Facken heim's own thought?that has to go to school with life?is that a Jew today, or a philosopher today, is able to draw near in thought to the Holocaust only because of the religious witness borne there, in life and in death, of those who suffered." 38. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 201. Cf. Reiner Munk, "Revelation and Resistance: A Reflection on the Thought of Emil L. Fackenheim," in Greenspan and Nicholson, Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought, 232: "Even though there were only a few individuals who offered this resistance, and even though it was possible only for a short time, it shows that life, in contrast to philosophy, was not wholly 'paralysed' by the Sho 'ah. According to Fackenheim, the impli cation for modern thought is that it must become the apprentice of life: 'Thought has to go to school with life.'" 39. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 218. 145</page><page sequence="14">Benjamin Pollock knowledge, and only afterward does this resisting thought make possible a resist ing life.40 Without their grasp of the Holocaust "whole-of-horrors," those who resisted could not have done what they did! Fackenheim's claims about "thought going to school with life" notwithstanding, it is this resisting thought that took place during the Holocaust and not the brave resistance of the victims in life, according to these passages, that makes post-Holocaust philosophy poss ible today. Thus, Fackenheim writes, "Authentic thought was actual during the Holocaust among the resisting victims; therefore such thought must be possible for us after the event: and being possible it is mandatory."41 We find, then, in crucial passages in To Mend the World, a surprising renun ciation of the very motto that is meant to guide that work, that is, "thought going to school with life." Our thought must go to school, in a sense, where it has always gone to school?with thought; only this time, the thought is not the thought of an armchair philosopher but of the philosophizing victim of Nazi horror. I think that reading "resistance" in To Mend the World primarily as a cat egory of thinking rather than of living opens up some interesting possibilities for interpreting Fackenheim's post-Holocaust philosophical project as a whole. Because now, the resistance on the part of the Holocaust victims is not grasped as some demonstration of the fact that, when cmshed in unprecedented fashion, human life resists in unprecedented fashion. Instead, Fackenheim may be said to have inherited a resisting form of thought from those Holocaust victims who themselves thought resistance. Post-Holocaust philosophy is possible for Fackenheim, according to this reading, not because of resistance in life but because of resistance in thought. Post-Holocaust philosophy is possible not because of some remarkable will to live that still managed to manifest itself in the death camps but because philos ophy?a new kind of philosophy?was bom there. In this vein, Fackenheim writes, "The evil of the Holocaust world is philosophically intelligible after Auschwitz, only in the exact sense in which it was already understood in Auschwitz by the resisting victims themselves....No deeper or more ultimate grasp is possible for philosophical thought that comes after the event. This grasp is epistemologically ultimate."42 Such passages suggest, once again, that the change of mind the note card reports, to the effect that now "thought can and must" confront the Holocaust directly, may, in fact, reflect a conception of Holocaust thinking already introduced in To Mend the World: The thought that can and must be with the Holocaust may be none other than the "epistemologically ultimate" grasp that 40. Michael Morgan certainly recognizes the way in which Fackenheim conceives of resistance as a form of thinking that is already performed by the Holocaust victims themselves when he writes, "Our thinking of the event can be authentic because their's was, and our resistance is both mandatory and possible because their resistance was actual" ("The Central Problem of To Mend the World," 309). But Morgan does not ask how such a resisting thought on the part of the victims is to be reconciled with Fackenheim's claim that thought must go to school with life. 41. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 249. 42. Ibid., 247. 146</page><page sequence="15">Thought Going to School with Life? the resisting victims attained during the event itself. If this is the notion of post Holocaust thought to which the note card points, we may well ask what this epis temologically ultimate grasp of Auschwitz was. What exactly is this grasp of the Holocaust that is possible for us today only in the exact sense in which it was manifest as a way of thinking or knowing among the resisting victims them selves? Fackenheim gives us some guidelines for thinking about such resistance thinking in To Mend the World, where he defines such resistance in thought in the following manner: The Holocaust whole-of-horrors is (for it has been); but it ought not to be (and not to have been), but it is (for it has been). Thought would lapse into escapism if it held fast to the 'ought not' alone; and it would lapse into paralyzed impotence if it confronted, nakedly, the devastating 'is' alone. Only by holding fast at once to the 'is' and the 'ought not' can thought achieve an authentic survival. Thought, that is, must take the form of resistance.43 Here, Fackenheim defines what he means by "resisting thinking" quite precisely: It is thinking that ignores neither the reality of the Holocaust?the fact that what was inconceivable really happened?nor the truth that what happened during the Holocaust was "radically evil." To ignore either one, Fackenheim suggests, would be untruthful and unphilosophical. Resisting thinking offers a philosophically authentic way of grasping the Holocaust insofar as it "holds fast at once to the 'is' and the 'ought not'" of the Holocaust, to the fact that it was but ought not to have been.44 In defining resisting thinking as a thought that thinks the "is" and the "ought not" of the Holocaust together, Fackenheim is relating and opposing his post Holocaust resistance thinking, once again, to the philosophy of Hegel. For one way of formulating the Hegelian motto that we examined earlier?"what is rational is actual, and what is actual is rational"?is to say that in Hegel's estimation, history has realized the "ought" in the "is." The realization of reason and freedom through history has brought together the ideals of reason and freedom that "ought to be" with the actuality that "is." Indeed, in his discussion of the "actuality of the rational and the rationality of the actual" in the introduction to the Encyclopedia Logic, Hegel mocks the Kantian distinction between what we know empirically "to be" and what we know practically "ought to be." Hegel scoffs, "[A]s if the world had waited on [philosophy] to learn how it ought to be, and was not!"45 Fackenheim's notion of resistance as thought seeks to oppose itself, quite explicitly, to both the Kantian and the Hegelian views of the relationship between what is and what ought to be. The Holocaust cannot be grasped in its 43. Ibid., 239. 44. Cf. Morgan's fine account of resistance thought, "The Central Problem of To Mend the World!" 308-309. 45. See Paragraph 6 of G. W. F. Hegel, Enzylkop?die der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse (1830), hg., F. Nicolin u. O. P?ggeler, (Hamburg: Meiner, 1959), 39; translated as Hegels Logic, trans. William Wallace (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), 9-10. 147</page><page sequence="16">Benjamin Pollock tmth, Fackenheim suggests, if it is taken as a necessary moment in the realization of what "ought to be" in "what is," nor can it even be grasped indirectly, as one might propose Kant's thought would suggest, as an empirical event to be judged according to a rational or moral standard of what "ought to be."46 The only philosophical way of speaking about the Holocaust truthfully is "to say no to it, or resist it."41 When we re-read To Mend the World bearing in mind Fackenheim's scribbled claim that "life cannot be with" the Holocaust while "thought must be with" the Holocaust, we thus discover there a notion of resistance thinking that is not empirically schooled before the resistance in life of the Holocaust victims.48 Rather, we seem to be directed to think this resistance thinking?this holding together of the "is" and the "ought not" of the Holocaust at once?as a form of thinking or understanding that first made possible the resistance in life of the Holocaust victims themselves. Here, Fackenheim seems to grasp the resistance on the part of the victims as evidence of a universal tmth standard that is implicit within and shared by human beings, but one that has only first been revealed in the resistance of the Holocaust victims. Fackenheim's famed deduction of "resistance as an ontological category,"491 suggest, may thus be understood transcendentally: It is the category of human knowing or thinking that grounds the possibility of resist ance to radical evil in life. It is this thinking together of the "is" and the "ought not" of the Holocaust that was performed by the Holocaust victims themselves, a resistance in thought that made it possible for the victims to resist in life?a resistance in thought, Fackenheim suggests, that makes it possible for us to philosophize today. I want to claim, therefore, that Fackenheim's scribbled suggestion that thought and thought alone is capable of being with the Holocaust, although diame trically opposed to his central claim that our post-Holocaust thinking must go to school with life, at the same time does have a precedent in To Mend the World. Moreover, once we accept this contrary account of resistance, it immediately becomes clear that basic, practical conclusions which Fackenheim draws for con temporary thinking from the model of those who resisted the Nazi horrors only 46. Cf. Laurie McRobert, "Kant and Radical Evil," in Greenspan and Nicholson, Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought, 35: "Both Kant and Fackenheim call for a turn from evil. The great difference between their positions is that Kant's individual is not presented with an actual evil to resist, while Fackenheim's is." Despite Fackenheim's protest to the contrary, Reiner Munk sees Fackenheim's conception of resistance as deeply indebted to Kant's categorical imperative. See his "Revelation and Resistance," in Greenspan and Nicholson, Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought, 240. 47. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 239. 48. Reiner Munk does appear to understand resistance in this fashion, as he writes, "Contem plating the Sho 'ah we can observe that it was a reality ('is'), but a reality that ought not to have existed ('ought not'). For thought, this means that it must rebel against that reality. In line with Hegel, Fackenheim asserts that such rebellion is possible for thought only if this resistance was also present in everyday life during the Sho 'ah." See "Revelation and Resistance," in Greenspan and Nicholson, Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought, 231. 49. Cf. "Resistance as an Ontological Category: An Essay in Critical Analysis," Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 225-50. 148</page><page sequence="17">Thought Going to School with Life? make sense under the assumption that it was life that went to school with thought in the Holocaust and not the reverse. Thus, when Fackenheim claims that our own resistance in thought must "point beyond the sphere of thought altogether, to a resistance which is not in 'mere' thought but rather in overt, flesh-and-blood action and life," he roots the possibility of grounding contemporary life in our resisting thought on the very evidence of such grounding of life in thought among the victims of the Holocaust: "Their resisting thought pointed to and helped make possible a resisting life; our post-Holocaust thought...would still lapse into unauthenticity if it remained in an academically-self enclosed circle?if it failed to point to, and help make possible, a post-Holocaust life."50 Though such a passage certainly continues to reflect Fackenheim's long standing commitment to "post-Holocaust life,"51 we could not be further from a thinking that "goes to school with life." Can a grounding of resisting life in resisting thought during the Holocaust ultimately be reconciled with Fackenheim's expressed commitment to the ground ing of thought in resisting life? Given the dialectical character of his thinking, we might attempt to reconcile these opposing strands in To Mend the World by suggesting that Fackenheim is, in fact, thinking in even more Hegelian a fashion than he himself concedes.52 Of the way "To Mend the World's thought goes itself to school with life," Fackenheim says that such a methodological com mitment might appear "arbitrary, perhaps, for others, but not for a Hegelian-after Hegel," thinking, no doubt, of the way Hegel's "owl of Minerva rises to flight only with the coming of dusk."53 But as we have seen, Fackenheim's early writings on Hegel repeatedly note that Hegel was only able to grasp the dialectical character of historical life in his time in thought because that life was itself understood as having realized the ideal of reason. Only the fact that "the Rational has become actual" through history, we recall, "renders possible the Hegelian philosophy? the recognition of the rationality in the Actual."54 50. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 239, 249. Cf. Michael Morgan, "Philosophy, History, and the Jewish Thinker: Philosophy and Jewish Thought in To Mend the World," in Greenspan and Nicholson, Fackenheim: German Philosophy and Jewish Thought, 156. 51. On the special import that Fackenheim attributes to "amcha," see, for example, Zachary Braiterman, (God) after Auschwitz: Tradition and Change in Post-Holocaust Jewish Thought (Prince ton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998), 147. See also David Blumenthal's account of Fackenheim as mediator "in-between history, amcha, humanity in general, and the sources of Jewish tradition," in his "Emil Fackenheim: Theodicy and the Tikkun of Protest," http://www.js.emory.edu/blumenthal/ fackenheim.html. 52. Cf. Martin Kavka, Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 30: "Even when (as in his book of constructive post-Holocaust thought, To Mend the World) he shows how history has revealed the failure of Hegelian dialectic, Fackenheim nevertheless maintains that this failure is part of the dialectic of history, which has dialec tical results. Hegel's conclusions may be wrong; Hegelian method is not." 53. See Fackenheim's formulation of Hegel's famous ending to the preface of his Philosophy of Right in To Mend the World, 15. 54. Fackenheim, "On the Actuality of the Rational and the Rationality of the Actual," 697. 149</page><page sequence="18">Benjamin Pollock On this Hegelian model, we may suggest that Fackenheim does indeed "go to school" with the resistance carried out in life by the resisting victims at Auschwitz. But the very life with which we go to school in To Mend the World has itself been made possible?on this dialectical reading?by the resisting thought of those victims.55 Such a reconciliation would be plausible, of course, only if we were willing to ignore all of Fackenheim's statements that reject such a reconciliation. Fackenheim himself, we have seen, despite his firm ground ing in dialectical thinking, takes the two opposite positions we have reconciled to be firm enough in their opposition that he declares one as the motto of To Mend the World and then declares a change of mind upon abandoning it. * * * Thus far, our reading of the note card Fackenheim left us in his personal copy of To Mend the World has shown its content should more accurately be seen as marking Fackenheim's explicit recognition of an ambivalence inherent in his thinking since To Mend the World than as the change of mind that this note card announces itself to be. On this reading, Fackenheim's scribbled note announcing a "change of mind" in fact points less to a last-breath, revolutionary change in his thinking than it does to a long standing tension within his thought that might have gone unnoticed without the clue his note card provides. The note card thus serves to open our eyes to those different lines of thought, and to the different possibilities of what post-Holocaust Jewish philosophy can and should be, that are intertwined in Fackenheim's corpus. Do the apparent precedents of the key ideas in the note card found in To Mend the World suggest that we should take this note card itself as the continuation of those early reservations?written, conceivably, shortly after the second edition of To Mend the World was published?rather than as a late shift in thinking? Perhaps. But despite all the reasons that speak in its favor, there is yet some thing troubling about such a reading of the note card: It assumes that Fackenheim did not understand what he was doing when he wrote of his change of mind on the note card and clipped it onto those pages in which To Mend the World begins its schooling with life "in earnest." It assumes that when Fackenheim thought he had changed his mind, he was actually only developing some underdeveloped strands of his earlier thinking. But the question remains: What if Fackenheim actually understood fully well what he was doing when he wrote the note card? What if?the ambivalence we have uncovered within his earlier writing notwithstanding?Fackenheim did indeed change his mind decisively in his last years? What I'd like to show in the remainder of this article is that there is, in fact, evidence to support a very different reading of the note card than the one offered 55. Another way to reconcile Fackenheim's suggestions that resistance was originally a way of living or a way of thinking is to suggest that the Commanding Voice of Auschwitz (to which Fackenheim understands those who resisted were responding) is a kind of "revelation" that seizes the human being in a way that translates equally into thought and being. Here, one would have to explore further the touchy question of whether Fackenheim attributes revelatory significance to Ausch witz. On this last question, see Steven T. Katz's valuable discussion in Post-Holocaust Dialogues: Critical Studies in Modern Jewish Thought (New York: New York University Press, 1983), 215-25. 150</page><page sequence="19">Thought Going to School with Life? thus far. Examining the content of the note card within the context of the lectures and articles Fackenheim delivered and published in the last years of his life suggests rather convincingly that Fackenheim's note card fits this late period and that it merely articulates in nuce what these articles and lectures communicate more diffusely: that Fackenheim did indeed change his mind decisively in the last years of his life regarding the central claims of his post-Holocaust thought. Signifi cantly, Fackenheim's last writings suggest that the change to which the note card bears witness is the result of Fackenheim's late r??valuation of precisely those issues that we have found to be consistently central to his thinking. We find in Fackenheim's late writings, I suggest, a reassessment of the contemporary histori cal moment, as well as both a r??valuation of the character ofthat life victimized at Auschwitz and a drastic reconsideration of the character and purpose of post Holocaust thought. Here, too, I claim that, amid the changes in philosophical pos ition in these last years, Fackenheim continues to ask himself the same question that plagued him throughout his career: Can philosophy in fact confront the Holocaust as it truly was without either ignoring the true magnitude of the rupture it represents or surrendering to despair? As we shall see, Fackenheim's late reflections on this ques tion are the darkest, and perhaps the most searching, of all his writings. If Fackenheim did indeed change his mind in his later years regarding the task and possibility of post-Holocaust philosophy, then I suggest it was the problem of the Muselmann that provoked such a change of mind. Muselmann was the name given in the death camps to those prisoners who, though not yet dead, were seen as having lost all vestige of living spirit.56 According to Primo Levi, "the Muselm?nner, the drowned, form the backbone of the camp, an anon ymous mass, continuously renewed and always identical, of non-men who march and labour in silence, the divine spark dead within them, already too empty really to suffer. One hesitates to call them living; one hesitates to call their death death."51 Already in To Mend the World, Fackenheim had devoted serious attention to Levi's account of the Muselmann, declaring the Muselmann to be the "most original, most characteristic product of the entire Nazi Reich" and hence a "novum in human history."58 In To Mend the World, the Muselmann represents, for Fackenheim, "a new way of living and dying" that ruptures all previously available accounts of what it means to be human. As such, Fackenheim concludes, the Muselmann rep resents "the achievement most revelatory of the essence of the whole Nazi world."59 56. Muselmann is, of course, the German word for Muslim. It is certainly an unsettling question why, amid the absurdities that constituted "Lager jargon," this term was used to describe those reduced to such a state. On this subject, see Giorgio Agamben, Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen (New York: Zone, 1999), 44-48; and Gil Anidjar, The Jew, the Arab: A History of the Enemy (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2003), 138-46. 57.

For a sensitive treatment of Fackenheim's appropriation of Levi in To Mend the World, see David Patterson, "Man or Muselmann: Fackenheim's Elaboration on Levi's Question," in The Philosopher as Witness: Fackenheim and Responses to the 151</page><page sequence="20">Benjamin Pollock To Mend the World highlights the way the Muselmann exemplifies all that is "uniquely uncommon" about the victims of the Nazi world; but we have seen that only the resistance of those who did not become Muselm?nner in the camps provides Fackenheim with the means of advancing toward new foun dations for post-Holocaust thought in the book. The apparent gap between the call to recognize the Muselmann and the grounding of post-Holocaust thought on the basis of resisting life leads Susan Shapiro to suggest, in her critical tribute to Fackenheim, "For Thy Breach Is Great Like the Sea: Who Can Heal Thee?" that although "Fackenheim in no way wants to slight or make secondary the mute testimony of the Muselm?nner, his privileging of physical and spiritual resistance issues in such a denigration."60 In the second edition of To Mend the World (1989), Fackenheim praises Shapiro's article as "an excellent review.. .indeed, the best I've read." He responds to her criticism in a footnote, suggesting that the dialectical movement of thinking in To Mend the World holds on to the "mute testimony of the Muselm?nner," that "the Muselm?nner are not left behind as this thought reaches the resistance that mends its own ontological foundations."61 But later writings seem to indicate that Fackenheim recognized Shapiro's criticism as raising more serious problems for To Mend the World's schooling before resisting life than he initially cared to admit. Might not such a privileging of resistance be seen as a form of the very reductionism Fackenheim sought so desperately to avoid in his post-Holocaust thinking? If the "life" that emerges most uniquely from a prolonged, honest look at the Holocaust world is the "life" of those whom "one hesitates to call living," how could Fackenheim "go to school" with resisting life without thereby ignoring precisely what most needed to be confronted? It seems to me that questions such as these led Fackenheim, in his later years, to wonder seriously whether his lifetime of post-Holocaust thinking had, in fact, fulfilled the duty imposed on it by Auschwitz. Had he really gone far enough in his attempt to see the Holocaust for what it was? The increasingly Holocaust, ed. Michael Morgan and Benjamin Pollock (Albany: State University of New York Press, forthcoming). 60. Religious Studies Review 13, no. 3 (1987): 211. Arthur A. Cohen expresses a similar com plaint that Fackenheim's positive foundation for post-Holocaust Jewish thought pales when juxtaposed against his own account of the rupture that it was supposed to mend. See "On Emil Fackenheim's To Mend the World: A Review Essay," Modern Judaism 3, no. 2 (1983): 234. 61. Fackenheim, To Mend the World, 336. I must confess that I do not see how Fackenheim's response really answers to the problem Shapiro raises. For the movement of thinking to preserve the testimony of the Muselmann while transcending it and grounding post-Holocaust thought in resistance, one would have to be able to say, dialectically, that even for those in whom resistance was most absent, resistance somehow was still present (or, alternatively, that even in those who resisted, Muselmann hood was nevertheless present). But Fackenheim "moves" from the Muselmann to resistance in the body of To Mend the World not dialectically but by simply redirecting our attention from the Musel mann to those capable of resistance. See, e.g., p. 217: "We move on. One asks: Why did so many become Muselm?nner? One ought to ask: How did not even one not become a Muselmann? The logic of destruction was irresistible: then how was it, nevertheless, resisted?" 152</page><page sequence="21">Thought Going to School with Life? critical attitude Fackenheim takes toward his own major works suggests that he was inclined to answer this question in the negative. Thus, already in The Jewish Bible after the Holocaust (1990), Fackenheim suggests that at the present moment?eight years after the publication of the first edition of To Mend the World?"most of the evidence indicates that it is too soon, still, for a post-Holocaust theology worthy of the name?indeed, for settling whether such a thing is possible."62 In his 1996 lecture "Jewish-Christian Relations after the Holocaust," he likewise asserts that "the theological thought required by the cat astrophe has hardly begun."63 And reflecting back on To Mend the World in the introduction to The God Within (1996), Fackenheim remarks, Such as it is, To Mend the World.. .is my magnum opus. It was first published in 1982. Over a decade has passed since then. The Holocaust ended half a century ago. Most of the survivors are gone. Holocaust literature has become a vast library. Quite a few theologians and some philosophers have written. Yet now I wonder whether the truly radical response required in either discipline is not still largely missing?whether it either is yet to come or will never come at all.64 Fackenheim's series of comments here intimate real reservations regarding To Mend the World?"such as it is"?even as they declare the book to be his greatest work. Fackenheim implies here that To Mend the World does not offer the "truly radical response" to the Holocaust that is required in theology and philosophy. Even in his own post-Holocaust thinking, Fackenheim now finds no "post Holocaust theology worthy of the name"; his work has not even settled whether such post-Holocaust thinking is possible. On the contrary, Fackenheim now seems to view his own body of work as evidence indicating that "it is too soon" still for such a thinking, and this leaves him pondering once again, in a Nietzschean mood, whether the appropriately radical philosophical or theological response to the Holocaust "is yet to come or will never come at all." It appears likely to me that it is Fackenheim's increased preoccupation with the Muselmann during the 1990s that leads him to question whether his "going-to school-with-life" approach of To Mend the World and earlier texts is indeed radical enough to confront the Holocaust world in its tmth without evasion. But there is no need for guesswork when it comes to two of the last articles Fackenheim was to publish?"Abraham's Covenant under Assault: The Need for a Post-Holocaust Theology, Jewish, Christian and Muslim" (2000) and "In Memory of Leo Baeck, and Other Jewish Thinkers 'In Dark Times': Once More 'After Auschwitz, Jerusalem"' (2002). In these essays, Fackenheim explicitly cites the problem of the 62. Emil L. Fackenheim, The Jewish Bible after the Holocaust: A Re-Reading (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990), 72. 63.

Both articles devote attention to a late comment by Primo Levi on the Muselmann, to the effect that the Muselm?nner were not only the ultimate victims of Auschwitz but were, additionally, the only "complete witnesses" to the radical evil perpetrated in the death camps. These very witnesses "who saw the Gorgon," Levi asserts, have not returned to tell about it or have returned mute, but they are the 'Muselm?nner,' the submerged, the complete witnesses, the ones whose depo sition would have a general significance. They are the rule, we are the excep tion... .Even if they had paper and pen, the drowned would not have testified because their death had begun before that of their body.... We speak in their stead, by proxy.65 In his comments on this passage in these two late articles, Fackenheim makes it quite clear that he finds his own earlier "going to school with life" to be inadequate when held up in full view of the Muselmann. Thus, in "In Memory of Leo Baeck," he writes, with regard to his 614th Commandment, These are the only words of mine which have become well-known; but, after Primo Levi on the Muselm?nner, how can I still say them? In order to be more than mere words, hence cheap, the "commandment" itself must have been practiced in Auschwitz itself, if but by few. But Levi's Muselm?nner were many, too tired to understand, even life and death, hence could not under stand?let alone obey?commandments: these victims, then, are ultimate.66 Included in this passage, interestingly, is the answer Fackenheim had long given to questions regarding the possibility of making philosophical statements about the Holocaust today together with the rejection of this selfsame answer. As we have seen, Fackenheim had long seen such statements as possible today only on the grounds of their actuality during the Holocaust: In order for Fackenheim to be able to formulate the 614th Commandment philosophically, "the 'commandment' itself must have been practiced in Auschwitz itself, if but by few." But "after Primo Levi on the Muselm?nner," this answer no longer satisfies Fackenheim. To the contrary, it is precisely the Muselmann's inability to "understand?let alone obey?commandments," the Muselmann's inability to resist, that forces Facken heim to recognize the Muselmann as the "ultimate" victim of Auschwitz. In the face of this victim, Fackenheim asks, "how can I still say" what I have said for so long? In remarkably similar terms, Fackenheim writes the following, in his "Abraham's Covenant under Assault," regarding the kinds of living resistance pri vileged in To Mend the World'. "A theology that attends to partial witnesses?the 65. Primo Levi, The Drowned and the Saved, trans. Raymond Rosenthal (New York: Vintage, 1989), 83-84. 66.

None but the Muselm?nner force theological thought directly?pitilessly, without cushioning comfort?to a world without pity and comfort."67 These two dramatic passages show Fackenheim questioning his career-long approach to post-Holocaust thinking in no uncertain terms. How can he still speak of a Commanding Voice heard "by few" at Auschwitz, Fackenheim asks himself, in the presence of the ultimate victims? How could he have privileged the testimony of those who resisted, whose testimony with regard to the ultimate experience of the death camp is thereby only partial, while ignoring the "complete witnesses"? No resisting life can teach thought how to confront the fact of the Muselmann, for all such life has?by definition?been spared the abysmal tmth to which only the Muselmann mutely bears witness. In the last years of his life, we find, Fackenheim arrives at the conclusion that only a thinking that confronts the Muselm?nner directly as the ultimate victims and the complete witnesses of what occurred at Auschwitz, without turning away from them to take up the edifying subject of resistance in life, opens itself up to the tmth of what happened there. On the path to this conclusion, Fackenheim is clearly haunted by the testi mony?and the apparent suicide?of Primo Levi. Thus, after quoting from Levi's account of the Muselmann as the only "complete witness," Fackenheim adds, "Having written that, he took his life."68 The implications Fackenheim wishes us to draw from the juxtaposition of Levi's account of the Muselmann and his apparent suicide are clear: Through To Mend the World, Fackenheim had not yet taken the phenomenon of the Muselmann for what it was. Levi had?with the result that he had to put an end to his life.69 A confrontation with the Holocaust that looks the Muselmann in the face exchanges the comfort of resistance 67.

Pawlikowski, and Joseph Sievers (Hoboken, NJ: Ktav, 2000), 5. Fackenheim's self-criticism here echoes the criticism that Zachary Braiterman directs toward his work in (God) after Auschwitz, esp. 150: "These small isolated figures of resistance (pregnant women, a lonely phil osophy professor, an isolated clergyman, desperate ghetto fighters) prove disproportionate to the gross fissure that Fackenheim hopes to heal by their example." By introducing the Derridean notion of the "supplement," Braiterman offers an interesting way of thinking about the way that "life-affirming" acts and events after the Holocaust may be seen as contributing to a post-Holocaust mending without implying that such acts and events are in any way sufficient in themselves to realize such a task. See Braiterman, (God) after Auschwitz, 158-60. 68.1 take this particular formulation from "Assault on Abraham: Thought after Fifty Years," a paper Fackenheim gave at Bochum upon receiving an honorary doctorate from the Ruhr Universit?t on May 20, 1998. It will appear in the appendix of Fackenheim's forthcoming memoirs, to be published by University of Wisconsin Press. But cf. Fackenheim, "In Memory of Leo Baeck," 288: "Some still wonder whether Levi did commit suicide; but, whether he did or not, he is no longer with us." 69. On the relationship between Levi's writing and his apparent suicide, see also S. D.

Life cannot but end itself, Fackenheim implies, if it confronts the Muselmann honestly. Life "cannot" "be with" this ultimate product of the Holocaust world; or, said otherwise, an authentic response to the Holocaust in life is impossible without ending in self-destmction. Having arrived at this conclusion, Fackenheim asks himself in his last writ ings, "Now that Levi is dead, who is proxy?" That is to say: Given the incapacity of life, who can confront the Muselm?nner and stand in "by proxy," bearing witness for them after the Holocaust? Fackenheim answers his own question by presenting the task of post-Holocaust thinking in a whole new light: "It is impossible for flesh-and-blood humans: there remains only thought."70 "For humans of flesh-and-blood it is impossible, hence there remains only philosophy, possibly all of it, certainly the Jewish."71 In consideration of the phenomenon of the Muselmann, we find that Fackenheim comes to the conclusion that the task of thought after the Holocaust is no longer to "go to school with life"; indeed, life, now, is understood as incap able of confronting the Muselmann and at once surviving such confrontation. Instead, Fackenheim now declares it to be the vocation of thought alone to con front this ultimate "achievement most revelatory of the essence of the whole Nazi world" directly. Given Fackenheim's career-long preoccupation with the meaning of "thought" itself, it is quite strange to consider what thought has become for him in these essays written toward the end of his life. Thinking is no longer dialectical, capable of grasping life through its movement of negation; thinking is not empiri cal, schooled at the hands of life; thinking does not resist here, as it does in the heart of To Mend the World; and it is certainly no longer a "tranquil thought," or "cool deductive reason and measured inquiry."72 Thinking now appears to entail nothing more and nothing less than looking the Muselmann unflinchingly in the eyes in order to see reflected there the abyss opened up by the Holocaust world. Thinking becomes the bearing of witness, by proxy, to the event in which this abyss opened up.73 And the philosophers who take up this vocation?recalling now Hegelian Celan, his equation of life and 'responsibility' render his suicide, no matter what the circumstances that might have induced it, an admission of the failure to meet that responsibility." 70. Fackenheim, "In Memory of Leo Baeck," 288. 71. This is the formulation that Fackenheim used to make the same point in the original lecture version of this paper, which was presented at the 2001 conference marking Fackenheim's eighty-fifth birthday. This version will appear in Morgan and Pollock, The Philosopher as Witness. 72. Braiterman, (God) after Auschwitz, 146: "When Fackenheim claims that the Holocaust rup tures 'thought,' he means that it has shattered tranquil thought....Affect interferes with cool deductive reason and measured inquiry." 73. In Remnants of Auschwitz, Giorgio Agamben similarly claims, "[W]e will not understand what Auschwitz is if we do not first understand who or what the Muselmann is?if we do not learn to gaze with him upon the Gorgon" (52). In this image of the Gorgon, Agamben suggests, Levi reveals "that at the 'bottom' of the human being there is nothing other than an impossibility of seeing?this is the Gorgon, whose vision transforms the human being into a non-human" (54). Agamben likewise seeks to highlight the paradoxical character of Levi's designation of the Muselm?nner 156</page><page sequence="25">Thought Going to School with Life? parallels?indeed become "an isolated order of priests," preserving the truth ofthat abysmal event in a "separate sanctuary" until that moment?which may or may not come?in which "life" may be able to confront it and live. We should no longer be surprised, finally, to find that in precisely Fackenheim's last published articles, in which he reconsiders the respective capacities and vocations of life and thought after the Holocaust, he likewise ques tions what may be expected from his post-Holocaust moment. In his "In Memory of Leo Baeck," he writes, It seems, then, that we are in the midst of a contest, lasting perhaps for another hundred years, at the end of which the Holocaust will either be denied or dis torted beyond belief, or else?with patient scholarship, pious memory for which that past "will never go away" and?perhaps above all?an always insufficient-philosophy be recognized for what it was.74 By end of his life, we find, Fackenheim has changed his mind about what he had long taken to be the only possibility for post-Holocaust thinking?that is, one that goes to school with life. He comes to see in the Holocaust a rupture so extreme as to make a living response impossible, and he becomes convinced that thought alone can confront that rupture. Such a r??valuation of the relative capacities of thought and life in responding to the Holocaust are accompanied, once more, by questions regarding how the contemporary historical moment should be under stood. They lead him to ask whether the moment in which he writes marks a step toward the collective human "recognition" of the Holocaust as "what it was," or rather a step toward the forgetting of the event, or its final denial or distortion. They lead him to propose, that is, that his present moment is "both too late and to early" for such a response in life.75 alone as the "complete witnesses," in whose stead we speak "by proxy": "testimony takes place where the speechless one makes the speaking one speak and where the one who speaks bears the impossibility of speaking in his own speech, such that the silent and the speaking, the inhuman and the human enter into a zone of indistinction in which it is impossible to establish the position of the subject, to identify the 'imagined substance' of the T and, along with it, the true witness" (120). And yet, Agamben concludes, "in the Muselmann, the impossibility of bearing witness is no longer a mere privation. Instead, it has become real; it exists as such. If the survivor bears witness not to the gas chambers or to Auschwitz but to the Muselmann, if he speaks only on the basis of an impossibility of speaking, then his testimony cannot be denied" (164). 74. Fackenheim, "In Memory of Leo Baeck," 283. Cf. the original lecture version of this state ment, which will appear in Morgan and Pollock, The Philosopher as Witness: "It seems, then, that we are in the midst of a race, lasting perhaps for a hundred years, at the end of which the Holocaust will either be denied or?much the same?be distorted beyond recognition, or else?with patient scholar ship, pious memory for which that past will never go away and an always-insufficient-philosophy be recognized for what it was. And of the hundred years only just over sixty are gone." 75. Cf. the similar sentiment that Fackenheim expresses in "Abraham's Covenant under Assault," 3: "It may be late?even too late?for experience; but is it too late for thought, theological thought?" 157</page><page sequence="26">Benjamin Pollock Fackenheim's reflections in these late articles?on the deficiencies of his own career-long approach to post-Holocaust philosophy, on questions of thought, life, and the contemporary historical moment?are thus precisely those that might have produced the note card he left for us in his personal copy of To Mend the World: "I have changed my mind or maybe it is too late and too early. Life cannot now be with it, but thought can and must." * * * The note card we have interpreted in this article has indeed made us aware of tensions between different lines of post-Holocaust thinking that were present in Fackenheim's mature works, and it has thereby allowed us to discover possibilities for post-Holocaust thinking there that Fackenheim did not emphasize outright. But there is at once ample evidence to suggest that this note card comes from Fackenheim's last years and communicates not a long-standing ambivalence but rather the results of a sincere, renewed confron tation with the problem at hand.76 Fackenheim's late turn to thought as the only medium through which the ultimate truth of the Holocaust may be confronted opposes his long-standing com mitment to go to school with Holocaust and post-Holocaust life. But we may suggest that even in this opposition, Fackenheim's late turn shares its question in common with that earlier commitment: It is an alternative response to the very question that plagued Fackenheim throughout his work on the Holocaust: Can philosophy confront the Holocaust in its truth without either ignoring what truly occurred or falling into nihilism? But if we take the note card as an expression of such a late turn, we must recognize, at once, how glaringly different Fackenheim's response in it is from the more hopeful responses of his most productive period. For, in a sense, this late response on Fackenheim's part to the question of whether thought can con front the Holocaust without escapism or despair is no positive response at all. To the contrary: It is a concession that the problem does not in fact admit of a res olution. Philosophy cannot respond to the Holocaust without either reduction or 76. It would have been preferable to end this article by dating Fackenheim's writing of the note card itself. To do so responsibly, we would have to supplement the analysis of the ideational content of the note card that I have offered with an analysis of Fackenheim's handwriting in the note card. This would allow us to locate Fackenheim's handwriting at the time the note card was written along the con tinuum of his handwriting as it evolved over his career. Suffice it to say that doing so would require both financial resources and access to Fackenheim's handwritten manuscripts?most of which have not yet arrived at their final resting place in the Fackenheim archives in Ottawa?that are unavailable to me at present. Without such verification, I can only speculate. I am inclined to date the card very late?within the last two or three years of his life. But I think that the most one can really say at this point?whether we take the note card to express the late recognition of earlier tensions in Fackenheim's thought or as an actual late change of mind?is that the card most likely was written sometime after 1996. It is around this date that Fackenheim ceases (with one notable exception) to invoke his "thought going to school with life" motto in public and in writing, and it is in 1997 that we begin to see written expression of Fackenheim's renewed confrontation with the problem of the Muselmann. 158</page><page sequence="27">Thought Going to School with Life? despair. In such a situation, Fackenheim suggests, philosophy must choose the despair brought on by confronting the Muselmann over reducing the Holocaust to the level of a more conceivable inhumanity. And Fackenheim assumes thought somehow to be strong enough to endure, to preserve this source of despair within its "separate sanctuary" until that time when it may yet be possible to expose life to the Holocaust without destroying it.
