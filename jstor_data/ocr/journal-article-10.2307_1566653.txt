The Jewish Messiahs: From the Galilee to Crown Heights. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. viii, 297 pp. I The study of Jewish messiahs, messianic movements, and messianic expectations has developed over the last century in nonlinear waves of scholarship as intense and controversial as any area of Jewish research. The first great Jewish historian of these phenomena was Heinrich Graetz, who dedicated considerable effort to examining and reproducing documents concerning a long chain of messianic expectations in his History of the Jews.' Though all subsequent research is in Graetz's debt, it is not difficult to detect his polemical attitude. Messianic and 1. Many early modem Christian scholars wrote extensive essays on Jewish messianism, but these were polemical works with a generally non-scientific approach. See especially Jacques Basnage de Beauval, L 'histoire et la rdligion des Juifs depuis Jdsus Christ jusqu 'i present (1706- 11). Jewish authors such as Rabbi Jacob Emden and Rabbi Abraham Farissol wrote about specific movements with a more critical, though still highly polemical approach, but it is hard to speak of such writings as histories of the phenomena in general. AJS Review 25/1 (2000/2001): 71-83 71</page><page sequence="2">72 MATT GOLDISH mystical beliefs were anathema to Graetz's Haskalah sensibilities; he was embarrassed by them and tried to attribute them to foreign influences. While many German scholars followed in the same vein as Graetz, David Kahane (Kogan), a Polish scholar, wrote his History of the Kabbalists, Sabbateans and Hasidim, which, while not devoid of bias, was also scientific and far less antagonistic to its subject material than Graetz's work had been. As Joseph Klausner comments, Kahane was one of the first modem scholars to treat Jewish mystics and messianists with respect, "neither mocking them nor embarrassing them, but rather showing their positive side as well."2 Kahane's relatively open attitude and scientific rigor helped prepare the field for serious academic study. The next generation produced a literature in the field that is still used today, including Julius Greenstone's Messiah Idea in Jewish History in 1904, Aaron Freimann's 'Inyane Shabbetai Sevi in 1912, Joseph Sarachek's Doctrine of the Messiah in Medieval Jewish Literature in 1923, and Abba Hillel Silver's History of Messianic Speculation in Israel in 1927. The publication of Gershom Scholem's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism in 1941 created a revolution in the field of Jewish messianism as well as mysticism. First, Scholem's massive erudition and focus on this subject allowed him to draw on sources more numerous and wide-ranging than his predecessors could. Second, Scholem placed late medieval Jewish messianism in a specific ideological framework: the history of Jewish mysticism as it unfolded particularly after the Spanish expulsion. This is especially noteworthy in connection with the Sabbatean movement, whose treatment as a mystical phenomenon had been cogently presented in Scholem's "Misvah ha-ba'ah ba- 'Averah" (Kenesset, 1936, pp. 347-392). Major Trends presents Scholem's thesis that the expulsion of the Jews from Spain created a crisis which fomented first a wave of mystical messianism, then an introspective Kabbalah of exile and redemption as taught by Rabbi Isaac Luria in sixteenth-century Safed, and then another wave of active kabbalistic messianism during the Shabbetai Sevi episode of the seventeenth century, whose success was based on its Lurianic themes. Scholem's chain of mystical messianic reaction to the catastrophe of the expulsion has been the pervasive ideological framework for the study of early modem Jewish messianism ever since. 2. Klausner, "R. David Kahane: His Life and Works," in Kahane, Toledot ha-Mequbbalim, ha- Shabbeta 'im ve-ha-Hasidim, 2nd ed., vol. 2 (Odessa, 1914), p. x.</page><page sequence="3">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 73 Scholem's picture, clearly influenced by Hegelianism, combined with the shattering events of the Holocaust and the success of Zionism to inspire the spate of research on Jewish messianism that appeared in the 1950s, particularly in Israel. Critical work by Baer, Kaufiann, Dinur, Even-Shmuel, and Klausner, among many others, appeared at this time. Indeed, it was Klausner who stated that "He who writes the history of the past writes at the same time the history of his own time, evaluating the past in the light of the values of the present."3 Three works from this period can be held up as major forces in shaping the field in its postexilic concerns: Isaiah Tishby's complete edition of Rabbi Jacob Sasportas's letters, Sisat Novel Sevi (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1954); Scholem's Shabbetai Sevi ve-ha-tenu'ah ha-shabbeta'it bi-yeme hayyav (Tel Aviv: 'Am 'Oved, 1957); and A. Z. Aescoly's ha-Tenu'ot ha-meshihiyyot be-Yisra'el (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1956). The outstanding characteristic of all three works is their concern to place primary documents squarely at the center of the historical discourse. The body of the works by Tishby and Aescoly is, in fact, all documentary, while Scholem's great monograph on Shabbetai Sevi is a brilliant study in the careful and fully explicated use of documents. There is an important difference in approach, however, in the conceptions underlying these books. Scholem sets out to expand and prove the thesis he presented in Major Trends that Sabbateanism must be seen as a Jewish mystical movement whose impetus wells up from within the Jewish world. In reality Scholem delivers much more than promised-the book presents a thorough history of the movement-but he rides the Lurianic theme heavily. Aescoly, in his collection of documents, continues the path he had taken in his Sippur David ha-Re'uveni (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1940), explaining messianic movements on the background of Jewish history, world history, politics, geography, and philology. Tishby, in presenting the single most important primary work on the Sabbatean movement, remains faithful to Scholem in offering only an essentially internal Jewish context for Sasportas, yet the Lurianic Kabbalah plays little role in his understanding of Sisat Novel Sevi. 3. Klausner, Historyah. shel ha-bayyit ha-sheni (Jerusalem, 1949), vol. 5; quoted in translation in Encyclopaedia Judaica 10:1095. Moshe Idel has dealt with some of the surrounding issues in "Academic Studies of Kabbalah in Israel, 1923-1998: A Short Survey" (forthcoming). In private discussions Idel has pointed out how Scholem, Tishby, and other scholars of Jewish messianism in mid-century explicitly state that the mystical tradition can now be understood only in the context of the destruction of European Jewry.</page><page sequence="4">74 MATT GOLDISH With these models of scholarship in place, the field of Jewish messianism has exploded in recent decades. The enormous number of new contributions have been of four general types. One type is editions and translations of primary texts, often accompanied by highly important commentary, following the model of Freimann, Aescoly, Tishby, and Even-Shmuel. In this category I include several of Aescoly's own further studies of the Reubeni and Molkho movements; the papers on Sabbateanism in Sefunot volumes 3-4 (1960) and 14 (1971-77); Tishby's Meshihiyyut be-dor gerush Sefarad u-Fortugal (Jerusalem: Merkaz Shazar, 1985); the new Hebrew translation of Thomas Coenen's Ydele verwachtinge der Joden getoont in den Persoon van Sabethai Zevi (Jerusalem: Merkaz Dinur, 1998); and most of Scholem's collected articles in Mehqarim u-meqorot le- toledot ha-Shabbeta'ut ve-gilgulehah (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1982) and Mehqarei Shabbeta'ut (Tel Aviv: 'Am 'Oved, 1991). A second very important type of material consists of topical articles dealing in detail with some particular aspect of early-modern messianism. Many of Scholem's studies fall into this category, as do those in collections like Zvi Baras' Meshihiyyut ve-'eskhatologyah (Jerusalem: Shazar Center, 1983); the Scholem Festschrift ha-Ra 'yon ha-meshihi be-Yisra'el (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1982); Marc Saperstein's edited collection Essential Papers on Messianic Movments (New York: New York University Press, 1992);Yehuda Liebes's influential Studies in Jewish Myth and Jewish Messianism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993); and Tishby's collections Netive 'emunah u-minut (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1982) and H.iqre qabbalah u-sheluhotehah, vols. 2-3 (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1993). Along with these there are hundreds of individual articles and very specific monographs, many of which offer genuinely important insights too numerous by far to explore here. A third category of material consists of complex technical investigations into Sabbatean Kabbalah. I refer particularly to Liebes's Sod ha-'emunah ha- shabbeta'it (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1995) and Avraham Elqayam's Ph.D. dissertation "Sod ha-'emunah be-khitve Natan ha-'Azati" (Hebrew University, 1994). These works carry on Scholem's project, the study of the specifically kabbalistic aspects of Sabbateanism, at a very deep level, though they often differ considerably with Scholem's conclusions.</page><page sequence="5">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 75 Finally there are the attempts at revolutionary reevaluations of Jewish messianism. These range from the sociological approach of Stephen Sharot's Messianism, Mysticism and Magic (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982), to the broad historiographical theorizing of Lional Kochan's Jews, Idols and Messiahs (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), to the sweeping theological reevaluation of messianism attempted in Dan Cohn Sherbok's The Jewish Messiah (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1997). Much has happened in this field, then, since the 1950s, and much innovation has been introduced, but it tends to be in literature read for the most part by specialists. Scholem's views remain at the center of the discourse, while Aescoly's broader historical approach has had only limited influence. With the publication of the books by Lenowitz and Idel reviewed in this essay, many of the innovations have been brought together and presented in a way that will change the face of the field. Harris Lenowitz's Jewish Messiahs carries on and extends the type of work pioneered by Aescoly, with some significant new approaches. It is a collection of texts written by Jewish messianic figures or their contemporaries, interspersed with substantial discussion of the texts' significance. Lenowitz is interested in understanding the messianic mind, and he does so through the literary genre of these accounts. Lenowitz's background is not in the disciplines that have defined research in this field-mysticism and history-but rather in literature and linguistics, which gives the work many novel dimensions. For example, he devotes considerable discussion to the texts as both literature and history. As literary works, the accounts are often of great value in themselves. When we examine them as a collection, they offer insight into Jewish messiahs and the messianic ritual. It is clear that these narratives cannot be taken as factual reports of the messiahs and their deeds; whatever "facts" might have been available are marshaled in them to guide the messiah and his followers in what they are doing and are then used again, after the event has occurred, to show how it was successful, how that messiah was and is real, or how it failed and that messiah was not in fact the messiah. (p. 14) Many of the approaches and attitudes that inform the book can be detected in this passage: the interest in the minds of messiah and believer, the necessity</page><page sequence="6">76 MATT GOLDISH of care in working with documents that are essentially propaganda, the attention to the literary uses to which accounts were put, the highly functionalist approach that Lenowitz exhibits throughout (without, however, losing sympathy for his subjects), and finally, the emphasis on a messianic "ritual" in Judaism. According to Lenowitz, the tradition of accounts concerning would-be messiahs is the script, as it were, for each new messiah to act out. As the genre grew over the generations, there was an increasing range of variations from which each new contender could select, adding his own embellishing details. The Bible offers the arch-models of messiah as king, prophet, and priest. Rabbinic literature expands the messianic idea with a rich variety of detail, and, beginning with Christianity, new accounts begin to proliferate with each new movement. (A messianic movement, in Lenowitz's view, exists only when there is an actual messianic figure at its head.) The roles of all concerned are thus well delineated, so that messiah, messianic prophet, and follower know the actions and thoughts expected of them. Everything happens at one time; chronological order means nothing. This holds true with the addition of every successive layer of literature and produces a sort of readable palimpsest, a text of texts. A relationship clearly exists between the deeds of a messiah and the texts that pass them along, and between these texts and the deeds of the next messiah and the texts that transmit those deeds. In a way, the deeds themselves are only tributaries, providing a new supply of raw materials to the dynastic lineage of the texts. (p. 15) The drama, however, is destined to fail from the start, says Lenowitz-it cannot succeed, and the messiahs know this. All Jewish messiahs are dead. The fact of their deaths is the proof of their failure. The Jewish messiahs have failed to achieve cosmic redemption; they have failed to guide their followers through the apocalypse to youth, wealth, and eternal life. Nevertheless, the fact that they continue to arise-and we can predict that a Jewish messiah will rise again-suggests that they do achieve what they mean to achieve; they do not fail to be messiahs. (p. 4) Here many readers may part ways with the author, some as believers in the veracity of traditional Jewish apocalyptic expectations, and others as observers of a wider variety of messianic possibilities in Jewish history (see below). Whether or not one agrees with the theoretical underpinnings of Lenowitz's book, its usefulness is undeniable. Scholars in the field generally know where to</page><page sequence="7">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 77 find the texts collected here, but the sources are sometimes hard to get at, and few of them have been available in English translation before. The book is therefore ideal for classroom use, where whatever points of agreement and disagreement one may have with the author's commentary can be turned into didactic tools. Furthermore, there are few scholars who have examined the entire sweep of Jewish messianic history from Jesus to the Lubavitcher Rebbe in one broad stroke, and several of the documents have been almost unstudied until now. For example, a passage concerning Asher Laimmlein Reutlingen in Pfefferkorn's Judenspiegel, translated here (pp. 100-101), was almost unused by scholars from the time of Graetz until the present (it is also used in Idel's book and in recent studies by Elisheva Carlebach). Lenowitz's most important contributions are in the study of Jacob Frank and his movement, a field in which he is one of the world's few living experts. Here he offers substantial translations from the Polish, including large sections of the little-studied Dicta. The most significant achievement of The Jewish Messiahs, then, is undoubtedly its presentation in English, in an accessible format, of many of the central texts in the history of Jewish messianism. In America translations, such as Talcott Parsons's English rendition of Max Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, are often considered milestones of intellectual history. Jewish Studies scholars, on the other hand, have tended to cherish a certain snobbery about their familiarity with texts published in far-flung locales in various languages. Surely it is appropriate in the present case to put this attitude aside and admit our indebtedness to Lenowitz for this useful book. III If Lenowitz's greatest contribution lies in his making texts available, Idel's is in the brilliant analytic power he applies to the massive literary corpus he has mastered. No scholar alive today surpasses Idel's familiarity with Jewish mystical sources in print and manuscript, as well as his breadth of knowledge in related Christian and Muslim literature. In Messianic Mystics he is at the height of his skill, deducing important new lines of thought from his studies in the documents of Jewish mysticism. Idel is similar to Lenowitz in his desire to examine the messianic consciousness of individual figures. He is also similar in his belief that there are messianic discourses which build upon each other and present ever-growing possibilities for each new messiah. While Lenowitz thinks of these discourses as</page><page sequence="8">78 MATT GOLDISH a literary genre whose power lies in the very words of the accounts, Idel's approach to the discourses is through the method of models, taken from sociology and anthropology, and developed by Idel for Jewish mysticism in his previous book Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995).4 In other words, these two authors agree that past messianic outbreaks serve as the pattern copied, combined, and embellished by later messiahs, but Lenowitz sees the accounts themselves as the focal medium of influence, whereas Idel looks at the attitudes and activities of earlier messiahs as the essential influence. Though Idel uses a much wider range of sources, in practice the literary study of account traditions and the application of anthropological models often produce similar conclusions. There is, however, a critical point on which the views of Lenowitz and Idel diverge, and it is essential to both their works. Whereas Lenowitz is interested only in messianic movements, which are defined for him by the existence of a specific messianic figure, Idel wishes to emphasize the wide variety of phenomena that Jewish mystics have understood as messianic, and thereby to expand the definition of messiah and messianism in Jewish history. The traditional model, as Idel explains, is the apocalyptic account according to which the present world will come to a cataclysmic end, and a new, Godly world replace it through the offices of a human messiah. With his interest in public movements led by a messiah, Lenowitz follows the approach of Gershom Scholem, whose understanding of messianism focused on the apocalyptic, revolutionary, and historically significant. Some of the models proposed by Idel, particularly those connected with Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, have already caused a stir in the scholarly community. The following text from Abulafia stands at the center of much novel discourse. The term mashiah is equivocal, [designating] three [different] matters; in truth, first and foremost the Agent Intellect is called the mashiah ... and the man who will forcibly bring us out of exile from under the rule of the nations due to his contact with the Agent Intellect-he will [also] be called mashiah. And the material human hylic intellect is called mashiah, and is the Redeemer and has influence over the soul and over all elevated spiritual powers. It can save the 4. Another recent and very important book on Jewish messianism, Dov Schwartz's ha-Ra 'yon ha-meshibi ba-hagut ha-Yehudit bi-yeme ha-benayyim (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1997), also makes extensive use of the method of models.</page><page sequence="9">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 79 soul from the rule of the material kings and their people and their powers, the lowly bodily desires. It is a commandment and an obligation to reveal this matter to every wise man of the wise ones of Israel in order that he may be saved because there are many things that oppose the opinions of the multitude of the rabbis, and even more differ from the views of the vulgus. (p. 65) Idel points out the influence of Maimonides (himself the purveyor of radical positions concerning the messiah) on Abulafia's messianism, whose three modes are all far from traditional apocalypticism. These are contrasted with traditional Jewish apocalyptic messianism in the following way. Roughly speaking, the more popular groups remained interested in the personalized power, which was connected to political and miraculous actions of the king-savior, while the elites conceptualized messianism in terms o[f] regularity and omnipresence. From this point of view, the Messiah's descent from the line of David remained crucial in apocalyptic messianism, while the more elitist version could not but use a more emanational explanation for the emergence of the transcendent redeemer. (p. 68) Thus, historical conditions and changing intellectual trends, under the influence of Christian and Muslim interpretations of Plato and Aristotle, are the background on which one must understand these shifting conceptions of the messiah idea. Idel points out that for Abulafia, "everyone possesses the Messiah, at least in potentia; the Messiah is a dimension of man qua man" (p. 69). Throughout the book Idel insists that among the Jewish mystics, Abulafia's internal, personal messianism, with no manifestation on the stage of history, is one of a wide range of possibilities for the interpretation of the messianic future. I see no reason not to approach it as an independent and significant messianic model, to pay due attention to its phenomenological structure as well as to its historic influence. In any case, the neglect of the possible contribution of this messianic model to the more variegated developments of Jewish messianism or its description as belonging to "spiritual deviations" [the term is applied by Abraham Berger] may bring about an academic-and somewhat dogmatic- view of what Jewish messianism was, by reducing it to a monochromatic way of thought. (p. 76)</page><page sequence="10">80 MATT GOLDISH For those scholars who have kept up with Idel's voluminous publications in scattered journals and books,5 there will be few major surprises in the rest of the volume, though there are new and important insights or interpretations on almost every page. Taken as a whole, though, the book, with its emphasis on the great variety of mystical messianic scenarios, presents a very significant rereading of the history of Jewish messianism. Following the research of Liebes, and with much important new manuscript evidence, Idel finds messianism in the theosophical Kabbalah, where Scholem saw little, and at the same time finds little where Scholem found much-in the major kabbalists from the generation of the Spanish expulsion. He offers extensive textual proof and explanation for the thesis he has argued previously, that cataclysm and messianism are often not related as cause and effect, as exemplified by the thought of Spanish Jews around 1492.6 Here he presents an excellent, detailed discussion about the acute magical messianism of the Sefer ha-meshiv circle, which thrived in Spain before the expulsion but left only scattered traces after. He explores the post-expulsion kabbalists and concludes that very few of them were acute messianists, while on the other hand there were several major messianic agitators who were not mystics or did not come out of the Spanish context. The conclusion of this discussion is that Scholem's thesis about the expulsion and the rise of mystical messianism must be carefully reevaluated. In speaking of messianism in Safed, Idel emphasizes the influence of various models, such as the "individual messianism" taught by Abulafia, while showing that traditional political apocalyptic thinking was marginal. Lurianic messianism is elitist and spiritual. The main focus of the messianic doctrine within Lurianic Kabbalah is not to promote the sociopolitical aspects of the redemption, but rather to develop its spiritual aspects by promulgating the Kabbalah as the, perfect type of knowledge. . . . Even Luria's assumption of the messianic role does not transform his Kabbalah into a full-fledged messianic doctrine but rather turns it into a pre-eschatological system. (p. 174) 5. A highly useful bibliography of Idel's work has been published by Cherub Press. 6. For an earlier rendering of this thesis, see Idel's preface to the second edition of Aescoly, ha-Tenu 'ot ha-meshihiyyot be- Yisra 'el.</page><page sequence="11">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 81 In general, says Idel, Scholem's view that Lurianic Kabbalah is messianically centered requires rethinking. He goes on to criticize other aspects of Scholem's outlook concerning the role of messianism in the spread of Lurianic Kabbalah, while emphasizing the various models that are represented in Safed. Idel similarly criticizes Scholem's incorporation of the Sabbatean outbreak into an internal Jewish chain of reaction to the Spanish expulsion. He offers convincing evidence that Lurianic Kabbalah, whose messianic redemptive themes Scholem found central in Sabbatean doctrine, was in fact still little studied in the mid-seventeenth century. On the other hand, he does admit that the image of Luria and his fellow Safed kabbalists was well known through stories and popular literature. I find this extremely significant for understanding the popularity of Sabbateanism, but this does not detract from Idel's essential point. Idel meanwhile emphasizes again the presence of various messianic models and kabbalistic influences (in addition to Lurianism) on the movement's principal figures. He particularly stresses the idea of Shabbetai's identification with Saturn, represented by the sefirah Binah for the kabbalists, and connected not only with melancholia, but also with prophecy and madness, all matters well represented in Sabbateanism. The influence of ideas about Saturn and the divine nature of the messiah, in which the Sabbateans also believed, is an area through which Idel demonstrates, among other things, the interaction among Jews, Christians, and Muslims on matters messianic. Scholem's contention that Sabbateanism was an internal movement of Jewish mysticism can hardly be upheld after Idel's comments and the research of scholars like Richard H. Popkin, who has extensively criticized the isolationist approach.7 Hasidism did not totally neutralize messianic impulses, Idel contends, but Hasidic messianism was little interested in apocalyptic and political forms. Once again, the messiah models that he finds most influential among the Hasidim were spiritual and personal. Hasidim, with the longest history of messianic models behind it, was particularly eclectic in its approach to the messiah and the possible permutations of the future. 7. See Popkin, "Three English Tellings of the Shabbetai Zvi Story," Jewish History 8 (1994): 43-54; idem, "Jewish-Christian Relations in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries: The Conception of the Messiah," Jewish History 6 (1992): 163-177.</page><page sequence="12">82 MATT GOLDISH The book concludes with a series of comments on the major topics in the overall discussion of Jewish messianism, using material found in the main body of the book to present modified positions on each. I would like to call attention to thoughts expressed at the very end of these concluding remarks. Idel's criticisms of Scholem have been the subject of much discussion, some very heated, in the world of Jewish scholarship. The present book can be read as an almost systematic critique of Scholem's views on Jewish messianism, though this in itself is an expression of the continued vitality and fruitfulness of Scholem's work. Idel offers some thoughts on the ideological background behind the opinions of Scholem and Buber, stressing Zionism as a central element. It is much more the struggle to secure and maintain the achievements of the earlier generation than an attempt to change them that characterizes the thrust of Israeli society. Is it the present moment that has inspired the emphasis on those more conservative elements in messianism that were marginalized earlier? Is the possibility of looking backward from a broader perspective related to a less tumultuous period that enables a scholar to adopt a less ideological definition, a more pluralistic and perhaps more centrifugal approach that is less concerned with the communal function of main ideas in Judaism? Is the attempt to emphasize the dialogue between the Jewish views and other, alien elements in a variety of domains, including messianic thought, part of a new historical situation? Is this novel, less apologetic situation also less dependent on the differences between Jewish thought and other systems, more open to seeing the common denominators, than the earlier emphases on the divergences? (pp. 292-293) Idel continues with a list of rhetorical questions and concludes that at present they are unanswerable, though his view is fairly clear. These queries are invaluable for the reader in understanding how Idel conceives of his own enterprise and that of his teacher, Scholem. They do not, however, offer an opening for the kind of unreasoned diatribes to which Idel has sometimes been subjected in recent years; only critiques based as heavily in texts as his own scholarship can offer meaningful dialogue. While it is sometimes uncomfortable to watch Idel dismantling one of Scholem's towering theories, nobody can honestly argue that it is done from an unlearned position. Those who knew Scholem do not remember him as a master of the gentle touch either, but nobody will deny the permanent impact of his scholarly achievement, especially not Idel.</page><page sequence="13">NEW APPROACHES TO JEWISH MYSTICISM 83 In considering these thoughts of Idel's, a final comment seems appropriate. Among the paradoxes of Scholem's work in Jewish mysticism is the relationship between Jewish and non-Jewish ideas. On the one hand, Scholem proposed schemes of mystical development whose internal Jewish nature was essential. On the other hand, who did more than Scholem to bring scholarship in Jewish mysticism and messianism into mainstream academic discourse, relating these subjects to broader movements like gnosticism, Renaissance hermeticism, and even French nationalism? Looking back at earlier works on Jewish messianism, one finds the majority written in Hebrew and thus inaccessible to a general scholarly audience. Scholem's Major Trends was written for readers of English, and the two books under discussion here consciously continue that trend. Despite his Zionism and stress on internal causation, then, Scholem succeeded in making his field a subject of importance for many disciplines--one whose literature regularly appears in English because the academic community desires access to it.8 So, while the ideology of his internalist approach is being exposed and criticized by the "revisionist" historians, his universalist impulses are ever more relevant. The works of Lenowitz and Idel represent an important step forward in the field of Jewish messianism for a variety of reasons. They offer the latest in textual scholarship and sophisticated interpretation in English for the use of a broad readership. They bring a wide view of Jewish messianic history together, and propose important theories concerning the relationship between movements. Lenowitz creates what (particularly together with Saperstein's Essential Papers) will undoubtedly be a standard textbook for college teaching of messianism. He also brings fresh ideas and literary sensibilities to the field. Idel pushes forward the frontiers of interpretation by proposing a new realm of messianic possibilities in Jewish history. He offers detailed textual proof for an enormous number of novel insights. These books are by no means the last word on Jewish messianism, nor are they intended to be. Much remains to be explored from the standpoint of history, sociology, and literature as well as mysticism. But all future authors on the subject will be in the debt of these authors.
