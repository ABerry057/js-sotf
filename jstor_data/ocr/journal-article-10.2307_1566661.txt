Monumenta Paleographica Medii Aevi: Series Hebraica. Vol. 1: Jusqu'd 1020. Turnhout, Belgium, Brepols Publishers for the Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des Textes, CNRS Paris. Jerusalem: Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1997. 135, [1] p., 55 plates. (Hebrew and French). Many years ago I read somewhere that Ernst Simon once said, speaking of Gershom Scholem and his studies on Jewish mysticism, that many great scholars had made enormous contributions to scholarship and learning, but Scholem had not only enriched a field, he had actually created a brand-new discipline. One could apply this statement to Malachi Beit-Ari6 and Colette Sirat, the directors of a joint Israeli-French project for the study of the codicology and paleography of Hebrew manuscripts. The project began in 1965, and it revolutionized the field. While I do not wish to minimize the immense accomplishments of the great Hebrew bibliographers of modem Jewish scholarship in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries-foremost among them Moritz Steinschneider, the author of many catalogs of important collections of Hebrew manuscripts in European libraries-it must be said that the study and description of Hebrew manuscripts in those days was based on individual intuition and impressionistic evaluations. There was no systematic description and quantification of the various elements a scholar must keep in mind and examine when trying to determine the decisive factors for the identification and description of a medieval Hebrew manuscript. Furthermore, codicology, the study of the physical aspect of the manuscript as an artifact, its material, its preparation, the local geographic variations of manuscript making, was never drawn into the purview of Hebrew manuscript study. The many types of medieval Hebrew script were considered and classified, some of the scribal practices were noted, but the characteristics of the manuscript codex as a physical entity were ignored almost completely. Under the direction of Beit-Arid and Sirat, with the assistance of a talented staff, the systematic assembly and analysis of data concerning medieval Hebrew manuscripts were developed. No doubt, the availability of computer technology helped a great deal, and with a progressive and innovative spirit the directors of the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 115 project created a huge database, called Sfar-Data, that became the instrument through which the pioneering works of the project were prepared and published. A list of these very useful and important books is found on pages 7-8 (in French), 12 (in Hebrew), and 17 (in English) of the work under review. These include the seven volumes of Manuscrits mddidvaux en caractdres hdbrarques, a work that contains facsimiles of representative pages and notes on dated Hebrew manuscripts until 1540 from French and Israeli libraries. In addition to this series, several monographs on various aspects of Hebrew paleography were issued, including a fascinating dissertation on colophons in medieval Hebrew manuscripts by Michael Riegler. Now, a monumental new work has appeared that includes the best results of the research of the Institute's leadership and staff. The present volume is the first of a planned series in eight parts that will deal with all the known dated Hebrew manuscripts in the world's public and private libraries and collections, arranged chronologically, covering the period from the first appearance of a dated Hebrew manuscript (in 894/895?) until the year 1280. Representative pages of the manuscripts will be reproduced in the original size, as will be the colophons, and detailed descriptions and notes will accompany the reproductions. The first volume, now in our hands, is a joy to behold, both from the point of view of book production and of its contents. The large folio volume contains introductions in Hebrew, English, and French, descriptions and notes in Hebrew and French in parallel columns, and beautiful, apparently faithful, reproductions of selected pages of the originals. Eighteen manuscripts, dating from 894/5? to 1020, are discussed in the volume. Of course, in future volumes there will be many more for periods of comparable length because of the proliferation of Hebrew manuscripts in subsequent centuries. An analysis of the contents yields some interesting points. Many of the eighteen items are extremely fragmentary, some surviving in only one or two leaves. The dating of at least two of the manuscripts is doubtful, as acknowledged by the authors (manuscripts I and 6, the latter the famous Aleppo Codex). All the manuscripts were written outside Europe in Islamic countries, in the Middle East and perhaps in North Africa. This proves, first and foremost, how rare dated Hebrew manuscripts are in the period covered, namely, the tenth and early eleventh centuries. Hebrew texts were transmitted in scroll form for a much longer time than Latin and Greek manuscripts. The codex form was probably not accepted by the</page><page sequence="3">116 BOOK REVIEWS Jewish community until the eighth century, about halfa millennium after it became the common vehicle for writings in the Christian environment. Accordingly, it is no great surprise that the first surviving remnants of Hebrew codices stem from so relatively late a period. The geographic distribution of the manuscripts described in the present volume confirms our knowledge of the history of Jewish centers in the Middle Ages, indicating that around the turn of the second millennium Jewish cultural life was still concentrated mainly in centers outside of Europe. These factors explain, at least to some extent, the meagerness of these materials, but obvious questions still arise: Why did the Jews adopt the codex form so late? Why have so few dated Hebrew manuscripts survived from this period, when there are so many more known manuscripts from the Christian and Muslim realms? Was it mainly because of the persecutions and dislocations, or are there other possible reasons, perhaps connected with the nature of study among the Jews in this period? Also, the eighteen items are all Bibles and Bible commentaries, many of them associated with Karaites. The only non-biblical work (no. 16) is also by a Karaite, the theologian Ya'qub al-Qirqisani. Where are the manuscripts of rabbinic works, such as the Talmud and Midrash and the liturgy? It is not easy to respond to these questions, but it should be remembered that this publication deals only with dated manuscripts. Among the undated ones, including many fragments from the Genizah, there are obviously quite a number of early manuscripts and fragments containing non-biblical texts. Because of the very limited number of available codex materials from this early period, it might have been advisable to include dated Genizah nonliterary documents and letters. This because of their usefulness for the study of Hebrew script, even though they could not be utilized for codicological comparisons. The material discussed in the present volume consists mainly of Bible codices, more or less complete or fragmentary. They are the earliest written evidence for the Masoretic text, and they provide a great deal of valuable data concerning the preparation, layout, vocalization, and cantillation signs of the Bible text. The identity of the scribes and other persons who may have been involved in preparing the manuscripts, as well as the names of patrons and later owners, are also often revealed in the colophons and in other notations. Of great interest is the Hebrew of the scribal inscriptions. Some of them are rhymed, and in many we find flowery expressions about the process of writing and the importance of the text as well as invocations of blessings for the scribe and the owners.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 117 The physical properties of the writing material, parchment or paper, and its preparation for writing, such as pricking and ruling, are described in great detail and with great accuracy. The manuscripts also contain texts written in Arabic in Hebrew script, and at least in one instance, both Arabic and Hebrew script are employed in the colophon (no. 14). Some of the manuscripts described here have elaborate decorations. These have significance for the history of Jewish art, and, of course, attention is called to them and to the literature about them. The identification of the texts and of the personalities and localities is fully documented with what is apparently a complete reference to previous literature. Since in a number of manuscripts the date is indicated according to different systems of reckoning (e.g., the era of creation, the Seleucid counting, the years passed since the destruction of Temple), there is an opportunity to deal with problems of Hebrew chronology. Both in the introduction and in the individual descriptions, the authors treat matters of chronology thoroughly. As befits a work that deals with the earliest dated manifestation of Hebrew codices, the present volume is elegantly produced, and attractively printed both in its Hebrew and non-Hebrew parts. As pointed out in the introductions, the French and Hebrew descriptions and notes are not identical, as they are not translations of each other, except for the colophons and the technical descriptions. The divergence here can be explained by the occasional disagreements between the Israeli scholars Mordecai Glatzer and Malachi Beit-Ari6, who were responsible for the Hebrew text, and Colette Sirat, who wrote the French text. One such instance is found in the comments relating to the Aleppo Codex (no. 6). According to Beit-Ari6 and Glatzer, the manuscript is the authentic Masoretic codex of Aaron ben Asher, written by Solomon ben Buya'a, and is identical with the model codex mentioned by Maimonides. Sirat, on the other hand, voices doubt about the authenticity of these identifications. These differences in a parallel text are somewhat disconcerting, and one has to wonder whether it would not have been possible to express such disagreements differently, perhaps in footnotes or in the introduction. There are also discrepancies in the footnotes, leading to some confusion and causing a degree of irritation to the reader. There is only one set of footnotes, and it is in Hebrew. The French text's footnote numbers refer to the Hebrew footnotes, but its numbers are not consecutive and the system is often confusing. For example, in</page><page sequence="5">118 BOOK REVIEWS the French text to manuscript 7 (pp. 28-29) the footnote numbers jump from 45 to 53! Some of the observations that are found in the Hebrew footnotes are in the body of the French text. Besides these minor annoyances, there are a few others. Nowhere do the authors state why 1280 was selected as the cut-off date. Moreover, they say nothing about the fate of the Manuscrits mddiivaux en caractires hebraiques series, mentioned above. Is it going to be discontinued completely? Are there any plans to describe Hebrew manuscripts written after 1280? Why is the title page in a mixture of Latin and French? The interesting poetic colophons are printed according to the line division of the originals. It would have been welcome to print them in their poetic forms, too, so as to make the acrostics and rhymes stand out in clearly. Despite these misgivings, the volume is veritable milestone in the annals of Hebrew manuscript research. The scholarly public eagerly awaits the publication of the subsequent volumes in this monumental series. Menahem Schmelzer Jewish Theological Seminary of America New York, New York</page></plain_text>
