It is hardly even conceivable. Since 1981, when the ground- breaking Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur appeared, Schifer and his colleagues in Germany have published a series of first-rate works (including translations and a concordance) that have not merely revolutionized the study of this forbiddingly abstruse variety of Jewish mysticism, but have made that study possible in a way it never was before. Thanks to Schafer and his coworkers, we now have the basic equipment we need to decide for ourselves whether Gershom Scholem's "Merkabah mysticism" (depicted on the basis of these texts) existed as he imagined it, and whether the place he assigned it in his scheme of "major trends in Jewish mysticism" corresponds to historical reality. Schafer himself has prepared a series of important studies bearing on these questions. The most recent of them is the present book, a sober and concise examination of the Hekhalot literature and of its major themes. That it is a good book goes almost without saying. Few people know the Hekhalot as well as Schafer, and his expertise is apparent on every page. So is his restrained, cautious approach. Scholem had supposed the Hekhalot texts to be the literary deposit of an ecstatic mysticism with strong Gnostic overtones, which he regarded as the esoteric content of the talmudic ma 'aseh merkabah. Schifer points out, correctly, that this imposes a scheme on the texts that considerably distorts their own agendas. The ecstatic journey is vastly less prominent in them than one would gather from reading Scholem. Yet one needs some sort of organizing principle in order to make one's way through the chaos of the Hekhalot. Schafer finds this principle in the supposition that the consistent topics of the Hekhalot are God, the angels, and humanity; and the relations among the three. ("Humanity," in practice, turns out largely to be those people who undertake to bring themselves into relation with God and the angels by means of the Hekhalot incantations.) He surveys, one by one, the major textual units of the Hekhalot ("macroforms") and describes their views on his three key topics. This procedure perhaps indicates that Schafer has rethought his earlier views, which tended to downplay the importance of the macroforms. It has the disadvantage of omitting from consideration those materials, often quite important, which for some reason fall outside the macroforms' bounds. (The most unfortunate example is the Genizah text published in 1969 by Ithamar Gruenwald, republished in 1984 by Schafer himself, which would</page><page sequence="3">256 BOOK REVIEWS have greatly enriched Schifer's treatment of the heavenly-journey theme. It is left entirely out of the discussion.) But it has substantial advantages as well. Schifer's topics emerge naturally from the Hekhalot themselves, and evoke no suspicion that the investigator's interests are being forced on the materials. His organization of material by macroforms helps him to do justice to its several layers as well as to the ensemble, and to avoid the snare of generalizing it all into one great homogeneous mass. How, according to Schifer, are we to understand the Hekhalot? As I have noted, Schafer rejects Scholem's reading as extreme and one-sided. He also rejects, on similar grounds, my own view (which I argued in 1988 in The Faces of Chariot) that the Hekhalot represent a fantasy-rebellion of the spiritually disenfranchised of rabbinic Judaism against the rabbinic elite. Such claims, Schafer thinks, go beyond what our current knowledge will allow; and, moreover, fail to do justice to the diversity within the Hekhalot. Schifer will speak, as I do, of the Hekhalot authors as being in rebellion against rabbinic Judaism (p. 161). But he locates this "rebellion" in a more or less abstract realm of religious ideology. In contrast to the classical rabbinic sources, the Hekhalot announce a God who-in the present, not just at Sinai or the eschaton-both reveals himself to and conceals himself from his chosen followers, human and angelic. Their authors transform the traditional values of prayer and Torah study in the light of this perception. In so doing, they dare even to imagine a God who is dependent on his human devotees. Is this enough? Will we understand the Hekhalot as human creations once we have so formulated their theology? Will we grasp how their authors can have invested such ideas with the violent emotions that are evident throughout the literature? I remain unsatisfied. The fantasies (or hallucinations, if you prefer) of the Hekhalot authors are filled with a phenomenal amount of aggression and brutality-some of it expressed openly, some projected onto the imaginary beings that are these authors' favored subjects. Internal evidence suggests that their aggression is directed against other members of their community, not outsiders. (God, the angels, and human adepts normally blast, terrorize, and usurp the powers of each other; not Gentiles or demons.) Without a hypothesis to provide a social or psychological context (or both) for this rage, the Hekhalot remain for me unsolved riddles. It is easy to imagine a retort to this criticism. Schafer might well invoke, in his support, Victor Tcherikover's dictum: "We may not extend our historical knowledge by these cautious methods, but at least we shall avoid</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 257 errors" (Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews, p. 79). I would not agree with this response-the project of comprehending the human dimension of the Hekhalot seems to me worth a certain risk of error-but I would respect it. Schaffer's cautious methods have expanded our ability to deal with the Hekhalot to a degree that we once could hardly have hoped for. We now can engage, as we could not twelve years ago, in a dialectic process of hypothesis and hypothesis-testing which may eventually move us toward a true comprehension of the Hekhalot. In this great dialogue, Schafer's latest book will remain an essential contribution. David J. Halperin University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, N.C.</page></plain_text>
