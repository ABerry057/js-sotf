Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1983. viii, 191 pp. This book is a study of the ways in which the biblical characters of Job, Jethro, and Balaam are treated in early rabbinic and Christian exegesis. The book's title comes from a midrash on Exodus 1:9 (Exod. R. 1:9 and paral- lels), which lists these figures as the three counsellors to whom Pharaoh in Egypt turned for advice when he first conspired against the Israelites. According to the midrash, each of the three gentiles acted differently and was repaid in kind by God. Balaam, who actively participated in Pharaoh's schemings, consequently died a violent death; Job, who was silent, was</page><page sequence="2">256 BOOK REVIEWS made to bear his sufferings; Jethro, who fled rather than cooperate, was alone rewarded by having his descendants sit as members of the Sanhedrin. For Baskin, the midrash's contrasting treatment of the three figures serves as a kind of index or typology of attitudes towards the gentile in Rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity. Jethro, for example, became for the rabbis the exemplar of the convert to Judaism, an identification the rabbis made by identifying Hobab in Numbers 10:29 with Jethro. As Baskin notes, this understanding of Jethro was the most positive evaluation a gen- tile could receive from the rabbis. For Christian exegetes, in contrast, the fact that Jethro had converted to Judaism, along with the other fact that he is never mentioned in the New Testament as a righteous gentile, made him a figure of considerably less interest. Baskin also makes the interesting sugges- tion that the rabbis' attitude to Jethro, which changes slightly between the tannaitic and amoraic periods, may itself reflect a change in their attitude to conversion. In the earlier period, when the rabbis wished to encourage proselytism, their treatment of Jethro is almost uniformly positive; in the later period, when Jethro is described less positively, the change may be due to less enthusiasm for conversion in general. In contrast to Jethro, Balaam represented the evil gentile. This negative evaluation is already present in the biblical portrait of the character, but the rabbis enlarged upon it by attributing to Balaam nearly every conceivable depravity as well as by emphasizing his single-minded desire to destroy the Israelites. Although the rabbis did not deny the fact that Balaam was a prophet, they made him an example of how God had indeed offered the boon of prophecy to all the nations of the world, who, however, had abused the gift and, like Balaam, had used it solely in order to harm God's chosen people. Baskin follows Urbach and other scholars in not identifying the rabbis' Balaam with the persona of Jesus, and she agrees with Urbach that the rabbinic description of Balaam's prophesying may have been shaped by familiarity with forms of ecstatic prophecy as practiced by contemporary religious sects. In any case, these two sides of Balaam-villain and prophet -are also present in Christian interpretation of the figure, though those treatments are somewhat more positive because Balaam's prophecy in Numbers 24:17, "a star rises from Jacob," was, among Christian exegetes, almost universally interpreted christologically. Baskin also considers the surprisingly sympathetic portrait of Balaam in Josephus, Antiquities, which, she suggests, may derive from an earlier and more positive Jewish tradition untouched by rabbinic-Christian polemics. Between the two opposed types of Jethro and Balaam, the figure of Job holds a mediate, ambiguous position. For the rabbis, Job was generally</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 257 considered a righteous gentile and represented, as Baskin writes, the "belief that one could, in theory, live a life pleasing to God beyond the boundaries of Israel" (p. 116). This belief, however, was itself problematic for the rabbis: for some, the fact that Job was righteous was virtually sufficient proof in itself that Job must have been Jewish; elsewhere, Job qua righteous gentile is compared unfavorably with righteous Israelites (like the patriarchs), and even in the Exodus Rabbah passage from which Baskin borrows her title one may note that Job's silence is hardly treated as a positive feature. For Christian exegetes, Job exemplified the "true Israelite" who lived before the appearance of Jesus; his life was proof that a gentile could be righteous and worthy outside the Law even before the Christian dispensation. It is not surprising that the figure of Job eventually became a biblical type for the suffering Christ of the New Testament. Baskin's study is clearly written and well organized; each of the three main chapters-one for each figure-is divided into separate sections devoted to rabbinic exegesis, nonrabbinic Jewish authors in late antiquity (mainly Philo and Josephus), and patristics (mainly Origin and Augustine). Although the book holds no great surprises, Baskin's analyses are generally persuasive. This monograph is a solid contribution to the growing body of studies of comparative exegesis in late antiquity. One wishes only that Baskin had tried to extend her work somewhat beyond the confines of comparative exegesis, and attempted to integrate her typology into a broader treatment of Jewish attitudes to outsiders. This is a field of great interest for which lack of evidence has always been cited as a reason why it has not been explored more than it has. The wealth of material Baskin has collected in this book would certainly provide her with the basis for such a study. David Stern University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pa.</page></plain_text>
