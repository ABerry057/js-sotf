Bava Batra 3b-4a) in Light of Persian Sources Jeffrey L. Rubenstein Abstract: The Bavli's story of Herod's rise to power, murder of the HasmoneanHasmonean family and of the rabbis, encounter with Bava b. Buta, and and construction of the temple, found at Bava Batra 3b-4a, has long long puzzled scholars. Many aspects of this stoiy diverge from Josephus'sJosephus's account, our main source for historical knowledge of Herod's Herod's life and deeds. This paper argues that the storyteller has been been influenced by Persian sources from the Sasanian period. Impor tanttant elements of the Bavli stoiy were modeled on the account of the rise rise of Ardashir, founder of the Sasanian dynasty, as recounted in a Sasanian Sasanian text blown as the Karnamag i Ardashir i Pabagan, "The Book Book of the Deeds of Ardashir son of Pabag. " The rabbis understood the the transition from the Hasmonean to Herodian dynasties through the prism prism of the transition from the Parthian to Sasanian dynasties. They identified identified Herod with Ardashir, and constructed a story of Herod's usurpation usurpation and rise to power on the basis of Ardashir's usurpation and rise to power as recounted in Sasanian sources. The Bavli's story of Herod at Bava Batra 3b 4a can be counted among the most colorful and dramatic talmudic stories. It features not only sex and death, but sex with death; its characters include kings and sages; the story involves politics, deception, and intrigue. And it explains the events that caused the rebuilding of the Jerusalem temple. The scholarly consensus sees the story as indebted in large part to Josephus's account of Herod's life and deeds in Antiquities xv-xvii and The Jewish War i. 18-33 (347-673). However, there is significant evidence that aside from Josephus, the story has been influenced by Persian traditions about the rise of Ardashir, founder of the Sasanian dynasty. While some depen dence on Josephus or on popular oral traditions deriving from Josephus should not be discounted, the Josephan influence has been overemphasized, perhaps understandably, given the lack of awareness of the Sasanian material. I would like to thank Yaakov Elman and Mahnaz Moazami, in whose seminar at Yeshiva Uni versity this paper was first presented, for their helpful comments. I also thank Geoffrey Herman, Michael Satlow, Jay Rovner, Aharon Amit, Jonathan Klawans, and David Brodsky for comments and observations. 249</page><page sequence="2">Jeffrey Jeffrey L.

He set his eyes on a certain maiden. One day he heard a voice that said, "Any slave who rebels now will succeed." [Bl] He arose and killed all of his masters. He left [only] that maiden. &lt;When that maiden saw that he wished to marry her3,&gt; She went up to the roof and raised her voice and said, "Whoever says, 'I am from the Hasmonean House' is a slave. For only that maiden (=me) was left from them, and she jumped and died." He pre served her in honey for seven years. Some say he had sex with her, and some say he did not have sex with her. He who says he had sex with her—to satisfy his [sexual] urge. He who says he did not have sex with her—why did he do that? So as to send forth a rumor (=voice) that he took in marriage the daughter of a king. [B2] He said [to himself], "Who is it who expounds [the verse], 'Be sure to set as king over yourself one of your own people; [you must not set a foreigner over you, one who is not your kinsman]' [Deuteronomy 17:15]? The sages!" He arose and killed all of the sages and left Bava b. Buta to take advice from him. He bedecked him with a crown of hedgehog [bristles] and poked out his eyes. One day he [Herod] came and sat before him [Bava. b. Buta]. He [Herod] said to him, "Do you see, Sir, this evil slave—what he does?" (He said to him), "What can I do to him?" He [Herod] said to him, "Curse him." He said to him, "It is written, 'Don't revile a king even among your intimates' [Kohelet 10:20]." (He [Herod] said to him), "This applies to a king. But that one is no king." (He said to him,) "Even if he is only a rich man, as is written, '[Don't revile] a rich man even in your bedchamber' [Kohelet 10:20]. And even if his is only a noble, as is written, 'Do not put a curse upon a chieftain among your people' [Exodus 22:27]." [Herod] said to him, "[That verse applies] to one who acts in accord with the ways of your people, but this one does not act in accord with the ways of your people." He said to him, "I am afraid lest there be another man who would hear something and go and inform him." (He [Herod] said to him,) Now, however, there is no other man with us who might go and tell." He said to him, '"For a bird of the air may carry the utterance, and a winged creature may report the word' [Kohelet 10:20]." He [Herod] said to him, "It is I! Had I known that the sages were so discreet, I would not have killed you all. Now what is the remedy for that man (=me)?" He said to him, "He extinguished the light of the world. Let him go and busy himself with the light of the world. He extinguished the light of the world—the sages, as is written, 'For the commandment is a lamp; the Torah is a light' [Pro verbs 6:23], Let him go and busy himself with the light of the world—the temple, as is written, 'And all the nations shall be illumined by it [=the temple]' [Isaiah 2:2]." Some say he [Bava b. Buta] said to him thus: "He extinguished the eye of the world. Let him go and busy himself with the eye of the world. 3. So MSS Escorial and Paris, and the printings.

He [Herod] said to him, "I am afraid of the Kingdom of Rome." He said to him, "Send a messenger. He will travel for a year, and stay there for a year, and return for a year. Meanwhile &lt;raze it and&gt; build it." [C] &lt;He did so .&gt; They [the Romans] sent to him, "If you have not razed it, do not raze it. And if you have razed it, do not build it. And if you have razed it and built it, then you are an evil slave who consults after he has [already] acted. Although your weapons are with you, your book [of genealogy] is here. You are not a king [rekha], nor the son of a king [bar rekha], but Herod, &lt;a slave&gt; who made himself a freeman."4 [appendix a'] How do we know that this word "rekha [rex]" is the language of kingship? As is written, "I am weak (rakh) even though appointed king" [2 Samuel 3:39]. And some say [from here], "And they cried before him Avrekh"Avrekh"Avrekh" [Genesis 41:43], and we translate [in the Aramaic Targum ],father of the the king. [appendix b'] They said: He who never saw the building of Herod never saw a beautiful building. With what did he build it? With stones of alabaster and marble. Some say with stones of alabaster, stibnite, and marble. One row went in and one went out so that it could be plastered. He [Herod] thought of covering it with gold. The sages said to him, "Leave it alone, as it is more beautitul thus, as it looks like the waves of water." Before discussion of the background of the story, a few comments on the story's literary dimension are necessary. Yonatan Feintuch has published an excel lent and comprehensive literary analysis of the story in this journal, so a brief treat ment of the story's principal themes will suffice here.5 The story can be divided into four scenes, A, Bl, B2, C, and viewed in terms of a loose chiastic structure. In the first scene, Herod, a Hasmonean slave, hears a voice, apparently some sort of revelation, that the time is auspicious for rebellion. In the second (Bl), Herod revolts and kills the Hasmoneans, with the exception of one princess, and takes over as king. His efforts to marry the Hasmonean princess, however, are unsuc cessful. In the third scene (B2), Herod kills the sages, whom he believes to be another group opposing his kingship, with the exception of one sage, 4. The meaning of this last line is not completely clear, in part because of the difficulty of under standing the word kalanya here. Feintuch, "External Appearance," 90, translates: "Though your weapon is on you, your genealogical record, however, is here in our archives, in which it can be seen that you are not a king [rekha], nor a descendant of a king. (It is recorded): 'Herod, the servant, has made himself free.'" 5. Feintuch, "External Appearance," who also deals with the complex question of the contex tualization of the story at the beginning of tractate Bava Batra. See too Feintuch, "Ma'asei hakhamim," 14-32; A. A. Halevy, Sha'arei ha-'aggadah (Tel Aviv: Guttenberg, 1963), 180-90; Richard Kalmin, Jewish Jewish Babylonia between Persia and Roman Palestine (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 50-53. 252</page><page sequence="5">King Herod in Ardashir's Court Bava b. Buta. He finds, however, after blinding and testing Bava, that the sages are more discreet than he had anticipated and asks for a penance, which Bava sets as the building of the temple, and advises Herod how to circumvent Roman opposi tion. In the final scene (C), the Romans indeed rebuke Herod for his disloyalty, reminding him of his true origins as a slave. Two appendices follow, one dealing with the meaning of a term, the second praising the beauty of the temple. On one level the story grapples with the question of how a usurping, mur derous, villainous king could have had the merit of rebuilding the glorious Jeru salem temple.6 The storytellers' strategy here is to minimize the credit due Herod by claiming that: (1) the rebuilding was not owing to Herod's righteousness or commitment to God but, quite the opposite, to his wickedness, namely as penance for his sins;7 (2) the idea and initiative to rebuild the temple were not Herod's, but the sage Bava b. Buta's; (3) the task was only accomplished because of the wisdom of Bava b. Buta, who advised Herod how to outwit the Romans; and finally (4) Herod even contemplated reducing the beauty of the temple by covering it with gold, until the sages informed him that this would actu ally detract from the temple's beauty (appendix b). Second, the story attempts to undermine Herod's status as king through a series of narrative reversals. Most importantly, Herod attempts to become king but in the end remained a slave, as the Romans—the real kings—pronounce, reminding Herod of his place (C). Thus the story begins by describing Herod a slave of the Hasmonean House, and ends with the Roman's stating the same. Herod's other stratagems likewise fail to accomplish their purposes. He "set his eyes"8 on a maiden either for sex or to marry into the king's family and legitimate his reign. But her suicide and public proclamation foil both goals and emphasize Herod's servile status. Herod kills the sages, but then finds that it was a mistake to do so. In this way the story tellers explain how such a sinful king could succeed at building the magnificent temple, while at the same time they deny him credit and emphasize the illegiti macy of his royal claims, as his true status as slave could not be masked. The Josephan Influence Almost every scholar who has commented on the issue considers the rabbi nic stoiy heavily indebted to Josephus.9 Daniel Schwartz has aptly summarized both the connections to, and discrepancies from, the Josephan account. He notes: 6. Halevy, Sha 'arei ha- 'aggadah, 180. 7. Cf. Bamidbar Rabbah 14:8: . .the Temple Herod built, built by a sinful king, and its building was atonement (kapparah) for killing the sages." 8. On the motifs of sight and hearing see Feintuch, "External Appearance," 98-100. 9. E.g. Tal Ilan, Mine and Yours Are Hers: Retrieving Women s History from Rabbinic Literature (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 153. After quoting the beginning of the story, Ilan comments: "With the exception of one scholar, all agree that this is the talmudic version of the complex and tragic marriage between Herod and the Hasmonean princess Mariamme, which is described in great detail by Josephus." Ilan even goes so far as to suggest that since Josephus describes Herod crying out for Mariamme and "utter ing unseemly laments" (Ant. 15.240-2), then "why not imagine further, that Herod refused to part with Mariamme, and thus had her body preserved so that he could gaze upon her. And if that were so, 253</page><page sequence="6">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein Looking back at this long account, we first note that the main lines of the story are correct: Herod did begin his career as a servant of the Hasmoneans, he did rise to power by replacing them, he did marry a Hasmonean princess, she did die in confrontation with him, he did build the Second Temple. Moreover, it is also clear that this talmudic narrative contains some echoes of the very specific events of that story. Thus ... if the Talmud reports that Mariamme killed herself by jumping off a roof, Josephus {Ant. 17.71) reports the same of the wife of Herod's brother, Pheroras. ... The Talmudic story of Herod secretly approaching Baba ben Buta and testing to see if he would curse the king is paralleled by Josephus' report, in Ant. 15.367, that Herod used to snoop around incognito and listen to his subjects talking about him.10 In other words, together with direct parallels, some elements of the talmudic story, though they do not correspond directly to Josephus's account, seem to be based on other passages in Josephus, which contribute to the claim that the rabbinic story has a prominent Josephan influence. At the same time, Schwartz duly notes the contradictions with Josephus's account: Namely, it is obvious that there is much which is wrong, historically, in the rabbinic story. Thus, none of us would consent to replace Josephus' story of Mariamme's trial and execution by the talmudic suicide story, none of us can imagine Herod going on and trading verses with a blind sage, none of us would consent to replacing Josephus' account {Ant. 15.420—421), which says the Temple was built in nine and a half years, with that of the rabbis which says it was built within three." However, I think that these efforts by Schwartz and others to find direct parallels to Josephus, what Schwartz calls the "correct" lines of the story, can be questioned. Schwartz claims, for example, that Herod "did marry a Hasmonean princess and she did die in confrontation with him." But in the rabbinic story he does not marry her, and she dies by suicide, not because Herod ordered her death. That Herod "did rise to power by replacing" the Hasmoneans, as Schwartz puts it, does not exactly correspond to the massacre recounted in the Talmud. Schwartz's additional con nections to other Josephan passages are likewise not probative: The wife of Pher oras, according to Josephus, did not in fact die, but survived her jump from the roof.12 In any case, suicide by jumping off the roof is a common Bavli narrative motif, attested of a Roman officer in B. Ta'anit 29b, the laundryman who failed to call on R. Yehudah Ha-Nasi on the day of his death in B. Ketubot 103b, the heretic perhaps he also violated the corpse, or perhaps rumor had it that he did." This attempt at "reading-in" is extreme, but illustrates the general scholarly tendency to read the two stories in light of one another. 10. Daniel R. Schwartz, "Herod in Ancient Jewish Literature," in The World of the Herods, ed. Nikos Kokkinos (Stuttgart: Fran Steiner, 2007), 48. 11. 11. Schwartz, "Herod in Ancient Jewish Literature," 49. 12.

Hullin 87a, and the mother and father of a slain child in B. Hullin 94a. So there is little reason to see that Josephan passage about the wife of Pheroras as the source of the maiden's suicide, which is a stock motif available in other Bavli anecdotes. Eli Yassif, adopting a more folkloristic perspective, mentions the Josephan comiection in a looser manner: This legend is a typical mixture of three elements: a historical grain of truth (shored up by other sources: Josephus, Roman historians), in Herod's persecu tion of the Hasmoneans, his marriage to a daughter of that family and her suicide, and his massive renovations on the Temple Mount. The second com ponent is the folk narrative motifs, such as the immersion of corpses in honey, necrophilia, and the king who conceals his identity from a blind man. The third element at work in this legend is connected with the sages' worldview: the sages were always the first to come to harm, as they were the people's representatives.'3 It is easier to accept this perspective, which places less emphasis on specific passages and more weight on the general contours of the story derived from Josephus among other historians, narrative elements which probably circulated and metamorphosed in oral form for centuries thereafter. Yassif is on target in char acterizing the "historical" dimension of the Bavli account as a "grain of truth," (with an emphasis on the "grain"). The addition of "folk narrative motifs" seems indisputable, and the rabbinocentric tendencies are indeed typical. Yet once we concede that the Josephan substratum is minimal and deviations from Josephus are prominent, the question arises as to other sources of the Bavli tradition. A. A. Halevi has noted that the Herod story appears only in the Bavli and nowhere in Palestinian sources.14 And J. N. Epstein suggested that the custom of preserving corpses in honey is Babylonian, citing Herodotus's observation that the Babylonians bury their dead in honey.15 Herodotus also mentions a Persian custom of preserving bodies in wax, claiming that, "the Persians cover 13. Eli Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning (Bloomington: Indiana Univer sity Press, 1999), 141-42. Yassif s mention of the suicide among the items containing a "grain of truth" is puzzling. Neither Josephus, nor other historians to the best of my knowledge, claim Mariamme com mitted suicide. 14. Halevy, Sha'arei ha-'aggadah, 180. 15. Herodotus, Histories, 1:198; Jacob Nahum Epstein, Mavo le-sifrut ha-'amoraim (Jerusa lem: Magnes; Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1962), 198. However, Halevy, Sha'arei ha-'aggadah, 181 n. 6, quotes other classical authors and claims that burial in honey or wax in order to preserve the body was found elsewhere too. He also notes that Josephus mentions that the body of Aristobolus II was pre served in honey (Ant. 14.124; a datum often mentioned by scholars who argue the Bavli story is indebted to Josephus). On burial in honey in antiquity, see also Wallis E. Budge, A History of Egypt from from the End of the Neolithic Period to the Death of Cleopatra VII (London: Kegan Paul, 1902), 155; Eva Crane, The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting (New York: Routledge, 1999), 538-39. 255</page><page sequence="8">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein corpses in wax before burying them in the ground."1" The sources of the story, then, should perhaps be sought among Sasanian traditions in addition to Josephus.17 Sasanian Sources Traditions of the rise of Ardashir, founder of the Sasanian dynasty, which may have influenced the Bavli story of Herod, have been preserved in a number of Sasanian sources. These include: (1) The Karnamag i Ardashir i Pabagan,Pabagan, (The Book of the Deeds of Ardashir Son of Pabag [Papak, Babag]), a Pahlavi text probably composed in the sixth century CE on the basis of earlier traditions.18 Like other Pahlavi texts, the extant version postdates the Muslim conquest. Scholars have characterized this account as a "romance" and as "popular."19 (2) The Xwaday-namag (Khvaday-namag) (The Books of Kings), an official court history of the Sasanian dynasty probably assembled from earlier materials during the reign of Xusro (Kosrow) I (Anushirwan; 531-579), and revised and updated by his successors.20 The original Xwaday-namag itself 16. Herodotus, Histories, 1:140; see Margaret Warner Morley, The Honey-makers (reprint, Chicago: A.C. McClurg, 1899), 257. 17. The Latin (?) terms, rekha = rex, king, and kalanya = colonia, freeman, in the Romans' rebuke should not be taken as evidence of the story's origin in the classical world rather than in Baby Ionia. The etymology of rekha is disputed: Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic Aramaic (Ramat-Gan; Baltimore: Bar Ilan University Press; Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), 1084, states that the etymology is unknown. Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionaiy of the Targumim, the Talmud Talmud Babli, and Yerushalmi and the Midrashic Literature (reprint, New York: Jastrow Publishers, 1967), 1474, gives a Hebrew etymology (granted that Jastrow's semiticizing bias is well known). Samuel Krauss, Griechische und Lateinische Lehnworter im Talmud, Midrasch und Targum (1898 99; reprint, Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1964), 579, in fact derives it from the Persian aryaka, as does Epstein, Mavo le-sifrut ha-'amoraim, 199; but see Bernhard Geiger's note to Samuel Krauss, TosafotTosafot he-'arukh ha-shalem (New York: Pardes, 1937), 383. Because Targum Onkelos, as the Talmud itself notes (section a') translates 'avrekh (Genesis 41:43) as "father of the king" "abba de-malka'),de-malka'), the meaning was available to the Bavli storytellers. They created verisimilitude by attribut ing a foreign-sounding term to the Romans, rather than having the Romans use the word malka or such like. And even if we do take it as a transliteration of the Latin rex, this word was probably so commonly known that it is no surprise that Bavli storytellers would have employed it in Active Roman speech. The term kalanva appears elsewhere in the Bavli (B. Sukkah 45a, B. Avodah Zarah 10a; though with slightly different meaning), and was therefore also available to Bavli storytellers. 18.1 have used the edition of Frantz Grenet, La Geste D 'Ardashir Fils de Pabag: Karnamag T ArdaxserArdaxser JPabagan (Die: Editions A.

A brief summary of the beginning of the account in Karnamag i Ardashir i PabaganPabagan is as follows: Pabag, a nobleman and the governor of Fars, has auspicious dreams about his shepherd Sasan, a descendant of the old Persian kings,23 and gives Sasan his daughter in marriage. She gives birth to a son, Ardashir, whom Pabag adopts and educates. King Ardawan (Ardawan IV / Artabanus IV) hears of the young Ardashir's exquisite talents and equestrian ability, and summons Ardashir to his court to join his retinue. During a hunting expedition Ardashir quarrels with Ardawan's son, when the prince claims to have shot an antelope that Ardashir in fact killed. Ardawan sides with his son and reprimands Ardashir, and then rele gates him to the stables to take care of the horses. This naturally embitters Ardashir and kindles resentment toward the royal family. Some time thereafter, Ardawan consults with his astrologers and sooth sayers about what they see in the stars. He receives an ominous response: Then the chief of the soothsayers came forward, and said: It is so revealed that, whichever servant (bandag mard) who will escape from his master within three days from today, will reach greatness and sovereignty, and will become successful and victorious over his own master.24 Orientaliste Paul Geuthner, 1936), 59-62; Shahpur Shahbazi, "On the Xwaday-Namag," Acta Iranica: Papers Papers in Honor ofProfessor Ehsan Yarshater 16 (1990): 218-33.

In the Shahnameh, the astrologers state: "A servant who was valiant and of noble birth would flee from his court, and this man would become a great king, a ruler of the world, powerful and blessed by the stars" (Davis, trans., Shahnameh, 535; Mohl, trans., Le Livre des Rois, 5:285).

She had become enamored of Ardashir and fallen in love with him. She informs Ardashir of the astrologers' words. The two take a pair of fine horses and flee. Ardawan discovers his slave girl is missing, hears of their flight, pursues them, but cannot overtake them, and returns home after three days. Ardashir gathers allies, raises an army, and fights a series of battles, eventually killing Ardawan and other members of the royal family, and marrying his daughter. After making more alliances and fighting additional battles he becomes King of Kings, inaugurating the Sasanian dynasty. One can immediately recognize the beginning of the Herod story in this Sasanian text, which, after transforming and condensing from written to oral form, could briefly be summarized along the lines of the Bavli story as: "Ardashir was a servant of the House of Ardawan. One day he heard of a voice saying that whoever rebels now against his masters will succeed. He arose and killed many of his masters, and spared one maiden."26 In other words, I suggest that the rabbis understood the transition from the Hasmonean to Herodian dynasties through the prism of the transition from the Parthian (Arsacid) to Sasanian dynasties. They identified Herod with Ardashir, and constructed a story of Herod's usurpation and rise to power on the basis of Ardashir's usurpation and rise to power as recounted in Sasanian sources. Here are the particulars of the two accounts in more detail. (1) Herod was a Servant of the Hasmonean House: It is clear that Ardashir can be characterized as a "servant of Ardawan" or "a servant of the House of Ardawan," exactly as the Bavli states of Herod vis-a-vis the Hasmoneans. This Nationale, 1900], 477.) In the Greek additions to the Armenian historian Agathangelos, History of the Armenians,Armenians, 3-9, Ardawan himself observes the stars and tells his wife, "I observed the course of a star and I have inferred today the following, that if someone wished to rebel against his own master and to make war upon him, on the present occasion he would win and his master be defeated," and the maid servant subsequently tells Ardashir, "For the king has seen the course of the stars and said, 'Now a slave working against his master gains the victory upon the present occasion.'" See Guy Lafontaine, La Version Version grecque ancienne du livre armenien d'Agathange (Louvain: Peeters Lafontaine, 1973), 173 77; translation from Dodgeon and Lieu, The Roman Frontier, 9. On this version, see Gohar Muradyan, and Aram Topchyan, "The Romance of Artaban and Artasir in Agathangelos's Historye-Sasanika 4 (2008) http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/eSasanika4-topchyan.pdf. 25.25. Grenet, La Geste D 'Ardashir, 66. 26.26. The connection between the opening of the Herod narrative and this tradition of the Kama mag mag was noted by Geoffrey Herman in a lecture presented at Bar-Ilan University in November, 2004. That we came to this conclusion independently supports the contention that the rabbinic account was patterned upon the Sasanian tradition. 258</page><page sequence="11">King Herod in Ardashir's Court can be said fairly of Ardashir's initial position in the king's retinue, where he is a vassal or attendant. His subsequent demotion to the stables is a clear indication of servitude. Geoffrey Herman has shown, based in part on talmudic evidence, that the stable master was near the bottom of the hierarchy of positions in the royal administration, and evidently considered among the baser forms of service.27 Moreover, Ardashir understands the astrologers' prognostication of a "servant who will escape from his master" to be applicable to himself. The version of this scene in the Shahnameh depicts Ardashir's relegation to servitude in the stables more explicitly: Ardawan commands Ardashir: "Go! Look after my Arab horses and keep your place in the stables. Be a groom in the stalls and assist ant to any man at any task. Ardashir, his eyes running tears, thus came to be the groom in the stalls and assistant to any man at any task."28 And after Ardashir writes to his father of the unhappy turn of events, Pabag writes back in rebuke: "Why did you thrust yourself ahead of his sons? You are his attendant, not his kinsman." Apart from this account of the Karnamag that claims that Ardashir des cended from the old Persian kings and that his grandfather Pabag was an aristocrat, there seems to have existed a different "popular" tradition of Ardashir's origins preserved in Byzantine sources. According to this tradition Ardashir emerged from society's lower classes. Thus the seventh-century historian and poet George Pisida (a.k.a. George the Pisidian), writes in his poem, "The Heracliados," about the Roman emperor Heraclius's campaign against the Persians in 622: For they say that Artaser (i.e. Ardashir), being a slave by station [onta doulon teintein tuxein\, with his despotic and arrogant sword, removed the Parthians from their former (share of) power to the captive throne which he had seized and is now enthroning Persia again in evil.29 Similarly, the sixth-century Byzantine historian Agathias Scholasticus, in his work "On the Sasanians," writes of Ardashir as "at first obscure and undistinguished."30 27. Herman, "Ahasuerus, the Former Stable Master," 288-92. 28. Davis, trans., Shahnameh, 256. 29. George Pisida, Heracliados 11.173-177; see Agostino Pertusi, Georgio di Pisidio i. Pane giricigirici epici (Ettal: Buch-Kunstverlag, 1959), 259. English translation from Dodgeon and Lieu, The Roman Roman Frontier, 12. However, tem tuxein, translated as "by station," probably an accusative of respect, can simply mean "by fortune" or "by happenstance," i.e., who happened to be a slave. J. P. Migne, "Heracliados, Acr. II," Patrologia Graeca 92 (Paris, 1875): 1328, offers: "Quippe Arta sarem, quie fuit servus origine, per vim atque audacium ferunt stride ense, ab eius, cui suberant, potes tate Parthis abductis ad servilem, quem arripit, thronum, rursus in malis locasse thronum Persidis." In the Greek additions to Agathangelos, Artavan tells Ardashir that "it would be much more preferable for him to die than to concede his kingdom to Artasiras (=Ardashir), who was slave." (Translation from Muradyan and Topchyan, "The Romance of Artaban and Artasir," reconstructed from later witnesses.) 30. "A certain Persian called Artaxares (=Ardashir), at first obscure (adoxos) and undistin guished (aphanestatos), but able and energetic all the same, and good at instigating disturbance, gath ered together a band of fellow conspirators and made an attack, killing the king, Artabanus (=Ardawan)." Section 122B, cited from Cameron, "Agathias on the Sassanians," 86, 156. Cf. 124B: 259</page><page sequence="12">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein According to Arthur Christensen, this popular version stems from the tendency of the folk to see rulers emerge from lower-class or common origins.31 Thus the description of Herod as a servant/slave ('avda) of the Hasmonean dynasty closely parallels the traditions of Ardashir as a servant of Ardawan and the Parthian House, whether we follow the version of the Karnamag,Karnamag, where Ardashir was an aristocratic vassal relegated to servitude in the stables, or the popular version attested among Byzantine authors, where Ardashir was originally a slave. The description also dovetails to some extent both with rabbinic traditions concerning the genealogical status of Herod's descen dants and with Josephus's account that Herod's father Antipas was a Hasmonean vassal, although Josephus himself apparently considered Herod to be fully Jewish.32 (2) The voice Herod Hears that Inspires him to Rebel: The Vilna printing of the Talmud reads that Herod heard a bat kala (bat kol). However, the evidence from the manuscripts and early printings is divided: "It is said that Artaxares' mother was married to a certain Pabak, who was quite obscure (pantapasi men men aseimotato),aseimotato), a leather worker by trade, but very learned in astrology and easily able to discern the future." 31. Christensen, Les gestes des rois, 81. See too, Cameron, "Agathias on the Sassanians," 107 09: "Agathias is here reflecting the popular tradition about Ardasher, which emphasized his lowly origins The Khvadhaynamagh version, on the other hand, traced his descent to the Avesta saga-kings and the Achaemenid dynasty." And see Herman, "Ahasuerus, the Former Stable Master of of Belshazzar," 289 n. 35. 32. The traditions of King Agrippa, a descendant of Herod, weeping upon reading the Deutero nomic passage about the laws of the king, only to be reassured by the people "You are our brother," suggest there was some suspicion of Agrippa's yihus, which could be related to that of his ancestor Herod (M. Sotah 7:8 and elsewhere). However, there need be no necessary connection between the genealogical status of Agrippa and Herod, as the relevant factor for each, in the rabbinic view (at least what emerges as the rabbinic view), would have been the status of the mother (cf. the commen tariestaries to M. Sotah 7:8, andTosafot, B. BavaBatra3b, s.v. kol). Josephus himself considered Herod to be Jewish; see Shaye J.D. Cohen, The Beginnings ofJewishness (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 13-24; Albert Baumgarten, "Kesheirutam shelhurdos u-vnei beito ke-malkhei yisra,el," in Jews and and Judaism in the Second Temple, Mishna and Talmud Period: Studies in Honor ofShmuel Safrai, ed. Isaiah Gafiii, et al. (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi, 1993), 31-37. However, since Josephus relates that Herod's mother was an Arab, a rabbinic reading of Josephus would deem Herod a gentile (though not necess arily a slave). The crucial question is what the sages knew of Herod's parentage. Note that Rabbenu Gershom, to B. Bava Batra 3b, relates that Hyrkanos, Herod's father (!), married a "captive woman" after one of his successful campaigns against the Romans (!), and Herod descended from this union, inheriting the status of slave from the mother. (So the version included in the Vilna printing of the Talmud. In a version published from a manuscript, Peirush Rabbenu Gershom ha-shalem 'al masekhet bava bava batra, ed. Tzvi Leitner [Jerusalem, 1998], 8, the claim is that, although the "captive woman" became Jewish in the appropriate way, people insulted Herod by recalling his provenance. I am grateful to Yehoshua Rabinowitz for referring me to the manuscript version.) This effort to explain why the Bavli calls Herod a slave suggests to me that rabbinic tradition (at least the tradition Rabbenu Gershom inherited) did not know of Josephus's account of Herod's ancestry. Evidence from the med ieval Sefer Yosifon suggests the same; the author calls Herod "a slave/servant of our house" ('eved bei teinu, chap. 43:147). See Sefer Yosiphon, ed. David Flusser (Jerusalem: Bialik, 1978), 1:190, 2:115. 260</page><page sequence="13">King Herod in Ardashir's Court mxi x^p ra fom xinn yaw Vilna printing naxp7 mryaw Escorial Niaxp mm K*?p yaw Florence '-laup mm s^p yaw Munich main xVp na yaw Paris 'asp mm a1??

The Vatican manuscript and the Vilna printing offer a conflation of the two (in MS Vatican a scribe has crossed out ha-hu gavra and inserted a superlinear bat). Of the readings kala and bat kala, it seems that kala is original, as one can easily see how kala would have been changed by scribes to the more familiar bat kala,kala, but not why bat kala would be altered to the vague and indefinite kala (and it is unlikely that the word bat was accidentally omitted.33) Moreover, a bat kala proclaiming such a general and indefinite opportunity ("Every slave who rebels now ...") is unusual, if not unattested, as bat kols in the Bavli typically have a more specific target or audience. The closest parallel I can find is the bat kol heard after R. Yehudah Ha-Nasi's death, "Whoever was present ... is designated for the world to come." But even this bat kol applies only to those present, not to anyone who takes the specified action.34 Furthermore, if this is a bat kol, we have to ask why a bat kol, which generally discloses elements of the divine will as a sort 33. I have not carried out a comprehensive study of variants of bat kol/kala and kol/kala, but a check of a few instantiations suggests that such variants are rare. T. Sotah 13:5-6 reports of occasions when Yohanan the High Priest and Simon the Righteous heard a word/speech (davar) from the Holy of Holies, which becomes a kol in MS Munich and Vatican of B. Sotah 33a, and a bat kol in the Vilna printing, and also a bat kol in Y. Sotah 9:14 (24b) (I thank the anonymous reviewer for this reference.) In B. Bava Mezia 84b, MSS Escorial, Hamburg, Vatican, and Munich 95 read kala, while Florence reads bat kala. However this kala is the voice that emanates from the upper story where R. Eleazar b. R. Shimon's corpse remained unburied for years. Hence it is not the typical heavenly bat kol, and here too the original reading of kol seems to have been changed by the scribe of MS Florence to bat kol.kol. See too Kristen Lindbeck, Elijah and the Rabbis: Story and Theology (New York: Columbia Uni versity Press, 2010), 58-59. 34. To cope with this difficulty, the commentary 'Iyyun ya 'akov, in 'Ein ya 'akov, ad 10c., suggests that Herod alone heard the bat kol, and it was directed to him alone. But the text reads "Any slave" (kol 'avda). 261</page><page sequence="14">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein of prophecy, would make such an announcement: how does the rogue Herod's rebellion against the Hasmoneans accord with the divine will? (a problem which bothered Nahmanides and other medieval commentators).35 If the reading kala is original, however, we are left with the questions: what kind of kalakala—voice, or rumor, or report—is this, why would Herod trust it, and why would it prove true?36 The reading of MS Escorial and the first printings, "he heard them say" or "he heard a certain man say" presents the same difficulty: why "listen to this talk, and why did it in fact come true? However, if the Bavli storytellers here mean to emulate the Sasanian account, then these problems dis appear: Herod hears the voice or sayings of astrologers and soothsayers analogous to Ardashir. Or, to put it in slightly different words: the rabbinic storytellers are attempting to mirror the Sasanian story where the astrologers' kol, based on the configuration of the stars, inspires the usurper to rebel. This conclusion is bolstered by the reading found in Haggadot ha-talmud and a manuscript of the Yalkut Shim 'oni, which read: "He heard the Chaldeans (=astrologers) saying" (37.(שמע לכלז־אי דקאמרי Now it is always difficult to figure out the provenance of the readings found in Haggadot ha-talmud and their relationship to the manuscripts of the Bavli, although some recent work suggests that this compilation preserves early and original readings.38 If this reading is orig inal, we could conjecture a development along the lines of: (Haggadot(Haggadot ha-talmud, Yalkut MS) 1] שמע לכלדאי וקאמרי] (reconstructed) 1*] שמע דקאמרי] (Escorial) 2ב] שמע לקאמרי -&gt; שמעינהו דקאמרי] (Pesaro, Venice printings) 2א] שמע לקאמרי -&gt; שמע לההוא גברא לקאמרי] (Munich, Florence) 2ג] שמע לקאמרי-&gt; שמע קלא לקאמרי // שמע קלא להוה קאמרא] 35. Nahmanides to Genesis 49:10 explains that the Hasmonean dynasty was punished and replaced because they too were illegitimate rulers, as a legitimate monarch must be a member of the tribe of Judah and House of David. Of course this explanation raises the question of why Herod received divine favor to succeed them; see David Abudarham, Sefer Abudarham ha-shalem (Jerusalem: Usha, 1963), 201. 36. If the term kala is synonymous with bat kala, we are back to the questions above. 37. These readings are mentioned in Raphael Rabbinovicz, Dikdukei soferim (reprint, New York, 1960), to B. Bava Batra 3b, n. resh. See too Haggadot ha-talmud (Jerusalem, 1961 [Con stantinople, 1511 ]), 88b. This reading was clearly in the manuscript of the author, as he glosses kalda 'i with "those who gaze upon the stars" (שמע לכלדאי פי' החוזים בכוכבים). I have not yet tracked down the YalkutYalkut reading myself. Rabbinovicz refers to a manuscript of Yalkut Shim 'oni to Haggai. (Printings, including the first printing [Salonika, 1526], lack the text of the story here.) He does not say which manuscript, but apparently he means Parma codex 1172, as Aharon Hyman, Mekorot yalkut shimoni (Jerusalem: Rav Kook, 1965), 2:xxiv, mentions that the Parma manuscript adds two traditions at the end of Haggai, after paragraph 568, which do not appear in the printings (see too Hyman's comments, pp. 5-6). On this manuscript, see Jacob Z. Lauterbach, "The Yalkut Ha-Makhiri on Hosea and Michah," in Occident and Orient: Moses Gaster Anniversary Volume, ed. Bruno Schindler (London: Taylor and Sons, 1936), 368. 38.

The reading kala was changed to the more familiar bat kala, in Paris. We find a conflation of the readings bat kala and ha-hu gavra gavra in the Vatican manuscript and the Vilna printing, the traces of which one can still see in Vatican where ha-hu gavra is crossed out in place of kala, and the bat added superlinearly.40 But this is only a conjecture, owing to the uncertainty regarding the prove nance of these versions, which are not found in the Talmud manuscripts them selves.41 It is also possible that the reading kalda'i (Chaldean) simply reflects a different oral version deriving from early times. And perhaps we should also con sider the possibility that kala de- 'a(mar) (a voice that said), was a corruption of kalda kalda 'i during the period of oral transmission, as the pronunciation of the ק and כ were no longer distinguishable. But whatever the source of the reading in Hag gadotgadot ha-talmud and the Yalkut manuscript, the parallel to the Sasanian tradition is stunning. We can safely say that this reading accurately reflects the background of the narrative: Herod heard the astrologers disclose that the time is auspicious for any slave who rebels against his masters to succeed. As in the Sasanian accounts, these astrologers have read the stars accurately. (3) Herod killing the entire Hasmonean House: The Bavli account states that, "He [Herod] arose and killed all of his masters. He left [only] that maiden." In the Karnamag Ardashir does not kill all of the House of Ardawan. He kills Ardawan and marries his daughter, but he imprisons two of Ardawan's sons while two others escape and subsequently write to their sister, urging her to poison Ardashir.42 However, in Tabari's version, perhaps deriving from the Xwaday-namag,Xwaday-namag, as opposed to this more romantic version of the Karnamag, Arda shir indeed kills off all of Ardawan's kin, sparing only one maiden: 39.

It is also possible that the version in Haggadot ha-talmud represents an effort to interpret and clarify the vague Icala or the ha-hu gavra of the manuscripts. If so, I think the scribe accurately explicated the story! 42. A similar account of the flight of two sons to India and attempt at poisoning appears in Shah nameh\nameh\ see Davis, trans., Shahnameh, 541-42, 554-57. Dio Cassius, Roman History, 80.3.1-2, men tions that Ardashir fought three battles against the Parthians and killed the king, Artabus. A rock relief at Naqsh-e Rustam shows Ardashir on his horse standing over Ardawan's corpse; see Christensen, L'Iran sous les Sassanides, 91. 263</page><page sequence="16">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein When Ardashirb. Babak had attained royal power, he wrought great slaughter among the Arsacids (al-Ashakaniyyah), to whom belonged the "Party Kings," until he exterminated them, in accordance with an oath which Sasan the elder, son of Ardashir, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, the ancestor of Ardashir b. Babak, had sworn: that, if at some point, he should attain royal power, he would not spare a single one of the progeny of Ashak, son of Khurrah.... Hence Ardashir massacred the Arsacids en bloc, women and menfolk alike, not sparing a single one of them ... It is mentioned that he left no one alive except a maiden whom he had found in the royal palace. He was struck by her beauty and asked her - she was really the slaughtered king's daughter—about her origins.43 Thus different accounts circulated as to the fate of Ardawan's extended family. Tabari offers the neat and tidy story of complete annihilation (with the exception of one daughter), which is of course a standard plot of folk narratives. The Bavli's story of Herod coheres with this version. (4) Herod and the Hasmonean Maiden: Here the two accounts deviate, although there is enough in common to argue for the rabbinic story's dependence on the Sasanian tradition. In the Karnamag it is the maiden who falls in love with Ardashir and who hears the astrologers. Thus the rabbinic story would be more parallel if it read: "One day a certain maiden set her eyes on him. She heard a voice saying ..." However, Ardashir returns the maiden's love (and promises to make her queen) and hears of the astrologers' report from her, so the rabbinic account is not too far off. A A second divergence is of course the fact that Ardashir marries Ardawan's daughter—or in other versions of the tradition, Ardawan's niece or another female relative—and she eventually gives birth to Shapur, the next emperor, whereas the Hasmonean maiden commits suicide, and Herod must content himself with a sticky corpse.44 This difference is a product of the divergent—indeed opposite —purposes of the storytellers. The authors of the Karnamag and Xwaday-namag write to glorify and legitimate the Sasanian dynasty. Hence the marriage to the former king's daughter and offspring with both Sasanian and Arsacid blood. Fir dowsi, in the Shahnameh version, hits us over the head with this idea: "Then Sabak came before Ardashir and said, 'Wise king, demand Ardavan's daughter in marriage: she has splendor and beauty and the dignity of station. The crown will be in your hands."'45 The rabbinic storytellers, by contrast, mean to dishonor 43. Bosworth, trans., The History of al-Tabari, 23-24. However, see Yarshater, "Iranian National History," 476-77, who suggests that Tabari's account of Ardashir's early career may not have derived from the Xwaday-namag. 44. On the female relative of Ardawan, see Christensen, L 'Iran sous les Sassanides, 88-89; Yar shater, "Iranian National History," 380; and see Edward G. Browne, "Some Account of the Arabic Work Entitled 'Nihayatu 'l-irab fi akhbari 'I-Furs wa 'I- 'Arab,' Particularly of that Part which Treats of the Persian Kings," Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1900): 218, where she is a cousin. 45. Davis, trans., Shahnameh, 542. 264</page><page sequence="17">King Herod in Ardashir's Court Herod, delegitimize his claims to the throne, and expose his attempt to mask his lower-class origins. Therefore they relate that Herod failed to marry a Hasmonean descendant—though Herod tried to create the impression that he did so—and remained a slave in the final reckoning, as the concluding Roman message makes abundantly clear. It should also be noted that the mention of Herod preserving the corpse in honey for seven years has a type of parallel in the Sasanian story, though again employed for the opposite purpose.46 In the Sasanian stories, Ardashir orders his minister to kill Ardawan's daughter, whom he had married (in the Karnamag and Shahnameh, because she tried to poison him; in Tabari, because of the oath mentioned above). She informs the minister that she is pregnant, so he sequesters her instead, and she soon gives birth to Shapur. The minister keeps her hidden for seven years, until Ardashir regrets having no son and heir, at which point the min ister produces the wife and son. Moreover, this assiduous minister takes care to castrate himself at the outset, placing his severed genitalia in a box and having Ardashir set his seal upon it, in order to remove himself from suspicion. In Tabari's version the minister hides the woman in a cellar, telling Ardashir: "I have consigned her to the bowels of the earth."47 When he then produces her and has Ardashir open the box with his genitalia, he explains, "We consigned her to the bowels of the earth, as our monarch had commanded us, and we exon erated ourselves in his sight from any guilt (i.e. by self-mutilation), lest any calumniator find any means to forge lies against her." One can make a case that the account of Herod and the maiden's corpse comprises a type of inversion of the Sasanian narrative. Ardashir marries and sires a son with a daughter (or other female relative) of the former king; Herod fails to marry or produce offspring with a Hasmonean maiden. Ardashir com mands the daughter to be killed, yet she survives; in the rabbinic story she dies, though Herod tries to create the false impression that she survives. The minister hides her "in the bowels of the earth" for seven years to create the impression that a living woman is a corpse; Herod preserves her in honey for seven years to create the impression that a corpse is a living woman. The minister castrates himself to prevent calumnies and lies that the son is not of Ardashir,s (and Arda wan's) line. The maiden kills herself for exactly the opposite purpose: to guarantee that claims of Hasmonean descent among Herod's progeny will be recognized as lies. In short, the rabbinic storytellers employ this narrative element of the Hasmo nean maiden to further their agenda: to illustrate that Herod, the slave and usurper, never became a legitimate king, neither he nor his descendants. The Sasanian storytellers employ the same narrative element in line with their purposes: to demonstrate that Ardashir, the usurper, was indeed the legitimate king, both he and his descendants, who in fact descend from the Parthian kings too.48 46.

The rabbinic uses and inversions of the Sasanian accounts lend themselves to analysis in terms of James C. Scott's notion of "hidden transcripts" in Domination and the Arts of Resistance (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), but this is not the forum for such an endeavor. 265</page><page sequence="18">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein (5) Herod Building the Temple: One purpose of the Bavli story, as noted, is to explain how the wicked Herod nevertheless performed the great mitzvah of rebuilding the glorious temple, and apparently did an excellent job of it. Temple building provides another parallel to the Karnamag, which portrays Ardashir as building fire-temples throughout the lands he conquered. Indeed, Sasanian royal ideology in general portrayed the Sasanian kings as the great defenders of Zoroas trianism, as religious monarchs who restored the true faith to the Iranian lands after the heterodox ways of the Arsacids.4'' Thus in the Karnamag, after making an alii ance with a local potentate named Banug, Ardashir "expressed gratitude to the Yazads, and there founded a district named Buxt-ardasir, and ordered to found ten Victorious Fire(-temples) over the sea (coast)."50 Again, after the battle with, and defeat of, Ardawan, "He [Ardashir] founded a city called Ardasir-xarrah, dug a large lake and brought out of it four water-courses, there established a Fire (-temple), excavated a huge mountain and made a canal, founded many villages, landed estates and inhabited places, and ordered to establish there many Victorious fires.,'5י And we find other such passages.52 The rabbinic storytellers of course told not of the multiplicity of temples of the Sasanian account but of the single Jerusalem temple. This tradition of a king, founder of a new dynasty, who dedi cated resources and energy to building temples, may have been one reason the rab binic storytellers associated Herod with Ardashir and viewed Herod's rise to power on the basis of Ardashir's ascent. Apart from temples, Ardashir is portrayed as a great builder in general, especially the builder of cities, as the quotes above attest, mentioning that Ardashir founded cities and villages, landed estates, watercourses, and a canal. Tabari lists eight large cities that Ardashir built, and mentions others too.53 The talmudic story does not feature Herod's impressive building campaigns, apart from the temple. But to the extent the rabbis preserved some historical memory of Herod's prodi gious building, they had another reason to identify him with Ardashir, and hence to model the story of Herod upon Ardashir's rise to power. (6) The Romans' Rebuke: The talmudic story concludes with the Romans rebuking Herod for building the temple without permission and reminding him, in insulting fashion, that he remains a slave. An interesting parallel appears in 49. Albert De Jong, "Sub Specie Maiestatis: Reflections on Sasanian Court Rituals," in Zoroas triantriantrian Ritual in Context, ed.

See too Christensen, L 'Iran sous les Sassanides, 96. 266</page><page sequence="19">King Herod in Ardashir's Court Tabari's account, where Ardawan, after hearing of Ardashir's rebellion and build ing activities, sends him a letter of insult: "You have presumed beyond your rank in society, and have brought down on yourself destruction, O Kurd brought up amongst the tents of the Kurds! Who gave you leave to assume the crown on your head, and per mission to seize all the territories you have assembled together and whose rules and peoples you have subdued? Who ordered you to build the city which you have founded in the desert of. . .?"■—he meant Jur—"When we allow you to go ahead and construct it, then build a city in the desert which is ten faraskhs across and call it Ram Ardashir."54 As in the rabbinic story, the rebuke is sent by emissary. Here too the incumbent power rebukes the usurper for building without permission and insists that such enterprises require prior authorization. Here too the rebuke focuses on the usur per's inferior lineage, that Ardashir "presumed beyond your rank in society." And here too there is an almost poetic insult with a repetition: "O Kurd brought up amongst the tents of the Kurds," echoing, "You are not a king [rekha], nor the son of a king." There is a difference, of course, in that the talmudic story places the rebuke in the mouths of the Romans, whereas the Sasanian account attributes it to the soon-to-be-deposed king. But this too is a function of the differ ent agendas of the storytellers. In the Sasanian tradition, Ardawan naturally rebukes the usurper, but Ardashir responds in kind, with insults of his own and a defense of his kingship. The rabbinic storytellers, on the other hand, wish to underscore Herod's failure and unworthiness, hence they conclude their account with the Romans putting Herod back in his true place, that is, a slave. (7) Herod, Bava b. Buta, and Herod's "Remedy," Takkanah: One unit of the Herod story that finds no direct parallel in the Sasanian accounts of Ardashir is the massacre of the sages and encounter with Bava b. Buta. This part of the story is probably best explained, along the lines of Eli Yassif's observations quoted above, as the sages anachronistically reading themselves back into history and, as leaders and representatives of the people, a logical target of a usurper.55 However, there may be some connection to the Sasanian accounts, though I concede that claims of influence here are far more speculative than the points noted above. The motif of the usurping king's regret and even repentance for killing appears in the Karnamag. The author relates that once when Ardashir was hunting he saw a male antelope save his female partner from Ardashir's arrows at the cost of his life, and then the female do the same to save her young. Ardashir weeps upon seeing this, moved by the animals' compassion, and explains that he is reminded "again (of) that wife, and the child that was, innocent, in the mother's 54. Bosworth, trans.. The History of al-Tabari, 11. 55. The crown of hedgehog or lizard skin is clearly a means of humiliation, like Jesus's crown of thorns. The motif is not common, but neither does it seem that the storyteller intended to play on the figure of Jesus. 267</page><page sequence="20">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein womb; and I am thoughtful and mournful of killing them, that it can be a grievous sin even concerning the soul."56 The chief of the magi asks Ardashir why he weeps and whether anything can be done as a remedy (cdrag), and then observes that "Ardasir has come to repentance (pasemanih) of that act" and informs him that he in fact spared the maiden and hid her away, because she was pregnant, as dis cussed above. Upon being presented with his son, Shapur, Ardashir "offered much thanks unto Ohrmazd the Lord" and then "ordered to set up on the same place a city called Valas-sabuhr, and established ten Victorious Fires there, and sent immense property and wealth to the House of the sacred fire."57 Here we have the king expressing regret for killing, mention of a remedy by the chief magus, and the king respond by building fire temples and dedicating immense wealth to the temple. Clearly there are important differences, as Ardashir regrets ordering the killing of his pregnant wife and fetus, which was in fact never carried out, whereas Herod regrets killing the sages, which he perpetrated. Yet there are several salient points in common: the chief magus and leading sage, Ardashir's regret for ordering his wife be killed and Herod stating he should not have killed the sages (this may be called "regret" even though the word itself is not used)58; mention of a remedy (takkanah, cdrag); and then the building and enrich ing of a temple/temples.59 In addition, the Karnamag tells of a second massacre ordered by Ardashir.60 Some time after killing Ardawan, Ardashir becomes frustrated at not being able to subdue all of Iran and secure his rule. He consults with an Indian magician or soothsayer (ked i hindigari), who informs him that he must intermarry with the family of Mihrag in order to establish complete rule over Iran. This infuriates Ardashir, who orders the entire family of Mihrag to be killed. However, a wet nurse saves a three-year-old girl, placing her in foster care. Eventually Shapur marries her and she gives birth to Hormazd, and in this way Ardashir and his des cendants are able to conquer all of Iran and become the Shahen-Shah, the King of Kings. Thus the Sasanian traditions tell of a double massacre: Ardashir massacres the House of Ardawan and the House of Mihrag, and in both cases only one daughter survives. Similarly, the Bavli story tells of a double massacre, of the Has moneans and the sages, and in both cases only one individual survives. There is also the Indian sage consulted by Ardashir, perhaps parallel to Bava b. Buta, with whom Herod consults. These points are more speculative, as there is much less of a direct parallel. Rather there are a few common elements configured differently in the two accounts. But these are at least as compelling as the indirect parallels to Josephus, such as the wife of Pheroras jumping off a roof, which some scholars point to as evidence of Josephan influence. 56.

These include the basic "facts" that both were usurpers who founded new dynasties, both (re)built temples, and perhaps that both killed incum bents of the ruling dynasty and attempted to legitimate their dynasty through mar riage to females of that dynasty—although these latter two tendencies are so common that they can hardly be considered distinctive about these two figures. The sages consequently imagined and constructed a story of Herod's rise to power that borrowed from Sasanian traditions about Ardashir's ascent. Most importantly, they seem to have explained why Herod was able to seize power on the basis of a Sasanian tradition that explains Ardashir's success, namely that Ardashir rebelled at the auspicious time for slaves to triumph over their masters, the time determined by astrologers on the basis of the celestial bodies. In this way the rabbis portrayed the transition from the Hasmonean to Herodian dynasty on the basis of the change from Parthian (Arsacid) to Sasanian dynasties. Deviations between the rabbinic and Sasanian stories, especially with regard to marriage with the previous dynasty, can be explained in terms of the opposite biases of the storytellers: the Sasanians portray Ardashir as the legitimate king where the sages portray Herod as an illegitimate usurper. The appreciation of the Sasanian traditions helps us to understand aspects of the rabbinic narrative that deviate from accounts found in Josephus and other historians and seem to have no basis whatsoever in historical reality. It is surely possible—though specu lative—that a rabbinic story hewing more closely to Josephus's account was later revised under the influence of Sasanian sources. But given the lack of rabbinic par allelsallels and earlier versions it is difficult to reconstruct the stages of the story's composition. This finding has important implications concerning the rabbinic awareness of Sasanian tradition in particular, and of the overall degree of acculturation of the Babylonian rabbis in general. There is, to be sure, no reason to expect that the sages would not have known Sasanian royal ideology and traditions about the rise of the Sasanian dynasty. Recent work of Yaakov Elman, Geoffrey Herman, Shai Secunda, Reuven Kipperwasser and others, points to a high degree of acculturation among the Babylonian sages. Nevertheless, it is always exciting to identify further dimensions of their knowledge of Sasanian tradition. Finally, we should note that, if these claims are correct, the Bavli may be our earliest witness to the Sasanian tradition of Ardashir's ascent. It is possible, to be sure, that the Sasanian tradition was composed in the time of Ardashir himself or shortly thereafter. Yet the sources attesting to the tradition are much later: the com position of the Karnamag is generally dated to the sixth century CE, although the texts we have postdate the Islamic conquest. Tabari and Firdowsi are even later. Dating unattributed Bavli stories is always difficult (see the appendix). But even if the story is stammaitic, dating to the late fifth or sixth century CE, then it is at least as old as the Karnamag. If the story, or at least its core, is amoraic, dating to the early fifth or even fourth century CE, then it antedates the 269</page><page sequence="22">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein Sasanian/Islamic sources by at least a century. In this way the rabbinic narrative can contribute to knowledge of the development of Sasanian historiography. Jeffrey L. Rubenstein New York University New York, New York 270</page><page sequence="23">King Herod in Ardashir's Court Appendix: Parallels and Dating The story lacks any substantive parallel anywhere in classical rabbinic literature.61 However, several components do have parallels within the Bavli. A parallel to the maiden's suicide proclamation appears in a statement of Shmu'elShmu'el found in B. Kiddushin 70b. In the course of a long story that begins with a controversy over preferential treatment of a rabbi's slave,62 we find the following: B. Kiddushin 70b (first printing): B. Bava Batra 3b (A) His opponent said to Rav Yehu dah: "You call me a slave, who has descended from the royal Hasmo nean House!" He (Rav Yehudah) said to him, "Thus said Shmu'el: Whoever says, 'I come from the Hasmonean House,' is a slave." (B) He said to him ... He said to him, "Behold, there is Rav Matneh who holds as I do." ... (C) He (Rav Matneh) said to him: "Thus said Shmu'el: Whoever says, 'I come from the royal Has monean house' is a slave." (D) "For only that maiden remained from them, who went up to the roof and raised her voice and said, 'Whoever says, "I come from the Hasmonean house is a slave."' She jumped from the roof and died." &lt;When that maiden saw that he wished to marry her,63&gt; She went up to the roof and raised her voice and said, "Whoever says, '1 am from the Hasmonean House' is a slave. For only that maiden (=me) was left from them, and she jumped and died." 61. The parallel in the late midrash, Yalkut Shim'oni #913, clearly derives from the Bavli. 62.

Rubenstein Section D, however, is not found in MSS Munich or Vatican, or in the "Spanish" printing (c. 1489), of B. Kiddushin 70b. It appears only in MS Oxford and the first printing (Venice, 1520). This suggests that it was transferred by copyists from our story to B. Kiddushin 70b as a type of support or etiology for Shmu'el'sShmu'el'sShmu'el's statement. Indeed, it is superfluous in that context, as the point at issue in B. Kiddushin 70b is whether Rav Yehudah's attribution of the tradition to Shmu'el is trustworthy, which Rav Matneh confirms (C). Shmu'el's dictum, taken in and of itself, says nothing about Herod. In this passage it is directed against an opponent of Rav Yehudah, an unnamed sage from Nehardea, who disrespected Rav Yehudah's authority. This sage, clearly, would not have agreed with Shmu'el's claim, nor with the Hasmonean maiden tra dition. Indeed, that he touted his Hasmonean descent suggests that Shmu'el's assertion was not widely known. After this disclosure, the story continues, many marriage contracts were torn up in Nehardea, as marriages to families who flaunted Hasmonean descent were invalidated. Clearly these families had never heard of Shmu'el's tradition either. The story contains further genealogical attacks directed at various Babylonian Jewish families. Rav Yehudah also states that a certain family in Nehardea, the House of Urbati, is genealogically impure, and that other individuals are slaves or mamzerim. Therefore the original context of Shmu'el's dictum would appear to be rabbinic genealogical polemics, quite possibly against Babylonian aristocratic families claiming priestly lineage.64 Geoffrey Herman has argued that priestly lineage was greatly esteemed in Babylonia, in part because of the importance of lineage in Sasanian society, and many leading rabbis were descended from priests or married into priestly families.65 Apparently some sages also faced competition from these aristocratic families who claimed priestly yihus, and these sages responded in part by impugning the genealogical claims. Therefore, it seems that the storytellers in B. Bava Batra 3b 4a incorporated Shmuel's dictum into their story, putting it in the mouth of the Hasmonean maiden, and thereby providing a narrative etiology. Shmuel's dictum, however, provides no help in dating the anonymous Herod story. The second "appendix" to the story about the beauty of Herod's temple is paralleled in B. Sukkah 51b, and seems to have borrowed from that source: 64. Kalmin, Sages, Stories, Authors, and Editors, 65: "The story portrays an attempt by rabbis to discredit self-proclaimed Hasmoneans in Amoraic Babylonia." Cf. Vidas, "The Bavli's Discussion of Genealogy," 312-13: "The instruction concerning Hasmonean descent should probably be read not just in terms of a rabbinic assertion regarding the historical house of the Maccabees (though it was certainly understood to be so later), but also as targeting genealogical boasting by honor-seeking or match seeking Jews who affiliated themselves with the Jewish royal house in order to boost their genealogical status." 65.

Bava Batra 4a [A] Our sages taught: He who never saw the rejoicing at the place of the water-drawing {simhat bet ha-shoha-sho 'evah), never saw joy in his life. He who never saw Jerusalem in its glory, never saw a beautiful city. He who never saw the temple in its construction, never saw a glorious building. [B] To what does this refer? Abaye, and some say Rav Hisda, said: This is the building of Herod. fC] With what did he build it? [D] Rava said: With stones of alabaster and marble. Some say with stones of alabaster, stibnite, and marble. One row went in and one went out so that it could be plastered. [E] He [Herod] thought of covering it with gold. The sages said to him, "Leave it alone, as it is more beauti ful thus, as it looks like the waves of water." [b] They said: He who never saw the building of Herod, never saw a beautiful building. With what did he build it? With stones of alabaster and marble. Some say with stones of alaba ster, stibnite, and marble. One row went in and one went out so that it could be plastered. He [Herod] thought of covering it with gold. The sages said to him, "Leave it alone, as it is more beautiful thus, as it looks like the waves of water." In B. Sukkah 51b the beauty of the temple is mentioned in a baraita together with the beauty of Jerusalem and the Rejoicing at the Place of Water-Drawing {simhat{simhat bet ha-sho'evah) [A], and the Amoraim then clarify that the baraita refers to the Herodian temple [B].66 The storytellers in B. Bava Batra 3b 4a have reworked the baraita, first by omitting the first two elements, since they are irrelevant to the story, and second, by incorporating the amoraic identification of the temple as Herod's directly into the baraita (see the bold text), and conse quently dispensing of the attributions to Abaye [B] and Rava [D].67 But in any case, this passage, which I have called an "appendix," was not necessarily part 66.66. This baraita has no parallels, though the first clause appears verbatim in M. Sukkah 5:2. That Rava's name is omitted in most manuscripts of B. Bava Batra 4a (section [D]), also suggests that B. Sukkah 51b is the original, and the name was omitted when the section was transferred to B. Bava Batra 4a. 67.67. It is possible that the storytellers in B. Bava Batra 4a are responsible for adding section E, which contributes to the theme that the sages, rather than Herod, deserve credit for the temple, and this section was subsequently transferred back to B. Sukkah 51b. But it is probably less risky to take section E as part of the original tradition in B. Sukkah 51 b, and simply a product of a more general (anachro nistic) tendency to see the sages in control of Jewish institutions throughout the ages. 273</page><page sequence="26">Jeffrey Jeffrey L. Rubenstein of the original story in B. Bava Batra 3b-4a. It could have been constructed and appended at a later time, and provides no help with dating the story. Apart from these passages, the story does not appear to have borrowed from other Bavli traditions, as we typically find among late, stammaitic narratives.68 The description of a character committing suicide by jumping off a roof, as noted above, appears in a number of stories in the Bavli. However, this is a type of stock phrase or stock motif, and need not have been transferred from another story. The lack of parallel passages both within and without the Bavli makes the dating of the story extremely difficult. Stylistically, the duplications within the story may provide some evidence of stammaitic composition.69 The two mas sacres, first of the Hasmoneans, then of the sages, are narrated with some similar phrasing, and we find a few other cases of repeated language.70 [B2] He arose and killed all of the sages and left Bava b. Buta to take advice from him One day he [Herod] came and sat I am afraid of the Kingdom of Rome [Bl] He arose and killed all of his masters. He left [only] that maiden. ... that he took in marriage the daughter of a king One day he heard a voice I am afraid lest there be another man However, such stylistic criteria are not sufficient to argue for stammaitic composition in and of themselves. Hence the story cannot be conclusively dated. It could well be stammaitic, like many relatively lengthy and highly developed narratives. But a late amoraic dating cannot be ruled out. 68. There may be a loose parallel in Bava b. Buta's mention of the year it takes for a messenger to reach Rome and a year to return, to the account of Ravina waiting for one year for a caravan to go to Be Hozai and one year for it to return (in the context of seizing a debtors property), B. Bava Kamma 112b. But the formulations do not have enough language in common to suggest direct dependence. See too the account of R. Hunab. Natan in B. BabaBatra 74b. The exegesis of Deuteronomy 17:15 in terms of a Jewish king (and other leaders), which Herod attributes to the sages, appears elsewhere in the Bavli (B. Yevamot 45b and 102a, B. Kiddusin 76b, and especially B. Bava Kamma 88a). But again the story tellers do not seem to have drawn directly from these passages, and the exegesis appears to be early; see Sifre Devarim, Shoftim, pisAil to Deuteronomy 17:15 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 208). 69. Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Balti more: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 258-59; Jeffrey L.
