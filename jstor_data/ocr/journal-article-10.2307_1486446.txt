<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stanley Nash. In Search of Hebraism: Shai Hurwitz and His Polemics in the Hebrew Press. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1980. 410 pp. From the outset, Stanley Nash declares that he sees the subject of his monograph, the European Hebrew writer Shai Ish Hurwitz (1861-1922), as a "major minor figure" (p. 2). Nash does not claim that Hurwitz can be compared in depth of thought or influence on his period to such great Hebrew literary figures as Ahad Ha'am, H. N. Bialik, M. Y. Berdyczewski, or Y. H. Brenner. Instead, Nash asserts, the value of his study of Hurwitz's life is that it "provides an excellent prism through which to view the complex undertow of Hebrew belles-lettres" (p. 2), by which he means the polemical debates in the Hebrew press which expressed the intellectual and emotional trends that lay behind the fiction and poetry of Hurwitz's generation. By focusing on the role of Hurwitz in these polemical debates, Nash has made an important contribution to an area of study which is crucial to an under- standing of modern Hebrew literature through all periods of its develop- ment to the present, "the interface in Hebrew letters between the didactic and the lyrical, the publicistic and the poetic, the scholarly and the 'liter- ary'" (p. 1). Nash's account of Hurwitz's polemical positions is at times so detailed that the effectiveness of his argument is thereby diminished. Nevertheless, the author does present an instructive analysis of the essential direction of Hurwitz's polemics and the part they played in the polemics of European Hebrew literature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies. Nash views the polemics of Hurwitz's day as "an embodiment of the search for a new Hebraic humanism, as the yearning to resolve and trans- cend the psychological and cultural conflicts of diaspora Judaism" (p. 1). This search is particularly evident in the series of polemical controversies aroused by articles written by Hurwitz during the years 1904-1913. Such titles of these articles as "Li-She'elat Qiyyum ha-Yahadut" ("On the Con-</page><page sequence="2">130 BOOK REVIEWS tinuance of Judaism") (1904) and "Shete Derakhim" ("Two Paths") (1907) are characteristic of the urgent manner in which Hebrew writers of the period addressed questions of Jewish identity. In these articles Hurwitz chose to take extreme, unpopular positions, opposing the cultural and poli- tical paths taken by his contemporaries as solutions to the crises of Jewish existence in the early twentieth century: Dubnow's autonomism, Ahad Ha'am's cultural nationalism, the neoromantic writings of M. Z. Feierberg, Y. L. Peretz, and others. In one article, "Ha-Hasidut ve-ha-Haskalah" ("Hasidism and Haskalah") (1908), Hurwitz attacked the trend of turning to Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal inspired by such writers as Peretz, Berdyczewski, and Buber. As we learn from Nash's analysis, the central thread running through Hurwitz's critique of these solutions was his conviction that they were com- promises with the cultural conditions of the galut. Hurwitz argued instead for a total negation of the galut. He wrote of two possible methods of such a negation: (1) a full Zionist solution, in which the Jewish people would be settled in the Land of Israel, where they would create a new Jewish culture, and (2) assimilation of the Jew into European society. Since Hurwitz did not declare his unequivocal faith in the success of the Zionist enterprise (in "On the Continuance of Judaism" he questioned whether it would ever suc- ceed), some readers of his essays began to suspect that in the final analysis he was urging Jewish intellectuals to assimilate through conversion to Chris- tianity. When Hurwitz declared in "Hasidism and Haskalah" that "the reaction of primitive Christianity to rabbinism contained more truly 'Jewish' ethical content than did Hasidism" (p. 189), he merely confirmed suspicions that he was secretly a missionary for Christianity. The main figure to accuse Hurwitz publicly of advocating Jewish apos- tasy was the Hebrew writer and editor S. M. Lazar, who made that accusa- tion on two occasions, after the publication of "On the Continuance of Judaism" and again after the publication of "Hasidism and Haskalah." The second time the charge was made, Hurwitz sued Lazar for libel before what Nash refers to as "a 'Jewish court' comprised of local Galician leaders of the Zionist movement" (p. 192). More important than the outcome of the trial (Hurwitz emerged victor- ious) is the fact that Lazar's accusations set off an emotional controversy so intense that it culminated in the libel trial. Jewish attitudes toward Chris- tianity were of great concern to the European Jewish intelligentsia of that time. As Nash points out, Hurwitz was only one of several European Jewish writers in the early twentieth century to become interested in early Chris-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 131 tianity: Y. Klausner, S. A. Horodetsky, M. Y. Berdyczewski, S. Asch, and others. At the same time, however, Jewish intellectuals had "a subconscious fear" (p. 211) that Jewish identity would be destroyed through intermarriage and assimilation into Christian culture. Nash makes clear that this fear was not without basis: Hurwitz and three writers who were his friends, Ahad Ha'am, S. Dubnow, and M. ben Hillel Hacohen, had children who inter- married. The suspicion that Hurwitz was a missionary continued to plague him after the libel trial with Lazar. It arose again when Hurwitz, as editor of the journal He-'Atid, devoted space in 1911 to articles on Christianity by Horodetsky and Klausner, and when he wrote in an article, "Shevarim (mi- Yalquto shel Ben-Abuyah)" ("Fragments [from the Satchel of Ben Abuyah]") (1911), "of cultural redemption by 'messiahs' and 'heretics' " (p. 302). As a result of renewed charges of missionizing, Hurwitz was forced to resign as president of the Organization for Hebrew Language and Culture, which he had founded. Hurwitz's extreme stance of negation of the galut through Zionism or assimilation was, as Nash maintains, contradicted by his lifelong devotion to the development of Jewish culture in Europe. He founded two cultural foundations, Sinai and the above-mentioned Organization for Hebrew Lan- guage and Culture, and he continued to participate as a writer and editor in the European cultural life of his time. Indeed, Nash's study suggests that since Hurwitz did not have much faith in Zionism, the real choice for him was either to hope that it was possible to maintain some form of Jewish life in the galut or to conclude in despair that Jewish identity was doomed to extinction. This movement between the moods of hope and despair was most parti- cularly pronounced, as Nash points out, in 1912-1913, with the publication in Hurwitz's He-'A tid of both a symposium of Jewish intellectuals, "'Al ha- Yahadut ve-'al 'Atidotehah" ("On Judaism and Its Prospects"), and an article by Hurwitz titled "Ha-Sa'ar ha-Yehudi" ("The Jewish Sorrow"). The symposium was indicative of the side of Hurwitz's soul which kept searching for ways to keep the cultural activity of Jews alive by engaging with other Jewish intellectuals in the elucidation of issues related to Jewish existence in the twentieth century. The following year, however, the despair- ing side of Hurwitz's soul emerged. In response to the suicides of two young Hebrew writers, Ben Yisra'el (Y. L. Pupes) and M. M. Feitelson, Hurwitz published his article "The Jewish Sorrow," in which he dismissed, as he had in 1904, all the various attempts of Jewish intellectuals to find a way to con-</page><page sequence="4">132 BOOK REVIEWS tinue Jewish existence in the twentieth century. The article set off a new wave of reaction against Hurwitz in the Hebrew press. Hurwitz claimed that he took extreme positions in order to shock his readers out of complacent acceptance of the status quo. Nash asserts, however, that there was more to Hurwitz's radical critique of the galut than hyperbolic rhetoric: Hurwitz really did believe, "at least subconsciously" (p. 356), that in order to renew Jewish culture it might be necessary to assimi- late into European Christian culture. Thus, Shabbetai Zevi, the Jewish messiah who converted to Islam, and the Haskalah movement, which sought to bring Jews closer to European culture, were very attractive to Hurwitz. Hurwitz's subconscious attraction to assimilation, Nash suggests, may have stemmed from a "death wish" (p. 362) attempt to escape the ten- sions between the Jewish and Christian cultures by destroying the former and embracing the latter. Why did Hurwitz, despite his active involvement in the Zionist move- ment, never fully accept Zionism as the answer to the dilemmas of modern Jewish existence? Nash claims that Hurwitz's demurral from Zionism derived from his being too psychologically committed to the tensions of his galut existence to give it up. "The man who most abhorred the limbo exis- tence of galut was loathe to surrender its energizing powers. Hurwitz was content to perpetuate that creative tension of perpetual malaise and restless striving ... upon which, one suspects, Hurwitz virtually thrived" (p. 243). Through the life of Shai Ish Hurwitz, Stanley Nash has presented a por- trait of a generation of Hebrew writers pulled between two extremes: (1) national revival in Zion, and (2) self-destruction by suicide or assimila- tion. Like Hurwitz, many were unable to commit themselves fully to either radical solution and therefore opted for a third course: the struggle to revive Jewish culture in Europe. In the period shortly before and after Hurwitz's death, history - through the Bolshevik Revolution and the Nazi Holocaust - intervened, leaving the revival of Jewish culture primarily in the hands of Hurwitz's intellectual heirs in Western Europe, America, and Israel.
