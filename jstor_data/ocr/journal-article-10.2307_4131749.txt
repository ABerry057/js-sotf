<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judah M. Cohen. Through the Sands of Time: A History of the Jewish Community ofSt. Thomas, US. Virgin Islands. Hanover, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2004. xxvi, 298 pp. Immediately following his acknowledgments, Cohen begins his volume with an invitation that aims to evoke our interest in the Jews of St. Thomas. This chap- ter structure-in which the volume commences with what is in essence a justifi- cation for its publication-elicits an intriguing question about the study of Jewish life. Cohen is asking us to consider why one should be interested in this (and by implication, any?) small community of Jews. His subsequent introductory chapter 382</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews poses a second fundamental question. It asks whether, in an age in which prevail- ing historical models have been subject to critical reexamination, a history that is organized by chronology rather than by theme can have scholarly value. The core of his response to these questions is that the St. Thomas Jewish community is an unusual instance of "accumulative ethnicity" (xxii) and thus constitutes a pattern in Jewish ethnicity worthy of scholarly attention. The narrative is arranged in chronological sequence to convey this pattern. Its unfolding temporal structure al- lows the reader to watch Jewish ethnicities emerge both from, and in place of one another. In raising these questions, Cohen brings a reflexive stance to the narra- tive. Yet, socially constructed memory seems to lie at the heart of the notion of ac- cumulative ethnicity. Most Jews currently living on St. Thomas are transplants from the American mainland. Might the volume's framework also represent an American search for roots, and for roots that are special? It is after 1790 that St. Thomas becomes home to more than a few individ- ual Jews. Western Portuguese Sephardic Jews arrive from the Dutch colony of St. Eustatius (following Rodney's attack) and from St. Domingue (escaping the bat- tles for its independence from France). Several Jews from Morocco arrive con- temporaneously. They are fleeing an ascending sultan's retribution for the loyalty shown to his predecessor. This heterogeneous pattern of immigration continues into the present. Sephardic Jews arrive sporadically over the next century from Cu- ragao, in the 1850s and 1860s from Venezuela, and Ashkenazic Jews arrive from Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth century. More have been arriving from the U.S. following World War II, and others now are arriving from the State of Israel. Each small influx of Jews brings its own cultural traditions, which alter without erasing the patterns of Jewish worship and the social relations that they encounter in St. Thomas. This leads to changes in Jewish communal life that are accumu- lative more than transformative. Each new group of arrivals has been small in number, thus unlikely to replace previous traditions. Heterogeneity in cultural dis- positions has required compromises. The continuing small size of the Jewish pop- ulation-rarely surpassing 500-has meant that the proportion of ongoing to new residents has remained large enough to preserve preexisting practices until the mid-twentieth century. In many ways, this is a story about individuals, families, their social net- works, and their reappearances in varied settings as much as it is of a community. Take, for example, Elijah Levy-Yuly (who so displeases the sultan referred to above), his bondservant, Elias Sarquy, and their descendants. After escaping to Gibraltar, Levy-Yuly frees Sarquy, who settles in St. Thomas by 1795, and, after Levy-Yuly's death, is followed to St. Thomas by Levy-Yuly's wife, daughter, and son, Moses Elias Levy (having dropped Yuly from his name). The families then follow differing trajectories. Sarquy will remain a respected member of the St. Thomas Jewish community until his death in 1849. He enters into business with a Portuguese Sephardic Jew, owns an impressive amount of property in 1803 (20,048 square feet), and his wife owns a business in 1807. Moses Elias becomes a dry goods merchant on St. Thomas, a supporter of a state for Jews in the U.S., and rais- es his two sons to be secular, proto-Zionists. At some point, the business partner of Moses Elias is Emanuel Benjamin, a Portuguese Sephardi and cousin of Judah 383</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews P. Benjamin (who will become secretary of state for the confederacy). When a fire destroys his business in 1831, Moses Elias Levy moves to Florida and attempts to establish a homeland for Jews there. A Florida county bears the Levy name in his honor. David, one of his sons, converts to Christianity, changes his surname to Yulee, and becomes the first U.S. senator from the state of Florida. Intriguing in- terconnections such as these are found throughout the volume. They provide a sense of continuity to events that might otherwise have seemed fragmented, and a close look at the mechanisms of accumulative ethnicity. Although many of the congregation's files have been lost, Cohen has con- ducted a diligent search for documents that could compensate for the gaps. He has drawn on a variety of archival sources as well as interviews with current residents to achieve a remarkably broad picture of Jewish life on St. Thomas. These sources shape the type of narrative that he is able to present, a narrative that while sympa- thetic and accessible avoids the nostalgic sentimentality too often found in histo- ries prepared with congregational support. And, while the notion of accumulative ethnicity may reflect a kind of wishful thinking (i.e., of memory), it also receives a good deal of detailed support.
