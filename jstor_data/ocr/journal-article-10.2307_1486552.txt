<plain_text><page sequence="1">Claudia Setzer. Jewish Responses to Early Christians: History and Polemics, 30-150 CE. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1994, viii, 254 pp. This book began as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of Raymond E. Brown at Columbia University/Union Theological Seminary. However, in contrast to what we have come to expect from the genre of doctoral dissertation-a detailed and highly specialized treatment of the smallest possible unit of material--this work makes bold to survey multiple texts that span a 120-year time frame. In fact, the author admits that she began by defining her project even more broadly, to "gather all the explicit statements about what Jews and Christians were saying and doing about one another" (p. 7). Recognizing that many others have studied what Christians were saying about Jews, she limited herself to materials that report Jewish reactions to Christians, and attempts to provide the first systematic collection and evaluation of these sources. As Claudia Setzer carefully explains in her introduction, the very terms "Jews" and "Christians" beg some of the fundamental questions behind this study. Setzer wants to discover "when did Jews begin to see other Jews who believed in Jesus as beyond the pale of the people of Israel, no longer eccentric or deviant Jews, but outsiders? When did Christians begin to see themselves as distinct from other Jews?" (p. 1). Thus, her work is to be situated within the context of discussion in recent scholarship that goes under the nomenclature of "the parting of the ways" or "the process of normative self-definition." In Part I (over three-quarters of the book in terms of number of pages), Setzer works systematically through the "Materials That Report Jewish Reactions to Christians." In this category, she includes the Pauline and Deutero-Pauline Letters, the Synoptic Gospels, the Book of Acts, the Gospel of John, Revelation, Josephus, the Martyrdom of Polycarp, the Gospel of Peter, and selected Christian apologists (Diogentes, Justin Martyr). A final section goes somewhat beyond her rather arbitrary boundary and surveys</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 249 "Jewish and Christian Writers after 150 CE." In the much shorter Part II, Setzer isolates what she sees to be major trends in Jewish response under the general heading "Tolerance, Physical Attacks and Verbal Reactions." For the most part Setzer's final conclusions do not differ radically from what others have observed over the last decade. She makes an interesting suggestion that examples of tolerance may have been much more common than the written evidence leads us to believe; acceptance does not make for literature that survives. She emphasizes that we are dealing with a gradual separation (and thus older theories about birkat ha-minim as a decisive break-point are not supported by the texts); that the different reactions do not follow any simple chronological or geographical line; and that the interpretation of Scripture became increasingly the focus of debate. Her "most striking conclusion" is the claim that Jews did not see themselves as separate until the middle of the second century, while Christians made such a claim for themselves and their self-identity considerably earlier. In some ways, the strengths of this book are also its weakness. Setzer directs us to look at the large picture, the whole panorama, and to think about texts in relationship to one another that have often only been considered in isolation. But in a book of under 200 pages, individual authors and complex passages can only be treated in a relatively superficial manner. In addition, it is not always clear whether Setzer is writing for her academic peers or for a very general audience (as when she attempts to describe the Synoptic problem). Setzer's penchant for further reducing everything to one- or two-page charts, while perhaps helpful to some readers, only heightens the appearance of an enforced simplification, in spite of her repeated protestations about the complexity of the material and what we cannot know. Often it is not clear how she makes her judgments about the historical validity of her sources other than to fall back on a commonplace "it is likely that ..." approach. Although the book was published in 1994 and there are occasional biblio- graphic references up to 1991-92, most of the interaction with other scholars is with works from the middle and late 1980s. And although the title contains the word "History," there is little discussion of how historical events, especially the Jewish Revolt of 66-70 CE and the Christian response (flight to Pella or not?), entered into shaping the Jewish response to early Christians.
