Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000. xiii, 320 pp. Responsible students of Isaac Abarbanel face a complicated task. This tow- ering figure was more than a "statesman and philosopher." He was one of the most prolific writers in the Middle Ages and Early Modem periods, both in terms of quantity and variety of genres. As a Jewish leader, his writings reflect the turbu- lent age of Spanish Jewry after the expulsion from Spain and the spiritual needs of the refugees. Living in a milieu exposed to renaissance culture, one must be at- tentive to its influence on Abarbanel's world. But the most important fact one must keep in mind is that he was saturated with the long classical medieval intellectual legacy, not only the philosophical tra- dition, but no less the exegetical one. Moreover, the bulk of Abarbanel's literary efforts belonged to the genre of biblical exegesis. The fact that scholars, by and large, did not pay enough attention to these writings, save for their specific limit- ed studies of his thought, can be attributed to their voluminous nature and to the difficult task of analyzing them in the broad context of medieval biblical exegesis from Rashi onward. Lawee's study, though using as a starting point the two trea- tises Ateret Zeqenim and Yeshu'ot Meshiho for detailed analysis, incorporates the entire corpus of Abarbanel's writings. Anything less than that would be a serious flaw in attempting to synthesize Abarbanel's "stance toward tradition," and many previous studies of Abarbanel testify to that. The multi-layered platform of "contexts" for the study is dealt with by the author primarily in two introductory chapters ("Life and Contexts" and "Works and Traditions"), in which an updated survey of Abarbanel's life and intellectual biography is given. This includes his formative Portuguese period (about 40 years), his ten years in Spain, and his Italian career, as well as the major figures and trends that played a role in his world. A clear survey of the order of his works completes this long but essential introduction. A study of Abarbanel's attitude to tradition, be it in biblical exegesis, theol- ogy, or messianism, all of which are discussed in this volume, must reflect his ref- erences to the Midrash, Medieval philosophy, kaballah-indeed to everyone who claimed to be the true heir of Jewish religious truth. Lawee begins his investiga- tion with Abarbanel's first work: Ateret Zeqenim (Lisbon, late 1460s). This ex- egetical work, concentrating on the enigmatic story of the "nobles of the children of Israel" (Ex. 24:9-11) is also a starting point for Abarbanel, who reveals his at- 338</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews titude to the "time-honored rabbinic interpretations and the main medieval claimants to the mantle of Jewish tradition, the philosophers and kabbalists" (pp. 59-60), and uses it as a springboard to deal with major topic which will cen- tral to his thought in his works throughout his literary activity. How does one do justice in a short review to a study whose most conspicu- ous contributions lie in "nuancing" of views and endless qualifications of well- established and long standing generalizations and clich6s? Abarbanel's "conser- vatism" is well known, especially in his dialogue with the rationalistic-Mai- monidean tradition. But Lawee succeeds in painting in detail this general picture, only after dissecting each relevant reference in the most patient, meticulous, rig- orous, cautious, and sensitive manner. The closing sentence of this chapter char- acterizes the conclusions on other scores throughout this volume: "conservatism on the one hand; occasionally bold independence from traditionally received opin- ion on the other" (p. 82). Nothing about Abarbanel is ever simple. This is evident especially in Abarbanel's stance to the Midrash. First, facing the biblical text as a exegete committed to peshat (and Abarbanel saw himself as such) demands a critical attitude to midrashic interpretations. As a rationalist thinker, Abarbanel had to deal with theologically problematic dicta of Hazal and with medieval tensions, both internal (rival spiritual trends) and external (polemics with Christianity). On the one hand, we may find him rejecting what Lawee terms the "renunciationist" position of Nahmanides and the Andalucian school, which rejected any binding authority of the Midrash in nonlegal matters. On the other, when hard-pressed by Christian polemics, Abarbanel holds just such a view (p. 164), while still claiming in general that Hazal's messianic traditions are not to be taken lightly. Often the reader is left with the impression that the only consis- tency by Abarbanel is his lack of it. Or better, the only consistency is that Abar- banel's attitude is adjusted in accordance with his needs as a theologian or as a Jewish leader. In the end of the long process of dealing with the details, Lawee is able to do away with some accepted "truths" concerning Abarbanel and his works. Looking at them from this study's prism of midrashic exegesis, his messianic trilogy can- not be seen as a mere attempt at defusing christological interpretations, or reduce it to concise reference manuals for Jewish preachers in their efforts to fend off Christian attacks (p. 167). One of the most important contributions of this study lies in the last chap- ter, which deals with Abarbanel's historical thinking. Abarbanel stood in an im- portant historical junction between the Middle Ages and Renaissance (already in Iberia), between Jewish traditional non-historical thinking and revolutionary crit- ical thinking of figures such as Azariah de' Rossi in the second half of the sixteenth century. Was there a significent Renaissance mentality to be found in his histori- cal thinking? Did Abarbanel's critical stance toward classical text play any role in the transition to the "modern" bold independence expressed in de' Rossi's rejec- tion of Jewish nonlegal traditions that conflict with reliable non-Jewish sources? Lawee detects traces of Renaissance historical thinking in Abarbanel's bib- lical exegesis, as in his critical view concerning the authorship of biblical books, relying on non-Jewish sources, and interest in chronological problems. As always, 339</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews his conservatism is the barrier between his innovative impulses and extreme con- clusions that follow from his attitude. Abarbanel would not dare apply to the Pen- tateuch the critical tools used in analyzing the Prophets. (Lawee points out that facing "modernity's onslaught" on Scriptures, traditionalists like Malbim criti- cized Abarbanel for his bold critical statements. Taking his conservative sensibil- ity into account one might guess that, facing the world of Haskalah and biblical criticism, Abarbanel himself would have recoiled from his conclusions.) For as systematic a person as Abarbanel was, this approach suggests that he found him- self in the difficult position of knowing the truth and yet feeling the need to deny its consequences. In comparison, Azariah had no problem rejecting Jewish tradi- tional chronology. In the polemical context of his historical analysis/criticism of the development of Christianity, Abarbanel represents the missing link between Profayt Duran (end of fourteenth century) and Leone de Modena (seventeenth cen- tury). This chapter is a refutation of B. Z. Netanyahu's failure to see Abarbanel's historically critical attitude in evaluating the veracity of ancient holy texts. Lawee's study is a rich and valuable one in all respects. It is sound method- ologically, and will, I hope, set a new standard of scholarship in Abarbanel stud- ies.
