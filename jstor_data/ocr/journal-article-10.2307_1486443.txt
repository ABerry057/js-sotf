<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bernard Septimus. Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition: The Career and Controversies of Ramah. Harvard Judaic Monographs, no. 4. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1982. xiv, 180 pp. Just as they did for Western Christendom, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries marked a period of expansion, conflict, and consolidation for the Jewish communities of medieval Europe. Paradoxically, as the brunt of Jewish cultural creativity gradually shifted from the world of Islam to the Latin West, interactions between European Jews and Christians were becoming more intense and more hostile. Transition in high medieval Jewish civilization yielded vitality and growth on the one hand, cultural alienation and disorientation on the other. How was Jewish society to relate to a world which proffered (at least ostensibly) physical security and economic pros- perity, but whose own evolving world view - by which medieval Jews never ceased to be influenced - undermined the values and survival of Judaism? Tosafistic scholarship, Ashkenazic pietism, and Provenqal Kabbalah all bear witness to this intriguing phenomenon. Yet nowhere were such tenden- cies as complex or as pronounced as in Spain, much of whose large Jewish population left the Muslim world and joined the ranks of European Chris- tian society, all within the span of several generations. The resulting socio- religious turbulence, through which the geonic-Andalusian tradition of the Golden Age - crippled but not extinguished by the Berber persecutions and</page><page sequence="2">120 BOOK REVIEWS the Christian Reconquest - struggled to adapt to a new milieu, provides the major focus of Bernard Septimus's new book. Professor Septimus investigates the character of late-twelfth- and early- thirteenth-century Hispano-Jewish culture through the window of the career of Rabbi Meir ben Todros ha-Levi Abulafia (=Ramah; ca. 1165-1244), halakhist, poet, nasi, and polemicist in the Castilian capital of Toledo. Ably intertwined with other bits of pertinent textual evidence, the few known details concerning the life of Ramah are first presented so as to illustrate pressing problems of the contemporary Jewish community: the extent to which the Castilian Jew should rightfully cultivate the learning and life-style of secular Iberian culture; the struggle to reestablish the institu- tions and stature of talmudic scholarship in Spain; the difficult, often pain- ful, but ultimately fruitful encounter with Jewish communities north and east of the Pyrenees. Born and reared in a wealthy aristocratic family, Ramah maintained and exemplified the paradigm of the elitist Andalusian Jewish courtier; yet he himself vociferously decried the moral and religious decadence that frequently resulted from such a life-style. The most capable Spanish talmudist of his day, Ramah defended and promoted the study of the "minutiae" of Halakhah, learning which had languished in twelfth- century Castile and which aroused scorn and contempt among more urbane elements of the Jewish aristocracy. And Ramah was the first Spanish rab- binic leader to seek and maintain contacts with the halakhic authorities of Ashkenaz, communication which contributed to the new European orienta- tion of Iberian Jewry. From these general concerns of Ramah's career, Septimus turns to his involvement in the early stages of the Maimonidean controversy: his protest in 1202 to the rabbis of Lunel over Maimonides' seeming denial of bodily resurrection, the hostile responses of the Proven- qal Aaron b. Meshullam and Sheshet Benveniste of Barcelona, and Ramah's ensuing appeal to the tosafists of Northern France; Ramah's more muted position following the death of Maimonides and the appearance of Ma'amar Tehiyyat ha-Metim; and his reluctance to participate actively in the explosive polemical disputes that plagued French and Spanish Jewries in the 1230s. The book then concludes with a penetrating analysis of Ramah's antirationalism, categorizing it in relation to the other prominent intellec- tual and religious orientations of contemporary European Jews. Any appraisal of this book must begin with recognition of its valuable contribution to the intellectual historiography of the High Middle Ages; once again the Harvard Judaic Monographs series offers us fresh, creative insight into the character of rabbinic leadership in medieval Christian</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 121 Europe. Yet one ought also to take note of the singular difficulties and risks which the composition of this particular monograph entailed, echoed in the very juxtaposition of its title and subtitle. Can the generally obscure career of a single individual like Ramah constitute an effective vehicle for narrating and evaluating a pivotal period in Jewish cultural history? Conversely, to what extent can a synthetic, mosaic-type picture of the leadership of that period - even with numerous references to the subject's family, friends, and students - compensate for glaring lacunae in our knowledge of the subject of an intellectual biography? Despite Professor Septimus's admirable com- mand of the pertinent halakhic and philosophical literature, as well as his straightforward admission of the problem, the quasi-biographical focus of the book could at times prove troublesome. To "retrieve something of the living context of Ramah's career" (p. viii), this book often has recourse to conjecture and speculation, which, however reasoned and attractive, only underscore the reader's frustration over the inaccessibility of the real Ramah. Unquestionably worthwhile discursive analyses of the ideas and writings of other figures - e.g., those involved in the "Spanish-Provencal halakhic dialectic" and in the Maimonidean controversy - hint at the pos- sibility that the focus on Ramah may actually have restricted the author from expounding his theme more comprehensively, which he appears well equipped to do. Despite the author's understandable reluctance to plunge into the technical complexities of halakhic scholarship within the present work, if "Ramah doubtless thought of himself first and foremost as a hala- khist [and] talmudic studies received the lion's share of his interest and literary activity" (p. 21), more extensive discussion of his halakhic writings might well have enhanced our appreciation of his career and world view. In the final analysis, however, these reservations are greatly over- shadowed by the worth of Professor Septimus's endeavor. Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition embodies a captivating and illuminating account of the cultural problems confronting Spanish Jews at the beginning of the thir- teenth century. The relationship between scientific and revealed truth then posed a burning issue for Christian, Muslim, and Jewish thinkers alike. And Septimus confronts the dramatis personae and agenda of the Maimonidean controversy with an unrivaled sensitivity to fine but crucial ideological dis- tinctions which explain seeming inconsistencies in earlier accounts of the same events. How could a figure like Ramah, nasi in Toledo, son-in-law to the treasurer of Alfonso VIII of Castile, well-schooled in Arabic but evi- dently ignorant of Latin and Romance, have opposed Maimonides, cham- pion of the Sephardic tradition, to the extent of seeking an alliance with the</page><page sequence="4">122 BOOK REVIEWS unsophisticated tosafists of Northern France? Granted that he did, why then did the pro-Maimonidean scholars of Provence wonder at Ramah's anti- rationalism decades later, after prolonged and sustained correspondence with him? Septimus convincingly demonstrates that for Provenqal and Ashkenazic scholars the Maimonidean controversy pitted the rationalism of the geonic-Andalusian tradition, which had evolved directly from Saadya to Maimonides, against the unworldly talmudic culture of Ashkenaz - a glar- ing, stark, and simple contrast. From such a perspective, Ramah, who engaged in nonliteralist aggadic exegesis, who adopted much of Maimo- nides' teaching on incorporeality, who agreed that the future reward would be entirely spiritual (despite his insistence that body and soul would enjoy it together), who engaged in and sanctioned the study of philosophy, but who opposed the Maimunist factions of Spain and Southern France, was anoma- lous indeed. Yet within Spain itself, rationalist and antirationalist recog- nized the radical Aristotelian naturalism implicit in Maimonidean thought and its departure from the conservative Saadyanic precedent. Fearing the threat that the logic of Aristotelian science leveled at divine omnipotence, providence, and the rationale for observing the commandments, Ramah joined the anti-Maimonidean camp with mixed feelings, for unlike most antirationalists of his day, his temperament was also profoundly anti- mystical. Along with kindred spirits like Abba Mari of Lunel, Ijasdai Crescas, Isaac Arama, and Isaac Abravanel, maintains Septimus, Ramah represents an urbane traditionalism which to his mind remained faithful to the geonic-Andalusian legacy, an outlook which called for "broad learning, conservative sensibility, exoteric spirituality, a tendency to disengage reli- gion from nature, cautiously selective use of the esoteric sciences, and reluc- tance to enthrone theoretical knowledge or wholeheartedly embrace a con- templative ideal." One cannot but agree that "their determination to deny themselves the greatest of medieval passions is not without a touch of the heroic" (pp. 114-115). (A final technical note: This book would have benefited considerably from the addition of a bibliography or index auctorum; without either of these, the notes are of significant value only to the specialist already conver- sant with the relevant scholarly literature.)
