Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2006. viii, 254 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001153 With this book, Erin McGlothlin breaks new ground in a field of study that seems well saturated. She expands the definition of "second-generation Holocaust literature" and compares the literary productions of children of survivors with those of children of perpetrators, an intrinsically problematic undertaking. McGlothlin refers to the similarities in these "contrapuntal generations" (9), a term introduced by Eva Hoffmann, as "positional similarity" while acknowled ging "qualitative differences" (230). That is, she steers clear of treating the lega cies of survival and perpetration as analogous experiences and avoids the pitfalls of parallelizing the inherited trauma of children of survivors with the "burden of guilt" that plague children of perpetrators with its denials, discomfort, and webs of silences. Instead, McGlothlin locates the common theme in the trope of the "mark" and maintains that children of survivors and of perpetrators articulate a feeling of being stigmatized by a past that is both overpowering and inaccessible by virtue of its traumatic destructiveness. The Greek term stigma already refers to victims as well as perpetrators. In ancient times, both slaves and criminals, people whose agency had been taken away in enslavement and those who had abused their agency by willfully breaking the law, were branded with a stigma: "The critical difference between these two groups is the element of agency" (3). Though one is innocent and the other guilty, both are "branded as other and thus marginalized socially" (5). For McGlothlin, the experience of stigmatization connects the generations that grew up on opposite sides but in the shadow of the same cataclysmic violence of the Holocaust. The offspring of survivors live with "phantom pain" and are driven to externalize violence inflicted on an invisible limb, an amputation they did not experience personally. The legacy of per petration, on the other hand, is sensed like the mythic "mark of Cain," a vague burden of guilt and a hazy fear of being tainted by atrocities committed by fathers (and mothers) who themselves refused to acknowledge wrongdoing or to express regret. McGlothlin builds on trauma theory to explain the transmission of suffering and the delegation of "coming to terms" to the second generation: "the second generation suffers the effects of trauma it can never claim as its own. The trauma of the second generation is thus not the trauma of the original event, but rather the cumulative effects of the vicarious experience of ongoing suffering caused by the event" (54). Children of survivors find themselves tasked with "postmemory," a term coined by Marianne Hirsch. They struggle to find literary representations for a dehumanization that defies imagination and to memorialize the dead whose murder was supposed to leave no trace of their existence. Texts written by the second generation function as markers of individual lives and deaths, fictional gravestones that permit mourning, an obligatory process without which the living cannot rebuild lives in which they are capable of tolerating and absorbing the loss. Second-generation Jewish authors, McGlothin points out, strive and 204</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews self-consciously reflect on their failure to recover buried secrets, retrieve individ ual histories, map obliterated places, and document a time and a place that see mingly existed in a parallel universe of unreality. Each novel conveys the author's powerlessness in the face of such grief and the existential inability to repair a rupture that exceeds ritual tools of mourning and exhausts cultural resources of understanding. Out of many worthy possibilities, McGlothlin picks nine texts for closer analysis, an assortment that is cogently defended in the introduction. It is most refreshing that McGlothlin extends the range of Jewish second-generation authors by including the voices of Austrian, German, and French Jewish authors. She devotes one chapter each to works by Jewish American sons of survivors (Thane Rosenbaum's Elijah Visible and Art Spiegelmann's Maus) and then examines the novel Geb?rtig by Austrian Robert Schindel. She concludes the first part on the "Legacy of Survival" with a short story, "Arthur Mayer, or The Silence" by German Jewish author Katja Behrens and a French novella Dora Bruder by Patrick Modiano. McGlothlin has the requisite language skills and is sufficiently well acquainted with the non-English literary world to introduce American audi ences to a range of literature that often gets "lost in translation." She is to be com mended for making the diversity of European Jewish second-generation perspectives accessible to the English-speaking world. The fact that three of her five Jewish authors live in Europe strengthens her case that "the children of survi vors and the children of perpetrators are like two sides of the same coin, for they both must confront the aftermath of an event that they have not experienced" (15). Jews who rebuilt their lives in Europe were forced to confront the presence of perpetrators and their families in a visceral, urgent way, whereas American Jews could live in the comfortable illusion of having left Nazi perpetrators behind in the Old World, at a safe distance. European Jewish fictional accounts are written openly and directly in dialogue with the world of perpetrators and their children. Perpetrators' "inability to mourn" was diagnosed by the Mitscherlichs in 1968. While the perpetrator generation is typified by its complete lack of empathy, the second generation continues to struggle with a politically as well as "emotionally correct" approach to the legacy of the Holocaust. Contradictory feelings of love, guilt, and rage form a thick tangle that threatens to perpetuate indifference, denial, and lack of empathy for the victims. The German second gen eration's fictional portrayals of perpetrators get easily ensnared in defensive pos tures or self-righteous condemnations. McGlothlin criticizes Bernhard Schlink's The Reader?rightly, in my view?for exculpating his fictional perpetrator, Hannah. The powerlessness of this concentration camp guard is established by virtue of her gender and class and further amplified by her illiteracy. McGlothlin correctly takes Schlink to task for his attempt to "restore the aura of innocence" and for his failure to overcome a "logic, if she is guilty, then he is guilty by associ ation. In order to free himself of her crime, he must pronounce her innocent" (227). Equally morally dubious, though for opposite reasons, is Niklas Frank's autobio graphical account of his father (and mother), In the Shadow of the Reich. Frank "fashions himself as his father's judge and proceeds to try and execute the 205</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews father with little filial affection" (182). Whereas Schlink protects his protagonist's love by exonerating the perpetrator (as much as possible), Frank denies any emotional attachment to his parents by hurling "insults and invectives" (182). Only Uwe Timm succeeds in combining truthfulness and the courage to confront his family without betraying his emotional connection. Am Beispiel meines Bruders "neither passes final judgment... nor seeks to exculpate... but endeavors to gain some sort of understanding" (220), a morally convincing handling of "the legacy of perpetration." While relationships of children to their survivor parents are also often marked by ambivalence, the moral and political terrain of guilt requires distance and maturity in addition to stylistic skills and literary ability. It is probably not accidental that Timm's book is the most recent. It reflects the fruits of an ongoing cultural process of "coming to terms," not only politically but also personally and emotionally, and of charting a path through the paradoxical maze of guilt. There is much to be gained from such a synoptic analysis of the legacies of survival and perpetration. In its own right, the book represents a step toward healing the rupture of the Holocaust. McGlothlin concludes with a novel by a representative of the third generation, Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything Is Illumi nated. She expresses the hope that the Holocaust will eventually turn into a "joint project" that turns former enemies into "partners in quest of the truth" (232), a bold statement that trusts that even this abyss can be bridged and its destructiveness be healed.
