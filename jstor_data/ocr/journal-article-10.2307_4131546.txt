Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003. xi, 258 pp. Many of the pioneers and settlers who came to America held the Bible in their right hands and were strongly inspired by this "Good Book." They believed 395</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews they had come to the "New Promised Land," and consequently gave Biblical names to the new towns and villages, as well as to their children. It was, therefore, almost natural that the remote land in the east, known as the Holy Land, Palestine, the Promised Land, or The Land of Israel, had, and probably still has, a very special place in American culture and society. Yet, being so far away, most Americans could not even conceive of making such a long, expensive, and dangerous journey. Hence the geographical image of the Holy Land was based upon indirect media such as maps, travelers' books, paintings, models, photographs (especially stereographic ones), lectures, homilies, and other sorts of media. These image-creating media became highly important and influential in American society, and their story is told in this book. The heart of the book is dedicated to several types of such image-making media, and therefore it is in fact a book about the people and organizations that produced them and promoted them among Americans. It is a study of those pro- moters of images as agents of knowledge, ideas, and concepts. It describes and an- alyzes their operations and motivations, their manipulations and ideologies, their successes and failures, and their impact in creating the conceptual image, or, ac- tually, various images, of the Holy Land within certain circles of American soci- ety. The book tells the story of those people, some of them in great detail. It seems to me that this is its main virtue. The description of the large-scale model of Jerusalem at the St. Louis World's Fair (1904) is extremely vivid and attractive. It is well told, depicting the atmosphere when Madame Lydia Mameroff von Finkelstein Mountford gave her biblical shows (pp. 56-59) and how the "Biblical strongman Samson died from gunshot wounds" (p. 66). The same is true for the details quoted from the letters of Charles Foster Kent, describing his travels in Palestine, which included what he ate and how many mosquito bites he suffered (p. 93ff.). Many other such incidents are described throughout the book. The book is arranged in five chapters: The first tells the history of the Chau- tauqua institution in upstate New York, where a large park was built in the shape of a three-dimensional map of Palestine. This park played a central part in the fa- mous educational activity that took place there. The second chapter describes the large-scale model of Jerusalem built in the St. Louis World's Fair and contrasts it with the modern "New Holy Land" in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. The third chap- ter discusses the parlor tours where lectures and stereoscopic photographs were used in order to create a "real" geographic image of the Holy Land. The author an- alyzes in detail how this "real" image was, of course, manipulated by the photog- raphers, editors, and lecturers to convey their own ideas and values. The fourth chapter is entitled "Landscape and Democracy," but its main fo- cus is William Foxwell Albright and other members of the American School of Ori- ental Research. Here the author describes how "science," that is, archaeology and Bible studies, were also used to promote values and sociopolitical positions. The fifth chapter is apparently about maps and the power of cartography in image mak- ing, but it is focused on the historical atlases of Coleman (1850) and Wright and Filson (1945). These two atlases were distributed in large numbers, and each of them was popular for many decades. As maps are believed by many to be "scien- 396</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews tific" and "objective" documents, these two atlases were powerful in promoting ideas and creating value-laden images of the Holy Land. Although the book is very well written, and the stories of those many peo- ple and institutions, image-makers, map-makers, model-makers, scholars, theolo- gians, entrepreneurs and travelers are fascinating, four shortcomings should be pointed out: 1. The book overlooks almost everything that is not American, and thus dis- cusses the American arena omitting the larger context. Alas, the rediscovery of the Holy Land by western civilization, especially during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was not limited to America. On the contrary, much of the important ac- tivity took place in Europe and in England.' This overwhelming European activi- ty also had a strong impact on the American activity in numerous ways. 2. Even within the American context, the book deals only with Protestant groups and institutions. However, in some of the Catholic Universities in the Unit- ed States there were, and still are, important centers for Bible and Ancient Semit- ic languages. Moreover, in the same years that Albright and his followers were active in biblical archaeology, Nelson Glueck surveyed both sides of the Jordan and the Negev desert. Did he, and others, have no impact in creating and distrib- uting alternative images of the Land of the Bible? Does black traditional music, especially spirituals like "Jordan river is deep and wide / Milk and honey on the other side" not reflect a geographic conceptual image of the "Promised Land"? 3. The book describes and analyzes several channels of image making like models, photography, cartography, archaeological and biblical studies, and so forth. However, it overlooks some other channels such as literature and visual arts. Mark Twain, certainly a different voice compared to Protestant romanticism, is mentioned only briefly, while Herman Melville, one of the famous American au- thors who traveled to Palestine, is not mentioned at all.2 The same is true for paint- ing and lithography, which were common at the time, and had a considerable visual impact.3 4. Finally, there are some important issues that are missing even if we accept the line of discussion chosen by the author. Among the models, the complicated model of the Temple Mount, built by C. Schick and bought by the Ashmoliean Mu- seum in Harvard in 1904, which was probably exhibited also in St. Louis, is not even mentioned.4 The same is true for the first American traveler to Palestine in 1.

In conclusion, discussion of the process and development of the image of the Holy Land in American society, and particularly the use of "surrogate travels," is very interesting,7 especially in the American context where this concept is still strong and alive (as in EPCOT, in Disney World). This book would have been even better had it been more comprehensive. Rehav Rubin Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel</page></plain_text>
