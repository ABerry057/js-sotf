Eerdmans, 1998. xx, 230 pp. Boccaccini makes two important contributions in this work: he employs the methods of intellectual history to give a novel account of the origins of the Qum- ran community and he seeks to overcome the supersessionism characteristic of Christian studies of ancient Judaism. Boccaccini tells a story of three schisms. First came "an ancient schism with- in the Jewish priesthood between Enochians and Zadokites" (p. 78), groups with "directly opposed" (p. 72) ideologies. Second, after a post-Maccabean Revolt ap- propriation of Zadokite traditions by some Enochians (reflected in Jubilees and the Temple Scroll), came "the birth of a schismatic group" (p. 114) of Enochians dis- satisfied with the Zadokite establishment (reflected in the Halakhic Letter). Third came the formation of a sect with Enochic roots, "the schism between Qumran and Enochic Judaism" (p. 119).1 Other discussions of the Enochian/Zadokite division are cited, but Boccac- cini's formulation seems more extreme: "The Enochians completely ignore the Mosaic torah and the Jerusalem temple" (p. 74). This seems incompatible with Kugler's characterization of early dispute as "still quite tame ... [with] room for differences of opinion," and with Himmelfarb's characterization of Enoch as "deeply devoted to the ideal of the temple understood in a quite concrete way," both cited for support (p. 78). Indeed, the claim that Enochians "ignored" the torah of 1. For helpful discussion of Boccaccini on the origins of the Qumran community, see J.C. Van- derKam, "A Response to G.

Henoch (forthcoming, 2000). 352</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Enoch's "rival Moses" (p. 74) is supported only by an argument from silence: 1 Enoch's omission of the Mosaic covenant and the gift of torah. It is unclear what such omissions prove, especially since Boccaccini does not explain which tradi- tions and laws were then thought to comprise "Mosaic torah." He acknowledges "a common mythological heritage shared by both Enochians and Zadokites" (p. 77), but regards pentateuchal traditions as "Zadokite torah" (p. 71). When these traditions were redacted, and how much pentateuchal law Enochians shared, are left unclear. Boccaccini's assertion of ideological opposition seems driven by the desire to emulate "the study of the history of competing philosophical positions in an- tiquity" (p. xiv). But the distinctive character of text production, redaction, and transmission in ancient Judaism renders the application of such a model problem- atic. The complex interrelations between shared traditions implies that any divi- sion into two "directly opposed" schools must go beyond the evidence. Boccaccini has an explanation for texts in which Enochic and Zadokite ele- ments mingle: Jubilees and the Temple Scroll testify to an innovative attempt by Enochians to appropriate Zadokite torah. But there is no evidence that the min- gling is innovative unless the earlier thesis of an ideological schism is accepted. "Rewritten bibles" may be viewed not as attempts to replace established penta- teuchal texts, but, rather, as late products of the redactional and interpretive process that also produced biblical texts.2 Boccaccini claims that the Temple Scroll "does not recognize the Mosaic torah as its source. It claims to be an independent revelation from God that drew its authority from the same archetype, the heavenly tablets" (p. 100). In fact, the Scroll explicitly acknowledges neither Mosaic torah nor the heavenly tablets in- voked in Jubilees as the source of its authority. But Boccaccini's dualistic history requires that it acknowledge one or the other. He thinks that it acknowledges the tablets because of its intellectual affinities with Enochic Judaism and Jubilees in particular (pp. 100-101). However, he ignores the possibility that to interpretive- ly recast pentateuchal traditions was to acknowledge Mosaic torah as one's source. To privilege intellectual affinities over exegetical and redactional relations is to im- pose the methods of the history of ancient schools on the culture of ancient Ju- daism. Boccaccini's preface eloquently attests to his interest in Jewish-Christian friendship and his desire to undo the effect upon Second Temple research of"a cul- tural pattern that for confessional reasons aimed to present Christianity and Ju- daism as separate and independent monoliths" (p. xiii). However, he avoids por- traying Second Temple Judaism as either proto-Christian or proto-Rabbinic by portraying it as both. This avoids being narrowly confessional, but still appears anachronistic. We must await a forthcoming book for his views on the origins of Rabbinic Judaism. But it is clear from this book that, although he rejects the in- terpretation of the Qumran community as proto-Christian, he views the Christians as "the most direct heirs of Enochic Judaism," while "the rabbis . . . fiercely op- 2.

This view overstates both the continuity between Enochic Ju- daism and Christianity and the discontinuity with Rabbinic Judaism. Enochic as- pects of rabbinic merkavah traditions are unmentioned, while the gradual deem- phasis of Enochic traditions within the Church is explained as follows: "If most Churches gradually rejected those [ancient Essene] documents from their canons, it was because the Church's confrontation with Rabbinic Judaism did not encour- age a relation with a movement that the Church's direct competitors considered only a nest of heretics" (p. 190). No evidence is given either for the ascription of this attitude to the rabbis or for the influence of rabbinic views about heresy upon the Church. Boccaccini attempts to avoid confessional history of Second Temple Ju- daism, in which "the literature of the period was forced into confessionally divid- ed corpora only to serve as weapons for theological disputes" (p. xiii). However, the effect of his division between Enochian and Zadokite schools of thought is to make his own study oddly reminiscent of the kind of history he rejects. The dif- ference is that, where others have divided Second Temple literature into confes- sionally divided corpora for the sake of contemporary theological disputes, Boc- caccini sees the Second Temple period itself as the scene of theological disputes between two confessional groups with their own textual corpora. His provocative account, situated within a complex overview of the origins of both Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism, will stimulate discussion for years to come.
