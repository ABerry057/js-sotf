<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS OF THE JEWISH REFORM MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND By ROBERT LIBERLES Jewish Theological Seminary of America to Jack Gross Bi-yedidut I England's first reform synagogue, the West London Synagogue of British Jews, was founded in April 1840.1 References to this event in the various histories differ from each other only in small detail.2 These ac- counts all trace the roots of the new synagogue to internal dissension within Bevis Marks, the Sephardi congregation in London. David Philipson dated the call for reforms back to an 1812 critique of the lack of decorum during prayers.3 In 1836 a petition was submitted calling for changes 1.

In 1838, as a response to growing unrest, Bevis Marks formed a committee "for promoting Order and Solemnity in the Synagogue." But counter-pressures arose, resulting in the formation of the "Shomere Mish- meret AKodesh," a society "for supporting and upholding the Jewish religion as handed down to us by our revered ancestors and to prevent innovations or changes in any of its recognized forms and customs unless sanctioned by the recognized authorities." An 1840 petition called for the establishment of a branch synagogue in London's- West End which would introduce a number of the suggested reforms. When it was re- jected, plans to establish a separate synagogue were formulated.5 There are several noteworthy characteristics of this interpretation, which is essentially repeated in all accounts of the events which culminated in the formation of the reform synagogue in 1840. First, the process is por- trayed exclusively as a trend of religious events. But the drama of history is acted out simultaneously on the multiple stages of human experience. A political revolution can be understood only by enlarging our perspective from the political arena to a broader focus on the political, economic, and social platforms. A religious revolution must be similarly understood-that is, the historical event of the founding of the West London Synagogue must be explained through consideration of the categories that historians use for explaining any other event. A second characteristic of the accepted interpretation is that the rise of the reform movement is seen essentially as a Sephardi phenomenon, stemming from internal dissent within Bevis Marks. Even Cecil Roth, who approached the subject from an Ashkenazi perspective in his history of the Great Synagogue, states this assumption explicitly: "Previous to this [April, 1840] the controversy had been an internal affair of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue; now the Ashkenazi synagogues were in- evitably drawn into it." 6 This picture of Ashkenazi "fellow travelers" fails to take into con- sideration the motivations and objectives of six members of the original congregation of twenty-four. It must furthermore be appreciated that men 4. Ibid., p. 94; Hyamson, op. cit., pp. 273-74. See also Gaster, op. cit., pp. 171- 72. 5. Philipson, op. cit., p. 95; Hyamson, op. cit., p. 280. 6.

Rather, it can be assumed that the Ashkenazi contingent approached the formation of the reform synagogue with its own objectives. This assump- tion is only underscored by the fact that Goldsmid's involvement in the original planning was apparently deep enough to warrant his assumption of the leadership of the new congregation once it was formed.8 Reverend David Marks, the first minister of the synagogue, wrote of Goldsmid: "To him more than to any one else, we owe it that our congregation was ushered into being."9 The failure to note, until recently, the significance of the Ashkenazic contingent 10 results from a more general deficiency in the study of Jewish religious movements-the failure to identify the participants in these movements and to correlate movement participation with the totality of their social position. A great deal of bitterness surrounded the establishment of the reform synagogue. James Picciotto referred to these events as "the most painful episode in modern Anglo-Jewish history.""l Haham Moses Gaster por- trayed the social framework in which the controversy took place: This cry [for reform] was taken up, though faintly at the beginning by that section of the community which had lived so long in London, as to feel themselves entirely English, and who therefore could be in sympathy with that movement on the Continent and were stimu- 7.

See also Harold Pollins, "The Jews' Role in Early British Rail- ways," Jewish Social Studies, XV (1953), 53-62. 8. Several writers have mistakenly referred to Goldsmid as the first president of the congregation. However, no such position existed at that time. David Mocatta served as chairman of the Council from the Synagogue's establishment until Feb- ruary 4, 1866, when he was succeeded by Goldsmid. ("The West London Synagogue," manuscript in Synagogue archives, p. 10.) It appears from the Minute Book that it was Mocatta's position that was "honorary," while Goldsmid, as one of three wardens and as Honorary Secretary, executed most of the organizational details. The Council recognized Goldsmid's primary role within the Synagogue when it awarded him a testimonial in April 1842. West London Synagogue Minute Book, pp. 72-73. 9.

Thus to the jealousy which was growing up between the two sections of the community, the one which had lived longer in England, and which had come directly from Spain and Portugal, and those who, although of Spanish and Portuguese descent, were comparatively new comers, was now added a difference of religious conception .. .12 These descriptions reveal some sensitivity to the fundamentals of the controversy, which, in fact, stretched far beyond the religious differences between two segments of the membership of Bevis Marks. Its manifesta- tion in the religious sector represented merely the peak of an iceberg, whose vast foundation lay in the social and political components of Anglo- Jewry. II In April 1840, twenty-four gentlemen-eighteen members of the Se- phardi community and six members of the Ashkenazi Great Synagogue- met to discuss the founding of a reform synagogue in the West End of London.'3 Since that time the event has been described as the result of inner strife within the Sephardi community.14 But what of the motivations that brought their Ashkenazi counterparts to the identical decision that a reform synagogue was needed? This problem has been almost totally overlooked by secondary writers.'" Of the six Ashkenazi members, the most prominent in Anglo-Jewish life was Francis H. Goldsmid, the son of Isaac Lyon Goldsmid.'6 The elder Goldsmid was a pillar of the Ashkenazi community. A one-time warden of the Great Synagogue, he had served as the leading figure in the Jewish drive for emancipation. His son Francis had recently emerged 12. Gaster, op. cit., pp. 168-69. 13.

Gold- smid published several pamphlets arguing the case for Jewish emancipa- tion,1s and in 1833 Goldsmid became the first Jew admitted to the British bar.'" In 1837 Goldsmid sued for a reversal of the da Costa versus de Pat decision of 1744. In that first case, the court declared invalid the provision of the will of Elias de Paz, who had bequeathed a sum of money to a yeshivah in England. The court's reasoning was that the Jewish religion "is not taken notice of by any law but is barely connived at by the Legisla- ture." 20 The 1837 case involved an inheritance left to the Great Synagogue for distribution at Passover time to ten needy families. The Attorney- General argued the illegality of the bequest on the basis of the da Costa versus de Paz decision.21 Goldsmid's victory in this case must be seen as a stepping stone to the ultimate reversal of the de Paz decision in 1846.22 In the years immediately before the establishment of the West.London Synagogue, the Goldsmids-Isaac Lyon and his son Francis H.--were involved in a growing controversy with the Board of Deputies of British Jews over policy in the struggle for political emancipation. In 1838 Isaac Lyon Goldsmid sent a letter to the Great Synagogue pro- testing against a clause in the constitution of the Board of Deputies which declared the Board "to be the only official medium of communication with Government in matters concerning the political interests of the British Jews." 23 Goldsmid's membership in the Great Synagogue, one of 17.

In November 1838 the letter was forwarded by the Great Synagogue to the Board. In his attack on the restriction, Goldsmid spoke of the contributions by notable individuals to the emancipation struggle. The clause in question would have prevented personalities such as Barnard Van Oven, David Salomons, and Goldsmid himself from continuing their work. And of the Board of Deputies, Goldsmid wrote, "What during the progress of all these changes has been accomplished or attempted by the Deputies . . .? The answer is decisive. Nothing!" 25 Goldsmid protested both the cen- tralization of power within the Board, as well as its inactivity despite its usurpation of power. The Board, which responded by inviting both Goldsmid and his son to appear before a meeting of the Deputies, acceded to their demands by repealing the clause in question."2 Nevertheless, in 1839, when the Great Synagogue elected Isaac Goldsmid a delegate to the Board, he declined the position. This friction between the Goldsmids and the Board of Deputies developed further just prior to the formation of the reform congregation. At the beginning of 1840, the Board sent a congratulatory address to Queen Victoria on the occasion of her wedding. Members of the Board were reportedly disturbed that the Maiden Lane Synagogue addressed the Queen in a separate communication. The Board's reaction was ap- parently intensified by the disclosure that the offending document had been presented by I. L. Goldsmid, whose relations with the Board were already "somewhat strained." "7 The chronology of these events brings us to the early months of 1840, 24. Ibid., p. 30. 25. An abridged text of the letter may be found in Lionel Abrahams, "Sir I. L. Goldsmid and the Admission of the Jews of England to Parliament," Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England, IV (1899-1901), pp. 172-75. 26. Emanuel, op. cit., p. 32. The Goldsmid accusation concerning the Board's inactivity on behalf of the cause of emancipation was not always totally justified, as will be discussed below. 27. Ibid., p. 33. The Maiden Lane Synagogue had left the Board of Deputies in January, 1839. Emanuel does not explain its reasons for secession. When the Sunder- land (Synagogue resigned its membership in April, 1839, Emanuel asserts that the cause was financial. But since these resignations came at a time of dissension within the British Jewish community over the policies of the Board, it is possible that they imply a broader base of dissent than has been observed until now. In the case of the Maiden Lane Synagogue, some additional evidence is suggestive and will be discussed below.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT LIBERLES 127 when the organizational meeting for the reform synagogue was held. In the preceding years, the Board had attempted to carve out a policy of increased centralization of power. The Goldsmids, however, resisted that policy. Some writers have failed to understand I. L. Goldsmid's refusal in 1839 to accept a seat on the Board. Emanuel's comment is typical: "This [the revocation of the constitutional clause] apparently was not considered by Mr. Goldsmid to be sufficient, and when elected a Deputy for the Great Synagogue in the following year he declined the appointment." 2s Goldsmid had, after all, protested not only the prohibition against indi- vidual efforts, but also the moderate policies and cumbersome procedures of the Board. The Board's accession to his demands to be able to con- tinue to negotiate with the government on behalf of political emancipation would have been meaningless if he had then affiliated with the Board. As a member, he might have felt a greater obligation to acquiesce to their policies. By refusing the position, Goldsmid affirmed that he would con- tinue to follow a policy as active and as radical as he wished. His trans- mission of the Maiden Lane note to the Queen in 1840 constituted an assertion of his independence. Thus, the conflict between the Goldsmids and the Board of Deputies intensified as the 1830s progressed. We have accumulated a certain amount of circumstantial evidence that the con- troversy over the reform synagogue was, in fact, an extension of the con- troversy between the Goldsmids and the Board of Deputies over the Board's moderation in pursuing the fight for emancipation. The previously accepted notion that the schism was born within the walls of Bevis Marks has recently been challenged.29 The chronology of events discussed above provides a plausible narrative culminating in the formation of the synagogue while making no reference to the move- ment for religious reforms within Bevis Marks. It is important to observe who, in fact, led the controversy over the new synagogue. The established Jewish communal structure issued two significant re- sponses to the anouncement that a reform congregation would be formed. In January 1842 the rabbinical authorities, headed by Rabbi Hirschell of the Great Synagogue, issued a "Caution" against the reformers having 28. Emanuel, op. cit., p. 32. 29. See especially J. M. Shaftesley, "Religious Controversies," in A Century of Anglo-Jewish Life, 1870-1970 (London, n.d.), pp. 93-113. The origins of this ap- proach can be traced to Finestein, op. cit.</page><page sequence="8">128 REFORM MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND "any communion with us Israelites in any religious rite or sacred act." 30 In February 1842 the Board of Deputies refused to "register" the new congregation, thus preventing its secretary, Reverend David Marks, from performing wedding ceremonies. According to the Voice of Jacob's ac- count, Moses Montefiore, the president of the Board of Deputies, had no choice but to follow the views of the rabbinical leadership."2 But another view attributes to Montefiore much greater initiative in opposing the re- formers.32 Picciotto asserted that the ecclesiastical authorities who issued the "Caution" were, in fact, pressured to do so: We are informed by unimpeachable authorities that the Rev. S. Hirschell, as well as the Rev. D. Meldola, senior Dayan of the Portu- guese Congregation, signed the above paper with the greatest reluc- tance, knowing that it would cause much exasperation, that it would sow dissension when peace was sought and desired, and that it would tend to convert a temporary difference into an irreconcilable enmity. But the reverend gentlemen yielded to the powerful influences brought to bear upon them .. 3 If Picciotto is correct, then Montefiore did not merely follow the counsels of the authorities, but rather pressed for the "Caution" which freed him to refuse to register the reform synagogue. In either case, it was the presi- dent of the Board of Deputies, not the warden of Bevis Marks, who led the opposition to the reformers.3" To summarize, the personalities involved in the conflict were F. H. Goldsmid as warden of the West London Synagogue and Moses Monte- fiore as president of the Board of Deputies. On neither side do we find the protagonists to be expected if the conflict were, indeed, restricted to an 30. See Picciotto, op. cit., pp. 373-74. The text of the "Caution" was printed in the Voice of Jacob, I (February 4, 1842), 76-77. 31. Voice of Jacob, I (February 18, 1842), 81-82. 32. The Voice of Jacob defended Montefiore by referring to Article II of the constitution of the Board of Deputies, which it cited: "The guidance of the com- munity in religious matters shall remain, as heretofore, with the Ecclesiastical au- thorities." The paper concludes: "Hence, it was not only, no 'misuse of power' by the Chairman of the Board, but it was imperative upon him to obey the instruc- tions above referred to." Voice of Jacob, I (March 18, 1842), 101. It may be deduced from the Voice's defense that there were those who thought that Montefiore had indeed "misused his powers." 33. Picciotto, op. cit., p. 374. 34. Abraham Mocatta, warden of Bevis Marks, actually opposed the reading of the "Caution" in the Sephardi synagogue.

But if the conflict was, in fact, over the emancipation struggle, what connection could there be between protesting the policies of the Board and establishing a reform synagogue? A discus- sion of several documents will provide more conclusive evidence that such a connection did exist and some insight into what that connection was. In 1830 the Jewish Relief Bill, which called for the repeal of the civil disabilities of the Jews, met with defeat in Parliament. In 1831 I. L. Goldsmid petitioned the Board of Deputies to request total emancipation from Parliament. Montefiore's diaries record the following exchange: Mr. Montefiore informed Dr. Lushington that he was sure the Deputies, if asked, would gladly accept anything the Government might offer, however short of the repeal of all their disabilities. Lord Holland, who was afterwards consulted by Mr. I. L. Goldsmid, con- curred in opinion with Dr. Lushington. Mr. Montefiore here observes that Mr. I. L. Goldsmid was greatly displeased with the Deputies, saying that he did not care about the measure, and would establish a new Synagogue with the assistance of the young men; he would alter the present form of prayer to that in use in the Synagogue at Hamburg."35 Several important deductions can be made from this document. The protagonists were I. L. Goldsmid and Moses Montefiore-the latter in his role as a leader, though not yet president, of the Board of Deputies.36 The argument was over the Board's attitude of moderation in the emancipation struggle. At the conclusion of the exchange, Goldsmid declared that he would establish a reform synagogue. Thus, while we have not yet discussed what the connection was between dissatisfaction with the Board of Depu- ties and establishing a reform synagogue, this document does confirm that such a connection, in fact, existed. It is apparent that Goldsmid intended the proposed synagogue as an al- ternative to the Board of Deputies. This suggestion that I. L. Goldsmid was searching for an alternative political structure to the Board of Deputies can be supported by reference to two other attempts in this same direction. First, in 1830 Goldsmid founded the Jewish Association for obtaining 35. Dr. L. Loewe, Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore, I (Chicago, 1890), 82-83. 36. The president at this time was Moses Mocatta, who served from 1829 to 1835, when he was succeeded by his nephew, Moses Montefiore.

The Deputies extended a courteous invitation to Mr. David Salomons, and any of "the few gentlemen" who had met to pass the resolution who so desired, to a conference to be held later with their Body, and a pressing invita- tion was also extended to Mr. I. L. Goldsmid and his son, Mr. F. H. Goldsmid, to cooperate. The conference took place, and besides the Deputies, there were present, in answer to the Board's invitation, Messrs. D. Salomons, I. L. Goldsmid, F. H. Goldsmid, and B. Van Oven.39 It is somewhat unclear whether or not the Goldmids actually attended the Salomons meeting. But it is clear that the Goldsmids were identified with an outside pressure group prompting the Board to further action. It should be noted that F. H. Goldsmid was also invited by the Board, indicating his growing stature as a fighter for emancipation. The above evidence implies that throughout the 1830s the Goldsmids did not accept the total authority of the Board of Deputies in pursuing the fight for emancipation. Finestein has suggested that the Board's adoption of a constitution in March 1836, prohibiting individuals from negotiating with the government, was a direct response to Goldsmid's independent activities. In this light, the Salomons meeting, which was held in June of that year, becomes of even greater interest since it represents an almost immediate repudiation of the new constitution." Goldsmid's remark in 1831 that he would form a synagogue alterna- tive to the Board represents only one of several forms he could and did 37. Marks, Memoir, p. 23. 38. Salomons had been elected Sheriff of London in 1835. In December 1836 he was elected alderman, but was unable to serve in this capacity because of his religion.

However, the formation of a new synagogue would represent not only a secession from the Board of Deputies, but also a secession from the synagogue to which Goldsmid belonged as well. Goldsmid's 1838 letter to the Great Synagogue, protesting the restrictions of the Board's constitution, reveals the inner strife which Goldsmid was undergoing: Ever since the adoption of the late regulations for the new forma- tion of the Board of Deputies entitled "the Deputies of the British Jews," I have felt that in these regulations it was impossible for me to acquiesce. I have hitherto, however, abstained from taking any decided step in consequence of my entertaining a slight hope that some modifications might have been effected by which the necessity of any such step would have been spared. But as the arrival of the period when the customary payments are made by members of the synagogue renders it indispensable that I should determine what course I am to pursue, I can no longer defer a full explanation of my sentiments on the subject .... While this regulation [forbidding individuals from negotiating with the government on political matters] contradicts itself, and has no real meaning with regard to the Jews resident out of London, and whom it cannot be seriously supposed to bind, the matter is worse as it respects Jews who do not subscribe to the London Synagogues, and who, if they continue to subscribe to them, may be held to be bound by the regulations they have adopted. Goldsmid was obliged to abide by the Board's regulations because he was a member of the Great Synagogue. Secession from the synagogue would, at least in his view, have liberated him from the authority of the Board. He concluded his letter with a statement of his intentions and his feelings: But when I find the first acknowledgment of my services in the adoption of a regulation which, if acquiesced in, would make it almost impracticable for me or others who are younger than I now am to render similar services for the future, I am reluctantly com- pelled to state what I have done and at the same time to say that I cannot possibly consent to entrust my political interests to the charge of the Deputies. To be forced to separate from a body with which my father and family have been connected for very many years, and with which as a religious and charitable society I desire still to remain in connection, would cause me the deepest concern ... .41 41. See note 25 above.</page><page sequence="12">132 REFORM MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND One source, the Montefiore diary, which confirmed the formation of a synagogue alternative, dated back to 1831. But I. L. Goldsmid chose first to try different paths which would enable him to remain within the Great Synagogue. The second document provides us with additional evi- dence. We now have a source closer to the event in question which confirms that protesting the policies of the Board might require resigning from one's synagogue and presumably establishing a new congregation. However, the relationship between establishing a new synagogue and protesting the Board's policies is different in the two sources. In the first source (1831), Goldsmid implied that the new synagogue would rival the Board of Depu- ties and would be integrally connected with the emancipation struggle. There is no such reference in the later document. Rather, it informs us that any individual who chose not to subject himself to the restrictions and policies of the Board of Deputies would have to resign from his own synagogue in order to be exempted. The first source represents the more radical statement. Later events showed it also to be the more foretelling. On January 23, 1845, the Board of Deputies passed a resolution call- ing for increased emancipation efforts.42 On February 19, 1845, Sir Moses Montefiore headed a delegation representing the Board of Deputies and attained an interview with Prime Minister Peel.43 Shortly thereafter, a second delegation, headed by Sir Isaac Goldsmid and essentially repre- senting the Burton Street Synagogue (the West London Synagogue), ap- peared before the Prime Minister. According to the Jewish Chronicle, a meeting held at Sir Isaac Goldsmid's house on February 23 had decided that the delegation would consist of representatives of the Burton-Street Synagogue, as well as some gentlemen not members of the synagogue, but who sympathized with the congregants of Burton-Street, in the anomalous position in which they had been placed by the Board of Deputies, with regard to their civil and religious rights.44 It should be noted that even Sir Isaac Goldsmid himself was not yet at this time a member of the reform congregation though certainly closely attached to its work.45 The delegation consisted of Sir Isaac Goldsmid, 42.

Henriques, Moses Mocatta, and Daniel Mocatta.46 In sending a separate delegation to the Prime Minister, the West London Synagogue undertook to fulfill a strictly political function delegated by others to the Board of Deputies. While, in part, the plea to Peel served to make known to the Prime Minister the discrimination suffered by the reform congregation at the hands of the Deputies, its original objective was to present a more radical statement of demands for British Jews. It is of significance for our discussion to note that the Jewish Chronicle reports "we are informed that a private note, which accompanied the me- morial of Sir Isaac, held forth that the Board of Deputies do not repre- sent all the British Jews." " The support given to the elder Goldsmid in organizing a separate mission to Peel in 1845 implies an extension of the earlier hypothesis. It may now be asserted that the members-at-large of the West London Synagogue perceived its role not merely as a religious alternative to the established services at Bevis Marks and the Great Synagogue, but also as a political alternative to the Board of Deputies. Not only do the mem- bers give support to the 1845 delegation, but there is evidence that they were conscious of the political objectives of the new institution at its very founding. By April 1840 Francis Goldsmid was already established as a major advocate of the Jewish emancipation struggle. He had, furthermore, already encountered some strains in his relationship with the Board of Deputies. The classical interpretation of the secession depicts a slow and difficult decision of the Sephardim to separate from Bevis Marks-a decision which, it is suggested, was reversible if the parent congregation would agree to certain religious reforms.48 This interpretation does not adequately explain why a group attempting to maintain a link with the Sephardi community would choose as its president a controversial per- sonality, like F. H. Goldsmid, a personality who was already at odds with the Sephardi leadership, which dominated the Board of Deputies.49 In selecting Goldsmid as president, the synagogue publicly manifested its intention to provide the more radical protagonists in the emancipation struggle with a base of operations. 46.

The Goldsmids and Mocattas had had intimate business connections dating back over fifty years."l The two contingents did not accidentally decide simultaneously upon religious reform. Nor did the idea of secession originate with the Sephardim and then spontaneously appeal to the Goldsmids. We have seen that secession was discussed almost a decade before and at that time it was being advocated by the Goldsmids. The Sephardim must have come to the new synagogue with some degree of commitment to the political functions envisioned by the Goldsmids. Direct support for this hypothesis can be found in a letter of August 24, 1841, from the Sephardi seceders to the Elders of Bevis Marks. In the course of a lengthy justification of their actions, the seceders remarked: One of the benefits anticipated by us from the establishment we are forming, is that the junction of members of different congregations, to which we have already adverted, will lead to the abolition of the useless distinctions now existing in relation to those who are termed Portuguese and German Jews, but who, in fact, are neither Portu- guese nor German, but natives, and, in many instances, descendants of natives of the British empire, and we have accordingly given the intended place of worship, the designation of "West London Syna- gogue of British Jews." 52 The very name of the synagogue comes to affirm, according to these Sephardi members, that this is a British synagogue with no commitments to alien cultures. This affirmation of British identity negates the charge that Jews are essentially aliens in the lands in which they live.53 In refuting this charge, the Sephardim are participating in the emancipation struggle and supporting the Goldsmid position a year before the congregation ever opened its doors."4 But here it may be necessary to distinguish between the two contingents. The primary objective of the Goldsmids was not to secede from the Great Synagogue, nor to inaugurate a reform service, but to secede from 50. Ibid., p. 280. 51. Paul H.

The Sephardim, however, demanded the intro- duction of reforms, while, as we have seen, they were sympathetic to the Goldsmid cause. What bound these two contingents together was their primary commitment to the struggle for political emancipation.55 The Goldsmids required a power base for their diplomatic activities. The Sephardim saw the introduction of reforms as the stepping-stone to political rights. The final product, the West London Synagogue, represented a merging of both views. The Goldsmids, too, had seen the importance of reform, as demonstrated by I. L. Goldsmid's 1831 statement. We have discussed the necessity of forming a synagogue unaffiliated with the Board. But what was the purpose of the specific reforms that were called for? It is that problem to which we now turn our attention. III While Anglo-Jewish historians speak of the secession in almost tragic terms,56 representatives of the reform movement, who are in a position to compare the British endeavors with those of their counterparts in Germany and America, speak of the moderation of the British reformers. David Philipson remarked in his History of the Reform Movement: The changes [in the prayer book issued by the congregation in 1841] consisted mostly in abbreviation and eliminations whereby the service was shortened. . . . The most significant change possibly was the rendering of the Aramaic portions notably the Kaddish prayer into Hebrew. . . . The editors of the book were quite right when they asserted that the service they had adopted was altogether based on the existing ritual with the exception of the few slight changes men- tioned.. .. 7 Jakob Petuchowski has commented: The agitations in England, far from calling into question the tradi- tional theology, merely aimed at introducing greater decorum into the worship service. . . . How little of real radicalism there was in- 55. The supposed indifference of London's Sephardim to the emancipation struggle must be questioned. The example of Montefiore himself contradicts this notion. What can be said, at most, is that the Sephardim were less involved in direct diplomatic activity of the kind pursued by Rothschild, Salomons, and the Goldsmids. 56. See above, pp. 123-24. 57. Philipson, op. cit., p. 101.</page><page sequence="16">136 REFORM MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND volved in all of this becomes apparent once we realize that, even when the Reform synagogue was finally established in 1842, no doc- trinal changes were made in the prayers.58 Even the Anglo-Jewish writers, in asserting that a less severe response would have avoided the breach, are implying that the changes requested were such that compromise was possible.59 Paradoxically then, the very historians who portray the founding of the West London synagogue as a purely religious phenomenon must simultaneously admit that the synagogue introduced only moderate reforms-thus underscoring the need for an alternative interpretation. What reforms did the new congregation introduce? In a letter sent to the Elders of Bevis Marks on August 24, 1841, the proposed reforms were discussed.6o The seceders called for the following changes: 1. to begin services at a more convenient hour 2. to shorten the services 3. to introduce weekly discourses in English 4. to discontinue the practice of "calling up" to the Torah 5. to eliminate the observance of the Second Day of Festivals The first two changes were introduced "to preserve proper decorum during the performance of divine worship" 61 by eliminating late arrivals and early departures from the synagogue. The reformers also sought to elimi- nate the practice of members of the congregation rising from their places to be called before the Torah so "that they should not, by occasioning interruptions to the reading of the law, mar its effect." 62 Three of the changes were, therefore, intended to increase decorum during the service. The English discourse was intended to fill similar needs. "To familiarize the rising generation with a knowledge of the great principles of our holy faith, to teach them their duty as Israelites, and as men, must be considered one of the primary objects of public worship."

The abolishment of the Second Day of the Festivals will be considered below. The other significant change is found in the very name of the new congregation- a name which broke with the traditional separation of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities.66 In September 1844, Benjamin Elkin, one of the synagogue's leading spokesmen, wrote in a letter later published in the Jewish Chronicle: "You allude to our designation of 'British Jews.' By this appellation we have happily merged the absurd and untrue distinction of German and Portuguese Jews. We are Englishmen, consequently British Jews." 67 To whom were the reformers responding by emphasizing their British identity? A suggestion may be found in the writings of the congregation's warden, F. H. Goldsmid. In his pamphlets, Goldsmid attacked the primary objections against emancipating the Jews. Against the argument that "Jews consider themselves as a separate nation, and that their religion forbids their political identification with the state in which they live," 68 Goldsmid responded that the concept of Jewish nationhood applied to the past history of Biblical times and to the future, Messianic times. But con- cerning the present, Goldsmid maintained: "They do not, as seems to have been imagined-they cannot, believe, that they have now any political existence or political interest distinct from those of the country in which they live." 69 The objections Goldsmid answered in his 1831 pamphlet permeate his 64. Philipson, op. cit., pp. 92-93. 65. Materials related to the establishment of the Reformed Society of Israelites in Charleston, South Carolina, have increased my understanding of the significance of the sermon in the reform service. In contrast with the specific laws of the weekly Torah portion, the sermon was intended to provide a more synthetic view of Jewish teachings and practices. In this sense, it probably should be understood as being related to the catechisms written by reform spokesmen. 66. See above, p. 134. 67. Jewish Chronicle, I (March 21, 1845), 124. 68. F. H.

As late as 1848 he still wrote that there were only two objections to Lord Russel's bill for Jewish rights. The first objection was that the Jews form a separate nation: "that there is something in their religion which forbids their complete political identifica- tion with the country in which they were born and bred." 0 It is, then, not unreasonable to assert that in 1840, Goldsmid was concerned over the view that Jews could not be loyal to the British government. A correlative for Goldsmid's reading of British public opinion can be found in a two-volume description of London life which coincided precisely with the events we are describing.7' The apparent author, James Grant, was the editor of several popular journals and author of numerous popular books.7" Despite the fact that this particular work appeared a decade after Goldsmid's first pamphlets, Grant observed that "the Jews, as a nation or community, take very little interest in politics. We scarcely ever hear a complaint from any of their number on the subject of their civil disabilities, great as these are. . . ." While Salomons and Goldsmid have argued on behalf of emancipation, nevertheless, Grant continued, "as a body they have never evinced any anxiety to be put in possession of the same political and civil privileges as are enjoyed by other classes of the community. . . ."7" Grant's explanation for this indifference is significant for our argument: The reason is to be found in the fact that they consider themselves a distinct nation, no matter how widely they may be scattered over the world; and that they expect to be all speedily restored to the land of their fathers, for the Jews have, ever since their original dispersion in our first century, clung to the hope of speedy restoration to Judea. They, therefore, have no wish to amalgamate with the citizens of any other country, and they continue in many respects as distinct a people, though living in the heart of the metropolis, as their fore- fathers did in the days of Moses and the prophets, when dwelling in the midst of the Gentile nations.74 At the very moment that the reformers were planning to open their doors, James Grant was writing that the Jews were still indifferent toward 70.

The response of the reformers to this impression, apparently still popular in the early 1840s and obviously widespread in the early 1 830s, as revealed in Goldsmid's pam- phlets, was that Jews are native and loyal Englishmen-they are "British Jews." The inference must be made that this self-identification resulted from the desire to affirm that British Jews were indeed concerned with their status in political life.76 However, not the name of the new congregation alone, but the very reforms introduced by the West London Synagogue, reflected the emanci- pation ambitions of the founding members. The Jewish Chronicle, in de- scribing the meeting in March 1845 between Prime Minister Peel and the delegation headed by the Goldsmids, reports as follows: We believe that the object of this deputation was not to importune the minister to extend the benefits of the present measure, but to place before him certain facts connected with the advancement of British Jews in the several branches of letters and science, in the different learned professions, as well as in the improvement of the worship of the synagogue, during the last few years; and thus to induce him to originate, or to support in the next Session of Parlia- ment, a bill for full and complete emancipation."77 If this account is correct, then when the reformers came forth in 1845 as a rival lobby to the Board of Deputies, they incorporated into their case the changes they had introduced in Jewish religious practice. But what strategic role could these reforms have played in the diplomacy of the Burton Street delegation? Three of the changes introduced by the reformers were intended to increase decorum during the services. Grant's chapter on the Jews of London provides us with a description of Jewish services as viewed by a non-Jew. 75. Grant noted that the presses were literally brought to a halt to include a note on the secession. See ibid., pp. 310-12. 76. Barnett's assertion that this designation of "British" does not signify "non- foreign," but rather "the unification of 'Sephardi' and 'Ashkenazi' in a single term," does not seem to consider the explanation of the name given by the Sephardi seceders, quoted above, p. 134. They refer to the fact that many so-called Portu- guese and German Jews are, in fact, "natives and, in many instances, descendants of natives of the British empire." Barnett, op. cit., p. 179. 77.

My surprise, then, will be easily conceived when in going into them, and that too on some of their most solemn occasions, I saw the congregation smiling, laughing, joking with each other, and carrying on conversation to- gether, as if they had been in the market place. What made their irreverent conduct appear still more out of place, was the circum- stance of each Jew having his prayer book in his hand all the while. There certainly was nothing in their outward aspect, which seemed in accordance with the demeanour which is naturally expected from those who have met for the solemn worship of the Almighty. It would pain me to entertain an uncharitable thought respecting any body of my fellow-creatures; but the conviction has forced itself upon my mind ... that the Jews look upon the worship of Jehovah as consisting solely in their being present in the synagogue and in repeating certain parts of their form of service. I am afraid that the state of the heart is generally overlooked as an essential prere- quisite to acceptable worship.78 Grant's negative reaction to the lack of decorum during Jewish services did not stand in isolation. Amelia Bristow described Jewish worshippers in her novel Emma de Lissau as follows: [They] united religious superstition and bigotry with the most careless apathy and levity. Completely immersed as they are in traffic and commercial speculations, and quitting business only to relax their minds, they enter on all the fashionable amusements of the day; the theater, the ball-room, the card table-nay even the prize ring. They perform their cold and heartless synagogue worship, their daily use of the phylacteries and shemonahessrah, or prayer of the eighteen blessings. Their easy access to English society has greatly assisted to destroy their ancient character.7" Is it possible that the reformers had internalized values of decorum and therefore included these changes in their program? Reforms were sought by more individuals than identified with the secession. In fact, the move- ment for changes within the established synagogues continued even after the secession occurred. The question is not whether the seceders had internalized certain aesthetic values. The question is what distinguished the seceders from the "reformers from within." 78.

Amelia Bristow, Emma de Lissau, quoted in Montague Frank Modder, The Jew in the Literature of England (New York, 1960), p. 152.</page><page sequence="21">ROBERT LIBERLES 141 It would be shallow to argue that Jews had to increase the decorum and spiritual content of their services in order to combat this dim view of the spiritual level of Jewish worship and to prove themselves worthy of emancipation. But the reformers did make decorum a matter of highest priority, and it seems plausible that they did so as a response to the critical views of the British public. We have already noted that the introduction of preaching appears to have stemmed from the same desire to increase the spiritual tone of the service. Thus, it could be suggested that preaching was introduced to satisfy the same critical views we have already quoted. It might be added that Grant, while noting that sermons are not given often, referred rather positively to the occasional preaching that did occur in the synagogues. He also quoted at great length a sermon of Reverend D. Meldola of Bevis Marks.80 The fifth reform instituted by the West London Synagogue was the abolishment of the observance of the Second Day of the Festivals. It was this reform, probably more than any other, that introduced a marked change in religious practice. The reformers justified this move in their letter to the Elders, stating: It is not the intention of the body of which we form part to recognize as sacred days those which are evidently not ordained as such in Scripture; and they consequently appointed the service for holy convocations to be read on those days only thus designated.8' This reform-by far the most radical change introduced-prompted the later debate over the authority of the Oral Law.82 What is perhaps strangest of all is that the British reformers, despite the moderation in all other areas, actually preceded the German reformers in abolishing the Second Day. The question of the Second Day arose in Germany at the Frankfurt conference in 1845, and at that time no definitive statement was possible. While the conference declared that these holidays no longer had any religious significance, nevertheless, members of the various con- gregations continued to look upon them as holy days. It was concluded that elimination of the Second Days was justified, but that if members requested services on those days, they should be so provided.83 The 80. Grant, op. cit., pp. 294-96. 81.

Philipson, op. cit., pp. 214-15.</page><page sequence="22">142 REFORM MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND peculiarity of the British position is even more complicated by the fact that when German and American reformers did discuss eliminating the Second Day, they did so because of their disclaimer of an eventual Jewish return to Palestine "4a disclaimer not shared by the British reformers, who had affirmed their belief in traditional messianism. It is possible that the political approach which we have been using to study British reform may shed light on this difficult problem.85 Throughout this study, we have referred to the Jewish struggle for emancipation in the 1830s and 1840s. What precisely were Jews struggling for? Jews were no longer restricted by numerous prohibitions that had plagued them in the past. They could settle where they please .... There was no legal bar to their employing non-Jewish labour . .. to dealing in any commodity, to engaging in any business occupation or in any branch of manu- facture .... In practice they were even allowed to vote in parliamen- tary elections .. .86 What they still lacked was the right to serve as public officials. Jews were excluded from any office under the Crown, any part in civic government, or any employment however modest in connexion with the administration of justice or even education, by the Test and Corporation Acts .. ..7 Once Jews refused to take the Sacramental oaths required by these laws, they were excluded from public office and various professions. The leaders of the reform movement must be seen as major proponents of opening the doors of British public life to the Jews. With the goals of the reformers more precisely defined, the following comment of James Grant may be suggestive: The Jew spends immeasurably more of his time and money on his religion, than we Christians do on ours. His liberality in money is perhaps twice as great; while instead of our fifty-two days in the year, his religion taking his Sabbaths and ours altogether, and adding to them twenty-one days for his fasts and festivals, occupies at least 125 out of the 365 days of the year.88 84. Ibid., pp. 214, 334. 85. The following solution to the problem of the abolition of the "Second Days" was suggested to me by my teacher, Dr. Ismar Schorsch. 86.

Grant, op. cit., p. 306.</page><page sequence="23">ROBERT LIBERLES 143 Grant was not merely totaling the days of Jewish religious observance, for if he were, he would not have included the Christian Sabbath days. It would seem, therefore, that underlying Grant's calculations is an observa- tion that Jews must absent themselves from their occupational activities for one-third of every year. In this light it makes perfect sense to include in the list those Christian holidays on which Jews also cannot work. It is being suggested that to counteract such a perception of the Jews, the proponents of emancipation called for elimination of six holy days from the Jewish calendar. This suggestion should not be dismissed be- cause eliminating six out of 125 days would be an irrational act. In addi- tion to the Sabbath, there are thirteen days during the year on which work is prohibited for Jews. Abolishing this restriction for six of these thirteen could have been seen as a significant attempt to facilitate Jewish entry into governmental life.89 Furthermore, these were not just any six days, and Petuchowski may have suggested to us why they were most vulnerable. It is certainly plausible that the political objectives of the reformers merged with the anti-Rabbinism of some Christians resulting in the abolition of the Second Days.9o We have, to this point, suggested that the adoption of the title of "British Jews," as well as the five reforms introduced by the synagogue, can be understood as responses to public opinion by those who were most committed to the Jewish emancipation struggle. These religious changes were not arbitrarily selected. Rather, they were introduced by the reformers as a significant factor in the emancipation strategy of the segment of British Jewry that believed the established community was moving too feebly in the struggle for equality. 89. The work prohibition applies to the three days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the two days of Shavuot, and to the first two and last two days of Sukkot and Pesach. The twenty-one days referred to by Grant include the eight intermediate days of the Festivals, on which the reformers would certainly have worked. With regard to the specific aspiration of the Jew to be entitled to admission to Parliament, it should be noted that Parliament did not meet on either Saturday or Sunday at that time. Therefore only the thirteen festival days would require the absence of the observant Jew, and the abolition of the Second Days would have reduced this number by one-half. 90.

Dissatisfied with the attempts of the Board of Deputies to attain civil equality for the Jews, these men formed a new synagogue, a synagogue which was intended to serve as a rival institution, not to Bevis Marks or to the Great Synagogue, but rather to the Board of Deputies. For the Goldsmids, the West London Synagogue represented the final step in a policy of dissent from the Board that dated back over a decade of their own attempts in the struggle. With the founding of the synagogue, the Goldsmids, at last, had a power base from which to operate. This paper has attempted to analyze the objectives of the founding members of England's first reform synagogue. In so doing, frequent refer- ence has been made to the accusation by those gentlemen that the Board of Deputies was far too moderate in its pursuit of the complete removal of Jewish disabilities in political life. We have not been engaged in a study of the struggle for Jewish emancipation in England. Brief examinations of this topic already exist and a more extensive work is sorely needed."9 But this study would remain incomplete without examining the interplay between the internal dispute within the Jewish community and the external negotiations with British officials for Jewish rights. Several references have been made to the intensification of efforts on be- half of emancipation during the early months of 1845. The newspaper reports covering the submission of two simultaneous petitions to Prime Minister Peel imply a surprising degree of success for the reformers. Despite the fact that Montefiore headed a delegation representing the established Jewish community and supported by a considerably larger constituency, the Jewish Chronicle reports that "the Premier declined giving any defini- 91.

L. Goldsmid and the gentlemen whom he represented." 93 Two weeks later the Chronicle reported, "We know not the results of this interview, but we hear that the gentlemen forming the deputation [of Sir I. L. Goldsmid] have every reason to be well satisfied." 94 The implication established by the Chronicle that the dissenting delega- tion held great influence on Peel, probably because of the social stature of its members, is incorrect. The papers of Prime Minister Peel reveal that Peel was, with some frequency, visited by delegations to discuss emancipa- tion legislation. While David Salomons and Moses Montefiore had access to the Prime Minister, the most frequent and influential visitor was Baron Lionel de Rothschild. Peel received delegations representing the Board on February 19 and March 4."5 He received Rothschild alone on March 9.96 During this same period Peel was inaccessible to the Goldsmids.97 Nor is there any indication that Peel reserved his final decision concerning Jewish legislation until after seeing the Goldsmid group, as asserted by the Chronicle. On February 22, Peel responded to Goldsmid's memorial, apparently promising a future interview. But on that same date, a few days after meeting with a delegation from the Board, Peel instructed the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, to prepare a bill opening Municipal Offices to the Jews.98 Parliament would, contrary to the desires of the dissidents, remain closed. On March 4 he once again received the Board delegation and on that same date wrote an aloof note to the Goldsmids.99 Only after the bill had been formulated-under Rothschild's influence-did Peel re- ceive the Burton Street delegation. It was by now the middle of March, and even then, the appointment was made for Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.?00 Clearly the major influences from the Jewish community on Peel at this time came from delegations representing the Board of Deputies, and not the reformers. 93.

Its representatives were more agreeable to political compromise, but they were not inactive. Yet we can distinguish between the activity of the two groups. While the re- formers proceeded full-speed, attempting to open new gates for British Jewry, the orthodox camp proceeded only with frequent glances over their shoulders. This attitude was well expressed in an anonymous letter to the Board of Deputies, published in the traditionalist Voice of Jacob. S. although Sir Isaac Goldsmid appears to have provoked some dissatisfaction, by complaining that no more was then asked than eligibility to municipal and corporate office, I for my part am satisfied only because it was no more. Experience has shown, that it is at least possible for a Jew to discharge municipal and corporate offices without violation of his religious duties ... 1xo The opening of political opportunities could not, in the orthodox view, preclude the free right of religious observance. For Montefiore, the tension between the two was even more complicated. Montefiore, for his part, had a communal responsibility shared by no one else-neither from his own, nor from the opposing camp. It was Montefiore who interceded with the government when the free right of Jews to practice their religion was threatened. Examining one instance of this activity will be instructive. In 1843 and again in 1850, Montefiore petitioned the Home Office to safeguard Jewish burial rights against proposed enactments by the Board of Health. On February 3, 1843, Montefiore wrote Sir James Graham: "It is earnestly hoped that in any Bill that may be introduced regard will be had to the peculiar position of the Jews relative to their places of interment." 102 Montefiore wrote in an 1850 statement: ... that the Jewish Community view the new powers conferred by the present Bill as an interference with their religious observances with respect to interment and that such interference would be totally at variance with the existing legislation and usage, which have hitherto secured to the Jews the free enjoyment of their Religion.?03 101.

His agitation on behalf of burial rights was as integral a part of the emancipation struggle as his meetings with Peel over Municipal Offices. The threat to Jewish burial rights provides us with some insight into Montefiore's diplomatic style in protecting the right of British Jews to follow religious observances. Montefiore emphasized that Jews were not lobbying for exemption from public health standards. Rather, argued Montefiore: The Doctrines and peculiar customs of the Jews, are therefore the best safeguards to the public upon all those points which have at- tracted attention more particularly upon the subject of opening graves and interment beneath places of Worship such practices being con- trary to the usages of the Jews.'04 In listing the synagogues of London, Montefiore, needless to say, did not include the West London Synagogue. Uniformity of religious practice and the hierarchy of authority enabled Montefiore to assure the public authori- ties that health standards would be adhered to. He could not have guar- anteed the practices of any congregation which deviated from orthodox law and which challenged the authority of the Rabbinate.'o0 We have in a sense come full circle. If political considerations gave rise to religious dissent in London in the 1840s, religious considerations were probably among the factors that required Montefiore, as head of the Board of Deputies, to oppose recognition of the reformers. Nevertheless, as we have seen, the orthodox camp was, on the whole, quite sympathetic to the ideal of emancipation, while the reformers, as demonstrated by the very moderation of their religious changes, were also concerned with main- taining traditional religious life. Yet the reformers were more impatient to secure political equality. What was the driving force behind this im- patience? The stage of history changes scenery often as we move from religion to politics to social and economic considerations. What, in fact, separated these two groups of men? It was neither wealth, nor education, nor political 104. Argument 7 of statement accompanying letter of February 3, 1843, HO 45/3205. 105.

Were the Goldsmids more politically inclined than Baron Roth- schild, David Salomons, or even Moses Montefiore, former Sheriff of Lon- don? The answer cannot be found by taking a still photograph of Anglo- Jewry, but only by allowing a series of shots to move along the screen. At one time, the Goldsmids and Mocattas dominated the financial life of London and, accordingly, the religious life of their respective Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities. But with the passage of time new personalities arose into these same positions of leadership. One, a nephew of Moses Mocatta, was a scion of a family of Italian origins.'06 He received his early training in the bank owned by the Mocattas and Goldsmids, but at a later date left that bank to cast his lot with a newcomer to London. The relative of the Mocattas was Moses Montefiore and the newcomer was Nathan Rothschild of Frankfurt.'0 With their existing modes of power disappearing, these older families of London Jewry struck out in a new direction. Their long history of resi- dence in England and of service to the Crown had justified, in their view, their claims to full political rights. Their "all or nothing" demands demon- strate their sense of being entitled to these rights. During the parliamentary debates of 1845, they remained aloof, actually declaring their indifference to passage of a compromise measure.x0s They were echoing I. L. Golds- mid's 1831 comment that "he did not care about the measure." Their sense of "being entitled" explains the striking contrast between the far-reaching religious reforms introduced in Germany and the English reforms, which essentially focused on an increase in decorum. Just as these aristocratic families would not consider a half-way measure as being a sufficient acknowledgment of their position, so they would refuse to com- promise their religious practices in order to prove themselves "worthy" of emancipation. They had proved themselves worthy long ago, and all that remained was to tidy up their services to be more indicative of the behavior of British gentlemen. The formation of the West London Synagogue was but one dimension of dissension from the policies of the Board of Deputies during those trying days of the struggle for emancipation. With little exception, writers have tended too often to minimize this dissent or to ignore it altogether.'09 The 106. Lucien Wolf, Sir Moses Montefiore (London, 1884), p. 5. 107.

One of the early concerns of the reformers was to provide burial arrange- ments for their members. In June 1841, a few months before a formal declaration of censure was issued by the Rabbinate, the Maiden Lane Synagogue entered into negotiations to open its burial grounds to members of the West London Synagogue."0 That privilege was used only once be- fore the new congregation secured its own cemetery, but the single in- stance is of importance. When Mrs. Horatio Montefiore, sister-in-law of Sir Moses and wife of one of the founding members of the West London Synagogue, passed away, burial rights were refused by Bevis Marks. Mrs. Montefiore was buried on the premises of the Maiden Lane Synagogue."' In supporting the reformers, Maiden Lane was opposing the policies of the "established" Jewish institutions. When we recall, in addition, that the Maiden Lane Synagogue had re- signed its membership from the Board in 1839, that at the beginning of 1840 it had submitted a separate note of congratulations to Queen Victoria, and finally, that it had employed the good offices of I. L. Goldsmid to deliver that note,"2 we can conclude that the Maiden Lane Synagogue likewise objected to the centralization of political authority in the hands of the Board, though it would go beyond this evidence to assume that the motivations were identical with those of the founding members of the West London Synagogue. Which side in this controversy contributed the most to the emancipation effort? The pressures exerted by the West London Synagogue and others forced the Board to increase its emancipation activities. David Salomons, perhaps, summed it up best in a letter of February 9, 1845, to Robert Peel: Sir, At the interview which you so kindly honored me some time ago, you were pleased to intimate that about this period a communication from yourself should inform me of the views and intuitions of the Government. Believe me, Sir, that I have been looking forward with unceasing interest and with fervent hope to the present moment, when I expected to be honored with your commands. Having stated 110.

We have thus re- strained public action for a time and become open to the charge of infirmity altogether at variance with our real sentiments. But we are no longer able to resist the pressure for a more active demon- stration to be made on our behalf .. 113 The emancipation struggle in Europe was a trying chapter in Jewish history that produced tensions not only between Jews and non-Jews, but within the Jewish community as well. Our precursors in Jewish scholarship taught us to look outwards to understand the forces of Jewish history. Yet we must not overlook the dynamics of Jewish communal life and the effects of these internal forces in precipitating various forms of movement activity and intellectual creativity. The rise of the Jewish reform move- ment in England took place within the framework of the political entry of the Jew into British society. It was precipitated by the tensions we have described between two factions of the Jewish community of London. 113. Peel Papers, CCCLXXIX, 233-34.</page></plain_text>
