<plain_text><page sequence="1">Teshome G. Wagaw. For Our Soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. 1993. xi, 293 pp. Like many Jews who have moved to Israel, Ethiopian Jews were motivated by both push and pull factors. The economic and political situation in Ethiopia, combined with the allure of Zion (and political activity on the part of Israel to facilitate their exit), led to a much-publicized migratory movement that brought over 15,000 Jews to Israel in the 1980s. Teshome G. Wagaw, who left Ethiopia in 1974 and settled in the United States, visited Israel during the 1986-87 academic year to study the Ethiopian community there. The result of Wagaw's participant observation, and his interviews with Ethiopian migrants and a host of officials, teachers, psychologists, politicians, food supervisors, rabbis, and many others who had contacts and dealings with the Beta Israel, is a comprehensive study from which we can learn much not only about Ethiopian Jews but also about Israeli society. The Beta Israel (commonly called the Falasha) claim to have led a life as authentic Jews, in accordance with the principles of the Orit (Old Testament) and their own religious works which evolved over the centuries, for some 2,700 years. They came to Israel as Jews, but like immigrants from other countries before and after them, found that they were seen and identified more as members of their countries of origin than as Israelis. In their particular case, their very identity as Jews was challenged by the rabbinate. The issue of who is a Jew produced much tension in the Ethiopian community and led to strikes and protests. It was an unfortunately realistic introduction for them to what life in Israel is like. The struggle that ensued helped to undermine their sense of identity, anyway made fragile by the difficult migration movement, which had seen families split apart and thousands die along the way. The</page><page sequence="2">482 BOOK REVIEWS crisis of identity was exacerbated by the Israeli practice of almost arbitrarily assigning new names to the Ethiopian Jews. Wagaw provides a historical background of life in Ethiopia and the place of the Jews in that country. The chapter on "Israel as an Absorbing State" is worth reading even if one is interested only in the story of migration and settlement in Israel without specific reference to Ethiopians. The melting pot theory that characterizes Israel's orientation toward migrants, as it seeks to mold them into new Israelis, was bound to be even more problematic for Ethiopians than for other migrants because the Western aspects of Israeli life were almost totally alien to most of them. The disparity between Ethiopian and Israeli culture has had a devastating effect on family life. The authority of the male head has been undermined, and there are many single-parent families, most of them headed by females. The kes, or traditional religious leader, does not provide the same degree of spiritual and emotional support as he did in the past. Moreover, real friendships between veteran Israelis and Ethiopians are almost nonexistent. The relatively small size of the Ethiopian group and their lack of advanced occupational skills (as contrasted with the later mass migration from the former Soviet Union) do not threaten many groups in Israel. The Ethiopians can therefore be regarded as a curiosity, be the subject of assistance campaigns, and then be forgotten. But the problems they face are very real. Wagaw analyzes these problems as he studies the difficulties the Ethiopians encounter in absorption centers and in the educational system. He is critical of the lack of sensitivity on the part of the Israeli absorbers, who could have organized and better prepared for this not-unexpected migration movement. The book presupposes no prior knowledge of Israel. Perhaps this is because Wagaw is neither an Israeli nor a Jew, and therefore views the situation as an outsider and is sensitive to the need for contextual explanations. This results in the presentation of much background material about Israeli society that may be familiar to some readers. We learn about the educational system and the Youth Aliyah program before learning about the specific problems faced by the Ethiopians. The separate analyses of various schools and institutions that have accommodated Ethiopian youth is disconcerting for those used to more quantitative or summary descriptions. The depiction of Israeli life is generally quite accurate, but there are some breaches. Writing that males predominate in a yeshiva implies that girls also study there. The division of Israeli Jews into 30 percent religious and 70 percent secular makes it seem</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 483 that religious life is more polarized than it is in reality. There are occasional mistakes in the Hebrew terms cited, but in the overall framework of the book these lapses are truly minor. Wagaw notes that the story of Ethiopian immigrants in Israel is a story of misperceptions and lack of understanding. The cultural rift is substantial and mutual. Israelis and Ethiopians do not understand each other's expec- tations. The Ethiopians apparently expect more long-term assistance than the government intends (or can afford) to give them. Add to this the fact that the "Israelis" are actually organizations with their own agendas, and individuals with their own cultural stereotypes and prejudices, and we have a volatile situation. Wagaw also talks about possible racism against Ethiopians in Israel. There are no hard data about this. I wonder whether Wagaw has been sensitized to the issue by virtue of his years in the United States. I suspect that there might be some racism in Israel, although I think that the comparison made in the book between Yemenites and Ethiopians confuses ethnicity with racism. The volume includes an epilogue written in 1992 to try and bring the situation up to date. The book's thoroughness up to that point makes the epilogue seem thin. We need a scholar like Wagaw, who can speak with the Ethiopians in their native languages, and who shows as much sensitivity in understanding the nature and workings of Israeli society, to follow up this study. Wagaw anticipates the children in this study serving in the army. The army indeed has inducted Ethiopian migrants and (at least for a while) conducted special programs for them. We need to know more about how the Ethiopian community has since developed. We need to know how earlier immigrants from Ethiopia affected the absorption of those who came in the 1990s. We also need to view such a study from a comparative perspective. The mass inflow of Russians in recent years has led to tension between them and the Ethiopians, and to different attitudes on the part of the native Israeli populace toward both groups. Wagaw's perceptive study serves as an excellent basis for understanding the past, and as a valuable framework for further research in the migration and absorption process.
