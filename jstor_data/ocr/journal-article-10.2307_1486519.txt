<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE: MARTYRDOM AND ITS RECOMPENSE by SHMUEL SHEPKARU In rabbinical literature the belief in a postmortem existence is rather obvious. Related terminology is relatively abundant, although fluid and obscure at times. The use of this terminology by a diversity of Jewish sources further complicates the understanding of the enigmatic notion called afterlife.' The purpose of this article is to explore one aspect of the Jewish credo of the afterlife: the nature of divine recompense in relation to martyrdom.2 The article aims at determining when a relationship between voluntary death and divine recompense was first established and what the nature of this recompense was. While this relationship does not contain answers to every question regarding Jewish tenets on the afterlife, I believe it to be indicative of general Jewish attitudes toward life and death in various periods and Jewries. The article's methodological approach, however, should be made clear from the outset. Rather than reconstructing actual historical events, the article aims at tracing the theoretical and theological evolution of the relationship 1. S. P. Raphael traces the history of the notion of afterlife in his Jewish Views of the Afterlife (London, 1994). His analysis relies heavily on biblical, apocryphal and pseudepigraphic, rabbinic, midrashic philosophical, kabbalistic, and Hasidic literature. His book, however, does not include many of the sources analyzed below, of which some show attempts at historical writing. E. E. Urbach addressed the issue of reward and punishment in The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs (Jerusalem, 1979), pp. 436-448, and on suffering, pp. 444-448. 2. By martyrdom I refer to forms of voluntary death that are exercised in a religious context, a phenomenon usually described in rabbinic Judaism as "the sanctification of the Divine Name" (qiddush ha-Shem). The martyr, therefore, is one who consciously chooses death over life for religious reasons. On rabbinic definition and usage of the term, see E. Grunewald, "Qiddush ha-Shem: An Examination of a Term" (Hebrew), Molad 24 (1968): 476-484, and S. Safrai, "Qiddush ha-Shem in the Teachings of the Tannaim" (Hebrew), Zion 43 (1979): 28-42.

By and large, it treats speeches that authors attributed to their martyrological heroes even though there is no way of knowing how accurate and genuine these speeches are, for the authors were not always present or committed to carefully recording the martyrs' exact words. This fact alone may suggest that the martyrs' declarations, although not necessarily the events themselves, are often the product of the authors' creativity.3 With this caveat in mind, we turn to the two depictions of Jews passively giving up their lives rather than transgress God's laws that are found in the books of the Maccabees. Second Maccabees, a first-century B.C.E. epitome of a five-volume account by Jason of Cyrene, relates the story of the elderly Eleazar, who chose death rather than submit to King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Eleazar served Antiochus as the perfect target, for he was "one of the foremost scribes, a man well advanced in years and of most noble countenance." Of interest here is how the author describes Eleazar's motivation for dying. The martyrological motif is clear. In the author's opinion, Eleazar "welcomed death with glory rather than life with pollution, and of his free will went to the rack." He makes Eleazar "an example of what men should do who are steadfast enough to forfeit life itself rather than eat what is not right ... in spite of the natural urge to live."4 The final explanation for embracing death over life is left to Eleazar: Even if for the present I were to escape the punishment of men, nevertheless I could not escape, either living or dead, the vengeance of the Almighty. Therefore, by departing this life courageously now, I shall have left a noble example of how to die happily and nobly in behalf of our revered and holy laws. ... The Lord in His sacred knowledge is aware that though I could escape death I now endure terrible suffering in my body under this flogging; yet with my soul I suffer this gladly, because of my reverence for Him.' 3. Although this fundamental caveat should always be observed when dealing with mar- tyrological accounts, each account deserves an individual treatment. The sources describing events during the Crusades, for example, reflect genuine attempts at writing historical reports, although recording history was not consistently their only objective. See discussion and relevant scholarly works below. 4. 2 Maccabees 6:18-30. The translation is from the Dropsie College edition of Jewish Apocryphal Literature, ed. S. Zeitlin, trans. S.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="3">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 3 Eleazar makes his difficult decision calmly, for transgression will bring upon him the unescapable vengeance of the Almighty. Eleazar's choice contains two positive features: the opportunity to express his ultimate loyalty to God, and a noble method of avoiding an unbearable life of divine punishment. In his account of the martyrdom of an anonymous mother and her seven sons, the author advances an even more daring concept.6 Despite the dismembering and frying of their organs in pans and cauldrons, the martyrs pronounce their conviction of their physical resurrection after death. In contrast to the ephemeral physical torture by the human king, the heavenly King will grant them an eternal reward here and now-corporeal resurrection in this world. Resurrection emerges as a recurrent motif in this account. After the execution of the first son, the second son reassures the king that he may terminate their "present existence, but the King of the Universe will raise us up to everlasting life because we have died for His laws." Coinciding is the third son's proclamation: "from heaven have I had these [limbs], yet because of God's laws I count them as nothing, for from Him I hope to have them back again." Thus, he believes, "better is it for people to be done to death by men if they have the hopeful expectation that they will again be raised up by God." The author has the seventh son summarize the essence of the struggle and the sons' conviction. After enduring brief trouble they will be "under God's covenant for everlasting life." The mother, who was not forced to transgress, does not lose faith either when watching the gory executions of her children. She expects God to "give life back" to them so that she can receive them back again.7 Passive voluntary death in the name of God and the reward of resurrection constitute two innovative concepts that 2 Maccabees introduces with the two 6.

Representations of the resurrection of the dead appear in several places in the Bible. Ezekiel's vision of the awakened dry bones in the valley (37:1-13) provides a well-known illustration. Other passages appear in Isaiah 26:19 and the apocalyptic vision of Daniel 12:1-2. See also H. Birkeland, "The Belief in the Resurrection of the Dead in the Old Testament," Studia Theologica 3 (1950): 60-78. The difference between the biblical depiction and 2 Maccabees lies in the fact that the Bible recounts prophecies, while 2 Maccabees describes "actual events." Moreover, the prophecies refer to the nation of Israel and its collective fate, not to individuals and certainly not to individual martyrs. Daniel's description of a final judgment, punishment, and reward is somewhat closer in nature to that of 2 Maccabees, which is not surprising given the fact that Daniel's last six chapters were written sometime around the date of the Hasmonean revolt. To these biblical depictions we may add the story of Elisha, who brings a boy back to life (2 Kings 4:32-35, 1 Kings 17:17-22). Elisha's revival of the boy, however, describes a miracle rather than a reward. For a possible Zoroastrian influence on the concept of bodily resurrection in Ezekiel, see B. Lang, "Street Theater, Raising the Dead, and the Zoroastrian Connection in Ezekiel's Prophecy," in Ezekiel and His Book, ed. J. Lust (Leuven University Press, 1986), pp. 297-316; C. McDannell and B.

He writes: "So if the two stories in the books of the Maccabees have nothing to do either with the authentic history of the Maccabees or with the lost original text that recounted it, it may be suggested that they have everything to do with the aspirations and literature of the early Christians." In other words, he sees the stories as the product of a first-century "or slightly later" Palestinian copier or translator. Martyrdom and Rome (Cambridge, 1995), pp. 12-13. Although Bowersock's suggestion would support the article's theses, I did not find enough evidence to accept his theory.</page><page sequence="5">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 5 separated God and the living from the realm of the dead.12 Accordingly, any significant existence ends with death, because, as Psalm 115:17 conveys, to mention one example, "the dead do not praise Yah." Those who cannot praise Him thus cannot benefit from Him. Both the validity of this taboo and the attempt by 2 Maccabees to do away with it find expression also in the depiction of Judah Maccabee's treatment of his fallen comrades. The author finds it necessary to explain why Judah offered penance on behalf of his slain soldiers, who had carried "amulets sacred to idols." For if he had not been expecting the fallen to rise again it would have been foolish and superfluous to pray for the dead. But since he had in view the wonderful reward for those who die a godly death, his purpose was a holy and pious one. And this was why he offered an atoning sacrifice to free the dead from their sin.'3 This explanation would have been superfluous if the conviction in physical resurrection or a "wonderful reward" had constituted an integral part of first- century Jewish theology. The absence of this conviction in First Maccabees further substantiates the notion of the futility of life after death, which appears to be especially true in relation to voluntary death. According to First Maccabees, one thousand Jews escaped with their families and belongings to the wilderness to avoid Hellenization.'4 When 12. The theology that followed King Josiah's reforms maintained no promise for the dead regardless of circumstances. See, for example, Job 14:12, 26:5-6, 42:10; and especially Isaiah 26:14, "They are dead, they can never live. Rephaim [i.e., the dead] they can never rise," or Ecclesiastes 9:5, "The living know they will die, but the dead know nothing, nor they have any more a reward, for the memory of them is forgotten."

Since the attack occurred on the Sabbath, the refugees did not defend themselves. According to the narrative, they did not expect any future phase to succeed their death. They contented themselves with the knowledge that all of them died in "innocence." Their hope that "heaven and earth [might] testify" on their behalf that they were destroyed "against all justice" suggests that these martyrs expected their ultimate act of loyalty to terminate their existence, leaving for posterity only the memory of their innocent lives.5 To be sure, the story is more complicated than it appears, but suffice it here to emphasize the existence of martyrological behavior and the absence of reward in the account.'6 As in Eleazar's story, the author ascribes to the refugees' act only the benefit of preventing transgression. Divine retribution rather than reward is said to propel these actors toward their final deed."7 This attitude toward voluntary death and the absence of supernatural merit continued to dominate Jewish society after it came under Roman dominion.'8 The conflicts between the new rulers and their pacifist Jewish subjects 15. 1 Maccabees 2:29-38. 16.

This action, according to Josephus Flavius, triggered unrest and numerous Jewish petitions on account of the prohibition against installing icons in the city. Pilate expected the demonstrations to end violently, but the protestors instead, "casting themselves prostrate and baring their throats declared that they had gladly welcome death rather than make bold to transgress the wise provisions of the laws."20 Similar declarations were made during another conflict with Rome (40-41 C.E.), triggered by Apion's imputations of Jewish treachery. To test Jewish loyalty and assert his authority, the emperor Gaius Caligula dispatched his general Petronius with clear instructions "to set up an image of Gaius in the Temple of God and if, however, they [the Jews] were obstinate, he was to subdue them by force of arms and so set it up."21 Fortunately for the Jewish participants, the incident ended peacefully and without casualties. But the elaborate proclamations Josephus attributes to them demonstrate their readiness to be killed rather than violate God's laws. What is noticeably absence in these proclamations is the expectation of reward after death. As the "many ten thousand of Jews" proclaimed: If you [Petronius] propose at all costs to bring in and set up the images, slay us first before you carry out these resolutions. For it is not possible for us to survive and to behold actions that are forbidden us by the decision both of our lawgiver and of our forefathers. .... In order to preserve our ancestral code, we shall patiently endure what may be in store for us. In Tiberias, Jews expressed parallel motives for choosing death in preference to accepting Petronius' plan. Fighting the Roman was not an option for these Jews, but they were willing to "die sooner than violate" their religious laws. 19. In accordance with my definition of martyrdom, I am referring here only to conflicts with Jews who were ready to be killed rather than let the Romans change the religious status quo in Jerusalem, but refused to take up arms. As is well known, the conflicts with the militant Jewish factions ended in bloodshed. 20. Josephus Flavius, Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, iii, 1. The following translations of Josephus' works are from the Loeb Classical Library. 21. Josephus, Ant. XVIII, viii, 2.</page><page sequence="8">8 SHMUEL SHEPKARU "For they showed a stubborn determination and readiness to die rather than to see the image erected."22 Voluntary death serves in these cases only as a means of circumventing a transgression. What emerges from the potential martyrs' proclamation is that the boon of life surpasses the void of death. Thus they challenged death "with the assurance that for those who are determined to take the risk there is hope even of prevailing; for God will stand by us if we welcome danger for His glory."23 The true purpose of altruism was thus the annulment of religious oppression and the preservation of Jewish life in the long run. Philo of Alexandria also provides a description of the conflict with Petronius, one of several accounts that reveals not only the potential martyrs' views on voluntary death, but also his own. His accounts are especially valuable to us because of their philosophical and religious aspects. In addition to statements about passive voluntary death, self-annihilation, and intentional self-sacrifice of fellow Jews, his report of the conflict with Petronius contains explicit evaluations of life and death. According to Philo, Jews were willing to die and kill themselves rather than violate the Law even though they believed that death would be the end of their existence. "But if we cannot persuade you [Petronius]," he purportedly quotes those ready to die as saying, "we give up ourselves for destruction that we may not live to see a calamity worse than death [emphasis added]." Tom between "fear of the emperor and loyalty to the consecrated laws," their voluntary deaths serve as the only way of "departure in contempt of the life which is no life."24 This nihilistic approach toward death was also Philo's personal opinion. Before departing for Rome to persuade Caligula to nullify his decree, Philo was well aware that the mission might cost him his life. Still, he writes, And even if we were allowed to approach him [Caligula] unmolested, what have we to expect but death against which there is no appeal? Well, so be it, we will die and be no more [emphasis added], for the truly glorious death, met in defense of the laws, might be called life.25 22. Ibid., 2-3. 23. Ibid., 2. 24.

Philo's fatalistic view resurfaces in his On Joseph 68. "I will fear none of the tyrant's menaces, even though he threaten me with death, for death is a lesser evil than dissimulation."</page><page sequence="9">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 9 In this circumstance, Philo views death as a better option than "life which is no life," even though he believes that nothing meaningful lies beyond the threshold of death.26 For Philo, life without the Torah is death, while the Torah represents the only true and eternal life.27 Philo's view on the function of voluntary death, then, concurs with that found in Josephus' reports on the peaceful protests in Ptolemais and Tiberias. At first glance, however, Josephus appears to depart from this "down- to-earth" view in his account of Eleazar, the leader of the Jewish rebels who killed themselves and their families at Masada. In quoting Eleazar's speech, Josephus introduces the concept of the immortal soul as a possible reward for voluntary death. But more than substantiating a Jewish trust in a postmortem existence, the speech echoes a debate over the validity of the concept of immortality and the more general dilemma as to whether voluntary self-termination of life is legitimate and morally acceptable. There is no need to repeat here Josephus' lengthy account of the 960 suicides at Masada. Suffice it to emphasize that in Josephus' account the rebels first reject Eleazar's call to self-destruct. As a result, Eleazar eventually delivers a long philosophical speech on the issue of the immortal soul to convince his audience to accept self-killing in order to liberate their souls from their bodies. Eleazar's speech reflects the difficulties Jews faced in absorbing (1) the innovative notion of immortality, and (2) the acceptance of these ideas in relation to self-killing. What finally persuaded the besieged at Masada to accept death, according to Josephus, was not the notion of reward after death. In his account the motivation for their act was the rebels' love of freedom and, mainly, their fatalistic view that it was by "God's will and of necessity that we are to die." Josephus asserts that they held that "man's highest blessing is life and that death is a calamity."28 Similarly, Josephus' soldiers, who preferred to kill 26. See also his interpretation of Paradise and the Tree of Life. "Of Paradise," he writes, "so far as the literal meaning is concerned, there is no need to give an explicit interpretation... .

From his narration of Mattathias' speech to his sons, it is clear that immortality does not indicate a postmortem condition. In his opinion, only the fame of deeds and heroism are immortal. "For though our bodies are mortal and subject to death, we can through the memory of our deeds, attain the heights of immortality." Ant. XII, vi, 3. On Masada and relevant bibliography, see L. H.

In their eyes, it was "honorable to die in war" and even to kill themselves for liberty. But, according to Josephus, they did not mention other benefits beyond their altruism.29 As is well known, Josephus' descriptions cannot always be taken at face value. Josephus is often tendentious, writing mainly for his Greek readers in Rome. He, therefore, may be suspected of deliberately sprinkling his depiction with Greek philosophy and utilizing notions and images that were intelligible to the Romans, but relatively novel to his co-religionists.30 Nevertheless, his account of Masada reflects more than his subjective views. Josephus' account of Masada echoes a genuine ongoing Jewish debate on the dilemma of the after-death. It is important to recapitulate here the arguments of this debate, for these views will come into play later on. The Sadducees, Pharisees, and Essenes represented three different voices in this debate.3' The concepts of immortality and resurrection, in addition to the innovative phrase "the world to come" (or literally "the next world," olam ha-ba), were major elements in the dissensions between these sects, and still remained a controversial matter in fourth-century rabbinic Judaism.32 pp. 218-248. Interestingly, the Jewish Kantian philosopher Hermann Cohen held a similar view. In his opinion, it is not the individual that is immortal, but only his heritage as it influences human history. A. Arkush, "Immortality," in Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, ed. A. A. Cohen and P. Mendes-Flohr (New York, 1987), pp. 479-482. 29. War II, viii, 5. Josephus' soldiers, who threaten to kill him if he does not agree to kill himself with them, do not mention supernatural rewards as an incentive for dying. Instead they offered him only a noble place in the history of his people. "If you [Josephus] meet death willingly, you will have died as general of the Jews, if unwillingly, as a traitor." War II, viii, 4. 30. On suicide as a virtuous ideal in Roman literature, see Cicero's account of Cato of Utica in Tusculan Disputations 1:71-75 or Seneca, On Providence 2:9-12 and Epistle 12:10, to mention only a few examples. Ant. XIV, iv, 3 is one illustration that Josephus had his Roman historian counterparts in mind when writing. 31. On the sects, see L. Finkelstein, The Pharisees (Philadelphia, 1940), esp. vol. 2, pp. 110-112, 145-159, 178; A. Guttmann, Rabbinic Judaism in the Making (Detroit, 1970), pp. 124-141; J.

I will return to the rabbinic period below.</page><page sequence="11">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 11 About "the persistence of the soul after the death, penalties in the underworld, and rewards," the Sadducees argued, the dead "will have none of them."33 According to Josephus, they believed that the "soul perishes with the body" and the two elements wither together.34 The Pharisaic formulation of the resurrection concept is not completely clear either.35 As Josephus relays, they believed that "the soul of the good alone passes into another body," which, according to Paul, shows that the Pharisees held the hope of resurrection.36 Josephus, a Pharisee himself, expressed similar personal opinions in his speech against mass suicide at Jotapata. "Know you not that they who depart this life in accordance with the law of nature," he asks his comrades, "in the revolution of the ages, they return to find in chaste bodies a new habitation?"37 This is in contrast to those who kill themselves. The phrase "the world to come," which the Pharisees and their rabbinic successors used extensively later on, appears to represent, in its early stages, a new order in the terrestrial realm that would be attained by the believer. In contrast, the evildoer would be destroyed.38 Then the human and mortal Messiah would restore Judean independence and annul Roman power, leading the people of Israel to a new utopian age of 33.

In Against Apion he writes that those who live in accordance with the laws, including those who have died for them, "God has granted [them] a renewed existence and in the revolution of the ages the gift of a better life." This, however, is not to say that those who died for the laws did so in order to be rewarded. As he indicates, the motivation of the "many of our countrymen" was only their preference "to brave all manner of suffering rather than to utter a single word against the Law." Against Apion II, 29. Also, in ibid. I, 8:42-43, and II, 32, the willingness to suffer death is explained in relation to the fear of transgressing the Law. In these descriptions, too, reward is absent. In Ant. XVIII, i, 3, Josephus says that, according to the Pharisees, all souls survive death, regardless of the way it was achieved, and that the righteous and the evil receive their "rewards and punishments under the earth." 38.

Different is the view of the Essenes. Once again the information comes to us from Josephus, who had spent some of his early life with the Essenes.40 The Essenes distinguished between the corruptible body and the immortal and imperishable soul. They believed that with the physical death of the body, the virtuous soul escaped the "prison-house" and, rejoicing, rose upward to its "abode beyond the ocean." On the other hand, the wicked soul descended to Hades to be punished. Resurrection is missing in the Essene descriptions, as well as a clear description of the "abode beyond the ocean."41 In a passage reminiscent of the Maccabean story of the mother and her seven sons (2 Macc. 7), Josephus says that the Romans F.

As Schiffman points out, a clear ideological combination of the restorative and utopian trends is evident for the first time in the Qumran documents, which set the foundations for the Jewish messianic ideology, with its special dialectic characteristics.

Philo does not discuss the Essene eschatology in his description. The three sectarian views come into play in Jesus' dispute with the Sadducees. They posed the dilemma of a remarried widow who, in accordance with Jewish Law, had to marry her husband's six brothers after each one's death. Jesus' solution of the Sadducees' dilemma clearly indicated that he approached resurrection differently. Accordingly, the resurrection of the dead would be more than the simple resurrection that the Pharisees had suggested. Those "worthy of resurrection from the dead ... become like angels and are no longer liable of death. Children of the resurrection, they are children of God." Luke 20, Matt. 22:23-33, Mark 12:18-27. In other words, their resurrection is not in this corporeal world. By this answer, Jesus avoided the dilemma the Pharisees would face when trying to solve the Sadducees' question about the widow, which was based on the Pharisaic belief in a future resurrection in the physical world. Josephus' report of the widow Glaphyra in War II, vii, 4, is reminiscent of the above-mentioned gospels.</page><page sequence="13">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 13 tried their [i.e., the Essenes'] souls through and through by every variety of test. Racked and twisted, burnt and broken, and made to pass through every instrument of torture, in order to induce them to blaspheme their lawgiver or to eat some forbidden thing, they refused to yield to either demand, nor ever once did they crying to their persecutors or shed a tear. Smiling in their agonies and mildly deriding their tormentors, they cheerfully resigned their souls, confident that they would receive them back again. In contrast to the Maccabean sons, who had hoped to receive their bodies again, this dubious report emphasizes, the Essenes only expected to receive their souls back.42 The question that presents itself is, What effect, if any, did the three views that Josephus attributed to the sects have on future martyrdoms? A first-century Palestinian work, the Assumption of Moses,43 describes, in style and content reminiscent of 2 Maccabees' martyrology, how a man named Taxo and his seven sons were ready to withdraw from society and starve to death in a cave in order to bring an end to religious oppression.44 In this story, which does not reveal the fate of the family, the motive for self-starvation excludes any type of reward. To be sure, the disassociation of reward from self-sacrifice in the story does not arise from the author's ignorance of the eschatological scheme that promises Israel the final victory. The chapter on Taxo serves as a transition from an historical survey to apocalyptic representations of the End and the kingdom of God. Chapters 10 through 12 develop the apocalyptic motif and provide clues indicative of the End. The book's promise of salvation is to the nation as a whole. Regardless 42. War II, viii, 10. The statement "in order to induce them [the Essenes] to blaspheme their lawgiver or to eat some forbidden thing" clearly draws on Second Maccabees. The talmudic reports indicate that the Roman decrees forced Jews to transgress only positive commandments. The transgression of negative commandments, such as eating pork and bowing before idols, was characteristic of Antiochus' persecution. "Confident that they would receive them back again" also echoes Second Maccabees. 43. According to S. Baron, it is possible that The Assumption ofMoses, also known as The Testament ofMoses, was written after the fall of Jerusalem. Baron, Social and Religious History, vol. 2, p. 59.

At the end of days "Israel will be happy," and God will cause the nation to "approach the heaven of the stars in the place of their habitation."45 Still, Taxo does not speak of the kingdom of God as the destination of his family or as their motivation for dying. Similar to the literary motifs in 2 Maccabees, Taxo is prepared to die for the tradition of his forefathers because of his fear of tempting God. In addition, he views his sacrifice as the atonement for the nation's sin. Observe, my sons, behold a second ruthless (and) unclean visitation has come upon the people, and a punishment merciless and far exceeding the first. For what nation or what region or what people of those who are impious toward the Lord, who have done many abominations, have suffered as great calamities as have befallen us? Now therefore my sons, hear me: for observe and know that neither did our fathers nor their forefathers tempt God, so as to transgress his commands. And ye know that this is our strength and thus we will do. Let us fast for the space of three days and on the fourth let us go into a cave which is in the field, and let us die rather than transgress the commands of the Lord of Lords, the God of our fathers. Although Taxo and his seven sons did not face an immediate threat, he believed that the blood of those sacrificed "will be avenged before the Lord" and so bring an end to the nation's suffering.46 The Assumption, too, then, deprives its protagonists of personal rewards. At first glance, however, it appears that Fourth Maccabees no longer denies martyrs their personal trophies. This contemporary of The Assumption makes a full and elaborate usage of the story of the seven martyred brothers.47 45. Chap. 10. Quotations are from Charles's edition. As J.

Others place the origin of the book</page><page sequence="15">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 15 But instead of physical resurrection after death, Fourth Maccabees promises its martyred protagonists an eternal existence. The descriptions of the martyrs' destiny in this rendition thus resembles the Essenes' view on the soul. Like the Essenes, Fourth Maccabees speaks of a belief in the immortal soul, yet in addition it offers a clearer picture of the souls of the martyrs in the beyond. The book presents the novel idea that the seven executed sons "now have their stand before the throne of God, and live the life of eternal blessedness." The author expounds that those who put their religion before their lives do so because they believe "that to God they die not, as neither did our patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but live to God." This assurance becomes more persuasive when the author advances such notions as the sons' conviction. They "knew too well that those who died for the sake of God live with God as do Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the patriarchs." Similar statements are uttered by the martyrs themselves: "When we have died in such fashion, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will receive us and all the patriarchs will praise us."48 Such martyrological statements contrast sharply with those noted earlier. Thus, in the first century Fourth Maccabees stands alone in Jewish martyrological literature. First-century Judaism rarely speaks in psychological terms of a dualism of body and soul,49 and does not provide a clear picture of the beyond. Excluding these atypical statements of reward, Fourth Maccabees corre- sponds with the general tenor of its period. Its main theme is the prevailing of the nation and not the martyrs' reward. Like the rest of the material analyzed above, the sons' motivation for dying hinges on their fear of transgression. in Alexandria. H. Lietzmann, The Beginnings of the Christian Church (New York, 1922), p. 107. In contrast, Hadas sets the origin of the book in Antioch, pp. 109-113. Similarly, G. W. Bowersock suggests Asia Minor as the book's source of origin, Martyrdom and Rome, p. 79, and inclines toward A. Dupont-Sommer's dating of it to the period of Trajan or Hadrian, Le quatridme livre des Machabees (Paris, 1939). 48. 4 Maccabees 17:18, 7:19, 16:25, 13:17, and see also the statement about the martyrs' mother in 17:5 "lighting the way to piety for your seven starlike sons; honored by God, and with them fixed in heaven. For your childbearing was of our Father Abraham [emphasis added]." These descriptions resonate contemporary Christian views, and it is possible that the accounts reflect Christian influence. The idea of the martyrs being received by the patriarchs has its parallel in Luke 20:37, "Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." 49. Dualism of human nature was more typical of Greek philosophy.

L. W. Grimm's linguistic-based argument that verse 7:19 ("believing that to God they die not") is a late interpolation and J. Freudenthal's rejection of verse 16:25 ("and they knew too well that those who die for the sake of God live with God") on the basis of a deficient syntactical connection." H. Anderson's observation that the martyrs' words in 9:8, "and we shall be with God on whose account we suffer," do not exist in one of the earliest manuscripts, further supports the theory of text manipulation.52 In particular, verse 17:18 ("whereby they now have their stand before the throne of God, and live the life of eternal blessedness") reveals a peculiar image and an abnormal grammatical structure that even Hadas, who makes an agonized effort to discount Grimm's and Freudenthal's proposals, cannot explain. He thus considers this verse "an odd conclusion to a sentence [v. 17] which begins with the effects upon the king" and suggests that the first part of the sentence (i.e., v. 17) "should continue with v. 23" instead of with the statement in question.3 Hadas, however, does not offer an alternative solution, thus leaving out verse 17 and its celestial description. Furthermore, according to Anderson, the phrase "living unto God" may indicate "no more than their [i.e., the martyrs'] final vindication by God.'"54 Finally, the biblical quotation ("I kill and I make alive" [Deuteronomy 32:39]) in verses 18:18-19 also creates difficulties of fluidity and an anachronistic depiction of Jewish history. It can additionally 50.

But the tyrant Antiochus was punished upon earth, and is yet chastised after his death" (18:4-5). 51. C. L. W.

[Ezekiel 37:3]) may refer to the notion of physical resurrection (as in 2 Maccabees), not necessarily to life in heaven. Notions of physical resurrection contradict heavenly depictions and would require the exclusion of heavenly rewards. These inharmonious verses in the text thus share two characteristics. As individual verses they grammatically and conceptually disagree with the rest of the text, yet they convey the same idea of glorious recompense. Based on the Jewish attitude toward death in the first century, the intermittent and infrequent delineations of the afterlife, and their obscure grammatical context in Fourth Maccabees, it is plausible that originally the book pursued the traditional line of martyrological thinking, which expected only the nation to benefit from an individual's voluntary death. The verses in question thus may imply a late interpolation by an editor who found these verses compatible with his conviction.55 As is well known, Fourth Maccabees became extremely popular among the Church Fathers, who often use the verses in question to describe their concept of martyrological recompense.56 55.

The grammatically odd verse "have their stand before the throne of God and live the life of eternal blessedness" has its parallel in Rev. 7:15. It is worth quoting this passage about Christian martyrs in full. "They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. That is why they stand before the throne of God and minister to him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will dwell with them.... the lamb who is at the heart of the throne will be their shepherd." According to St. Augustine, the Church preserved and honored the Maccabean books because of their martyred heroes. City of God 18:36.

As we are about to see, the book's impact on rabbinic sources was inconspicuous." Given the Pharisaic background of the emerging rabbinic leadership, the rejection of the present format of Fourth Maccabees and its rewards is not surprising. Tradition has it that the legendary Council of Jamnia embraced the Pharisaic idea of resurrection (tehiyyat ha-metim), which has become an axiom in Orthodox Judaism.58 To give the concept of resurrection more weight, several passages in the Talmud assert, in the name of Rabban Gamliel (San. 90b) and R. Meir, that "the resurrection is deducible from the Torah" (San. 91b), and thus, those who denounce the fundamental notion of tehiyyat ha-metim will not be resurrected at the end-of-days.59 In line with the Pharisees' eschatological formula, M. Avot 4:29 teaches that humanity as a whole will be resurrected, including the gentiles and the wicked. In contrast, other talmudic passages reserve the resurrection for the righteous.60 This would make the martyr a logical candidate for resurrection at the end-of-days. What needs to be examined is whether early rabbinic literature made resurrection or, more generally, reward part of the martyr's fate. Like the martyrological views we have seen in the Greco-Roman period, halakhic formulations justify intentional death only as a means of avoiding transgression, and lack of resurrection as a designated reward is one of the more obvious earmarks of rabbinic rulings on voluntary death in the name of God.61 Generally, these rabbinic formulations describe Jews who passively 57. Hadas rightly argues that "among the Jews, apparently, the book did not survive the Hellenized milieu out of which it rose," p. 123, and "It is true that Jewish tradition offers no direct evidence of a commemoration of the martyrs of IV Maccabees." But he then goes on to say: "It is natural to assume that the Christian commemoration of these martyrs was a continuation of a Jewish institution," p. 109. 58. To this day, the Eighteen Benedictions prayer, recited daily in synagogues, asserts: "You are eternally powerful, O Lord; You are mighty to save. You sustain the living with loving kindness. You make the dead live with great mercy. You support those who fall ... and carry out the faith to those how sleep in the dust. Who can be like You, master of powers, and who can resemble You, a king who brings death, and makes alive, and makes salvation sprout? You are reliable in that You bring the dead to life. Blessed are You, O Lord, who brings the dead back to life." Quoted in Sandmel, Judaism and Christian Beginnings, p. 148. 59. See also the second-century M. Sanhedrin 10.1. 60. Ket. Illb, San. 90a 61. San. 92b makes a connection between resurrection and the three protagonists of the Book of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were eventually viewed in Jewish</page><page sequence="19">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 19 give up their souls (notenim nafsham) or handed themselves over (masru a 'tzmam) for this reason only. In situations of death and life it is required to "let oneself be killed rather than transgress" (yehareg v 'al ya 'vor). The rabbis established the legal principle that death was required only to avoid three specific violations: idolatry, bloodshed, and prohibited sexual acts.62 With these decisions, the rabbis did not alter the biblical principle that life is superior to death.63 In addition to being a rabbinic authorization of lawful willing death, this set of rules emerges from an acute sense of the traditional appreciation of life and from the need to confine the assorted popular self-destructive tendencies that we have so far encountered. Thus it is stated in the name of R. Akiva that in all other cases Jews may violate the commandments to save life, while R. Ishmael held even a more lenient view. In his opinion, when forced in private (i.e., in the presence of fewer than ten Jews), one may worship idols rather than die, because of the importance of life--a concept today termed "the sanctity of life." Leviticus 18:5, "Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, which if a man does he shall literature as martyrs, although they had never died as such. To be sure, in the talmudic passage the miracle that the three companions experienced is related to the resurrection that Ezekiel envisioned, but the passage does not claim that resurrection is the martyrs' reward. The resurrection in the valley of Dura (Daniel 3:33) is one of six miracles that God performed on the day He saved the three biblical heroes in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar. In contrast, Agus sees a connection between martyrdom and resurrection in the passage. Binding of Isaac and the Messiah, pp. 43-44. Pesikta de-Rab Kahana, zot habberaka, associates Isaac's akedah with the future resurrection of Israel. It is not clear whether the Pesikta views Isaac as an actual sacrifice, although he is depicted as a willing participant. The nature of resurrection, however, is identical to what the Pharisees had envisioned; that is, the final and predetermined apocalyptic event in which God will bring the dead to life, only here the resurrection of the nation, not of Isaac, will come to be because of his willingness to be sacrificed. On the development of the notion of the actual akedah, see J. D. Levenson, The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son (New Haven, 1993), esp. pp. 173-199. 62. Similar prohibitions already existed in the Book of Jubilees, chap. 20. See again Safrai, "Qiddush ha-Shem, " p. 39. 63. For example, Baba Kama 61 a, "No halakhic matter may be quoted in the name of one who surrenders himself to meet death for words of the Torah." Baba Kama, followed by the story of David pouring out the water brought him by his soldiers (2 Sam. 23:16-17), emphasizes that one should not look forward to risking his life in the name of the Torah. Also, Ber. 3a, 8b, Tan. 5b, Shab. 32a, Pes. 112a. On the importance of life in the Bible, see M. Greenberg, "The Sanctity of Life in the Bible" (Hebrew), in Sanctity of Life and Martyrdom, ed. I. M. Gafni and A. Ravitzky (Jerusalem, 1992), pp. 35-54.</page><page sequence="20">20 SHMUEL SHEPKARU live by them," provided the balance wheel for R. Ishmael rulings.64 Other legal opinions in the Talmud add more restrictions or further build upon these principles,65 but what they all have in common is their disregard of reward. From its very beginning, voluntary death was only used as a tool in legal deliberations for instructing Jews on how to maintain a moral Jewish life in times of duress. The biblical regard for life prevented talmudic rabbis from transforming martyrdom into an attractive practice; thus in their ordinances concerning intentional death, they did not include individual benefits that transcend the act itself. While these opinions represent legal decisions, talmudic narratives of martyrdom do not tend to depart from R. Akiva's and R. Ishmael's basic formulas relating to purposeful death.66 The talmudic version of the story of the anonymous mother and her seven sons displays the same tendency. Gittin 57b strips the story of the rewards mentioned in the Maccabean books. The absence of rewards--either resurrection in the physical world or immortality in heaven-indicates the rabbis' intentional elimination of the concept of individual recompense from the original story. Lamentations Rabba 53 on Lamentations 1:16 also presents a version of the story of the mother, now named Miriam bat Tanhum, and her seven sons. Like Gittin 57b, the early midrash ignores the Maccabean rewards and asserts that "a human being lives today and is dead tomorrow"; God, in contrast, "lives and endures for all eternity." Moreover, the midrash emphasizes that only fear of transgression motivated the sons, who believed that God would avenge their blood and bring retribution on the oppressor (this time Caesar) and his people.67 64. On the verse and its meaning, see D. Schwartz, "What Should He Answer? And He Should Live by Them" (Hebrew), in Sanctity of Life, pp. 69-83. 65. San. 74a-b, 75a, 110b; A.Z. 27b; Pes. 25a-b, 26a, 53b; Shab. 130a; YT San. 3, 21b. 66. This is not to say that these narratives do not have legal functions. One of the purposes of these narratives is to validate the halakhic rulings, but their legal implications need to be deduced. 67. In Pesikta Rabbati 43 the mother is saying to her hesitant young son: "O my son, do you wish that in the time-to-come all your brothers be in the bosom of Abraham?" The phrase "the time-to-come" is missing in the Nushat Ha-Garaz printed edition, while Friedmann's edition, based on the Vienna 1880 editio princeps, adds to the mother's statement: "while you are in the bosom of Esau." R. Ulmer notes in her synoptic edition of Pesikta Rabbati that the Warsaw, 1893 edition and the Friedmann edition, Vienna, 1880, are inadequate. Moreover, she writes: "Friedmann frequently emended the text based upon his own conjecture." (Atlanta, 1977), vol. 1, p. xxxvii. This may explain the unusual ending and statement in the story and may suggest a late "emendation," in my opinion medieval. "In the bosom of Abraham" is frequently used in</page><page sequence="21">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 21 These deliberate eliminations of reward were intended to emphasis the main motif of the talmudic versions: the absolute commitment to Law and loyalty to God. Elimination of recompense dismissed doubts about selfishness and made it clear that the traditional concept of reverence alone inspired the martyrs, their sole aim being to avoid transgression. Other talmudic narratives describe the new application of halakhic rules on voluntary death during the Roman persecutions of rabbinic leaders. The late Midrash Eleh Ezkerah combined these talmudic stories into one unit with various versions, known as the powerful story of the Ten Martyrs (Aseret Harugei Malkhut).68 Three motifs characterize these talmudic narratives: (1) the rabbis do not seek martyrdom (as instructed by Baba Kama 61 a), (2) they insist on passive death (i.e., in accordance with the halakhic view, they did not take their own lives), and (3) they do not directly associate the act with recompense. Information regarding these rabbis is not always comprehensive, and important questions regarding their martyrdom remain unanswered. Still, it is safe to remark that the stories revolve around the religious and social commitment of these protagonists to the Law and their communities during times of duress. Hullin 142a, Kid. 39b, and YT Hag. 2:1 laconically mention the deaths of Judah the Baker, Huzpit, and Yesebab without providing relevant details. In fact, YT Hag. 2:1 reveals that Judah the Baker's death without a reward or acknowledgment caused the great scholar R. Elisha ben Abuya to turn against the Torah, denying the rabbinic idea of the resurrection of the dead. Seeing R. Judah the Baker's tongue in the mouth of a dog, Elisha said: "This is the Torah, and this its reward. This is the tongue that was bringing forth the words of the Torah as befits them. ... This is the Torah, and this the Hebrew narratives of the First Crusade. These sources and their descriptions are discussed below. Meanwhile, "He [God] will place him [R.

It seems as though there is no reward and no resurrection of the dead."69 Among the more elaborate descriptions that permit a sound analysis are the executions of R. Judah ben Baba, R. Akiva, and R. Haninah ben Teradyon. Let us commence with the obvious: The story of R. Judah ben Baba makes no use of reward whatsoever. If anything, the story attests to the importance of the gift of life. Judah ben Baba urged his students to flee and save their lives. Because of his old age he stayed behind and faced a gruesome execution. But his heroism was not in vain, although he did not benefit from his altruism in any way. The true beneficiary was the nation, for "were it not for him, the laws of kenas would have been forgotten in Israel and might have been abolished."70 This testimony reveals the true nature of Judah ben Baba's altruism: endangering his life to the point of wasting it for the gain of the nation. The martyrdom of R. Akiva receives more attention; he is the most celebrated archetype in Jewish martyrological tradition. Ber. 61b, YT. Ber. 9, 14, 2, and YT. Sotah 5, 20, 3 attribute to Akiva the question, "When shall I have the opportunity of fulfilling this ["And thou shalt love the Lord God with all thy soul and with all thy might," Deuteronomy 6:5]?" This question features his death as a long-awaited aspiration to be worthy of dying, and it might be assumed that it alludes to Akiva's expectation of individual recompense. But as S. Safrai has observed, Ber. and YT Sotah in the Leiden and Rome manuscripts do not include this statement, which reads syntactically awkwardly in the text.71 The allusion to Akiva's expectation of an individual reward in return reflects the understandings of later editors. 69. Thereafter, he is mentioned as Aher, i.e., a different man or a stranger. Kid. 39b. 70. San. 14a; A.Z. 8b, 27b; Y. A.Z. 2:2, 4, I; Shab. 14:4. See also Krauss, "Ten Martyrs," pp. 111-112; 0.

Jellinek (Jerusalem, 1938), 6:27. In contrast, see Bet ha-Midrash, 3:34. Thus it could be that "destined to the world to come" is a late medieval addition, a possibility that will become more persuasive as this article progresses.</page><page sequence="23">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 23 Immediately after his death, we are told, the divine voice (bat qol) proclaimed, "Happy are you, Akiva, that your soul has departed with the word ehad [of the Shema benediction]." Akiva's proclamation of the Shema, despite the Romans' efforts to stop him, is the reward itself. The divine voice considered Akiva's last-breath Shema a meritorious act in its own right. Akiva's initial martyrological reward was martyrdom.72 Both acknowledging and protesting Akiva's end, "The ministering angels said before the Holy One, blessed be He: 'Such Torah, and such a reward?' "73 Only after that did the bat qol proclaim that Akiva's fate was changed; he was destined now "for the life of the world to come." What needs to be remembered, though, is that Akiva was concerned only with avoiding transgression. In Akiva's words, "It is better that I myself should die than that I should transgress against the opinion of my colleagues."74 Particularly revealing is the dialogue between God and Moses in B. Men. 29b. God reveals to Moses the future of the Jewish people. Impressed by Akiva's piety and knowledge of Torah, Moses asks God to show him Akiva's reward. Instead He shows him Akiva's gruesome execution. Seeing this, Moses cries: "Lord of the universe, such is Torah, and such is its reward?" God responds: "Be silent, for such is My decree." Both the question and the answer are equally important. While the answer does not mention reward, we should note that Moses bases his argument for reward on the fact that Akiva taught the Law and enlightened the people, not on his execution.75 72. This corresponds with another amoraic opinion that only a commandment (misvah) can be the reward for performing a misvah. Avot 4:2, B. Ber. 17a. The precepts that are related to reward are "honoring father and mother, the practice of loving kindness, and making peace between man and his fellow; but the study of the Torah is equal to them all," M. Pe'ah 1:1. Urbach, Sages, pp. 346, 443-444. On the commandments, see S. Safrai, Be Shilhe ha-Bayit ha-Sheni uvi-Tekufat ha-Mishnah (Jerusalem, 1983), p. 103; See also D. Flusser on the Torah and reward, "He Has Planted It [i.e., the Law] as Eternal Life in Our Midst" (Hebrew), Tarbiz 58 (1988-89): 47-153; Friedman, "In the Past: 'May He Plant His Torah in Our Hearts'-In the Future" ( Hebrew), Tarbiz 60 (1990-91): 265-268; Schiffman, "At the Crossroads," p. 141. 73. Ber. 61b; and see Tanchuma, Tetzave 5. 74. Eru. 21 lb. In answering R. Eliezer's question regarding the meaning of Deuteronomy 6:5, Akiva interprets that one should love God "even if He takes away thy soul," but no divine reward is mentioned. Lack of reward indicates the true nature of the devotee's unconditional love of God. 75. Lack of reward is emphasized in the story of R. Simeon ben Gamliel and R. Ishmael the High Priest. Watching the execution of his colleague, R. Ishmael cried bitterly, "Where is Torah, and where is its reward?" Next, during R. Ishmael's execution, "The ministering angels said to the Holy One: 'Such a righteous man, to whom You showed all the treasures of the</page><page sequence="24">24 SHMUEL SHEPKARU The phrase "the world to come" is also mentioned in the martyrdom of R. Hananiah ben Teradyon. Before examining the conjunction of martyrdom and reward, it merits mention that the account begins with Haninah ben Teradyon's explicit appreciation of life. His dialogue with R. Eleazar ben Perata clarifies that Teradyon did not view his coming execution as a positive event. He considers R. Eleazar ben Perata to be the more fortunate, because Eleazar will be rescued, while he will be executed. Happy art thou [R. Eleazar ben Perata], who has been arrested on five charges, but will be rescued; woe is me [R. Haninah ben Teradyon], who, though arrested on one charge [studying Torah], will not be rescued.76 Could R. Haninah ben Teradyon's devotion go unnoticed? Or would he be, perhaps, compensated for his reverence and rescued in the world to come? If that were the case, R. Haninah ben Teradyon should have considered himself the fortunate one. But R. Haninah ben Teradyon "will not be rescued" from his coming execution on only the admission of pursuing the study of Torah. In contrast, R. Eleazar is rewarded with life, for he occupied himself with Torah as well as with acts of benevolence. In San. 8:12 supernatural reward had no part in R. Haninah ben Teradyon's decision to ignore the Roman decrees, nor had it a part in his expectations. Watching her father burning together with the Torah scroll, Teradyon's daughter exclaims in horror the same words attributed to R. Elisha ben Abuya and Moses: "Is that the Torah and this its reward?" The only visible consolation is the unique act itself. Haninah ben Teradyon's reply reaffirms this assumption. My daughter, if it is for me that you are weeping and for me that you throw yourself on the ground, it is better that a fire made by man should consume me, rather than a fire not made by man. ... But if it is for the Torah scroll that worlds above and the mysteries of the worlds below--should he be put to death in so strange a way? Such is Torah and such is its reward?'... A divine voice came forth and said: 'If I hear another [such] cry, I will turn the world to void and desolation!' When R. Ishmael heard this, he fell silent." Midrash Ele Ezkerah, in Bet ha-Midrash, 2:64-72. This Midrash focuses on the punishment of "the wicked government" and the elimination of Israel's enemy in return for the sacrifice of the ten rabbis, not as their reward. 76. A.Z. 17b.</page><page sequence="25">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 25 you are weeping, lo, the Torah is fire, and fire cannot consume fire. Behold, the letters are flying into the air, and only the parchment itself is burning. The awe of God emerges once again as the driving force in overcoming the natural dread of physical pain. A bit more comforting is the parallel version in A.Z. 18a. Here Haninah ben Teradyon hopes that God will have regard for his plight, although in what manner remains a conundrum. But before his execution, an optimistic Haninah ben Teradyon rejects R. Jose ben Kisma's advice to refrain from violating the Roman decrees. Teradyon can only hope that "heaven will show mercy." The answer strikes Jose ben Kisma as an irrational and irresponsible attitude, which will lead to Teradyon's execution and Torah burning. Unlike the other mentioned martyrs, Teradyon's concern was, how did he "stand with regard to the world to come?" This question to R. Jose ben Kisma projects Teradyon's own doubts regarding his fate after death. Voluntary death is not to be the determining factor of his fate. As if to answer Teradyon's uncertainty, the Talmud tells that a bat qol declares that he is assigned to the world to come. What remains unclear here is: (1) what exactly is meant by "the world to come," and (2) whether it is Teradyon's voluntary death that guarantees him a place in the world to come or whether the world to come is a recurrent talmudic promise to all Jews. A.Z. 18a-b provides an answer only to the second question.77 This answer provides the key to our understanding of the atypical conjunction of voluntary death and the world to come in the text. To determine whether Teradyon is destined to the world to come, Jose ben Kisma needed additional information. "Is there any particular act that thou hast done?" he inquired. He replied: "I once mistook Purim-money for ordinary charity-money, and I distributed [of my own] to the poor." "Well then," said he, "would that thy portion were my portion and thy lot my lot." 77. It is possible that "the world to come" in Akiva's and Teradyon's accounts refers to a posthistoric existence, i.e., the Pharisaic view of the resurrection of the dead at the end-of-time, instead to a heavenly postmortem existence. See, for example, Shab. 89a, where it is stated that the heavenly realm is reserved for angels and not for human beings. A.Z. 17a generally indicates that the reward of the righteous is eternal life, which means after the resurrection. See also the prelude to R. Haninah ben Teradyon's story in 18a, where the world to come is associated with resurrection. Another association between the world to come and resurrection can be found in Kid. 39b.</page><page sequence="26">26 SHMUEL SHEPKARU Kisma's inquiry betokens that Teradyon's approaching death does not provide a ready answer to the question of martyrological merit. Like ben Kisma's question, the answer completely overlooks the fact that he is about to be executed; it centers only upon a single good deed Teradyon has done. Teradyon's merit is not based on his voluntary death; distribution of his own money for the poor secured his place in the world to come.78 Perhaps the best conspectus of this approach is provided by Baba Bathra 10b. As a starting point, it asserts, without mentioning martyrdom, that every scholar who is honored for his wisdom will attain the world to come. R. Joseph the son of R. Joshua confirmed this view in a trance, while having a brush with death. The ailing Joseph visualizes the martyred rabbis as individuals so unique that "no creature can attain to their place." But "had they no other merit but this [martyrdom]?" the tractate continues. To reconfirm the merit of all Torah scholars regardless of martyrdom, it is concluded that "Obviously even without this [act, they would have attained this rank]." Martyrdom was only one aspect of the exclusiveness of these martyred rabbis. Those martyred by the Romans received their reward on the basis of how they lived their lives, and not on the basis of how they ended them. The story makes one more significant comment. R. Joseph also envisioned the future world in his trance. He witnessed "a world upside down, the upper below and the lower above"; an atypically skimpy report, but a heartening promise to sufferers in general. His socially oriented vision testified to a scrupulously just existence in the future world, which does not appear to be of heavenly nature. In that place the poor will gain the upper hand. This promise, however, did not hang on self-sacrifice. Finally, life in the future world and voluntary death surface in another talmudic story. In Gittin 57b the protagonists are four hundred boys and girls who are transported for sexual enslavement. When they discover what is in store for them, they decide to drown themselves. In contrast to the rabbinic martyrs, the story of the four hundred youths describes a self-inflicted death. The account opens with the children's question: "If we drown in the sea, will we reach the life of the world to come?" They find an answer in Psalm 78. Teradyon's Roman executioner also received a share in the world to come. Here we see the principle once again: he received his reward for expediting Teradyon's death (in order to bring quick relief from the torture), and not for his self-annihilation that followed, A.Z. 18a. A similar story is told in Tan. 29a. Here, too, the Roman officer, who found R. Gamliel in his hiding place, asks, "If I save you, will you bring me into the world to come?" His suicide, which followed, was not a factor in the dialogue.</page><page sequence="27">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 27 68:23, "I will bring again from the depths of the sea." This answer convinces first the girls and then the boys to leap into the sea. To be sure, the children do not ask whether voluntary death, specifically, will lead to the world to come. Nor are they troubled by their active method of departing. Entering the world to come was an inevitable event according to the eschatological premise; the world to come was a posthistoric development that appeared obvious to the youths. Their doubts arise because of the place of death they are forced to embrace.79 Since they were about to drown in the sea without a final resting place, they wondered whether they would still acquire life in the future world.s0 The youths did not perceive their noble act as the ultimate fast pass to the afterlife. Deemed worthy of mention is that all of the cited narratives share several common factors. They all describe situations that Jews find themselves in unwillingly. In these situations they employ the option of voluntary death only to avoid transgressions. Voluntary death does not emerge as a good deed, a misvah, that could guarantee a place in the word to come. This is also true in the accounts of the martyred rabbis, which equivocally mention reward only in regard to R. Akiva and R. Haninah ben Teradyon. This is not to weaken, however, the talmudic notion of divine justice in the next existence. According to this divine system, good deeds bring the individual 79. Doubts that the dead could be resurrected from the sea come into play in Eusebius' narration of the Christian martyrs of Lyons. Eusebius reassured his readers that even drowning in large bodies of water could not prevent the martyrs' physical resurrection. After disposing of the ashes of the martyrs in the Rhone River, "that they may have no hope of resurrection," their persecutors sarcastically exclaimed: "Now let us see if they will rise again and if their god can help them and save them from our hands." History of the Church 5:1, 60-63. The same question regarding the resurrection of those who kill themselves by drowning is asked by R. Moses' wife in the famous story of the four captives in Abraham ibn Daud's Sefer ha-Qabbalah (The Book of Tradition), ed. and trans. G. D. Cohen (Philadelphia, 1967), pp. 63-64. 80. Ket. 111 b deals with the same question of where the eschatological drama would take place. According to Ket. 111 b, everyone will be resurrected, "even a Canaanite maidservant," as long as they dwell in the land of Israel. "Those who die outside the land of Israel will not live again ... and those who die in the land of My delight will live again, but those who do not die there will not." The emphasis on the word "land" could only increase the complication of the youths' dilemma. Because of the talmudic approach to the importance of the place of resurrection, it became common for Diaspora Jews to send decomposed bodies to the Land of Israel for burial. Other rabbinic opinions compromised and promised a miraculous universal gathering of the dead in the Land of Israel for the purpose of resurrection. Pesikta Rabbati 1:6, Ket. 35b. See also Raphael, Jewish Views of the Afterlife, pp. 158-160.</page><page sequence="28">28 SHMUEL SHEPKARU closer to the world to come, while evil deeds generate divine punishments.8s The martyrological stories do not challenge this talmudic system of divine justice, known in Hebrew as middah ke 'neged middah, nor do they disclose the nature of reward. The dilemmas concerning voluntary death reveal that the act was not considered an ultimate good deed, a misvah, in its own right. While forms of existence in the world to come were not to be disavowed, voluntary death did not guarantee a reward after death.82 As the martyrdom of R. Haninah ben Teradyon proves, good deeds were viewed as a more powerful vehicle toward reward than voluntary death. At best, voluntary death served to prevent the performance of forced evil acts. Indirectly, by his voluntary death a person could prevent the accrual of transgressions in the final divine count.83 In the Talmud, the power of martyrdom springs from its ability to prevent sin. Submission to death functioned as a restricted obligatory act, which was not sanctioned in order to endorse the notion of reward in the afterlife. With this view well established, the Jews entered the Middle Ages. Byzantine Jewry was the first European Jewry to put these views into practice and to associate the victims with divine sacrifice. A tenth-century epistle from the community of Bari to the celebrated Cordovan courtier Hasday ibn Shaprut describes the first known acknowledgment of Jewish martyrdom on European soil in the Middle Ages. Reminiscent of the Hadrianic persecutions of the talmudic rabbis and the prohibitions of Torah study, the epistle reports how, The holy congregation of Otranto has lost three associates (re'im) for they were compelled by that cursed decree. Their names were Ray Isaiah ... and R. Menahem ... and their disciple Elijah. R Isaiah took in his hand the knife 81. For example, the importance of observing the Sabbath and dwelling in the sukkah as meritorious acts is discussed by J. L. Rubenstein, "An Eschatological Drama: Bavli Avodah Zarah 2a-3b," AJS Review 1 (1996): 1-37. Note that in the world to come the eternal reward, symbolized by the sukkah, is collective, and is reserved for the nation of Israel for studying Torah in this world. On the concept of divine justice, see again Urbach, Sages, pp. 448-461. 82. Some talmudic passages indicate that those who were ready to die in order to avoid transgression received their reward in this life (like the biblical heroes Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah), because miracles were performed to save them from death. See the case of R. Jonathan in A.Z. 17a-b or Kid. 39b. 83. Kid. 40a-b.</page><page sequence="29">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 29 and slashed his throat like a sacrificial lamb in the Temple court. R. Menahem leaped into a pit. Seeing that his sun had darkened, Elijah strangled himself.84 Two central symbols uncover what the martyrs tried to accomplish and how the community viewed voluntary death. R. Isaiah, who "took in his hand the knife," alludes to Isaac's akedah, while the rest of the description clearly identifies Isaiah with the sacrificial lamb in the Temple court (korban olah). The three martyrs functioned as atonements, sacrificing themselves for the common good. It was not a coincidence, therefore, that the community was miraculously "delivered from darkness to light" exactly on the third day. Each self-sacrifice atoned for one day of persecution. Because of them, the epistle reports, "even one letter of the Torah was not burned there.""8 Moreover, not only did human sacrifices save the community, they also caused it to flourish and become an important Torah center.86 The benefits from these human self-sacrifices, then, were confined to the living.87 No reward is said to have been the martyrs' lot.88 84. The epistle was published by J. Mann in Text and Studies in Jewish History and Literature, 2 vols. (Cincinnati, 1931), vol. 1, pp. 23-24. Since the epistle mentions the Book of Josippon, it is obvious that it was written after 953, the time the book came to light. See the introduction to Sefer Josippon, ed. D. Flusser, 2 vols. (Jerusalem, 1981), esp. vol. 2, p. 63, n. 183, p. 165; idem, "The Author of Sefer Josippon: His Character and His Period," (Hebrew), Zion 18 (1953): 109-126. Also, Y.

The last known persecution in Italy during the Byzantine regime took place under Emperor Romanus I, who was deposed in 944. The epistle may have been written against this background. 85. This is reminiscent of R. Haninah ben Teradyon's death with the Torah. In his case, too, the letters of the Torah did not burn. 86. Mann, Text and Studies, 1:25. 87. This is despite the author's familiarity with Sefer Josippon, which promises paradise, "the great light," and a "good hotel" to Jews. Flusser, Sefer Josippon, 1:382, 424. This notion is elaborated in the later (12th cent.) "version c" of the book. On these images, see Baer, "Hebrew Sefer Josipphon," pp. 194-195, 199-203, and compare with Flusser, Sefer Josippon, 2:32, n. 82, pp. 96-98. In the epistle, only the community's lot shifts from darkness to light. 88. It is worthy of mention that Justinian's sixth-century Novella 146 accuses the Jews of renouncing the belief in resurrection, the end-of-days, and the day ofjudgment. J. Juster sees in these accusations a proof of the long impact of Sadducee doctrines on Byzantine Jews, which</page><page sequence="30">30 SHMUEL SHEPKARU Lack of personal recompense also marks an anonymous Hebrew report on events between the years 1007 and 1012 in France.89 The report depicts King Robert's vigorous efforts to convert the Jews of his kingdom, offering them the alternatives of conversion or expulsion. Less fortunate were the Jews of Rouen (and perhaps other unspecified localities), who had to choose between conversion and death. The fairly detailed report, which is buttressed by two Latin accounts, portrays the heroism of the victims and their various modes of reacting.90 Members of a Jewish delegation at the king's palace "stretched out their throats to be slain"; women drowned themselves in rivers; and "fathers did not spare their children, nor children their fathers."9' The source reveals the martyrs' motivation. Those in the palace were ready to be killed "for the sanctity of His name and unity." Women went to their deaths so as "not to desecrate the Name of Heaven." Fathers and children killed one other in order "not to profane the Venerable Name." For these individuals "death was better than life," because it served to avoid "heeding the wicked." With these statements the anonymous author concludes the martyrs' actions. The victims meet a dreadful end to avoid conversion, without benefitting from their deaths. In contrast, the living prospered because of these sacrifices. eventually led to Karaism. Les Juifs dans 1 'Empire romain, 2 vols. (Paris, 1914), 1:377-374. See also Ch.

Focusing on the advantages life has to offer, the report does more than associate the victims' sacrifices with the termination of the persecution; it insinuates that the personal sacrifices resulted in the astonishing accomplish- ments of the community, which became the birth-mother of budding Jewish settlements in northern Europe. Their successors, however, were less fortunate. Franco-German Jewry fell prey to crusader bands on their way to Jerusalem. These attacks resulted in numerous cases of mass suicide in the spring and summer months of 1096. Depictions of rewards abound in three Hebrew documents pertaining to these bloody events.92 In these documents martyrological reward stands literally worlds away from what is depicted in the previous sources. Terms describing the medieval martyrs, such as "the pious of High" (hassidi Elyon) and "the Supreme God" (El Elyon), are taken literally to mean living dwellers in heaven. Acts of voluntary death on earth initiate the dwellers' ascent93 92. The three Hebrew documents were first published in a critical edition by A. Neubaure and M. Stern in Hebraische Berichte uber die Judenverfolgungen wahrend der Kreuzzuge (Berlin, 1892). They were reprinted in A. Habermann, Sefer Gezerot Ashkenaz ve-Zarfat.

These are fundamental concepts that the Hebrew sources reiterate time and again. Take, for example, the dialogue that one of the Hebrew reports attributes to the Jews of Mainz while they are surrounded by the army of the notorious Emico. R. Kalonymus bar Meshullam and his followers encouraged each other to endure death because it would unlock the gates of heaven for them. "Let us be strong and suffer the yoke of the sacred awe. For the moment the enemy will kill us. ... But we shall remain alive and endure, our souls in the Garden of Eden, in the luminous great mirror forever. Happy are we if we do His will. Happy is everyone who is killed and slaughtered and dies for the sanctification of His name. He shall be destined to the world to come and shall sit in the circle of the righteous, R. Akiva and his associates, "the pillars of the universe," who were killed for His name." Than they all cried out unanimously in a loud voice: ". .. Let us go quickly and sacrifice ourselves before the Lord."95 The sanctification of God's name in the here-and-now did not terminate the martyrs' worldly activities. God chose these martyrs to be "His portion, because they had the vigor and valor to stand in His palace and perform His command and to sanctify His exalted Name in His world."96 The sanctifica- tions of God's name continued before Him in heaven perpetually. Thus they denote both the terrestrial price for and the sublime prize of admittance. In contrast to the talmudic depictions of martyrdom, the world to come is no longer an abstract notion. The martyrs "exchange a world of darkness for a world of light, a world of misfortune for a world of blissfulness, and a transitory world for an eternal world." Life in heaven is utterly different from life on earth; reward is not only eternal, but also personal. "Each one of them" is dressed in "eight apparels of glorious clouds, each one is crowned 94. Habermann, "to stand in His palace," p. 73; "they are in the King's palace," p. 74; "hassidai Elyon," pp. 26, 29, 75; "they are bonded in the bond of life in the King's chamber," p. 82, to mention only a few examples. 95.

Moreover, God will recompense each martyr by allowing him or her to experience the unthinkable: seeing and joining God Himself. The account commences with the familiar theme of separation between the lower and higher realms. The "pious of High (hassidei Elyon) were sanctified to ascend to God all together in purity and holiness." Thereafter, it was believed, We shall exist in a world that is entirely daylight, in paradise, in the luminous mirror. We shall see Him eye to eye, in His glory and in His greatness. Each of us shall receive a golden crown on his head, in which precious stones and pearls are placed. We shall sit there among "the pillars of the universe" and shall dine with the circle of the saintly in paradise. We shall be in the circle of R. Akiva and his companions. We shall sit on a golden throne under the Tree of Life. Each of us shall point at Him with his finger and say: "Here is our God whom we hoped for, and we shall rejoice and exult in His salvation." There we shall observe the Sabbath, for here, in this world of darkness, we cannot rest and observe it adequately. They all came rejoicing and exulting before the heavenly God. Similarly, they were happy to run and enter into the innermost chambers of paradise.98 These exceptional heavenly endowments are compared to precious physical goods reserved solely for Europe's aristocrats. Yet existence in "the luminous mirror" is not just a mirror image of an improved terrestrial realm."99 God's celestial palace is now shared exclusively with each martyr of past and present. Such powerful images served not only to rationalize the "calamity of the generation" post factum. The authors of the Hebrew documents present these images as the faith that motivated the martyrs to give up their lives. Compensation is featured as a significant element in their conscious final decisions. Death also attracted Rabbi Yequtiel bar Meshullam and his son-in-law, who managed to escape a deadly attack. Their case demonstrates not only the 97. Habermann, Gezerot, p. 82. 98. Habermann, Gezerot, pp. 48-49; Eidelberg, Jews and the Crusaders, p. 56; Chazan, L, pp. 281-282. 99.

After fleeing from Mainz, the two decided to return to their town to realize their death wish. Rabbi Yequtiel bar Meshullam and his son-in-law were killed there on the road between Mainz and Rudesheim when they returned to the place where Rabbi Kalonymus, his brother, the parnas, had been killed [with his followers], for they intended to return to the city, Mainz, in order that the enemy would kill and bury them there in the cemetery with their brethren the pious, upright, and innocent. '00 Another good demonstration, among several, is furnished by the case of R. Samuel bar Gedaliah and Yehiel bar Samuel. After surviving a wave of crusader attacks, the two escaped to a nearby lake in order to drown themselves. The dialogue attributed to the two friends explains their twofold motive: Better to die here [in the lake] for His great Name and to stroll with the saintly ones in paradise than that these uncircumcised and unclean seize us and sully us against our will with their evil waters.I'0 Throughout the three Hebrew sources on 1096, the reader is reminded that "those who were killed for the sanctification of His holy Name, the sublime God, [are destined] for the life of the world-to-come. Their souls will reside in paradise, bound up in the bonds of life." Reward, then, played an essential role in the eleventh-century martyrological concept. By developing a detailed doctrine of celestial reward, the martyrs, we are told, conquered the natural fear they encountered on their long voyage to their final destination. Clearly, many of the besieged Jews preferred to kill themselves to prevent forced conversion or torturous death at the hands of the crusaders.'02 At the 100.

Circulating rumors of the total eradication of Rhineland Jewry and the loss of relatives and friends depleted the will to live, but the defeat of the will to live was complemented by a strong will to live again in the upper world. The visible motivation for this group of people is a combination of survivor guilt, in some cases due to conversion, and the attraction of the glorious world to come, where the dead can be rejoined. Isaac the son of David the parnas and his friend Uri, for example, reversed their insincere conversions by sacrificing themselves after the crusaders had continued on their way. First, Isaac sacrificed his two sons as his atonement in the synagogue, so that they would "come before the unique and eternal King and before the throne of His glory." For himself, Isaac hoped, through self-sacrifice, to do "penitence and 'to be faithful and perfect with the Lord God' of Israel .... Perhaps He will do according to His loving-kindness and I shall still attain my comrades and come to be with them, to the great light."'03 This is not a self-sacrifice in the face of danger. His sacrifices were calculated for the purpose of entering the divine celestial chamber so as to be with his loved ones. Particularly illuminating in regard to the attraction of reward is the case of a certain Jewish convert from Xanten. As he was starting a fresh life alone in a new Jewish community, family ties and friendships did not play the same role in his commitment as in other members' behavior. The anonymous convert based his decision on one factor alone. Perhaps revealing his position in the community, he wondered how his non-Jewish roots would influence his fate in the world to come. "He asked R. Moses, the high priest: 'My lord, if I slaughter myself for the unity of His great Name, what will be my fate?"' The answer could not have been more promising: You shall sit with us in our circle, for you shall be a true convert and sit with the rest of the saintly true converts in their circle. You shall be with our ancestor Abraham, who was the first of the converts. Hearing the rabbi's response, the convert slaughtered himself without hes- itation. "His soul," the chronicle continues, "is bound up in the bond of life, in paradise, in the light of the Lord."'14 According to the Hebrew and 103.

In the Bari epistle the phrase "from darkness to light" symbolized the end of oppression,</page><page sequence="36">36 SHMUEL SHEPKARU Latin sources, many Jews, like the convert from Xanten, were the authors of their own deaths.'15 The Hebrew sources link this pattern of behavior to the belief in a heavenly postmortem existence. Accordingly, "These saintly ones desired to sanctify the revered and awesome Name with joy and cheer, like a man going to a feast, and to declare his unity."'" Such notions of martyrdom and its reward continued to characterize the writings of Franco-German Jews well after the First Crusade. It is not within our framework to mention all the medieval Jewish sources that make similar use of these notions."7 But it is clear enough that the popularity of these martyrological notions soon reached the point of becoming a major attribute of Ashkenazic literature and belief, until they overflowed into a variety of Jewish sources and Jewries.'08 What caused this clear nexus between martyrdom and immediate reward? How can we explain the transformation from an existing (although not consistent) rabbinic reluctance to combine martyrdom and reward, or, at best, from a nebulous resurrection or olam ha-ba, to an intricate and elaborate conception of heavenly reward in the presence of God? A logical explanation would be the survivors' natural need to rationalize the tragic outcome of the crusaders' butchery. Compensating all casualties of crusader violence with the only possible reward, therefore, enabled the living to cope with the painful realization of physical defeat. Not only had "the enemy of God" slaughtered His people without being punished, they had also defeated the Muslims and captured the land that He had promised to His but in the Hebrew sources of 1096 it denotes the martyrs' transition from the physical to the divine realm. 105.

Heavenly recompense transformed the victims into the victorious."' This interpretation alone, however, would not explain the course and metaphors employed in the Hebrew narratives. Martyrdom and reward were not only a product of internal needs, but also a result of complicated acculturation between Jews and their Christian neighbors."2 The Hebrew sources on 1096 reveal the same intense martyrological ideas that served the propaganda of the First Crusade. Although the four versions of Pope Urban II's speech at Clermont do not all utilize the term "martyrdom," references to the act and its reward abound. Urban offered his listeners "the only warfare that is righteous, for it is charity to risk your life for your brothers," and promised that they would "achieve everlasting glory" with their "own blood."'13 In all of the four reconstructed speeches, Urban is portrayed as presenting the Crusade as a form of potential martyrdom, because the crusaders' sacrifice would lead to either the terrestrial or celestial Jerusalem. Guibert of Nogent included the term "martyrdom" in his version of the pontiff's speech and presented it as a "glorious gift" (gloriosum martyrii munus). Trying to recruit 109. According to Baldric of Dol's version of Pope Urban's speech at Clermont, the pontiff compared the crusaders to the children of Israel, who were led out of Egypt by divine force and "have taken that land [of Israel] by their arms, with Jesus as leader. They have driven out the Jebusites and other inhabitants and have themselves inhabited earthly Jerusalem, the image of celestial Jerusalem." RHC Oc., 4:12-16. 110.

Now we propose to you wars which hold the glorious gift of martyrdom, which now and forever will restore the praised title.114 According to Balderic of Dol, Urban assured his audience that "giving your life for your brother is an exceptionally good work of charity,""' which, Fulcher of Chartres explained, brings "eternal reward for a few farthings."116 In Baldric's version, Urban did not use the term "martyrdom" when promising the crusaders a celestial reward and an entry into paradise, but did use it when instructing how the crusade should be conducted and also when giving the examples of other early Christian heroes."' Robert of Rheims, who viewed the crusade as a martyrium, had the pope transfer those willing to take the cross into living sacrifices."8 The initial canon of the Council of Clermont may have spoken only of the remission of penance, not of forgiveness of sins. But for the majority, C. Erdmann writes, "The First Crusade brought forth the notion that the forgiveness of sins was the special portion of those who died on the campaign. Furthermore, death on a crusade was regarded as martyrdom or at least as an assured entry into paradise.""9 Relying on the Chronicle of Montecassino, H. E. Mayer also mentions this novelty of the eleventh century, "for otherwise," he writes, "there would have been no need to stress [in the Chronicle of Montecassino] that the crusaders went off confident of the promised reward."120 The following crusader song well demonstrates this popular misinterpretation of crusade propaganda: Whoever proceeds thither, 114.

During Anselm's first visit to England, in 1079, Lanfranc, the abbot of Bec, and the archbishop of Canterbury, presented Anselm with the case of Archbishop Elphege to illustrate the disturbing trend of popular canonization of saints and martyrs.'24 To Lanfranc's dismay, 121.

One of the strongest advocates of the message of self-sacrifice among the officials of the Church was none other than Pope Gregory VII himself. In a message reminiscent of the language of Pope John VIII, Pope Leo IV, and Pope Leo IX (Migne, Patrologia Latina, vol. 126, col. 816), Gregory asked Countess Matilda of Tuscany to assist him in his efforts on behalf of the Eastern Church. "Do all that you can to give your counsel, and still more your help, to your Creator; for if, as some say, it is a noble thing to die for our country, it is a far more noble and a truly praiseworthy thing to give our corruptible flesh for Christ, who is life eternal." Gregory himself was ready not only to call for a crusade, but also to participate in it with the same enthusiastic energy he required from others. "As for me, furnished with such sisterly aid I would most gladly cross the sea, if need be to lay down my life for Christ with you whom I always desire should cleave to me in the heavenly country." H. E. J. Cowdrey, The Epistolae Vagantes of Pope Gregory VII (Oxford, 1972), pp. 13, 29. Other statements of the same kind are found in Migne, Patrologia Latina, vol. 148, col. 329.

The doubtful Lanfranc chose among many examples the case of the nobleman and archbishop Elphege, which disturbed Lanfranc the most, for the masses "number [Elphege] not only among the saints but also among the martyrs, though they confess that he was slain for refusing to ransom himself' from his captors. Being aware that in order to collect the large ransom demanded he would have to strip his vassals of their possessions, the would-be martyr "chose rather to lose his life than keep it on such conditions."

Southern (London, 1962).</page><page sequence="40">40 SHMUEL SHEPKARU Anselm approved the popular martyrological canonization of Elphege and "counted him among the martyrs, since he is truly recorded to have borne death willingly for so high and righteous a cause. ... what matters it whether a man die for righteousness or for truth?" After Anselm convinced Lanfranc that Elphege should be considered a martyr, Lanfranc made sure that the martyr's name would be remembered and praised, "read or sung in God's Church.""25 In France, even an advocate of martyrdom like Guibert of Nogent echoed concerns and complaints similar to those of Lanfranc in a lengthy report on the problem of popular canonization of saints and martyrs and the worship of their relics throughout Christendom. As Guibert indicates, almost every town and district adopted saints or martyrs and erected shrines to preserve the alleged martyrs' relics, despite the Church's opposition to the swelling trend. 126 Like the Hebrew sources, Eadmer's and Guibert's reports reveal the same popular trend of transforming victims of violence into celebrated martyrs. An eleventh-century version of St. Boniface's biography indicates that style and imagery constituted additional shared motifs.127 The biographer recounts Boniface's final speech and encounter with the pagans on the banks of the Boorne River in 754. The following account is strikingly similar to the martyrological depictions found in the Hebrew Chronicles of the First Crusade. "This now is that very day we have long dreamed of. That moment offreedom we have yearned for is right here. So be heroic in the Lord and suffer this royal grace of his will gladly. Keep your trust in him and he will set your souls free." Then he turned to the priests and deacons and other clerics standing beside him, God sworn men all of them, and spoke to them like a father: "My hero brothers, be bold of heart. Have no terror of these slayers of the body, for they have no power to kill the soul, which lives forever. Take cheer in the Lord and fix the anchor of your hope in God, because in another instant he 125. Ibid., lib. I, c. v, s. xlii. 126. Only in 1170 was the canonization of saints and martyrs reserved solely to the Church. The endeavors of Guibert and other Church officials to correct the situation were in vain, for in many cases the emotional populace refused to yield to "logic" or to Church policy.

Do not surrender yourselves to the doomed love of this life. Snare not your heart with the base and hollow blandishments the heathen do. But submit courageously to this brief instant of death so that you may reign with Christ forever." While he was lovingly urging his disciples on to the martyr's crown with these heartening words, suddenly the raging storm of pagans overwhelmed them with swords and every sort of weapon, and stained the bodies of the saints with the blood of a happy death. 128 The reported yearning for death, the desire to do God's will, the instant transition from death to life, the everlasting rewards in heaven, the crowns and the seats among the saints, the emphasis on martyrs' blood, and the martyrs' "happy" end are central motifs in Willibald's biography. The very same motifs magnify and dignify the heroes and heroines of the Hebrew sources. The identical fundamentals made it possible for the Ashkenazic minority to cope with its secular life in a religious context. Such popular fundamentals compelled Ashkenazic Jews to turn victims of violence into holy martyrs (sacrifices, korbanot) who would be admired in the synagogues in the same way that the Christian martyrs (in Urban's words, recta oblatio, i.e., a right kind of sacrifice)129 were in the churches. The Ashkenazi Jews could not remain oblivious to the concept of heavenly reward in a milieu that made such a concept the ultimate validation of religious triumph. To offer the Jewish victims less than the transcendental rewards that were circulating in the Latin West would not only have deprived the dead of what was viewed as the ultimate victory, but would also have marked an acknowledgment by the living of a final religious defeat. The authors of the Hebrew chronicles of the First Crusade would have none of it. 128.

The year 1096 thus consti- tutes a critical turning point in the evolution of this relationship. The Hebrew chronicles of the First Crusade unite martyrdom and celestial reward, and, for the first time, provide a clear picture of the world that awaited martyrs. In the Greco-Roman period, the martyrs' concern was to avoid transgres- sion and keep the social and religious structure intact. Voluntary death was intended to benefit the nation, collectively. Second and Fourth Maccabees seem to provide the only exceptions. We have, however, enough syntactical and conceptual reason to see the rewards in Fourth Maccabees as a late interpolation, possibly by Christian writers or as a result of external influence. In any event, one cannot ignore the following crucial point: these depictions of martyrological recompense-and this is especially true in regard to heavenly rewards-did not penetrate the ensuing rabbinic literature. If the rabbis did use Fourth Maccabees, then they either had before them a version innocent of these rewards or else they deliberately omitted them. What the Greco-Roman and rabbinic sources clearly shared is the pre- sentation of voluntary death as the victims' last resort; one, in fact, that they often tried to avoid. The Talmud asked Jews in believe in resurrection in the world to come as part of the Jewish tenet. The Talmud views resurrection as a standard stage that follows upon life, regardless of the nature of life. Thus it is not surprising to find the notion of resurrection or the world to come in the accounts of the 400 youths and of Teradyon. Moreover, we have seen talmudic rejections of a connection between martyrdom and reward (Men. 29b; Y. Hag. 2:1; A.Z. 17b; Kid. 39b; and also in the midrash in Bet ha-Midrash 2:64-72). In any case, details of the heavenly existence of martyrs were not provided in the martyrological stories. At best, the world to come was described as a community of talmudic scholars and the inevitable outcome of the eschatological drama. We have continued to see the association of martyrs with the nation's benefits until the eve of the First Crusade. 130. For example, J. B. Russell, A History of Heaven (Princeton, 1997), p. 55; Droge and Tabor, Noble Death, p. 75.</page><page sequence="43">FROM AFTER DEATH TO AFTERLIFE 43 Thereafter, the Ashkenazi theology of individual martyrological rewards, which indicates a growing awareness of the self in Ashkenazic society, took off. Instead of resurrection, its innovative metaphysical doctrine now concentrated on heaven, where the entire Jewish community continued to exist as a social unit. The upper world is a bustling locality, replete not only with scholars and rabbis, but also with children running in the chambers of God, young men and women getting engaged and married, and new converts equally enjoying the metaphysical community.131' In contrast to the tumultuous reality of the medieval world, life in heaven is pleasurable and tranquil, and in it the society of martyrs enjoys a divine meal and the eternal rest of the Sabbath. In parallel to the unblemished human relationships in heaven, there grew the all-important direct relation between each individual and God. Those who dwell in heaven praise and sing to God, while continuing the ritual of human sacrifices before Him. These activities are participated in by all martyrs, past and present, together, yet each martyr has his own stage before God. Each individual, sitting in the circle, focuses on God alone. In return God concentrates on the individual. While the crusaders offered the Jews a utopian European society as a reward for conversion, direct relation with God was the one promise that only martyrdom could guarantee.
