<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY ON MEMORY: PERSONAL AND CULTURAL by BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ, z"I Vera Schwarcz. Bridges Across Broken Time: Chinese and Jewish Cultural Memory. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998. xiii, 232 pp. This unique poetically charged book by Professor Vera Schwarcz might well be described as a passionate hymn to Mnemosyne, the muse of memory. More concretely, it is a meditative reflection of the author's own unique life experience as a Jewish woman born in the city of Cluj in Communist Romania whose family had been deeply involved with all the horrors of the Holocaust. In later years she came to the United States, where she became a highly accomplished scholar in the field of Chinese studies. In 1979, in the period immediately following the frenzy of the Cultural Revolution, she had the opportunity to visit China, and there, in her own words, she "gained first-hand access to the recollections of Chinese intellectuals recovering from the traumas of the Cultural Revolution. I listened and recorded their oral histories with an ear attuned to the dilemma of survivors" (p. x). In China she was in contact both with May 4--aged intellectuals who 'had experienced all the turmoils of twentieth-century China's intellectual and political history since the early twenties as well as with the disenchanted young Red Guards of the cultural revolutionary period who were now vehemently rejecting Chairman Mao's final utopian vision. One of the impressive concrete results of this encounter with Chinese intellectuals both old and young was her impressive book Time for AJS Review 25/1 (2000/2001): 85-96 85</page><page sequence="2">86 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ Telling the Truth Is Running Out: Conversations with Zhang Shenfu,' based on prolonged interview sessions with one of China's most remarkable aged intellectuals, who had been deeply involved with every aspect of Chinese political and intellectual life ever since the May. 4h period. Vera Schwarcz's encounter with China after Mao did not simply affect her understanding of China, for it led to a profound, agonizing reconsideration of her own personal and familial history. One gathers that the official Communist ideology of her early Romanian education, not unlike that in China, inculcated the notion that the horrors of the Holocaust wholly belonged to the reactionary evil past that had now been expunged by the Revolution. While Schwarcz does not assert that the Holocaust and the Cultural Revolution were at all the same, both catastrophes deeply involved the concrete, interpersonal lives of individuals and families. She was now convinced that one's personal life can be made whole only if one recaptures the existential memory of one's personal and intrapersonal life no matter how agonizing and harrowing the memory may be. Thus her Chinese experience awakened within her a burning need to recapture the history of her own family in the face of the inclination of her parents and relatives to pursue the strategy of suppressing and forgetting. One of the most absorbing aspects of this book is the author's account of her unrelenting effort to recover the grim story of her family's past-and to leap over the gap of "broken time." On the whole, I find much to admire in Vera Schwarcz's analysis of the role of personal memory. It is a clinging to memory that does not provide many easy comforts, particularly when one is dealing with Holocausts and Cultural Revolutions. She herself admits that the desire to suppress and forget is highly attractive. Yet she insists that, like Lot's wife in Akhmatova's poem, to become a full human, everyone must refuse "to become deaf to the grief embedded in the past" (p. 157). Indeed this past of "lived history" may embrace unspeakable and inconsolable memories. Thus it is interesting to note that in dealing with large monuments or museums, such as Yad Vashem or the Holocaust Museum in Washington, Vera Schwarcz displays a querulous attitude toward this way of remembering the horrors of the past. Such museums tend to assemble large quantities of material artifacts that vividly and yet quite impersonally concretize the horrors of the 1.

While I myself have no fixed view concerning the effectiveness of Holocaust museums, and while I thoroughly agree that given the real difference between the Holocaust and the Cultural Revolution in China "we will probably never have a museum of cultural revolutionary horrors," it is by no means implausible to contend that such museums vividly remind us of the depths of radical evil to which mankind can sink. They provide an admonitory collective "lesson of history." Schwarcz, however, has little patience with the lessons of history. As a child of Holocaust survivors whose personal memory is focused on the tangible human beings she has known, she draws no comfort from the lessons of history (even though traditional Jewish exegesis includes a multitude of collective admonitory lessons of history; e.g., "Remember Amalek!"). The memories to which she clings are the memories of the sufferings of concrete persons for whom the lessons of history can provide no comfort. The memories to which she clings are personal narratives of fragmented human beings whose existential suffering is unique to them. In the end one must simply say that such personal memories do not make one happier but do make one a more fully realized human being. My own deep problem with this book derives not from the author's view of personal memory, albeit a personal memory that is inextricably bound up with "lived history," but from her tendency to fuse together generalizations about personal memory with vast generalizations about collective "cultural" memory. The term "culture" as she uses it subsumes vast stretches of human history embracing nothing less than the entire history of Jewish and Chinese "civilizations" as well as age-long textual traditions within both civilizations. No one can deny the overwhelming importance of the "faculty" of memory in every aspect of human conscious life. Yet precisely because memory is involved in every aspect of human experience (Mnemosyne was the mother muse of all the muses, including the muse of mathematics), it relates to imagination, to intellect, and to all the fallibilities of human life-including self- deception and even conscious collective manipulation. Yet despite the enormous stress on the modalities of personal memory that pervades the book, the preface begins with a sweeping generalization concerning the nature of Jewish and Chinese civilizations that includes both the lived experience of "contemporary" Jewish and Chinese history and the entire collective cultural memory of both reaching baqk to the very beginning. It is her thesis that the "bridge" between the two civilizations is the fact that both share a distinctive and singularly</page><page sequence="4">88 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ "fierce attachment to remembrance" (p. ix). One must hasten to add that as a distinguished sinologist Schwarcz is acutely aware of the profound differences in the natural content of the cultural memory (e.g., the difference between Chinese organicism and Judaic monotheism; p. 7). Before dealing with my deepest problem with Schwarcz's fusion of personal and cultural memory, I must raise some hesitant reservations concerning her use of the term "civilization" and her claim that the Chinese and Jewish civilizations are both more uniquely committed to remembrance than other civilizations. One cannot, of course, legislate the definition of the word "civilization." To my mind, however, it is a modem, vague, yet all-encompassing term that embraces within itself vast stretches of space and time and huge populations. It encompasses not only cultural orientations but also complex material and social technologies, deep class cleavages, political history and political institutions, and even diverse and conflicting textual and non-textual traditions. When Mordecai Kaplan insisted on calling Judaism a civilization rather than a religion, he may have meant to emphasize that Judaism, as an emphatically "this-worldly" religion, or "way of life," had in fact concerned itself with every aspect of what we now call civilization even though he did not maintain that it had itself achieved a mastery--or even claimed to have achieved a mastery-of all those areas of cultural, social, political, and technological life that are now encompassed by the word "civilization." The Moses of the book of Deuteronomy candidly admits that Israelites will inherit the urban centers established by the Canaanites. Solomon is quite prepared to borrow the architectural skills of King Hiram the Phoenician and the military skills of the surrounding civilizations. Medieval Jewish philosophers were prepared to find deep compatibilities with Greek thought, and even the talmudic, halakhic, and midrashic traditions were prepared to incorporate concepts drawn from Greek hermeneutic logic and Greek vocabularies. In stressing the vast difference in scale between a totalizing civilization and a textually based religious tradition carried down through the ages by a unique yet small people, I by no means intend to diminish the importance of the Jewish tradition or its possible affinity to or comparability with various aspects of Chinese civilization. No one would dispute the fact that the history of Christian tradition, with its reliance on its own sacred texts, has played a central role in the evolution of Western civilization. Yet it is also quite clear that one can hardly ignore the vital role of Greco-</page><page sequence="5">ON MEMORY: PERSONAL AND CULTURAL 89 Roman and even early North European cultures in the complex and unstable mix of Western civilization. It seems to me that one of the misleading consequences of Schwarcz's equation between Jewish and Chinese civilizations is an overwhelming tendency on her part to favor what might loosely called the specifically Confucian stream within Chinese thought. While this stream was indeed to become a dominant stream, there were in fact vigorous counter-streams. Wherever she speaks of the Chinese yearning for the distant past, it is always the Confucian past that she invokes. While the tendency to love the ancient may reflect a general Chinese cultural orientation toward the view that mankind had achieved an idyllic harmonious state of affairs in the Chinese past, the fact remains that the Lao-tzu Daoist vision of the past glorified a pre-Confucian "primitivist" past, while Sima Qian, the great historian of the Han, resurrected an enormously more complex and many-sided view of that past. Indeed, we shall find even within textually based traditions later hermeneutic "substreams" that were to provide quite varying visions of the Confucian normative society of the past. Similarly, I find myself inclined to doubt the notion that other "civilizations" have been less concerned with collective memory than either Jewish or Chinese culture. It is, of course, often noted that Indian civilization was singularly bereft of an interest in history, whether history is conceived of as premodern historical chronologies of political events or modern "scientific" history. Yet the fact remains that enormous poetic-narrative epics, such as the Vedas, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata, contain vast reservoirs of what many might regard as mythic memory that were to dominate the entire subsequent development of Indian civilization, while the early history of Islamic civilization, whether factual or mythic, was to shape the entire later development of Islamic civilization. Indeed, Schwarcz herself admits that the Greek historians who first used the word historia were deeply interested in memories of the Greek and non-Greek world of their time, even though the "affective" concerns that led them to explore the memories of the past may have been entirely different from the affective concerns of the Chinese and the Jews. My fundamental problem with the author's account of memory, however, lies in the sharp antithesis-she draws between the affective "existential" memory of living, feeling human individuals and the abstract ideas and "ideologies" that intellectuals and scholars impose upon the history of human memory. Thus the abstract idea of "Revolution" as a Ding-an-sich that she confronted both in Romania and then among the radical students at Stanford University, and her</page><page sequence="6">90 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ subsequent encounter with flesh-and-blood Chinese living individuals, led her to a sharp revulsion against the hypostasized abstraction of "Revolution." More broadly, she now realized that "abstraction itself desiccates the fabric of history" (p. 29). Reason, as conceived of by Descartes (and here she may be right), is the implacable foe of cultural memory of the past, which is laden with doubts and a blurring of the lines between rigorous reason and fuzzy imagination (p. 29). It was while conducting her oral history project in China that Schwarcz "began to move from the history of ideas to a study of the lives of the thinkers themselves," and began to realize the truth of the sharp antithesis drawn by Edward Casey between memory and the Cartesian conception of reason (p. 24). It is true that her main interviewee, Zhang Shen-fu, was anything but the simple embodiment of any specific ideology. In the May 4th period he had become passionately committed to the logical thought of Bertrand Russell. He then became one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Later he came to the conviction that Russell's thought might be reconciled with some of the fundamental principles of Confucian thought. Schwarcz is acutely aware that his traits of character and personality did not necessarily flow from his intellectual commitments. There was a strong vein of narcissism and concern with his own well-being that related to his own intellectual attitudes. Yet if I may invoke for a moment the principle of charity, the fact is that the seeming instability of ideas and the seeming ability to reconcile opposite ideas may simply reveal the instability of the ideas themselves in post-May 4th China. There is an implication in Schwarcz's writings that abstract ideas and ideologies are static Platonic forms. Yet the history of Chinese Communism from its origins to the present indicates that modem secular ideologies are as subject to unexpected change over time as are the textual traditions of the past with their ongoing hermeneutic evolutions. While I do not challenge her analysis of Zhang's personality and character, the fact is that the Zhang Shen-fu who became a Communist in 1920 could hardly have foreseen the later twists and turns of the party line. Nor is there any reason to doubt that, whatever the stability and validity of his ideas, he was deeply committed to them. I feel compelled, therefore, to state that collective human memory is as deeply implicated with ideas, abstractions, and ideologies, and even with reason-not in the Cartesian absolutist sense but in the sense of the discursive reasoning that marks all human communication-as it is with affective personal memory. The ideas may be good or abominable, yet in the past and in the present they continue to shape all our human experiences. As Schwarcz states,</page><page sequence="7">ON MEMORY: PERSONAL AND CULTURAL 91 "people have been killed in the name of ideas" (p. 23). Indeed the entire experience of the Holocaust was based on Hitler's ideas concerning the role of Jews in human history. It seems to me that Schwarcz's tendency to impose the pathos of personal memory on the entire history of Chinese and Jewish culture leads to misleading interpretations of both. On the Chinese side she deals at some length with the famous Tang "Confucian Revivalist" Han Yu, while on the Jewish side she tends to grossly ignore the extent to which memory, even in orthodox-halachic Judaism, was involved with a vast rationalistic (as well as midrashic) hermeneutic effort to apply the oral law to every nook and cranny of daily life. In dealing with Han Yu's Confucianism, she emphasizes the degree to which he lamented the eclectic attitude that the Tang dynasty displayed toward the counter-traditions of Buddhism and "religious" Daoism, even though as a poet he did in fact borrow many tropes from Buddhist thought.2 Indeed, she identifies the non-Confucian strains of Tang dynasty thought with the post- Cartesian modern Western urge to blot out the irrelevant past. In fact, the non- Confucian strains of Tang thought that drew heavily on Buddhist and Daoist thought (both "philosophic" and "religious" Daoism) were themselves based on textual traditions that already had a relatively long hermeneutic history of their own. What is more, a certain anemic version of state Confucianism remained part of the dynastic creed, and the canonized texts continued to be studied. I would submit that Han Yu's dominant passion in attempting to recapture the truths of the classical texts was not nostalgia, sadness, or tearful regrets (although this may also be found in his poetry), but a vigorous faith that the vital and authentic wisdom of the sages could be retrieved from the vacuous commentaries of the centuries between between the Han and Tang dynasties. As a relatively unsentimental bureaucrat painfully aware of the weakness of the mid-Tang emperorship and the central bureaucracy, he truly believed that the wisdom of the ancient sages and the normative political thought of the sages could be restored. His view of the sages was in fact based on a rather tough- minded interpretation of both the wisdom of the sages and the normative political order that they advocated. His account of the sages emphasizes not so much their inner moral perfection as their wisdom as sociopolitical engineers who were able to actualize the enduring normative sociopolitical order of the 2. Charles Hartman, Han Yu and the Tang Searchfor Unity (Princeton University Press, 1986), p. 7.</page><page sequence="8">92 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ Dao. Indeed, he leaned so heavily toward the tougher "Realpolitik" side of the Confucian tradition that he even had words of praise for legalists like Guan Chung and the founder of the Ch'in dynasty who were by no means committed to the memory of the glories of the past.3 In the case of Han Yu, the antithesis between memory and the Chinese version of rationality does not exist. Indeed, I would suggest that this is true even in the case of the Confucius of the Analects, who may have shed tears but fervently believed in the validity of the ideas that lay behind the revelations of the past. As Schwarcz states, he was "one who loves the ancients and seeks to understand their way" (p. 55), an understanding that can only be recaptured by assiduously studying their ideas. When we turn to the Jewish side, we again find that the Jewish attitude toward the relation between memory, textual tradition, and history does not support the antithesis between memory and the kind of rationality we find in the history of ideas. I would first of all urge that the enormous differences in the actual content of Confucian cultural remembrance and Jewish cultural remembrance can hardly be irrelevant.4 The Confucian love of the past was based on the assumption that the ancient sage-kings had in fact actualized the broad principles of an ideal, normative order and that these principles had then been lost and not recovered. In the case of the canonic Hebrew Bible, we find a broad linear account of Jewish history from the patriarchs to the early period of postexilic return to the land of Israel interwoven with all the nonhistorical themes of the canonical texts based on the assumption that redemption--or the ideal human order-will be achieved only if and when the Jewish people fulfills its covenant with God. In fact, it is implied, from the beginning to the very end, that this redemption remained unrealized! It is this emphasis on ultimate redemption in the future that has led to the view that the Jewish view of history was in fact one of the factors behind the modem, "progressive," future-oriented master narrative of history. To be sure, the Jews in Babylon cannot forget their past life or the plea in Lamentations to "renew our days as of old." Despite the grim picture of an unredeemed pre-exile Judea which we find in the first Isaiah and Jeremiah, the humiliated and homesick refugees in Babylon still long for the joys of their homeland, while those among them who cling to the covenant tradition still 3. Ibid., pp. 130-131. 4. Indeed the author herself refers on p. 188 to the "disparate ways of reanimating the old."</page><page sequence="9">ON MEMORY: PERSONAL AND CULTURAL 93 dream of a redemption in the future. In fact, however, we find that even after the return to Judea, the postexilic canonical prophetic and wisdom texts continue to reflect a deep disappointment with the postexilic situation. We now find new views of the promise of redemption involving both the rise of a messianic apocalypticism and the beginnings of a Rabbinic Judaism focused on the written and oral law as providing the main path to redemption. To be sure, memory continues to play a crucial role in this entire development. Yet the bald fact is that while the Confucian love of the past is based on a firm belief that the model of good order had been actualized in the historical past, the canonical books of the Bible, from beginning to end, speak of a covenantal promise of redemption that is yet to be realized. The later rabbinic memory of the history of the past tends to focus not so much on the linear sacred history of the past as on crucial hallowed events and episodes, such as the exodus from Egypt or the revelation of Sinai, and the life experiences of these hallowed episodes and events in fact became the focus of metahistorical and timeless midrashic interpretations, while the festivals and memorial days with which they are often linked became the focus of transtemporal meanings and ritual practices. The revelation of the law on Sinai is, to be sure, a historic event. Yet the law that is revealed (in the rabbinic tradition even the oral law), once revealed, came to embody an ever-present contemporaneity. In a sense it is the entire world of Rabbinic (halakhic) Judaism that preserves memory (whether the memory preserved represents mythic or actual events) rather than the memory that preserves Rabbinic Judaism. As canonical textual traditions, this by no means implies either in the Jewish or the Confucian case that such traditions are static bodies of unreflective changeless custom. In both cases textual traditions give rise to vast and ultimately unending hermeneutic enterprises, enterprises that are very much oriented not to memory but to memory as it relates to present conditions. Rabbinic Judaism aspires through its hermeneutic methods (whether these methods are highly logical or midrashic) to extend the kingdom of God's laws and commands to every aspect of human life. When we relate the category of memory to history rather than to specific textual traditions, one can argue that China's view of the dialectic relations between memory and history is, in a sense, more continuous than that of Rabbinic Judaism during the period of the medieval diaspora. Professor Yosef</page><page sequence="10">94 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ Yerushalmi, in his brilliant study Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory,s dwells on the degree to which the medieval world of Rabbinic Judaism found itself massively indifferent to what might be called contemporary or recent history, whether one speaks of history in terms of medieval chronicles or nineteenth-century "modernm" historicism. While the biblical prophets who spoke of the End of Days in non-apocalyptic terms as a time when the "Torah would go forth from Zion" were deeply concerned not only with the internal history of Jews but also with the rise and fall of surrounding polities and empires, the medieval diaspora paid little attention to the current history of the Islamic and Christian worlds, over which they could exercise no control. The messianic apocalyptic strain of the Second Temple period had not disappeared, but it remained largely neutralized by the tendency to find salvation mainly in the all- embracing metahistorical world of the sacred law. Again, as in the case of the Confucian canonical texts, this contemporaneity of tradition by no means resulted in stasis. It led to a vast hermeneutic enterprise of constant debate among rival interpretations of the texts as they applied to the actualities of an unfolding present. In the words of Moshe Halbertal, "There is an interesting asymmetrical relation between canonization and hermeneutical openness. The more canonized the text, the broader interpretative possibilities it offers."6 In the Chinese case, Han Yu disdainfully rejects what he regards as the lifeless, pedantic Confucian commentaries of the period between Han and Tang, and ardently believes that he can recapture the vital sociopolitical vision of the original texts, which provided a genuine vision of what a true sage is and of the true principles of an ideal ethico-political order. Similarly the medieval rabbinic order may have concentrated on the world of halachah (particularly in northern Europe), yet it did provide an opening to medieval Jewish philosophy, which drew so heavily on Greek thought. Maimonides' synthesis drew its sustenance from both Jewish and Greek canons. There was also the rise of the kabbalistic interpretations and even a tradition that emphasized internal ethical "self- cultivation" and pietism. It is interesting to note, however, that none of these traditions are essentially historical in orientation. They all emphasize what might be called transtemporal truths. Memories of the past are, more often than not, treated in terms of a sustained unilinear narrative as in terms of the midrashic 5. University of Washington Press, 1982. 6. Moshe Halbertal, People of the Book, Canon, Meaning and Authority (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 44.</page><page sequence="11">ON MEMORY: PERSONAL AND CULTURAL 95 emphasis on the transtemporal meanings of specific events. Yerushalmi points to the fact that it is precisely during the period following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain that we find a revival of a sustained interest in recent linear history, which coincides with the revitalization of the messianic-apocalyptic strain of Jewish thought. This leads,in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to a new production of chronicles on recent linear history, suggesting that a new age may be at hand. In the later post-enlightenment period, it was even to lead to an emphasis by non-orthodox Jews on the linear account of Jewish biblical history as a precursor of nineteenth-century ideas of progressive history. Indeed, one can say that it was on the Confucian side that the enterprise of dealing with unilinear recent history of the past remained a constant, vital, and officially sanctioned enterprise from beginning to end. Precisely because the actualization of the good society had taken place during the first three dynasties and never been wholly recaptured, it remained a constant dominant theme not simply because the later official and unofficial historians were "on intimate terms with tears," but because they were genuinely concerned with the question of why and how later dynasties succeeded or failed in following the sacred model of the past. Whether one was dealing with official dynastic or nonofficial histories, while one might have quite different opinions of why certain periods of history could be praised or blamed in terms of their faithfulness to the sacred model, the ongoing, linear narrative of history on both the official and unofficial levels remains a central preoccupation within the Confucian stream of Chinese thought. The upshot of these comparisons is that neither in the Jewish nor the Confucian tradition is collective cultural memory simply to be equated with the affective life of individuals. In both traditions, memory is often inextricably and passionately involved with abstract ideas and visions, with ideologies both good and evil, and even with falsehood and manipulations of memory. None of the above is meant in any way to denigrate the current efforts on both the Jewish and Chinese sides to seek out affinities and comparabilities in Jewish and Chinese culture. There is much to be said about the common this- worldly orientation to human finite life, the role of ritual in family and communal life, and so forth. The abundant available literature on Christianity and Chinese religious thought, based, to be sure, on a much richer historic experience of interaction, provides a fruitful precedent, but it also reflects the unfortunate fact that, despite resistance to Christian missionary movements in China, Chinese views of Judaism have nevertheless been heavily influenced by Christian stereotypes.</page><page sequence="12">96 BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ Finally, it seems to me that there is one affinity between Jewish and Chinese modem history in the twentieth century that remains somewhat muffled in Vera Schwarcz's account, namely, the role not merely of suppression and forgetting but also of a vehemently contemptuous attitude toward the premodern past. While Mao Zedong and even the famous writer Lu Xun may have had affinities with certain isolated aspects of the past, they both regarded it as a bad past, which they rejected in search of a golden future. Indeed, the ideas of both East European and West European Jews as well as of modem Chinese intellectuals often drew on precisely the same Western modem and future- oriented utopias. It is thus eminently possible to compare Ahad Haam to Liang Qi-chao, and Leon Trotsky to Chen Du-xiu, despite the enormous differences in their situations. Despite the questions raised above, Bridges Across Broken Time remains a most highly suggestive, sensitive, and thought-provoking book on issues involving the nature of memory, the meaning of history, and the hermeneutic evolution of textual traditions.
