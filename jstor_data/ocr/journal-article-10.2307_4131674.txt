<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven Weitzman. Surviving Sacrilege: Cultural Persistence in Jewish Antiquity. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005. viii, 188 pp. Steven Weitzman's book focuses on efforts to preserve Jewish cultural and religious traditions in the face of foreign domination during the Second Temple period. The author perceives the foreign rule under which Jews lived during most of the Second Temple period "as the part of reality that is recalcitrant, hard to manage or constrain, indifferent or even hostile to what it is that one is hoping to preserve." Such a situation called for Jews to employ special, elaborate techniques of cultural persistence throughout the Second Temple period in order to mitigate and control outside pressures. The author specifically uses Michel de Certeau's notion of the "arts of the weak"-that is, survival tactics followed by people who do not control their environment in order to preserve their cultural tra- ditions.1 Those tactics include a whole range of methods, such as appeasement and symbiosis, resistance, flight, concealment and deflection, as well as the power of imagination to construct what Weitzman calls "possibilities beyond the evidence of immediate sense perceptions." Jews employed all of them in the face of the overpowering might of foreign rule. The book consists of seven chapters (plus a concluding chapter), each of which addresses the survival techniques used by Jews to persevere during the Second Temple period. The first chapter, "After Babel," explores cultural tech- niques used in the aftermath of the Babylonian exile and subsequent restoration in the Land of Israel under the auspices of the Achaemenid Empire. The author pays special attention to the creation of a symbiotic Jewish-Persian narrative in the Book of Ezra, which set "Persian rule within the framework of Jewish religious tradition" and, at the same time, resituated "Jewish culture within the realm of Persian rule." The author further explores alternative survival narratives. The first narrative of "concealment" focuses on the act of hiding the Ark of the Covenant and other Temple implements and their subsequent recovery in the future. It creates an imagined reality "outside, or underneath, the territory con- trolled by foreign rule, an unseen locale in which the core of the Temple cult can persist impervious to external surveillance and interference." The second narrative 1. Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, trans.

As in Ezra, serving the king and sustaining tradition are utterly compatible in 1 Esdras, but now Jewish involvement becomes more proac- tive. Because of their wisdom, Jews could actively play the game of foreign rule and manipulate it to their advantage. The second chapter, "Maccabean Maneuvers," explores the variety of narra- tives produced around the Hasmonean revolt against Seleucid rule. The author masterfully demonstrates the ambiguity of the Hasmonean stance regarding the Seleucids by contrasting the narratives of 1 and 2 Maccabees. Whereas 1 Macca- bees seeks to establish the legitimacy of the Hasmonean dynasty by emphasizing its charisma and heroics in uncompromising struggle against the Seleucid foe, "a happy ending for 2 Maccabees is not the end of Seleucid rule but a kingdom ready to recognize the Temple's sanctity." This second type of narrative seeks accommo- dation with the Seleucids based on the synthesis of Jewish and Hellenistic prin- ciples, such as the recognition of the status of the Temple as "sacred and inviolable." Such a coexistence of uncompromising and conciliatory cultural nar- ratives generates a need for doublespeak and purposefully ambiguous story lines, such as that of Judith. The literary plot of Judith mirrors the peculiar dialectics between violent zeal and subservient accommodation that were characteristic of the Hasmonean mentality in general. The remaining chapters investigate a variety of techniques used by Jews in their interactions with Rome. The chapter on "Friends in High Places" studies how Philo used the Roman rhetoric of friendship to secure the imperial patronage of traditional Jewish practices. Weitzman observes that "within the Roman imagin- ation that Philo was addressing, friendship was marked by like-mindedness but it also required difference, the true friend proving his affection by only partially imitating his companion." Philo portrays the Jew following Jewish tradition as the true friend of Romans, a friend "who proves his love by being almost the same but not quite." Such an approach allowed Philo to legitimize Jewish distinc- tiveness by placing it securely within the Roman system of values. The next chapter, "Optical Elusions," addresses ways in which Jews tried to situate the Temple on the Roman cultural map and protect the Temple from being violated by Roman curiosity. On one hand, Jewish authors presented the Temple as an artistic jewel of the Mediterranean world that deserved preservation by Rome because of its aesthetic value; on the other hand, they used the techniques of ekphrasis and anti-ekphrasis to draw outsiders' attention to religiously neutral parts of the Temple complex by emphasizing their artistic qualities and, at the same time, directing attention away from the religiously significant Holy of Holies. The chapter on "Flights of Fancy" analyzes attempts to imagine the "true" Temple that is both distinct from the physical Temple edifice in Jerusalem and shares in its sanctity. By doing so, Jews tried to reassert control over the Temple even while it remained vulnerable to Roman interference and desecration. Weitzman examines the Copper Scroll from Qumran as a possible development of the "hidden ark" story discussed in Chapter 1. He also discusses replicas of the Temple (the Temple of Onias, the community of Qumran, and Heavenly Jerusalem) that put the holiness of the Temple safely out of Rome's reach. 438</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The following chapter, "Conjuring Power," describes the methods used by Jews to summon supernatural interference in order to offset the military superiority of Rome. Weitzman analyzes practices such as miracle working, military instruc- tions for ensuring divine or angelic presence on the battlefield, and the interpret- ation of omens against a broader background of modem peasant insurrections led by millennial prophets on one hand and the Roman practice of manipulating divine interference in battle on the other. He demonstrates how the rhetoric of Josephus's War served to counter the expectations generated by such practices. Finally, the chapter on "Playing Dead" explores the rhetoric of the "suicidal feint" occasionally used by Josephus. Weitzman puts it within a broader context of profoundly ambiguous attitudes toward voluntary death in Flavian literature. Josephus both praises the Jewish resolution to remain steadfast to the point of death and displays unease about acts of actual suicide. In doing so, he stresses the performa- tive value of one's readiness to die for one's ideals without, however, endorsing the actual suicide. This kind of rhetoric allowed Josephus to portray Jews in accordance with Roman canons of noble behavior and to avoid the rebellious connotations associ- ated with the act of suicide during the Flavian era. Weitzman also contrasts Josephus's rhetoric of the suicidal feint with the earlier Jewish notion of voluntary death as a redemptive act resulting in the ultimate victory of the Jews over their oppressors. Weitzman's book is a highly sophisticated and thought-provoking work. The author repeatedly demonstrates a full command of the primary and secondary sources, and his analyses of the techniques used by Jews to mitigate and control outside pressure is persuasive. To my mind, however, his analysis raises a theor- etical question about whether "cultural survival" and "cultural persistence" are indeed valid categories to describe the Jewish experience in the Second Temple period. The book sets out to explore "the efforts of early Jews to preserve their religious traditions" in the face of overwhelming external pressure. But I believe it demonstrates how the tradition itself was constantly being reshaped, transformed, and amplified by the multiple religious and cultural identities of the Jewish people in the Second Temple era. Ezra, Philo, Josephus, and others were as much part of the imperial cultures that dominated Jews as they were part of the Jewish tradition. They participated in both, and they constantly inter- preted them in light of one another. A great deal of the "survival techniques" explored by Weitzman might reflect Jewish attempts to create an integrated self on the basis of multiple cultural identities. In fact, the very notion of "ancestral tradition" as a supreme cultural and religious value might have emerged from an attempt to place Judaism within the Greco-Roman system of values.2 Indeed, Weitzman himself identifies a narrative of cultural persistence as "one in which Jews poach resources from the other for use in sustaining their own culture." I would merely suggest strengthening this observation by fine-tuning the language of kulturkampf These remarks in no way diminish the high quality of Weitzman's 2.
