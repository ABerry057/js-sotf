New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. x, 310 pp. Salamone Rossi (c. 1570-c. 1630) is a fascinating but enigmatic figure. The man who epitomizes the Jewish participation in the Italian Renaissance left only 152</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews a few meager footprints in history. We know of Rossi only from his thirteen sur- viving publications and from the appearance of his name in the Mantuan archives. He was all but forgotten until 1876, when Samuel Naumbourg, Chief Cantor of Paris, published a modem edition of fifty-two of Rossi's compositions. For yet an- other hundred years Rossi would remain for the most part hidden in the shadows. Not until the past four decades has Rossi's music been extensively and seriously published, performed, recorded, and studied. Rossi was a man who moved freely between two worlds. Because of his enor- mous talent, he was hired by the Gonzaga family to serve as violinist and com- poser for the ducal court. Vincenzo Gonzaga even exempted Rossi from wearing the yellow Jew-badge, and granted him the privilege of free passage between the ghetto and the ducal court. Rossi was an avant garde musician. He was the first composer to publish concerted madrigals (1600-five years before Monteverdi). He was the first composer to publish trio sonatas (1607-ten years before Mari- ni). He was the only composer in Mantua to publish both instrumental and vocal music. His madrigals are based on texts by the ultra-modem mannerist poets. But Rossi was equally at home in the narrower world of the Jewish commu- nity. He was active in the Jewish theater of Mantua as composer and performer. At the suggestion of Rabbi Leone da Modena, Rossi composed polyphonic settings of selected texts from the synagogue liturgy. Published in 1622/23, Ha-ShirimAsh- er LiShlomo, the first anthology of choral music for the synagogue, constituted a radical break with tradition. Bringing the styles of the madrigal, the balletto, and the church motet into the synagogue was a controversial move-one that incurred both approbation and censure. In an attempt to deflect the criticism, Rossi pref- aced his publication with a lengthy responsum by Rabbi da Modena, justifying this radical practice. But Rossi's music is not merely a historical curiosity, it's great art! Why has it taken so long for Rossi to be accorded his due? For several centuries after Rossi's death, as the Jews of Italy retreated into their ghettos, there was no context for his synagogue polyphony. Furthermore, in the non-Jewish world, for most of the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries the styles of the pre-classical period were consid- ered passe. But in the twentieth century there has been a growing understanding of and enthusiasm for "early music." Harrnn's recent monograph, the first full-length study of this innovative mu- sician, is the culmination of nearly two decades of fastidious research and analy- sis.1 Like a Sherlock Holmes, the author has pored over the sparse clues and im- mersed himself in his subject's environment. He expresses himself with authority in fields ranging from choreography, music, and poetry to Jewish history and prac- tice. Harran is a meticulous researcher: He has counted every measure in Rossi's oeuvre, sung every verse of Rossi's strophic canzonets, and analyzed every chord and contrapuntal device. Harran is careful about how he weighs his evidence. He will often suggest, 1.

For example, the author states that it is a "reasonable possibility" that Rossi's sacred music might have been per- formed in the setting of the Jewish confraternities (p. 217), and that Rossi "might have even tried out some of the songs in Sara [Copio]'s house" (p. 34). In re- sponse to a surprising document from 1645 in which Rabbi Nathaniel Trabotto asserts that his late wife had sung Rossi's setting of the Kedushah, Harrin care- fully posits, "But what if these sacred songs were not performed in prayer ser- vices?" (p. 24). Harrin points out that the title of Rossi's collection of synagogue music, Ha- Shirim Asher LiShlomo, is more than just a play on words. He reminds us of the well-established rabbinical convention of choosing titles which included the au- thor's name in a Biblical citation, such as Isaac Arama's Akedat Yitzhak or Judah Moscato's Nefutsot Yehudah. Harrin deduces that by identifying himself with this convention, Rossi hoped to balance his modernity with a grounding in tradition. It is interesting to note the evolution in Harrin's attitude towards Rossi's innovations in synagogue music. In 1987 he wrote that Rossi and Modena " ... wished to dispense with the conventions of Jewish prayer melody, replacing them by a music based on the best features of the Italian art music tradition."2 But in the present monograph he admits, "The polyphonic song ... via the 'Songs of Solomon,' supplemented [the synagogue chant]-notice that I did not say 're- placed it', for Rossi's intention was not to reform, but to expand the synagogue repertory..." (p. 254). Given the exhaustive nature of this study, it seems odd to discover any lacu- nae. And yet Harrin misses a few connections between Rossi's synagogue com- positions and church music practice. In his analysis of Rossi's use of triple meter (p. 226) he fails to mention that the triplum is often used in church motets to des- ignate rejoicing and to refer to the trinity. Thus the shift to the quicker dance-like triple time in Psalm 128 underscores thejoyous text, "your sons will be olive shoots around your table."3 In Adon Olam the triplum appears twice, in both cases in- spired by a quasi "trinity" of divine attributes: "And He was, and He is, and He shall be in glory" and "And He is my God, and my living Redeemer, and a Rock for my suffering in a day of distress." Harrin is fully cognizant of Rossi's attraction to the balletto. It is curious that he misses the fact that the Kaddish a5 is modeled on this popular Renaissance dance form. And while calling attention to Rossi's unusually dark scoring of Psalm 137 (Al Naharot Bavel), he seems unaware that Rossi is merely following the accept- ed practice for composing church lamentations.4 But these are but a few tiny lapses in a work of careful and thorough schol- arship. This is a fascinating study of a pre-modern Jew coping with the dialectic that we normally associate with modernity: preserving Jewish identity in a non- 2.
