<plain_text><page sequence="1">Efraim Sicher. Jews in Russian Literature after the October Revolution: Writers and Artists between Hope and Apostasy. Cambridge Studies in Russian Literature. Cambridge: University Press, 1995. xxiv, 280 pp. Today there is no shortage of scholarship on Jews in Russian literature, sometimes focusing on the Jew as character, sometimes on the Jew as author. What much of this scholarship shows us is that by the 1917 Russian Revo- lution, there was no shortage of Jews in Russian literature. Despite ongoing discrimination and emigration, this small nation formed a disproportionately large percentage of the intellectuals, artists, and politicians in the late Russian and then Soviet empire. Trotsky was not alone. What the most recent spate of books on Russian-Jewish writers claims</page><page sequence="2">280 BOOK REVIEWS is that these figures remained Jewish even after conversion to Christianity, in some cases, or partial to complete assimilation into the atheist Soviet state. Indeed, one mark of their Jewishness is an intense struggle with their tradition and cultural identity, which the authors of these studies often find to be defining tensions in their texts. Russian-Jewish writers remain "God-wrestlers" even in apostasy. Sicher's study is no exception. After a preface and two introductory chapters ("Burning Embers" and "Modernist Responses: The Jewish Je- sus"), Sicher devotes four chapters to Isaac Babel, Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak, and Ilia Ehrenburg, respectively. His epilogue, "Hope Betrayed," centers on Vasily Grossman, a figure somewhat less known in the West. Sicher already has a well-deserved reputation as a Babel expert, and has published some of his ideas on Mandelstam as well. His innovation in this study is the creative juxtaposition of the ambiguous status of his subjects (Russian and Jewish as cultural opposites, Jew and writer as synonyms for the subversive Other) and their role as witness to or accommodator with the Russian Revolution. Sicher differentiates his study from others by focusing precisely on the Revolution: "I argue that the Revolution and the events leading up to 1917 in art and in the social history of the Jews caused a complete break with the old Russian-Jewish literature. These are individual portraits of the artistic self in conflict with time and history" (p. xx). Just as these writers could not shake their inner sense of Jewishness, so, too, could they never forget the jarring effects of the Revolution (or of Stalinism, in the cases of Ehrenburg and Grossman). For Russian-Jewish writers of the twentieth century, Sicher points to the combined dislocation of three moments in history: the pogroms, modernism, and the Revolution. All of these writers faced an "accommodation with the Revolution and with themselves"; each of them presents a "literary response to modernity and revolution" (p. xix). Despite this unique focus, Jews in Russian Literature after the October Revolution ultimately develops a standard binary model; Sicher explores each given writer's conflicted attempts to "break out" of a stifling sense of Jewish otherness into the "expanse of Russianness" (p. 14). (A provocative introductory chapter on Christian symbolism in modernist Jewish writers and painters might be better off as a separate study, although the author does refer back to the Jewish/Christian opposition in some of the chapters along with the Jewish/Russian conflict.) In the case of Babel's dichotomous dilemma, Sicher refers to an "irreconcilable contradiction between the violent Revolution and humane Judaism" (p. 102) and a "consciously open-ended dialectic of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 281 contradictions" (p. 111). In Mandelstam, Sicher tells us, the "narrator must resolve the problem of the boundary" (p. 114). Interestingly, Sicher sees a reversal in Pasternak, whose Doctor Zhivago concerns "the spiritual and more humane values identified with the Russian nation. To Pasternak's way of thinking, these were values antithetical to any attachment to Judaism" (p. 151). Ehrenburg trod a different path through the binary contradictions of the Soviet-Jewish writer: "the expletion of the personal self" (p. 171): "in each of my books I 'dissociated' myself from myself" (p. 192). What Sicher hints at is the complex relationship between Jewry and Judaism for all these writers in a country where the two are linguistically differentiated (evrei and iudei) but culturally confused. To what extent did these writers understand Jewishness as a national identity? As a religious tradition? As a culture? Could they abandon one identity while retaining the other? Did Pasternak become "Russian" by his conversion to Orthodoxy? Did Mandelstam's "aesthetic concept of 'Judaism' " (p. 129) infringe upon his desire to enter Russian cultural history? How did Ehrenburg's claim to "the status of Russian writer through the performance of texts in order to slant ethnic biography and literary ontogenesis" (p. 175) relate to his largely Christianized conceptions of Jewishness and his "prohibited love for Russia" (p. 187)? I close this review of what is a strong and provocative contribution to the literature on Russian-Jewish writers with a small reservation and a question, the latter for myself as well as Sicher. To my mind, Sicher mars many of his insightful statements with too much jargon: "erasure and exorcism," "psychic damage," "double-voicing"; but this is mainly a question of taste. More troubling, I sometimes wonder whether the persistence of Jewish themes or hidden references in writers ambivalent about their Jewishness has a more pragmatic meaning than many would avow. As a scholar of Russian- Jewish literature, I write of the tortured relationship between Jewishness and Russianness not only to express my own torn soul, as it were. Cynically speaking, does not at least some of my motivation stem from a desire to exploit an expertise, develop a "minority advantage"? Could this not be the case for Babel and the others as well? A positive answer need not diminish our fascination with their masterpieces, but it can help us avoid unnecessary psychologizing when we discuss them.
