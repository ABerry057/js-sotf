Here now is the full scholarly edition, expanding the author's findings into an incomparable reference work. "Wonderfully rich and learned...Kugel's enormous undertaking is likely to be seen as a milestone in the long critical history of Bible studies, that is, of the approach to the Bible as both a human document and a living one" -Richard Bernstein, NewYork Times $75.00 cloth Moses the Egyptian The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism JAN ASSMANN "Elegantly argued, impressively docu- mented, and written in eloquent English, Moses the Egyptian offers challenging new findings on the early history of monotheism, and a new reading of the place of Egypt in modern Western cul- ture-and it puts both into the larger context of a theory of cultural memory." -Anthony Grafton, New Republic $18.95 paper The Exegetical Imagination On Jewish Thought and Theology MICHAEL FISHBANE Exegesis-interpretation and explana- tion of sacred texts-is the quint- essence of rabbinic thought In this lucid and often poetic book, Michael Fishbane discusses the nature and rationale of this interpretative process in a series of studies on ancient Jewish specula- tive theology.
