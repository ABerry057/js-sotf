<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. Po-chia Hsia. The Myth of Ritual Murder: Jews and Magic in Reforma- tion Germany. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988. 248 pp. German Jewry suffered a series of blood libels in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Then, after about 1540, the libel declined in Germany. In The Myth of Ritual Murder, Hsia weaves an extraordinary variety of sources-archival records, ballads, theological treatises, plays, legal codes, extorted confessions-into vivid, detailed reconstructions of five German blood libel cases between 1470 and 1570, a series of stories full of pain but also hope. This is an outstanding work of research, reconstruction, and interpretation, and Hsia's conclusions are important for an understanding of both medieval and modern anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism. Hsia places the ritual murder accusations within both a religious and a political context. In the context of religion, Hsia sees blood libels as acts of Christian piety; he sees their rise as part of the general rise of lay urban piety in the late Middle Ages. Jewish "blood magic" was a threat to the Christian community; the Jews' supposed murder of an innocent boy repeated the Crucifixion. By punishing the Jews, the community avenged the Crucifixion, and reensured its salvation from the powers of evil. From this point of view, the crucial factor in the libel's decline was the Protestant Reformation.

But Hsia also sees ritual murder accusations as power struggles between imperial and local German authorities. The German Habsburgs, unlike their Spanish cousins, were conspicuously supportive of the Jews. Ritual murder cases became tests of the limits of imperial power. Viewed in this way, the decline of the libel may be linked to Habsburg success in imposing standard legal procedures, especially limits on the use of torture, and the "revolutionary" (p. 193) extension of the Roman principle of equity to include the Jews. Late medieval Germany, Hsia argues, had a "unified discourse," in which theological works confirmed rumors, and ballads confirmed laws. Thus confirmed, the blood libel became "knowledge." But in the sixteenth century, "popular" and "elite" cultures increasingly took separate paths. Reformation theology and imperial law books both had new "discourses." The blood libel ceased to be religious or legal "knowledge"; it became a mere legend. One of the book's weaknesses is its very sparse attention to Jewish sources and scholarship. For example, Hsia mistakenly bases his discussion of Jewish perceptions of the blood libel ("in the Jewish discourse on ritual murder, word magic was used to ward off blood magic") on the modern for- gery, Nifla'ot ha-Maharal. How did Jews perceive the blood libel? In the memoirs of Josel of Rosheim, a Jew active in fighting the blood libel, whose own relatives were among its victims, we find that the blood libel is never called a "blood" libel at all. It is called the "bastard libel," 'alilat mamzer. The Jews believed that they were blamed when Christian parents murdered their own bastard children. Hsia touches on the question of infanticide. Andreas Osiander, a Reformer who argued that the blood libel was a myth, suggested that "per- haps . . . negligent parents were responsible: the children could have fallen on knives" (p. 142). Children do not, of course, "fall on knives"; but the murder of children was a repressed, unspeakable reality. The myth of ritual murder mediates a conflict between an idealized image of children and the fact of extreme brutality toward them. "Concomitant with the decline of ritual murder cases in 1540," Hsia discovers (p. 155), "cases of child murders began to be publicized in Germany."</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 295 Hsia also points out that as the blood libel declined, witch trials increased. Women, not Jews, were now seen as the representatives of the demonic in the community. Jewish accounts of the blood libel also assume that often it was purely a cynical pretext. The Jews would naturally denigrate their antagonists' reli- giosity; but I think that Hsia errs equally in underestimating the role that active deceit and sheer cruelty played in ritual murder accusations. Hsia's book suggests a liberal interpretation of Reformation history. The sixteenth-century German Jews and their Lutheran and Habsburg allies were successful in their lobbying efforts against myth and prejudice. But the ambiguous heritage of German liberalism requires the author to look beyond his story's optimistic conclusion. The memory of the Holocaust lies heavy over any study of German anti-Semitism. Hsia cautiously evokes that memory in the book's first pages, bringing an example of the deep-seated anti-Semitism of even enlightened eighteenth-century Germans. The Reformation, Hsia writes, did not "eradicate the long tradition of Christian anti-Judaism .... [Rather] Lutheran pastors concentrated their attack ... on Jewish injury to the Christian moral economy. The image of the Jewish moneylender eventually replaced that of the Jewish magician" (pp. 147-148). Hsia also notices the perpetuation of anti-Jewish myths, including the blood libel, by the Counter-Reformation church and in German folk culture. We should also notice the split between Habsburg legal and Lutheran religious reforms. Lutheranism at an early stage disengaged itself from the movement for political reform. Hsia's story has two heroes; that these two heroes were at cross-purposes, were indeed enemies, suggests a weakness crucial for later history.
