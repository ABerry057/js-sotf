<plain_text><page sequence="1">Haim Hazan. Simulated Dreams: Israeli Youth and Virtual Zionism. New York: Berghahn Books, 2001. xi, 166 pp. Zionism-the Israeli national constitutive myth that powerfully shapes that country's politics, society, and culture-is currently under attack from Israeli so- cial scientists. An academic-political stream known as post-Zionism is reexamin- ing and questioning nearly all of Israeli society's "sacred cows" as it exposes the coercive, silencing, and exclusionary force of the Zionist master narrative and its contribution to intense conflicts and cultural and social distortions. This is the con- text in which the book at hand should be read. It critically examines the Zionist ethos from a cultural anthropological perspective, and explores the cultural medi- ums through which the Zionist narrative passes as it undergoes a process of frag- mentation through simulation. The book is based on the author's rereading of his own five very different ethnographic studies conducted during the last decade. It includes a short prologue, an introduction and a conclusion, as well as five chapters, each of which is based on research conducted in a different social-cultural arena. The first chapter cen- ters on the attempts by residents of a deprived community to cleanse it of its stig- matic label; the second deals with the delegations of youngsters sent to traverse Poland and visit its Holocaust sites; and the third looks at a satirical program pro- duced and aired during the first Gulf War. The fourth chapter examines the rebel- lion of Tel Aviv youths as represented in a popular movie, and the fifth discusses 383</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the commemoration of Yitzhak Rabin, showing how youths staked a claim in the national collective memory. The somewhat shaky rationale given for uniting these separate research pro- jects lies in the concept of "simulation," borrowed from Baudriallard, and which the author extends "to denote text that plays with representation" (p. 5). The book demonstrates how the Zionist myth is deconstructed in different cultural arenas in which simulation plays with and disguises reality and the myths therein. It con- tends that Zionism as a constitutive myth does not appear as a culturally coherent story because it is "shredded into pieces of cultural idioms, buzz words, ironical slogans and recreational venues" (p. 101). The central idea is that simulations of the myth enable it to be embedded within the day-to-day cultural tapestry without being eradicated, thus allowing for its digestion by society at large. The idea of simulation or "simulacrum" as such is not new in cultural analysis. Its importance here lies in Hazan's contention that the focus on fragments of myths and dreams enables us to better understand how myths reach and are absorbed by people in their everyday life, and how myths are deconstructed through the manufacturing of simulations. However, there is a danger that the sweeping use Hazan makes of the con- cept of simulation will blur the distinction between reality and myth. At the same time, we can ask whether the dominant mode by which Zionism reaches various audiences in Israel today is through simulation. I would argue that Zionism, na- tionalism, and Jewishness are still represented and communicated as total desti- nations, and not, as Hazan claims, as "tourist-like nostalgic excursions" (p. 101). Further, it would have been worth asking under what conditions the simulation deconstructs, or, alternatively, strengthens the Zionist ethos in different collec- tives or cultural arenas. It would seem that the book over-generalizes with regard to the complex relationship between reality, ethos, and simulation in different contexts. As the book's subtitle indicates, Hazan studies the literal and metaphorical ties between the Zionist myth and its simulation through observations of youth and youthfulness in Israel. This contrasts with Hazan's important cultural anthropo- logical work on old age, to which he devoted many years, but shows that Hazan continues to give center stage to "voices from the margins," with the aim of un- derstanding cultural and social phenomena. Like others who have studied youth in Israel-by and large structural-func- tionalist sociologists who made a significant contribution to the field in Israel and outside it'--Hazan is right in assuming that as a nationalist society, Israel is high- ly sensitive to its children and is almost compulsively preoccupied with their com- mitment and willingness to take part in the national struggle. He is also correct to presume that images and expressions of youth and youthfulness that are rooted in Zionism have been adopted by other age groups in Israel. Research on youth in Israel dwindled in the 1980s, following the strength- 1. S. N.

The field of the anthropology of youth came to be, and has remained, almost neglected in Israel, despite several important works on the subject.2 In this sense, Hazan's use of cultural anthropological theory in ex- plaining the affinity between the Zionist myth and youth culture is most welcome. However, Hazan does not analytically conjoin the anthropology of youth and cul- tural anthropology. I argue that such a union is essential for understanding youth as a cultural category, the cultural practices of youth, and the ways in which young people produce and negotiate cultural forms. This problem seems to stem from the fact that the five research projects in the book were not originally intended to study youth and youth cultures, but were made into such ex post facto. Sometimes it ap- pears that the author has not sufficiently considered whether youth constitutes the context for the research, or its subject. In other words, it is not quite clear whether youth serves as an arena in which to demonstrate how simulations deconstruct the Zionist ethos, or whether Hazan is showing us how Zionism in a global, postmod- ern age shapes Israeli youths. There is a further troublesome point: Hazan describes Israeli youth as post- modern, cosmopolitan, and postcolonial, yet does not explain what this means. Which youth is he talking about? The youths in the book have neither voice nor face; they remain abstract and generalized. However, as in any other society, the space of young people in Israel is not monolithic, and is occupied by various iden- tities with interrelationships, not free from conflict, based on ethnicity, gender, re- ligion, and class. One could assume that in such a divided space, the Zionist dream is sim- ulated in different ways. Given that research on the rifts and interrelations be- tween different groups of youths could teach us much about society in general, this point is lacking from the book. This volume is concise and condensed, and full of the latest "post" anthropological jargon and concepts. Because of con- ceptual meandering, repetitions of the same idea in different phrasings, and an assumed prior knowledge of Israeli society, it is not a very user-friendly book. At least some of the burden of reading could have been lightened by more rig- orous editing. The book is thus suited to an anthropological or more widely so- cial-scientific audience, and not for a popular one. Reading the introduction- the most abstract part of the volume-at the end would render Hazan's theoret- ical arguments and his critical, insightful observations of Israeli (Jewish) soci- ety much clearer.
