Avi Sagi and Zvi Zohar have, in recent years, made great contributions to Jewish studies, in particular the study of halakhah. In their many individual pub- lications they have mined the often ignored halakhic literature in order to offer per- spectives in a variety of areas. They have also jointly published a number of works, including a very learned study on conversion (Giyur ve-Zehut Yehudit). In their latest work, Circles of Jewish Identity: A Study in Halakhic Literature, they follow the path set out in their previous work by asking what the assumptions and con- clusions of halakhic literature tell us about issues of Jewish identity, such as how to define it; whether it is immutable; and, if not immutable, whether one's Jewish identity can be removed against one's will. Their discussion proceeds from the rel- evant talmudic texts, through the medieval period, up until the most recent respon- sa. This chronological approach is helpful in charting the development of concepts. Just as modern man struggles with the issue of identity, with some putting the focus on ethnicity and others on religion, the authors show how the halakhists also had to confront this issue. Although the halakhists obviously never formulat- ed the problem in the way moderns do, many of their concerns were similar, and, from their halakhic arguments, the criteria they used, and their conclusions, it is possible to understand their perspectives. Sagi and Zohar focus on one halakhic issue that has had many repercussions throughout Jewish history: the Sabbath violator. As is well known, according to the Talmud a Sabbath violator is placed on an equal footing with a idolator. But is this to be taken literally? In other words, does this mean that a Sabbath violator cannot marry a Jewish woman or that he can be charged interest on a loan? If the answer is yes, then Jewish identity is clearly a function of religion only. If no, then despite what the Talmud writes, there is also an ethnic component, which is not so easily severed. To provide especially clear illustrations of this issue, the authors discuss in great detail the status of wine handled by a Sabbath violator. If a Sabbath violator is really no different from an idolator, then his wine is undrinkable. As the authors show, there are many halakhists, even in modern times, who believe this. There are some who go even further, and very shocking is the view of Rabbi Hayyim Shloush, the current chief rabbi of Netanya. According to Shloush, one is not per- mitted to save the life of a Sabbath violator on the Sabbath, adding that "perhaps 120</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews today we don't have to kill them" (my emphasis). The authors quote a number of other halakhists who, while not as extreme as this, are also explicit that even a con- temporary Sabbath violator is, in certain respects, no different from an idolator. This position is the basis for the special hashgahot on wine stating that it is pro- duced by Sabbath-observant Jews. The authors quote authorities that come down on the other side of the ques- tion and put the focus on the ethnic element of Judaism. Without downplaying the importance of the Sabbath or the seriousness of its violation, some halakhists ar- gue that the negative consequences recorded in earlier literature concerning one who violates the Sabbath refer only to the brazen violator. However, one who does not know any better and who shows in various ways that despite his Sabbath vio- lation he still wishes to be connected to the Jewish people is not removed from his ethnic connection. In focusing on the issue of identity the authors are also able to illuminate the concept of deviance in the eyes of the halakhists. In some Jewish societies, com- munal identity formation required an almost complete removal of the Sabbath vi- olator from the Jewish collective. In others, such as nineteenth-century Germany, where Sabbath violation was widespread, such a tactic was thought to be counter- productive. Therefore, halakhists such as Jacob Ettlinger, Esriel Hildesheimer, and David Zvi Hoffmann found ways to justify keeping the Sabbath violator in the Jew- ish collective. The authors are careful to stress that their study should not be compared with sociological studies, since theirs is an inner-halakhic study. They are not speaking of how society judged the Sabbath violator. They are speaking of the rabbis'judg- ments, which might be very different from the judgements of their congregants. It is only in the last chapter that the authors attempt to connect the rabbinic opinions with various theoretical models of Jewish society. According to the authors, how the halakhist relates to these models will determine in large measure whether Sab- bath violation is thought to remove someone from the Jewish religious or ethnic collective. It is only in this chapter that the authors focus on issues discussed in modern sociology. Those who appreciate this type of analysis will find the dis- cussion helpful, but it is not essential to the major themes of the book. By way of criticism, one must express surprise that the authors, in discussing medieval views, include a passage from Z. B. Auerbach's edition of the Eshkol, supposedly authored by R. Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne. There is a scholarly consensus that this edition is a forgery. I can do no better than cite the words of a reviewer from these very pages: "Auerbach's Eshkol appears as a clear forgery, in- corporating arguments found in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and even eighteenth- century writings ... [The work] should not be used for historical purposes."' 1. Haym Soloveitchik, review of Eric Zimmer, Olam ke-Minhago Noheg, AJS Review 23 (1998), pp. 227-228. Israel Moshe Ta-Shema, perhaps not knowing about other accusations of forgery leveled against Auerbach, believes that the Eshkol is a fourteenth-century forgery that Auerbach innocently pub- lished. See Rabbi Zerahyah ha-Levi Ba'al ha-Maor u- Venei Hugo (Jerusalem, 1992), pp. 40-4 1, and my Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy (London, 1999), p. 77 n. 8. The manuscript that Auer- bach claimed to have used has never been found. For a rare example of a halakhist who refuses to grant Auerbach's edition of the Eshkol any validity, see Isaac Ratsaby, Olat Yitzhak (Bnei Brak, 1989), p. 410. 121</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews A more serious criticism of their work is that Sagi and Zohar do not always distinguish between the categories of codes, where "pure" halakhah is recorded, and responsa, where in the rough and tumble of the real world the pure halakhah cannot always be applied. Thus, it is well known that codifiers, including Mai- monides, wrote responsa that contradict what appears in their codes. The kelalim literature deals with this issue in great detail. This is relevant for an example discussed on pp. 70-72, dealing with the opinions of Joseph Karo and Moses Isserles regarding the status of wine touched by a Sabbath violator. In the Shulhan 'Arukh both Karo and Isserles agree that one may not drink such wine. The authors raise an apparent contradiction between this strict opinion and Isserles' well-known justification for the widespread practice of consuming Gentile wine. The authors claim that Isserles' lenient opinion in this case is a recognition of the changes in the religious world of Christians compared to the idolators of years past. The authors then ask why Isserles did not also adopt a lenient approach to wine handled by Sabbath violators, and they suggest a soci- ological explanation. Here, however, the authors are comparing apples and oranges. Isserles' le- nient opinion with regard to Gentile wine is found in a responsum. He makes it very clear that his role in the responsum is not to record the law for posterity, as he does in the Shulhan 'Arukh, but rather to find some justification, however ten- uous, for a widespread apparent violation of halakhah. Not surprisingly, in the Shulhan Arukh, Isserles does not offer this leniency, a point not noted by the au- thors. Had Sabbath violators been prevalent, and had the general population been accustomed to make use of wine handled by them, there is no reason to assume that in a responsum on this issue Isserles would not also have attempted to justify the practice, These caveats aside, Sagi and Zohar have given us an important and read- able book which provides conceptual order to the vast halakhic literature. Its sig- nificance is not simply in collecting and explaining all of the major texts con- cerning an important issue of Jewish religious history, but in showing how the debates between the rabbis reflect different views of the nature of Jewish identity.
