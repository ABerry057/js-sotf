AN ASPECT OF SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENCAL JEWS IN THE MIDDLE AGES By JOSEPH SHATZMILLER University of Toronto It is impossible to discuss the social life or the organization of the Jewish community in the Middle Ages without noting the fact that the synagogue was its center. In many cases the synagogue was the only building owned by the community as such, the only institution that actually was at everyone's disposal. It did not always happen to be a special kind of building con- structed or dedicated to the worship of God: sometimes one of the city's houses, or an apartment, or a room, would serve as a synagogue. Thus we hear that in the town of Manosque in Southern France-the location of our episodes-there was in the year 1311 a synagogue located at what had formerly been the house of Macip, one of the community's members.' The synagogue was primarily a "lesser sanctuary," a place where the Jewish congregation was united with its Creator. It was only natural that it 1. Some aspects of the life of the Manosque Jewish community in the Middle Ages are dis- cussed in my book, Recherches sur la communaute'juive de Manosque au Moyen Age, 1241-1329 (Paris and The Hague, 1973). On the house previously belonging to Macip and by 1311 a syna- gogue, see ibid., p. 34: "Omnes iudei de Manuasca habitatores, congregati simul in domo que condam fuit Macipi iudei et nunc est (ebreuorum) ubi faciunt scolas." For similar cases, see e.g., I. A. Agus, Responsa of the Tosaphists (New York, 1954), p. 175 (no. 91); D. F. Bofarull y Sens, Los judios en el territorio de Barcelona (Barcelona, 1910), p. 57 (no. 33). 227</page><page sequence="2">228 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER would also be a place where the members of the "holy community" managed their communal affairs: levying taxation, enacting regulations and contracts, proclaiming excommunication and ostracizing individuals and groups. It was there, as a matter of course, that the Jewish community ex- pressed its full solidarity. On the other hand, it was also a place where oc- casionally social tension would burst its bounds. Then, as today, quarrels and conflicts would find expression there; grudges, hate, envy and rivalry were displayed. This was of course not necessarily connected with prayer or worship; the very fact that the rivals were in a large crowd aroused them, almost against their own will, to display their emotions in public. Such an event occurred in the synagogue of Manosque at the end of August 1292. A Jewish woman, Blanca, abused Comprada, the wife of Bonjudas the Painter, and called her ugly names. Our text says: "malo modo et iniuriose dixit eidem in scolis coram pluribus 'Calla, Calla, Malvaysa,' quia non deberes loqui in loco in quo essent bone domine nec in quo ego sum."2 In the town of Manosque we hear of four such cases (in addition to the above mentioned) in the period between 1311 and 13383-only four trials out of many hundreds in which the community members were involved at this time. Nevertheless, such numbers were surely sufficient to cause worry to the spiritual and moral leadership of the times, as we shall see below. They were not ready to accept such occurrences as part of the "facts of life" and were at pains to limit if not eliminate them. In the collection of regula- tions attributed to R. Jacob Tam (ca.1100-1171) we find that he was not prepared to bear such goings-on in silence; he even endeavored to stem the abuse by special legislation distinguishing between someone who beat his fellow in an ordinary place and someone who did it at the synagogue. Thus we read in one of the regulations attributed to him: "And our Rabbi Tam [Rabbenu Tam] ordained twenty-five dinars for beating, but fifty dinars for an assault at the synagogue,"4 i.e., a double fine. Subsequent versions of 2. "[She] said to her rudely and insultingly in the synagogue in the presence of many: Quiet, quiet, you evil one, you should not talk in a place where respectable ladies are, nor where I am." See next note for reference. 3. The court registers of Manosque in the Middle Ages are located at present in the departmental archives of Bouches-du-Rh6ne in Marseilles, in the series of the Order of Malta, classed 56H.

Baer, Die Juden im christlichen Spanien (Berlin, 1929), 1:952-53.</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENIAL JEWS 229 these regulations make clear that this enactment of Rabbenu Tam was not accepted by later generations. The wording of one of the versions suggests "that it was not the way of the great scholars of France to discriminate between the assailant outside the synagogue and the assailant within the synagogue, but they would empower the court to make the sentence lighter or severer according to the situation of the assailant and the assaulted as they saw fit."5 Still, either version we take shows the problem of the "as- sailant at the synagogue" as a situation demanding the attention of contem- poraries. Such occurrences did not necessarily remain an internal Jewish matter. The gentile authorities sometimes took an interest in what was happening at the synagogue for various and sundry reasons: political-legal, monetary and possibly even ethical. In any case this was so in Manosque. In the court records of the municipal authorities we find, as noted, the four trial protocols which are the result of this interest; four cases illustrate the type of incidents and conflicts that the legislation of the community referred to. The place, the dates and the names of those involved in the incidents are known to us in all cases. I state this in order to emphasize that our documentation is of a limited and local nature and that we should not expect from it more than it can give. It is impossible to draw general conclusions regarding the behavior patterns of the Jewish community, nor can we gain a wider perspective of its tensions and quarrels; this would be too ambitious a goal. Instead, it sometimes reveals to us tiny details of incidents as though seen through a magnifying glass. The information which those documents yield us is not always of uni- form value. Only in two of the four cases do we hear the background of the quarrel, the subject of the discord or the details of events. One of these two cases even records the most minor details of the happenings, of the relationships and feelings on both sides. In the two other cases, which we shall present first, our knowledge of events is much more limited: neither the indictment drafted by the court, nor the interrogation of the witnesses which the document records further on, satisfies our curiosity. On April 16, 13296, the court accused four Jews of participating "last Sunday," i.e., on April 9, in a fight that commenced at their synagogue, and 5. Finkelstein, p. 194. 6. See 56H979, 19r-v (April 4, 1329) and see Appendix A.</page><page sequence="4">230 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER continued outside it, with combatants making use not only of their hands and fists, but also a varied stock of weapons: sticks and stones, swords and spears. The court fails to mention anything about the background of this in- cident, nor does the witnesses' investigation inform us of anything relevant. All they attempt to claim is that nothing occurred within the synagogue, but, on the contrary, outside of it. One of the accused, named Petit, asked the rival-so claim the witnesses-to step outside the synagogue into the street. We learn from here, incidentally, that the tension and the strife ap- parently reached its height in the synagogue itself. The document does not tell us anything more than that, and its importance lies in the manner and style the court used in the wording of the indictment-something we shall take up in the last part of this article. About twenty-eight years later, on July 26, 13117 the court made a similar charge against a group of Jews: that they struck one another at the synagogue. This time it was clear that a controversy of important social and religious character was at the base of the squabble. On July 23, i.e., on the Ninth of Ab, Jews had assembled to offer prayer according to their custom (ut est moris). Here the document adds a sentence which contains the clue to the whole turmoil: "Since permission from the bailiff of Manosque was ob- tained to say it [the prayer] until tomorrow afternoon" (Cum licentiam illud dicendi obtinuissent a domino baiulo Manuasce usque cras ad prandium). The document does not say anything more about the background. The Ninth of Ab, the day of fasting and mourning on which the Jews lament the destruc- tion of the Temple, is one of the most important days of the Jewish calendar. Were the Jews in need of any special permission to commemorate it? What was the reason for the discord-the getting of the permit itself or the time limit granted? The material in our possession does not answer these ques- tions. As a matter of principle, the Jewish community needed no kind of permit to hold prayers. Freedom of worship was one of the main founda- tions of the privileges that the Jews had been granted in all European countries at that time, and it was taken for granted. Nevertheless, we find here and there some information on interference of the authorities in syn- agogue worship. These rare enough incidents were undoubtedly caused, at least on some occasions, by the members of the Jewish community 7. See 56H964, O1v-1Ir (July 26, 1311) and see Appendix B. There is some question of a paleographic nature about the July 26 date. The number 25 is clear, written in Roman numerals XXV, and there is definitely a symbol following it. In my opinion, this is a "I," so that we could read XXVI. But this is uncertain; and if we have instead an erasure, the date would be the twenty-fifth, in which case the commotion took place on the day before the Ninth of Ab.</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENQAL JEWS 231 themselves. Rabbi Meir (Maharam) of Rothenburg (ca. 1215-1293) in the second half of the thirteenth century was called upon to deal with a con- troversy which arose in a community (apparently in Germany) with regard to the appointment of a cantor.8 The problem was that a minority of the community's members opposed the appointment of the cantor. The duke, i.e., the secular authority, intervened in the dispute and requested the non- conformists to comply and accept the view of the majority. He must have meant well; Maharam, however, resolutely protested against the very in- tervention of Christian authority into the affair: "It was not proper to ap- point a cantor of the All-Merciful in their manner." Additionally, Maharam relates an incident that had occurred in Cologne in the first half of the thirteenth century in the time of "'Avi ha-'Ezri," i.e., Eliezer ben Joel ha- Levi of Bonn (Ravyah, 1140-1225). The bishop intervened in the appoint- ment of a cantor, and this time also for the benefit of a particular candidate worthy of the office. However, this Jew himself refused the appointment because of the bishop's intervention, although it was for his benefit. Ac- cording to Maharam, the man remarked: "My law does not allow receiving from you the service of our Creator." Jews did not always behave like that cantor of Cologne. In the Taqqanot Shum (regulations of Speyer-Worms-Mainz), from the beginning of the thirteenth century as well, we read the following: "And whoever appoints a cantor or a roller of the Holy Scroll by gentile authority shall be completely excommunicated."' This shows that there indeed were cases when Jews wanted to "receive the service of their Creator" from the rulers and even succeeded in doing so. In our case of Manosque in 1311, the intervention was evidently not connected to the appointment of the cantor, but to the holding of the prayers. Surely it is not a coincidence that the case occurred on the Ninth of Ab, even though the circumstances remain obscure. Some of the congregants were ready to accept this invitation of the bailiff. Others, however, and especially the sons of the late Bonusnomen, i.e., the descen- dants of one of the most important families in the community, were staunchly opposed. The honor and the independence of the community had certainly been put to the test. One of the accused turned to a Jew named Bonetus who held (together with his son Astrugonus who had been beaten 8. See Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg, Responsa, ed. Cremona, 1557-8, no. 190 (ed. Prague, 1608, no. 137), as quoted by Benzion Dinur, Yisra'el ba-Golah (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1971), 2.5:473. 9. See Finkelstein, p. 227, also quoted by Dinur, p. 493.</page><page sequence="6">232 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER by his rivals) that it was necessary to say the prayers even under such cir- cumstances; he told him that if he were to do this he would remove him with disgrace from the altar ("quod illum vilipendendo removeret ab altari eorum"). It must then have been a basic split that perhaps reflected dif- ferences in temperament and approach with regard to the relations between the Jews and the authorities. It seems that it is not only to us (considering the condition of our document) that this intervention seems strange. The members of the community too, or at least part of them, looked upon this as something out of the ordinary and were afraid of establishing a precedent. Let us proceed to the last two incidents for which we have more details. The first of them took place at the end of September 1324.10 This time the in- vestigations carried out by the court provide detailed evidence regarding the cause of the strife. We find the town's Jewry assembled at the synagogue at midnight, or at the second hour of the first night-watch, engaged in the tiq- qun bapot (the Midnight Prayer). September 25 coincided that year with the Ten Days of Penitence between the New Year and the Day of Atonement. The prayer was being recited by a boy or youngster named Caracausonus, and his prayer was interfered with by another Jew named Leonetus. The questioning of witnesses clarifies that this Leonetus was in charge of and responsible for the funerary needs of the community. His interference in the recitation of the prayer had to do with his special duty: the community members had to inter a Jew from the adjacent town of Forcalquier-the Jews did not have their own cemetery there' '-and Leonetus who had brought along with him the needed equipment urged the community members to finish their prayer promptly so that they could proceed to that task. He incidentally also expressed his objection to the very fact that a young man was offering the prayer. According to Leonetus' own evidence in court he spoke as follows: "non est bonum nec licitum quod infantes dicant modo mesterium [sic], ymo debet eum dicere persona antiqua et quod bene sciat misterium." This remark on a matter of principle, not less than the dis- turbance itself, aroused, as we would guess, the wrath of Botinus, the pray- ing boy's father. He rose and exclaimed: "Cursed is he who prevents my son from finishing his prayer" (maledictus sit qui disturbatfilium meum quod non complerat officium suum), or, in the version of another witness: "Maledictus sit cui displicet oratio filii mei." 10. See 56H978, 5r-v (Sept. 26, 1324) and see Appendix C. 11. On this see my book (n. 1 above), p. 134: "Cum nullum Forchalquerio haberent... iudei cimiterium." The document dates from 1306.</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENQAL JEWS 233 During the struggle that followed between the two (and this particularly is what the court was trying to verify) the instruments brought by Leonetus had been used. Yet, in spite of the strong language with which the court worded its description of this fight, it was clearly of limited scope. The background is essentially private and the number of participants is limited. However, the protocol introduces us into the inner life of the synagogue and its atmosphere during the services, besides giving us in some detail an exam- ple of what could have caused debate and discord on other occasions. The fourth and last incident occurred at the end of September 1338, on the Day of Atonement, the most sacred day in the Jewish calendar,'2 which fell that year on a Thursday (September 24). No wonder, then, that this time we have the most complete documentation, including a very detailed record of events and a description of the background. Seven people had been charged by the court and each of them (with one exception) had been sum- moned to give evidence and tell his version of what happened. To this more evidence had been added, which was given by nine persons including two of the three sindici of the community. Not all the information given by the witnesses was of uniform value: some had been present at the synagogue during the fight and were able to tell what they had seen and heard. Others even knew the background that provoked the incident. The trial began on the day following the Day of Atonement but lasted for a long time: after more than eight months elapsed, on June 16, 1339, the court started to gather evidence from a new list of witnesses in addition to those summoned on the day following the incident. The verdict in this case is, as it happens, unknown. A story of a crisis which broke out on the Day of Atonement in a Provenqal community is also told by Kalonymos ben Kalonymos in his book 'Even Bob.an, which he completed in December 1322, or at the very beginning of 1323.'3 The incident he described occurred presumably in his own town, Arles, some fifteen years at least before our incident in Manos- 12. See 56H984, 32v-35v (Sept. 25, 1338) and see Appendix D. 13. See Kalonymos ben Kalonymos, 'Even Boban, ed. A. M. Habermann (Tel Aviv, 1956), p. 122: "I finished the letter in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, the world being five thou- sand eighty-three years old." The month of Tebeth began that year on December 10, 1322, and ended on January 7, 1323. The translation of this passage was done by my friend Dr. A. A. Greenbaum, and I take this opportunity to thank him and his wife Miriam for their help in translating this article.</page><page sequence="8">234 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER que. Kalonymos tells his story in the context of his criticism of contem- porary Jewish Provenqal society, while describing in detail the activity of that society on every holiday of the Jewish calendar. Here is his description of the Day of Atonement almost in its entirety: And on the Day of Atonement ... each family goes its own way to cause strife and dissension. The small of mind and impudent of spirit look upon themselves as "lieutenants and deputies" [important persons]. They then wink their eyes, gnash their teeth, and whisper in each other's ear-whereupon the people are split in two. Someone will raise himself on a pedestal and claim the place of honor. Another will boast that he will be the one to pray. One will say: "If my tongue will not dry and my step will not falter, among my relatives will I find holiness, and so-and-so, my good relative, will atone for me." Another will say against the destroyers, or the seducers and arch-sinners: "No, Arioch the chief butcher-let us appoint him head of our company." In the meantime anger waxes great, discord increases, peace goes away and quiet disappears, sacrifice stops and prayer ends. It happened that a quarrel broke out in the Yoyer [morning] service, and some holy implements were broken, like a vessel. In the Musaf [additional] service joy was absent, in the Minhah [afternoon] prayer happiness passed, in the Ne'ilah [final] prayer false accusations abounded, and in the 'Arvit [evening] service trembling and convulsions seized them.'4 These words of Kalonymos were not uttered without foundation and certainly were not meant only to annoy or upset the reader. There always ex- ists a particular relationship (and a very problematic one indeed) between reality and its description by the satirically minded critic. We have here a literary text which projects and emphasizes certain features of reality and submerges others for the sake of artistic presefitation. Yet it seems possible to gain from it at least some data having a historical foundation. First of all, the event itself did take place. Kalonymos himself testifies that it happened and he was presumably present, for he knows a great deal more than the mere fact that there had been a quarrel. Our document from Manosque shows that incidents of such a kind were indeed within the realm of pos- sibility at that time and in that place. Second, the background of the dispute appears to be dissension between families: "Among my relatives will I find holiness and so-and-so, my good relative, will atone for me." In the third place, as a result of this, the service had been disturbed. Kalonymos 14. Ibid., pp. 28-29.</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENQAL JEWS 235 probably, for the sake of literary-artistic effect, shows the prayer affected in all of its stages. We are permitted to assume that on this sacred day, the ser- vice had been harmed at least in part. Kalonymos also mentions that "some holy implements had been broken," and it is not out of the question that we have here an echo of an actual physical outbreak. Now, the supposition that these data have a base in reality is strengthened because the incident in Manosque includes them all and it can, therefore, serve as a concrete il- lustration for Kalonymos' literary creation. The incident took place at noon. The morning prayer had been led by a man whose name is not mentioned. After him, Isaac of Alamania had been called upon to say the Musaf prayer-secundum misterium-as our docu- ment states. Alamania is the name of a small village not far from Manosque. Isaac' and the members of his family must have been the only Jews in that little village and apparently used to spend the holidays in Manosque. Isaac Alamania's being invited to conduct the prayers aroused the opposition and the wrath of another family of the community, the Baherias. They vociferously claimed that by law and custom only someone acceptable to each and every member of the community could on that particular day take the cantor's stand. Since a conflict between Isaac and Jacob of Baherias had still not been resolved, they claimed that Isaac was not worthy (dignus) of being the cantor. There was actually a strong basis for the protest of the Baherias family.'6 In the Jewish communities of Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there was a debate on the basic question as to whether the leader of prayers should be appointed by unanimous agreement, or whether a majority or a decisive majority of community members would suffice for his appointment. In the middle of the fourteenth century surely no place observed the rule at- tributed to Rabbi Simha ben Samuel of Speyer (end of twelfth and begin- ning of thirteenth centuries) according to which "a single individual could hinder cantorship," for, according to Rabbi Simha's view, a cantor is not to be selected other than "by a united association."'' R. Meir of Rothenburg looked upon this as so stringent a rule that it could not be observed. In his words: "I do not differ with him [with R. Simha] when there are many who refuse even though they are a minority, say, three or four people. However, 15. This Isaac de Alamania is, in all likelihood, identical with the "YiSbaq Me'ir de Alamania" whose signature appears on one of the deeds (of the year 1326) that were copied into the Responsa of the Sages of Provence, ed. Abraham Schreiber (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 323. 16. For documents on this matter see Dinur, p. 473, and the following two notes. 17. See Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, 'Or Zaru'a, pt. 1, no. 114, as quoted by Dinur, p. 473.</page><page sequence="10">236 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER how can a single person make an objection?"'" Hence, it was sufficient- again, according to Maharam, writing elsewhere-that if the cantor was ac- ceptable to a majority of his fellows although not necessarily all, then "he must not be prevented from conducting prayers on account of one com- munity member who hates him." This rule does not concern the New Year and the Day of Atonement. On the Days of Awe the cantor had to have the favor of each individual member of the community-everyone, and not just the majority! R. Meir of Rothenburg says this further on in the selection we have just quoted: "He must not be prevented from conducting prayers if perchance one of the community members hates him, except for the New Year and the Day of Atonement, when it is customary to appoint only a cantor accepted by the whole congregation." This rule, as would seem from the words of the Baherias family, was obviously also observed in Provence at that time. In Manosque, the community, the sindici, appointed cantors for the High Holidays,'9 in all likelihood to prevent situations where a can- tor would not be accepted by everyone. Thus, when Isaac of Alamania came up to the pulpit, wrapped himself in a lallit (prayer shawl) and got ready to read the Torah, two of the Baherias, Abraham and his son Jacob, began to shout and protest. The father, Abraham, said something like this: "Do not pray, for today, on such a holi- day, he who does not have the favor of everyone, does not have the right to say the prayer. You are not in good standing with us so you are not entitled to pray" (Non dicatis misterium, quoniam hodie in tantofesto non debet quis dicere misterium qui non sit bene cum aliis. Vos non bene estis nobiscum et non estis dignus dicere misterium). Jacob of Baherias called to Isaac in Hebrew (in ebraico), as one of the witnesses tells us, and prohibited him under pain of excommunication (sub pena excommunicationis) from proceeding with the prayer; he probably meant the regulation concerning such a case, the transgressor of which incurs the ban. Jacob himself would testify in court that he had spoken to Isaac as follows: "Don't go up! Get down! For you cannot conduct the prayer, as you know well" (Non ascendatis! Dimitatis! Quoniam vos non debetis dicere misterium, quia nullus qui non habet bonum cor et bonam voluntatem alteri non debet dicere, sicut vos bene scitis). Some of the congregants supported the Baherias; others, however, 18. See Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg, Responsa, ed. Cremona, no. 21 as cited by Dinur, p. 473. 19. See the testimony of Abramonus de Besanduno in our trial: "Dixit fore verum quod cum inter ipsos judeos sit ordinatum quod nullus judeus sit ausus dicere in magnis eorum jestis misterium nisi ille qui ordinatur ad dicendum ipsum per sindicos ipsorum judeorum."</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENQAL JEWS 237 demanded that Isaac be allowed to carry on with the prayer. Isaac himself was not deterred and began reading the Torah. Abraham of Baherias and later on Colunbonus, Jacob's son-in-law (thus we see three generations of the family), hurried to the seat of the rabbi, Magister Vitalis, and asked him to intervene. Abraham insistently pleaded with him not to tolerate the mat- ter and reminded him that Isaac of Alamania was a stranger (straneus) and not a member of the community. The rabbi's reply was a call for peace and conciliation to let things go as they were.20 When the young Colunbonus also rushed to Magister Vitalis he passed on his way between the Holy Ark and a member of the community named Leonetus Davit who was holding a Torah Scroll; Leonetus and others regarded what was happening as sacrilege. Leonetus, although holding the Torah Scroll, still tried to stop the young man. Some witnesses add that he also dealt him a hard blow. Magister Bonafosius ran to Colunbonus' rescue and attempted at the same time to save the Scroll in Leonetus' arms from falling. Now Colunbonus was also struck by Abraham, the brother of Isaac of Alamania. In the melee the lower part of the cloth enwrapping the Torah was apparently torn. Possibly this is not all that happened, but the witnesses fail to add anything more. Doubtlessly, they are trying to lessen the extent of the sacrilege. One of them testifies, in any case, that loud noises of a commotion (rumorem magnum) had been heard. We are informed that there were two synagogues in town, one for the well-to-do and another for the poor, which were probably very close to one another, or perhaps two floors of one and the same building. The noise and shouts were also heard in the second syn- agogue, the one of the poor. All this eventually made Isaac desist. After he read the Torah he did not proceed to the prayer itself. We are told that Magister Vitalis acceded to the request of the congregation and conducted the remaining service of that day himself. Some at least were not taken by surprise by this crisis. For them the drama was much greater, for it had been anticipated. It was clear even before the holiday that the invitation of Isaac of Alamania to serve as cantor would arouse protest and dissension. Several days before the Day of Atone- 20. Rabbi Vitalis conversed with Abraham in ProvenCal. The notary wrote down his words in our text verbatim, as quoted in Abraham's testimony. There is difficulty in reading one word of what the rabbi said, and consequently the whole is hard to understand. One can read in the text the sentence: "Laysas li far si fa sa folia (el) la si bona," which should mean: "Let him do it, if he did the foolish thing [verb] if it is good." The difficulty consists in reading the word "el" or "ol."</page><page sequence="12">238 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER ment the community leaders (the sindici) invited Isaac and proposed that he lead the prayer on the holiday. He refused on the grounds that there was an unresolved conflict between him and Jacob of Baherias. In view of this, the leaders of the community turned to another person and made an agreement with him. That man, whose name our texts have not preserved, conducted the morning prayer on that day but for some reason was not able to con- tinue. Some of the congregants then appealed to the rabbi, Magister Vitalis, to carry on with the prayer, but the latter refused because he was exhausted. At the last moment, there being no other choice, the offer was again made to Isaac. The community chief tried on the spur of the moment to make peace between him and Jacob, but without success. For some reason, Isaac decided to take the cantor's post, perhaps in the heat of anger. The Baherias then rose up and that which the community had feared happened. Thus the tumult and scandal came about. The interest and concern of the authorities in these incidents are primari- ly discernible by inspecting the indictments drawn up by the court on those occasions. Sometimes, as mentioned above, this is the only part of interest in the documents under study. The investigation of witnesses and the questions posed to them is not less significant in some cases. The authorities appear here primarily as the guardians of public order. This order being disturbed anywhere-in our case at the synagogue-the authorities have to restore it and punish the guilty. This is, after all, their duty! As in the hundreds of other cases that the court registers of Manosque record, there appears also in our four cases a formula expressing the basic attitude of the authorities: "cum sit mali exempli et correctione digna id- circo dicta curia contra predictos et omnes alias culpabiles de predictus ad inquirendum processit." Of course, the authorities are competent to intervene on such occasions even if it be an internal Jewish affair occurring in a synagogue. The institu- tion or the building are not "extraterritorial" in this context. The court needs no sanction from the community and on no occasion requests such. Once, in a trial of 1324 connected with the Midnight Prayer, an internal regulation issued by the Manosque Jewish community is mentioned, and it is emphasized that the Jews violated it: "Venientes contra penam omnibus judeis et contra cuilibet impositam XXV librarum, quod nullus ipsum of- ficium impediat quodo modo." They did not rely on the Jewish regulation in</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVENQAL JEWS 239 order to justify their intervention. It makes better sense to assume that it was the fine of twenty-five pounds mentioned in the regulation that beguiled the court and on its account the regulation itself was mentioned. The authorities had a clear financial stake in such trials, and this is an added point in clarifying their interest in such goings-on. The income from court-imposed fines was an important source of revenue for each local "seigneur," as it was for the count of Provence himself. The long lists of fines-tens of thousands in our period-which we find in the registers of the County of Provence (today in series "B" in the Bouches-du-Rh6ne Archives) can serve as evidence of this interest. The Order of Saint John, the master of the city of Manosque, was no different. In our four cases it is clear that the court levied fines in at least three of them: in the trial of 1324 we come across the word "collecta" at the end of the pages which shows that the fine was collected from the accused. Two other cases also have the sums of money charged for fines. In the trial of 1329, where four people had been accused, we learn that each of them had been fined 25 solidi ("collecta est in quemlibet in XXV solidis"), i.e., the court's income had been the con- siderable sum of 100 solidi (five pounds). In the trial of 1311, where three brothers had been charged with aggressive behavior, we hear that the three of them had been fined as follows: Isaac, five tournois of silver; Salvonus and Sullamonus, ten solidi each. We have, however, no information about fines in the 1338 trial. On top of the page, the clerk noted "pendeat et refor- matur," but there is no doubt that the court expected considerable fines on that occasion. The indictment was always worded in very harsh language. This is true not only for the documents which concern us here but also for many others in the registers of Manosque. There is a notable difference between the text of the indictment and its description of events and between the actual facts as they emerge in the investigations of the witnesses and the accused. The reason is clear: while the accused and their friends are at pains to reduce the weight of the charges as much as possible, the court does the reverse in order to justify the penalties to be imposed.21 This difference is also seen in our cases. In the trial of 1329, in which the community regulation is mentioned, all the accused testify that the quarrel occurred outside the synagogue, and by no means inside it, as the court sought to claim. In the trial of 1338 the court wanted to know-this is shown repeatedly in the investigation of the 21.

Most of the witnesses stated, upon being questioned by the court, that they knew nothing about this. The one witness who made a partial admission les- sened its effect by emphasizing that only a very small piece (aliquantum)- and no more-of the Scroll cover had been torn, in spite of the reports about a great commotion at the synagogue while this happened. The court, as we have noted, outlined in this case as in all others a much darker picture. While one must not forget that this was a Christian court hostile to the ritual of a rival religion, we can conclude that the judges tried to play down this element. We fail to find any expression defaming the Jewish religion or the synagogue on this occasion, although the social and religious vocabulary of that period had its terminology of humiliation and contempt for the "Synagogue of Satan." After the Disputation of Paris in 1240, the attitude of contempt toward Judaism was even given an "intellectual" stamp of ap- proval, and in 1284 the court at Manosque termed Judaism "credulitas."22 We do not find any of this in our texts; on the contrary, here we come across a recognition of divine worship (officium divinum) held at a synagogue. We thus, for example, find the following style in the 1338 trial: "predicti non advertentes quam grave est divinum officium disturbare-venientes temere contra precepta legis et cannonicas sanctiones." And in the trial of 1329 the indictment is worded as follows: "Non deferentes eorum ecclesie seu sinagoge quam apud eos ecclesia habent." Without assumptions of this sort it was difficult for the court to in- tervene so forcefully in these incidents since the alternative was to treat them simply as blows exchanged during ordinary social gatherings. Even if the judges enjoyed the Jews' discomfiture, they by no means expressed this openly. They were undoubtedly sensitive to the religious and political significance of the matter, and we must, therefore, assume that they would not let such incidents pass without reaction on their part. This convinces me more and more that the numbers of incidents in those years, from 1300 to 1350, could not have been much larger than the ones we encountered in the records of the court. Although such incidents were, as we have shown, an uncommon aspect of community life in contemporary Provence, the people and their leaders could not afford to ignore them. We saw how the rabbis involved in legisla- tion, the writers of morality tracts, and the non-Jewish courts were able to 22.

We should have difficulty were we to attempt a historic reconstruction by relying upon one kind of source only: legislation by nature abstracts, freezes, and limits the cases to which it responds. Literature distorts facts for "artistic" reasons. The courts did not always at- tach major importance to historical truth, but sought to act according to their own view of "justice." Combining all three of these sources is what enables us to get to know one little studied aspect of Provencal Jewish social life.</page><page sequence="16">242 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER APPENDIX A Manosque, April 16, 1329. - Bill of indictment in the case against Fos- sonus, Maynetus, Leonetus, Petitus and "others."

When the said Isaac was asked to conduct the prayer, the members of the Baherias family objected vigorously, and their protest provoked the commotion.

Eadem die Bellandus de Orgono judeus unus acusatorum juravit super sanctam legem Moysi stare mandatis dicte curie et dicere veritatem super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui ut principalis in suo facto et ut testis in alieno juramento suo interrogatus super contentis in dicto titulo sibi lecto, juramento suo negavit omnia contra ipsum intitulata penitus fore vera, quoniam non fuit illa die in scolis, quia erat infirmus. Et ut testis dixit se nichil scire. Eadem die Abraam de Areis unus acusatorum juravit stare mandatis dicte curie et dicere veritatem super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui ut principalis in suo facto et ut testis in alieno juramento suo interrogatus super contentis in dicto titulo sibi lecto, ut principalis negavit omnia contra ipsum intitulata penitus fore vera. Et ut testis juramento suo dixit se nichil scire de contentis in eo quoniam non erat infra magnam scolam; ymo erat extra in parva scola qui dicebat oras suas, et magni iudey et divites erant in magna qui dicebant horas et dicebant officium. Interrogatus si scit quod tunc fuerit rumor seu tumultus in dicta sinagoga, dixit quod bene audivit in- fra dictam synagogam magnum rumorem et tumultum quod erat inter ipsos iudeos quoniam videbatur quod se tota domus dirueretur seu funderetur, set pro certo nescit qui dictum rumorem seu tumultum faciebant, quoniam, ut predixit, non erat infra dictam magnam synagogam. Interrogatus si propterea fuit disturbatum divinum officium, dixit pro certo quod nescit. Et factis sibi pluribus interrogationibus, dixit se nichil aliud scire quam se dixit. Eodem die Isaac de Alamania judeus unus accusatorum juravit super sanctam legem Moysi stare mandatis curie predicte et dicere veritatem super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui suo requisitus juramento super con- tentis in titulo inquisitionis predicte ut principalis juramento suo et ut testis in alieno, ut principalis interrogatus dixit fore verum quod eri in festo eorum judei aliqui voluerunt quod ipse legeret legem, et cum induisset stamegnam causa legendi et ascenderet locum ubi legitur, Habraham de Baherias dixit</page><page sequence="28">254 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER ei: "Non ascendatis quoniam non debetis vos legere nec estis dignus." Et ipse incepit legere et alii inceperunt simul verbaliter altercari. Si aliquid fecerunt nescit, ut dicit, quia ipse se atendebat ad legem. Et plura dixit se nescire. Interrogatus quis laceravit legem, dixit quod nescit, quia ipse retinebat unam et Leonetus aliam, nec vidit aliquam laceratam. Cui fuit data x dierum deffensio. Eodem die Leonetus Bonafosii judeus unus accusatorum juravit super sanctam legem Moysi stare mandatis curie predicte et dicere veritatem super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui suo requisitus juramento super con- tentis in titulo inquisitionis predicte ut principalis in suo facto et ut testis in alieno ut principalis interrogatus negat omnia contra ipsum intitulata penitus fore vera. Et ut testis dixit fore verum quod eri fuit quoad eos magnum festum, quia in tali die fuit eis data lex, et cum essent in scola eorum fere omnes congregati ad audiendum eorum misterium, dixerunt in- ter se quis diceret misterium, et aliqui dixerunt quod magister Vitalis diceret, et ipse dixit quod erat fatigatus et non posset nec debet benedicere. Habentes super hiis inter se altercationem sive rumorem sic quod illi Vitalis Daron, Coveti et Leoneti et alii de parte eorum dixerunt quod Isac de Alamania diceret, et illi de Baherias dicebant: "Certe non dicet quoniam non est bene nobiscum et non est dignus dicere, quoniam nemo qui non sit bene cum aliis, sicut bene scitis, non debet dicere." Et sic intimantes de bove in asino, vidit quod Leonetus maliciose et animo irato accepit Colunbonum judeum generum Jacob de Baherias ut non iret ad magistrum Vitalem, et sic quod nisi fuisset ei ablatus per magistrum Bonafosium, ipse credit quod devastasset eum. Et cum Leonetus teneret etiam legem que est sua, voluit ei cadere quia tenebat illum insanum Colunbonum, et tunc magister Bonafosius accepit legem ut non caderet quam dictus Leonetus sibi vi ab- stulit et de inferius ipse Leonetus purpuram de qua lex erat coopertam, ali- quantulum laceravit. Et cum Colunbonus ivisset ad magistrum Vitalem ut diceret ei quod non sustineret quod Isacus legeret legem, Habramonus frater dicti Isaqui maliciose dictum Colunbonum accepit ad gulam. Et plura nescit. Eodem die Leon Frances judeus testis juravit super sanctam legem Moysi bene et legaliter ferre testimonium veritatis super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui suo requisitus juramento super contentis in dicto titulo dixit quod ille tunc erat maius festum quod sit in toto anno eorum, et ipse et Vitalis Darom et Mossonus cui comissa erat electio illius qui debebat facere misterium, vocaverunt Isaac de Alamania si vellet misterium celebrare, et</page><page sequence="29">SOCIAL LIFE OF PROVEN(AL JEWS 255 ipse dixit quod non quia non erat bene cum Jacob de Bayerias. Et tunc or- dinaverunt de quodam extraneo quem elegerunt ut diceret misterium, et dix- it usque meridiem. Et post prope deponens voluit facere pacem de ipso Jacob et de Isaac de Alamania et non potuit. Et tunc dictus Isaac accepit stamegnam causa dicendi misterium, et tunc ipse deponens timens de censtrast: dixit: "Hoc non est pro me," et recessit ad parvam scolam, et plura nescit. Sperandieu judeus testis juramento suo interrogatus per eum prestito super sanctam legem Moysi super contentis intitulo prescripto dixit quod dum Isaac de Alamania accepit legem ipse deponens juvit eum ad displican- dum legem; audivit rumorem inter iudeos suprascriptos, sic quod misterium propterea aliquantulum fuit disturbatum, et inter judeos tamen non vidit aliquem percuti nec legem seu purpuram lacerari. Colonbonus judeus unus accusatorum juravit super legem Moysi dicere veritatem super hiis super quibus fuerit requisitus, qui suo requisitus juramento dixit fore verum quod dum Isacus de Alamania vellet dicere mis- terium Habraam de Baherias et Jacob dixerunt quod non debebat dicere misterium cum non esset bene cum eis, sic quod cum ipse deponens iret mandato dictorum Habraam et Jacob ad magistrum Vitalem dictum quod non sustineret quod ille diceret misterium, Habraam de Alamania percussit ipsum deponentem [derectum] in capite. Et plura nescit, ymo negat contra ipsum intitulata penitus fore vera. Cui fuit data x dierum deffensio. Colligatur contra Leonetum Abramonun de Alamania Abraham de Bavieras et Jacob eius filium.
