Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humani- ties/Israel Exploration Society/Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1997. 640 pp. The significance of nonbiblical written sources for the study of ancient Israel, Judah, and the other states of the Levant is widely recognized. For more than a century, scholars have utilized data gleaned from these voices from antiquity in general histories as well as in specialized investigations dealing with philology, paleography, iconography, and related subjects. Inscribed stamp seals, bullae,' and impressed jar-handles comprise an important part of the extant corpus of epigraphic material. The inscriptions provide not only personal information about the seal owners but insight into the social, economic, and political structure of their societies. A growing number of 1. A bulla (sing.) is a lump of clay impressed with a personal seal. It was attached to the string that sealed a document. Both private and administrative documents were sealed in this manner. Sometimes several bullae were used to seal a single document.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 363 West Semitic seals display official titles and personal names attested in the Bible and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Designations such as "king," "son of the king," and "daughter of the king" as well as the titles of various royal functionaries have appeared on seals. Occasionally, the seal bearer is identifiable with a character known from biblical or extrabiblical sources. Avigad's and Sass's Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals is a most welcome up-to-date reference volume for scholars and students of ancient history and philology. The book represents decades of painstaking collection, research, and notation by Nahman Avigad, whose end goal was to produce a single work encompassing all extant West Semitic seals and sealings. Following Avigad's death in 1992, Benjamin Sass undertook the completion of this huge project. The present corpus includes both the published and unpublished material from Avigad's collection in addition to items published by other scholars through 1991. A total of 1,217 seals and seal impressions are pictured and discussed in the book. The corpus of material is classified according to nationality: Hebrew, Phoenician, Aramaic, Ammonite, Moabite, Edomite, and Philistine. Objects that are not clearly identifiable with a particular national group based on their paleography, personal names, and/or iconography are classified as hybrid; for example, Moabite or Edomite, Hebrew-Phoenician, Hebrew-Aramaic. For each national grouping the ordering is as follows: seals, bullae and other sealings, jar-handle impressions. Seals of titled individuals precede those that are untitled. Except for inscriptions mentioning a royal name, which are arranged chronologically, the objects are listed alphabetically according to the personal names of the seal owners. Seals bearing female names are catalogued separately. The book's introduction focuses primarily on the Hebrew material, al- though it also contains general information pertaining to the study of seals.2 Avigad discusses a variety of issues, such as the uses of seals in antiquity, the onomasticon of the seals and its role in identifying the ethnic origins of seal owners, the presence of official titles on seals, and the social status of women in light of the presence of seals inscribed with female names. A key methodological problem discussed in the introduction is the dating of lapidary inscriptions, in particular seals. Avigad recognizes the imprecise nature of dating based on paleographical and orthographic guidelines. Two major obstacles to this dating method are slow-changing scripts, especially 2. More than half the introduction is taken from Avigad's Hebrew Bullae from the Time of Jeremiah: Remnants of a Burnt Archive (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1986).</page><page sequence="3">364 BOOK REVIEWS the Hebrew script, and evidence that multiple workshops produced the seals. Surprisingly, in his discussion of biblical functionaries Avigad hardly addresses the difficulties involved in identifying seal owners whose names are known from the Bible with the biblical characters. Following the introduction, the body of the volume is divided into two parts. Part I consists of a catalogue of the more than twelve hundred seals and seal impressions representing at least half a dozen national groups. Each entry is displayed by an enlarged photo or drawing alongside a reading of its text. In addition, the object is described in detail as to provenance or mode of acquisition, present location (if known), material, size, inscription, iconography, and estimated date. Personal names known from other sources are cross-referenced and a bibliography is included for the published objects. In cases of special-interest objects, the main points of historical significance are discussed. Part II is a major contribution to the volume by Benjamin Sass. It consists of a glossary of titles and professions, place names, deity names, and other terms, as well as the personal names and their components (prefixes, suffixes, and hypocoristic endings) attested in the corpus. Importantly, this section includes a philological analysis of the West Semitic names and terms. A short section containing statistical analyses follows the glossary. Tables 1 and 2 (pp. 549-551) are especially valuable as they provide statistics on the number of seals and seal impressions assigned to different nationalities, the percentage of provenanced vs. unprovenanced items for each, and the geographical locations of the provenanced finds. Issues surrounding the origin of these objects are a serious concern for this type of work, since the provenance of most of the corpus is unknown. In other words, a large percentage of the seals and seal impressions discussed in this volume, close to 85 percent, does not derive from controlled archaeological excavations but has come to light primarily via the antiquities market. Inherent in objects lacking provenance is the possibility of forgery. The authenticity of a number of objects in this corpus is dubious. Those deemed likely to be forgeries are categorized as "questionable and forged seals" (pp. 453-460). An additional group of forty-nine seals and seal impressions whose authenticity has been questioned is listed in Joseph Naveh's preface to the book (p. 12). Avigad's prize bulla, inscribed "lbrkyhw bn nryhw hspr," which he associates with the biblical Baruch, the scribe of Jeremiah, is conspicuous on this list (#417, two bullae). The inclusion of the items in this group in the present volume is based on Avigad's appraisal that these, as well as all the other unprovenanced objects, are authentic.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 365 Sass is well aware of the possible presence of forgeries in the collection, and consequently he exercises caution by drawing few statistical conclusions. Several of his remarks speak to the issue (e.g., pp. 15, 465, 552). Notably, his final comment on this serious matter appears directly above his name at the end of the volume. It clearly mirrors his deep concern: "The possibility that our mostly unprovenanced material contains forgeries should always be borne in mind, for the impact of such items on works like the present one is inestimable" (p. 552). Given Sass's legitimate concern over authenticity, it is surprising that he did not divide the main catalogue by separating objects derived from controlled archaeological excavations from those acquired by other means. The existing format tends to impart equal validity to provenanced and unprovenanced objects. Still, in the final analysis this volume constitutes a monumental contri- bution to the study of West Semitic seals and sealings. It is an excellent reference source, far more informative than a simple catalogue of objects, and will undoubtedly continue to serve generations of students and scholars. Nili S.
