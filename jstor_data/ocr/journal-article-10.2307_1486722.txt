<plain_text><page sequence="1">426 BOOK REVIEWS Moshe Y. Herczl. Christianity and the Holocaust of Hungarian Jewry. Translated by Joel Lerner. New York: New York University Press, 1993. 299 pp. It is not easy to review the present book, for at least two major reasons. First, the author of the volume has passed away, and therefore words of criticism are aimed in a void. They can meet with the reaction of the scholarly community, but cannot provoke a "face-to-face" confrontation. And next, the very essence of the book is a source of frustration: the volume constitutes an acrimonious attack on Christian and Catholic attitudes toward Judaism and a merciless impeachment of Christianity in Hungary, both the establishment and the faithful. While historians are expected to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, one wonders, in an era when Christianity is seeking avenues toward Judaism, whether a one-sided discussion, however sincere, is the proper way to deal with this painful topic. Moshe Herczl set out to describe the behavior vis-a-vis Jews and Jewish life of Hungary's three major Christian denominations (Catholic, Evangelical, and Reformed, i.e., Calvinist). It should be emphasized that his discussion centers on Hungary proper (Magyarorszag) and the Magyar ethnic group. Nonetheless, when telling the story of the Jews in pre-World War I Hungary, he was hardly able to avoid several stumbling blocks. The Jewry of old Hungary encompassed several different groups, but the nationalistic approach of the Magyar-Jewish establishment treated Jews living in the outer rim and the Jews of "Trianon Hungary" as if they were the same. The Magyar authorities, however, were well aware of the differences, as was thoroughly demonstrated by papers read at the Bar-Ilan University Conference on Hungarian Jewry in the summer of 1994. Without going into details, it seems that the Magyar authorities were more lenient and liberal toward Jews living in the border areas than toward the Jews of Hungary proper. Unfortunately, historians have so far paid little attention to this phenomenon, and Herczl is no exception. While the authorities tended to be more forthcoming to Jews in the border regions, aiming at their Magyarization, Jews of the home country received the hostile treatment typical of Christian Europe. As a result, the growth of antisemitism in Hungary went unnoticed by the local Jewish establishment, which was very anxious to demonstrate its patriotic zeal, and the government did nothing to prevent it. Antisemitism increased steadily in the pre-World War I years, and was exported to Slovakia, Croatia, and other lands of the outer rim. Herczl,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 427 faithful to the tradition of Jewish-Hungarian historiography, takes note of anti-Jewish excesses in the land of the Magyars, but ignores the dynamics of the Magyar-non-Magyar confrontation and its impact on Jewish life in Pannonia and the border areas. The second part of the volume follows and closely analyzes the anti-Jewish line of the Magyar authorities between the two world wars. Jews were no longer regarded as contributing to the survival of the "Magyar race." Jews in the border lands were left alone to face the reality of life in the survivor states, and could play little part in the Magyar struggle against the "diktat" of the treaty of Trianon. Consequently also, the Jews who remained in the Magyar state bore the brunt of undiluted Magyar nationalism. Although Herczl describes the Tisza-Eszlar blood-libel in detail, he is still almost taken by surprise by the vehement hostility to Judaism within the Magyar nation, as if it were something new, unheard of, and unexpected, that came into existence mainly during and after World War I. From this point the author treats Magyar hatred of the Jews as willed by the Almighty-something thoroughgoing, unmitigated, and total. He presents very, very few exceptions to the all-encompassing and unlimited Magyar popular, political, and religious hatred of the Jews. In his treatment of the topic, Herczl tries to persuade his readers that Hungary's churches, government, and populace at large singled out the Jews for discomfiture and mistreatment. But it is well known that other minorities (Serbs, Slovaks, Russians, etc.) were also treated badly, and Serbs too were exterminated. The examples chosen by Herczl to demonstrate his doctrine are convinc- ing. He presents Magyar Christianity as imbued with medieval contempt and hostility toward Jews. He draws all three churches into this picture without the slightest qualification, including religious leaders, rank-and-file clergy, and the masses of believers. The treatment was akin between the wars, until the German occupation of Hungary, and during the final chapter until the end of the war. Before embarking on an analysis of Herczl's modus operandi, it is proper to state that the volume is marred by abundant factographical mistakes and misrepresentations. Sometimes one wonders whether the misrepresentations may have been purposeful or intentional. For example, it is evident that Herczl presents the details of the document termed the "Vrba [!?] report" in a fashion that supports his thesis. (One wonders why he fails to mention Wetzler [Lanik], the man who escaped with Vrba [Rosenberg] and co-authored the report.) Herczl claims that the Vrba-Wetzler report on Auschwitz broke the</page><page sequence="3">428 BOOK REVIEWS terrible news about the death camps in Hungary. In 1942, however, when Gisi Fleischmann (of Slovak "Nebenregierung" fame) was in Budapest to obtain financial support from the leaders of Magyar Jewry, she informed her hosts that Jews were being gassed in the camps. They already knew this, however, and one of them assured Gisi that it was a "sweet death" (edes halal), meaning that it was painless. Gisi's letters are available in numerous archives, and Herczl should have known better. The book's main problem is its uncritical approach to the topic. As was said above, the presentation is convincing, but are these all the avail- able facts? Herczl deals with three Christian denominations. According to his presentation, all three took the same stand toward the persecution of Jews-all three equally bad, equally hostile, equally inconsistent. There were no exceptions and no differences. The reviewer, closely familiar with the Christian churches of Slovakia, which until 1918 constituted a single body with the churches in Lower Hungary, remains unconvinced. The differences between denominations, even in the same city, were considerable. Is it conceivable that Hungary's churches adopted a uniform policy in the short span of twenty or twenty-five years? That there were no local variations, no movement in time and space, everything the same, total hostility? It is hard to believe. The anti-Jewish policies of the Catholic Church and clergy in Hungary, whether before or after World War I, are well known. While the upper nobility, the magnates, defended the Jews, having invited them, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to settle on their estates, the clergy toiled to make the Jewish residents miserable. Still, there were efforts to befriend Jews in the nineteenth century. In Upper Hungary, members of the clergy frequently acted as agents of Magyarization, although admittedly in their view Magyarization also meant conversion, i.e., Magyarization-cum-Christianization. All of this is missing from Herczl's presentation. Solicitude for converts was the only exception to the usual Christian treatment of Jews. The policy of saving souls instead of lives was apparent in many parts of Nazi-occupied Europe, and Hungary was no exception. Nonetheless, although this seems to have eluded Herczl, the church often deviated from the teachings of St. Paul, for adherence to the faith had no racial implications in the era of classical Christianity. Nevertheless, we must ask whether the entire clergy was so blinded by hatred as not to recognize the evil being done to Jews? Herczl admits that there were a few exceptions, but says they could be counted on the fingers of one hand; he claims he was</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 429 unable to find three righteous persons in Hungary like the ones who, in the legend, could have saved Sodom. Herczl, it would seem, was afflicted by the same disease he censured in Christians. Students of the Holocaust in Slovakia are well-familiar with the name of Sister Maria Szlachta, a Magyar nun who contacted the pope in an attempt to rescue Slovak Jewry. Toward her pleading neither Cardinal Seredi nor Rotta, the papal nuncio, remained indifferent. Perhaps it was pre-World War I tendencies that moved Szlachta and Seredi to be concerned about the Jews of the border regions. Nevertheless, their deeds were just, and should not be forgotten. No work dealing with the Holocaust in Slovakia fails to call attention to the efforts of individual members of the clergy to help Jews.xyz Herczl does not mention Maria Szlachta. I am convinced that in this case he acted in good faith, and omitted the good Christian by mistake and not on purpose. Nonetheless, the omission is significant and a testimony against him. Herczl's work was an effort of supreme toil, done by an individual haunted by painful memories. The lack of professionalism in his approach is revealed by his frequent editorial comments, the way he structured the story, and the way he presents it. Quite obviously, he cannot be evaluated by professional standazds. For a layman, he did a good job, but the subject still needs to be treated professionally. Yeshayahu A.
