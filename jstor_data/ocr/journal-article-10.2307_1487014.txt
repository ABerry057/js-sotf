<plain_text><page sequence="1">AGAINST THE TIDE: THE AMERICAN HEBREW YEARBOOK, 1930-1949 by ELI LEDERHENDLER Despite the survival of Hebrew as a language of prayer, and the pockets of Hebrew and Yiddish readers and speakers that exist in America today, American Jewry is overwhelmingly English-oriented in its cultural en- deavors as well as everyday communication. That is one of the measures of American Jewry's successful integration in American society, and may thus be regarded as one of its achievements. On the debit side, of course, one may bewail the inevitable loss of direct access to the considerable cultural assets brought to the United States by the immigrant generation (or left behind by them in Europe). David Roskies has Research for this essay was generously supported by a grant from the Institute of Contem- porary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, for which I am grateful. I would also like to thank Sidra Ezrahi and Anita Norich, who read an early draft of this essay and made valua- ble suggestions for its improvement.

For the most part, access to the Hebraic and Yiddish culture of the past is now mediated for the Jewish public by translators-literary and aca- demic-whose function it is to restore the "lost books" to their rightful heirs. This is no vain attempt of artificial resuscitation or of a facile nostalgia, but a cultural project of potentially lasting significance; nor does "transla- tion" begin to account for the bulk of Jewish cultural activity in America. The Americanization of Jewish culture holds serious ramifications for American as well as Jewish culture, as Cynthia Ozick, Robert Alter, and Gershon Shaked have, in their different ways, suggested. Art, literature, and scholarship, as well as more popular cultural forms, continue to find a home-grown market of cultural consumers in American Jewry.2 Nevertheless, it is the theme of "lost books" that I wish to address here, with my focus on one such "book" in particular: the American Hebrew Yearbook, or Sefer hashanah leyehudei amerikah. Edited for the most part by Menahem Ribalow (who also edited the Hebrew weekly Hadoar), the Year- book was published (somewhat irregularly) between 1930 and 1949. Alto- gether, nine volumes appeared-double volumes 8/9 and 10/11 covering the years 1946-1949. This was by no means the only important American Jewish publication in Hebrew in that period, but it did attract some of the best talent available in the Hebraist community in the United States, and may therefore be regarded as representative of much that was published in other journals. It was also a sustained effort, something of a success in the context of American Hebrew letters; and it covers a particularly fascinating period in American and world Jewish history. Those who have examined the case of the American Hebraists have, in the main, drawn a rather depressing picture. Critical of their literary achievements, observers have, in addition, sought to explain why Hebrew literature was so ephemeral a phenomenon in American Jewish culture. 1. David G.

On the one hand, Hebrew writers and poets were immigrants who never succeeded in captur- ing for themselves a spark of American literary consciousness, and were therefore doomed to be transients in an alien land. On the other hand, they were cut off from the main branch of Hebrew literary creativity in Eastern Europe and the Yishuv.3 Theirs was a cultural ghetto if ever there was one. In addressing myself to the work that was published in the Yearbook, one of my tasks will be to ask whether this "double-alienation" argument suffi- ciently explains what happened to Hebrew writers in America. Jewish immi- grant writers were hardly the only ones to use the theme of alienation for their art; it is clear, in fact, that Jewish writers elsewhere and American writers (both immigrant and non-immigrant, Jews and non-Jews) have made frequent and successful literary use of the outsider experience.4 If we reason that our Hebraists wrote in Hebrew because they were alien, and that they remained alien because they continued to write in Hebrew, we still have not penetrated to the social basis of their alienation. I shall argue that-the "double-alienation" thesis aside-one may better understand the plight of the American Hebrew writers (as reflected in the history of Sefer hashanah) if we look, first of all, at their cultural program, and secondly at the question of their sociocultural function in American Jewry. It was their peculiar lack of function in the American context- mirrored in their lack of a market-that made them an endangered species, rather than their critical, alienated stance. The Background: Out of the Haskalah, Into the Melting Pot Hebrew literature in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe was the metier and the passion of a small elite. Literacy in Hebrew was fairly attenuated 3. See, e.g., Robert Alter, "The Inner Migration of Hebrew Prose," in The Legacy of Jewish Migration.- 1881 and Its Impact, ed. David Berger (New York, 1983), pp. 100-101; J. K.

The ubiquitous nature of this theme, from Wasserman to Kafka, from Delmore Schwartz to Philip Roth (and see the comment by Cynthia Ozick quoted at the end of this essay, n. 110), can be extended to include many American writers, including black writers as well as others.</page><page sequence="4">54 ELI LEDERHENDLER among the general Jewish public-that is, normally confined to the male population, and even then, generally reduced to the basics, which included the ability to recite psalms, daily prayers, and so on. In addition, of course, the modern maskilic literature was not read at all by large sections of the public, out of religious-ideological considerations. Yet, in the East European context, Hebrew continued to function along- side Yiddish as a Jewish language, and its use as a literary language, as circumscribed as it was, made sense. Even for the barely literate, Hebrew provided a cornucopia of quotations, allusions, maxims, and puns. As one observer has put it, recourse to Hebrew was necessary in a society that com- municated in a Jewish language; thus Yiddish preserved Hebrew.5 The early maskilim pioneered the use of Hebrew for a new, secular pur- pose: art, and they championed a cultural vision that embraced a humanist universal optimism. In the universal culture of the modern age, they firmly believed, the role of Hebrew could hardly be negligible. Later in the nineteenth century, however, they confronted the dismaying fact that many young Jews who had acquired Russian or European educa- tions had not only jettisoned their parents' Yiddish (as the maskilim had advised), but no longer had any real use for Hebrew. German, Polish, or Russian served them far better as a bridge to contemporary civilization. Dis- appointed old-line maskilim like Judah Leib Gordon faced the devastating prospect of having labored in vain ("For whom do I toil?" Gordon lamented). It was the nationalist Hebraists like David Gordon, Peretz Smolenskin, and Eliezer Ben-Yehuda who began in the 1870s to restore to Hebrew its secular, cultural functionality. As Gershon Shaked has remarked, their for- ward orientation toward a Jewish future in Palestine neatly complemented Hebrew's connecting links backward to a classical past, and these combined elements lent Hebrew its functional significance for the present.6 Not only was Hebrew to be made over into a language of everyday com- munication, but in the realm of literature itself, too, there were major new developments. The new literary trends demanded a more supple, stream- lined language than the florid, stylized Hebrew of the Haskalah. Thus, Hebrew literary creativity in Russia was just gathering new 5.

While Eliezer Ben-Yehuda found his way to Jerusalem to revamp the Hebrew language, and while Odessa was becom- ing the capital of Hebrew letters in Russia, a different destiny cast a handful of adult Hebrew writers (and a more generous share of young, future writers) ashore in "the land of Columbus." This is not the place to examine their paltry output. For the sake of a brief orientation, however, we might note that literary historians agree on three points about the writers who were active from the 1870s until the eve of the First World War: that the quality of their work was not high; that none of their journals survived very long, though they valiantly kept on try- ing; and that their poetry expressed, in the main, themes of estrangement and insularity.7 The social environment that had given Hebrew writers a certain scope in Eastern Europe, despite their relatively small numbers, was lacking in the United States. Primarily, they lacked not only colleagues but readers. Com- ing just as the wave of immigration from Eastern Europe was beginning, these writers found an English-speaking Jewish community that hardly ever prayed in Hebrew anymore and that was spiritually far-removed from the Russian Haskalah. In America, where the major strategy of acculturation revolved around a monolingual policy, there was no equivalent to the bi- ringual symbiosis of Yiddish and Hebrew that had coexisted in Eastern Europe with a third, gentile language. Perhaps just as important, they had left the Russian heartland of Hebrew letters just prior to the great surge in creativity and modernism that was to take place there, and thus did not participate in a crucial phase in Hebrew literary development. Judah Leib Gordon's disciple, Menahem Dolitsky, for instance, was to have been the torchbearer of the Haskalah in the New World, but he suc- cumbed instead to "dull, gray pessimism and despair."8 Economic priva- tion and an inability to see the positive side of America found literary expression in either mourning or bitter satire.9 7. Ribalow, Antologiah, "Hashirah ha'ivrit beamerikah," p. 3; Alter, "Inner Migration," p. 100. Even their contemporaries were not terribly impressed by their work. Mordecai Ze'ev Raizin wrote, in 1901, that "American Hebrew literature will not be able to raise itself from its current low level," although he allowed for the chance that the new immigration from Russia would bring fresh talent to American shores.

A new phase began around 1914, when a new crop of writers came on the scene. These represented a generation who had arrived in America as chil- dren or adolescents in the 1890s or the early 1900s, as well as more recent, youthful arrivals. Perhaps they were graced with greater talent and skill; perhaps they felt more at home in America, having grown up there or having a much larger East European Jewish immigrant hinterland around them; perhaps they were more directly influenced by the newer Hebrew literature of Europe. Their arrival, at any rate, was noticed. Ephraim Deinard, an old-line maskil who had himself arrived in the United States in 1888, found them insufferable. His bibliography of Hebrew books in America (published in 1926) opened with a diatribe against what he called "the modernists." He refused to dignify the scribblings of these semiliterate usurpers with the name of "literature," and therefore decided to call his book Kohelet amerikah-roughly, "An American Collection"- rather than (as he originally intended) Sifrut yisrael beamerikah ("The Literature of Israel in America").'o In addition to their many other sins, it seems, the major crime of which the new writers stood accused in Deinard's book was their attempt to turn Hebrew into "Yiddish"; that is, to pass off profane, mimetic speech as "pure" Hebrew. The "modernists" had "covered the land like locusts" and destroyed the few precious shoots that had grown up amid the alien corn. They were unmitigated camp followers of the accursed Ben-Yehuda, "the new Sabbetai Zevi ... the satan who has chosen Jerusalem," and new- fangled "Bnei Moshe" types (i.e., adherents of Ahad Ha'am's cultural re- naissance movement)." Clearly the younger Hebrew writers in America had a lot to answer for: most of all, perhaps, for pushing aside the work of the pioneer generation. As we shall see, their path, too, was not strewn with roses. Most of them remained immigrant writers-transplanted on foreign shores with little chance for real success. For some of them, their own sense of marginality was profound. 10.

The Jews there were "constantly tossed between three worlds: the hemmed-in Exile of Europe, the open spaces of America, and the Promised Land." Mining his maskilic, part classical Hebraic, part modernist cultural consciousness, he found that the crashing, "full-throated" song of New York was one that "Jonah's ear never heard in Nineveh, a symphony of the gods that Wagner could not have imagined."'2 The poet, both repelled and attracted, observed the urban landscape from the safe distance of his foreignness ("from afar"), unsure whether "this [is] the palace of the king [melekh] or the House of Molokh," where human lives can be swallowed up into the abyss. Yet the pathos of his yearning to find kindred spirits and to become as one with the teeming metropolis comes across clearly in this passage: The night train carries me across Williamsburg Bridge... And all around ... I see strands upon strands of small, flickering lights, each beckoning and calling to the others. In that instant my soul, too, plunges into the night, seeking its sisters, the flames kindled, like itself, to light the night-world. Alone but enchanted, the night rider concludes on a note of optimism and salvation. The "hidden lights" recall the divine "sparks" of Kabbalah mysticism which, when gathered, can redeem the world; and redemption is alluded to, again, in phrases lifted from Judaism's redemption liturgy, the Passover Haggadah (indicated here in italics): By whose design have so many secret lights, 12.

Other voices, more confident and self-assertive, found it possible to bask in America without Ginsburg's ambivalence. Menahem Ribalow, the in- defatigable editor of Hadoar, who would found Sefer hashanah and guide it throughout its career, was enthusiastic about the prospects of Hebrew litera- ture in America. In 1927 he issued a call for a new literature, "The Procrustean Bed or Boundless Freedom?" ("Mitat sedom umer1havyah"), that may well have been conceived as a reply to Deinard. This cultural manifesto, bursting with the exuberance of the Roaring Twenties, is worth a close examination here because it touches on a number of themes that figure in Sefer hashanah over the subsequent twenty years. Ribalow's point of departure was the sense of malaise that had beset his fellow Hebraists in America, a malaise that stemmed from a lack of direc- tion and purpose. The poetry of mourning and impotence had led to a dead end (alluded to in the essay's title). How could any writer worth his salt remain so woefully out of touch with the mood of "these marvelous times"?'3 The First World War, Ribalow argued, was a caesura as much for Jewish as for Western culture generally. The war and the Bolshevik revolu- tion that followed had swept away the remains of the nineteenth-century shtetl civilization that had for so long been the anchor and mythic universe of modern Jewish literature. Bereft of the one sure home (literal and figura- tive) they had ever known, Hebrew writers in America needed to discover a new artistic hearth.14 13.

Ibid., pp. 10-11, 14.</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN HEBREW YEARBOOK, 1930-1949 59 Moreover, as Ribalow correctly pointed out, the fructifying connection with Russian literature, too, had been severed. "Russia was our homeland in every sense," and Russian literature had been the chief influence on the younger Hebrew writers.'" Without the Russian compass, Hebrew writers needed to hook into a different, but equally powerful, literary tradition. Why not the Anglo-American one? "America," he asserted, "is becoming the greatest, most vital center of Jewish life, with vast potential for the future."'6 Ribalow's admiration for America was boundless. With a Sandburgian hymn to industry and progress, he produced a Hebrew American equivalent of that sense of rootedness that in Poland was called doh-ikayt (lit. "here- ness"). A kind of America fever has gripped the world and is pushing it toward work and creativity. We [Jews in America] are at the center of the whirlpool. .... the unleashed energy we are witnessing embodies the mystique of a new mytho- logy, contains the seed of new life .... [America] has released great forces in humanity and has commanded them: Arise! ... We have tied our fate to the fate of the world, and with its ascent, we will ascend. The land of Israel will be part of it too, and our [Hebrew] literature-one blossoming branch of this tree of life. We will break out of the Procrustean bed in which we were trapped and emerge into the freedom that calls to us."7 Ribalow was given to such grandiose outbursts, but behind his pontifi- cating rhetoric we may perceive several significant and serious ideas. The motifs of "hereness," cultural optimism, and Hebrew as a com- ponent of world culture are reminiscent of the Russian Haskalah of the mid-nineteenth century, and the exact opposite of cultural insularity or ghettoism. Haskalah ideology sought to transcend the alternatives of parti- cularism and universalism by invoking a Judaism that would represent one stream within a single, universal, humanistic vision. This was a position adopted, as well, by the best exponents of secular Zionist humanism, them- selves heirs of the Haskalah, to whom Ribalow was more closely connected. In addition, Ribalow's faith in human progress and the positive cultural value of scientific and industrial endeavor bore more than passing resemb- 15. Ibid., pp. 10, 14. 16. Ibid., pp. 14-15. 17. Ibid., pp. 11, 15.</page><page sequence="10">60 ELI LEDERHENDLER lance to the aesthetic outlook championed in the name of "futurism" in Soviet art and literature of the first postrevolutionary years. Thus, Ribalow's celebration of postwar America (he himself had arrived only in 1921) and his call for a Hebrew literature attuned to the best in uni- versal civilization were of a piece with the Russian Jewish tradition that had produced him. But his position also derived from the peculiar dilemma of Hebraists in America, where even the newest immigrant wave (and the second generation, in particular) was making the transition from a bilingual to a monolingual, English culture. Choosing to work in Hebrew threatened to place the Hebraist writers in a cultural ghetto. They could operate within that ghetto-and remain with a literature of alienation-or they could try to connect with the world outside. Ribalow's message was a statement against marginality. The only other option was a literature of vicarious experience, either dwelling on the receding European past or attempting to echo the Hebrew rebirth in Palestine. This was possible, of course, and was resorted to by some writers, but it risked artistic inauthenticity. It remains to be seen whether the self-conscious Americanism expressed by Hebrew writers from the 1920s to the 1940s was equally vicarious, and hence equally inauthentic. This, indeed, is the charge leveled at them by literary historians, who conclude that this was one of the fundamental reasons why Hebrew letters in America was so transitory a phenomenon.8 Hebrew Humanism, the Depression Years, and American Judaism By 1930, when the first volume of Sefer hashanah was published, the heady, "marvelous times" of which Ribalow had written had changed for the worse. The previous year had brought with it the onset of the Great Depression, as well as serious rioting in Palestine. By 1933 Hitler would come to power in Germany and Jewish confidence in universal progress would have to be tempered. The first four volumes of the Yearbook (1930, 1935, 1938, and 1939) reflect both Ribalow's original program-Hebrew humanism and cultural optimism-and more sober realities. 18. Alter, "Inner Migration," p. 97: ". .. with rare exceptions, their efforts to acclimate Hebrew literature to the American scene were strained, self-conscious, and artistically uncon- vincing."

Contributors were drawn from Europe and Palestine, in addition to the American-based writers and scholars. This may have been partly caused by the scarcity of local talent, but a rationale was also articulated in the second volume of the Yearbook. We have sought to avoid being overly parochial in our Americanism ... for we know that Hebrew literature is a world literature. It is not language alone that unites us, but also our common yearnings and the inner meaning of our writing, which derive from the self-same sources.19 Yet, together with the Hebraist-nationalist point of view, the cosmo- politan-humanistic outlook is also strongly represented. The range of topics indicates a heavy stress on universal themes and on Jewish involvement in the arts and sciences. Zvi Rudy, for example, in an essay on Jews in contemporary philosophy, submitted that there were no national philosophies in the substantive sense: philosophy transcended the lines of race and nationality. Nevertheless, philosophy was a creative activity that takes place in particular linguistic and cultural contexts. Thus, he concluded, in terms of external form one may speak of German, Latin, or Anglo-American philosophy, among which "our own wandering Hebrew spirit" finds its place.20 Avraham Goldenberg's essay on Nahum Sokolow (the Zionist leader and probably the most prolific Hebrew writer of his day) hailed him as "The Jewish European." Noting the tendency of some nationalist writers to shun the influence of international culture and to reject its impact on Judaism, Goldenberg highlighted Sokolow's contrasting approach. He is a European through and through; he has no need to isolate himself in his Jewish ghetto, because his Europeanness does not negate his Jewishness. He is, however, not an unalloyed European-there has never been such a creature- but a Jewish European, just as there are German and Italian Europeans.... Sokolow is at once both "man and Jew ... within his tent" as well as "with- out" [paraphrasing Judah Leib Gordon].21 19.

The impact of shattering human experiences and world-shaking events comes across in two forceful statements: a war poem by Mordecai Golden- berg, and a programmatic statement by Menahem Ribalow. Goldenberg, reflecting much of the stereotypical literary images of the Great War, evoked the mud and desperation of trench warfare.22 Ribalow's statement, though very different in spirit, also sought to place the role of art, and of Hebrew literature in particular, within the context of a world that seemed somehow to have gone awry. At best it had become less familiar and comfortable. No longer quite as optimistic as in his pre- Depression days, Ribalow noted that the social underpinnings of the old order-morals, justice, marriage, relations between parents and children- were being radically recast. He touched on Freud, atomic physics, and anthropology, and their implications for "a new metaphysics" and a new understanding of human nature. Modernity, he concluded, was "a nettle" that must be grasped, but, tragically, people were still existentially out of step with the events and processes that had overtaken them.23 In reverting to this minor key, Ribalow seemingly returned to the theme of alienation which, as already noted, was part of the crisis of Hebrew litera- ture that he hoped to overcome. To counter this tendency, Ribalow con- tinued to stress that the Jewish writer would have to meet head-on the rapid and extreme changes taking place in the world. Writers should "find the connecting link between humanity and our Jewishness, that dwells within us and demands a resolution."24 The "Jewish person" (haadam hayehudi--again, a play on Gordon and also Ahad Ha'am, and a reference to the universal side of Jewish conscious- ness) faced a doubly difficult adjustment, for in attempting to meet the new challenges, Jews, as a minority, had first of all to adjust to dominant foreign cultures and to social situations that, lately, had assumed an ominous and even hostile character: "No wonder, then, that we tremble for our lives and for our creative spirit."25 The destructive potential of that very modernity whose praises he had 22.

But literary reviewer A. A. Ben-Yishai felt that the outlook for Hebrew literature in America was not bright. He did not wish to impugn the talent of individual writers, but was making a judgment on the sum total of what had been produced, in relation to the resources and potential of American Jewry. American Hebrew writers--Ben-Yishai estimated their number at 130-were altogether too complacent: too ready to pat themselves on the back, too eager to avoid real self-criticism.26 Here, then, was an acknowledgment of failure to reach beyond the con- fines of the Hebrew literary fraternity (curiously, though perhaps inevitably, no women writers were in evidence). With a Jewish community numbering in the millions, the impact of Hebrew writers remained woefully limited. Several years later, Nissan Touroff would also question the viability of a literature that remained within a circumscribed group of writers, without a broader social connectedness.27 The first volume was rounded out by several articles relating to Jews and Judaism in the United States. Azriel Chipkin reported on Jewish education in New York, with data comparing the situation in 1929 favorably with that of 1916.28 Meir Waxman presented a sober report on rabbis and the rab- binate in the United States.29 Finally, Mikhl Ivensky contributed "The Jewish Labor Movement in America." With the onset of the Depression, joblessness and working condi- tions had become a major concern. Ivensky's survey article focused on what had been accomplished for the Jewish worker in the past, and presented a tour d'horizon of the Jewish unions, the Jewish labor press, and the labor- oriented fraternal organizations. America, Ivensky stated, was a wonderful country for organizing things.30 This first volume of the Yearbook, then, reaffirmed many of the values that animated the American Hebraist community: a commitment to Jewish culture and Jewish identity, a penchant for self-criticism, a degree of social 26.

Here the editors (Ribalow and S. Bernstein) expressed their desire to "continue what we attempted to do when we first began several years ago . . . to pluck from the stormy seas of America the scattered pearls of Judaism and, above all, to rescue the lonely Hebrew word from the din of foreign culture around us.""32 The dichotomies (America vs. Judaism, Hebrew vs. foreign) are instruc- tive. The Depression years brought with them a more somber assessment of American and American Jewish realities. By the end of the 1930s this was compounded by a sense of doom surrounding European Jewry. But volumes 2, 3, and 4 of the Yearbook also continued to reflect the Hebraists' commit- ment to a humanistic worldview. Thus, we find a continuing cosmopolitan motif in the wide range of sub- jects drawn from American and European intellectual life.33 The force of the Hebrew-humanist argument was most explicit, however, in an essay of Nahum Sokolow's published in the 1935 volume, "Hebrew Nationalism Through Humanism." Sokolow argued against poli- tical chauvinism, on the one hand (clearly aimed at the Revisionist Zionist movement led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky), and on the other hand, against endless philosophizing about kultura, that is, the interminable debate over culture, Jewishness, and national identify-a jab at the Ahad Ha'amist school. Both the one and the other were reflections of a luftmensch mentality, Sokolow maintained. Real work was needed to build a satisfactory social and economic infrastructure in Palestine. This work of construction-which 31. It is not clear why it took five years to produce the second volume, and why a further three years elapsed between the second and third volumes. It is possible that financial consider- ations played a role; the Yearbook depended on support from donors and received funding from at least one foundation. It is likely, too, that it was technically difficult to edit and pro- duce a book of that scale, and with so many authors, rapidly. See the preface to volume 2, and the list of contributors published at the back of the volume.

Concentrating on technology, planning, and productivity, not intellectual short-cuts or cheap imitations of European nationalism, was the way to provide the Jews with both a distinct national identity and equality among the nations.34 He couched this advice in a general argument about the nature of humanity, the individual, and the nation, in which he stressed the great value of both group attachments and individual self-reliance. This was the essence of the human condition as Sokolow saw it, and this was the sense in which he understood the humanism of the Zionist enterprise.35 Sokolow was primarily addressing the situation in Palestine, but the thrust of the argument was also bound to appeal to American Hebraists like Ribalow, who wanted to see Jewish pride rest on Jewish accomplishments in the real world, and who, like Sokolow, sought a balance between the univer- sal and the particular. The 1930s saw a stress on Americanism among some of the Hebrew writers and poets. Israel Efros and Ephraim Lissitsky wrote their "Indian" poetry during this period, for example.36 Whether this was romantic escap- ism that signaled their marginality, a search for a pastoral setting more in keeping with the Hebrew literary tradition, or the expression of an affinity for other oppressed peoples,37 may be of less consequence than the fact that such poets felt the need for "American" content and symbolism. Other writers used local material that was closer to their own experience. Ginsburg's "New York" has already been cited. Another poet of this period, 34.

Halevy mingled disparate sound and visual sensations to evoke a raucous but lyrical New York morning. Morning's freshness slid down the skyscrapers ... the tracks of the el glistened in the sun, flowing like streams.... The screeching of a wild beast from the chains of wheels- is it a newborn day being murdered? But the city cannot block out the sun or frighten off the new day, so long as there are pigeons singing their joy. Towers leap from their foundations and soar in mid-air. The city's uproar is stilled... and the world smiles its magic upon man.38 This highly individual, expressive, and sensual type of writing was characteristic of a whole group of poets (Gabriel Preil, Hillel Bavli, and others). Summing up trends in Hebrew poetry in the 1930s, Ribalow identi- fied this "quiet" and "classical" approach as an American school of Hebrew verse, quite different from the sound and fury of Hebrew poetry abroad (chiefly in Palestine), and comparable to the quiet romanticism of Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.39 Those looking for Americana in [Hebrew] poetry here will complain of the insufficient use of native material; but those looking first of all for poetry will find here those perennial themes that have always moved the hearts of poets.... After a long arid period, after years of stumbling versifiers, .... a vibrant stream of just plain poetry, humanist and Jewish, had to emerge. . . . In this humanist Jewish poetry we perceive the personalities of the poets as indivi- duals, and when seen together it is evident that they are American poets.40 38.

These immigrant Yiddish writers became conscious of their individuality against the looming sky- scrapers and bridges and the rushing subways."42 It would seem reasonable, therefore, to propose a synoptic view of common cultural responses that transcended the bounds of the respective literary traditions of Yiddish and Hebrew. The emergence of a Jewish-American literature, whether self- consciously American or not, reflected more than the gropings of a few intellectuals. In the 1930s domestic concerns became increasingly important to American Jews. This was partly the result of the Depression, which not only affected jobs and income in light industry, the building trades, and small business (fields in which Jews were heavily concentrated), but also created a new "relief class" of unemployed Jewish white-collar workers.43 At the same time, alarming developments in Europe tended to underscore the contrast between American democracy and conditions overseas. One writer in the Yearbook pointedly remarked on the vast difference between the New Deal as the American response to economic crisis and the corresponding German and Italian reactions. He took pride in the involve- ment of Jews in shaping and directing the federal programs aimed at achiev- ing economic recovery.44 Another writer noted that sermons in American (Orthodox) synagogues no longer routinely cast aspersions on America as a setting for a viable Judaism (as they had done prior to the First World 41.

Their poems and stories are individualistic expressions of men's souls in the contemporary city: moods, images, tender yearnings ... intimacies of the heart, intricacies of experience, and despair." 42.

Shimon Ginsburg's narrative poem "Memorial-An American Idyll" reflected mainly negative themes: the coarse materialism and philistine self-absorption of many of his fellow Jews, and the delerious impact of the Depression on the Jewish social fabric. In addition, the poem dealt with the lonely struggle of the Jewish educator against the inroads of Americanization. (Many of the Hebrew writers earned their living in the field of Jewish education.) Ginsburg considered America "a land that devours its races" (eretz okhelet geza'ehah, punning on the evil reports about the land of Canaan brought back to Moses in the desert).47 Yet, despite the banality, vulgarity, and ignorance that he found in American Judaism, Ginsburg concluded on a note of sentimentality. Mar- veling that acts of goodness, devotion, and loyalty could exist in America as well, he called them a saving grace that might restore the soul of American Jewry and, in the process, provide the vindication and inspiration for Hebrew poetry in an alien land.48 Some of the fiction published in the late 1930s also reflected ambivalence about American values. Reuven Wallenrod's short story "The Family Circle" was set in the Depression years and dealt with the conflict between an immigrant drugstore owner and his Americanized adult children. Though the story is heavy-handed, the ambience of the American Jewish neighborhood is carefully conveyed: the music on the radio in the living room; the immigrant mother's driving ambition for her American-educated children; the teenagers hanging out on the corner, where they skirmish with the grumpy storekeeper even as they buy his ice cream.49 In Wallenrod's flexible Hebrew we find words Ben-Yehuda never dreamed of: popsicles, fudgicles, payntim ("pints"), and hatzi-payntim ("half-pints"). Such adoption of street speech as a strategy for writers was pioneered, of course, by the Yiddish press, particularly the Forverts. 45. Rabbi Shmuel K.

Articles devoted to the demographic impact of occupational change, the Depression, and the increasing proportion of American-born Jewish parents voiced concern over shrinking Jewish birth rates and concomitant trends toward an aging Jewish population.52 Despite this considerable involvement with the American scene, the eyes of Hebraists in early 1939 (volume 4 was published in March of that year) inevitably also turned toward Europe and Palestine. Eisig (Yitzhak) Silber- schlag's play on Ferdinand and Isabella recalled past ages of expulsion and persecution,53 while Yohanan Twersky's dramatized version of Theodor Herzl's encounter with the Kaiser in Jerusalem in 1898 posed the Zionist alternative to the Jewish fate in Europe.54 But the most compelling statement conveying a sense of hard times and impending doom was a poem by Gabriel Preil that took an unmistakably American symbol as its leitmotif: "Washington Remembers."55 Preil sets the scene in lower Manhattan near the East River, where an equestrian statue of George Washington dominates a bridge plaza. Young strollers have come out to enjoy some evening air on a sweltering night. There the poet also encounters the statue. Washington's once-youthful vigor, courage, and pride, it seems to him, are gone now; old age and feeble- ness prevent him from galloping through the night. Now, only the coming of daylight can drive away his fear, whereas once the evening "framed his marvelous visage."56 50.

Young mothers put children to bed, destined to be killers and casualties in the approaching future of blood.57 The Life of the Mind in Dark Times The 1930s, even more than the First World War, severed the American Hebrew writers from Europe and all that it represented. Conscious of this separation throughout the interwar years, some writers were left culturally stranded, while others were driven to seek new literary moorings in the New World-in the throbbing urban landscape, in the natural beauty of the countryside,"58 or even in the Old West of Indians, the frontier, and the Gold Rush."9 But regardless of whether they chose to write of the New World or the Old, the land of the Bible or the land of opportunity, many of the writers had been imbued with a sense of mission vis-a-vis the maintenance of a Hebrew literary tradition. There was thus positive value in pursuing the life of a Hebrew writer in America, a value that grew out of a sense of historic responsibility. The Second World War, and with it the Holocaust of European Jewry, intensified these reactions.60 This time the destruction was far greater than in 1914-1921, although this only became evident after the first two or three years of the war. On the one hand, this demanded a more direct identifica- tion with the Jewish people in its hour of tragedy. By 1943, certainly by 1944, this tended to diminish the value of such themes as humanism and 57. Ibid. 58. See, e.g., Gabriel Preil's "Shirei vermont," SH 5 (1940): 109-110. 59.

On the other hand, it also imposed on those writers who were far from the "city of slaughter" an onerous responsibility: to keep the thread of continuity of cultural creation intact. In recent years we have come to appreciate the various forms of what has been called "spiritual resistance" offered by the Jews of occupied Europe against the Nazis, including art in all its forms. Literary and scholarly activ- ity in wartime America, though hardly belonging to the same order of things, nevertheless fits into a general framework that might be called the Jews' refusal to submit to fate and succumb to despair. As the war began it was again Menahem Ribalow who signaled (albeit obliquely) the type of response that the times seemed to call forth. Taking the author of Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) as his point of reference, Ribalow observed: There is in him a fine and sophisticated balance between individual and collec- tive sorrow, faith and doubt, darkness and light ... life and death. Life ulti- mately triumphs and even conquers the deep despair of Kohelet, because this poet-sage, after all, was a Jew.61 At the beginning of the war this faith in survival and the commitment to art and culture "in spite of everything" seemed to dominate much of what was published in the Yearbook. There is almost an air of business-as-usual in some of the work that appeared. Poems by Hillel Bavli, for example, dealt exclusively with the theme of art and the search for beauty and creativity.62 We find essays on purely historical topics, such as those on Rashi, for instance, written by Meir Waxman and Shmuel Mirsky;63 and the specula- tive article "Theories of Physiognomy," by Nissan Touroff, which dealt sympathetically with a subject perilously close to racial theories.64 Even material that dealt specifically with the war and the tragedy of European Jewry tended to emphasize the Jews' ability to survive, despite painful losses.

In an article entitled "The Destruction of Polish Jewry," S. Rosenfeld clearly was not speaking about physical extermination per se (though the slaughter of thousands of Jews was included in what he meant by "destruction"). Rather, he was referring mainly to the idea that Polish Jewry, as a social and historical entity, would never again be reconstituted in any recognizable form or return to "normal." His assumption was that the Allies would win the war, and that once again, as in 1918, a significant Jewish population would face the prospect of life in an independent Poland. But this time, he forecast, most Polish Jews would choose to emigrate, based on their failure to become integrated in interwar Poland.66 Finally, the Yearbook also dealt with American's role in accepting Jewish refugees, beginning with the influx from Germany in the 1930s. A discussion of the plight of the wartime refugees expressed hope and confidence in Presi- dent Roosevelt's ability to win congressional acquiescence in a humani- tarian refugee policy.67 None of this sets the mentality of this group of Hebrew writers apart from ideas generally propounded by American Jewry at the time. Most of these writers had been in the United States for some thirty years or more, and there is no evidence to suggest that their perspective or consciousness was different from that of their American Jewish peers. I stress this point because I think that it illuminates, from yet another angle, the issue of the American Hebraists' alleged isolation or alienation from America and American Jewry. Echoes of the theme of iberlebn-of the Jews' ability to surmount virtual- ly any threat to their survival-continued to reverberate in the Yearbook for several years.

(Shneour, probably the most important Hebrew poet at the time, had escaped from Paris in 1940 and lived in the United States from 1941 to 1951.) The basis of the poem was an iconoclastic counter- scripture-a modern, subversive pseudepigrapha of sorts. The historical frame provided for the newly "rediscovered" texts was the first destruction of Jerusalem and the determination of the king of Judea and his priests to save for posterity the records of Israelite culture. These "tablets," or scrolls, destined not to be found again for centuries, were "lost" to the biblical canon but represented a hidden, perhaps truer tradition than the expurgated canonical account.7' Though the main point of this work is unrelated to the Holocaust, a number of key passages refer to the immortality of the cultural treasures set down in Jewish writings. This message held particular resonance for writers during the years of this new hurban habayit of the twentieth century: the life of Jewish creativity, recorded in books, would outlive the awful conflagra- tion. Not all writers, to be sure, could find comfort or literary inspiration in the theme of survival. To Gabriel Preil, for example, poetry had to come from life, not death; there was no poetic answer to mass slaughter. In "There Are No Words," he replied to those who "look to me [in vain] for words of flint, words like burning embers, that might soak up the blood of my people, heal it with balm . . .Alas, in lawless times words become birds with broken backs."72 No dam could ever stop the rivers of blood, no channel could restore the flow of life to the severed veins of slaughtered infants, and there was not even any comfort in somehow being spared, only to bear wit- 69.

Therefore, "words, too, have failed, no new suns will shine in them, no old wines will ever again bubble forth from them."73 The war revealed what is commonly called the bestiality of human beings. Nissan Touroff attempted to provide the Hebrew reader with some understanding of this phenomenon from the point of view of social psycho- logy. To what extent, he, asked, were aggression, violence, and war an in- delible part of the human psyche? Delving into various aspects of the problem, from classical history to the erotic side of sadism and masochism, to the psychology of the soldier facing death, he acknowledged that war was, in fact, deeply rooted in the human experience and perhaps even "nor- mal."74 Providing a passionate counterpoint to this depiction of perpetual con- flict and of the human capacity to inflict death without conpunction, Abraham Joshua Heschel's essay "Piety" ("Fear of God") attempted to reaffirm humanist values and restore the ideal of the sanctity of life.75 It took moral courage to sustain this belief in the transcendental mean- ing of life-and the possibility of overcoming the brutality of death-in the very darkest hour of Jewish history. Others were far less willing than Heschel to believe that the moral universe he described would ever again exist. Two poems by Israel Efros, published in Sefer hashanah in 1944, expressed contempt for Europe and all its murderous history of Jew-hatred, and vented rage at conventional Judaic theodicies. In the first poem, "In Old Germany," Efros chose a medieval setting to underscore the idea that nothing had changed in hundreds of years of persecution. He also alluded, with savage irony, to Jewish ritual and flaunted phrases from the 'Aleinu prayer, which he used both to castigate the Germans and to give Jewish "chosenness" a devastating new interpretation.76 In the second poem, "A People," Efros conveyed his sense of Jewish helplessness in the face of the bloodbath that was relentlessly destroying his people and human civilization; and (again alluding to God's role, partly through a phrase from 'Aleinu-indicated in italics) once more posed the question of theodicy. 73.

With blades we expose our hearts and entrails to him until he is drenched with our blood.... Is he a creature of God or the work of the devil?

Looking for Something to Live For Two more volumes of the Yearbook appeared, in 1946 and 1949, in which the American Hebraist community had the opportunity to mourn, to re- assess its position in the world and, finally, to celebrate the birth of the Jewish state. (The faltering continuity in the Yearbook's appearance may be partly explained by the fact that Menahem Ribalow, who had been sole editor of all the volumes since the third, was involved in several other major publish- 77.

His "More Silent than a Dream" told of the numbing shock and silence that burdened the remnant of his people: "Dumbstruck, as if in a trance, we go on living."79 In "Tomorrow God Will Appear," he contrasted the post- war world, washed spanking-clean, with the Jew's inability to share in the celebration: "As for me, all my wounds will cry out in this sparkling, better world, and wherever I tread I will drip blood that can find no solace and for which there can be no atonement."80 Finally, "After Mourning" came reassessment: a new understanding of how "brittle and hollow" was the life of culture that Jews had built up over the centuries. With fewer illusions now, perhaps, they were fated neverthe- less to continue to plow the same furrow over again, in the same old rhythm of "Jewish time," which knew a tempo all its own."8 Another series of post-Holocaust poems was contributed by Aharon Zeitlin. In his turn, he wrote of the difficulty of facing the world and life again, of the renewal of the spirit that writing might bring, of his yearning for his destroyed Warsaw home, almost palpably real but locked forever in incorporeal memory, and finally, of the futility of grief and prayer. Even if God Himself tried to wrest a cry from His lips-He could not. As the slaughtered millions are silent, so would the son of Hilkiah [Jeremiah] be left wordless before the ineffable. Now even crying aloud is useless: Tears turn to mere literature, all prayers are for nought.82 78.

The titles of his</page><page sequence="27">THE AMERICAN HEBREW YEARBOOK, 1930-1949 77 Gabriel Preil, whose expressionist style did not easily lend itself to "national poetry," found himself overtaken by an inexplicable, wintry melancholy in the midst of a spring day: "Then come, desolate tear, find yourself a nest in the corner of my eye, come, whisper; even the future is trapped and swallowed up in the maw of the night.""83 As for fiction, a short story by Benjamin Ressler ("A Soldier Returns from the War") narrated a tale of an amputee who returned from the war with a new sense of his Jewishness. Gentile America, symbolized by the soldier's non-Jewish girlfriend, is left standing at the doorstep as the Jewish family becomes more central.84 Altogether, the effect of the Holocaust on the intellectual world of these writers was traumatic. The literary section of the 1946 volume returned to the themes of alienation and condemnation that had characterized Ameri- can Hebrew literature in its infancy. Outside the realm of belles-lettres, however, the trauma was less in evi- dence. In the sections devoted to research and criticism, the stress is on continuity, not breakdown. Intellectual concerns ranged from the religious philosophy of Franz Rosenzweig to Judaic liturgical development, and to Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism. Literary critics reviewed the work of Ephraim Lissitsky, Yosef Haim Brenner, Zalman Shneour, and Uri Zvi Greenberg. The American scene, too, remained an abiding concern. Jacob Les- tchinsky's essay, "Economic Development of American Jewry," was a summary of trends and occupational stratification that brought up to date the evaluations published in the 1930s.85 Rabbi A. Hefterman presented a gloomy picture of Jewish affiliation and identification in small- and medium-sized American cities, sounding a note of near-panic with regard to the galloping intermarriage rate.86 (This perception conflicts with the findings of social scientists gathered in the late 1940s and early 1950s.)87 other poems in the volume are "Shir kelot hakitzin" (p. 126), "Shir hanehamah" (p. 127), and "Demut tzel bevarshah" (pp. 128-129). 83.

It was, he said, time for a liter- ary awakening, for a new scholarship, and for new horizons in all fields of Jewish life. It would not do, he argued further, merely to return to ancient or tradi- tional forms. Harking back to the "futurist" and modernist themes he had expressed in 1927, he reaffirmed the cultural and even religious value of the new life to be created in Israel, and with it, the "new breed" of Jew who would emerge there.90 Ironically, then, it was Israel's national-military triumph that allowed Ribalow to return to the positive humanist-universalist ideas of twenty years earlier. The world had gone through an astonishing revolution in tech- nology and in social values, he declared. The new civilization was vastly dif- ferent from that of the nineteenth century. And we are part of this great humanity, caught up in the travails of servitude and liberation. . . . We are the children of this great world . .. with all its tragic conflicts and its awesome achievements .... "When God brought us back to Zion, it was as if we were in a dream." We dream about the glorious past that has been resurrected, and we dream about the future, our future and that of all the world. We want to pour all of our 2,000-year-long experience into our present lives. And we want the universalist understanding that we acquired in our years of being a world people ['am 'olam] to become the criterion of our new life in Israel and in the lands of our dispersion.9" As for the Hebrew language, new challenges awaited it.

How would Hebrew, as the language of an elite, be transformed as it became the language of the masses? What would be the impact of trends in Israel on creativity in the Diaspora, and- who knew?-what influence could the Diaspora writers bring to bear on Hebrew culture in Israel? Ribalow foresaw a fructifying symbiosis between the two, enriched by the youthful vigor of Israeli writing.92 The triumphalist tone of Ribalow's message was qualified by a con- tinued brooding on the great tragedy that the Jewish people had just gone through. Ephraim Lissitsky, for example, wrote on "Hitler Before the Seat of Judgment."93 A. S. Shvarts composed a narrative poem that alluded to traditional liturgy (on the Eileh Ezkerah model) to form an analogy between ancient and modern martyrs.94 And A. R. Malachi's essay on the chroniclers of the mass slaughter of Jews in Poland three hundred years earlier, during the Chmielnicki revolt of 1648-49, bore obvious relevance to the generation of the Holocaust.95 Perhaps most impressive of all, in this area, was a detailed essay on what has become known as Holocaust literature, that analyzed and quoted from Jewish poetry written in the ghettos and camps.96 The sum total for the last Yearbook was thus a mix of vindication and dejection. The open wounds of the Second World War could not be healed, but the establishment of the State of Israel was-against that background- so much more extraordinary and encouraging. In the years that followed, a number of Hebrew writers left America to make their home in Israel (notably Shimon Halkin, Israel Efros, Yohanan Twersky, Avraham Regelson, and Zalman Shneour). A number of others died during the 1950s (Menahem Ribalow, Nissan Touroff, Shmuel Simha Cohen, Herman Frank). Under the circumstances, the community that they had created around the Yearbook-many of them had contributed to more than one volume-fell apart.97 While less ambitious journals, including 92.

A piece of trivia that relates to the question of "community" among the American Hebraists is the fact that Zvi Scharfstein's son, Ben-Ami Scharfstein, married the daughter of Israel Efros, and settled in Israel in 1955. Ben-Ami Scharfstein taught philosophy at Tel-Aviv University, where Israel Efros, his father-in-law, was appointed the first rector in 1954.

Conclusion Those who have commented on Hebrew literature in America until now have tended to agree that it was an emigre literature; that its practitioners were raised (or at least born) in Europe, and, therefore, that it never suc- ceeded in developing indigenous roots in American culture. It remained a literature of alienation and marginality, lacking an understanding of Ameri- can realities and unable to connect with American literature as a whole. Hence, it did not last. I wish to take issue with the notion that it was a lack of alertness to the American scene that doomed Hebrew literature in America. I believe I have shown that this argument does not do justice to the degree of American influence on the agenda of American Hebrew writers. Nor is it clear that the stance of alienation and the fact of cultural mar- ginality would have prevented these writers from voicing something authen- tically American. For one thing, they were not the only "outsiders" in the literary world. Marginality as such is no bar to literary creativity or success, and there are some contemporary writers (even native-born American ones) who clearly find their inspiration in such situations. Cynthia Ozick has pointed out that, in her own mind, marginality coexists with at-homeness; she feels "perfectly at home [in America] and perfectly insecure... perfectly acculturated and perfectly marginal."98 Moreover, marginality was not something that Sefer hashanah cultivated: quite the opposite. More persuasive than the general "alienation" argument is the sugges- tion made by Robert Alter that Hebrew literature in America was always a sideshow, while the "main event" took place in Palestine-Israel.99 The fact that some of the leading Hebrew writers in America left for Israel during the 1940s and 1950s tends to bear out this thesis. Much more basic, however, is the fact that American Hebrew literature failed not because it could not communicate American ideas, but because 98. Ozick, "Toward a New Yiddish" p. 152. 99. Alter, "Inner Migration," p. 97.</page><page sequence="31">THE AMERICAN HEBREW YEARBOOK, 1930-1949 81 American Hebrew writers lacked a "market" of prospective readers. Their problem was not that they were poets of alienation, but that they were isolated by a semantic wall from their only potential public. That is why vir- tually none of them made their living primarily as writers. Hebraists in America wrote for themselves and to each other, not to a general public. Without a readership of any numerical significance, without critics, standards, without writing for theater or the cinema-the entire social framework that supports modern literary activity-Hebrew literature in America could never become self-sustaining. This was pointed out back in 1901 by Mordecai Raizin, and indicated by Nissan Touroff in the late 1930s. 00 Without a social context to work in, American Hebrew writers could not serve a social function. Thus, they became craftsmen dedicated to perpetuat- ing a lost art-which strongly implies a built-in obsolescence. Although they sensed that they had a mission to fulfill-to carry the torch of Hebrew letters that Russian Jewry was prevented from carrying any longer-it was not in America but in the Yishuv that the mission would one day come to fruition. When Israeli statehood was established, American Hebraists were relieved of a burden, in a sense, and could hand the torch on to others. Those most involved in the intimate world of American Hebrew letters did not quite see it that way, of course. Writing in 1949, the poet Hillel Bavli assessed the achievements and potential of Hebrew literature in the United States. As for the past, Bavli was rather positive, but he hedged when it came to projecting an optimistic future for Hebrew in American Judaism. "In a sense," he said, "Hebrew literature presents a challenge to American Israel. Whether this literature is to be a permanent, growing expression or merely a transitory episode depends largely upon the cultural and spiritual course American Jewish life will take in the future."'0' Menahem Ribalow, on the other hand, did not hesitate to forecast a great future for Hebrew in America. He believed in the possibility of a strong Diaspora culture-vigorous and inventive and authentic enough to hold its own in a genuine dialogue with European Jewry and (after the Holocaust) with Israel. It was not for nothing that one observer has called Ribalow "one of the great believers."'02 100.

If American Jewry is indeed the "people of the lost book," Sefer ha- shanah merits being placed on the bookshelf to remind us of what was and what might have been. Although short-lived, the phenomenon of American Hebrew literature has cultural and historical significance. Retrieving the message of the American Hebrew writers is one more way to retrieve the cul- tural interface that existed between American Jewry and European Jewry when American Jewry was still largely an immigrant community, and thus to illuminate for American Jews an important part of their own heritage.
