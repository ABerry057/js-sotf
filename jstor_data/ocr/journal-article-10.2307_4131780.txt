Jerusa- lem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2000. xxxvii, 514 pp. The title Medieval English Jews and Royal Officials whets the appetite for a rich exploration of the general policies of the English crown towards the Jews. What were the contradictions in royal policies from the Conquest to the expulsion, the relation between policy and implementation, and the capacity of the Jews to 122</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews parry injurious policies or to encourage more generous ones? Unfortunately, the book that addresses these issues in a sophisticated contemporary way still remains to be written. The subtitle of the book under review here, Entries of Jewish Inter- est in the English Memoranda Rolls, 1266-1293, more accurately defines its con- tent. Zefira Entin Rokeah calendars-that is, she provides summaries, para- phrases, and, very rarely, full translations of-the official notes of English gov- ernment clerks on matters related to royal finance. The number of surviving mem- oranda is immense. Those of Jewish interest constitute a miniscule proportion, but still come to 1329 entries in the years covered. "Of Jewish interest" is defined broadly. A debt left unpaid by a converted Jew and unrelated to his former Jew- ishness is of Jewish interest; a long list of outstanding obligations pertaining to a monastery or noble is of Jewish interest if one of those obligations ever had any- thing to do with a Jew. This broad definition helps to situate the Jews in the wider fiscal concerns of the English crown. The introduction to the volume is brief but serviceable. Scholars have writ- ten so much and so well on medieval English law and government that it is per- fectly reasonable for Rokeah to summarize what is known and refer the reader to specialized works. A notable feature of Rokeah's annotation is her description of the (bored?) government clerks' pictorial graffiti on the memoranda rolls-little pen drawings of scowling monks, disgruntled bishops and caricatured Jews that clutter the margins of the manuscripts. Unfortunately, but understandably since she has published elsewhere on these images, no representations are reproduced ex- cept for two on the cover of the book. The modern cover artist has taken the liber- ty of touching up these two with yellow in order to highlight in the one case the caricature of a Jew, the badge or tablets of the Law, and in the other, a drawing of the king, the gold of the crown. In fact, the drawings do not face each other in the original or even appear on the same roll. No artist, that is, actually expressed some sense of balance or counterpoint by means of color-coding Torah and Corona. The memoranda themselves are mostly routine: X, a Jew, owes such-and- such; Y brought a packet of Jewish bonds to the treasury for examination and needs reimbursement for his trip; Z purchased a house in the former Jewry of this-or- that town. As one reads through these monotonous records, one comes to recog- nize why the clerks doodled so much. Then, suddenly, a surprising entry will ap- pear. A touch of compassion (no. 181, year 1269): "Because impoverished Jews can be burdened beyond their resources concerning this fine unless it be assessed properly, the king [Henry III] orders that the richer Jews not be exempted from pay- ing their fair share and thereby over-burdening the poorer Jews." A hint of fear about the possible breakdown of civil order on the death of the king (no. 430, year 1272): The Christian debtor "should have paid the 36 marks to the Jew ... [and] had the money ready to pay, but the Jew was in hiding at the tower of London be- cause of the king's death." Even a surprising name (no. 528, year 1273): "Toni [in another manuscript memorandum of the same matter, Tony] son of Aaron, Jew." Finally, uncertainty whether the Jews were gone for good with the expulsion of 1290 (no. 1321, year 1293): "Should the aforesaid Jews return to England here- after (Et si contingetpredictos Judeos in Angliam in posterum redire) . . ." 123</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews With nuggets of information like these and with the routine but useful in- formation in most of the other memoranda, one can only lament the absence of a first-rate up-to-date book on the Jews of medieval England and their relations with the state. Rokeah's calendar will provide an invaluable resource for anyone who undertakes to write that book. Do it for Tony.
