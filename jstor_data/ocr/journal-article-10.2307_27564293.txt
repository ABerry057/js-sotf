Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says: anyone who has no mons veneris4 like women. R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: 1. The term 'aylonit lacks an English equivalent. Essentially, she is, as the Tosefta describes her, a woman who does not experience physical puberty even after reaching the appropriate age. 2. The literal translation of "np1? is "damaged." Lieberman understands it in context as "thin," derived from M. Nega'im 10:1, in which the word is clearly used as a parallel to the word pi, meaning "thin." He introduces the commentaries of Rashi, who defines it as "soft," and Rabbi Mena chem ben Shlomo, who defines it as "thin and very soft" (see Saul Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Tosefta [Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1995], 6:104). This word is also used to describe the voice of the seris hammah. Because the voice of the 'aylonit is described as thick and the description of the seris hammah is the mirror image of the 'aylonit, it seems likely that the word ip1? does indeed mean thin. 3. Rather than saying "has difficulty during sex," I intentionally use a colloquialism here, as I believe the use of the word "hard" conveys a possible wordplay, evoking the term 1?X37 TWpn, "to intentionally cause an erection" (see B. Niddah 13b, KR 2:8). See also this baraita as it appears in B. Yevamot 80b, which uses the form ntPpna, used elsewhere to describe an erection (see T. Shabbat 15:9; Y Shabbat 19:6, 17b; B. Shabbat 137b). Nevertheless, the plain meaning is "has difficulty," that is, she is not capable of "true" heterosexual sex. 4. The term wvn ^wip is elusive. Marcus Jastrow translates it literally as "the lower part of the abdomen" (A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Litera ture, with an Index of Scriptural Quotations [New York: Judaica Press, 1996], 1566). Others translate the term as mons veneris (see The Babylonian Talmud, ed. Isidore Epstein, trans. Israel W. Slotki 297</page><page sequence="2">Sarra Lev anyone whose voice is thick and is not distinguishable between a man['s]5 and a woman['s]. In this essay, I posit that the 'aylonit essentially receives her sex/gender assign ment from her parallel, the natural eunuch. I reach this conclusion by demon strating that the aggregate simanim (signs) of the 'aylonit are chosen specifically for their sex/gender-crossing attributes, fitting neither any known modem condition nor any ancient condition. Given that in the legal material the rabbis do not, in fact, understand the 'aylonit as a sex/gender crosser, the list of attributes seems to emerge from nowhere. The answer to the riddle of its origin is to be found in the text describing the seris hammah (the congenital eunuch, whose description parallels that of the 'aylonit in many ways). That is, the simanim of the seris hammah also present him as a sex/gender crossover despite the lack of supporting halakhic literature. But whereas the 'aylonit has no ancient corollary in the Greek and Roman literature, the attributes of the seris hammah directly match those of the Roman eunuch, who does appear in many of the contemporaneous Christian and Roman materials as a sex/gender crosser. It would seem, then, that the seris hammah shares his sex/gender with the Roman eunuch, and the 'aylonit receives her sex/gender from her mirror image, the seris hammah. What Do These Symptoms Represent? Throughout the past two millennia, beginning in the amoraic period, sages and scholars have debated whether the simanim attributed to the 'aylonit should be read as a comprehensive list describing a single condition or as a series of markers, each of which individually points to a condition of congenital infertility.6 The reason that this question has been asked thus far is a halakhic one, meant to deter mine how we should deal with individual women who present one or two of the [London: Soncino Press, 1961], Yevamot 80b, who also uses this translation for the term *p in B. Niddah 47b). 5. For an explanation of the two reading choices, see page 303. 6. Much of the halakhic literature reads the simanim as individual markers that each qualify a woman as an 'aylonit. This stringency understands all congenital infertility, not just one particular con dition, as grounds to qualify a woman as an 'aylonit. Any woman, whether she exhibited none, one, or all of the simanim, would qualify as an 'aylonit if she reached the age of twenty and bore no pubic hair. In most cases, this protects a male (who has the obligation to procreate) from ever incurring a penally if he accidentally marries a nonprocreative woman. This method of understanding a text in order to prevent all possible breaches of the halakhic system would be applied by later commentators and codi fiers to the case of the simanim that describe the bogeret as well (see M. Niddah 5:8). The case of a bogeret, however, differs in that the stringent point of view varies with regard to the particular issue being discussed (See Rashi, B. Niddah 47b, s.v. T?nnb). Although I disagree with his conclusions on the matter, Daniel Malakh offers an excellent summary of the arguments in his article "Be-Din Hag darat Seris Hammah Ve-'Aylonit," in Sefer Refa 'el: Ma 'amarim u-Mekhkarim Ba-Torah Uve-Mada 'e HaYahadut Lezikhro Shel Dr. Yitshak Refa'el, Zal, ed. Yosef Eliyahu Movshovits (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kuk, 2000). 298</page><page sequence="3">How the 'Aylonit Got Her Sex symptoms but not all of them. A number of halakhic issues depend on the answer to these questions: in what age bracket the 'aylonit is classified,7 whether a man who has an 'aylonit daughter is exempted from the commandment of procreation,8 whether a man must pay an 'aylonit her ketubah when divorcing her after remain ing childless,9 whether a man may remarry an 'aylonit after divorcing her,10 whether a rapist must pay a fine (kenas) for raping an 'aylonit,11 whether an 'aylonit engages in the ritual of the sotah,12 and whether a man is permitted to marry an 'aylonit altogether.13 But even apart from the halakhic questions that have concerned the poskim (legal decisors) over the centuries, determining what the rabbis were thinking or seeing when they described this particular category remains a historical knot that is worth unraveling, especially given the enigmatic nature of the description. In this section, I demonstrate that regardless of whether one sees the simanim as individual markers or as a set of symptoms all meant to describe a single condition, the only unifying principle in the list is that of sex/gender cross ing. Thus, it is possible to see the list as a collection of individual symptoms, each of which, combined with the original definition (reaching age twenty with no pubic hairs) describes a condition in and of itself. It is also possible to read the list as a whole as resembling a single medical condition. However, each of these readings, although feasible, presents its own difficulties. Ultimately, what is interesting about this group of symptoms is that they are united by a common theme, that of sex/gender crossing. I briefly examine (and discount) three possibi lities: that the symptoms describe one or more accepted ancient "conditions," that they describe a single medical condition known to us today, or that they describe a series of medical conditions known to us today.14 I reach the conclusion that none 7. Maimonides, Hilchot Ishut, 2:3-5; Maimonides, Hilchot Gerushin, 11:4. 8. Maimonides, Hilchot Ishut, 15:4. 9. Maimonides, Hilchot Ishut, 24:1-2, 7-8. The ketubah provides a woman with a guarantee that she will receive a certain minimum amount in the event that she is divorced or widowed. Under these circumstances, there are those who argue that a man should be released from this obligation, believing that the marriage was an "erroneous acquisition" (rntf? npft) of an infertile woman by an unsuspecting man. According to this opinion, this acquisition renders the man unable to fulfill the com mandment to "be fruitful and multiply." The fact that it was an erroneous acquisition renders the orig inal contract, and thus the ketubah, null and void. 10. Maimonides, Hilchot Gerushin, 10:13. 11. Maimonides, Hilchot Ne 'arah Betulah, 1:9. 12. Maimonides, Hilchot Sotah, 2:10-11. Whereas a "normal" woman would ordinarily be required to endure the ordeal of the sotah, the question arises as to whether the rabbis would wish to preserve a marriage to an 'aylonit, for whom there is no possibility of procreation. The goal of the ritual?to prove the woman's innocence and preserve the marriage?is called into question in this case. 13. Maimonides, Hilchot Ishut, 15:7. 14. From a literary structural point of view, it seems more feasible that the full list (excluding the two minority opinions) is a description of a single condition. Alternatively, it is possible that each of the simanim is meant to be considered individually, along with the definitive feature of a lack of pubic hairs. See my later discussion of the structure of the text. 299</page><page sequence="4">Sarra Lev of these three possibilities fully explains the list of simanim as we see it in the Tosefta. If we entertain the possibility, for a moment, that these simanim are intended to describe a commonly accepted ancient condition, we raise the question of what ancient condition(s) might parallel or reflect this particular group of symptoms. Nowhere in the legal literature, the fiction, the poetry, or the medical texts of the Roman pagans or Christians of the tannaitic period does the congenitally infer tile woman appear as a category, either with these descriptive characteristics or with others.15 Whereas the male counterpart of the 'aylonit, the seris hammah, is mentioned in a number of these texts16 and is assumed to exist in others, the 'aylonit, or any similar category of congenitally infertile woman, is absent. Even the medical literature of the time shows no signs that it recognizes such a category. Thus, it is unlikely that the rabbinic category parallels any existing Roman or Christian category or condition. Not only are the Tosefta's individual symptoms not paralleled in the contem poraneous ancient texts, but taken as a whole, the list of symptoms does not seem to add up to one particular contemporary syndrome or condition. Although some of the signs fall directly within the medical descriptions of certain conditions exist ing today, any one condition (whether it be hormonal, chromosomal, or otherwise) that would produce a few of the enumerated symptoms would not produce the entire list found in T. Yevamot 10:7. In addition, all of the medical conditions that might be said to elicit the symptoms of the 'aylonit produce a list of additional symptoms that the Tosefta does not include. Our best parallel to the condition that the Tosefta's combination of simanim describes is Turner syndrome. This syndrome occurs when only one X chromo some is present, and thus the ovaries do not develop normally or function fully.17 The condition affects 1 in 2,000 live female births.18 In a person with Turner syndrome, adequate amounts of female hormones are lacking, and the affected woman does not experience puberty (i.e., develop breasts and menstru ate). Pubic and axillary hair may grow, but not always. Having undeveloped ovaries also means that the woman is quite likely to be infertile, although there 15. Cf. Bernadette Brooten, who discusses female gender crossing and never once introduces the category of the woman whose body appears male-like in Love Between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996). The one exception appears in Aristotle's Generation of Animals 2.7, more than 300 years before the earliest date of this literature. Here, Aristotle notes that some women are born congenitally infertile, and he notes that they are masculine looking and do not enter puberty. 16. See Sarra Lev, "When Do Genitals Determine Sex? Rabbinic and Roman Concepts of the Congenital Eunuch," lecture presented at the Association of Jewish Studies Conference, December 20, 2005, Chicago. 17. Also possible (though with much fewer parallels) is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), in which the affected body does not develop hair and is often infertile but frequently does eventually develop breasts. Partial AIS bodies are often not infertile. The external genitals of an AIS body are female, although testes exist in the abdomen. 18. This makes it not only possible but probable that these rabbis had encountered this con dition, even if the statistics were somewhat different then. 300</page><page sequence="5">How the 'Aylonit Got Her Sex are rare cases of women with Turner syndrome conceiving children. Finally, there is an absence of normal moisture in the vagina, causing painful intercourse. Other symptoms include short stature, webbed neck, abnormal eye features, dry eyes, abnormal bone development (such as a broad, flat chest), and absent menstruation.

What is 301</page><page sequence="6">Sarra Lev also true, however, is that the last two simanim that describe the 'aylonit in the Tosefta (lack of mons veneris and deep voice or male-like qualities), those that are understood as the opinions of individual rabbis, are not in concert with the symptoms of Turner syndrome. The external appearance of the genitals, expressed in the name of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel as a "lack of mons veneris," would be unaffected if the 'aylonit were a case of Turner syndrome. Moreover, it is unli kely that the voice of an 'aylonit would become lower, like a male voice, rather than simply being "thin," like a girl's voice. In addition, a significant number of prominent symptoms of Turner syndrome are not mentioned by the Tosefta (lymphodema, short stature, webbed neck, abnormal eye features, broad chest, low-set ears, low hairline). Thus, the set of symptoms, taken as a whole, does not seem to correspond to any one condition known to us today. Finally, taken individually, the particular choice o? simanim seems similarly random. T. Yevamot 10:7 itself is divided into two parts, the first of which consti tutes the definition of an 'aylonit, directly asking and answering the question "who is an 'aylonitT (one who has not developed two hairs by a certain age). The second part of the text, which contains the list of simanim, is the description of the now defined 'aylonit. This division of the text into two sections is supported intertexrually by M. Niddah 5:9 and T. Niddah 6:2, in which the definition appears in very much the same language. Neither of these parallels, however, includes any of the simanim contained in T. Yevamot 10:7. It is quite likely that the list of simanim is separate from the definition of the 'aylonit and is not meant to classify but to further describe the already defined category of the congenitally infertile woman. If the list of simanim is meant to be read as a collection of individual markers of infertility, it would be necessary to read each of those markers in combination with the original definition (one who has no pubic hair at age twenty). This would require each of these combinations to constitute symptoms of congenital infertility. Although some of them do, in combination with a lack of pubic hair, constitute symptoms of such a condition, it is not clear that all of the simanim qualify. In addition, we are again faced with the problem that only a certain group is named in this text, whereas the conditions of congenital infertility that would include a lack of pubic hair also include a great many symptoms that are not found on this list. The question remains, then, why the list includes these symp toms and not others. The information thus far leaves us, then, with no logical origin for this particular list of simanim. The list reflects neither an ancient nor a modem medical condition known to us, whether we consider the list as individ ual markers of a series of conditions or as a list of symptoms of a single condition. Thus, we are in the position of needing to posit a different organizing principle for the choice o? simanim in the Tosefta's text. The Aylonit. A Sex/Gender Crossover? The Unifying Feature of the Simanim?Sex/Gender Crossing If the Tosefta text describes neither a known condition of the time nor a medical condition with which we are familiar, what might be the unifying factor behind the symptoms chosen by the Tosefta? The images describing the 302</page><page sequence="7">How the Aylonit Got Her Sex 'aylonit in T. Yevamot 10:7 are primarily images of a sex/gender crosser. That is to say, if the Tosefta's description is, in fact, of a woman with Turner syndrome, the symptoms enumerated are only those that create a sex/gender-crossing impression. The Tosefta does not, for example, indicate that this woman might also have a short stature, a webbed neck, or swollen hands. Even if these descriptions are intended to be taken individually, they are united by the feature of sex/gender crossover. The 'aylonifs genitals are specifi cally described as unlike "women's" genitals. In addition, regardless of whether it is the speaker's intention, the terms used to imply difficulty during sex (nwp?/nwpna) evoke images of an erect penis (ntf/pntt/iasy nwpft).19 Finally, the 'aylonifs voice is compared explicitly with that of a male. Altogether, these last three signs at first contrast the 'aylonit (who has "no mons veneris like women") with a "normal" woman, then compare her implicitly with a man through sexual imagery (pwpft), and finally compare her explicitly with a man (she is "not distinguishable between a man and a woman"). If we take this one step further, we note that although the Vienna manuscript offers a reading that compares the voice of the 'aylonit to that of a male, in the Erfurt manuscript of the Tosefta, the final comparison is not between the voices but between the 'aylonit herself and a man. The final line of the halakhah in the Erfurt manuscript reads, 7WX "pm wx l'a mm nrxi my rh^w W? ("whose voice is thick and it is not [possible to] discern whether she is a man or a woman"), rather than nra1? WN "pa m^ "pxi my nVipw ta ("whose voice is thick and it is not [possible to] discern whether it is [that of] a man or a woman"). In the Erfurt manuscript, the feminine verb points directly at the subject?the 'aylonit herself. The word kol (voice) is masculine, leaving only the possibility that the woman herself, and not the voice, is being described as having a sex/ gender that is unrecognizable. The 'Aylonit as Fully Female?The Halakhic Literature If T. Yevamot 10:7 is composed of a list of sex/gender-crossing images rather than a list of symptoms of a particular medical condition, then we must examine the origins of this particular view of the 'aylonit as sex/gender crosser. What is entirely evident is that the prescriptive21 texts involving the 'aylonit all treat her as fully female. Thus, the origins of the description of 'aylonit as sex/ gender crossover are not located in a more general tannaitic view of the 'aylonit as a figure who crossed sex/gender. That is, the authors of this descriptive text did not understand the 'aylonit to be in a legally ambiguous sex/gender category and did not intend to create or describe her using a list composed of elements that evoked those images. 19. See note 3. 20. Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fishutah, 6:33. 21.1 differentiate here between prescriptive texts, which dictate the laws concerning the 'aylonit (and the seris hammah), and descriptive texts, which simply define or describe the nature of the cat egory being discussed. Tannaitic texts that are descriptive often begin with the question?_inrx and proceed to explain the nature of the person or object being discussed. 303</page><page sequence="8">Sarra Lev The idea that the tannaitic rabbis saw certain bodies as sex/gender crossing is not unfamiliar to us. The most obvious case is the androgynus (one who possesses male and female genitalia), whose sex/gender classification is discussed at length in the halakhic material of the Tosefta. Given the rabbis' relegation of the andro gynus to a sex/gender-ambiguous category and their extensive discussion of the halakhic ramifications of this body, it is clear that they are not simply avoiding the subject of sex/gender crossing. It would not be far-fetched to assume, in the case of the androgynus, that any sex/gender-crossing descriptions of his/her body (even if they matched no known medical condition) might be written to evoke what they might think it would look like for a body to cross sex/gender.22 In contrast to the androgynus, however, nowhere else in the tannaitic litera ture, in any of the rulings concerning the 'aylonit, is the question of her sex/gender classification discussed or even implied. M. Sotah 4:3, for example, forbids the 'aylonit (along with other nonreproductive women) to vindicate herself and return to her marriage after being suspected of adultery. R. Eliezer disagrees with the ruling, however, saying, "he can marry a different woman [in addition to her] and reproduce through her." His response is predicated on the understand ing that the rabbis will not allow her to return to her marriage because she is incap able of enabling her husband to fulfill his commandment to reproduce, and not because she is the "wrong" sex/gender. His response is, essentially, that the husband can fulfill that obligation elsewhere and that the 'aylonit should be per mitted to return to the marriage if she is innocent. The issue here is not her mar riageability as a woman but rather her ability to enable the husband to fulfill his reproductive responsibility.23 Similarly, while M. Ketubot 11:6 refuses to grant a ketubah to an 'aylonit, the second half of the Mishnah explains that if he married her knowing she was an 'aylonit, she does, in fact, receive a full ketubah, and T. Ketubot 1:3 confirms this reading, stating, "minD p1? t?k mib^x mxim rrvvn wnv nptm mvn "?if she is married as if she is valid and rums out to be an 'aylonit, she receives no ketubah. Again, this implies that the reason she would not receive a ketubah hinges on a "mistaken acquisition" rather than the fact that her sex/gender renders her inappropriate to marry a male. In the two dozen or so halakhic texts having to do with the 'aylonit in tan naitic literature, nowhere does she ever seem to be considered anything but a full fledged female. All the laws regarding the 'aylonit seem to treat her as a "normal" 22. Unfortunately, no descriptions of the androgynus whatsoever can be found in the tannaitic literature. Thus, we have nothing on which to base a comparison between a figure who is clearly regarded as a sex/gender crosser in the halakhic material and one who is not. 23. Moreover, even given her status as nonreproductive, there is a discussion in the tannaitic material about whether, as is the case with a "normal" woman, she should be required to wait three months before remarrying. This discussion almost assumes that there is always the potential for repro duction, even in an 'aylonit (T. Yevamot 6:6). In contrast, the Mishnah and Talmud (B. Yevamot 33b, 34b-35a) rule on a similar case in which a minor girl who is mistakenly exchanged for her sister is permitted to immediately return to her husband after mistaken illegal sex because she is not considered in danger of having conceived a mamzer (a child born of illicit sexual relations). 304</page><page sequence="9">How the Aylonit Got Her Sex woman, albeit a nonreproductive one. Altogether then, the origins of her assign ment to an ambiguous sex/gender in the descriptions of her body cannot be said to emerge from an overriding rabbinic view of the 'aylonit as a sex/gender cross over. Why, then, would the rabbis describe her in terms that evoke sex/gender crossing? The Seris Hammah: A Sex/Gender Crossover? If the description of the 'aylonit as sex/gender crosser emerges neither from the rabbis' general understanding of her body nor from any ancient or modem con dition, from where does it emerge? The origins of the 'aylonifs "sex" may be found not in the texts regarding the 'aylonit herself but in those regarding the seris hammah, her (male) mirror image. More than half of the two dozen texts that concern the seris hammah are preceded or followed by texts that concern the 'aylonit, inextricably linking the two categories. Of these texts, many are direct mirror images of one another: M. Yevamot 8:5, for example, reads, "naaTio nVi nxVin vh mT&gt;K pi urn n1?! f^in vb onon" ("The saris does not do halizah or yibbum and so too the 'aylonit does not do halizah or yibbum"). The fact that the two are mirror images not only allows but also requires us to view the two categories in light of one another. The Seris Hammah as Fully Male?The Halakhic Literature Like the 'aylonit, the saris does not present a halakhic question of sex/ gender indeterminacy for the rabbis. It is true that he appears in lists that place him in the same halakhic category with women; for example, hair afflicted with leprosy (zara 'at) that appears on his face is treated the same as hair on the face of a woman rather than like hair on the beard of a man. Like those laws concerning the 'aylonit, however, these laws can always be explained more effectively in ways that do not call on sex/gender crossing. In this case, the facial skin of a seris hammah and that of a woman are both usually smooth. Thus, both smooth areas are considered halakhically similar. The hair on his face is not being com pared to that on a woman's face in order to effeminize him but simply because the hair on their faces is equally uncommon and could be a sign of leprosy. Similarly, the fact that the seris hammah may not engage in the act oiyibum or halizah cannot be because he is not considered a man. He is permitted, as is any other man, to engage in a standard marriage to any woman. Thus, the fact that he is not permitted to perform the particular marital acts oiyibum is attributable to his congenital infertility and his inability to carry on the line of his brother as these rituals demand rather than being a result of a sex/gender crossover. Finally, like a "normal" male, the seris hammah is permitted to blow the shofar and exempts other males from the obligation. Likewise, he exempts other males from the reading of the megillah and from saying the prayer after the meal. The fact that he not only has an obligation to perform these command ments but also exempts the "normal" male from doing so places him squarely in the category of "normal male" himself. Thus, the prescriptive texts that concern the seris hammah universally regard him as nothing "less than" a male. 305</page><page sequence="10">Sarra Lev All in all, we have here three examples of how the rabbis legally regard the seris hammah as fully male in the prescriptive texts. The only ways in which he is treated differently from other men come as a direct result of his physical differences ?in one case, his smooth skin, and in the other, of his physical inability to carry on the genetic line of his brother. Nowhere in these texts (or in any other prescrip tive texts) is there a question as to the sex/gender of the seris hammah, which is particularly demonstrated by the last text, in which it is entirely clear that the seris hammah can, like other "full males," exempt his "fellow males" from certain commandments. The Unifying Feature of the Simanim?Gender Crossing (and the Roman World) Like the 'aylonit, we have seen that the prescriptive texts do not call into question the sex/gender of the seris hammah in any way whatsoever. Also like the 'aylonit, the only text that describes the saris defies the norm set by the pre scriptive texts. That is, unlike the laws concerning him, the actual description of the saris is inundated with gender-crossing references, relegating him to the category of "not quite male" in a variety of ways. What we see in this section, however, is that, unlike the 'aylonit (whose simanim matched neither any known contemporary nor ancient description), the simanim of the seris hammah do seem to correspond to another paradigm. T. Yevamot 10:6 reads as follows: p^a "inxb&gt; ionnw s"yx nraw tiw x"on xbn r\w anizra nnu/w bo nan ono Kin nt w bwb&gt;m p iiyaw pi p^na vws\ pr ib&gt; iww bo vwo p ib&gt;w nm bob&gt; onoa Kin nn pb&gt;ri "Tra ]ww bo 'aw un nimm rb&gt;ya T&gt;b&gt;n 'Tra "pxw bo -iw in mirr 'n awa bom bo 'aw annx noo nuny tiww bo 'aw tm xrm wit nnaww bo 'w um "pirana na^ iwi ^pb&gt; ibnpw bo 'aw -i?yb&gt; p iraw 'i bon nb&gt;ya "nuo ]wi n^mn nia^a pisa nwxb&gt; ww ra Who is a sens hammah?

Eleazar says: Anyone whose voice is thin24 and is not distinguishable from a woman['s]. All in all, the totality of the list of descriptions of the seris hammah, like those of the 'aylonit, does not seem to match any known medical condition. Also like the 'aylonit, what unites the list of descriptions of the seris hammah is that each item 24. See note 2. 306</page><page sequence="11">How the Aylonit Got Her Sex on the list calls on gender as the overall descriptive lens through which these char acters are viewed, as I shall explain. Because there is no indication whatsoever that this lens was carried through in the tannaitic halakhic material concerning these cat egories (that is, there is no indication that the rabbis considered the seris hammah anything but fully male when considering what laws apply to him), we must again ask the question, "why do the rabbis describe these categories in terms of gender?" But in contrast to the 'aylonit, for the seris hammah, this question can be answered by returning to the Roman literature on the eunuch. Whereas the seris hammah in the rabbinic literature outside this text (the prescriptive texts) is divested of any gender-anomalous qualities whatsoever, the eunuch of the Roman period is often discussed as a gender crosser.25 Philostratus describes Favorinus the eunuch as one who is "double-sexed," or crosses gender: He was born double-sexed, a hermaphrodite,26 and this was plainly shown in his appearance; for even when he grew old he had no beard; it was evident too from his voice which sounded thin, shrill, and high-pitched, with the modulations that nature bestows on eunuchs also ... He used to say in the ambiguous style of an oracle that there were in the story of his life these three paradoxes: Though he was a Gaul he led the life of a Hellene; a eunuch [eunouchous] he had been tried for adultery; he had quarreled with an Emperor and was still alive.27 The fact that the characteristics by which Favorinus is described are identical to those of a seris hammah opens the possibility that the rabbis fed from a prevailing cultural understanding of bom (or castrated) eunuchs and their characteristics, one of which was their nonmale gender. This would serve as an explanation of the rab binic description of the seris hammah. The very clear parallel between the Roman and Christian understandings of the eunuch's characteristics and the description of the seris hammah in the Tosefta can be demonstrated through a closer look at the list of characteristics pre sented in the Tosefta. The most obvious reference to the fact that the body of the seris hammah is not male directly compares his voice (or his body) to that of a woman. The subject of R. Simeon's comment "and is not distinguishable" is unclear in this text, and it is difficult to know whether the text means to tell us that the voice itself is unrecognizable as a male voice or whether the seris hammah himself is unrecognizable as a male. Recalling the two versions of the 25. Unfortunately, many of the Roman texts conflate the born eunuch with the castrated male, making it difficult to differentiate the attitudes toward the two. At the same time, however, this confla tion reflects the way in which the Romans, unlike the rabbis, did not usually (and there are a few excep tions) differentiate between the two categories. 26. The translation "hermaphrodite" may be misleading, as the Greek term av?po9r|ta)? (androth?lys) is literally a combination of "male" and "effeminate." Though Philostratus uses both this term and s?vo?xouc (eunouchous), he quotes Favorinus as referring to himself as a eunuch. The very fact that this refers to a born eunuch rather than a castrated male may explain the introduction of this separate term. 27.

Wilmer Cave Wright (New York: Putnam, 1922), 8.489. 307</page><page sequence="12">Sarra Lev same statement with regard to the 'aylonit in T. Yevamot 10:7, either one is poss ible. Suffice it to say, however, that whichever way one reads this last line, the lack of maleness of the seris hammah is directly pointed at, either by his voice or by his entire being. It is essential to note that even if the foregoing text refers strictly to the voice of the seris hammah, the voice in Roman literature was considered indicative of gender categorization. Apuleius describes a group of eunuchs who were about to receive a gift as raising "a discordant shout with their cracked shrill effeminate voices."28 Regarding both Apuleius 's Metamorphoses and Lucian's Lucius, or the Ass, J. L. Lightfoot notes that this "is in fact characteristic of the way classical sources represent effeminate speech."29 In medical writings as well, the associ ation between voice and gender is made clear. Galen, for example, concentrates on the voice as a marker of appropriate sex categorization: That is to say, when the generative parts first swell out and the voice becomes rougher and deeper?for this is what puberty is?Hippocrates bids us observe which of the parts is the stronger; for of course, those that swell out first and have a greater growth are the stronger.30 The text of the Tosefta points to gender crossing in other ways that correspond to the Roman view of the gendered body as well. The description "anyone who bathes in the cold during the rainy days and whose flesh does not produce steam" is a see mingly enigmatic criterion by which to identify the seris hammah. However, the Roman literature again illuminates this statement by revealing that one of the funda mental differences between the male and the female body was that the male was hot, whereas the female was cold.31 A cold female body jumping into a cold river on a cold day, therefore, would not, of course, produce steam. A warm male body, pre sumably, would. Like a female body, the seris hammah's body jumping into the cold water does not produce steam. The seris hammah is labeled as female because of its temperature, a distinctly Greco/Roman understanding of the human body. The fact that one may judge a person to be a seris hammah by whether he produces steam jumping into cold water on a cold day becomes a test of his sex rather than his procreative power. Yet a third gender crossing of the seris hammah in the Tosefta lies in the descrip tion of this body as hairless. To begin with, the very feature by which he is defined is his lack of (presumably pubic) hair. In the description of the seris hammah, the theme of hairlessness is developed further, emphasizing that the seris hammah has no beard and that his skin is smooth. In contemporary terms, this might allude to a gender 28. Apuleius, Metamorphoses, trans. J. Arthur Hanson (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989), 8.26. 29. J. L.

Once again, however, a look at Roman texts of the period reveals that hairlessness held more weight as a description of femaleness or femininity than it would in contemporary culture. Note, for example, this description of the difference between men and women offered by Clement of Alexandria: This, then, the mark of the man, the beard, by which he is seen to be a man, is older than Eve, and is the token of the superior nature. In this God deemed it right that he should excel, and dispersed hair over man's whole body. Whatever smoothness and softness was in him He abstracted from his side when He formed the woman Eve, physically receptive, his partner in parent age, his help in household management, while he (for he had parted with all smoothness) remained a man, and shows himself man. And to him has been assigned action, as to her suffering; for what is shaggy is drier and warmer than what is smooth. Wherefore males have both more hair and more heat than females, animals that are entire than the emasculated, perfect than imperfect [sic]. This text not only draws a connection between body and facial hair and the male body but also between hair and heat, associating both with perfection and divest ing them from the imperfect female body or, in our case, the body of the eunuch (in this text, the castrated male). All in all, the seris hammah is portrayed as nonmale, or female, primarily by virtue of the Roman understanding of the way in which sex and gender reveal them selves and are controlled by specific biological factors in the human body.33 This differentiates the seris hammah from the 'aylonit. Whereas the description of the 'aylonit seems to emerge from nowhere, that of the seris hammah is anchored in a tradition of viewing the eunuch as a gender crosser, and his description shares many of the images that the Roman texts use to refer to female bodies. Parallels Between the Seris Hammah and the 'Aylonit To return to the original question of this essay, if the 'aylonit does not appear as a gender crosser in the rabbinic halakhic literature and appears nowhere in the Roman literature, or in contemporary medical texts with this list of symptoms, from where does the 'aylonit derive her sex/gender indeterminacy? If the 'aylonit is a woman with Turner Syndrome, why did the rabbis choose only those characteristics of the condition that portrayed her as a sex/gender crossover? And why did the two minority opinions portray her with characteristics that do not match those of Turner Syndrome? If the symptoms each describe separate con ditions that entail congenital infertility, why did the rabbis choose primarily 32. Clement of Alexandria, Pedagogus, 3.3.19.2. 33. In addition to all the specifically Roman references to sex/gender, it also seems logical to assume that the inability to urinate in an arch may have the same gendered quality as a description. The fact that men can urinate in an arch, whereas women cannot, may be yet another reference to the seris hammah's inability to enact his masculinity. 309</page><page sequence="14">Sarra Lev those symptoms that describe sex/gender crossing? What drove the rabbis to see this woman as a sex/gender crossover in their descriptions, even though there was no other evidence in the medical world, the ancient Roman world, or their own halakhic texts to support this perception? The answer lies in the parallels between the seris hammah and the 'aylonit themselves. As I pointed out earlier, the 'aylonit and the seris hammah are mirror images of one another. It is virtually impossible to consider one without consider ing the other. One notices, for example, that the 'aylonit is defined as the mirror image of the seris hammah?as a woman who has lived for twenty years without developing pubic hair. Thus, if the seris hammah is seen as a Roman eunuch (who is viewed in the ancient world as a nonmale), how could the 'aylonit not be seen in some way as the female counterpart of the seris hammah?a nonwoman? The 'aylonit essentially inherits her sex from the seris hammah. Although there is no explicit evidence for this theory, there are simanim. Take, for example, the parallels between the description of the seris hammah and that of the 'aylonit. As I have demonstrated, the description of the 'aylonit reads as a list of characteristics by which she can be shown to be a nonwoman. But the list is not divested from that of the characteristics of the seris hammah, though it is significantly shorter. The following chart demonstrates the correlations between the two descriptions.

In addition, the literary mirroring of the two texts (characteristics which defy "proper woman hood" are marked in bold and those that defy "proper manhood" in italics) also provides indications that these texts were composed as a set, whether one emerged from the other or whether they were composed together. What follows is a brief outline comparing the two texts. Like the text regarding the seris hammah, the text about the 'aylonit begins with an anonymous description of her secondary sex characteristics: The seris hammah has no beard (a prominent sex characteristic of the typical male), whereas the 'aylonit has no breasts (the most obvious secondary sex characteristic of the typical female). The second characteristic, damaged or thin hair, is enigmatic in the 'aylonit text, but it is understandable within the context of a parallel structure. Just as the seris hammah is described as having smooth (that is, unhairy) skin, she is described in terms of her hair. Because, by definition, she does not develop pubic hair, the text cannot describe her as hairy, as would be natural for a gender crosser. Thus, the ambiguous term lpb&gt; is employed. The same term, 1pb&gt;, is used later in the description of the seris hammah as well, though in a different context, with regard to his voice. The seris hammah text begins, at this point, with a list of minority opinions, beginning with that of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. The first two of these opinions move the description from the secondary sex characteristics to discuss the proper functioning of the primary male sexual organ?the penis. Whereas the previous characteristics concerned parts of the body that are easily viewed by the general public, the primary sexual organs are gen erally concealed. The text thus moves from the visible to the invisible (at least when discussing the clothed body). These first two minority opinions describing the seris hammah specifically note the damaged quality of the urine emanating from the penis, and both are somewhat enig matic.35 The text regarding the 'aylonit has no parallel symptoms describing anomalies in her urine or urination. The next parallel occurs following the two descriptions of the urination of the seris hammah, when the description rums to sexual (or procreative) perform ance, claiming that KITH itfl?, his semen "repels" (understood by some commentators to refer to its watery quality). This is paralleled by the third and final "majority opinion" of the 'aylonit text?that she "has trouble" during 34.1 concede that it is always possible to categorize in a myriad of ways and that this particular characterization of what each stage of the texts are doing may not, in fact, have been their intent. Never theless, it is impossible to ignore the correlations that exist between the two texts. 35.1 have found nothing in the Greek or Roman medical or philosophical literature to account for these particular characteristics, although it is probable, given the other evidence, that they originate in that thought system. 312</page><page sequence="17">How the Aylonit Got Her Sex sex. Neither the 'aylonit nor the seris hammah are sexually functional in their capacity as male or female. At this point, both texts focus again on the primary sex characteristics. The seris hammah text returns to a description of the nonfunctioning penis. Again, unlike "normal men" (and perhaps more like women who do not urinate standing), the eunuch does not form an arch when urinating.37 At the same time, the 'aylonit text, too, turns next to a description of her sexual organs, which are unlike those of "normal women." In addition?and again parallel to the seris hammah text? the first named rabbi in the list is Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. The opinion of R. Simeon ben Gamaliel here describes her genitals and explains how they are unlike the genitals of a normal woman. So, too, his comment referring to the genitals of the seris hammah relates how they are unlike those of a normal man?that is, they do not produce the liquid that a normal man would produce?yet another parallel. Finally, both texts end with the opinion of R. Simeon b. Eleazar, who, in each text, comments on voices. In T. Yevamot 10:6, he describes the voice of the seris hammah as "damaged," understood to mean thin or high by most com mentators, in direct contrast to the voice of the 'aylonit, which he describes in T. Yevamot 10:7 as thick, meaning low. Both texts end with the line, "and he/ she is not distinguishable from a female/male," leaving the reader with the over arching message?these categories are gender crossers. Clearly, the descriptions of these two characters intersect, overlap, and mirror one another structurally, linguistically, and thematically. In addition, the same named rabbis appear in both texts, and they are concerned with identical features of the two categories (Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel with the genitals and R. Simeon b. Eleazar with the voice). The connections between the texts are impossible to ignore. Tying Up Loose Ends Two questions remain to be answered regarding this theory: 1. Why is it that, if the seris hammah and 'aylonit are viewed (and thus described) as gender crossers, the halakhic literature does not reflect this fact? 2. If the description of the seris hammah parallels that of the Roman eunuch, and there is no Roman parallel to the 'aylonit, why do the rabbis discuss/create this category? The second question is more simple to answer than the first. Given the halakhic issues that the category of "congenitally infertile woman" raises, it is easy to see why the category of 'aylonit would have been necessary for the rabbis. Most notably, because a male is required to procreate, it would be incum bent on the rabbis to determine whether he would be permitted to marry a woman who is congenitally incapable of procreation, as well as to further explore the other 36. This may also allude to gender crossing (see note 3). 37. This is a possible allusion to Hypospadias. Although this text could refer to semen, the version of the baraita found in B. Yevamot 80b reads, HDO nuns; "pin u*n b^?&amp;n bo UHim Wl. The usual term for dysfunction of the penis with regard to sexual matters is pro mv IPX?"he does not shoot like an arrow." 313</page><page sequence="18">Sarra Lev issues regarding congenital infertility. Thus, the creation of this category is no sur prise. Once invented, it is entirely logical that the congenitally infertile woman would be described as the mirror image of the seris hammah, the congenitally infertile male, who conforms to the description and understanding of the Roman eunuch. Only a short leap is required to describe the 'aylonit as a gender-crossing woman?the direct parallel to the already existing Roman cat egory of congenital eunuch (seris hammah). Thus, although the 'aylonit is an anomaly in the Roman pagan and Christian literature of the rabbinic period, she derives her gender-crossing identity directly from the existing male equivalent, the seris hammah. The first question is, if the rabbis saw the body of the eunuch/'seris hammah in the same way as the Romans and Christians?in other words, as a gender-cross ing body?why did they not treat it thus halakhically? That is to say, why do the prescriptive texts regarding the seris hammah and the 'aylonit differ so greatly from the descriptive texts? The lack of concern for the gender crossing of the eunuch is clearly not a reflection of the rabbis' ambivalence toward gender anomalies. On the contrary, as I have shown, the rabbis are indeed engaged in a dis course of ambiguous gender in their discussions of the androgynus and the tumtum. The answer to this question lies, I believe, in the rabbinic enterprise as a whole. What must be said about the tannaitic model in general is that it is highly concerned with the determination of boundaries and categories through the use of those elements that lie on the edges and defy "normal" categorization.38 If the concern with gender is prevalent throughout the rabbinic literature, surely the eunuch would be just such a character, seemingly neither fully male nor fully female. In our case, however, that very character?one who lies between the categories of male and of female?already exists for the rabbis in the body of the androgynus (the hermaphrodite) and of the tumtum (the sexually indetermi nate person) rather than in that of the eunuch. An entire chapter of Mishnah/ Tosefta is devoted to determining the sex/gender of the androgynus,39 and a majority of the halakhic discourse surrounding the androgynus and the tumtum is concerned with halakhot having to do with one's biological sex.40 That the 38. See, e.g., Jacob Neusner, Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 238; and idem, "Sifra and the Problem of the Mishnah," Henoch XI (1989): 25-26. 39. Some understand this chapter (M. Bikkurim, chap. 4, which is equivalent to T. Bikkurim, chap. 2) to be a later addition to Mishnah added from the material of the Tosefta. See H. L. Strack and G. Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud andMidrash, 2nd ed., trans, and ed. Markus Bockmuehl (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1996), 121; and Order Zeraim, vol. I, Mishnayot, 2nd ed., trans. Philip Blackman (New York: Judaica Press, 1964), 463. 40. Here again, not a great deal has been written on the topic of gender crossings. See, however, W.

That gray area of gender ambiguity is represented by the bodies of the androgynus and the tumtum. The gray area that still needs to be represented in the rabbinic dis cussion is that of congenital infertility, particularly with regard to levirate mar riage, which requires procreation.41 The rabbis use the seris hammah to "think with," in the words of Daniel Boyar?n. They are less concerned with the gender crossing of that particular body and more concerned with positioning that body as a foil against which to discuss a particular issue. All in all, then, it is understandable both why the rabbis chose not to concern themselves halakhically with the perceived gender crossing of the seris hammah and the 'aylonit and why they chose to describe them in this particular fashion? the seris hammah because of his direct parallel with his Roman equivalent and the 'aylonit because of the mirroring of her counterpart. Conclusions This essay has examined several issues with the intent of understanding the origins of the description of the 'aylonit in the Tosefta, and it has posited the following: 1. That the description of the 'aylonit is composed almost entirely of gender-crossing images 2. That these images alone do not represent any known medical conditions 3. That these images alone do not correlate to any known contemporaneous Roman characterization of congenital infertility in a woman 4. That these images do not relate in any way to the way in which the tan naitic rabbis treat the 'aylonit in the halakhic literature, in which she is never seen as a gender crossover 5. That, in contrast to the 'aylonit, the (similarly gender-crossing) symp toms of the seris hammah parallel those of the eunuch in contempora neous Roman descriptions 6. That the 'aylonit is treated by the tannaitic rabbis as a mirror image of the seris hammah My conclusions from these observations are that the (gender-crossing) sex of the 'aylonit, as understood in her description in the Tosefta, emerges not 41. The law of levirate marriage requires the brother of a dead man to marry the widow of his childless dead brother, thereby providing his brother with his own (substitute) bloodline. Marriage to one's brother's widow would be forbidden under any other circumstances, thus making it imperative that the only enactment ofthat marriage is for the purpose of procreation. A congenitally nonprocreative male, then, exists in a gray area within the law. The rabbis must determine whether to include him within the proscription against this type of marriage or within the requirement to fulfill this duty of the living brother. 315</page><page sequence="20">Sarra Lev from her own body but from the mirror text describing her counterpart, the seris hammah.
