Elements of Ancient Jewish Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. xvi, 260 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001220 A wide consensus in research and usage connects the terms "nation" and "nationalism" to the emergence of the nation-states in modern Europe; many see the nation as a core of the modern experience. When David Goodblatt presents as "nationalist" many of the political, cultural, and religious developments within Second Temple Judaism, up to roughly the second century CE, it may at first appear as heretical. Moreover, such a thesis recalls Doron Mendels's The Rise and Fall of Ancient Jewish Nationalism,1 which was widely criticized for its sweeping generalizations. Mendels equated "ethnicity" with "nationalism" for "convenience." He described the symbolic meaning of Judean political institutions of the Second Temple period, especially those that happen to have counterparts in contemporary political discourse: the Temple, the land, the king, and the army of Judea. Goodblatt, for his part, notes Mendels's conflation of terms, and, after a detailed discussion of the theoretical implications, equally decides to use the terms "ethnicity" and "national identity" interchangeably (14). Goodblatt, however, emphasizes the imagined and propagandistic character of ancient national symbols and focuses on the dissemination of political ideas to the masses in an attempt to unify a state. Given that political propaganda and mass ideology are indeed elements of most definitions of nationalism, it becomes clear that Goodblatt's application of modern theory to ancient texts goes far beyond that of Mendels. Goodblatt's own examples are the large-scale publication of scripture to the illiterate masses, the propagandistic importance of the Hebrew language for Jewish speak ers of Greek and Aramaic, the influential politics of exclusivist priestly ideals, and the fundamental importance of the ethnic and geographic epithets "Israel," "Judah," and "Zion." Hedged against overreaching by the "elements" in the book's title, these examples mainly come from Goodblatt's own earlier work; at the same time, he derives them perceptively from Jewish political discourse of the Second Temple period. The nuanced discussions treat epigraphic, numismatic, and literary evidence, mostly under careful consideration of potential counterargu ments. Goodblatt's writing is always accessible, and his detailed approach com monsensical. There are a few inaccuracies (e.g., in the presentation of rabbinic sources) and editorial mistakes (e.g., the useful German neologism Nazionalit?t, 6), none with greater consequence for the argument. 1. Doron Mendels, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Jewish Nationalism (New York: Doubleday, 1992). 397</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews The first and last chapters of the book present Goodblatt's methodology, which gives much space for Benedict Anderson's notion of "imagined commu nities." Goodblatt claims that the reflected double conflation of nationalism and ethnicity, and of these terms' meanings in the ancient and modern worlds, may enhance our understanding of ancient Judaism. He thereby retreats from theoreti cal distinctions made by two of his interlocutors: Shaye Cohen's Beginnings of Jewishness and Seth Schwartz's Imperialism and Jewish Society. Goodblatt's choice allows him to reevaluate and integrate into his argument a broad amount of evidence; his results demand attention from those who continue considering his extrapolation of the term "nationalism" as idiosyncratic. Still, Goodblatt's stra tegic simplicity equally turns out to be the book's greatest liability. This becomes clear, for example, when Goodblatt engages Cohen or Schwartz directly. In one example, Goodblatt attacks Cohen's identification of the formulation of Judean self-identity in II Maccabees as increasingly religious. In Goodblatt's understand ing, a religious identity should be separable from birth. Therefore, he considers the fact that the impious high priest mentioned in II Maccabees is not explicitly stripped of his Judean-ness as sufficient grounds for a challenge to Cohen (20). Such an argument not only comes from silence but also glosses over Cohen's aggregative concept of the term "Judean." Similarly, in the final chapter, Goodblatt challenges Schwartz's decision not to use the idea of "nation" and its derivatives explicitly. Rather than addressing Schwartz's main argument of seeing Jewish cor porate identity through the eyes of Roman imperial identity, Goodblatt chooses to defer to an unspecified future date any comparison between Jewish and Roman (or even Ptolemaic or Seleucid) "nationalism" of the time. This deferral presupposes that one actually can understand Hasmonean politics without considering how it relates to that of their neighbors, small and large. While some may not share this presupposition, Goodblatt's contributions remain weighty and should be taken into consideration by any further studies on the political world of Second Temple Judaism. In Chapter 2, Goodblatt begins his historical survey by considering the role of the emerging Hebrew Bible in the creation of Jewish ethnic coherence. Based on Philip R. Davies's and E. Theodore Mullen's suggestions that several biblical books were created in an effort of "ethnogenesis," Goodblatt applies this insight to the circulation of biblical books. He weighs the common illiteracy in Judea and the lack of evidence for regular Torah readings outside Jerusalem and before the first century against the high number of biblical books found from the later Second Temple period. The persuasiveness of Goodblatt's argument may be dimin ished by his silence on how exactly he weighs his evidence; and his suggestion to generalize the early Roman manuscript evidence as far back as into the Achemenid period (48) remains tenuous. However, Goodblatt's intriguing and well-documented conclusion that the public recitation and veneration of scripture was a major tool in creating the ethnic coherence that scripture itself evokes remains persuasive. 2.

He concludes that "writing in Hebrew was a choice taken in pursuit of national continuity with pre-exilic Israel, whether real or imagined," (65) even though and precisely because Aramaic was a more widely used language throughout Palestine. Good blatt rightly points to the dominance of Hebrew in the Temple and its entourage and notes the status of Hebrew in rabbinic literature briefly, with the necessary sus picion as to the factual value of rabbinic dicta. Regrettably, I could not find any regard given to the language of the Mishnah as historical evidence in and of itself, or to Edward Y. Kutscher 's pertinent suggestion that the (Galilean) Mishnah attests to Hebrew as a language continuously spoken in Judea at least until the Bar Kokhba revolt. In this scenario, Hebrew may have been more of a fact of Judean life and less of the type of "choice" on which Goodblatt builds much of his valuable argument. Fortunately, Goodblatt partially substitutes for the potential impact of the mishnaic evidence by discussing Hannah Cotton's and Hanan Eshel's work on the Hebrew in late Judean documents. Chapter 4 traces the influence of priestly ideals on Jewish ethnic coherence. Goodblatt points to the priestly notion of "no lord but God" and to examples of priestly "zeal" as constitutive factors of struggles for Jewish autonomy. In the meantime, Martha Himmelfarb3 shows how priestly ideals were not only a com pelling symbol of religious and ethnic coherence, but also a factor which compli cated tremendously any Jewish implementation of a functioning corporate organization. Himmelfarb's work bears great potential to enhance Goodblatt's thesis, while Goodblatt simultaneously highlights the ancient political impli cations of Himmelfarb's findings. Finally, the three remaining chapters consider the symbolic power of the three terms "Israel," "Judah," and "Zion," respectively, perhaps Goodblatt's most powerful contributions. True, literature abounds on the history, etymology, and even semantics of these terms, and their importance in the political and reli gious struggles throughout antiquity is as obvious as their potential cultural affi nity to each other. Yet it seems that the obviousness has blinded some scholars to the tension between these symbols. Goodblatt manages to analyze some of the dynamics of Jewish history through the epithets chosen by some of its makers. In short, Goodblatt shows how the Hasmonean dynasty adopted a "Judean" identity, which it derived from a long-standing biblical and extra-biblical tradition of the concepts called "Yudah" and "Yehudi" and their Persian, Greek, and Latin cognates. "Judean," of course, was also the suspicious term non-Jews applied to Jews. By contrast, the fighters of the first and second revolts, as well as the rabbis, chose the term "Israel," attesting to the remaining power of the term long after the demise of the northern kingdom. Finally, Goodblatt reminds us how the rebels equally created the symbol of "Zion" as a marker of ethnopoli tical identity. His comparative reading of these three terms alongside each other 3. Martha Himmelfarb, A Kingdom of Priests: Ancestry and Merit in Ancient Judaism (Phila delphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006). 399</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews shows the great diversity within various Jewish political movements. Emphasizing not only diversity but also mutual polarization and occasional conflicts within Judaism (for instance as attested by Josephus's description of the gruesome battle among rebels from different regions during the first Jewish war) may have provided Goodblatt with an even more nuanced picture. Equally, Goodblatt's discussion may have benefited from a consideration of the notions of Judea and Israel in first-century literature from the Jewish Jesus movement, as in the Gospel of John and Revelations (cf. the contributions of John Marshall and David Frankfurter). These texts, in turn, can now be placed on the more detailed political landscape that Goodblatt drafts. In summary, I recommend Goodblatt's book as a valuable source for all those who wish to study the political history of the Second Temple period and its unmistakable imprint on late antiquity and beyond. Goodblatt mostly shies away from the simplistic equation of modern and ancient Jewish nationalism (cf. 202). Still, his success in showing elements of nationalism in ancient Judaism invites subsequent approaches to address the pressing question of poss ible continuities between ancient and modern Jewish corporate identities and of how much new there might exactly be under the sun.
