<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 27:1 (2003), 23-72 BETWEEN OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE DISPUTE: The Case of Christian Spain and Provence in the Late Middle Ages by Ram Ben-Shalom Literary and historical evidence of religious disputes that took place between Jews and Christians during the Middle Ages exists in a variety of sources. Hebrew manuscripts and Latin documents concerning such encounters survive from the disputations that were held in Paris (1240), Barcelona (1263), and Tortosa (1413- 1414). Some of these were written by participants themselves after the events de- scribed. Some were produced by Christian authors as protocols, either during or after the disputations. Significant discrepancies concerning the same dispute are to be found between the Christian and Jewish accounts.' Other material on this subject exists in the literature of the Christian Adversus Iudaeos (dating from late antiquity and the early Middle Ages) and in the Jewish polemical literature (dat- ing from the twelfth century). Pioneer studies have also recently appeared using the records of the Spanish Inquisition, in which much evidence was found con- cerning such disputes.2 Amos Funkenstein made an important preliminary classification of Christian arguments used in the Middle Ages against the Jews.3 His distinction between the "old polemic" and various types of "new polemic" was accepted by scholars, who nevertheless made distinctions or took issue over questions of periodization and of the aims and identity of the groups and institutions that adopted the new polemic.4 Jeremy Cohen formulated a complementary classification presenting four cate- I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Ora Limor for her critical suggestions in the preparation of this article.

This study addresses the religious dispute as it unfolded in reality (in contrast to its literary expression) in Spain and Provence up to the end of the fifteenth century as mani- fest in the Jewish sources. The first section describes two private disputes, whose traces were left in biblical commentary and the homiletical literature. Both took place in Spain, one during the fourteenth century, the other in the fifteenth centu- ry. The second section is a study of the general characteristics of religious dispute in Spain and Provence. It makes a distinction between the official dispute and the private one, with special attention given to the latter. Through an examination of numerous examples, we will see that private disputes were a common, dynamic phenomenon, part of the regular discourse between Jews and Christians up to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Provence. The two disputes studied in part one will be seen to be part of a more general practice as we ask what they add to our understanding of religious disputes in the Middle Ages.

This polemic was not divorced from his actual activities. Twice he testifies to having participated in religious disputes. The first instance, to be examined below, was with a bishop in Provence, and concerned the relation between the original Hebrew scripture and the Latin translations of the Old Testament.'2 The second dispute, which was described in ibn Caspi's interpretation of Genesis 49:10, took place in 1332, when ibn Caspi resided in Valencia in the Kingdom of Aragon.'3 Ibn Caspi writes that he engaged some Christian sages in debate but he does not describe the details of this dialogue, beyond noting its subject-the extent of Jewish guilt for the death of Jesus-and recounting his own answer to the Christians.14 Jewish guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus is a venerable motif in Christian theology. The idea was born in the Gospels, and was carried on in the writings of the Church fathers and theologians of the Middle Ages. Jeremy Cohen pointed to the change that occurred in the twelfth century in the perception of the Jews as the murderers of Jesus. The ancient tradition, resting principally on Augustine, posit- ed that the Jews had harmed Jesus out of ignorance of his messianism and divin- ity. After the twelfth century, however, the Jews were accused of malicious intent. This new view of Jesus' death was further developed during the thirteenth and the early fourteenth century in the theological writings of the Mendicant orders.'5 Jean Delumeau has described how this "theological discourse" fed the developing trend of popular animosity towards them in the medieval theater and in the ston- ing practiced during "holy week."'" Ibn Caspi noted two kinds of apologetics that were common responses to Christian accusations concerning Jesus' death, rejecting both completely. In an- swer to those Jews who denied their guilt by claiming that neither they nor their children had taken any part in the said actions, Ibn Caspi insisted that he consid- ered himself to be a participant in Jesus' death, and would behave in the same way today. "' In answer to those "vain sophists" who argued that responsibility for Je- 12. See B.

In Al-Harizi's Tahkemoni (Tel Aviv: Mahbarot le-Sifrut, 1952, 28, pp. 247-248), we find the claim that Jews were banished from Jerusalem because they were seen as Christ killers. Already in the twelfth century Joseph Kimhi rejected the accusation. Joseph Kimhi, "Sefer ha-Berit," in Sefer ha-Berit and the Radak's Dis- putes with Christianity, ed. E. Talmage (Jerusalem: The Bialik Institute, 1974), p. 65: "It was not at all their intention to kill the son of God, only their intention to kill a person born of a man and woman, and there is no sin in this for them because the intention is the heart of the matter." 16. See J. Delumeau, La peur en occident (XIVe-XVIII siecles) (Paris: Fayard-Librairie Arthbme Fayard, 1978), pp. 280-281. 17. The claim that Jesus' death was justified was not new. It is found in the Talmud, in the book The Life of Jesus, and in the polemical literature that predated ibn Caspi. See Sefer Nisahon Yashan, in D. Berger, The Jewish-Christian Debate in the High Middle Ages. A Critical Edition of the Nizzahon 25</page><page sequence="4">Ram Ben Shalom sus' death should not be laid at the feet of the Jews because Jesus wanted to die,'8 Ibn Caspi counters with the Christian response: Jewish intentions were bad, and were not at all concerned with satisfying the wishes of Jesus.19 It should be em- phasized that claiming Jesus' death at the hands of the Jews to be just could be quite dangerous; still, this is no reason to doubt the credibility of ibn Caspi's ac- count. There were other Jews in Aragon during these same years who did not hes- itate in making similar claims in private encounters.20 Before beginning his response to the Christian sages, ibn Caspi first reviews the characteristic divisions of society in the Holy Land in the time of Jesus. Jesus' followers were divided between Jews and Gentiles (Greeks, Romans, and others). Accordingly, ibn Caspi continued, the Christians are of the same blood of either the Jews or the non-Jews who followed Jesus, whereas the Jews are descendents of those Jews who rejected Jesus and refused to embrace his faith. For the sake of argument, he presumes the Christian sages to be descended from the Jewish be- lievers in Jesus while he and his fellow Jews are descended from those who at- tacked Jesus. Ibn Caspi has two points to make: (A) Jesus grew up with the Jews. He played, ate, drank, and performed all his other bodily functions, like any other person. When he matured he began to wander the streets and the synagogues and suddenly claimed that he was none other than God, while continuing to live and work as a mortal. Thus, not without reason did the Jews persecute him. Both Jew and Christian believe, as the Torah proclaims, that God is a "devouring fire,"21 accompanied by chariots of fire, fearful winged seraphs. If, on the one hand, Jesus had appeared in such an awesome manner, his per- secution would no doubt be a great sin on the part of the Jews. On the other hand, Vetus with an Introduction, Translation, and Commentary (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Soci- ety of America, 1979), p. 160 (paragraph 151). 18. This is one of Kimhi's answers, "Sefer ha-berit," p. 64; and Rabbi Hayyim ibn Musa, Sefer magen va-romah in Sefer magen va-romah, and A Letter to his Son (The National and University Li- brary manuscript). Hebrew University, p. 47. 19. This response is found, for instance, in a section of an essay found in the Cairo Geniza (writ- ten in Arabic letters) containing responses to anti-Christian arguments. In reference to the claim that Jesus' killers fulfilled his own wish, the writer contends that God judges the feelings of the heart. The killers of Jesus sought to destroy him and, hence, will not escape their punishment in hell. See S. Stroumsa, "The Polemic and its Ruin," (Hebrew) Pe'amim, 75 (1998), p. 99. The claim concerning the pernicious intentions of the Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus, vis-ai-vis the heavenly plan of redemp- tion and the necessity of the crucifixion, already arose at the end of the eighth century in a religious polemic between Muslims and Christians. See S. H. Griffith, "Jews and Muslims in Christian Syriac and Arabic Texts of the Ninth Century," Jewish History, III (1988), p. 76. 20. This was the instance of Vitalis Afraym in the village of Villanova de Cubells in Aragon dur- ing "Holy Week" of 1367. He passed one of the Christian youths who was engaged in reading the Passion and the latter accused him of bearing the Jews' guilt for the crucifixion. Vitalis responded that had he been present during the crucifixion he would have acted the same way himself. The report of this dispute is in E Baer, Die Juden im Christlichen Spanien (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1929), I, n. 285, p. 407. See too D. Nirenberg, Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages (New Jersey: Prince- ton University Press, 1996), p. 220. And see the sermon of Joseph ibn Shem Tov, delivered in the Segovia synagogue in 1452, which addressed the Jews' guilt for the crucifixion, in M. Saperstein, Jewish Preach- ing, 1200-1800, An Anthology (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1989), esp. pp. 177-179. 21. Deuteronomy 4:24; 9:3. 26</page><page sequence="5">The Case of Christian Spain and Provence in the Late Middle Ages if we assume that Jesus was indeed God, but altered his form to appear like any other pitiable Jew, then the Jews could not be blamed for persecuting him since he himself had misled them. Ibn Caspi offered a moral: if a king in today's world dis- guised himself as a Jew, entered a synagogue, claimed to be the king, and railed against the Jews, the latter would be obliged to attack him with a sword and kill him, and would be fully justified in doing so.22 (B) In ibn Caspi's second response he argues according to the Christian as- sumption that the Jews had indeed intended to injure Jesus. Yet, given that the deed was ultimately good (even as the intention was bad) the action of the Jews should be considered just.23 Two biblical examples explicate his position. One is the sale of Joseph into slavery by his brothers. Joseph told them that, while they intended the worst for him, the deed actually reflected the good will of God. Consequently, the brothers did not assume any guilt, having been directed by providence so that the day would come when the multitudes would be saved by Joseph.24 Thus it was with Jesus as well. The wrong done him turned out for the good in the eyes of Christians, and thus Jews could live among the Christians today.25 It followed that 22. Similar remarks were made in the dispute in the court of the bishop of Sens (perhaps Gual- terus Cornutus, who died in 1241) which was edited in the presence of "many bishops and priests." See R. Joseph b. R. Nathan Official, Sefer Yosef Hamekane, ed. Y. Rozental (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1970), 52, 1 [from the margins of the Hamburg manuscript], pp. 63-64; see also p. 39, 43, pp. 136-137 for two other perspectives on the absence of Jewish guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus. The parable is also to be found in Kimhi, "Sefer ha-Berit," pp. 29-30, and in The Nizzahon Vetus, 233, p. 157. However, there the aim was to show that the Jews should not be punished for their disbelief in Jesus. See Berger's com- mentary in Nizzahon Vetus, p. 338 (related to p. 222). A similar parable was attributed by the Jews to one of the Popes, who sought to use it to convince the king of France that he should protect the Jews. See the addition to the Parma manuscript 402, to the text by Solomon bar Moses bar Yekutiel, "'Edut 'Adonai ne'emana," in Y. Rosenthal, Studies and Sources (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1967), 1, p. 420 (Hebrew). 23. Thus ibn Caspi sought to counter the Christians' claim, mentioned above, concerning the evil Jewish intention to murder Jesus, in spite of the fact that Jesus himself wanted to die. The Jewish an- swer, justifying Jesus' death, was known already from the "On Pascha" sermon of Melito, the bishop of Sardis, from between the years 160-170. See Melito of Sardis, On Pascha and Fragments, ed. and trans. S. G. Hall (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), p. 41; see also J. Cohen, "Introduction," in J. Cohen, ed., Essential Papers on Judaism and Christianity in Conflict, From Late Antiquity to the Reformation (New York and London: New York University Press, 1991), pp. 9-10. See also: D. J. Lasker and S. Stroumsa, The Polemic of Nestor the Priest: Qissat Mujddalat al-Usquf and Sefer Nestor Ha-Komer, I (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute, 1996), pp. 137-138, n. 7. It should be pointed out that the intention was not to justi- fy the death of Jesus on the basis of Jewish law (see, for instance, Sanhedrin 43a and above n. 15), but to claim that his death was considered necessary on the basis of Christian theology. Ibn Caspi's innova- tion was in the use he made of Christian views of the evil intentions of the Jews. 24. See Genesis 45:5-8. 25. The reference here was apparently to the Augustinian view of the Jewish question, which was usually accepted by the Papacy. On one hand, blame on the Jews for rejecting Jesus and for his death; on the other hand, acceptance of their presence in the Christian world. See S. Simonsohn, The Apostolic See and the Jews, (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1991), pp. 4-6; K.R.

It should be noted that the story of Joseph's sale was well known to Christians, being interpreted by Christian scholars (Isidore of Seville and Bede) as a prefiguration of Jesus' death.26 Thus ibn Caspi offers an ironic interpretation of Joseph's sale as a prefiguration of the crucifixion; it ac- corded with providential design, and thus should rescue the Jews from any evil in- tent on the part of Christians. Ibn Caspi's second example from the bible is taken from the anonymous prophet sent by God to announce to Ahab that he was to die for having disobeyed him and letting the king of Aram, Ben-Hadad, go free. The prophet asked one of his companions to strike him in the name of God. The companion refused, upon which the prophet announced that because of his refusal to obey the word of God he would encounter a lion that would strike him. And this indeed happened. Af- terwards, the prophet met someone else who agreed to carry out God's command, and who struck him and injured him.27 In regard to the biblical passage describ- ing the injury suffered by the prophet, ibn Caspi comments that the second person was overzealous in carrying out the sentence since he understood that injury was the intent of God.28 This tale is a parable for the Jews' injury of Jesus. Ibn Caspi tells the Christians that they are comparable to the first person in the story who re- fused to strike the prophet and was subsequently punished, and that the Jews played the role of the second figure who agreed to strike the prophet and exaggerated his blows (which is analogous to the "malicious intent" with which the Jews were charged). Jesus, who was God's messenger, or was God himself, is compared here to the same prophet who was struck and about whom it was said that he disguised himself so that Ahab would not recognize him:29 esp. pp. 29-30, 51-54; J. Cohen, Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), pp. 35-41. 26. See Berger, The Nizzahon Vetus, p. 247, note on p. 57, line 3. In Gottfried Reeg, ed., Die Geschichte von den zehn Martyrern: synoptische Edition mit Obersetzung und Einleitung (Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1985), pp. 10-17, the Roman Emperor Hadrian justifies the killing of the ten with the crime of Joseph's being sold into bondage by his brothers. Later (pp. 32-33), a voice in the heavens expresses this justification. See I.G. Marcus, "The Santification of the Name in Ashkenaz and the Sto- ry of Rabbi Amnon of Magenza" (Hebrew), in Y. Gafni and A. Ravitzky, eds., Sanctity of Life and Mar- tyrdom: Studies in Memory of Amir Yekutiel (Jerusalem: The Zalman Shazar Center, 1992), (Hebrew), pp. 137-138, who interprets the midrash as a Jewish counterclaim to Christian denunciations, noting that the atoning death of the ten scholars ("the collective image of Jesus") means that the Jews should no longer have to suffer for the sale of Joseph and the crucifixion of Jesus, even if they were deserv- ing of such from a Christian point of view. 27. I Kings 20:35-7. 28. It is interesting to consult, in this context, the rabbinic midrash, which David Kimhi cites in his commentary on I Kings, 20:37: "And in the midrashic interpretation, that drop of blood that came out of the just one was an atonement for Israel so that they would not die in the war of Ramot Gil'ad, for the prophet told him (verse 42): 'and thy people for his people,' for they deserve the death penalty; but [they were spared as] this same drop of blood was an atonement for them." And so it is possible to find a connection between the idea of the injured prophet's blood, which brings atonement to the peo- ple of Israel, and the Christological idea of Jesus' blood which atones for the original sin. 29. I Kings 20:38. This corresponds to the Lord (Jesus) who disguised himself and assumed the figure of a man. 28</page><page sequence="7">The Case of Christian Spain and Provence in the Late Middle Ages Thus he [Jesus] pursued this remarkable ruse in order to be crucified. Since he was God he aroused us and ordered us to [do] this; he showed grace and honor to us, who love him. That is, he bestowed grace on us by allowing us to do this honorable commandment, and honor in that he did not want the other, uncircumcised peoples to torment him; thus, not you but only we, sons of the honorable sect, are so honored. It is comparable to the ways of ministers and kings who, when captured in war, surrender themselves only to kings or sons of kings like us, as the Lord told us at Mount Sinai, you shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests [Exodus 19:6], and if he is indeed God, he will continue to do us more good turns, on account of the good we do for him, and As the Lord liveth, he has done us many good turns from then until now, and will con- tinue to do so, amen and amen.30 The assumption that Jesus was God thus raised numerous problems for those who sought to blame the Jews for his death. According to ibn Caspi, the Jews' at- tack on Jesus was an act of grace, as were the blows and injury done the prophet, both actions coming at the behest of God. Ibn Caspi emphasizes the honor Jesus bestowed on the Jews in choosing them to put him to death, illustrating his point with the practice of kings in surrendering only to those of equal rank. He also claimes, in closing, that if Jesus is indeed God, then the Jews were deserving of further favors for their role in his death, of the kind they had enjoyed since the cru- cifixion. Ibn Caspi's irony is obvious. The difficulties and degradation suffered by the Jews in exile during the Christian era were central to Christian vilifications of Jewish unbelief, and were considered by them to be proof that God had abandoned his chosen people.31 Ibn Caspi's remarks are, thus, a way of underlining the ab- surdity in the deification of Jesus and exposing the logical difficulties in the sys- tem of Christian belief. The positive role played by the Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus (as explained by ibn Caspi), the acceptance of Jesus as God, assigning the blame for his death on the Jews, and the actual condition of the Jews in exile- each of these situations contradicted the others. Assuming Jesus to be God under- mines any Jewish blame for his death, and even credits the Jews with an act of grace. But in terms of reciprocity, the degradation of the Jews in exile was in- consistent with their actions, leading one to the conclusion that Jesus was not God. Like Joseph ibn Caspi, the biblical interpreter and preacher Isaac Arama (who lived approximately from 1420 until the Expulsion in Castile and Aragon) polemicized frequently against Christianity. Only in one instance, however, does Arama report engaging in an actual dispute.32 This took place in the second half 30. Masref la-kesef, p. 109. 31. See O. Limor, Jews and Christians in Western Europe: Encounter between Cultures in the MiddleAges and the Renaissance (Hebrew) (Tel Aviv: The Open University of Israel, 1993), 3, pp. 57, 87-90; see text near below n. 142, concerning the claim of the disputing priest in the dispute with Jacob ben Reuben; Y.

S. Heller-Wilensky, Rabbi Isaac Arama and his Beliefs (Hebrew) (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: The Bialik Institute, 1956), pp. 27-28, mistakenly describes the literary polemics of Arama as actual disputes. Arama himself did not participate in the dispute with the Christian concerning the divorce of 29</page><page sequence="8">Ram Ben Shalom of the fifteenth century, with a Christian preacher, apparently from Aragon. Since the thirteenth century, the Jews of Aragon had been occasionally required to at- tend sermons delivered by Christian missionaries in the aljama and the syna- gogue.33 In the fifteenth century many willingly attended these sermons, drawn by their philosophic content.34 Arama's dispute was, apparently, stimulated by such a sermon, preached by a Christian sage to a mixed Christian and Jewish audience outside of the Jewish aljama.35 One of the subjects raised in the sermon was predestination. As biblical cor- roboration of his views, the preacher quoted the passage "Yet I loved Jacob; But Esau I hated."36 He claimed that, in contrast to accepted opinion, God did not love man because of the latter's integrity or right. Rather, the integrity of the just man is derived from the love of God for him. Wicked persons, on the other hand, are not predestined to be so. Their evil issues from within themselves. The preacher provided a long explanation, one supported by biblical examples and proofs.37 He gave expression to a Christian philosophical approach intended to resolve the moral difficulties inherent in the praedestinatio duplex, according to which God assigns good and evil, meaning that the punishment of the wicked is determined ahead of time. According to the less extreme philosophical understanding of pre- destination, evil exists not because of God's will, but because of his permission (permissio). Augustine,38 for instance, utilized Neoplatonic philosophy to explain that there was no reason for evil's existence and that, therefore, God plays no part in man's original sin. Additional theologians, such as Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas, recognized only predestination for the better.39 The preacher in Aragon presented a view close to that of Thomas' in Summa Theologica and Su- per ad Romanos.40 No dispute developed directly during the sermon. Afterwards, however, a number of Christian and Jewish scholars met.41 Arama desired to comment on the a converted Jew (see below p. 57) but addressed the issue only after the dispute. Heller-Wilensky's ob- servation on Arama's need to respond in his homilies (or his biblical interpretations) to the subjects that had arisen already in the Tortosa disputation, and which in his opinion were not properly answered by the disputing Jews, is worthy of comment. 33. See below pp. 37-41. 34. Isaac Arama, Aqedat Yishaq, I (Fresburg, 1849), Introduction, 1, la. 35. See Isaac Arama, Hazut Qashah, 4:1, from 'Aqedat Yishaq, 6 (n.p.), where he notes that the Jews were "called" to hear a sermon before a great assembly. It follows from his remarks that the Chris- tians constituted the majority of the audience; this, and the use of the phrase "called us," indicates that this was probably not a forced sermon. 36.

Its public setting had apparently kept him from responding ear- lier. But Arama felt able to initiate debate in this more restricted forum of intel- lectuals. The first thing he did was praise the preacher's remarks in general.42 He then remarked that if the Christian had intended to assert that the love of God is prior to humanity, that is, prior to his giving all persons their consciousness--so that man could freely choose to worship God-that he could accept such a claim. But one would also have to include the wicked in such a generalization, for they were also given free choice. However, if the intent was to suggest that the good- ness of a specific individual person is derived from God's love for him, then he couldn't accept it since that person must then necessarily choose good. In this in- stance, only evil is done from free will; the just person is, thus, unworthy of reward. The Christian responded that his intention was indeed to claim that predes- tination affects each and every person: For no man would behave better than anyone else, unless he is first conscious of God's great passion to bring him close to him ... And all good flows from God's love, blessed is he; that love must precede what is right, as the cause pre- cedes the effect.43 On the surface, this dispute was purely philosophical, without connection to disagreements between Judaism and Christianity. Such dialogue between philoso- phers of the two religions was a well-known practice in the Middle Ages, particu- larly so in the Mediterranean world. This comes as no surprise in light of the com- mon range of interests shared by Christian and Jewish scholars seeking to harmonize and compromise between revelation and knowledge.44 The logical con- flict between predestination and free will was a subject for both Christian and Jew- ish philosophy since it had far-reaching social and moral ramifications in monothe- istic cultures with concepts of reward and punishment. A variety of solutions to the problem were proposed, and there were differences within each camp.45 Isaac Ara- 42. These remarks do not exhibit empty civility. Arama had great respect for Christian theolo- gy and he did not hesitate to express that in his writings. See, for instance, Hazut qashah, eighth chap- ter: "For here is everyone [Christianity and Islam], although they are the last to receive religion, they chose the path of faith and maintained their religion without allowing philosophy to overturn anything in it. This is especially so regarding the Christians, who entirely refuted the words of the philosophers, despite the [Christians] being great intellects and grand masters in [philosophy]." 43.

Hasdai Crescas' innovative theory of free will was meant to show, according to Yishaq Baer, "that even if the edict of God led many to be overwhelmed by the rising waters of baptism, responsibility for their actions was not rescinded from them, and they had to answer for it."o5 Joseph Albo, Isaac Arama, and Isaac Abravanel each, in his own way, took issue with Crescas' view on the question of determinism.5" Even Joseph ben Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov (who died around 1460), wrote a work (since lost) entitled Da'at 'Elyon opposing the deterministic arguments put forward in Abner of Burgos' Sod ha-Gemul.52 The idea of predestination was already evident in the New Testament and has been the subject of Christian thought since the Greek Church fathers and Augus- tine.53 The Christian sermon reported by Arama addressed, like most theologians had since the Church fathers, the teachings of Paul in Romans (9: 11-24), based in part on the verse that appears in the Book of Malachi.54 Paul ties the passage "Yet I loved Jacob; But Esau I hated" to the prophecy spoken to Rebeccah: "Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger."55 46.

The election was "not of works, but of him that calleth."56 This is the Pauline notion of election in grace that was given common expression in his epistles.57 This is how Paul and those theologians who came after him58 illustrated God's preference for the Christians and his abandonment of the Jews. The Jews are perceived as Esau and the Christians as Jacob, and on the basis of the prophecy, the Jewish people (the "elder") will wor- ship the Christians (the "younger"), who were predestined to superiority.59 In light of the Christian uses of the belief in predestination, as expressed or insinuated by the preacher, and in light of the role that predestination played in ar- guments designed to convert Jews, it is clear why Arama was quick to reject the claims made in the sermon. Arama observed that the Christian considered his ar- guments, quoted above, to be a model of reasoning that could not be refuted. In his arguments against the Christian, Arama, using the syllogistic style of Christian disputants, adopted four opposing arguments. They were: (1) A philosophical argument: In his Ethics, Aristotle had already discussed man's free will to choose good or evil. If he occasionally raised a certain argument against free choice, it was only in regard to evil deeds, while insisting that good actions are always the product of free will.60 (2) A theological argument: The sermon's starting assumption casts asper- sions on God's integrity and paints a picture of an "unjust" God since the man who is unloved by God must commit evil. Arama claims that this assumption cannot stand the test of religious logic which posits the integrity and righteousness of God as a crucial tenet.61 (3) A claim from reality: The sermon's reasoning does not allow any possi- bility for man to improve his ways. One's righteousness or wickedness is prede- termined. Yet, Arama believes that [if all is predestined] people are fated to remain in their moral state, with no possibility of change. In reality, however, this does not seem to be the case. Instances of important men discovering the true path are well known to all. What's more, the Christian view of "angels becoming devils"62 sug- gests that such change is possible. 56. Romans 9:11. 57. See, in particular, Romans, 8:30; Farrelly, Predestination, pp. 52-70. 58.

See, 33</page><page sequence="12">Ram Ben Shalom (4) A biblical claim: Arama cites verses contradicting the sermon's reason- ing, such as what is said of Abraham in Genesis 18:19: "For I know him, that [lema'an] he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him." At first glance, this passage seems to support the sermon's assumption concerning how God's knowledge precedes the way of the righteous. But Arama, according to Rashi, interprets this knowing of God to mean God's love, which is dependent on Abraham's integrity, the latter nec- essarily preceding the former.63 Another verse is taken from Deuteronomy 10:12: "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul." Here Arama argues that if the preacher's assumption is true, then why does God ask man to do that which is not under his control: "He will love him [man] and his request will be given." That is, God's re- quest seems absurd since he is able to love him in advance, which would then mean that no request is necessary. Arama contends that this absurdity can be demon- strated using numerous other biblical passages. This marks the end of Arama's description of the dispute. Arama refrains from presenting the Christian's answers, noting only that his arguments became entangled and confused and that he was unable to demonstrate any concrete point.64 In the analysis of the two disputes presented above, methodological issues arise related to how to understand literary accounts of religious confrontations. In each case we have only the Jewish side of the argument. In addition, ibn Caspi left out the points made by the Christian scholars who engaged him, and Arama quotes only portions of the preacher's arguments. It must also be noted that we cannot be certain that these disputes indeed took place in the manner described; these are for instance, The General Epistle of Jude, 6; The Second Epistle General of Peter, 2, 4. Anselm of Can- terbury's discussion of the problem of predestination and free will is found in his work concerning the fall of the angels. See Anselm de Canterbury, De casu diaboli, 2, in: Opera omnia, ed. E S. Schmitt, 1 (Seckau 1938), p. 235. On Thomas Aquinas' perspective on the fallen angels see Farrelly, Predestina- tion, pp. 119-120, and n. 28. Rationalistic Jewish commentaries in the Middle Ages did not, in gener- al, consider the "children of God" to be the embodiment of Godly entities but to be persons who were called such because of their character and personality. See, for instance, the commentaries of Rashi and of Abraham ibn Ezra, ad loc. By contrast, in Pirqe de-Rabi 'Eli'ezer, 22 (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 71- 72, the children of God are seen as fallen angels.

Lasker (Ramat-Gan and Beer-Sheva: Bar-Ilan University Press and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 1990), 10, pp. 90-96, devoted an entire chapter to refuting the Christian view concerning the change in the nature of the angels and their loss of divine choice as a result of the Fall. Arama was well ac- quainted with Crescas' views of choice and fallen angels (See Heller-Wilensky, Arama, p. 42, 159- 160, 163 on the use Arama made of Crescas' work, Sefer 'or 'Adonai, and on his differences with him. 63. See Rashi's interpretation of Genesis, 18:19. 64. Hazut qashah, Chapter 4:4. The debates between Jews and Christians never rested entirely on pure logic; rather, logic and philosophy served as polemical devices alongside arguments taken from biblical interpretation and actual history.

It can also be wondered if the Jew- ish writer distorted the Christian side of the debate in order to emphasize his own message and to establish the superiority of his argument because this type of liter- ature was also intended to raise the spirit and strengthen the resolve of its readers. Despite these reservations, there is no reason to doubt that this material is evidence of real disputes. Ibn Caspi and Arama both wrote for an audience that was fully conscious of the rules governing religious disputes and of the limits of the Jewish-Christian dialogue. Even if these specific disputes did not occur ex- actly as described-and there is a clear bias in favor of the Jewish, "winning" po- sition-one can confidently assume that the setting and Jewish arguments are re- flected accurately. Any significant distortions on the part of the Jewish writer would provoke the basic distrust of the contemporary reader, thus undermining the didactic aim of the project. The principal historical significance of these two reports is found in their descriptions of the friendly atmosphere and the relative freedom of expression that characterized the disputes. Ibn Caspi made claims that, in a different setting, could have been interpreted as blasphemous. One example of such was his assertion that he would repeat the crucifixion of Jesus. Similarly, Arama described how Jews liv- ing in a Christian city came of their own accord to hear Christian sermons, and how free intellectual discussion between Jewish and Christian scholars took place. We know about this phenomenon from other sources, and, what's more, about Christians coming to hear Jewish sermons in synagogues.65 These practices were apparently prevalent only in the private disputes of the Middle Ages. Below we shall try to evaluate the scope of this phenomenon and its dating, and will show the differences between it and the official disputation. II Religious disputes between Jews and Christians in the Middle Ages were carried out in two primary channels. The first was the consciously initiated and of- ficial public encounter. The second was private, either spontaneous or planned, sometimes taking place in public view, sometimes not. The latter is defined here as an event or a dialogue in which Christian and Jew meet and exchange opposing beliefs concerning religious and cultural issues. Since the thirteenth century, the Christian establishment doubtless preferred the public channel. Careful plotting of the event, including the choice of the Christian representative, the rules of debate, 65. This was the case, for example, with Cuellar, in the 1470s, when the Christians came to the synagogue at Rosh ha-shanah to hear the sermon of "Rabbi Samuel, the duke's physican." Rabbi Samuel was thought to be a great philosopher who sermonized on philosophical matters whom the Christians were allowed to hear because he did not combine his remarks with religious matters. See Baer, A His- tory, 2, p. 251. It was also said of Soria in the 1470s (in an inquisition trial of 1502) that Christians and conversos attended sermons in the synagogue. See C. Carrete Parrondo (ed.), Fontes Iudaeorum Regni Castellae, II, El Tribunal de la Inquisicidn en el Obispado de Soria (1486-1502) (Salamanca: Univer- sidad Pontificia de Salamanca, 1985), 140, p. 74.

The results of most of the official disputes in the Middle Ages were, for them, disastrous. The need arose to prevent such encounters ahead of time, or to stop them in the middle. In the Paris disputation of 1240, the first of the offi- cial national disputes, the Jewish representatives were subjected to an Inquisition interrogation, after their Talmudic volumes were confiscated and handed over to the Dominicans for safekeeping.67 During the Barcelona disputation of 1263, Nahmanides wrote that the king of Aragon, James I, ordered him to appear before Paul Christian (that is to say, he did not come on his own free will).68 On the fourth day, Nahmanides sought to put an end to the debate because of the aggressive mis- sionary activities of the Dominicans in Barcelona, "who cast terror over the whole world."69 In the Tortosa disputation as well (1413-1414) the Jewish representa- tives attempted to stop the event before it had begun, trying to end it on the first day, and thereafter as well.70 It was already clear to the Jewish scholars in the sum- mons to the disputation that this would not be a confrontation between two equal sides, but a demonstration of the validity of the Christian faith according to the 66. Official disputations began in the thirteenth century. However, the ideology of bringing the Jews to convert through a forced religious dispute imposed by the state had already existed for many centuries. Traces of its origins may be seen in the legend of Actus S. Silvestri, according to which the Emperor Constantine initiated an official disputation between Silvester and twelve rabbis. Silvester de- feated his opponents and, as a result, Helena, the mother of the Emperor, converted to Christianity and after her the Jewish participants and their coreligionists. In contrast to the Jewish-Christian discourse that had existed prior to the legend, it was now expected that the forced dispute's participants and their coreligionists would accept the "judges' " decision (in this instance, the decision of Constantine, He- lena, and two pagan philosophers) and convert.

Jerome de Santa Fe repeatedly claimed during the course of the disputation that it had not been the intention of the Pope, Benedict XIII, to initiate a disputation, but to instruct them (and the general public) in the principles of Christianity.71 Official disputations of a local and less organized nature took place in Aragon after 1242, once James I and other kings permitted the Mendicant orders to preach in the synagogues.72 About a week following the Barcelona disputation, James I and the Mendicants wanted to preach in the synagogue on Shabbat, before the entire Barcelona community. Nahmanides insisted on replying, leading him to remain in Barcelona an extra eight days. The king delivered the first sermon, seek- ing to prove Jesus' messianism while referring to the holy Trinity. Nahmanides rose and answered him. Then the head of the Dominican order, Raymond de Pefiaforte, gave a sermon on the holy Trinity. Nahmanides answered him as well. The last to speak on the Trinity was Paul Christian, and he, too, received a response from Nah- manides. The Christians preached their creed from the synagogue's bimah while Nahmanides apparently stood among the audience.73 Descriptions of these coerced sermons as attacks on a passive Jewish audi- ence74 is not exact. The Jews did often fear answering the Christian preacher in the synagogue,75 and James I even demanded that the Jews listen patiently ("et pa- tienter audiant predicationem eorum").76 This is not enough, however, to deny the Jews any kind of response. James did not necessarily want to repress debate be- tween the Preachers and the Jews.77 Rather, in my opinion, the order to listen pa- tiently was intended to prevent outbursts and arguments from erupting during the sermons, but not to prevent debate to develop once the Christian preacher had fin- ished. James' decree of August 29, 1263, following the Barcelona dispute which allowed Paul Christian to sermonize among the Jews, clearly stipulated that he was allowed to dispute with the Jews. The Jews were ordered to listen to him patient- ly, and then to answer him with respect and admiration, and without deception or cheating.7" The next day (August 30) James restricted Mendicant sermons to the Jewish quarter alone, and decreed that the Jews could attend, if they wished.79 In October, 1268 James I restricted the number of escorts allowed the Christian 71.

James II, the king of Aragon, also allowed the Mendicants to establish compulsory sermons (August 1296), issuing explicit approval for religious debates.83 Riera i Sans estimates that this decree reflected the actual character of the meeting between Christian preach- ers and Jewish audiences.84 Similar events took place in the second half of the thirteenth century in Provence as well, as can be deduced from the dispute in the Narbonne synagogue between Meir ben Simeon and a Dominican monk who preached to the Jewish community while accompanied by a group of Christians.85 The Archbishop of Narbonne, Guilllaume de Broue (1245-1257), who sought to implement the anti- usury edicts of the king of France, Louis IX, first preached his views on usury to the Jews of Narbonne and Capestang in a gathering of the Jewish communities' scholars and leaders.86 The Jews were given an opportunity to respond, sometimes by explicit royal decree,87 thus turning these events into a religious dispute.

Even so, we should consider these official debates as a result of the roy- al license given the Christian preachers to compel the Jews to attend their ser- mons.88 However, they were more spontaneous, and sometimes dependent on the audience's willingness to select a representative from the community to answer the charges,89 or on the preacher's willingness to so engage. Such spontaneity seems to be manifest in the confrontations between Meir ben Simeon and the monk in the synagogue, and with the Archbishop of Narbonne. It should be noted that even dur- ing the period of the aggressive campaign by Vincent Ferrer in Castile and Aragon (1411-1415), the Jews occasionally dared try to respond to the accusations made by the preacher. In Perpignan (1415) guards protected the Jews during the time of the sermons. In a sermon delivered in the Church of the Dominican Monastery Ferrer attacked the rabbis' lack of understanding of biblical passages concerning the holy name of God. Some of the Jews in attendance (including Jaco Struch and Vidal Struch) rose and declared that they, in contrast to Ferrer, had a clear under- standing of the meaning of the holy writings. Their response provoked public out- cry and intervention by the guards was required to restore order.90 Similar disputes also occurred in Avila, when Henry II, King of Castile (1369- 1379), allowed two converts to order the Jews to attend any place of their choosing (including churches) to listen to their preaching.9' Moses ha-Cohen of Tordesillas described the Avila disputes in his book, 'Ezer ha-'Emunah (1375-1379): that the Jews received permission to respond points to the existence of a semi-official dispute.

And at first they invited us to their cathedral ... He began with the prophesy of "A child will be born to us, a son given us,"92 claiming that all the following names93 applied to Jesus: [he is] our messiah, he is our God, he is our father, he is our king, he is our savior; [he further claimed that] the [let- ter] 'mem' from "le-marbeh ha-misrah," "That the government may be in- creased"94 is closed, alluding to his mother the maiden who was closed and a virgin, in the end as in the beginning, in purity and cleanliness, from birth and from impregnation.95 There were other sermons and disputes, that seemed sharp and dialectical, and they are as thorns cut down. As one of them was sharp and eloquent, and responded first, I re- sponded to his arguments, and refuted all his proofs, four times in all, in the assembly of nations and peoples, [with] all the public of Christians and of Ish- maelites, and he [used] numerous riddles and parables, and each time I con- tradicted his words, proofs, and remarks with proofs and prophecies from the Prophets and the Writings and from our holy Torah, and from the Gospel, which is their New Testament. And the leaders [tovei ha-'ir] of the communi- ty and its scholars entreated me to write all four debates for them, to be in their hands as a keepsake, and a reminder.96 The four debates took place in Avila's cathedral, attended by Jews, Chris- tians, and Muslims. As was often the case, the Church was represented in the of- ficial debate by Jewish converts.97 Moses ha-Cohen felt he succeeded in effec- 92. Isaiah 9:5. 93. The reference is to the continuation of Isaiah 9:5, "And his name is called Pele-yoes-'el- gibbor-'abiad-sar-shalom" ("wonderful in counsel is God the Mighty, the everlasting Father, the Ruler of peace"). These names were given to Jesus by the Church fathers. The dispute over this passage ap- pears already in Hebrew polemical works from the twelfth century. See Jacob ben Reuben, Milhamot ha-Shem, Y.

In many disputes of the Middle Ages, the author notes in the introduction that his friends, students, or public leaders had asked him to write the work in order to provide them with ammunition in religious confrontations.99 The impression even occasionally arises that this is a literary con- vention, conforming to the rules of "accessus ad auctores" in justifying the work's composition.'00 This was not usually the case though. Religious polemic was a common everyday affair between Jews and the majority society. Comments by nu- merous Christians'0' and Jews102 attest to that, and sources outside the genre of polemics show that the Jewish public turned to scholars to provide them with an- swers to Christian arguments. For example, in Lerida, in contrast to Avila, they could not find a disputant within the community to counter the arguments of the Christian sages. The Christian preached on the Christological interpretation to the verse "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come."l03 His remarks succeeded in provoking doubts among the Jews, who then turned to Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham ben Adret (the Rashba), the leading religious authority in Aragon, and asked him to reply in writing to the preacher's claims.104 eral sense of Scripture as well as the aggadot, some of which are cited in support of their religion, and some are cited to defame us in the eyes of the Christians, our lords ... 98.

The trials were biased against the accused, who knew that "vic- tory" in the encounter would lead to his demise. The dispute between Baruch (a Ger- man Jew forcibly converted in Toulouse during the Shephard's crusade in 1320) and the Bishop of Pamier, Jacques Fournier, lasted five weeks. In addition to the Chris- tian notary, the dispute was attended by several "new Christians" and a Jewish in- terpreter from Troyes named Magister David. The subjects of debate were standard ones (the Trinity, the messiah as both God and man, the virgin birth, the death that brings atonement, resurrection of the dead, the sacraments, and revocation of the Jewish commandments), and Baruch's gradual embrace of the righteousness of Christianity was a requisite condition for ameliorating his sentence. At its conclu- sion, Baruch confessed that Catholicism was the true faith and that he had been brought to believe in it, not as a result of persecution and forced baptism, "but rather through the Holy Scriptures as explained to him by the Lord Bishop."'05 From the twelfth century the Church sought to direct religious disputes into official channels. The means of doing this was a long series of rules and regula- tions which forbade religious disputes at the lay (laici) level, under the threat of excommunicaiton.' 6 Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter (1180-1184), warned against disputing with the Jews in the presence of non-believers or the inexperi- enced.'07 In the thirteenth century the prohibitions increased, now encompassing non-learned priests.o08 As the king of France, Louis IX, announced: "No one, un- less he is an expert theologian, should venture to argue with these people [the 105.

See Grayzel, The Church, p. 318 for decisions from the Trier in 1227: "Item precipimus quod sacerdotes illiterati non conferant cum Judeis coram laicis." Especially important in the present context is the edict issued by James I, in the Church Council in Tarazona in 1233, in Grayzel, The Church, p. 324, XXVII: "Irrefragabiliter statuentes decernimus et firmiter inhibemus, ne cuique laice persone liceat publice vel privatim de fide catholica disputare; et qui contra fecerit, cum constiterit, a propio episcopo excom- municetur, et nisi se purgaverit tamquam suspectus de heresi habeatur."

But a layman, whenever he hears the Christian religion abused, should not attempt to defend its tenets, except with his sword, and that he should thrust into the scoundrel's belly, and as far as it will enter."'09 Thomas Aquinas also recom- mended avoiding disputes with Jews, unless they are organized and administered in public by the Church. 10 As Ora Limor notes, the reason for the Church's oppo- sition was not only the lay Christian's disadvantage when confronting the superi- or knowledge of a learned Jew."'I The Church was also conscious that lay disputes represented a challenge to its absolute authority to interpret the holy scriptures.112 In Mendicant practice, there was a difference between normal missionary activi- ties, which might lead to a dispute but which did not require any special internal sanction, and an officially initiated theological dispute. Dominicans who sought to engage in disputes with Jewish religious scholars (as with Muslims) in Spain re- quired a special license from the studia for oriental languages.'13 The Jewish attitude toward private disputes was ambivalent. On the surface, such disputes gave them the opportunity to present their case without fear of a reac- tion from the Christian establishment. However, as Solomon bar Moses of Rome (who lived in the second half of the thirteenth century) wrote in his guidebook to the disputant, Edut Adonai Ne'emanah, if the Jews win the encounter "the anger will be great at the contempt and invalidation of the Christians' faith," and if they should lose "the truth will be disgraced and will disappear." 14 Consequently, Solomon bar Moses advised the Jews to avoid frequent disputes with the Christians.1 15 In contrast to the Church codes, Jewish community laws did not prohibit pri- vate disputations with Christians, even though the Jews were fully aware of the problematic nature of such disputes. Sefer Hasidim (dating from the second half of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century in Germany), for exam- ple, instructs Jews not to engage monks, priests, or converts unless the Jewish dis- putant is particularly learned and shrewd. It also prohibits Talmudic scholars seek- ing honor and unafraid of sinning, together with Sadikim who are not particularly learned, from participating in disputes at all.' 16 Solomon bar Moses also argued 109.

That should be left, rather, to those who are virtuous, careful in expressing themselves, knowledgable in phi- losophy, thoroughly acquainted with the Bible (especially the Prophets), lucid in delivery, accustomed to scholarly gatherings, and fluent in the local tongue."17 He emphasizes that if a Jew must engage in polemic, he should choose his rival care- fully. He recommends not debating with Christian laity because of the Church's prohibitions,11" and because an efficient, orderly dispute in which each side fully understands the counterarguments of the other would not be possible.1 19 He also opposes debating with enemies or foes who will then use the statements of the Jew to attack him and his coreligionists with false libels. No dispute should be entered into with those easily provoked; and it is best to avoid engaging with scholastics, who usually succeeded, using their invalid methods, to prove false claims.120 According to Solomon bar Moses, the ideal dispute is one held with "those knowledgeable of religion and law, possessing a calm disposition, lovers of truth and seekers of justice, in an appropriate, modest place, in the presence of atten- tive, quiet scholars, not in the markets or streets where the loud, inferior common people congregate and confuse."'21 Solomon bar Moses even seeks to limit the subjects of the disputation in order to avoid a blasphemy of the Christian faith and of Jesus.122 In contrast, David of Modena (after 1492) accuses the Spanish Jews of having transgressed the scholars' prohibition against debating questions of faith, and claims that because of this sin many were killed and many others con- verted in the pogroms of 1391. 23 It is possible that his views reflected the image 117.

He should also not dispute with his enemies and evil-seekers because they plot against him and against us and will take advantage of his words ....

It should be noted that the recommendations to avoid re- ligious disputes came from Germany and Italy, pointing to the different attitude of Spanish and Provengal Jews toward the question. An illuminating example of this attitude among Spanish Jewry is found in the literary work, Ahituv ve-Salmon, written by Mattathias ha-Yishari, one of the rep- resentatives of the Aragon community in the Tortosa disputation. In one of the book's scenes, a Christian and Jew debate the true faith before a pagan queen. The Christian, who at a certain point in the exchange feels that he cannot win, recalls the Church's prohibition against disputing with Jews and asks to put an immedi- ate end to the debate. The Jew agrees to his demand, while first exploiting it to his advantage by claiming that the very existence of such a prohibition on the part of the Church reveals the Christians' fears of losing such disputes, and their appre- hension that the Jews could simply destroy the entire theological structure they had built.'24 Ha-Yishari's story is, first and foremost, an indication of the awareness of Spanish Jewry of the prohibition by the Church on private disputes,125 and of how it was possible to use this prohibition to strengthen devotion to Judaism. Testimony concerning private disputes is to be found in medieval polemical works written both by Christians'26 and Jews.127 Many of the Jews who labored the Sages who said not to dispute over matters of religion."

It is interesting in this context to point to the Jewish historiographical tradition that connects the causes of the Shepherds' crusade against the Jews in 1320 to the religious disputation which they held beforehand with one of the Jews. Once the shepherds realized that the Jew was about to defeat them in the confrontation, they killed him and began the pogrom. See Shevet Yehuda, p. 23. 124.

Some never alluded to such experience; others noted that they had debated a certain Christian scholar. Some gave short de- scriptions of such events. Especially remarkable in this context is the case of Pro- fayt Duran, who, in the wake of the 1391 pogroms, composed the most important polemical works in Spain, 'Iggeret al tehi ka-'avotekha (1394 or 1395) and Keli- mat ha-Goyim (1396). In these works Duran developed the methods of philo- sophical arguments against Christianity and of criticism of the New Testament. The reader of the now standard Talmage edition of Kelimat ha-Goyim (based on seven manuscripts) will find no mention of actual disputes in which the author en- gaged. It would seem, at first, that Duran never took part in a religious dispute, or that at least no evidence of such has survived. However, according to one of the manuscripts of Kelimat ha-Goyim (Budapest, the Hungarian Academy of Sci- ences, Kaufman 299), sections of which were printed in the old edition of Poz- nanski, there is an extant report of one dispute Duran engaged in with a Christian scholar whose name was Juan.128 This report revises completely the previous as- sumption concerning Duran's non-participation in disputes, and even indicates that the phenomenon of private dispute was far more common than what is reflected in the polemical literature. David Berger, for example, points to the challenge posed to Christians by Jewish disputants as an explanation for the large number of Christian polemics written in the twelfth century.129 Several instances will be examined below, in an attempt to understand the circumstances and the particular atmosphere characteristic of each dispute. As the examples of ibn Caspi and Arama made clear, one of the more notable aspects of the private dispute was the use of polemical arguments not raised in official dis- putations. There is good reason, then, to study these less conventional arguments. Polemic, p. 50; H.

"Just as I responded to one of the nations' scholars, named Juan, who came to me an filis and told me about the verse [Deuteronomy, 29, 27], "and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day," that the same big lamed [in the words "cast them," vayeshalhem] is the signal and the sign of Jesus as a king. I told him that, actually, from this passage we can understand why they were cast into another land. It is be- cause they crowned Jesus and called him: God, king of the world." It is difficult to accept Poznansky's speculation in his note on this passage (n. 1) that the meaningless and possibly mistaken expression "an filis" indicates Montpellier. It is perhaps possible to entertain the possibility that this is about the Car- naval period (Fallas) which is still practiced in several places (including Valencia) during the week pre- ceeding the nineteenth of March. 129.

However, it should be noted that religious disputes between Jews and Christians already took place in Muslim Spain (Al- Andalus) in the first half of the eleventh century. 30 Jacob resided among Chris- tians in "Morad Gasikuyya."'31 He befriended and became the pupil of one of the priests, a monk for three decades,132 who was "one of the city's leading citizens and the generation's great scholars, well versed in logic [hokhmat ha-ma'amar] and prudent in inner wisdom."'33 At one point, the priest presented Jacob with a general religious problem: how long would the Jews continue to reject Christianity as they diminished in number and lived abject lives, in contrast to the greatness and glory of Christendom. As proof of the Christian truth, and as an opening sal- vo in their debate, the priest pointed to the books of Paul, Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory the Great. He asked Jacob to abandon Judaism if he was unable to refute his arguments, and emphasized his willingness to answer any and all questions Ja- cob asked without apprehension.134 It is impossible to know how accurately Mil- hamot ha-Shem reflects the dispute that actually took place. Jacob ben Reuben's book contains a vigorous critique, including an attack on the Gospels and the tenets of Christianity. This might be explained by its unprecedented nature and by the pe- riod in which it was written: prior to the aggressive missionary activity of the Men- dicants.135 It is also to be ascribed to the friendly relations that existed between Ja- cob and the priest, and to the explicit agreement on the part of the latter that he give voice to anything that came to mind. All these factors might have informed the aggressiveness of the writing. At the same time, Jacob was apprehensive enough of public disclosure of his claims against Christianity that he was careful not to publish everything that was on his mind.136 Different conditions characterized the series of debates and general discus- 130. The grammarian and biblical interpretor Jonah ibn Janah testified about these disputes. See Wilhelm W.

The Archbishop of Nar- bonne was also the feudal lord of one part of the Jewish community in Narbonne.'37 Thus, religious debates over such issues as the lending of money, interest, and the Jewish badge had direct relevance to the daily lives of the Jews. Guilllaume de Broue sought to implement the prohibition against interest imposed on the Jews by the French king, Louis IX. In one of his three disputes with him, Meir ben Simeon argued that no society could exist without interest-carrying loans. He il- lustrated his point with the actions of the king himself, who was compelled to bor- row at high interest from Narbonne's Jews in order to relieve some of his fortified cities in war (apparently against the baron of Toulouse, Raymond VII). Why, asked ben Simeon, don't the feudal lords understand that, like them, the majority of the population also required Jewish loans. Claims similar to ben Simeon's were to be heard in Louis IX's court, expressed by those opposed to his program.'38 Gui Fulcodi sought to implement the decision of the Fourth Lateran Coun- cil (1215) regarding the identifying sign Jews were required to wear on their cloth- ing.139 Officially, his reason was the rumor about Jews having sexual relations with Christian prostitutes on the roads. Meir ben Simeon did not deny the accusation. He noted that implementing the decision would put Jews in grave danger from ban- dits, and that honest Jews should not be punished for the deeds of the sinners. He further added that those immoral Jews would not be deterred from contact with Christian prostitutes by an identifying badge: they dress like Christians, commit crimes with prostitutes, eat non-kosher foods in the company of Christians, and drink forbidden wine. As well they act in this way also in large towns, and not only on the roads, as the archbishop had been informed. 40 In the disputes, Fulcodi attacked issues raised in the Talmud as part of the general polemic waged against the Talmud in the thirteenth century. His arguments were taken from the convert Nicholas Donin, who represented Christianity in the Paris disputation. 141 Other scholars from his entourage also participated in the dis- putes. They intervened on various issues, presented their opinions, and demanded answers .'142 In addition, the archbishop sought to bring the Jews closer to conver- 137. See J.

Thus, for example, he pointed to the changing social and intellectual character of the class of converts. In the past, only those on the margins of Jewish society converted. Now, the com- munity's intellectuals and wealthy were converting. This phenomenon should open the eyes of the Jews and show them that those same converted scholars had cho- sen the fruit (Christianity) and now wished to throw out the peel (Judaism).143 De- spite the feudal dependence of the Jews on the archbishop, and despite the deteri- oration in the attitude of the rulers in Narbonne toward the Jews, Meir ben Simeon praised the government of the Archbishop Gui Fulcodi and his willingness to ac- cept and implement Jewish demands presented in meetings and debates.144 He even claims that his replies to the archbishop were a source of pleasure to the latter.145 Meir ben Simeon engaged other Christians in dispute as well. To one of these disputes he devotes the second half of Milhemet Misvah.146 It addressed the clas- sic issues such as the Christological interpretation of Biblical prophecy, the Trin- ity, Incarnation, the virgin birth, and Jewish exile. Another section of the work pre- sents a critique of the New Testament. As in the dispute with the archbishop of Narbonne, here, too, arguments were based on historical events or on contempo- rary reality: the crusades and their failure,147 the split in the Christian world be- tween the Latin and Greek churches,148 the religious debate between Christianity and Islam,149 and Christian heresy and the sects that had brought about a weak- ening of the Catholic faith.'50 He employed these same arguments in his dispute 143. Chazan, Archbishop, p. 593. 144. Ibid., p. 589. In my opinion the partial satisfaction by the Archbishops De Broue and Ful- codi of the requests of the Jews, and their defense they provided them, is to be explained by the lengthy struggle between the archbishops and the Viscount in Narbonne over the jurisdiction over the Jews in Narbonne. See Regn&amp; Etude, pp. 106-114, especially pp. 108-109 for the confrontation (in Decem- ber, 1251) between Guillaume de Broue and the Viscount, which reached the point where Amauri I was excommunicated. 145.

No dialogue exists in the chapter, and it is devoted to the arguments of Meir ben Simeon, apparently a summary of several dis- putes. Only occasionally is a Christian voice to be heard, as happens on page 317: "One of their schol- ars replied to this."

While acknowledging that confession was necessary to everyone, he took issue with the way it was instituted. He had two reasons. Continued confes- sion to the same priest leads to a situation in which shame will inhibit people from confessing all their sins; as a consequence, according to the Christian view, that person's soul will be lost. Secondly, the priest, who is often young and in his prime, learns of sins from those confessing, sins he might then commit himself once his impulses are awakened. If married women confess their adultery to him, those impulses may lead him to have sexual relations with them, which could result in the birth of children. As a result, Christian society suffers from the moral failings of illicit sexual behavior and the loss of property to illegitimate sib- lings.' 52 Of particular note here are the pointed accusations concerning the im- morality of priests and suspicions of their adultery. Such a claim could easily pro- voke Christian ire, as indeed occurred around this time in Manosque (1265). A Jew by the name of Mancippus disputed over the subject with several Christians. He defended the superiority of the Jewish system of repentance, and presented the de- fects of the Christian confession which pretended to atone for all types of sins, in- cluding murder and adultery. His mention of the possibility of sexual relations be- tween a priest and loose women brought about an accusation against him in Manosque's court on charges of vilification. Joseph Shatzmiller has noted the close similarity between a passage in the work Sefer Nisahon Yashan and the case in Manosque, demonstrating the relationship between actual debates and the polemical literature.' 53 The subject of confession also arose in the dispute between Meir ben Sime- on and the Archbishop Fulcodi, in which ben Simeon emphasized the importance of daily confession over confessions made only during a certain period of the year, as was the Christian practice.154 Ben Simeon also attacked the different forms of atonement imposed by the priest on the sinner in cases of serious transgressions, 151. See Milhemet misvah, 1, 3, Herskowitz edition, pp. 110-111. Meir ben Simeon shows himself to also be conscious of the methods the Church used in its struggle against the Catharist heresy.

At the turn of the thirteenth century, Solomon ben Abraham ibn Adret (the Rashba) held a series of disputations with a Christian. The Rashba responded to arguments that were part of the "new polemic" developed at the time by the Men- dicants of Raymond Martini's school. The Rashba later made a record of the de- bates in a polemical work.'58 Jeremy Cohen's claim that the Christian who dis- puted with the Rashba was Raymond Martini himself is convincing. Cohen based his conclusion primarily on an analysis of the Rashba's arguments that were a re- sponse to an attack on Judaism found in Martini's work Pugio fidei.159 No de- tailed descriptions of the Rashba's disputant's arguments exist (the Christian's ar- guments are abbreviated while the Rashba's answers are provided at length), but it is important to note that no mention is made of hostility or treachery on the part of Martini or the Dominicans. It can be assumed that the debates'60 were part of the Mendicants' missionary program which, alongside physical and psychologi- cal pressure on the Jewish communities, sought to hold debates with important Jewish figures who, once convinced of the Christian truth, would bring about mass conversion. However, it seems that in this case outside pressures (such as the ac- tivities of the Dominicans in the streets of Barcelona in 1263) were not involved, nor was there any official compulsion on the Jewish representative to appear and debate. Martini presented harsh challenges whose purpose was to represent me- dieval Judaism as a new religion, wholly distinct from that which God had com- manded at Mt. Sinai. This was an attempt to establish Judaism as heresy, and the Rashba devoted the greater part of his polemic to countering these claims. He also went on the offensive, attacking the concept of the Trinity in philosophical lan- guage. Martini had difficulty answering these attacks, and his rebuttal-that phi- losophy is not to be used in establishing religious truths, since it raises difficulties 155.

From this it can be concluded that Martini, known from Pugiofidei for his demonic per- ception of Judaism,'62 still considered Judaism to be a positive religion, if only for argument's sake. His rejection of philosophical rationalism as a language rel- evant to such religious discussion diverges from the polemical methods of such thinkers as Anselm of Canterbury, Gilbert Krispin, and Peter Abelard.163 On the other hand, it accords with Thomas Aquinas' stand on the matter. 64 It was an au- thentic theological position and not an ad hoc tactic for dismissing the Rashba's arguments. Indeed, Martini advanced a similar argument in a dispute held in Tunisia with Sultan Al-Mustansir, as can be seen from Raymond Llull's attacks on him.165 At the same time, it is also possible that Martini acted on the basis of his awareness of the Rashba's views concerning the dangers of philosophy; such views would find expression a few years later in the ban imposed by Rashba and other Barcelona scholars in 1305 against radical philosophical allegory.166 Be that as it may, Rashba tried at one point in the dispute to reach agreement with Marti- ni, at least regarding Judaism's and Christianity's need to reject heresy.'67 An entirely different atmosphere prevailed in the dispute between Moses ha- Cohen of Tordesillas and a Christian student of the converted scholar, Abner of Burgos (Alphonso de Valladolid), who arrived in Avila at the same time the four official disputes had been held in the cathedral.

But the latter compelled ha-Cohen to do so by threatening to join one of the two other converts and compel the entire Jewish community to return to the cathedral, for a fifth time, to hear Christian preaching.168 He further indicated that he intended to include a forceful anti-Jewish message in his sermon, one that could inflame the feelings of the Christian audience. These threats ulti- mately convinced ha-Cohen to agree to a private dispute. It took place in ha- Cohen's home, before an audience of his students,169 and was reported in 'Ezer ha-Emunah.170 The Christian, who was well-versed in the Old Testament and in Talmudic legends after having read Abner of Burgos' work, More ha-Sedek, made use of the same potent attacks against the Talmud concerning the Jewish insult of Jesus and the Jews' negative attitude toward Christians that were, in part, known from the Paris disputation. Ha-Cohen hoped to use the private dispute to avoid the public airing of these claims. He understood that even if he were to triumphantly rebut them, the very existence of the official dispute caused automatic damage to the Jewish community since Christian society comprehended and internalized in particular the points made against the Jews and paid less attention to the defense. Among the various arguments and counter-arguments we find the anony- mous disputant's efforts to refute ha-Cohen's response concerning the verse "For unto us a child is born" (Isaiah 9:5) by invoking a midrashic interpretation that seems to have been unknown to the polemicizing converts who participated in the earlier public disputes.17 This is interesting testimony to the impact of the offi- cial disputations, as the arguments raised in public later served as a basis for con- tinuing polemics in private disputes. The site of the dispute-ha-Cohen's home-and the fact that the Christian was not accompanied by an entourage distinguish this case from an official dis- pute, even as it took place under threat. It should be noted that several years earli- er, in 1305, Raymond Llull had already issued a call to hold religious disputes in the homes of Jews.172 Religious disputations between Jews and converts became increasingly com- mon as the number of conversions increased during the second half of the four- teenth century, and in particular in the wake of the pogroms of 1391, the Tortosa disputation, and the sermonizing crusade of Vincent Ferrer to Castile and Aragon in 1411-1415. Reverberations from these disputes are evidenced in the work Zelus Christi contra Judeos, Sarracenos et infidels, written by the convert Pedro de la Cablleria around 1464.'73 The disputes continued right up to the eve of the Ex- 168.

The epistle was already known as a genre of literary polemic from the first century in its use by St. Paul, and during the Middle Ages by such writers as Peter Damian and Sam- uel of Morocco.175 However, now we witness this genre being put to use in an ac- tual dispute between two, or more, persons responding to each other's arguments, often referring to real events of religious significance. This, too, is not entirely new, as in Islamic Cordoba during a much earlier period (around the year 840) epis- tles had been exchanged between Paul Alvarus and the proselyte Diacon Bodo (Eleazar). 176 In the fourteenth century Abner of Burgos sent three polemical epistles ad- dressing various subjects to three Jews. They were answered by the mathematician Joseph Shalom, under the instruction of the physician, Hayyim Israel bar Isaac of Toledo. Abner replied to Shalom's epistles in a specific work entitled Teshuvot ha- Meshuvot.177 In addition, he sent epistles to several of the elders of the Toledo community, in which he accused them of eating leavened food and not matzah dur- ing the first and second days of Passover in 1334. The implication was that they were heretics as they had wantonly transgressed against Jewish law without ac- 174. See, for instance, A.

Following conversion, Ab- ner sent Polgar an essay he wrote explicating his messianic thought. Polgar replied in an tract entitled by Abner 'Iggeret ha-Harafot. It contained personal attacks against Abner. The epistle was also circulated among the Jewish communities in Spain, with Abner replying to it in his book Teshuvot le-Meharef'180 In his work, Minhat Kena'ot, which was also written against Polgar, Abner complained about the former's delaying tactics in announcing that he is composing replies to Abner, but then not sending them to him. This was, in his opinion, an internal propagan- da device used by Jews to present a veneer of internal strength toward the exter- nal world that had no basis.'18 Despite the severity of Abner's claims against the Jews and Judaism, it appears that, on a personal level, he remained interested in the company of Jewish scholarly circles, respecting Joseph Shalom's attempt to re- turn fire.182 Indeed, it is because of Shalom's wisdom that Abner expects him to understand his arguments and convert.183 Following the pogroms of 1391 a religious dispute took place through a cor- 178. A section from the Epistle of Abner of Burgos as quoted in the work "Yesod 'olam" of Isaac ha-Israeli, in Rosenthal, Studies and Sources, 1, p. 363: "And as you do not revere this com- mandment and you render it void, so too you will be able to void all the commandments and accord- ingly you make a new law [nova lex], and you annul all the commandments ... And you say that the messiah still has not come, that he is a teacher of righteousness. You must wait for him and not inno- vate at all until he will come, but given that you have already begun to change the Torah each one of you will continue to fashion a new law according to his opinion; but we do not do so. There is no force great enough to lead us to make a change in the Torah other than that which our messiah, who is the teacher of righteousness, did" [my emphasis]. Stow, in Alienated Minority, pp. 258-259, dismisses the long-term importance of these accusations by the Popes Gregory IX (1239) and Clement IV (1267) ac- cording to which the talmud is "another law." He notes that such accusations were not made again, and thus the question of the deceitful rabbinic traditions was wisely put aside. The denunciation by Abner of Burgos suggests that Gregory IX's accusations received an attentive response in Spain. 179.

Baer rejects Abner's contention that he received "Iggeret ha-Harafot" only ten years after it was written. Rather, according to Baer, only then did Abner find suit- able political conditions for renewing the polemics. See Isaac Polgar, 'Ezer ha-dat, Part 1, Chapter Sev- en, p. 60: "Once I associated with a man, may my soul be redeemed, [who was] quick and knowing of the ways of religion and also philosophy ... His name previously was rabbi Abner ... And he said to me if you seek the faith of the sages, and not to pervert their ways, I will show you from their say- ings and illustrate from their evil counsels how the religion of the Jews which is important and deep in your heart, is worthless and mortal, like a woman divorced from her man, and that we need a new law [torah hadashah]." Abner of Burgos sought to prove the absurdity of the Jewish faith on the basis of talmudic legends. In response Isaac composed a general introduction which would allow him to avoid answering each point individually. See Isaac Polgar, 'Ezer ha-dat, pp. 60-65. 181.

Bonjorn attacked Duran for the latter's devotion to Judaism and his attempts to convince Bonjorn to return to Judaism. Duran replied to Bonjorn in the famous epistle, 'Al tehi ka-'avotekha.184 That doc- ument has recently been reinvestigated and, alongside the ironic theological polem- ic against Christianity, an intimate, personal critique of Bonjorn for abandoning central values (such as lineage) of high Jewish society in Spain-and especially the circle of courtiers in Perpignan-is also to be discerned.'85 Paul of Burgos and Joshua ha-Lorki also exchanged polemics. Paul com- posed a letter to Don Joseph Orabuena (the major rabbi of the kingdom of Navarre) in which he announced his acceptance of the fact that the messianic prophecies had been realized by Jesus. Ha-Lorki saw this letter, which was possibly intended from the beginning for public distribution. He wrote his friend an epistle contain- ing four possible explanations for converting, sixteen objections to Christianity, and a question about man's duty to search for the true faith.'86 In his reply Paul of Burgos did not provide rebuttals to all sixteen objections. Apparently, he was not ready to answer in such detail so soon after his conversion. He composed more complete answers years later (1434) in his work Scrutinium Scripturarum.'87 These epistolary disputes continued among the circle of Jewish poets whose leaders converted after the Tortosa disputation in the first half of the fifteenth cen- tury. Astruk Rimokh (Francesc de St. Jordi) wrote an epistle to Enshaltiel Bonfos after his conversion seeking to convince the latter to convert as well. Enshaltiel's reply has not survived. However, Solomon Bonafed, who remained faithful to Ju- daism, found flaws in his reply ("Mild things are said and not understood") and composed a severe reply to Rimokh that included a discussion of Christology and of redemption from original sin, and mocked transubstantiation, the cult of the saints, and the notion of confession.'88 He added a poem to the epistle which in- cluded an attack on Christianity for being an irrational religion."89 In addition, the exchange of poems between Bonafed and the converted poet Isaac Adret, although primarily clashing over the nature of their poetry, also contains allusions to reli- gious disputations.190 As a rule, Bonafed kept on friendly terms with the group of converted poets, particularly with Solomon da Piera and Don Vidal ben Lavi, and he tried to maintain, as much as was possible, their professional ties as poets. 184.

An anonymous Christian scholar enquired of a Jewish scholar why the Jews demand that a convert divorce his wife if she remains a Jew. He added that the Jews must consider converts to be dead, and therefore their wives should be considered widows. The first then re- sponded by saying that a Jew could not alter his substance as a Jew, and that con- version is a mere accident, with only an external expression such as a change of name or even a change in the divine presence (shekhina) that dwells within him. The subjects under dispute were later brought by the Jew to the attention of Isaac Arama. Arama remarked that, while his answer was a correct one according to the Jewish world view (in light of the prevailing interpretation of the talmudic state- ment, "Even though he has sinned he remains a Jew"),191 it would not be accept- able to the Christian. The latter could then reply that a person's substance and essence is religion, and once he has left his original religion he could no longer be considered a member. Arama then offered his own response to this question, for future disputes. He insisted that divorce from the convert be justified not on the basis of the couple's religion, but on their very humanity-they were, after all, people with an intimate connection (hibbur) between them that needed to be an- nulled. 92 This event sheds light on the dynamic of the Jewish-Christian discourse and on the effects of the private disputes in the Jewish communities. The Chris- tian arguments were seriously considered, and the engagement with the issues con- tinued after the specific dispute was over. Disputants occasionally turned to au- thorities in Torah and polemics in order to clarify whether their arguments stood the test of Jewish religious law and philosophy. The ongoing discussion led them to formulate more convincing answers for future encounters. 93 One of the most important polemicists of the fifteenth century was Hayyim ibn Musa, who frequently engaged Christians in discussion and debate.194 In his work, Magen va-Romah (1456), he describes two private religious disputes that took place in a tolerant atmosphere. In the first, he encountered a priest and a knight. The priest asked: If you Jews really do follow God's Bible, why have you not been restored to your country? Ibn Musa replied that the Jews lost their coun- try because of the sins of previous generations, and that they presently await re- demption, according to the promises of the prophets. In addition, he exhorted: You Christians, who claim that the confession cleanses you and absolves you of sin, 191. Sanhedrin, 44a. See J.

According to your doctrine and views, you are deserving of pos- sessing the messiah's grave and the sites of the Passion where Jesus suffered to re- deem you from hell.195 The knight then gave an answer that startled, and silenced, both ibn Musa and the priest: Where in the land of the Christians did you ever see Jews or Christians hon- oring their houses of worship as the Ishmaelites do, in purity, with the Tem- ple of Solomon [Templum Salomonis; or the Al Aqusa Mosque], and all the places which we value? Rather, in the churches, during the nights of vigil, they will lie with women, and they host there murderers and thieves and evil-doers, and from there the gentiles shoot arrows and projectiles [ballistraot] at one another, and there they murder one another, like the Jews once did in the Tem- ple.196 The Jews too degrade the honor of their house of worship, and because of this the blessed holy name wanted that all would be in the hands of the Ish- maelites who value these [places], and maintain them ... and that was also why God did not want it to be in our hands. Then we were both silent, the priest and I.1"7 The knight's statement, as recorded by ibn Musa, is unusual both in Jewish and Christian polemical literature. Its source was an unlearned lay channel, based not on the Holy Scriptures or verses of the Prophets but on personal experience and "popular" wisdom. This was precisely the type of disputation that the Church sought to prevent through its regulations, as we saw above.198 The knight's claims contained a pointed social critique of both Christians and Jews. His testimony to the manner in which the Muslims respect the holy places was based on what he himself had witnessed during his pilgrimage in the company of the same priest.199 It is possible that his statement also reflected some measure of tolerance, since, in condemning both religions, he accorded Judaism an equal-if negative-position. The various aspects of the knight's answer can be compared to other polem- ical arguments that circulated in unlearned channels, as recently studied by Ora Limor. The knowledge of laymen, such as merchants, concerning issues of faith was inferior to that of churchmen, and they preferred to focus on more narrow, everyday issues. The general tone of their disputes was calm, and at times friend- 195. Sefer magen va-romah, p. 103. The question posed by ibn Mussa to the knight was not a new one. It served Jewish polemicists since the thirteenth century. See, for instance, the despute in Y. Rosenthal, "A Religious Dispute," p. 65: "Since you are redeemed why doesn't he [Jesus] redeem his pit [the Holy Sepulchre] from the Ismaelites and deliver it into your hands, for you do not have any au- thority [rashut] over it."

In several instances they sought to show that the differences between the reli- gions were not great, recognizing the advantages mutual trust gave in trying to con- vince the other side.200 The Genoese merchant Inghetto Contardo, for example, made light of the importance of Christian symbols such as the cross and figures in order to create goodwill and openness among his Jewish discussants.201 It would seem that the knight's statement fits nicely into this type of polemic conducted by merchants, for its openness, the type of argument it presented, and the attempt to encompass in it both religions. Even the freedom he felt in strongly criticizing the Church was not unusual among lay scholars in Europe, as evidenced, for instance, in the stories of the Decameron.202 Ibn Musa's second dispute was also characterized by an atmosphere of tol- erance. The encounter took place in the home of a Christian "lord" whom ibn Musa apparently served as a physician. His opponent was "one of their wise scholars."203 The Christian opened by attacking the lack of interest the Jews show in theology: "Do you know that the Jews have but one book of theology, whose name is Moreh Nevukhim, while we have so many books of theology that a large palace could not fit them all."204 Ibn Musa chose to keep silent until the lord asked him to reply. In response he claimed that the Jews have no need for many works of theology, but can make do with just one page, on which are recorded the thirteen principles of Jewish belief, as determined by Maimonides.205 Most of these principles, ibn Musa continued, are shared by the Christians. Two or three provoke "some disso- nance [safeq]" between the religions, and over the idea of unity there exists "com- plete dissonance." As for the unity, the Christians divided the substance of God into three. On the principle of insubstantiality, they declared that "the son was sub- stantiated, but after his death all returned to one God." On the non-changing na- 200. See O.

These are, after all, rooted in differences over the in- terpretation of the Bible. On one series of issues, however, he believed that no ra- tional debate could take place: To believe that God cannot atone for man's original sin except through his own death; and that he was incarnated in the belly of a woman; and that he did not find the wisdom to atone for this sin except through his death; and that he suf- fered so much disgrace and pain until he died; and despite all this all sons of the earth die, and go to hell, the Christians and the wicked. All the books in the world will not place this at all in the scholars' minds, and especially those who have grown up in the Torah, [which is] far from all those beliefs, and is perfect in its human, domestic, and civic leadership. And therefore the Jew does not need but a single page of theology, since all his faith agrees with reason.208 In keeping with polemical tradition dating to the time of Judah ha-Levi, ibn Musa rejected the Christian doctrine on the grounds of its illogic.209 And here the dispute ended. It is told that the two disputants fell silent, and the lord, who was strongly affected by his answer, asked that they cease since it may provoke doubts in his faith.210 The phenomenon of Jewish courtiers participating in disputes while serving in the court as physicians, scientists, or administrators was common in Spain. The physician--astrologer Shemarya of Negroponte came to the court of the king of Castile, Alphonso XI, and engaged the scholars of Salamanca in debate on eso- teric issues related to alchemy and the secrets of physics.21 1 This was probably the background to the dispute that took place before King Juan II of Aragon between the philosopher Abraham Bibago and a Christian scholar;212 it is also the context 206.

Few cases of the conversion of those born as Christians took place in Spain,217 and fewer still in Germany, England, and France.218 There is no 99a: "What happened to me with one amazing scholar in my youth at the table of the king, Don Juan, in the kingdom of Aragon." The Christian opened the dispute and asked Bibago if he considered himself a philosopher. Bibago responded that he was not a philosopher but a Jew who believes in the Torah, which has a considerable element of philosophical wisdom. If that is so, asked the Christian, then why do you not believe in incarnation of God and in the death by crucifixion, which atones. Bibago responded that this conception is impossible. "And there is no faith in what is impossible." The Christian sought to show, according to the Aristotelian view, that the Jews believe in a different "impossibility," the creation of the world, which contradicts the Aristotelian proof of eternity. Therefore, in his opinion, they must also believe in the Christological "impossibility," or absurdum. Bibago responded that according to Maimonides' view the Aristotelian eternity of the world is not a proof but an assumption. Likewise, the Christological "im- possibility" spoils the perfection of God, and the "impossibility" presented by the Christian concerning the creation of the world presents the perfection of God.

Still my faith is true, according to our tradition, and my faith is not diminished if you do not be- lieve."220 At the same time, one cannot rule out the possibility that Jews succeed- ed in raising doubts among Christians, 221 just as Christian sermons and disputes had a not-insignificant success among the Jews. We have seen how the preacher provoked uncertainties among Lerida's Jews.222 In addition, both Isaac Arama and Joseph Ya'aves noted the great attraction the Christian sermons had.223 Jewish con- versions in the wake of official disputes, such as that of Tortosa,224 are known to have happened, and there were probably others that followed private disputes as well.225 One of these was the converso Bonit Bonjorn, who apparently converted 1961), pp. 288-315, which studies approximately forty cases of conversion, and estimates that the ex- tent of the phenomenon reached into the hundreds.

Especially interesting in this context are those arguments reflective of contemporary reality, which were completely absent from the official disputes that centered around interpretations of texts. Examples would include the remarks of Archbishop Gui Fulcodi concerning the changed economic-intellectual stratum of Jews who were converting to Christianity, and the arguments of Meir ben Sime- on regarding the interest-bearing loans taken by Louis IX and about the attitude of the Church towards heresy. Isaac Arama sought to refute the deterministic per- ception of the Christian preacher by pointing to the reality of repentance by cer- tain prominent people. The bishop who debated ibn Caspi in Provence attacked the Jewish practice of exhibiting the Torah in receptions held for Christian dignitaries (kings, popes, and bishops) entering the city. He contended that Christian religious implements would suffice, and that if they so much wanted to include a Torah in the reception, it should be in a Latin translation used by Christians. The Hebrew language in his eyes was no holier a source for the bible than was Latin. This led ibn Caspi to argue for the superiority of the Hebrew original over the Latin trans- lation. He provided an example from the lives of Jews and Christians in the Mid- dle Ages, pointing to the privileges Jews received from kings. The Jews make copies of the privileges ("vidimus"); however the value of these copies in the roy- al court is much lower than that of the original. They suffer a special devaluation if translated into a language different from that spoken by the king. These differ- ences between original and copy demonstrated, in ibn Caspi's opinion, the superi- ority of the Hebrew Bible.229 The monk who engaged in debate with Jacob ben 226.

However, in the thirteenth century, after the scale of the cru- sades' failure became known, Jewish disputants such as Meir ben Simeon used it to illustrate the gulf between biblical prophecy, which was applied to the Cru- saders, and the Muslim victories. He emphasized in particular the surrender of the King of Sidon,232 the sinking of crusader ships,233 and, more than anything, the fall of Antioch (1268), which had been the symbol of Crusader rule in Syria.234 He believed that the crusades and the wars in the holy land were testimony to the non-fulfillment of the redemption the Christians sought to claim.235 He also point- ed to the deaths of Christians in the wars and to the vast sums of money spent in redeeming prisoners from the Muslims.236 He believed, in addition, that the cru- sades were the cause of moral flaws in Christian society, such as the postponement of the repayment of the loans, leading them to take false oaths. This transgression caused their failure in war.237 .Hayyim ibn Musa also attacked Christianity, by describing Muslim control over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Christian holy sites, and Joseph ibn Caspi discussed contemporary knightly laws when he described how kings and aristocrats were supposed to surrender only to those of an equal social stature. The religious dispute was sometimes mistakenly considered by modern scholars to be fossilized, with each generation merely recapitulating the same ar- guments. However, the testimony examined here underlines the dynamic quality of the private dispute and its relationship to daily life. 230. Milhamot ha-Shem, Chapter Two, p. 60 231.

This tendency to minimize the differences was both an effective means of persua- sion and an expression of the personal relationship between the disputants, which was missing in the official disputes. This phenomenon was to be found in Spain. For example, it was attested by the Christian disputant, the author of "Declarante de los judios," and was already described in accounts of disputes involving Mediterranean merchants and in accounts of the religious polemic in the Decameron.240 The Chris- tian who engaged Meir ben Simeon in debate was allegedly swayed by the strength of the arguments of his opponent, consequently reaching the conclusion that every man must live according to his own beliefs, and that the Lord will repay each ac- cording to his actions.241 His remarks accord with those of ben Simeon concerning the recompense appropriate to each person (be he Christian or Jew) for his actions both in this world and the next.242 Ben Simeon often emphasized the importance of the universal nature of Judaism, and Judaism's concern for the material and spiritu- al well-being of humanity.243 Ibn Caspi pointed to a common basis for the Chris- tian and Jewish conception of God: both believed in an awesome and magnificent God, in the company of a retinue of frightening seraphim and angels. Raymond Martini's arguments concerning the threat posed by rational philos- ophy to all positivist religions also deviates from the venomous polemic found in Pu- giofidei in that it places Christianity and Judaism on an equal footing, if only to ar- gue against their common enemy. His interlocutor, the Rashba, fully identified with Christianity's condemnation of heresy. Hayyim ibn Musa narrowed the points of dis- agreement between Jews and Christians, contending that in most of the articles of faith (dogmas) there was no difference between the religions. The knight with whom he disputed placed Christianity and Judaism on the same plane, if only to criticize the respective neglect of synagogues and churches while pointing to Islam's success in the Holy Land. The silence of both ibn Musa and the priest was a deafening one when juxtaposed to the knight's preaching. It was particularly dramatic in light of the knight's forcible moral attack on Christians and the Church, common in contempo- rary Christian lay circles. The Church sought to silence such claims by forbidding lay persons from engaging in disputes. However, they could not be entirely suppressed. 238. Milhemot ha-Shem, Chapter 1, p. 10 239.

His words are ironic, extending Christian assumptions to their absurd end. It goes without saying that he could not have presented such arguments in an official dispute such as that held in Barcelona or Tortosa. In many courtier debates the thin line distinguishing private and public dis- putes became blurred. The site of the dispute-and it did not matter whether it was the king's court or a nobleman's home-together with the specific ruling authority supervising and even participating in the dispute created unwritten rules that put the Jew in a more difficult position than when the dispute was held in more neutral sur- roundings, for instance in the home of Moses ha-Cohen of Tordesillas before his stu- dents, or in a gathering of Christian and Jewish scholars, as in Isaac Arama's dispute. In many of the written accounts of the disputes, the Jewish participant pre- sented his Christian rival as a great scholar, sometimes praising his wisdom in vivid imagery and words of praise. Something similar is to be found in Christian works.244 Was this a literary convention by which the greater the praise given one's opponent, the greater one's own wisdom in overcoming such a talented disputant? While such reasoning cannot be dismissed out of hand, it is also likely that there was an element of authenticity here, as scholars of the same intellectual milieu conversed and debated each other. Thus the physician and translator Leon Joseph of Carcassone attests, in 1394, in his description of the disputes that took place in Provence between Christian physicians and Jewish physicians. He notes, on one hand, that the physician was the only Jewish figure to be accorded significant re- spect in Christian society. On the other hand, and perhaps because of that fact, an ongoing conflict developed with Christian physicians, the latter searching for any possible way to dishonor their Jewish colleagues. To confound such efforts, Leon Joseph sought to translate into Hebrew the latest developments in medicine that had been publicized among the Christians, particular in the faculty of medicine in Montpellier. He tells of the difficulties he encountered in acquiring the works (in Montpellier, Avignon, and other places known to be centers of learning) be- cause of the small amount of extant copies in existence, but principally because of the prohibition declared by Christian scholars against anyone selling medical texts in Latin to Jews.245 The Christian prohibition on the sale of books to Jews can be explained as part of the professional struggle waged both in academia and in practice.246 The struggle revolved around the acquisition of the most exact pos- 244.

Part of the conflict was over those same restrictions (usually ignored) that prohibited Christians from being treated by Jewish physicians. See, for instance, L. Stouff, "Chr6tiens et Juifs dans l'Arles du bas Moyen Age: Leurs relations," Les societies urbaines en France m#ridionale et en penin- sule ibirique au Moyen Age, Actes du colloque Pau, 21-23 septembre 1988 (Paris, 1991), pp. 525- 528.

A practical expression of the competi- tion over this knowledge is to be found in the medical polemics which were car- ried out between physicians from both sides. The encounters were over such neutral issues as science and medicine; however, victory or defeat in scientific de- bate had a direct relation to the respective religious community of the participants. Leon Joseph wrote that reading the two important works (Gerard de Solo and Jean de Tournemire) which he succeeded in acquiring after great effort and consider- able expense would help "to stand up to Christian physicians in struggles and de- bates."247 He estimated that "with those books the Christian positions will become as nothing.. . if [the Jews] read them often . .. they will not fear the voice of the driver who strikes them with the staff of medicine. Because they will be able to fight their battles, they will not fear the crowd of physicians, although they in- clude [their] sages."248 Studying the "other's" holy writings (the Talmud and rabbinical texts, on the one hand, the New Testament and the Church Fathers, on the other), while largely intended as an aid in preparing one's own polemics but also deriving from cultur- al curiosity,249 informed these disputes.250 As seen above, the Jewish disputant often engaged a learned priest, a preach- er, bishop, or cardinal while in other instances, such as the dispute between Hay- yim ibn Musa and the knight, particularly unorthodox arguments were to be heard. I believe that these accounts can be trusted, and that most of the private disputes documented by Jewish sources were scholarly encounters. This was also appar- ently one of the reasons for the absence of defamations and slurs characteristic of Jewish-Christian disputations in Northern Europe, as expressed in such books as Sefer Nisahon Yashan and Sefer Yosef ha-Mekane.251 The dispute between Isaac Arama and the Christian preacher is an instance of a private philosophical engagement over questions of faith. In official disputes, such as that held in Tortosa, the philosophical syllogism was a potent weapon in the hands of the Christian representative. According to what was written in Shevet Yehudah, the Jews sought to end the dispute by claiming that they did not subscribe 247. Leon Joseph, "Introduction," p. 428. 248. Ibid. 249.

See the anonymous passage that was published by Marmorstein, "David Kimhi," p. 250: "It is also written there that Jesus ate the Passover on the eve of his crucifixion, and that in that year the Passover was brought on a Friday and he was crucified the next day (i.e., Saturday); this is a com- plete falsehood, for they would not kill a man on a holy day. And so in the Talmud they say that it was not even on the evening before the evening of Passover, and I had already asked one of them who is knowledgeable of the Gospel[s] and he told me that he does not understand this [my emphasis]." 251. See Berger, Vetus Nizzahon, pp. 21-22; Rosenthal, "Introduction," p. 28 makes note of the popular character of "Sefer Yosef Hamekane" in contrast to the philosophical discussion in Milhemot ha-Shem of Jacob ben Reuben; and D.J. Lasker, "Jewish Philosophical Polemics in Ashkenaz," in Limor, Contra Judaeos, especially pp. 197-198, 210-213. However, learned debate was not absent in Ashkenaz. See Lasker, pp. 203-212; the private disputation between Christian and Jewish scholars in Ger- many in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was discussed by Ben-Sasson, Jewish-Christian Disputa- tion, pp. 380-385, and see n. 45. 67</page><page sequence="46">Ram Ben Shalom to "the ways of syllogism and logic."252 As early as 1311, Raymond Llull had sug- gested that sermons imposed on Jews adopt syllogistic reasoning so that they be better understood. He emphasized persuasion that appealed to the intellect,253 and also demanded that selected Jews be compelled to study Latin grammar, logic, and Christian philosophy in order to make it possible to persuade them in religious dis- pute.254 Already in the thirteenth century, as we saw above, Solomon bar Moses had proposed that Jews avoid disputes with Christian scholastics. Similarly, Hay- yim ibn Musa, who had internalized the lessons from the Tortosa disputation, re- peated the warning against participating in a scholastic dispute based on logic; he recommended adhering to the literal interpretations of the verses instead. Ibn Musa even advocated to disputants that they condition their participation on the non-appearance of philosophical knowledge (hokhmot hisoniot).255 Even Abra- ham Bibago, in the second half of the fifteenth century, and Joseph Ya'aves, from the generation of the Expulsion, acknowledged the superiority of Christian philosophers.256 At first glance, this is an odd phenomenon. The Jews of Spain and Provence were learned in philosophy and, as Daniel Lasker has shown, while preferring to not directly confront Christian scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas and Anselm of Canterbury, they knew how to adopt philosophical prem- ises in religious disputes.257 An impressive example of Jewish knowledge of Aris- totelian philosophy and scholastic discourse is found in the private polemic over the Trinity that was held in Castile between Joseph ben Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov and a great Christian scholar.258 252. See Shevet Yehudah, p. 96. 253. Johnston, "Ramon Llull," pp. 31-32, and n. 105, according to Petitio Raymundi in Con- cilio generali: "et quod sermones reducantur ad syllogismum et ad intelligibile ... quia intellectus magis se delectat et se impraegnat per intelligere, quam per credere."

Shalom aimed his remarks to the general Jewish public rather than to a select group of Jew- ish philosophers such as Hasdai Crescas, Joseph Albo, Joseph ben Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov, Abraham Bibago, and Isaac Arama. These last were versed in Christian scholasticism, and knew the intricacies of Aristotelian philosophy.261 The gap be- tween those acquainted with scholasticism and logic and those who were not was to be found in the second rung of intellectuals, who were sometimes even asked to represent Judaism in private religious disputes. Many of them, as Shalom point- ed out, preferred the Kabbalah to philosophical studies. Others considered philos- ophy to be an Averroistic heresy.262 This left the Christians with the advantage in religious disputes as Jewish scholars lacked the requisite knowledge to effective- ly engage them. As a consequence of the crisis in the study of the new philosophy that was also noted by Solomon Bonafed,263 several Jewish scholars, principally from Aragon, worked in the second half of the fifteenth century alongside Abraham Shalom in order to improve the situation by bringing Latin scholasticism to their readership.264 Abraham's grandfather, Judah ben Samuel Shalom, had already translated Summulae Logicals of Peter Hispanus (in 1449), and noted the Chris- tians' pride in their innovations in logic as the motivation for his translation.265 Eli 259.

While there exists a gap of several decades between textual testimonies to the private dis- putes, the overall impression that emerges from a review of the evidence is that they were common events. See above, notes nos. 103, 106. Joseph ibn Shem Tov, for instance, alludes to several disputes which he had with Christians. See Perush 'al zot ha-'iggeret, p. 26. Like ibn Caspi and others, ibn Shem Tov did not record the dispute as it actually happened, but edited it to suit his literary needs. In the royal court he engaged in dispute with Christians whom he referred to as priests, governors. See Regev, "Doubts" (He- brew), pp. 263-264; and above n. 204. See also below n. 285 on the same phenomenon in Italy in 1423. 261. See Pines, Between the Thought of Israel, pp. 178-276, especially pp. 220-222. 262. Hakdamat ha-ma'atik, pp. 5-6. 263. It seems that decline in the study of logic in Spain and Provence began in the second half of the fourteenth century. It can be attributed in part to the encounter with the new Chrisitan logic, which undermined the foundations of the Arabic-Hebrew tradition. Bonafed, who studied the new logic with a Christian scholar, testified to its superiority and to the urgent need of Jews to learn it. He also noted the superior translations to which Christian now had access. See S. Rosenberg, "Logic and Ontologic in Jew- ish Philosophy in the Fourteenth Century (Ph.D. dissertation, Hebrew University, 1974), pp. 32, 37-39; Gross, "The Poet," pp. 35-36; H.

Rosenberg, "Barbara Celarent in Hebrew Dress 69</page><page sequence="48">Ram Ben Shalom ben Joseph Habillo translated numerous scholastic texts from Latin, including the innovations emanating from the University of Paris which found expression in the works of Johannes Versoris.266 Habillo was explicit about the superiority of Chris- tian philosophy (especially Thomas Aquinas) vis-a-vis Jewish philosophy.267 Sim- ilar expressions were made by Abraham ibn Nahmias (Ocafia, 1490), the translator of Aquinas' commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics, who extolled with superla- tives Thomas Aquinas, "the great philosopher," and the "foremost spokesman."268 In addition to Judah Shalom, Abraham Shalom, Habillo, and Nahmias, Abraham Bibago and Isaac Abravanel were active in this period.269 They were preceded by Azariah ben Joseph ben Abba Mari of Perpignan, who found refuge in Italy (ap- parently in the wake of the Tortosa disputation and the crusade of Vincent Ferrer) and who translated Boethius' work, Consolationes Philosophiae, in 1423, after having been impressed by the effective use Christian debaters made of it.270 (Mnemonic Hebrew Signs in the Method of Logic)," (Hebrew) Tarbiz, 48 (1979), p. 92: "When I saw that the book, which is called in their language Tractati, is good in the method of logic and shorter than the works of Aristotle, and also contains some new matters introduced by the Christian scholars of which they are proud, my spirit was awakened to translate it." 266. Habillo translated, for instance, Quaestiones de anima and Quaestiones disputate of Thomas Aquinas, and Summa totius logices and Quaestiones philosophicae of William of Occam, and perhaps De universalibus of Vincent de Beauvais. He also translated seven commentaries of Johannes Versoris, among others. See J.P.

See Eli ben Joseph Habillo, in the introduction to the translation of "Quaestiones in Physi- cam" of Johannes Versoris, Manuscript Paris, national library, heb. 1000, 4a-5a: "For among them [the Christians] there are very subtle matters that are unknown to the philosophers of our nation, al- though many [of the Jewish philosophers] hold their apostate notions."

See Rosenberg, "Logic," p. 46 on Abraham Farissol's logic and the connection to religious disputes. 70</page><page sequence="49">The Case of Christian Spain and Provence in the Late Middle Ages The Jewish-Christian polemic, it can be concluded, was, inter alia, an im- portant influence on the direction of Jewish knowledge and wisdom in the fifteenth century.271 The official encounter was not necessarily the most important factor here. After Tortosa in 1413-1414, such disputes almost ceased to take place in Spain. Rather, it was the private dispute which was common alongside coerced ser- mons, and which often brought about demoralization in the Jewish camp, that also had the effect of invigorating Jewish learning, as Jewish spokespersons sought new ways of defending their ancient tradition. It seems that the private disputes may also have served as an effective means of reducing the social tensions prevailing between Jews and Christians. Each group could emerge victorious in its own eyes, and could present their triumphs to their respective publics. This dynamic, alongside additional social mechanisms in medieval society, might also have contributed to decreasing Christian violence against the Jewish population. 271. An important expression is found in the course of study prepared by Rabbi Judah ben Joseph ibn Bolat, an exile from Spain, in his work "Kelal Kasar." Among the required subjects of study he includes the polemical literature of the Christians. Likewise, he places special emphasis on Aris- totelian logic as a requisite instrument in disputations with Christians. See Judah ben Joseph ibn Bolat, Kelal qasar, in A Memorial for the Gaon ha-Sadik Rabbi Abraham Isaac ha-Cohen Kook, a Biblical- Scientific Collection, (Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1937), pp. 26-31, 44-45. 71</page></plain_text>
