<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shelly Tenenbaum. A Credit to Their Community: Jewish Loan Societies in the United States, 1880-1945. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993. 204 pp. Shelly Tenenbaum has produced a short but well-written and well- documented study of philanthropic Jewish loan societies, particularly the Hebrew Free Loan Association movement, covering the period from their origins (around 1880) to their relative demise at the end of World War II. This was a crucial period in the economic advancement and Americanization of the Central and East European Jewish immigrants who started arriving in the United States in large numbers in the early 1880s. The loan associations may have played a pivotal role in their economic lives as entrepreneurs and consumers. In a capital-poor community with entrepreneurial skills and entrepreneurial opportunities, any access to low-cost capital (liquid assets) would be vital for business success. Tenenbaum is to be commended for literally getting her hands dirty digging out fascinating information from primary sources, association archival records. The Hebrew Free Loan Associations played the role of a "poor man's bank," but they were not for the indigent, for, as their name implies, they did not provide charity but rather loans that were to be repaid. Following the biblical injunction to not charge interest on loans to the Jewish poor (Exodus 22:24), the Hebrew Free Loan Associations generally charged no interest. Funds were raised from several sources, including dues from members who had voting rights but no special claim on loan funds, donations and bequests (especially from more wealthy German Jews), and, in the twentieth century, from Jewish Federations and community chests. Small, interest-free loans with a short repayment period (generally less than six months) were provided for business and personal purposes. Tenen- baum relates numerous instances of loans for acquiring a license, opening a store, buying tools, acquiring stock, etc. Moreover, loans, often to women,</page><page sequence="2">448 BOOK REVIEWS were made for special events, such as weddings, funerals, medical care, divorces, bringing over relatives, etc. One of the few tables in the book reports the annual number of loans and dollars loaned by the New York Hebrew Free Loan Society from 1892 to 1940. The average loan in 1892 was $5, with the peak average loan of $118 in 1929 (just prior to the deflation in the 1930s), declining almost annually to $67 in 1940. The total value of loans reached $1 million in 1920 and stayed at about that amount for the rest of the period. The average size of the loans was greater outside of New York City. Since the associations provided loans, a mechanism was needed to assure repayment. Defaults were kept low (about 1 to 2 percent) by generally requiring three qualified individuals to guarantee repayment. Tenenbaum reports that the most frequent reason for denying a loan was the lack of creditworthiness of endorsers. The Hebrew Free Loan Associations developed in an environment in which Jewish immigrants had few material assets but had a periodic high demand for small amounts of capital (liquidity) to start a business or tide one over rough times and to finance episodic personal expenditures. More conventional sources of capital were either very expensive (e.g., loan sharks, pawnbrokers) or not available for such purposes (e.g., commercial banks and investment bankers). These loans enabled many small Jewish entrepreneurs, whose main assets were their skills, hard work, and ambition, to get started and to withstand the vagaries of business. In exploring the issue of loans, the book includes many fascinating topics, including a discussion of Jewish chicken farmers in Petaluma, California. There are extensive discussions of competing credit institutions created or heavily influenced by Jews that evolved at the same time to provide small business or consumer loans, including remedial loan societies, aktsiyes, and, yes, agricultural credit cooperatives for the small Jewish experiment in farming. There is a particularly interesting discussion of the development in the United States of credit unions by Edward Filene, the German-Jewish department store magnate and social reformer, and the spread of credit unions in the Jewish community prior to World War II. The Jewish loan associations faded with the change in the business environment. Relying primarily on philanthropic sources for capital, they faced capital constraints as Jewish businesses expanded and required larger loans than they could provide. Moreover, other credit institutions, such as saving banks, credit unions, and federally supported mortgage funds,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 449 developed to provide low-cost consumer loans, and banks created small-loan departments for business and personal purposes. There is a richness of touching personal detail in the Association's administrative records-letters, minutes of meetings, and especially the application forms and repayment histories. The stories Tenenbaum relates are tender, bittersweet, and tantalizing. For example, we are told (p. 51) that the widow Mary Ackerman (a pseudonym), with two children, borrowed $170 in two loans in 1939 to start a dressmaking business. Who were those willing to endorse her loan? Were they friends or relatives? What were their occupations? Endorsers played a key role in the process, yet the study is silent on who they were and why they took the risk. How successful were Mary Ackerman's dressmaking business and the other business ventures? Tenenbaum indicates instances in which successive loans suggest that some businesses continued and others failed. Yet, inevitably because of the nature of the data, there is no follow-up. Barry R.
