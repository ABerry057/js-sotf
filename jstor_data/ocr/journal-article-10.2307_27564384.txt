Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell, 2006. xvi, 240 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001414 The study of Orthodoxy is proceeding on many fronts, with Miri Freud Kandel's book the latest addition to this relatively new area of Jewish studies. This book is also the first full-length study of Orthodoxy in Britain, and the changes that occurred there in the last century are as striking as anywhere else. At the end of the nineteenth century, Britain was a country in which "offi cial" Jewry was Orthodox, although most of the laity who belonged to Orthodox synagogues were not particularly observant. It was also a place where there were virtually no rabbis, as Jews' College trained ministers, also known as reverends. The vision of the chief rabbi was that aside from himself and a few dayanim, the country would make do with the reverends, who knew how to preach and perform weddings and funerals but were not queried in halakhic matters. Because of their relative ignorance in matters of Jewish learning, they would 450</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews not challenge the official institutions, and this would make for a peaceful Jewish community, or at least so was the theory. It was this sort of Judaism that began to unravel in the twentieth century. This was attributable to the great immigration of Eastern European Jews, for whom the official, stuffy Judaism of the cathedral-like synagogues had no resem blance to the warm Judaism they knew, and the reverends were as far from a tra ditional, talmudically learned rabbi as could be imagined. In the post-World War II years, an increasingly dogmatic and halakhically punctilious Orthodoxy emerged throughout the world, Britain included. The power of this new Orthodoxy was seen most vividly in the last fifty years. During this period, the chief rabbis were very careful in their statements, to avoid creating conflict with the right wing, something Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz had been unconcerned with. This is the story Freud-Kandel tells, and it is an interesting read, to be sure. Yet I found myself wishing for more. For example, there is a good deal in the book about Chief Rabbi Hertz and his ideology, but so much of Hertz's writings, both published and unpublished (including his doctoral dissertation), remain to be mined before one can offer any definitive conclusions about Hertz's significance. Such a study would have to include his activities in the United States and especially South Africa, where he served as a rabbi for many years and presumably a good deal of relevant archival material still exists. There are also a number of other rabbis who are important to this story, many of whose writings are in Hebrew, yet they have been ignored in Freud-Kandel's study. Where Freud-Kandel is strongest is in calling attention to the fundamentally different attitudes toward Judaism between Chief Rabbi Hertz, enlightened though he was, and the lay leadership, led by Sir Robert Waley Cohen. Regarding the latter's type of Judaism, Freud-Kandel has coined the expression "spiritist Ortho doxy." It is a good way of describing the nominal Orthodoxy of much of Britain, for it refers to those with a lax attitude toward observance but who nevertheless stress what they regard as the spirit of the law. That is, the "values" of the Sabbath and the kosher laws are to be stressed, not the technical details, which are considered hard to fulfill and not really speaking to modern people. While from today's perspective it might appear strange that the lay leadership of an Orthodox organization was itself not observant, this is a phenomenon that existed throughout Western Europe and the United States. Freud-Kandel's insights into the psychology of the "spiritist" outlook can certainly be used in studying Orthodoxy in other countries. In her understanding, the victory of what we can call "ritual" Orthodoxy over "spiritist" Orthodoxy is regarded as the outcome of the Jacobs Affair.l For the spiritist Orthodox, the fact that Rabbi Louis Jacobs held untraditional views 1. The term "Jacobs Affair" refers to the controversy surrounding the potential appointment of Rabbi Louis Jacobs as chief rabbi of England. In 1961, Rabbi Louis Jacobs, z'T, was nominated as the principal of Jews' College, a position considered a potential way station for the chief rabbinate of the British Commonwealth. That appointment, however, was blocked by the then-chief rabbi Israel Brodie because of his published views. Brodie then prohibited Louis from returning to his post at the New West End Synagogue in London, upon which a new congregation was established for him. 451</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews about the authorship of the Pentateuch was unimportant compared to his ability to convey the beauty and depth of Judaism. Where I disagree with Freud-Kandel is in her understanding of the affair as showing Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie's weakness in "defending Anglo-Jewish Orthodoxy against a rightwards shift in its theological positions." I think this is overstating matters somewhat. If the Jacobs Affair had focused on a rabbi expressing some unusual religious views or liberal halakhic positions, then one could argue that Brodie had caved in to right-wing pressure. But the issue here cut to the heart of Orthodoxy?namely, was the Torah the unadulterated word of God? To acknowledge that Jacob's position was acceptable would have completely undermined English Orthodoxy. Among the con sequences would have been an internal split with the creation of an alternate chief rabbinate, the resignation of the Beth Din, and the severing of English Orthodoxy from the rest of world Orthodoxy. No Orthodox chief rabbi, no matter how liberal, could have permitted Jacobs to become principal of Jews' College and still keep the institution in the Orthodox fold. That there has been an enormous shift to the right in English Jewry is undeniable, and the current chief rabbi has often been on the receiving end of right-wing verbal assaults. Yet the Jacobs Affair should not be regarded in this light. The Jacobs Affair was significant in that it revealed to many of the spiritist Orthodox (and the population at large) that there are indeed dogmas of Orthodoxy. That so many nominally Orthodox Jews were surprised by the stri dency of the ritual Orthodox on this point says more about spiritist Orthodoxy's Weltanschauung than any supposed right-wing ascension. I should also call attention to Freud-Kandel's assertions that Hirsch 's Torah im derekh 'erez philosophy must be understood as synthesis (116-17) and that any approach to the contrary should be considered religious apologetics. Yet matters are hardly this clear. No less an authority on Hirsch than Mordechai Breuer, in his most recent discussion of the subject, has argued that Hirsch was not advocat ing synthesis but rather that both the Jewish and the secular are to retain their identities and complement each other. I also noticed a few careless errors in the book, one of which unfortunately appears in the very first sentence, which states that in 2006, it had been "40 years" since Hertz's death (it was actually sixty years). On page 83, she states that Rabbi Joseph Dunner was born in 1906, but the correct year is 1913. On page 185, note 5, she states that Isaac Levy entered the rabbinate in 1936, an obvious typo, as he was only thirteen years old at the time. These criticisms aside, Freud-Kandel has authored a valuable book that breaks new ground in the study of English Jewry. Marc B.
