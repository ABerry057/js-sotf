Six days each week, according to the legend, the river runs so powerfully that neither these tribes nor their seekers can cross it; on the Sabbath, either natural wonders or halakhic restrictions prevent them from doing so as well.2 Thus, whether showcasing the A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the 42nd Annual Conference of the Association of Jewish Studies in Boston (December 2010). I would like to thank Zvi Ben-Dor Benite, Moti Benmelech, Martin Jacobs, and Micha Perry for stimulating discussion on this topic and the anonymous AJS Review readers for helpful comments. 1. Adolf Neubauer, "Where Are the Ten Tribes? I. Bible, Talmud, and Midrashic Literature," Jewish Jewish Quarterly Review 1 (1888): 20. 2. Though the rivers impassability is a standard feature of the Sambatyon legend, as this study will make clear it was by no means an initial component of the legend. While a number of Amoraic sources (Y. Sanhedrin 10:5; Tanhuma, Addition to par. Shelah, 6 [ed. Buber]; and Midrash Eikha Rabba, par. 2:4, to Lamentations 2:5 [ed. Buber, 112]) refer to those located past the river as prisoners, perhaps thereby implying that it cannot be crossed, this point is first explicitly made in later (how much is hard to say) sources such as the tradition preserved in the eleventh-century Midrash bereshit rabbati, ed. Hanoch Albeck (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1940; reprinted 1967), 124, 11. 15-16, where God stretches forth the Sambatyon stream before the sons of Moses, closing them up behind it, "in order that no one will be able to pass over to them" ("כדי שלא יוכל אדם לעבור אליהם"). This source in all likelihood preserves substantially older material. This specific aspect of the legend is also prominent in the Eldad the Danite literature. In one version we read that because of the cloud that settles upon the river on Shabbat "it is impossible for anyone to approach it until after the Sabbath" and that "we are not able to come to [those past the river], and they are not able to come out from there." A. M Haberman, KitveKitve R. Avraham Epstein, vol. 1 (Jerusalem: Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1949), Story 1, 39. In a second version we learn only that owing to the fire that erupts along the river on Shabbat, one cannot come (lit. touch לנגע) within a mile of it (Ibid., Story 2, 55). The exact relationship between the Eldad the Danite literature and Midrash bereshit rabbati remains vexed. Hananel Mack has recenly argued that 1</page><page sequence="2">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin sheer power and solemnity of the seventh day or the piety of the isolated (or general) community, the Sambatyon legend certifies that only in the messianic age will this lost population be restored to the rest of the Jewish people. A great many versions of this legend have come down to us in rabbinic and other sources, often varying significantly as to the river's nature and behavior, as well as to the identity and precise location of the population trapped and/or pro tected by its banks.3 In some cases, the river flows six days each week with water; in others, with sand and stones (in addition or instead).4 In many accounts, the river rests entirely on the Sabbath,5 whereas in other cases its banks erupt in fire on this day or are obscured by clouds.6 Sometimes all ten of the so-called the latter source copied in this regard from the former literature while Micha Perry has argued the account in Midrash bereshit rabbati "represents the kind of sources Eldad (or someone in his name) used to create his description" of the lost tribes and their Sambatyon environment. See Hananel Mack, Mi-sodo shel Mosheh ha-Darshan (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 2010), 190-194, esp. 191 and Micha Perry, Mesirat ve-shinui: masoretyed'a be-kerevyehude ma 'arav 'eropah bi-yeme ha-benavim (Bnei Brak: Ha-Kibbutz ha-Meuhad, 2011), 71-72. These sources can all be found together in Hebrew in Kitve R. Avraham Epstein 1, 1-211. A helpful collection of the various sources in English translation is presented in John C. Reeves, Trajectories in Near Eastern Apocalyptic: A Postrabbinic Jewish Apoc alypsealypse Reader (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2005), 208-224. Explicit reference to the halakhic prohibition of crossing the still river on the Sabbath appears to be an even much later devel opment, appearing for the first time, to the best of my knowledge, only in the fifteenth century. I hope to deal with the development of these aspects of the myth in detail in a subsequent study. 3. Even the name of the river varies in the sources: Sabbatikon, Sabbatyon, Sabbatinus, Sabba tino, Sanbatyon, and Sambatyon are all attested. For convenience, when referring in general here to the river I use the most common and best-known variant. The replacement of-bb with -mb (as in Sabbat yon and Sambatyon) is a documented linguistic phenomenon in Indo-European and Semitic languages. See Victor A. Tcherikover, Alexander Fuchs, and Menahem Stern, eds. Corpus Papyrorum Judai carum,carum, vol. 3 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1964), sec. XIII, 44. 4. For example, Midrash Aggada Shemot,por. Vayakhel, to Exodus 35:1 (ed. S. Buber, p. 187), where the river draws along stones ("מושך אבנים"), but is not clearly stated to lack water. Tanhuma, Ki-Tissa,Ki-Tissa, par. 33, to Exodus 34:27 (ed. Zondel, 126) speaks of rocks and sand ("מושך אבנים ו/בחול"), but again does not explicitly deny that it contains water. For that, one apparently needs to wait until the emergence of the Eldad the Danite tradition, where we read of a river which "six days of the week rolls around stone and sand without a single drop of water, and on Shabbat rests" ("והנהר גולל כל ששה ימי השבוע אבנים וחול בלי שום טיפת מים, ובשבת נח") (Kitve R. Avraham Epstein 1, 29; see also Judah David Eisenstein; Elkan Nathan Adler, Jewish Travellers in the Middle Ages (New York: Dover, 1987), 14). David Kaufmann surmised that the Sabbatical river began its course as a river of sand, later understood to flow on weekdays, thanks to the dual meaning of the Hebrew חול (hot), which can refer to either secular, profane time (as opposed to holy) or sand. But since it is clear that the earliest sources on the Sambatyon presume a waterway, Kaufmann's reconstruction cannot be correct. David Kaufmann, "Le Sambatyon," Revue des Etudes Juives 22 (1891): 285-7. 5. For example, Tanhuma, Ki-Tissa, par. 33 "and on Shabbat rests" ("ובשבת נוח"); Midrash Aggada Shemot, par. Vayakhel. Later, the tradition of the resting Sambatyon comes to be supplemented by that of the Sabbatical fish, which rests on the shore all Sabbath long, and by that of the mountain, out of which silver can be mined every day except for on Shabbat. See R. Eleazar of Worms, Perushe siddursiddur ha-tefilah la-rokeah, "Seder Kiddush Leil Shabbat," 487 n. 119 and Sode raza as cited in SeferyalkutSeferyalkutSeferyalkut Reubeni (Amsterdam: Immanuel ben ha-Yashish Yosef Attias, 1700), lib. 6. See footnote 2 above. 2</page><page sequence="3">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon "lost tribes" are placed across this river;7 on other occasions, only some of the tribes are to be found there (e.g. Naphtali, Gad, and Asher; at times Dan as well),8 or even a separate group entirely (the Levite Sons of Moses and/or Rechabites).9 Finally, while usually marking the border past which the tribes reside, the river sometimes denotes merely the region in which the tribes are to be found, or on occasion even encircles them.10 For one widely attested tradition, the Sambatyon demarcates the refuge of only one (or in some cases two) of the three exiles of Israel.11 A perhaps equally vast body of scholarly literature has previously explored the various incarnations of this legend, of which Zvi Ben-Dor Benite's comprehen sive Ten Lost Tribes: A World History published in 2009 is the latest installment.12 Surveying its beginnings, or, pun intended, the "source" of the Sambatyon, much of this research has correctly observed that the Roman author and natural philoso pher Pliny the Elder and the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius represent the first known discussions of a Sabbatical river. At the same time, however, this 7. For example, according to Bereshit Rabba the ten tribes wandered into exile on the other side of the river Sambatyon, whereas Judah and Benjamin are scattered throughout all known lands. See Bereshit Rabba, Vayeizei, par. 73:6, to Genesis 30:24 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, 2:850). 8. See the version of the Eldad the Danite tradition discussed by Zvi Ben-Dor Benite, Ten Lost Tribes:Tribes: A World History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 87. 9. For the link between the "Sons of Moses" and the Sambatyon, see the various versions of the Eldad the Danite tale; see also Benite, Ten Lost Tribes, 92. The Rechabites, first introduced in Jeremiah 35:1-19, were a clan committed to abstinence from alcohol, agriculture, and the construction ofperma nent dwellings. A number of Medieval Jewish sources place them past the Sambatyon. See Reeves, 20 45, for brief discussion and bibliography as well as Ronit Nikolsky, "The 'History of the Rechabites' and the Jeremiah literature," Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha 13, 2 (2002): 185-207 and Ronit Nikolsky, "The Rechabites in Ma 'aseh Alexandros and in the Medieval Ben Sira," Zutot 4 (2004): 35-41. 10.

Finally, less scholarly in nature but useful as a collection of sources is Eliyahu Avihail, Shivte Yisrael: ha-'ovdim veha-nidahim (Jerusalem: Agudat Amishav, 1987). 3</page><page sequence="4">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin scholarship typically regards these authors as little more than ritual stops on the pilgrimage route to the later, more extensive accounts of the Eldad the Danite and Prester John traditions, of medieval Jewish travelers to the East, and of David Reubeni, not to mention a number of non-Jewish sources.13 And this in spite of the critical and oft-noted fact that neither Pliny nor Josephus (nor, prob ably, the oldest rabbinic traditions concerning the Sambatyon) ever associated the river with either the tribes or another "lost" population. Clearly, then, there is a distinct early history to the Sambatyon, one deser ving of close attention in its own right. A careful analysis of the relevant passages in the works of Pliny, Josephus, and the rabbis—as distinct from later traditions— can greatly assist us in answering the following critical questions: in what context and why did the legend of the Sabbatical river arise? What meaning did it convey, what purpose did it serve? Important as they are, these questions have hardly been posed, let alone carefully addressed. While Neubauer was certainly right to warn against "identifying" the Sambatyon, its source and early course nevertheless remain fully (and critically) to be charted. The neglect of this initial history of the Sabbatical river stems in large part from the brevity of the earliest sources and also reflects the paucity of research that has been devoted specifically to the Sambatyon in and of itself. Since most scho lars have simply approached the river as an element of the larger story of the Ten Lost Tribes or Sons of Moses (even when its independent origin has been recog nized—and all the more so when it has not been), there has been little reason to linger upon passages in which these groups were not mentioned. And because the river has been almost exclusively perceived as a Jewish entity, there has been little attempt to interpret the myth in a Roman context. As a result, the his torical development of the Sambatyon legend has largely remained hidden from view. Simply put: the quintessential legend about Jewish time has ironically remained for the most part timeless.14 13. Benite does devote some attention to these sources (Benite, Ten Lost Tribes, 79-80), cor rectly noting that neither associates the river with the lost tribes or places it at the ends of the earth. The research on both the Eldad the Danite and Prester John literature is vast. For studies which treat these characters in tandem see David J. Wasserstein, "Eldad ha-Dani and Prester John" in Prester John,John, The Mongols and the Ten Lost Tribes, eds. Charles Fraser Beckingham and Bernard Hamilton (Aldershot: Variorum, 1996): 213-236 and the more recent article of Micha Perry, "The Imaginary War Between Prester John and Eldad the Danite and Its Real Implications," Viator 41 (2010): 1-23. For various Sambatyon-related travel accounts, including the diary of David Reubeni, see Adler, Jewish Jewish Travellers. Traditions of the Sambatyon are of course hardly limited to Jewish sources. For Samaritan, Christian, and Muslim reports, see the bibliography referred to by Louis Ginzberg, Legends Legends of the Jews (Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 2000), vol. 4, 40-78. Specifically on a possible connection between the Samaritans and the Sambatyon, see M. Griinbaum, "Nachtrage zu den 'Bemer kungen iiber die Samaritaner,'" Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft 23 (1869): 627-630. 14. Benite, Ten Lost Tribes, 80-1 also draws briefly on associations between Saturn and the Sabbath in speculating that elements of the mythology surrounding this god may have influenced the development of the Sambatyon legend. 4</page><page sequence="5">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon However, when its earliest sources are subjected to careful scrutiny— situated in both their immediate textual environments and in the larger context of contemporary Sabbath discourse—it emerges that contrasting Roman and Jewish attitudes towards the seventh day represent the critical backdrop against which the early stages of this legend need to be understood.15 In particular, Pliny s description of the Sabbatical river echoes the Roman ridi cule of the Sabbath widespread at the time, which Josephus with his wished to counter. It is thus quite likely that this legend first arose among Romans, only later to be appropriated and subverted by Jews. In addition, the early signifi cance of the Sabbatical river legend can be better illuminated by reading it against the symbolic role played by rivers in Roman culture, particularly in eel ebrations of conquest and triumph. But whatever the precise context and con ditions of its origin, it seems clear that in the aftermath of the Great Revolt of 66-72 the Sabbatical river functioned as a new, albeit discursive, Roman Jewish battleground. The respective accounts of Pliny and Josephus differ in almost every respect, first and most noticeably in their length and degree of detail. In his encyclopedic Natural Natural History, Pliny merely stated that there was "in Judea a river that runs dry every Sabbath."1 Josephus, by contrast, offered a much more substantial descrip tion of his Sabbatical river in The Jewish War, one directly built into his historical narrative. Recounting Titus's departure from Judea in the aftermath of the Great Revolt, Josephus noted: In the course of his march he saw a river, the nature of which deserves to be recorded in history (iaTop^Bfjvai). It runs between Arcea, located in Agrippa's kingdom and Raphanea, and has an astonishing peculiarity. For, when it flows, it is a copious stream with a current far from sluggish; then all at once its sources fail and for the space of six days it presents the spectacle of a dry bed; again, as though no change had occurred, it pours forth on the seventh day just as before. And it has always been observed to keep strictly to this order; whence they have called it the Sabbatical river, so naming it after the sacred seventh day of the Jews.17 Comparing these two sources, it appears that while Pliny was content to place the Sabbatical river in Judea, without offering further details, Josephus took care to indicate its precise location in Syria to the north: Arcea can probably be located in the mountains to the east of Tripoli, in contemporary Lebanon, whereas 15. My linkage of the Sambatyon myth to Sabbath discourse is briefly and partially anticipated by Giuseppe Veltri ("'The East,"' 261), though I disagree with his reading of Pliny as well as with his apparent assumption that the Ten Lost Tribes and Sambatyon legends are inherently conjoined. 16. Pliny Maior, Historia Naturalis, ed. Karl Friedrich Theodor Mayhoff (Leipzig: Teubner, 1906), 31.18.24 ("in iudaea rivus sabbatis omnibus siccatur"). 17. Josephus, The Jewish War Books V-VII, trans. H. St. J. Thackeray, Loeb Classical Library 210 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997), 7.96-99; 336-7 (also as BJ=Bellum Judai cum). The translation has been modified slightly. 5</page><page sequence="6">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin Raphanea was probably further to the north in today's Syria.18 Pliny's river is left unnamed, and is sabbatical only incidentally (because on the Sabbath it runs dry), whereas Josephus explicitly linked his to "the sacred seventh day of the Jews," declaring that for this reason multiple, but unspecified, others had formally named named it the "Sabbatikon." Explicitly to name the river was to endow it with a special importance; to suggest that it was "others" who had done so was to imply that awareness of this importance was shared and potentially widespread. Likewise, whereas Pliny merely implied that the river's flow was constant, Jose phus emphasized this aspect of its behavior deliberately. Finally and most signifi cantly, of course, Pliny and Josephus described this flow in distinctly opposing terms: Pliny's river runs six days a week, whereas Josephus's Sabbatikon does so only on the Sabbath. That is to say, while Pliny's account of the river's flow accords with that of all later Jewish (and non-Jewish, for that matter) sources, Jose phus's alone is opposed to them. This is puzzling, and cries out for explanation. At first glance, one might be inclined to posit that Pliny and Josephus simply draw upon different sources or traditions. But the fact that no other known source in any way echoes Josephus's claims as to the location and behavior of the river strongly suggests (especially in light of the degree of detail contained in his account) that the Jewish historian deliberately reworked common source material in pursuit of a particular agenda. In particular, the possibility should be considered that Josephus wrote here directly in response to Pliny.19 This possibility becomes all the more likely when it is realized that both accounts stem from Flavian Rome. Pliny returned to Rome with Vespasian's rise to the principate in 69, becoming a key figure in the emperor's inner circle and household;20 he was at least period ically in the city until his death in 79. His Natural History first appeared in 77 18. On Arcea, see ibid., n. c. Earlier in his Jewish War( 7.18; 312-3), Josephus refers to Rapha nea as the initial base of the Twelfth Roman legion. For his part, Pliny refers in the Natural History (5.16.74) to a city named Raphana, a member of the Decapolis league, located to the east of Roman Judea. This appears, however, to be a different place. 19. For a somewhat similar instance of Josephus responding to a pagan historian, see Yuval Shahar, "Josephus's Hidden Dialogue with Strabo," in Josephus Geographicus: The Classical Context Context of Geography in Josephus, ed. Yuval Shahar (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004), 238-256, esp. 25-34. In highlighting a particular, strange-behaving river, both Pliny and Josephus are in a sense responding to the recently deceased Roman philosopher Seneca (died 65) who in his Natural Questions Questions (3.16.1) specifically rejected the value of referring to individual streams: "But why is it that certain springs are full for six hours and for six others dry? It is superfluous to refer to individual rivers, which in certain months are wide and in others narrow, and to seek out an explanation for indi vidual cases, since I can adduce the very same explanation for all of them." ("Sed quare quidam fontes senis horis pleni senisque sicci sunt? Superuacuum est nominare singula flumina, quae certis mensibus magna certis angusta sunt, et occasionem singulis quaerere, cum possim eandem causam omnibus reddere.").

On Pliny's relationship to the imperial family, see the articles by S. Gely, P. Magno, and B. Zucchelli in Atti del Congresso internazionale di studi flaviani (Rieti: Centra di Studi Varroniani Editore, 1983), 313-23, 331-5, 427-432. 6</page><page sequence="7">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon and was dedicated to Vespasian,s son, the future emperor Titus (whose reign began in the year of the natural scientist's death).21 Based in Rome throughout this period, Josephus was of course similarly well-connected to the Flavian dynasty;22 books 1-6 of his Jewish War were likely published under Titus (i.e. sometime between 79 and 81), while Book 7, or at least the section that mentions the Sabbatical river, was probably written during the first part of Domitian's reign that lasted from 81-96.23 While not furnishing airtight proof, the fact that these sources were written (or at least published) in virtually the same place and time points to a possible interaction between them. But whether or not Josephus was aware of or interested in Pliny's specific text, he was likely reacting to its content, which must have been known in Roman cultural circles at the time. Why would Josephus have wished to respond to Pliny or his source? What would have bothered him about a river located in Judea that ran dry on the Sabbath? What explains the degree of detail and overall context of the river in his account? Before attempting to address these critical questions, it will be useful first to consider whence the notion of such a river might have arisen, or at least with what attitudes it appears to have been conjoined. This will prove especially helpful in explicating Josephus's revisions. While the similarity between Pliny's and numerous rabbinic accounts of the river's flow has often been understood to indicate his exposure to, and dependence on, Jewish tradition,24 one should not simply assume a Jewish provenance for the legend. No earlier traces of such a waterway appear to be found in the extensive Jewish literature (e.g. Hellenistic, pseudepigraphic) of this period, and the rabbinic sources with which Pliny's Natural History in part overlaps were only redacted (whether in oral or written form) several centuries later.25 21. Trevor Murphy, Pliny the Elder s Natural History: The Empire in the Encyclopedia (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 114. H. Rackham dates the work on the basis of Pliny's description of Titus in his preface as six times consul ("sexies consul"). Rackham, viii. 22. Shaye J. D. Cohen captures the relationship most succinctly: "If any historian was a Flavian lackey, it was Josephus." Shaye J. D. Cohen, Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Development as as a Historian (Leiden: Brill, 1979), 86. 23. See Cohen, Josephus, 85-7 for an indication of why book 7 has to have been written under Domitian. See below for further discussion as to why this probably took place during the early years of his rule. 24. See Veltri, '"The East,"' 261, where it is argued that rabbinic tradition on the Sambatyon river and Ten Lost Tribes "convinced" Pliny. There is no evidence that Pliny "locates the ten tribes in Judea" (he never mentions them at all!), nor that the Sabbatical river proved for him the Sabbath's status as a natural law. In the same vein, Louis Ginzberg writes that Pliny "agrees with the Rabbis." Ginzberg, Legends, vol. 4, 407. Such statements are not helpful, for they take as a given a course of transmission that can only be determined through careful investigation. 25. The earliest rabbinic sources which refer to the Sambatyon appear to be Midrash Tanhuma (which in its core has been placed as early as 400), Midrash Bereshit Rabba (first half of the fifth century), and the Jerusalem Talmud (likewise generally dated to the first half of the fifth century). On the dating of these works see Gunter Stemberger, Einleitung in Talmud und Midrasch, Eighth Edition (Munich: C.H. Beck, 1992), 173, 275-276, 301. The date of the portion (23,8) of Pesikta Rabbati relevant for the present investigation is uncertain. Rivka Ulmer has dated this work in general to fifth/sixth century Palestine, noting that it contains much older material, but also indicates 7</page><page sequence="8">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin Pliny was thus the first to refer to a Sabbatical river, and the fact that this river did not yet have a name in his text obliges us to wonder if he might lie at or very near the ultimate source of the myth. Pliny was also the only one ever to place it in Judea, and the manner in which he did so is both vague and puzzling:.. in iudaea rivus"rivus" he was content to write, and one wonders not only why no further infor mation was provided, but also why the river was never previously mentioned in Book 5,26 site of an extensive survey of Judaea and surrounding regions. These textual difficulties paradoxically point to an explanation as to how and why the idea of such a river might have arisen in the first place. Pliny's river appears in the end as an entity more conceptual than truly geographical, one intended to exemplify Judea as a whole, including perhaps its inhabitants. In short, while there is no other geographic evidence for a Sabbatical river in Judea, the notion of a river that runs dry on this day suited the Roman discourse on the Sabbath that was widespread in Pliny's, and Josephus,s, time as, figura tively, a day of drought and deprivation. The Jewish Sabbath was, in this period, a frequent target of Roman attack. Already "in the age of Augustus, the poets Horace and Ovid indicate that knowl edge of the Sabbath as a day that placed restrictions on activity. . . was common place."27 And there is no reason to suspect that this awareness declined in the course of the first century, given that the philosopher Seneca (ca. 1 B.C.E.-65 C.E.) is reported to have complained that the Jews wasted away nearly one seventh of their lives in idleness by observing the Sabbath, a sentiment echoed by both Juvenal (late first to early second century C.E.) and Tacitus (ca. 56-ca. 117 C.E.), the latter adding that "in course of time the seductions of idleness made them devote every seventh year to indolence as well."28 According to a widespread Roman view, the Jews even fasted on the seventh day.29 that chapters 21-4, often referred to as Midrash 'aseret ha-dibrot (Midrash on the Ten Commandments), "did not initially belong to Pesiqta Rabbati," rather representing a later insertion. Rivka Ulmer, ed., PesiqtaPesiqta rabbati: a synoptic edition of Pesiqta rabbati based upon all extant manuscripts and the editioeditio princeps, vol. 1 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), xiii, xvii. In a personal communication (April 29,29, 2011), Ulmer indicated that she believes the reference to the Sambatyon in this section was a quota tion from an early, pre-fifth century text from the Land of Israel. If so, this might make the Pesikta Rabbati passage the oldest rabbinic source on the river. 26. See Natural History 5.70-74 for Pliny's description of Judea. 27. Erich S.

The refrain was picked up by Strabo, for whom the decision not to take up arms on the Sabbath allowed Pompey to capture the city." Later, in the first century, Frontinus (c. 40-104) offered the same explanation for the Roman conquest of Jerusalem at the end of the Great Revolt.3' And while Frontinus's claim slightly postdates Pliny's Natural History—the Strategmata in which it appears was written during the reign of Domitian—there is no reason to doubt that such sentiment would have been in the air in the Rome of the 70s. In addition, as Trevor Murphy has stressed, rivers in the Roman geographi cal imagination "were of great religious and symbolic importance," reflecting the character of the territories and peoples they traversed,32 and playing a particularly prominent role throughout the Natural History.33 Placed against this contemporary backdrop, Pliny's river can be seen to encapsulate in its Sabbath drought and Judean location an unusual, negative, and uniquely Jewish practice: a river that runs dry on the Sabbath for a people who, so to speak, do so as well. Consideration of the precise context in the Natural History in which Pliny introduced the Sabba tical river (as one waterway among many) as well as his descriptions of Judean waterways elsewhere in the work confirms this assessment. In the course of a discussion of unusual waterways, Pliny turned to a group of springs known for their prophetic powers, adding that "it is considered an evil presage when persons who wish to see these springs find them dry: a circumstance which happened very recently, for example, to Lartius Licinius, who held the office of legatus after his praetorship; for at the end of seven days after his visit 439-441 and Daniel Stokl Ben-Ezra, "Whose Fast Is It" in The Ways that Never Parted, ed. Adam H. Becker and Annette Yoshiko Reed (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003), 270-1, where additional bibli ography is also presented. While Goldenberg stops short of arguing that the Jews of Rome did in fact fast on Shabbat, Margaret Williams has more recently made precisely this claim. See Margaret Wil liams, "Being a Jew in Rome: Sabbath Fasting as an Expression of Romano-Jewish Identity," in Nego tiatingtiating Diaspora: Jewish Strategies in the Roman Empire, ed. John M. G. Barclay (London: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004), 8-18. While Williams offers strong arguments in favor of this position, I do not think she proves the matter conclusively. A further possibility which she does not seem to consider is that this was the practice of a small group of Jews in the city (and perhaps beyond it as well) which Roman observers polemically applied to the entirety of the Jewish world. But whether real or imagined, this practice does not bear on the larger fact of negative Roman attitudes vis-a-vis the Sabbath. 30. The sources for the claim of the Jewish refusal to fight on the Sabbath are as follows: Agatharchides, as quoted in Josephus, Contra Apionem 1.209-10; Josephus, Antiquitates Judaicae 12.5-6; Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.16.1^1; Strabo, Geographica 16.2.40, where the impression is created that the Temple fell into Roman hands on the Sabbath, described "as a day of fasting, when the Judaeans were abstaining from all work" (Stern, vol. 1, 302; see also his discussion on 307); Fron tinus, Strategemata, 2.1.17; Plutarch, De superstitione 8.169c. 31.31.

There is in Judea a river that runs dry every Sabbath."34 It appears that the story of Licinius, who died seven days after encountering these parched springs, brought to mind, or at least provided an appropriate segue for, the sabbatically-dry river of Judea. (The unmentioned fact that he seems to have died around 7035 may have itself contributed to the recollection of a province that suffered great destruc tion in that same year). And if this is the lead-in to the seven-day river in Judea, the sequel is no better: a chapter concerned with deadly waters. In other words, Pliny's Sabbatical river is not in happy company and marks the transition in his discussion from springs to poisonous waters.36 Comparison with other passages in the Natural History furthermore reveals that this placement of the Sabbatical river can hardly be coincidental. Trevor Murphy has convincingly shown that Pliny's description of the Jordan river and Dead Sea into which it empties functions as a metaphor for the ruin the Jewish revolt brought to Judea: "A river of delightful quality, obedient and conducive to the fruitful development of the larger whole at its beginning, is lost in sterility in the end, just as Jerusalem, once by far the most famous of the cities of the East, is now only a charred pyre."37 In addition, just as the Dead Sea swallowed up ("ebibitur")("ebibitur") the fertility of the Jordan, so the Essene sect, which lived nearby, thrived on the world-weary who joined their society, bereft of all normal human production and reproduction; Pliny commented on how they lived "without women, rejecting carnal lust, without money."38 And while the Essenes in Jose phus are presented (albeit quite positively) as but one of the three philosophical sects among the Jews,39 in Pliny's otherwise people-less account of Judea, they seem to stand in and most negatively at that for the Jews as a whole.40 Placed in dialogue with this earlier description, Pliny's Sabbatical river can be seen to function as its mythological extension, a further description and explanation for the death and sterility that had come to Judea. 34.

Murphy notes elsewhere (Pliny, 142) that Pliny "represents rivers as means of travel, as con nections between places." Here we can perhaps say that the Sabbatical river forms a kind of narrative bridge linking two related, yet somewhat different, topics. 37. Pliny, Natural History, 5.73, Murphy, Pliny, 110.

As part of Vespasian's and Titus's celebration of the defeat of Judea, Josephus reported that a series of moving stages had been created, depicting various scenes from the war zone, including "rivers flowing, not over cultivated land, nor supplying drink to man and beast, but across a country still on every side in flames."41 The very sequence of wondrous objects paraded through the streets of Rome is described by him as "flowing...like a river" (n&lt;; peovxa 7[0t(1|16v)42 It is well-known that the Arch of Titus in Rome displays in its passageway the celebration of the Roman triumph over Judea, recording for posterity how the various Temple vessels and Jewish prisoners were paraded through the streets of the empire's capital. Much less appreciated is the continuation of the display in a decorative frieze on the east side of the arch, featuring on its far left (and therefore seemingly at its conclusion) an image of the god of the Jordan river conveyed on a ferculum (see figures 1-3).43 Gods representing important mountains and rivers of conquered regions were a staple feature of Roman triumphal parades (in the proces sions themselves, the gods were probably played by actors) and served to demon strate the Romanization of the territory and its key landmarks;44 river gods can also be seen on the triumphal arches of the emperors Septimius Severus and Con stantine.45 In a figurative sense, then, not only were the wealth and people of Judea brought to Rome as booty, but Judea itself46 Thus, if, for Pliny, the demise of the life-giving Jordan in the Dead Sea symbolized the fate of Judea and its inhabi tants, the seizure of the god of the Jordan represented in general its new status as the property of the Roman Empire. These symbolic associations also clarify why Pliny's Sabbatical river flows (somewhere) in Judea—for where else could it?—and render it extremely difficult to conceive of this legend emerging in a Jewish context. In such a a cultural environment, what "work" could a legend about a river that runs dry on the Sabbath possibly do for its Jewish creator or audience? Given the significance of rivers for Pliny and the Roman world, we are also now better positioned to appreciate why Josephus, living in Rome in the aftermath of the Great Revolt, might have felt the need to offer an opposing account of the Sabbatical river—just one of several passages in which he attempted to address 41.

Later on, for example, in his Jewish And quities,quities, the Jewish historian addressed the allegation that Jews did not fight on the Sabbath. In particular, the story of the brothers Asineus and Anileus, two Jewish strongmen from the Babylonian city of Nehardea who seized territory in Mesopo tamia with the consent of the Parthian king, afforded him a welcome opportunity to challenge such allegations.47 On one occasion, Asineus and his forces were threatened with a surprise Parthian and Babylonian attack on the Sabbath. Spies of his who had spotted the attackers reported back that "we are caught by their intrigues like brute beasts . . . because we are restrained from [defending our selves] by the prohibition of our law, which obliges us to rest on this day."48 "But Asineus," Josephus wrote, "did not by any means agree . . . but thought it more agreeable to the law to pluck up their spirits in this necessity they were fallen into, and break their law by avenging themselves . . . than by doing nothing to please their enemies in submitting to be slain by them.5'49 The victory that ensued, along with Josephus's generally positive portrayal of Asineus, conveys to the reader that Asineus's view was probably that of Josephus as well. In this most carefully weighed of accounts, Josephus succeeded both in upholding the sanctity of the seventh day—which does, to his understanding, seem to prohibit military activity—as well emphasizing the Jewish willingness to violate this provision when necessary.50 In reworking the notion of the Sabbatical river, Josephus similarly responded to Roman views on the Sabbath, at the same time exploiting and 47.

Later in this same narrative, at AJ 18.354—6, the brother Anileus is shown to have fought on the Sabbath, and at 18.374, Josephus refers to Jews as "men that despise dangers, and [who are] very ready to fight upon any occasion/' 12</page><page sequence="13">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon Figure 2. Decorative Frieze (Detail), God of Jordan River carried on Ferculum. Pfanner, Der Titusbogen, Table 86.4, reprinted with permission. subverting the symbolic meaning of rivers for Romans. Relocating the Sabbatikon in Syria, and indicating its precise location presumably so as to enhance his credi bility,bility, he neutralized its status as a potential marker of an exotic and arbitrary Jewish practice, or as a negative marker of the Jews themselves, instead praising it for being "of such a nature (4&gt;uc1v) as deserves to be recorded in history."51 No longer a mere Judean curiosity, the river became an established and respectable natural phenomenon that certified the Sabbath as a holy day deeply rooted in nature.52 51. Trevor Murphy has noted that in the Natural History rivers are often described as "famous" (Murphy, Pliny, 145), a practice characteristic of other Roman authors. Josephus, it can be said, seems here to be trying his best to achieve similar renown for the Sabbatical river. On rivers in the Natural History History in general, see ibid., 138-148. 52. It is of course striking to encounter Josephus forging geography, in light of his avowed com mitment in the introduction to the Jewish War to historical and geographical truth, especially at 1.22 and 30. This may well be linked to the particular conditions in which Josephus wrote the seventh book of this work (site of the Sabbatical river passage) which, as we have seen, took place somewhat later. On Josephus and truthful reporting, see also Shahar, Josephus Geographicus, 190-3. Veltri briefly suggests that the Sambatyon's behavior roots the Sabbath in nature. See Veltri, '"The East,'" 261. It is also true that some have identified Josephus's Sabbatikon with the Nahr-el-Arus of northern Lebanon. In his Physical Physical Geography of the Holy Land (Boston: Crocker and Brewster, 1865), Edward Robinson notes that the stream in his day typically runs every third day, though with some seasonal variation, this not stopping the local population from describing it as the Nahr Sebty (Seventh-Day River) which, as Muslims, they associate with Friday. See Robinson, Physical Geography, 359-60; Neubauer, "Where Are the Ten Tribes?" 20.1 have not been able to confirm the accuracy of this discussion. It is of course not impossible that Josephus was aware of such an intermittent stream and made use of it in his report. But even if we assume that this is the case, Josephus would still have needed to craft a descrip tion of the river which linked it to the Sabbath (and not to every third day), thus mobilizing it to do ideological work for him. Identification, to the extent that it is at all possible (and one is inclined to agree with Neubauer that it is, in this case, a waste of time), marks merely the beginning of, not a 13</page><page sequence="14">Daniel Stein Kokin Figure 3. Jordan River God (detail); note water on lower right. Pfanner, Der Titusbogen, Table 86.6, reprinted with permission. A similar point was made in the fictional rabbinic dialogue between Rabbi Akiva and the Roman governor of Judea53 Tineius or—as the rabbis cleverly denote him, punning on the Greek, Tyranus (i.e. tyrant)54—Rufus.55 For in substitution for, analysis. Any local tradition of the sort reported by Robinson, to the extent it actually existed or exists, is probably more likely the result of later exposure to Josephus's narrative than a relic of a tradition to which Josephus was himself exposed. In addition, an early edition of Baedeker's Palas tinatina und Syrien refers to the intermittent stream Fuwar ed-Der, adding that "dies ist der Sabbatfluss der Alten, an welchem Titus vorbeizog," followed by reference to Josephus's Jewish War. See K. Baedeker, ed., Palastina und Syrien: Handbuch fur Reisende (Leipzig: Karl Baedekker, 1880), 439. Once again, the identification is problematic for all the above reasons. 53.

For a summary of the evidence to this effect, see Louis 14</page><page sequence="15">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon response to the Roman's query how the Jews could be certain they were celebrat ing the Sabbath on the correct day, Akiva replied (according to most versions) "let the river Sambatyon prove it" ("נהר סמבטיון יוכיח"). As nature's water clock, so to speak, this river could apparently be relied upon as proof. To what degree might this story be specifically linked to the accounts of Pliny and Josephus? Elena Loe wenthal and Zvi Ben-Dor Benite have both drawn attention to how it appears to presume that the Sabbatical river represents a common point of reference for Jews and Romans.56 Indeed, despite substantial variations among the numerous sources that report the Akiva/Tyranus Rufiis encounter,57 this reference to the Sambatyon nearly always comes first or last among a number of other such "proofs."58 Clearly, the Sambatyon represented for the rabbinic tellers and Feldman, "Remember Amalek!" (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 2004), 62-67. On the lit erary character of the Akiva/Rufiis dialogues, see Peter Schafer, "Rabbi Aqiva and Bar Kokhba," in Approaches Approaches to Ancient Judaism vol. 2, ed. William Scott Green (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1980), 120-1, and, more extensively, in "Rabbi Aqiva und Bar Kokhba," in Peter Schafer, Studien zur GeschichteGeschichte und Theologie des rabbinischen Judentums (Leiden: Brill, 1978), 65-121, esp. 95-100. Referring to the Akiva/Tyranus Rufus debates, Schafer notes that "these are without doubt literary topoitopoi with different speakers, whose historical background is to be found in the Gentile/Jewish contro versy" (Schafer, Approaches, 120). I agree as to the literary character of these sources, but wish to emphasize that the rabbinic tradition rather early on fixed and limited polemical discussion about the Sabbath involving the Sambatyon to Akiva and Tyranus Rufus, a "fact" important for the rabbinic development of this myth. 56. Loewenthal, "La storia del fiume Sambation," 657: "In queste testimonianze il Sambation diventa un riferimento fondamentale, quasi owio e comunque a quanto pare piuttosto comune: Rabbi Aqiva sembra dare per scontato che persino un governatore romano sappia come 'funziona' il Samba tion"tion" (Italics mine). Benite, Ten Lost Tribes, 80: "It is significant that the river is mentioned in the context of a fictional dialogue with a Roman governor, which suggests that, at this period, the Sambat yon was not uniquely Jewish but belonged in a cultural realm shared by Jews and Romans." 57. This dialogue is reported in the following texts: Tanhuma, Ki-Tissa, par. 33; Bereshit Rabba, Bereshit,Bereshit,Bereshit, par. 11:5, to Genesis 2:3 (ed.

Tzidkiya ben Avraham ha-Rofe (ca. 1210-ca. 1275) does not refer to the dialogue directly in his Shibbule ha-leket,ha-leket, but does mention manna, ba'ale zikhurim (necromancers), and the Sambatyon as proofs of the Sabbath, as in many versions of it. See Shibbule ha-leket, lnyan Shabbat, sign 126. On the likely tenth-century and Palestinian Midrash ve-hizhir, which extends from Exodus 8:16 through Numbers 5:11, see Stemberger, Einleitung, 307. 58. The two exceptions known to me are the Midrash 'aseret ha-dibrot and She'iltot, where the Sambatyon is placed between the deployment of the case of manna and the raising of dead spirits, perhaps suggesting somewhat lesser importance. Along the same lines, only in the She'iltot does Tyranus Rufiis explicitly reject the rabbinic sage's argument, stating that "with regard to this river I don't believe you, since I do not know where it is located" (אף בנהר הזה איני מאמינך שאיני יודע את..." 15</page><page sequence="16">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin authors of this story a, if not the, critical response to Roman skepticism regarding the Sabbath. But why should this be the case? While these sources furnish no direct proof in this regard, the emphasis on the Sambatyon in this context points again to the likely Roman or Greco-Roman provenance of the legend.59 On such a reading, the rabbinic use of the Sambatyon in defense of the Sabbath in fact represents the Jewish borrowing and subversion of a Roman trope, a rhetorical move parallel to that of Josephus. Further support for this claim can perhaps be derived from the similarly sub versive nature of the proofs offered in defense of the Sabbath alongside the Sam batyon. In several of the sources,60 it is stated or implied that the soul of Tyranus Rufus's dead father cannot be raised on this day,61 leading the living son to fear that his father has in the underworld converted to Judaism. The father instead reveals that all those who do not observe the Sabbath of their own free will when alive are forced to do so when dead: during the week such souls undergo judgment and/or punishment, while only on the Sabbath are they left alone. This is an especially striking form of rabbinic revenge against the Romans, one which appears to address the typical Roman accusations discussed above: far from wasteful or otherwise negative, the Sabbath is revealed to be both pleasurable "מקומו), a direct challenge which Akiva does not parry. (Sefer she'iltot, She 'iltot Bereshit). It is as if this source, one of the latest which features this dialogue (it dates to the first half of the eighth century), has itself come to doubt the value of the Sambaty on argument and certainly to have forgotten (if my claim is correct) its Roman origin. 59. Linguistic analysis also points in this direction, for the name Sambatyon in this period was hardly limited to the mythical river. In a chapter entitled "The Sambathions," the editors of the Corpus PapyrorumPapyrorum Judaicarum note that in Greco-Roman antiquity "persons, buildings, deities, and insti tutions in various countries were called by names derived from the Hebrew word 'Sabbath'." Corpus Corpus Papyrorum Judaicarum, 45; the chapter as a whole runs from 43-87. From the early Roman period, the standard forms for such Sabbatical names—Sambathyon and Sambatyon (or close variants thereof) became a remarkably common name for men and women, Jew and more often non-Jew (in Egypt and elsewhere in the diaspora) alike. Remarkably, the Corpus makes no reference to the Sambat yon river as an application of this form. But based on what it reveals, it should come as no surprise that this is the name that emerged for the Sabbatical river. It seems clear as well that the Palestinian rabbis who spoke and wrote about it (for the preponderance and certainly the earliest sources on the river are Palestinian) deliberately selected a name that would have currency in the non-Jewish world. For we have little trace of Sabbatical names in Palestine proper from antiquity (ibid., 44). Interestingly, the per sonal name Sambatyon declines in third, and disappears in fourth-century Egypt, precisely the period in which traditions about the Sambatyon river first begin to be recorded (ibid., 55). For more on the use of this and very similar-sounding names, see now Tal Ilan, Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002-2008), Part I, 213; Part III, 148-154, 186-8. 60.

Vayakhel, fol. 122r-v. 61. In the pithy account of B. Sanhedrin 65b, the grave of Tyranus Rufus's father is offered as proof, since it does not bellow with smoke on the Sabbath ("קברו של אביו יוכיח, שאין מעלה עשן בשבת"). This tradition is also mentioned in the second and third above-cited passages from Yalkut Shimoni, as well as that from Midrash 'aseret ha-dibrot 23 (in Eisenstein, Ozar midrashim) and the She'iltot (albeit in more expansive form). 16</page><page sequence="17">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon and of immense long-term benefit; no longer a particular Jewish oddity, it is here recast as, in at least some sense, a universal obligation.62 Most importantly, however, this example nicely parallels that of the Sambatyon in implying the Sab bath's accord with the natural (under)world. It is also true that some of the sources further attempt to justify the Sabbath on the basis of the manna's appearance in the desert, that is, on the basis of an argument wholly internal to Judaism. Neverthe less, the dominant strain in these texts appears to be a conscious effort to subvert the Romans and their views.63 Finally, it is striking that just as in Pliny, the Sab batical river is here juxtaposed with the prophetic arts, albeit with one critical difference. Whereas for the former (and presumably, by extension, the Romans in general), the failure of oracular techniques (e.g. the drying out of prophetic waters) was a sign of bad luck, the rabbis emphasize that even the occult rests on the Sabbath. While there is thus an important similarity in the polemical deployment of the Sabbatical river by both Josephus and the rabbis, the specific concerns of each party were nevertheless somewhat different, and can help us to understand why Josephus's response—the inversion of the behavior of the river's flow— was more radical than that of the rabbis. The rabbinic passages are oriented around justifying the Sabbath as a day different from all others ("what is one day from other days?" a skeptical Tyranus Rufus asks Akiva64), a critical aspect of which concerns the very reliability of this differentiation, i.e. how can one be certain that one is marking the Sabbath on the correct day, how can one discern the difference between one day and another? To be sure, this aspect clearly also played a role for Josephus; hence his strong emphasis on the regularity and reliability of the river's flow: "it has always been observed to keep strictly to this order..." Probably even more important for Josephus in this context, however, was the specific quality and dignity of the Sabbath day itself, a concern that reflects the general, i.e. non-Jewish, audience to which this work was at least in part directed. Josephus certainly had a highly positive view of the Sabbath, and else where stressed its status as a day of gladness.65 The notion of a river in or near Judea that dried out every seventh day echoed too closely for him the Roman criti cism of the Jewish Sabbath as a day of sloth, idleness, and fasting. Instead, through 62. One is here reminded of Seneca's statement (preserved, or at least reported, by Augustine) that "the customs of this detestable race (i.e. the Jews) have become so prevalent that they have been adopted in almost all the world. The vanquished have imposed their laws on the conquerors." See Augustine, City of God, trans. Henry Bettenson (London: Penguin Books, 2003) 6.10; 252. Pace Seneca, the rabbis could not impose the Sabbath on the Romans, except perhaps in the afterlife. One wonders if their doing so reflects exposure to Roman anxiety of the sort to which Seneca gives voice. 63. The rabbinic effort to subvert Tyranus Rufus in particular is furthermore reflected in the tra dition (preserved in B. Avodah Zara 20a and B. Nedarim 50b) that his wife eventually converted and married, of all sages, Rabbi Akiva himself. 64. Bereshit Rabba, Bereshit, par. 11:5 ("מה יום מימים"). 65. On Josephus's positive regard for the Sabbath, see Herold Weiss, A Day of Gladness: The Sabbath Sabbath Among Jews and Christians in Antiquity (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2003), 65-85. Josephus speaks in particular of the Sabbath as a day of gladness in BJ 5.228-233 and A/3.151-178 (these passages are briefly discussed by Weiss, 69). 17</page><page sequence="18">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin the depiction of a river that gushed forth every seventh day, Josephus wished to imply a more positive, fulfilling dimension of Shabbat as the start and culmination of each week.66 Indeed, Josephus appears to have structured his account of the river precisely in order to emphasize these characteristics: "For, when it flows, it is a copious (tioauc) stream with a current far from sluggish (0לו a'/oAaioq); then all at once its sources fail and for the space of six days it presents the spectacle of a dry bed; again, as though no change had occurred, it pours forth (eK5i8com) on the seventh day just as before."67 In this passage, Josephus addressed the seventh day twice, beginning and ending with it—fully aware of the need to counter an opposing account. At the very least, he went out of his way to draw attention to the exceptional day of its flow.68 Ironically, then, if Tacitus later condemned the Jews for instituting the oppo site of what everyone else does,69 here the desire to respond to similar such attacks in fact brought Josephus to invert his source—and by no means for the only time in his corpus. Castigated in the books of both Kings and Chronicles70 for doing "what was evil in the sight of the Lord," the late Judean king Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) came in for praise by Josephus for his kindness and justice; the biblically condemned Zedekiah experienced 'a similar rehabilitation in the Jewish Antiqui ties.7]ties.7] If Josephus had no compunction about inverting a biblical account, there is no reason to believe he would have had any such scruples regarding the particu lar characteristics of the Sabbatical river.72 But his inversion here leads of course to the paradoxical situation that in order to defend the Sabbath, Josephus must have felt compelled to present the river seemingly in violation of it, and this coming from an author for whom the prohibition of activity on the Sabbath was of utmost concern.73 On one hand, Josephus can be understood here to anticipate 66. Though I have no doubt that Josephus primarily has his Greco-Roman audience in mind here, Williams's argument as to the practice of fasting on the Sabbath, if correct, raises the possibility that Josephus may to some degree be responding to his fellow Roman Jews. Noting that the early Roman Jewish community was largely composed of prisoners of war, Williams argues that its alledged Sabbath fasting reflected communal mourning over the fall of Jerusalem, said to have occurred on this day (Williams, "Being a Jew," 16). Josephus's description of the Sabbatical river might thus be intended to encourage a less solemn and more celebratory Sabbath observance. 67. Josephus, BJ 7.96-99; 336-7. 68. Josephus emphasizes the significance of the number seven for Jews a bit further on in Book 7, in the course of his depiction of the Menorah. This ritual object had seven branches, he notes, "indi eating the honour paid to that number among the Jews" in BJ 7.149; 350-1. See below, n. 91, for further discussion of the significance of the number seven in this context. 69. ". . . Moses introduced new religious practices, quite opposed to those of all other religions.

This would be especially true if, as I argued above, the legend is in fact of Roman origin. 73. Weiss notes that "For [Josephus] it was of the essence that on the Sabbath no work, not 'even the most innocent of acts' (BJ 2.456) be done"; indeed, he can hardly "refer to the Sabbath without 18</page><page sequence="19">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon his later discussion of Asineus's determination to defend the law by violating it (i.e. fighting on the Sabbath). From this perspective, the challenge posed by the Roman Sabbath rhetoric was sufficiently threatening that it was worth putting the Sabbatikon to work on Shabbat in order to counter it. On the other, it may also be possible to link Josephus's river to what rabbinic sources report concerning the Hasmonean queen Shelamzion Alexandria (76-67 B.C.E.), during whose rule rains fell every Sabbath as opposed to during the week. On this understanding, far from violating the Sabbath by flowing, Josephus's Sabbatikon simply recalls other associations between the Sabbath and fertility-bringing waters.74 As was the case in Pliny, the specific context in The Jewish War in which Josephus deployed the Sabbatikon further emphasizes the river's role in respond ing to contemporary criticism of the Sabbath. According to Josephus, Titus encountered the river as he made his way into Syria following the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem. In particular, Josephus noted that Titus saw the Sab batikon immediately after apprising the reader of the "costly spectacles" he put on "in all the cities of Syria through which he passed, making his Jewish captives serve to display their own destruction."75 Thereafter, immediately following his mentioning [this] requirement. Weiss, A Day, 84—5. For another case of violating the Sabbath in order to defend it, see Shaye J. D. Cohen, "Hellenism in Unexpected Places," in Hellenism in the Land of Israel, eds. John J. Collins and Gregory E. Sterling (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2001), 229. 74. See Sifre Devarim, 'Ekev, pis. 42, to Deuteronomy 11:14 (ed. Finkelstein, 88-9); Sifra, Behukotai,Behukotai, par. 1:1, to Leviticus 26:4 (ed. Weiss, p. 110b); and Vayikra Rabba, Behukotai, par. 35:10,35:10, to Leviticus 26:4 (ed. Margoliot,) all of which regard God's promise of "rain in its season" (Leviticus 26:4) as having been fulfilled in the days of Queen Shelamzion, when rains fell every Friday night (Sifre Devarim 42 reads as follows: "מלילי שבת ללילי שבת כדרך שירדו בימי שלמצו המלכה"; the Sifra has: "...בלילות שבתות מעשה בימי שמעון בן שטח בימי שלומציון גשמים יורדים מלילי שבת ללילי שבת..."; Vayikra Rabba is very similar to the Sifra: "...בלילי שבתות מעשה בימי שמעון בן שטה ובימי שלמצה המלכה שהיו גשמים יורדים בלילי שבתות...")• A similar tradition, reported in B. Ta'anit 22b, refers to rainfall on Tuesday and Friday nights. These sources are discussed and compared in Tal Ilan, Silencing the Queen Queen (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2006), esp. 36-7, 47, 53, 69, 124-5. Ilan translates Sabbath night (ליל שבת) as Saturday night, and hence writes of "rains [which] fell from Saturday night to Saturday night" (37). More likely, either Friday night is intended—and with it the notion that rains fell regularly on Friday nights—or Friday night to Saturday night—in which case, rains fell regularly throughout the duration of the Sabbath. This is implied by the adjacent passage in B. Ta'anit 22b, on how the rain at night did not interfere with the construction of Herod's temple; rain on the Sabbath eve or Sabbath would similarly not interfere with labor. See also B. Pesahim 112b, where these two nights are again grouped together and Adin Steinsaltz's explanation as to why (Adin Steinsaltz, ed., Babylonian Talmud:Talmud: Tractate Pesahim [Jerusalem: The Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications, 1997], 483). In drawing this connection I am not suggesting that Josephus was personally acquainted with these sources, which were set down in writing after his time (though Ilan does argue that this rain tradition is ancient; Ilan, Silencing, 124 et passim). In any case, Josephus, as is well known, despised Queen Shelamzion (Ilan, Silencing, 70). My point is simply that what Josephus's Sabbatical river and the rab binic traditions of the rains have in common is a link between the Sabbath and nourishing waters. In addition, Pirke Avot (M. Avot) 5:6 reports the well which accompanied the Israelites in the desert (later associated with Miriam) as one of ten items created on the first Sabbath eve. 75. Josephus, A/7.96; 336-7. 19</page><page sequence="20">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin account of the Sabbatical river, Josephus described how upon arrival in Antioch, the people of that city repeatedly beseeched Titus to expel its Jews, and were each time rebuffed by the future emperor ("But their own country to which, as Jews, they ought in that case to be banished, has been destroyed, and no other place would now receive them" Josephus had Titus reply).76 Although no causal effect can be directly imputed to the river (Titus is merely described as having seen it), the impression made upon the reader is striking. If prior to the river's appearance in the narrative, Titus actively celebrates the destruction of the Jewish nation, thereafter, he is directly involved in its preservation. Although cred ited with no specific power or influence, the river's role validating the Sabbath provides a fitting backdrop for Titus's confirmation of Jewish rights. In thus choosing—and there are no grounds for deeming this particular detail as anything but Josephus's own conscious decision77—to place the Sabbatical river herein between these two very different kinds of behavior, Josephus seems to have pre sented it as an implicit symbol of Jewish continuity and endurance, as a sign that not only the Sabbath, but the Jews and their religion in general were etched much deeper into nature than the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple might have suggested. But this is only part of the story—and close consideration of both the prior information Josephus conveyed regarding the situation of the Jews in Antioch as well as the precise manner in which he presented Titus's visit to the city only reinforces further the interpretation just advanced. Already well prior to Titus's encounter with the Sabbatikon, Josephus addressed the origins of the Greek-Jewish tensions in Antioch in an account that appears closely modelled after the second-century B.C.E. persecutions of Antiochus IV.78 The Jewish nation, Josephus first reminded his readers, was especially numerous in Antioch, where those who succeeded Antiochus IV 76. Josephus, BJ 7.109; 338-9. On this passage, see Honora Howell Chapman, "Spectacle in Josephus's Jewish War," in Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome, eds. J. C. Edmondson, Steve Mason, and J. B. Rives (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 308-9. 77. Weiss, A Day, 84. Weiss is the only other scholar known to me to have argued that Jose phus's disagreement with Pliny and the rabbis regarding the behavior of the Sabbatical river most likely stemmed from agenda and not from an alternate source. He is also unique, so far as I am aware, in (briefly) investigating the context in which Josephus introduces it—Titus's departure from Judea and passage through Syria. But according to Weiss, for reasons which are neither clearly nor per suasively argued, the presence of the Sabbatical river at this point in the narrative reflects nature's accompaniment of the Syrian cities in celebrating Titus's triumph: "While Syrian cities display expens ive shows in his honor, nature joins with a display of life-giving waters of an eschatological order" (Weiss, A Day, 84). For reasons that shall become apparent, I find this reading untenable. 78. Aryeh Kasher noted that Josephus's "entire description . .. follows the pattern of an ancient tragedy—the persecutions of Antiochus IV Epiphanies." See Aryeh Kasher, The Jews in Hellenistic Egypt Egypt (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1985), 299. More recently, Joseph Sievers has compellingly empha sized the substantially fictional and, indeed, typological character of Josephus's account in Joseph Sievers, "What's in a Name? Antiochus in Josephus' 'Bellum Judaicum,"' Journal of Jewish Studies 56 (2005): 40-46. Sievers's argument offers powerful support for our treatment of Josephus's presen tation of the Sabbatical river, an aspect which Sievers does not address in his discussion. 20</page><page sequence="21">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon Epiphanes "granted them citizen rights on an equality with the Greeks/' This enabled the Jewish population to increase continually in both size and prestige, such that they "[constantly attracted] to their religious ceremonies multitudes of Greeks, [whom] they had in some measure incorporated with themselves."79 Around the time of the outbreak of the Great Revolt, however, Jewish affairs in Antioch took a dramatic turn for the worse. The son of the head of the Jewish com munity in the city, coincidentally also named Antiochus, accused his father and others of conspiring to set the city on fire. This accusation sparked riots that threa tened the Jewish population with destruction. Antiochus, Josephus continued, con verted over to the Greeks and continued to stoke anger against his former co-religionists. After reporting how the Jews were compelled to offer sacrifice in accordance with Greek custom (the majority who refused were massacred), Josephus reported that Antiochus having next procured the aid of troops from the Roman general, domineered with severity over his Jewish fellow-citizens, not permitting them to rest on the the seventh day, but compelling them to do everything exactly as on the other days; and so strictly did he enforce obedience that not only at Antioch was was the weekly day of rest abolished, but the example having been started there there spread for a time to the other cities as well.s0 The status of the Sabbath thus played a central role in the turmoil and violence in Antioch in the period leading up to Titus's post-revolt visit there—the role of Roman soldiers in restricting Sabbath observance especially noteworthy—and in the pages leading up to the introduction of the Sabbatikon.81 This section is in fact carefully arranged so as to maximize the reader's suspense. Concluding his initial account of the events at Antioch with the statement that "The Jews, with these charges hanging over them and still anxiously awaiting the issue, were thus in troubled waters and in grave alarm,"82 Josephus then turned to Ves pasian's arrival in Rome and to rebellion on the German frontier and elsewhere. Only several pages later does he return to the situation in Antioch and to the rep rieve granted by Titus to the city's Jews. Josephus's description of Titus's encoun ter with the Sabbatikon marks the resumption of this stage of the narrative. In light of the clear significance of the events at Antioch, and especially the central role played there by the question of the Sabbath, Josephus's introduction of the Sabbatical river at this stage of his narrative has to be read as both intentional and significant. It has been written that Josephus believed the observance of the Sabbath to be "of the utmost significance for the preservation of the nation."83 79.79. BJ 7.43-5; 318-321. 80. BJ 7.47-53; 320-323. 81 81. Weiss notes Josephus's discussion of the prohibition of the Sabbath at Antioch but does not connect it in any way with the later discussion of the Sabbatical river. See Weiss, A Day, 80-81. 82. BJ 7.62; 324-5. 83. Weiss, A Day, 84. If Margaret Williams is correct in arguing that the Roman Jews of anti quity fasted on the Sabbath out of mourning for the fall of Jerusalem on this day (Williams, "Being a 21</page><page sequence="22">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin Titus's rendezvous with the Sabbatical river represents one of the most significant instances of this view. There is, finally, one further piece to the puzzle of Josephus's deployment of the Sabbatikon: its appropriation of the symbolic meaning of rivers in the Roman world of the sort already encountered in Pliny. Thanks to the placement of the river immediately after the description of Titus's triumphal celebrations with his Jewish captives across Syria, Josephus's narrative nicely parallels the official triumph celebrated in Rome, itself described at length a bit further along in Book 7. In that later scene, Josephus forbore mentioning the likely presence of the "god of the Jordan river" in the triumphal parade as apparently recorded on the Arch of Titus. Might then the Sabbatikon river function in the former episode as a sym bolic parallel—and indeed response and replacement—for the exiled Jordan? Pre sumably it is not by chance that the river appears alongside Titus, the great hero of "Judea capta." Here, though, instead of putting a foreign river on display for others at home, Titus is compelled while abroad himself to observe a river which (by virtue of its singular behavior) eludes his control. To be sure, Josephus seems to have written his account of the Roman victory procession in Book 7 of The Jewish War more than a decade after the events therein described, and thus after the death of Titus in 79.84 This naturally raises the question of the extent to which Josephus would still have been concerned about such matters. In fact, there is very good reason to think that he would have been: the construction of the Arch of Titus in the early 80s would not only have spurred his memory of that earlier celebration, but would also have provided him especially good political reasons for writing about it. For while commemorat ing the divine Titus ("Divo Tito"), the arch appears to have been constructed during the early reign of Titus's younger brother Domitian, as part of the new emperor's attempts to legitimize his rule by linking himself to the Judea campaign of his brother and father (in which he himself had played no role whatsoever).85 This explains the otherwise inexplicable prominence of Domitian on the arch itself—positioned alongside Vespasian and Titus atop the bas relief depiction of the arch through which the temple relics are being led, he alone is depicted riding a horse86—and can therefore account for the similar and equally bizarre Jew," 16-7), then Josephus's narrative could also be seen to encourage a more positive conception of Shabbat as a day which preserves Judaism rather than one which leads to its destruction. 84. The fact that Titus was no longer alive presumably made it easier for Josephus to create the story of his encounter with the Sabbatikon. 85. Michael Pfanner argues that the arch must have been erected after Titus's divination in late 81 or early 82 and shows here how Domitian seems to have made use of it to advance his own stature, probably during the early portion of his reign. He is certainly correct to insist that the arch could only have been completed after this point (Pfanner, Der Titusbogen, 91-2), though it seems perfectly poss ible that the arch was already under construction when Titus died in late 81. 86. Table 56.45 in Pfanner, Der Titusbogen. Pfanner himself offers further indications as to the striking degree of detail lavished upon the miniature group of Vespasian, Titus, and especially Domitian (see ibid., 91). It is so especially strange to find Domitian more decked out than the divine Titus to whom the arch was supposedly erected such that Pfanner speculates that Domitian himself may 22</page><page sequence="23">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon prominence of Domitian in Josephus,s depiction of the triumphal procession: "Behind them drove Vespasian, followed by Titus; while Domitian rode beside them, in magnificent apparel and mounted on a steed that was itself a sight."87 It is almost certain that Josephus modeled his account of the victory parade after that presented on the Arch of Titus; this scenario certainly seems far more likely than the alternative, namely that Josephus in some way anticipated or modeled the depiction on the arch.88 And it is further not unreasonable to suppose that if the arch itself was completed in the early years of Domitian's reign, Josephus's very similar description is probably a product of this period as well. Josephus, ever aware of his dependence upon imperial patronage, seems to have been eager to display his loyalty to the new Domitian order.89 This helps better pinpoint the likely date of composition of this section while at the same time rendering it all the more likely that the Roman "conquest" of the Jordan was on Josephus's mind as he sat down to write about its fellow waterway, the Sabbatikon. Thus, whereas the frieze of the Roman arch depicts the conquest and Roma nization of the Jordan, Josephus summoned forth a very Jewish river that carefully negotiated that conquest. Indeed, on the assumption that the case for the Sabbatical river's Roman origin is persuasive, it can be said here that Josephus "de-Romanized" this river, insofar as it had suited Roman stereotypes about have played a role in this aspect of the arch's artistic program. In this regard, he refers the reader to a passage in Suetonius's "Life of Domitian" in which the emperor is alleged to have "boasted in the Senate that he himself had conferred power on his father and brother, while they had merely returned it to him." Suetonius, vol. 2, trans. J. C. Rolfe, Loeb Classical Library 38 (Cambridge: Harvard Uni versity Press, 1992), 8.13.1; 366-7 (translation modified). ("Principatum vero adeptus neque in senatu iactare dubitavit et patri se et fratri imperium dedisse, illos sibi reddidisse . . . "). It is worth noting in addition that Suetonius explicitly links this declaration to the beginning of Domitian's rule ("When he became emperor . . . "), possibly constituting further evidence that the Arch of Titus was a project of his very early reign, a supposition which Pfanner puts forward as highly reasonable though improvable (ibid., 92: "sehr wahrscheinlich . . . freilich unbeweisbar"). 87. &amp;/7.152 88. The third possibility, that Domitian had actually had such a prominent role in the original procession and that this was recalled independently by both Josephus and the arch seems to be the pos ition of Martin Goodman, "The Fiscus Judaicus and Gentile Attitudes to Judaism in Flavian Rome," in Jonathan Edmondson, Steve Mason, and James Rives, eds., Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 171. While not impossible, this too appears highly unlikely, given that Domitian played no role whatsoever in the fighting in Judea. On this, see also Cohen, Jose phus,phus, 87. Further indication that Josephus is here simply "copying out" what he saw displayed on the arch comes from the observation that only in this one specific passage is Domitian at all mentioned; every other Flavian reference in Josephus's account of the triumph is to Vespasian and Titus alone. Cf. BJ7.119, 121, 124, and 128. 89. Shaye Cohen points out Josephus's flattery of Domitian throughout Book 7, but does not draw specific attention to the similarity of his description here to the images on the arch. Cohen, Jose phus,phus, 87. On page 89, Cohen appeals for further study of the relationship of BJB00k 7 to Books 1-6 and notes that "in particular we should like to know when BJ 7 was written, and why Josephus wrote it." It is hoped that the observations here offer a modest contribution in this direction. 23</page><page sequence="24">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin Jews. Far from ending up in Roman hands, Josephus's Sabbatikon guides, as it were, Titus toward one of the great Jewish diaspora communities of the age, namely Antioch. The river can thus be seen symbolically to represent an alterna tive kind of Jewish identity. With the Jordan captive in "Rome," a national political identity was no longer possible, but Josephus here seems to have held out a degree of hope for the Jewish diaspora, acknowledging the Roman conquest of Judea while simultaneously revealing its limits.90 At the same time, the sabba tical rhythm of Josephus's river looks forward to a day when Jewish fortunes will experience a thorough revival, demonstrating that however bleak the position of the Jews may at any one time seem, the future promises something better.91 Indeed, there is a pronounced sense in which Josephus's recounting of the episode at Antioch itself underscores the cyclical quality of Jewish fortunes. At the very outset of his account of this episode, Josephus noted that although Anti ochus IV Epiphanes had over two-hundred years earlier "sacked Jerusalem and plundered the temple, his successors . . . restored to the Jews of Antioch" their 90. For a discussion which similarly links Josephus's discussion of Antioch to a diaspora ideol ogy, see Shahar, Josephus Geographicus, 262. Shahar notes in particular that reference to the oikou menemene precedes the commencement of the historian's treatment of the Antioch disturbances. Josephus opens by observing that "The Jewish race, densely interspersed among the native populations of the entire oikoumene, is particularly numerous in Syria, where intermingling is due to the proximity of the two countries. But it was at Antioch that they specially congregated ..." (The Jewish War, 319; translation modified). Though located near its border, Antioch is nevertheless the locus (pun intended) classicusclassicus of the diaspora for Josephus. 91. In this regard, it is striking that Josephus later describes Moses as "the best of all the Hebrews," noting that "Abraham was his ancestor of the seventh generation." These comments immedi ately follow his salvific account of the origin of Moses' name: "Mo" from the Egyptian term for water, "Uses" for "such as are saved out of it." See Josephus, AJ 2.9.6. The notion of Moses as seven gener ations after Abraham was widespread in antiquity. See Feldman, Josephus s Interpretation of the Bible, 378, for further examples. On sabbatical notions of Jewish redemption in general, see for example B. Sanhedrin 97a, where there is reference to "the seven-year cycle at the end of which the son of David will come." According to 1 Chronicles 2:15 (though not 1 Samuel 16:1-23 and 17:12-14), David himself was the seventh son of Jesse, a numerical scheme directly followed by Josephus (6.158 165). The Church father Augustine refers to "the end of the seven days of time" in his homily on Cain and Abel. See William W. Hallo, David B. Ruderman, and Michael Stanislawksi, eds., Heritage: Civilization Civilization and the Jews (New York: Praeger, 1984), 79. It is also worth noting that in the book of Ruth, Boaz who married Ruth is seven generations removed from Peretz, the offspring of Judah and Tamar (and Ruth herself is described at 4:15 as equal to seven sons). For another indication in Josephus of an implicit expectation of Jewish revival, this time based on the book of Daniel, see Josephus, AJ 10.209-210. To be sure, the Antiquities were written several decades after The Jewish War, though it has been noted that "the outlook and concerns of BJ 7 seem closer to those of AJ and Vita" (Cohen, Josephus, 89). Might Tacitus thus be parodying Jewish sabbatical messianism when he writes (The Histories 5.3.2) of Moses "[discovering] abundant streams of water. This relieved [the Hebrews], and they then marched six days continuously, and on the seventh day seized a country..."? Finally, the redemptive character of Josephus's Sabbatikon recalls the desert wadis of Psalm 126, whose periodic flow is a metaphor for Jewish redemption: "Turn our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in theNegev" (Psalm 126:4). To be sure, there is nothing sabbatical or sevenfold in this psalm, though it is interesting to note that in Jewish liturgy it prefaces "Grace after Meals" on the Sabbath and Holidays. I am, however, not certain how far back this association can be traced. 24</page><page sequence="25">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon ritual tools, and granted them the status of equal citizenship.92 Likewise, in the present-day, Titus had destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple but then re-affirmed the rights of the Antiochene Jews when they were subjected to persecutions recal ling those of Antiochus IV. The Sabbatical river,s symbolic role having been better illuminated, the meaning of the specific geography Josephus crafted for it can now be addressed. Josephus's statement that the river "runs between Arcea, located in Agrippa's kingdom and Raphanea ..." lends a certain verisimilitude to what otherwise appears to be his blatant invention. All well and good, but why did Josephus opt to place its start in Arcea, stressing in particular that this place is "located in Agrippa's kingdom'5? Josephus here referred to Agrippa II (28-92 C.E.),93 who as the last king of the Herodian line ruled over portions of the Galilee, including Tiberias. A close ally of the Flavians and determined foe of the Great Revolt (Jose phus elsewhere described the king's efforts to prevent it94), Agrippa II can at the same time be seen as the last representative (at least at this time) of quasi-Jewish independence under the Romans. It is thus appropriate that the river, which appears to symbolize the move from Judean independence to diaspora depen dence, should first flow forth from his territory, and in the direction of a region specifically known for its mixed Syrian and Jewish population.95 Pliny's Jordan flows in to Judea, toward the Dead Sea and the deathly Essenes96 who live nearby, whereas Josephus's Sabbatical river leads outwards towards the confirmed status of a large, prosperous, diaspora Jewish community. One is reminded here of Trevor Murphy's claim that, for Pliny, "the movement of a river from spring to sea is a story: it permits the insertion of narrative into geography." Josephus, too, seems interested in using this river to tell, and indeed evoke, a very particular story.97 92. Josephus, 57 7.44; 319-321. 93. Also known as Marcus Julius or Herod Agrippa II. 94. See his long speech to the war-crazed Judeans in BJ 2345 401. 95. BJ 3.51; 7.43. 96. See above, n. 38. 97. Murphy,/,//jy, 142. Comparing Josephus's earlier (BJ3.51-58) and later (here) descriptions of Agrippa's kingdom and noting his failure to mention Arcea in the former, some scholars have sur mised that this city was a late addition to his kingdom. On this possibility, see Cohen, Josephus, 87 n. 9. Whether or not this was the case (and the evidence in fact seems rather weak), it contributes little to our appreciation of Josephus's reference to the Sabbatikon. Literary analysis of the two passages can much better illuminate their significance. In the first, Josephus notes that Agrippa's "country begins at Mount Libanus, and the fountains of Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the lake of Tiberias; and in length is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias." This is structurally quite similar to his later account, which replaces the Jordan and lake of Tiberias with the Sabbatikon, and Arpha and Julius with Arcea and Raphanea. Thus, if in Book 3 Josephus describes Agrippa's territory from the perspec tive of Judea, emphasizing the former as the source of the latter's greatest river, the Jordan—appropri ately concluding that he has, "with all possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie round about it"—in Book 7 his interest is in Agrippa's kingdom as lying on the way to Syria, and the Sabbatikon as symbolizing the move from Judea to the diaspora. The second passage's inversion of the first offers further indication as to the geographically artificial, i.e. imagined, status of the Sambatyon. This is also nicely illustrated by the fact that it runs between what appear to be two cities and not, as 25</page><page sequence="26">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin In this respect, it is also fitting that Josephus juxtaposed the final conclusion of the Antioch episode, in which Titus left "the status of the Jews of Antioch exactly as it was before . . "98 with a report of the future Roman emperor,s return visit to Jerusalem. While there, according to Josephus, Titus contrasted "the sorry scene of desolation ... with the former splendour of the city,5'99 an invi tation for Josephus himself to editorialize upon "the criminal authors of the revolt, who had brought this chastisement upon [Jerusalem]."100 The reader is thus brought to reflect upon the contrast between Antioch and Jerusalem, between a city whose substantial Jewish presence is validated and reconfirmed by Titus and one in which he destroyed it utterly.101 This comparison of the result of Jewish dependence upon Rome with that of outright rebellion against her appears structured to counsel the need for moderation in dealing with the empire in the here and now, while at the same time holding out hope for a redeemed future. The origins of the myth of the Sambatyon river need to be understood against the backdrop of first-century Roman Sabbath discourse and in light of the symbolic meaning of rivers in Roman culture. In all likelihood a Roman inno vation, the Sabbatical river was subsequently appropriated by Jewish authors in order to defend the Sabbath, and Judaism in general, against Roman attack. The polemical significance of the Sambatyon thus comes to light especially starkly in the pairing of the Flavian-era authors Pliny and Josephus, but is readily apparent would be expected for a river (e.g. the Jordan), from spring to sea. This further redounds to the Sabba tikon's political significance of heralding the shift of Jewish fortunes from one civic center to another, i.e. Jerusalem to Antioch. One might in addition wonder if the very names of these cities are intended as symbolic: "Arcea" evokes the Hebrew או־כי ('arkhi), "rule, authority" (deriving ultimately from the Greek apxr|, whereas "Raphanea" rings of the Hebrew רפיון (rifyon): "weakness, powerlessness." It thus appears possible to read the "source" and "mouth," so to speak, of Josephus's Sabbatikon as indicative of its narrative significance. 98. R/7:111. 99. 5/7:112. 100.577:113. 100.577:113. 101. Shahar, Josephus Geographicus, notes that the diaspora takes on a positive moral aspect when Josephus mourns the ruin of Jerusalem. But it is specifically Antioch, as symbolic of the diaspora as a whole, which appears for Josephus to represent the critical counter-narrative to Jerusalem. Why, of all diaspora locales, does Antioch assume this role? Might Josephus find in its very name (so evocative of Antiochus IV) a striking contrast to the Hasmonean story of Jewish independence in Judea? Anti ocl^s special significance for Josephus might explain why alone in the case of this city does he give ample voice to the diaspora Greek-Jewish tension and violence that he elsewhere attempts to downplay. It has been noted, for example, that Josephus does his best "not to spoil the moderate image which he portrayed concerning the tolerant attitude of the Hellenistic cities beyond the borders of Judaea." Aryeh Kasher, Jews and Hellenistic Cities in Eretz-Israel (Tubingen: Mohr, 1990), 286; see also 285. Cer tainly, his de-emphasizing the Greek/Jewish clashes in other diaspora locales during the Great Revolt while highlighting those in Antioch only serves to emphasize the Antioch/Jerusalem contrast all the more. 26</page><page sequence="27">Toward the Source of the Sambatyon as well in the later rabbinic tale of the encounter between Tyranus Rufus and Rabbi Akiva. The foregoing discussion and previous scholarship, however, by no means exhaust the myriad questions posed by the early course of the Sambatyon legend. Indeed, it remains for the most part to be shown how the river acquired the predo minant characteristics for which it later came to be known. As we have seen, the earliest sources discussing the Sambatyon make no reference to the lost tribes or any other "missing" population as located in its vicinity. When and why, then, did the lost tribes first, so to speak, cross the Sambatyon—or better, why did the Sam batyon cross them? When and why did the Sambatyon lose its earlier geographical specificity (Judea, Syria), migrating—albeit vaguely—to the edge of the known world? When and why did it take on miraculous features, especially the fires and fogs that prevented its Sabbath crossing, and when and why were these wonders replaced by emphasis on the halakhic prohibition of crossing the river on the seventh day? And finally, to what degree did the polemic that gave rise to and so strongly characterized the Samabatyon's initial stages retain its presence along its subsequent course? Indeed, the uncovering here of the previously over looked polemical significance of the Sambatyon in Flavian Rome raises the possi bilitybility of similar new readings of other known sources. Only when these and related questions have been answered in detail will we have a thorough understanding of the development and significance of one of Jewish culture's great legends. And only when these questions have been addressed will we be in a position to analyze with greater care and sophistication than hitherto a critical theme that accompanies it along its historical journey: the tension between the Sambatyon's natural and wondrous character. For the very stream which is at times celebrated as a "natural law"102 is elsewhere, as noted, endowed with "miraculous" properties. Why does this oscillation in the rhetoric concerning the river's character occur and what does it reveal as to its changing role in Jewish culture? And what might it teach us about Jewish culture in general, including its position and justification in a mostly non-Jewish world? Can the case of the Sambatyon be compared with that of other Jewish symbols or entities?103 In addition, to what degree is the turn to nature conditioned by the values of the surrounding culture or prompted by the insecurities of exile and diaspora? And what does it mean, in any case, to naturalize a highly particular phenomenon, be it the Sambatyon, the Sabbath, or Judaism itself? In short, the origins and 102. The phrase is Veltri's, '"The East,'" 261. 103. The attempt to root and replace the lost Temple menorah in a cosmic likeness may well represent an important parallel to the case of the Sambatyon. In describing the sixth-century Palestinian synagogue poet Yannai's partially-preserved piyyut for Shabbat beha'alotkha (Numbers 8:14), Steven Fine writes that this "composition argues strenuously that although the menorah itself is lost, God's heavenly menorah—symbol of Divine love for Israel and of Israel herself—is built into the natural realm realm and is brightly ablaze" (italics mine). See Fine, Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 161. Both the Sambatyon and the menorah, then, offer reassurances-natural or miraculous—for Jewish existence in the face of political tragedy. 27</page><page sequence="28">Daniel Daniel Stein Kokin development of the Sambatyon legend raise fundamental questions as to what is at stake in the grounding of Judaism in nature as opposed to miracles.
