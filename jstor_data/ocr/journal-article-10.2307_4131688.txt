<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shirli Gilbert. Music in the Holocaust: Confronting Life in the Nazi Ghettos and Camps. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. 243 pp. Shirli Gilbert's volume Music in the Holocaust: Confronting Life in the Nazi Ghettos and Camps explores the role of musical performance as a survival tool for Jews engulfed by the Holocaust. She draws her data from four settings: the ghettos of Warsaw and Vilna and the concentration camps at Sachsenhausen and Auschwitz. The book, which is based on archival and published music and songs, as well as literature, diaries, memoirs, and scholarly works on the Holocaust, portrays the complex nature of music as an invigorating human experience. Though it focuses on life and music during the Holocaust in the four places mentioned previously, it also discusses music with regard to memory and remembrance after the Holocaust. Apart from offering factual accounts of daily life and survival in these ghettos and camps, Gilbert strives to help the reader gain insight into the inner lives of the inmates through their musical activities. As she says in the introduc- tion, "The scope of musical life under Nazi internment was a remarkable demon- stration of the integral role culture can play in constructing communal meaning and identity, particularly in times of crisis. My book is an attempt not to negate that role, but rather to widen the frame of reference within which it can be under- stood and to explore it in its myriad dimensions through detailed examination of musical life as embedded in a particular social contexts" (17-18). The author analyzes songs that have already been published or collected by other scholars, as well as books, literary works, and other written sources. The way she handles her materials is both sensitive and moving, as well as scholarly and detailed. Gilbert succeeds in reconstructing life in the ghettos and camps she 473</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews examines through music and narratives about music collected from written sources. Because she conducted her research in the twenty-first century, the number of survivors had dwindled and thus, unfortunately, she could not conduct fieldwork among them. Some of the sources that Gilbert uses were only published or became available in the course of the last ten years or so, whereas others have been known since much earlier, such as Schmerke Kaczerginski's Lider fun di Getos un Lagern (Songs of the Ghettos and Concentration Camps, 1948), which includes about 200 songs (and only 100 melodies) out of many more songs, mainly Yiddish, that he collected right after the war. Kaczerginski's book is a remarkable collection of songs from immediately after the war and presents the Yiddish Jewish culture of the ghettos and camps from survivors who had been recently rescued and freed. Gilbert, when quoting this work, mentions both the names of the collector, Kaczerginski, and the editor, H. Leivick (Halpern), and says that both were Holocaust survivors. However, the latter is not a Holocaust survivor. He immigrated to America in 1913 and wrote a well-known book of Yiddish poems under the title In Treblinke bin ikh nit geven (In Treblinka-I Have Not Been), 1940-1945, published in New York in 1945. Most of the songs Gilbert has selected from Warsaw and Vilna were published in Kaczerginski's anthology, but she also provides the English reader with both a transliteration and a translation for each song. The Sachsenhausen songs come from a book by Inge Lammel and Giinter Hofmeyer, published in 1962, and from the Kulisiewicz collection of music and songs held in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum since its acquisition in the 1990s. The Kulisiewicz collection mainly consists of Polish and German songs composed by political prisoners, and Gilbert's book makes them intelligible to the English reader. Having presented the songs and their historical background, Gilbert pro- ceeds to examine the role songs play in commemoration ceremonies and compares the postwar functions of the relevant music to the complex role it played during the Holocaust. She concludes, This book has proposed that we extend our view beyond narratives of opti- mism and reassurance, and probe music for wider the range of human experi- ence that it both expressed and enacted. Songs tackled a wide range of issues relating to camp and ghetto life: shock, massacres witnessed, children left orphaned, religious crises, corruption in the communities, the profound desire to have suffering acknowledged. They also expressed diversity of atti- tudes to the events, from the feisty optimism of the ghetto children to the morbid sarcasm and black humor of Polish camp inmates. (197) The title of the book may seem slightly misleading. The work provides a deep, sensitive, accurate, and interesting interpretation of the music and songs of the ghettos and camps. It is very well written and brings together many aspects of life under the common human behavior of music making and listening. It is a refreshing overview by a western European young scholar of the Holocaust. 474</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews It is intended for everyone, not just for specialists in one aspect or another of this wide field, as it is a book about life.
