<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Marvin Perry and Frederick M. Schweitzer. Anti-Semitism. Myth and Hate from Antiquity to the Present. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2002. x, 309 pp. What seemed just barely possible when Leon Poliakov undertook to write a complete history of anti-Semitism in the mid-i1970s would strike most serious his- torians as the height of folly today. The torrent of specialized studies of the sub- ject in the past quarter-century, covering every period, culture, and continent, may have rendered such a project all but impossible. Even before Poliakov completed his fourth volume, Jacob Katz had wisely decided to confine his classic, From Prej- udice to Destruction (1980), to Europe, 1700-1933. Yet there is a need for gener- al treatments of the topic, if only to keep it from disappearing into the forest of ever-narrowing monographs and to help non-specialists make sense of a problem that shows no sign of going away. Frederick Schweitzer and Marvin Perry make no claims to universalism, al- though their survey of anti-Semitism extends from antiquity to the very recent past. General treatments aimed at the general audience cannot hope to do justice to the intricacies of the history of anti-Semitism; they rise or fall on the strength of their conceptualization, integrating themes, presentation of useful detail, and accessible writing. Measured against these criteria, Schweitzer and Perry are impressively successful. The authors have chosen as their organizing principle to concentrate on the powerful anti-Jewish myths that have governed the relations of Jews and non-Jews. The capacity of myth to unleash mayhem they take as axiomatic, resulting in some unusual emphases. Werner Sombart, Louis Farrakhan, and the Protocols of the El- ders ofZion get as much attention as Heinrich Himmler and a good deal more than Adolf Eichmann, the actual murderers of Jews, not just fashioners of fantasies about them. This is a legitimate interpretive decision, given that the violence un- leashed upon Jews, as opposed to many other ethnic groups, is almost always heav- ily justified on the basis of ideological constructs. Limiting themselves to six chapters and two appendices, the authors have obviously had to make some difficult choices. Jews as deicides, ritual murderers, agents of evil (whether it be Satan, racial defilement, or international conspiracy), and greedy exploiters of gentiles-these historic charges each get their own chap- ter, packed with accurate information, well-chosen and wide-ranging illustrative examples, all based on extensive, up-to-date readings. The remainder of the book deals with post-World War II mythologizing: Holocaust denial, Jews as the force behind black slavery, and Muslim anti-Semitism, which the authors treat as often interrelated, cross-fertilizing phenomena. The subject of Jews and the slave trade is part of a larger discussion of the Nation of Islam (NOI) and its sponsorship of the scurrilous pseudo-history, The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews (1991), written by anonymous mem- bers of the NOI's Historical Research Department. Schweitzer and Perry do a good job marshalling the evidence against the book's specious claims and shabby methodology. They move on to provide a wealth of information concerning move- 185</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ments of black separatism, information that is often diplomatically excluded from the mainstream media (at least the media that I read). With damning thoroughness they detail the lunatic theology of the NOI, buttressed by extensive quotations from Khalid, Jefferies, and Farrakhan; the documentary evidence makes a compelling case for the destructive intentions of these spokesmen, defaming and threatening not just Jews, but homosexuals, the Pope, women, and the totality of South African whites. Leaving no doubt about their personal feelings regarding this and the oth- er sources of anti-Semitic myths they analyze, the authors also try to achieve some balance, in this case, by recognizing the more hopeful developments in the NOI since the death of Elijah Muhammad, especially in its attempts to improve their re- lationship with Jews. Readers will find the appendices useful. The first deals with Muslim Jew- hatred, providing a compact collection of relevant primary and secondary source quotations and a brief guide to the relevant literature on the subject; it ought to en- able the beginner to place current Muslim anti-Semitism in a larger historical per- spective. The second appendix is particularly valuable on a number of grounds. It recounts Schweitzer's role in attempting to bring a halt to the Holocaust denial and neo-Nazi activities of Ernst Ziindel, reproducing extensive excerpts from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal findings. Schweitzer was asked to testify before the Tribunal on the dangers inherent in anti-Semitic hate propaganda; he is thus able to report firsthand on the difficulties involved in making reason prevail in such cases. The affair ended with a moral victory of sorts. Just as in the Irving-Lipstadt case, it was heartening to see that intelligent laymen-not trained historians or ex- perts on the Holocaust-were well able to sift through the lies, obfuscations, and sophomoric debating tricks of Ziindel's friends to arrive at the truth and to con- demn publicly and emphatically their malevolent agenda. On the other hand, Ziin- del left Canada before the Tribunal banned his Internet dissemination of hate pro- paganda, crossing the border into the U.S. where, married to an American, he and his Ziindelsite continue to prosper.
