Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2000. 274 pp. Medieval Ashkenazic culture often appears monochromatic, especially when contrasted with the dizzying array of cultural and intellectual disciplines that were cultivated by the Jews in Spain and Provence. The typical perception of Fran- co-German Jewry is that of a self-contained minority devoting itself to traditional intellectual pursuits (Bible, Talmud, Halakhah etc.), while addressing the exter- nally imposed need to respond to the increasingly aggressive missionary activities of the Catholic Church. Its spiritual life (with the prominent exception of the Ger- man pietists) is typically portrayed as profound but uncomplicated. With the present volume, Ephraim Kanarfogel has made an important con- tribution to our appreciation of Jewish spirituality and intellectual life in Ashke- naz in the Central and High Middle Ages (c. 1100-1300 CE). Based upon an impressive survey and analysis of the relevant literature, primary and secondary, including a large number of hitherto unknown manuscripts, the author demon- strates that the spiritual and intellectual life of broad sections of the rabbinic elite of Ashkenaz in the Central and High Middle Ages was broader and more varied than hitherto suspected. It was especially marked by the cultivation of pietist and ascetic behavior (perishut), as well as the study of mystical texts and the practice of sacred magic. Kanarfogel begins by providing the reader with a background survey of ev- idence for pietism, mystical study, and prayer among eleventh-century scholars, especially in the Rhineland. This discussion is valuable both per se and as an ac- cessible presentation of the spiritual world of pre-Crusade Ashkenazic Jewry. Fol- lowing this, he proceeds to examine and evaluate the spiritual world of the Tosafists in both France and Germany. By carefully examining the writings and traditions associating various scholars with pietism and judiciously testing their reliablilty, Kanarfogel shows that amidst the rationalist, dialectical revolution wrought by R. Tam, many of the latter's students and followers in the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies adopted pietist and/or mystical spiritual postures. He then consistently makes an effort to correlate these reports with parallel behavior among the Ger- man pietists. One highlight of these discussions is his nuanced treatment of the points of similarity and contrast between the worlds of the Tosafists and the pietists. 332</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews This is an important work that will spur much further research and serve as a point of first reference for students of the period. It could hardly be otherwise, considering the fact that the text, and especially the extensive footnotes, address- es a wide range of issues relating to Jewish intellectual history in medieval Fran- co-Germany. Kanarfogel adopts clear positions on hundreds of bibliographical, philological, and historiographical questions, many of which are still considered moot. In the book's introduction and afterword, the author lightly touches upon two lines of inquiry, which, in my opinion, deserve further attention: First, Kanarfogel's findings apply to both the French and the German com- ponents of this community. As noted above, the widespread tendency among his- torians is to attribute any and all pietist and/or mystical activity in Ashkenaz almost solely to the direct or indirect influence of German Pietism, a position to which the author faithfully adheres. Kanarfogel's findings, however, reinforce the likelihood that many of the practices hitherto identified exclusively with German Pietism and its influence were in fact independently derived from the religious and cultural sub- stratum shared by Jews on both banks of the Rhine. Thus, the cultivation of per- ishut among many Ashkenazic (and especially French) Jews may well have developed independently of German Pietism or, at most, been adumbrated there- by. Recognizing this would have freed the author from the need to seek at all times literary or personal connections with Haside Ashkenaz to explain the behavior and the spiritual pursuits of the many figures that he discusses. The second point regards the significance of Ashkenazic pietistic and mys- tical practices within the broader European Christian context. The author, at the start of the book, rejects the possibility of Christian influence upon the phenome- na that he describes. This may very well be the case. However, scholars have long known that many Ashkenazic rabbis were keenly aware of intellectual and spiritual developments in their Christian surroundings. One might then ask what function (if any) pietism and mystical prayer and magic played in Jewish self-definition, as a contra to the ferment that typified Europe (and especially France) during the so- called Twelfth- Century Renaissance. This was an era marked by Cistercian piety and reform, by the rise of medieval individualism, and by extensive mystical ten- sion and creativity. So, although I agree with the author that the things he describes were essentially indigenous in origin, nevertheless, the encounter with the outside world certainly added dimensions and context to the developments described in the book that go far beyond the narrow question of "influence." Be that as it may, the author is to be congratulated for a significant addition to a frequently recalcitrant field. One looks forward with anticipation to his future contributions. Jeffrey R.
