<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susanne Klingenstein. Jews in the American Academy, 1900-1940: The Dynamics of Intellectual Assimilation. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. xxii, 248 pp. Susanne Klingenstein, lecturer in English and American literature at Harvard, states at the outset that this book "is about the integration of Jews into the American academy. More specifically, it is about the gradual acceptance of Jews as professors of English and American literature" (p. xi). The book, she says, traces the process of admission of Jews born around 1880 into the academy. It follows, she writes, "their slow progress via professorships in philology and philosophy to appointments in English literature" (p. xi), and ends with a discussion of Lionel Trilling, who was born in 1905. The author promises a sequel that will examine the full integration of Jews into English departments and the "gradual rediscovery of Jewish intellectuality" by professors born between 1924 and 1940. Jews in the American Academy is a book of sound scholarship, and is written with an easy hand, in a style that is mellow and flowing. Although some of the ground covered by the book already has become familiar through the work of Alexander Bloom, Stephen Steinberg, Lewis S. Feuer, Sidney Hook, Alan M. Wald, and others, it still conveys a sense of freshness and stimulates a lively interest in the subject. The work, however, is not without flaws. If the book was intended to trace the appointment of Jewish scholars in departments of English and American literature, it is odd that the first eighty-two pages (more than a third of the book) should be devoted to Leo Wiener, Harry A. Wolfson, Horace M. Kallen, and Morris Raphael Cohen, whose fields of interest were far removed from English or American literature. If the purpose was to show that Jewish scholars broke into the academy years before departments of English opened their doors, then the author could, in a single chapter, have</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 319 discussed the academic careers of, e.g., Felix Frankfurter, Selig Perlman, Franz Boas, Meyer Schapiro, and Edward Sapir, as well as those of Wiener, Wolfson, Kallen, and Cohen. English departments were probably the last to welcome Jewish scholars. I think that the claim may be made that undue emphasis is given to the breakdown of exclusion by departments of English, with little regard for what happened in departments of history, political science, sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, the physical and biological sciences, law, medicine, engineering, mathematics, etc. The attraction of English literature may perhaps be due to the story of what happened to Trilling at Columbia, where the president, Nicholas Murray Butler, became personally interested in him as the author of a notable book on Matthew Arnold. Trilling, of course, deserves attention, but it hardly can be reasonably asserted that he played the role of a model for other Jewish scholars who qualified for academic positions, any more than did Frankfurter, or Boas, or Harry Levin, or others whom one could mention. Trilling was more prominent than some, but not more than Kallen or Cohen. The author disclaims any purpose to "Judaize" Lionel Trilling. She is aware of the fact that in 1944 he wrote: "I do not think of myself as a 'Jewish writer.' I do not have it in mind to serve by my writing any Jewish purpose. I should resent it if a critic of my work were to discover in it faults or virtues which he called Jewish" (quoted on p. 232, n. 11). She nonetheless does try to attribute to Trilling a "Jewish" mind and "Jewish" orientation. Seeing him "as a descendant of Europe's rationalist Jewish culture," she says, "helps to explain some of his odd preferences: his limited interest in poetry, his refusal 'to define authentic moral experience in terms of a transcendent religious perspective,' his refusal 'to explore deeply the demonic side of the psyche,' his championship of William Dean Howells and George Orwell against the intellectual fashion of the day. These and other positions are hardly surprising in a man of mitnagdic sensibility" (p. 140). Trilling, she says, "introduced the viewpoint of the Jewish rationalist into American literary criticism. Thus he managed to remain a Jew and to become one of the most celebrated figures in the American academy in his day" (p. 141). Moving from the "this-worldliness" character of Judaism, the author finds that "to be Jewish, then, is to be observant: to be conscious at any moment of the world of phenomena and to respond to it with moral imagination" (p. 157). How, she asks, can the novel be identified with Judaism? "A mitnagdic mind [i.e., the mind of Trilling] can come up with</page><page sequence="3">320 BOOK REVIEWS a stunningly simple answer: the novel and Judaism are not only similar but identical in their observance of the ordinary" (p. 156). This, I submit, is to psychologize with a vengeance. Trilling would have, I believe, every right to resent the attribution of his intellectual qualities to his "Jewishness," to his being a mitnagid. Does the interest of, say, Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope in the "ordinary" make them Jewish or their minds mitnagdic? Did their limited interest in poetry make them Jewish or their minds mitnagdic? Trilling's outstanding qualities as a creative writer and literary critic do not gain any extra merits by attributing them to the fact that he was a Jew; and the definition of Judaism or Jewish culture does not gain enhancement by attributing to it qualities discovered in an analysis of the writings of Lionel Trilling. Having said this, I hasten to add that Jews in the American Academy is, despite its flaws, eminently worth reading. The chapters on Kallen, Cohen, Ludwig Lewisohn, Wolfson, and Trilling are especially informative and well written. The author has obviously mastered the sources and has written a scholarly and readable book that can safely be recommended to both the scholar and the general reader. Milton R.
