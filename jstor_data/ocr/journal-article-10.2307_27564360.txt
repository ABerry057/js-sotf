Concluding Observations by Christine Hayes If the scholarly works discussed here are any indication, as I believe they are, the study of the Mishnah is alive and well. Yet a question immediately suggests itself: Do the works under consideration here together constitute a new approach to the Mishnah and thus inaugurate a new era in mishnaic studies? To the extent that these works share some important methodological com monalities, the question may be answered in the affirmative. Three shared features come to mind. First, as others have asserted, each of these scholars studies the Mishnah in its own right, while at the same time avoiding the mistake of isolation ism that characterizes the work of some earlier Mishnah studies.1 For as much as these scholars understand that the Mishnah in some sense stands alone, each values contextual analysis as well as comparative study of parallel traditions as a tool for understanding the Mishnah. Second, in each of these works, the Mishnah is approached synchronically. To varying degrees and in different ways, these scholars have turned from philological-historical study either partially or wholly. They read the Mishnah as a literary text, rhetorical text, or performance, focusing on genre, style, structure, and a wide range of literary features. The turn is not a radical break. Ishay Rosen-Zvi does serious lower critical and higher critical work on Tractate Sotah before engaging in a cultural analysis of his text. Avraham Walfish notes explicitly that he sees his work as complementing, not contradicting, the philological-historical school. The same assertion would apply to Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, while Moshe Simon-Shoshan states that his synchronie analysis is just divorced from and not contingent on the question of whether the Mishnah is made up of different strata and diverse sources. Because the approach of these scholars does not discredit diachronic approaches as a matter of methodological principle and avoids the trap of homogenization, I refer to it as a "thick" synchronie approach. Third, each of these scholars adopts and adapts theoretical constructs and analytical tools from other disciplines and fields of inquiry. Indeed, the array of theories and tools invoked is astonishing. Walfish proposes a literary-interpretive method that analyzes the structural and poetic features of the Mishnah in an attempt to uncover its ethical and theological messages. Rosen-Zvi engages in 1. In this respect, these works are to be distinguished from the documentary approach proposed by Jacob Neusner in the 1980s, which privileged the independence and compositional integrity of rab binic works to the near exclusion of comparative analysis of parallel traditions and subunits. 291</page><page sequence="2">Christine Hayes detailed linguistic and literary analysis of Tractate Sotah and then subjects his textual findings to a Foucauldian discourse analysis. Simon-Shoshan's analysis of mishnaic narrative draws on Russian formalism and on structuralist accounts of narrativity. He argues that varying degrees of narrativity in halakhic material reflect two different philosophical conceptions of the nature of law?one static and universal, the other dynamic and specific?and then applies Bakhtinian the ories of dialogue and heteroglossia to describe this philosophical complexity. Simon-Shoshan also focuses on the poetics of stories in the Mishnah, which, taken as a group, represent a wider discourse of authority.2 Alexander breaks with the highly literary approaches of these works and employs orality theory in order to expose aspects of mishnaic textuality and transmission that have been obscured by the literary bias in scholarship. Instead of a text with fixed verbal content formulated with great precision and transmitted by rote memorization, she describes a highly fluid text whose multiple performances find coherence in structural frameworks and whose transmission depends on the active engagement of the performer. In short, we have four authors and at least six distinctive meth odological approaches. That is quite remarkable. Does this new, thick synchronie and multidisciplinary approach help to resolve some of the long-standing questions in the field of Mishnah studies? The truth is that the scholarly works discussed here, despite some significant points of agreement, come to quite different conclusions on a number of research questions?but in so doing, they nevertheless advance the state of the field considerably. To illustrate this claim, I would like to detail the contributions of these works on three distinct questions central to Mishnah studies. First, to what degree can we speak of an intentional redaction of the Mishnah? Does the Mishnah attest to a strong or weak redactional hand? Is the Mishnah best understood as a loosely organized collection of sources or a heavily manipulated selection and shaping of sources? I turn first to the work of Avraham Walfish, the goal of whose dissertation is quite explicitly a fresh approach to understanding the aims and methods of the Mishnah's redaction. Walfish focuses on hundreds of literary phenomena and pat terns that he believes have been ignored by previous researchers. These features are not random or arbitrary, he argues. They are the intentional product of, and clear evidence for, a strong and artful redacting hand. These literary patterns and techniques impose a high degree of textual unity and coherence on the com posite and heterogeneous character of the Mishnah's source materials?a unity and coherence that can extend over an entire tractate. Rosen-Zvi also finds evi dence of an intentional reworking and reshaping of source materials in M. Sotah. He argues for the careful and conscious editing of not just individual passages but also an entire tractate. Simon-Shoshan identifies himself explicitly as an ally of Walfish, endorsing the latter's view of a strong redactor whose careful choices and editing of source materials was guided by halakhic, literary, 2. To be clear, Simon-Shoshan does not say that the stories are only about authority, just that they are at least about authority. 292</page><page sequence="3">What Is (The) Mishnah? and ideological considerations. Nevertheless, Simon-Shoshan shies away from the idea of a governing redactional method underlying the Mishnah. An entirely different perspective is offered by Alexander, who does not claim to know how our Mishnah came to be what it is. Her focus is on the tannaitic period itself and the orally fluid conception of traditional material at that time. At an early stage in its transmissional history, she argues, the diverse renderings of tradition were seen as equally valid performative versions of a broader legal tradition. Eventually, a single performative version out of these multiple, fluid versions would come to be viewed by a devoted community of learners as the intentional creation of a single author. However, in Alexander's view, the idea of an intentional redaction involving deliberate and exacting literary choices is a fiction. This is not to say that the Mishnah is a chaotic and disorganized text lacking coherence and unity. Alexander argues that overarching structural frame works, abstract conceptualizations, and repeated fixed phrases generated in the performative moment organize the Mishnah's materials. So, we have a fundamental agreement and disagreement on our first question? was the Mishnah subject to intentional redaction? If by intentional redaction we mean to signal the presence of order, structure, coherence, and patterns, then yes, all of these authors agree that the Mishnah displays structuring principles and strong coherence achieved through various literary devices and linguistic patterns, even if they identify these features differently because of different methodological tools. But if by intentional redaction we mean to signal a strong central redactor who is responsible for selecting and imposing coherence on an otherwise random set of very raw material, then no, our authors do not all agree that a single, very inten tional redactor is responsible for these features. On at least one view, these features emerged in performance and characterize each and every performative version of tradition up to and including that which would become our Mishnah. Our second question concerns the purpose of the Mishnah's redaction, or, if we would minimize the role of the redactor, the function of the redacted Mishnah. Is the Mishnah to be understood as a legal code (following J. N. Epstein and E. E. Urbach), a loose anthology of sources (following Chanoch Albeck), or a pedago gical manual (following Abraham Goldberg)? This question is deeply connected with the first question. Those who posit a strong redacting hand adopt a maximalist position and argue that each redactional choice is fraught with purpose. Thus, Walfish understands the multitudinous lit erary devices employed by the redactor?the repetitions, inclusios, enchainments, and so on?as intended not merely to provide coherence and unity but also to highlight critical themes and to convey specific ethical and theological meanings. The presence of these literary devices militates against any attempt to engage with the text as history and undermines the claim that the Mishnah is a law code. More over, these devices are not, in Walfish's view, primarily mnemonotechnical or ped agogical. Thus, while he follows Albeck in asserting that the Mishnah does not establish authoritative halakhah, Walfish tends to narrow the potential purposes of the Mishnah to the conveyance of a specific ethical-theological message revealed by the literary-interpretive method, and he rejects the pedagogical purpose promoted by Goldberg. 293</page><page sequence="4">Christine Hayes Another proponent of the strong redactional hand is Rosen-Zvi, who shares Walfish's sense that the Mishnah's redaction is clearly purposeful. However, the purpose of this redaction is not so much to convey a specific ethical-theological message as to work out matters of significance to the editors. Applying a Foucaul dian analysis of discourse to the tannaitic reshaping of the biblical sotah ritual, Rosen-Zvi concludes that Mishnah Tractate Sotah is a fantasy of complete and total control of the danger that is "woman." He argues that the reshaping and reinvention of temple rituals such as the sotah ritual provided second century Tannaim with a prime opportunity for thinking through all sorts of reli gious and social issues that occasioned anxiety. One wonders, however, whether Rosen-Zvi understands this to be a self-conscious purpose of the tractate's redac tors. Presumably not. Simon-Shoshan takes an agnostic position regarding the redaction and purpose of the Mishnah, asserting that we cannot know whether it was intended as a law code, legal collection, or teaching manual. However, he does allow himself to say what it is not. It is not a homogenized and flattened work. The Mishnah's redactor allowed heterogeneity?particularly in its use of narrative forms, the heterogeneity of which not only reflects but also exceeds that of comparable ancient Near East and Roman legal materials. Simon-Shoshan also maintains that the Mishnah is not simply a set of halakhic sources lacking social and ideological content. Thus, while there is no overarching redactional method, and while we cannot determine the Mishnah's intention, according to Simon-Shoshan, the text nevertheless yields all sorts of social and ideological information. Through close study, we learn something about the rabbis. His examination of narrative texts, for example, uncovers a basic ambivalence over rabbinic authority. By contrast, Alexander argues that the intended function of the Mishnah is pedagogical. However, she breaks with traditional understandings of the pedago gical function of the Mishnah according to which the Mishnah aims to impart halakhic norms, to expose students to foundational legal opinions, to aid them in the absorption and retention of the tradition. In other words, the traditional view of the Mishnah as a pedagogical manual is content oriented?a view that fails in light of the obscurity and difficulty of the Mishnah's formulations. Alex ander's account of the pedagogical function of the Mishnah focuses not on content but on intellectual skills. The Mishnah models modes of analysis for its students. Its analytic exercises teach students to think, to apply the norms of the legal system. Significantly, Alexander's understanding of the function and purpose of the Mishnah is tied to the compositional features that characterize any performa tive version of the tradition and does not therefore depend on the idea of a strong intentional redactor. Moreover, Alexander allows for the possibility of other con current functions. Thus, while the Mishnah is at least pedagogical, it is reasonable to suppose that it also served as an authoritative source of normative law. The great advantage of Alexander's position is that the normative and pedagogical functions proposed for the Mishnah are not viewed as mutually exclu sive. She can hold this view because she maintains that different features of the text perform different functions. Legal norms are conveyed by the substance of 294</page><page sequence="5">What Is (The) Mishnah? the cases, while analytic modes of thought are conveyed by formal, structural, and conceptual features of the text. Extending this idea further, is it not possible to embrace a number of functions and/or purposes keyed to the many literary, linguistic, formal, structural, and rhetorical characteristics of the Mishnah? In short, do any of the proposed functions and intentions necessarily exclude any others? Our third question concerns the nature of the Mishnah's relation to other tan naitic texts and how this relationship should inform our research methods. Several of the scholarly works considered here examine parallel texts and, with some differences in emphasis, understand variants between the Mishnah and its parallels to be an index of how the mishnaic editor(s) reworked an earlier source or sources in intentional and purposeful ways. Thus, comparison with parallels in the Tosefta or midrash halakhah or even talmudic baraitot is seen as supporting the strong claims of intentional and purposeful redaction noted earlier. Recourse to other texts?not always strictly parallel?has other uses as well. One of these I will label the corroborative use of other texts, and one I will label the generative use of other texts. Walfish exemplifies the corroborative use of other texts. He has recourse to other texts as a control for his literary interpretations. Because his interpretations of the literary features of Tractate Ro'sh Hashanah are admittedly subjective, he attempts to attain some measure of objectivity by checking his proposed interpretations against the broader background of rabbinic materials for coherence and correspondence. Thus comparative analysis is import ant to corroborate the results of his literary-interpretative method. By contrast, Rosen-Zvi has recourse to other sources within the Mishnah and beyond in order to generate his interpretation of textual phenomena, not merely to corroborate it. When he observes a thematic, literary, or linguistic feature in the text, he does not propose an interpretation and then seek corrobora tion. On the contrary, in order to ascertain a feature's meaning, he investigates its occurrence in the rest of the Mishnah and tannaitic corpora. What appears to be its standard meaning and use? Does the standard meaning and use apply also in Trac tate Sotah or is the theme or feature deployed differently? So for example, the violent treatment of the sotah, her public debasement and disfigurement when placed against texts expressing the rabbinic ethos of punishment, specifically pun ishment of women, and the sanctity of the body, is seen to be astonishingly and uniquely harsh, violating standard rabbinic norms regarding punishment and incorporating the very acts that are elsewhere considered taboo. As a second example, the concept of "measure for measure" is used differently in M. Sotah. In its other nineteen occurrences, the term is used to draw linguistic connections between a sin and its divine punishment. Only here does it underwrite a mimetic connection between a sin and its rabbinic punishment. The significance and signification of the various thematic, literary, and linguistic features of the text are thus generated through a comparative and contextual approach, not indepen dently hypothesized and then corroborated. For Simon-Shoshan, the comparative project is important for determining narrative point of view. When rabbis tell stories, they often have a vested interest 295</page><page sequence="6">Christine Hayes in the outcome and will recount events in a manner that supports their own view. This may not be apparent, however, until we locate alternative versions of the story?which Simon-Shoshan terms counternarratives. The existence of a conflicting version of events compromises a source's rhetorical claim to accurate and dispassionate presentation of the truth. According to Simon-Shoshan, counter narratives reveal the degree to which the narrative shape of a given tradition is motivated by the hermeneutic or apologetic concerns of the mishnaic editor(s). The relationship between a mishnah and its parallels, or a narrative and its counter narrative, is of rhetorical significance, conditioning the ancient and modern student's perception of the story's authority. Once again, Alexander breaks with the practices of the other three authors. She does so in two ways. First, citing the work of Martin Jaffee on the Mishnah and its parallels, she renounces the attempt to determine chronological priority of parallels. Oral performance generates precisely the kinds of variety exhibited by tannaitic parallels. The question of priority is therefore misguided?because variants emerge naturally from the performance of orally fluid tradition. In a second respect, Alexander breaks with her colleagues. Freed from a preoccupation with fixed literal forms in a tight linear sequence, Alexander is attuned to nonlinear and nonliteral forms of connection among traditions?connections that are entirely overlooked by those focused on parallels at the literal or verbal level. She demon strates that texts that appear radically dissimilar on the surface may in fact be versions of, diverse performances of, a particular tradition, connected through structuring frameworks, shared abstract conceptions and the repetition of fixed phrases. She thus broadens our comparative horizons considerably, bringing a wider range of texts into relationship with one another to serve as resources in the project of interpretation and analysis. The thick synchronie and multidisciplinary approach modeled in diverse ways by these scholars has begun to expose the many and varied factors at work in the Mishnah's discourse. More discoveries lie ahead, and it will be diffi cult to resist the temptation to synthesize the results. For now, however, it is important that we resist. Cultures and their literary productions are fraught and fractured and complex and dialogical. To my mind, "mapping" the results of diverse research projects is more desirable than a synthesis. To map is to detail and emplot the intersecting findings, meanings, and purposes that emerge from diverse research projects: What does a literary-interpretive analysis of a trac tate, what does a rhetorical analysis of narrativity, what does a cultural studies analysis of ritual narratives, what does an orality-based analysis of casuistic for mulations?what do these and other studies and approaches have to say about the purpose and function of mishnaic texts, the cultural tasks they perform, the meanings they convey, the habits of mind they inculcate, the legal philosophy they instantiate, and the authority claims they espouse or inspire? We need to map it all and let chaos reign for a time. The time for synthesis is not now, not when we have just escaped from the pitched battles between one-size-fits-all theories that seek to flatten and homogenize our data. This is a time for digging with our new tools in order to enrich and complicate our data sets as much as possible. 296</page><page sequence="7">What Is (The) Mishnah? We must also resist the well-intentioned but fundamentally misguided insis tence on studies of exhaustive scope. Certainly there are large questions that cannot be answered until an exhaustive account of a subject is given (questions such as, what percentage of the Mishnah reflects Temple traditions?), but there are many other critically important issues that can be elucidated by studies of narrower scope. There is much we have learned from Rosen-Zvi's detailed study of one of the Mishnah's nearly thirty ritual narratives. Alexander has told us something very important and utterly different from standard accounts of the casuistic form while looking at examples from Tractate Shevu'ot only. Excellent studies of a massekhet, a set of parallel traditions, or some other rationally delim ited subset of the Mishnah can yield more nuanced and less homogenized and dogmatic accounts of the nature of our texts. The day may come for a fuller, more systematic account but only by dint of the piecemeal labors of a community of scholars such as the one fortuitously thrown together here. The data sample is a sound idea. We know its limitations, but the collective labor of the scholars whose work has been discussed here has demonstrated its great possibilities.
