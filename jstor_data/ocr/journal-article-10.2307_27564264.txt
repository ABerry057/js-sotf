Niddah: Lorsque les juifs conceptualisent la menstruation. Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2003. 366 pp. Studies of textual traditions about menstruation in Judaism are seldom without an agenda. Perhaps they cannot be. The polemical history of the literature is simply too entrenched by now. This is also the case with Evyatar Marienberg's series of studies, recently published in France, about the place of menstruation in Jewish culture. Don't get me wrong?Marienberg's book is a scholarly work of high quality, serious in its philological work and impressive with regard to the kinds of sources that the author has assembled. With its broad scope, it represents an important addition to the expanding library on Jewish women's history and the history of Jewish sexuality more broadly, as well as the burgeoning literature on the historical, cultural, and theo logical transformations of the conceptual polarity of cleanness and uncleanness (purity and impurity) in Jewish culture.1 Perhaps in light of this burgeoning literature, of which the book under discussion is but one sign, we can begin to envision a cul tural history of the polarity of purity and impurity in Jewish culture, one that takes seriously its centrality to expressions of Jewish religiosity. At the same time, such a project might also discuss the aspects of culture making (e.g., ethnic and gender differentiation, identity formation) that Jewish discussions of purity engender. Mar ienberg's book marks an important reference point for any such project. Serious scholar that he is, Marienberg, who is currently preparing a new critical edition of the post-talmudic text known as the Baraita ' de-niddah, does not delineate any overt agenda. But there is an agenda?or at least bias?however subtle, and such a bias may be detected in the rhetorical presentation of some of the material and perhaps even in the selection of the sources themselves. 1. Most recently, see Christine E. Hayes, Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities: Inter marriage and Conversion from the Bible to the Talmud (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002) and Jonathan Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). 161</page><page sequence="2">Charlotte E. Fonrobert Before I address this issue, let me outline the scope of the book. The majority of the book is devoted to medieval Jewish literature, particularly (Ashkenazi) European medieval literature in its Christian context. However, Mar ienberg cites sources as historically far ranging as the Bible, talmudic texts, and more recent halakhic literature, such as the responsa of Moshe Feinstein. At the same time, he does not restrict himself to "normative" halakhic literature and dis course. Rather, he includes other source material, such as an advertisement by the Israeli National Center of Family Purity in the Israeli daily Yediot 'Aharonot, as well as some statistical research on sexual behaviors in the United States, France, and the Jewish community. His self-described goal is to constmct "little by little, a social and conceptual history of menstmation among Jewish men and women" (18). However, Marienberg's series of studies could be better described as building blocks toward a cultural history of menstmation, as writing a social history of menstmation is next to impossible given the nature of his sources, speculations on what men and women "really" thought and did not withstanding. Although Marienberg often focuses on tracing the origin of an idea, the book does not merely present a history of ideas either?he very much thinks (and sometimes speculates) about how ideas influenced the behavior of people, measured by how widespread texts (and therefore ideas) might have been and how an idea traveled through arenas of discourse. The six chapters of the book select different aspects of the thinking and prac tices associated with menstmation. After a fairly cursory introduction to the laws of niddah, the second chapter analyzes Jewish and Christian ideas about the very existence of menstmation itself. The third chapter, the longest in the book and perhaps its center, fine-tunes this discussion and turns to Jewish and Christian arguments about the reasons for the biblical commandments and prohibitions associated with menstmation. These first three chapters are perhaps less innovative in their conceptual framework and primarily develop issues in the Jewish cultural history of menstmation that have already been tackled by a number of scholars working in different time periods (myself, Judith Baskin, Chava Weissler). None theless, Marienberg does add important material on the medieval period, both on the Christian and the Jewish side of things, especially in the third chapter. In the long third chapter, he works hardest on tackling the relationship between Jews and Christians. In particular, the chapter focuses on the supposed horrible fate of children conceived from sex during a wife's menstmal period, a belief that was shared by both Jewish and Christian medieval writers. Much of the chapter is devoted to exploring who came up with this idea first, Christians (Jerome) or Jews (4 Esdras). One could raise the concern that the mystical litera ture remains somewhat short-changed. The Zohar is discussed in one short para graph, and the Hekhalot literature is referred to only in a footnote. This is tme for the book in general. But it would not be entirely fair to criticize the book on this point, as Marienberg never claims to be comprehensive in his approach. Here, we eagerly await the publication of Sharon Faye Koren's dissertation, "The Woman from Whom God Wanders: The Menstmant in Medieval Jewish History" (Yale University, 2000), to supplement our knowledge of the ways in which menstmation and the mies of niddah served as tools to think with in Jewish 162</page><page sequence="3">Purity Studies in Judaism culture, beyond the instrumental necessity of generating and exploring halakhic practices. In general, Marienberg limits himself to Ashkenazi sources. Nonethe less, it seems that the spread of mystical conceptions of piety?in particular, kab balistic transformations of the concepts of purity and impurity?influenced the later Ashkenazi thinking and superstitions about menstruation. The last three chapters of the book are devoted to more particular issues. The fourth chapter traces the concept of the "son of a Niddah" {ben ha-niddah), a superstition with respect to conception, as insult. This is a particularly interesting chapter in the cultural historiography of Judaism, as Marienberg demonstrates that the phrase could operate as an insult in different contexts: for example, in the med ieval polemics against Christianity, in which Jesus becomes the archetypical ben ha-niddah, among Jews themselves, and again in the contemporary polemics of Orthodox Jews against nonpracticing Jews. The medieval invention of this concept, the author argues, has repercussions for the halakhic discourse since then because it raises concerns about the halakhic status of the offspring. This chapter ends with a brief analysis of Moshe Feinstein's responsa on whether one should worry about marrying a ben/bat ha-niddah if the person in question is a ba'al/at teshuvah (Jewish returnee to halakhic practice). Marienberg certainly addresses an important issue that has been ignored so far in the literature on niddah. Chapter 5 presents an analysis of the sources that advocate the distancing of menstruating women from sacred space, that is, the synagogue and the sacra, such as the Torah Scrolls. Again, this is an issue that has been raised by others (e.g., Shaye Cohen, myself, Daniel Sperber) but here is vastly and importantly sup plemented with the medieval sources. One may repeat the concern raised earlier that a cultural historian should draw more on the Jewish mystical literature, particu larly with regard to the obsession with the dangerous force of the niddah. But that chapter still awaits to be written more comprehensively. The last chapter, finally, is devoted to the idea of the genetic imprint on the fetus of the mother's mental images, an idea that was certainly widespread in late antiquity. Marienberg, again quite creatively, traces the transformation of this idea to the recurrent warning to women as to whom or what they might encounter on their way home from the mikveh. He demonstrates the lasting repercussions of this superstitious concern in the halakhic literature and contemplates its effect on Jewish women's piety. The book concludes with two textual appendices, one a particular manuscript version of the Baraita ' de-niddah and the other an assembly of the most important passages on menstrual impurity from Nachmanides' commentary. Now, let me return to the issue of agenda. This book is not driven by any overt feminist agenda, but neither does Marienberg offer a merely historical study. No study that integrates excursions into contemporary conversations can claim neutrality, nor does he aim to. In fact, at times, he enters an argument with contemporary voices, particularly those who promote the problematic idea that menstrual sex is prone to cause disease and even raise the chance of cancer?by all means, a rather primitive weapon in the struggle to make more Jewish couples adhere to the laws of niddah. Even in his respectful analysis of Feinstein's responsa regarding the category of the ben ha-niddah, one gets the distinct impression that Marienberg wished for Feinstein to eliminate the 163</page><page sequence="4">Charlotte E. Fonrobert category altogether from any serious halakhic discussion rather than merely limit its force. I have to confess my sympathy for some aspects of Marienberg 's project, many of which I had not considered in my thinking about the halakhic discourse about menstmation in rabbinic Judaism. Some of these, such as the ben ha-niddah, and the vimlent threats against menstmal sex by means of intimidating future parents about their children's potential diseases, rose to prominence only during the medieval period. One might, therefore, dismiss them all too easily as products of the superstitious medieval imagination. Here, Marienberg reminds his readers that this cannot easily be done, considering its presence in contemporary religious discussions. That said, I am not sure that Marienberg is entirely even-handed in his approach to the phenomenon as a whole, in particular when it comes to the contem porary Orthodox?or rather, halakhically observant?world. Certainly, there is a fair amount of superstition and outright misogyny to be found in the vast corpus of rabbinic literature. But if one aims to provide a cultural (or social) history of men stmation among Jewish men and women, as Marienberg does, one should perhaps give more credit to the fact that the practice, independent of what Jewish male writers have made of it, may have been meaningful for many Jewish women. In spite of the obvious lack of sources (i.e., women's texts and literature), this does not necessarily mean that one has to engage in such fanciful flights of imagination as espoused by Anita Diamant's 1998 novel The Red Tent. Nonetheless, ethno graphies by scholars such as Rahel Wasserfall could have provided Marienberg with a somewhat more empathetic perspective on the object of discussion in his sources, namely, the (medieval) women themselves.2 Avraham Grossman does this beautifully, although perhaps overly optimistically, in his history of Jewish women in medieval Europe.3 It is, after all, the task of a cultural historian to con sider the multiplicity of meaning making as broadly as possible. In this respect, the book might have benefited from restricting the discussion to the medieval period rather than allowing the analyses to spin out into contemporary discussions. This might have allowed Marienberg to embed some of his textual analyses in a broader context of medieval (Jewish and Christian) discourses about the body and sexuality, such as Caroline Walker Bynum's Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion (1992), a now-classic work whose great advances for women's history and gender studies are hardly con sidered in Marienberg's work. In such a case, he also could have reflected in greater depth about the differences and continuities between the late antique and medieval periods, especially in the Jewish case, as is modeled by Israel Yuval.4 2.

One can only look forward to further building blocks in this project, one of which will be the commentary and text-critical edition of this most problematic text referred to as the Baraita ' de-niddah.
