New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. xi, 200 pp. Ronald Hendel's Remembering Abraham is a synthetic work that draws on diverse methodological approaches to tease out the interplay of past and present in the Bible's depiction of history. The plasticity of collective memory-the idea that a community's memory of the past changes as that community changes-is a key idea for this book, part of which is a study of the Bible's portrait of Abraham as a reflection of Israel's evolving identity. Hendel is no minimalist, however. For him, biblical history is not simply an invented memory without connection to what really happened, but a pastiche of memory and myth-a reflection of genuine historical experience framed within fictionalized representation. Remembering Abraham is something of a pastiche itself-several of its chapters reproduce pre- viously published work-but the juxtaposition of these studies has value in its own right, offering students and general readers an accessible introduction to how a clear-headed and well-informed scholar distinguishes history from myth in the Bible-and why, in the end, the Bible resists such a distinction. Hendel begins by describing how Israelite memory was shaped by the bib- lical author's quest to define Israel's identity. In chapter 1, Hendel approaches ancient Israel as an "imagined community," one that was really Canaanite in origin but forged a distinct identity for itself through rituals and story telling formed in opposition to foreign culture. The Bible's portrait of the patriarchs and the Exodus-whether or not it corresponds to what really happened-were shaped by the need to reinforce this sense of difference. Chapter 2 further refines and complicates our sense of what memory did in ancient Israelite society by focusing on Abraham, whose memory generated the ties that bound the Israelites into a community but also mirrors the fissures and tensions within Israelite identity: tribal rivalries, a conflicted sense of kinship with neighboring peoples, and the tension between different ethical ideals. The Bible's depiction of Abraham thus captures both the cohesiveness and the divisiveness of memory-its power to ground collective identity but also to articulate dissent. If the Bible's account of the past is adapted to the needs of the present, does that not undercut its value as a source for what really happened in history? Hendel's answer in chapter 3 is not completely clear. The real Abraham is beyond verification, and his portrait in Genesis clearly includes anachro- nistic elements, but it also registers selectively transmitted memories that predate Israelite nationhood: the prominence of the god El in pre-Israelite Canaanite religion, for example, or cultural affinities with the region of Syro-Mesopotamia around the city of Haran. None of this proves the existence of Abraham, but accord- ing to Hendel, it does show that the Bible's authors, while reshaping the past, did not invent it from scratch, transmitting long-existing memories rooted in genuine historical experience. Chapters 4 and 5 make similar arguments for the Exodus and the reign of Solomon, not seeking to corroborate biblical history exactly- that would forget the lessons of chapters 1 and 2--but to show that the Bible reg- isters real experience even as it adapts that experience to the interests of later rememberers. 195</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In the final chapter, Hendel tries to go beyond the polarity between fiction and history by exposing the shortcomings of generic labels. He begins with a distinction of his own-the contrast between Greek historiography, in which the key task of the historian is to verify or falsify sources, and biblical histor- iography, which is engaged not by the question of what is true about history but by what history means and how it bears on the present (Paul Veyne's Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths? complicates this understanding of how Greek historians related to truth, but the nature of Greek historiography is an issue for another setting). Biblical authors filled in, revised, and corrected their sources, but it would not have occurred to them to question their basic veracity because for them, those sources had a sacred authority that precluded a skeptical reaction. In fact, history's role in the Bible was equivalent to that of myth in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, which helps to explain why bib- lical narrative sometimes interweaves mythic motifs into its history. Biblical scholars often treat history and myth as mutually exclusive categories, but Hendel argues for their functional equivalence and interpenetration, proposing that the modem generic category that best describes the enterprise of biblical history as its own authors envisioned it is not "history" but "collective memory," a selective, imaginative account of the past whose aim is to distill from it identity and meaning. In his discussion of the Exodus story, Hendel emphasizes the remembered Moses as a mediating figure who is able to bridge the polarities and contradic- tions of Israel's existence and theology. Hendel may be projecting onto Moses his own scholarly impulses, for he himself is a mediating figure in this book, bridging historical, literary, sociological, and archaeological approaches, synthe- sizing the work of older scholars such as Alt and Gunkel with more recent ones such as Sternberg and Finkelstein, and seeking to overcome the apparent con- tradiction between minimalist and maximalist approaches to biblical history. Because there is some merit to all these perspectives, Hendel seems headed in the right direction in his effort to incorporate them into a single reconstruction. And yet, as Hendel also observes, Moses' mediation is often incomplete- he takes Israel most of the way from Egypt to the Promised Land but is unable to complete the journey-and the same may be true of Hendel's mediating efforts. The book takes a step forward by putting different, sometimes polarized approaches in conversation with one another, but what finally is the outcome of this conversation? That the Bible combines myth and history, invented memory and echoes of real historical events? Yes, but that merely restates the consensus view of mainstream biblical scholarship. More intriguing is Hendel's striving to get beyond these polarities-to describe a dialectic between history and myth in which one shapes the other and to rethink the very distinction between these cat- egories, but his moves in this direction are sketchier and less cogent than his efforts to illustrate the coexistence of fictional and factual elements in biblical narrative. Remembering Abraham points those interested in biblical history in a fresh direction-toward a promised land of "mnemohistory" where the contra- dictions of biblical scholarship are absorbed within a new synthesis-but it only 196</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews leads readers a few steps in that direction, leaving them to wonder how to complete the journey.
