Tel-Aviv: Dvir/Makhon Leo Baeck, 1997. x, 225 pp. (Hebrew). "Romance with the Past" is the translation offered on the overleaf of Nitsa Ben-Ari's Roman 'im ha-avar yet the title of her study might also be rendered as "a novel with a past." The word-play nicely captures the subject of Ben-Ari's literary investigation: the historical adventure stories, so popular with the Hebrew-reading public from the 1890s until the mid-twentieth century, that were largely adaptations of nineteenth-century German-language novels aimed at a Jewish readership. Building upon historian Shmuel Feiner's monumental study of the role of popularized historiography in the shaping of a modem Jewish historical consciousness in Eastern Europe, Ben-Ari turns her attention to the paradoxical roots of the new national Hebrew literature in works originally produced by a German-Jewish culture concerned with emancipation, embourgeoisement, and integration rather than national revival. All nationalist movements thrive on the creative construction of usable</page><page sequence="2">146 BOOK REVIEWS pasts, yet from Mapu's pioneering 1853 novel Ahavat Zion to the works of Kabak and Ibn Zahav in the late 1920s, no new original Hebrew historical nov- els were written, and readers hungry for historical heroes satisfied themselves with tales that had first appeared as serials in German-Jewish newspapers like the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums or Der Israelit. Eastern European Maskilim such as Kalman Schulman, S. J. Fiinn, and A. S. Friedberg (Har- Shalom) translated and adapted the works of writer/journalist/rabbis Ludwig Philippson and Marcus Lehmann, who turned out numerous German-language novels for Jewish readers. Ben-Ari's innovative study is a broad survey of this neglected chapter of Jewish literature. Ben-Ari's first chapters situate the German-Jewish historical novel in its social, literary, and historical contexts. She then moves on to four case studies: the Orthodox writer Marcus Lehmann's dramatized biography of Akiba (1881), a novel set in the era of Julian the Apostate by reformer Ludwig Philippson (1866), a five-volume saga of Jewish history from the destruction of the First Temple to the Berlin Haskalah by the Arabist Her- mann Reckendorf (1856-57), and the popular Hebrew-language adaptation of Reckendorf's novel by A. S. Friedberg (1890s). Ben-Ari means to contrast novels from German Jewry's various "ideological camps," with Hermann Reckendorf's novel held up as an example of "extreme Reform ideology." Her attempt to correlate the narrative features of these novels with their political tendencies is interesting, but not always convincing; the passages quoted from Reckendorf's afterword to the reader suggest that his own sympathies lay with the traditionalist camp. In general, Ben-Ari's study is strongest in its analysis of the neo-Orthodox and romantic nationalist novels of Marcus Lehmann and A. S. Friedberg, but she takes a somewhat polemical stance in her portrayal of the German-Jewish liberal tradition. This is made clear by one telling error: Ben-Ari mislabels the writer Berthold Auerbach an apostate (p. 43), whereas he was in fact the most prominent nineteenth-century German-Jewish author who did not convert. Ben-Ari pinpoints what is interesting about these novels for the student of nationalist movements: that the same historical images employed by Jews reinventing themselves for a complex agenda combining integration into European bourgeois culture with the preservation of Jewish identity could later be mobilized in the service of nationalism. Whether one accepts Ben- Ari's thesis that these novels are evidence of subconscious "vague national longings" that contrasted with the declared diasporism of nineteenth-century German Jewry, or instead historicizes these novels as delicate (and deliberate)</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 147 renegotiations of group identity in an age of mutable boundaries, Ben-Ari's work opens new avenues for anyone interested in the intersections of historical thought and popular culture in the nineteenth century.
