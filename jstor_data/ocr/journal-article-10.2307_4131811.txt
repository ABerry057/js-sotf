Although Yemen had, until the 1950s, a sizable Jewish population whose presence dated back centuries before the advent of Islam, various Muslim rulers of key parts of Yemen enforced the sump- tuary laws and other restrictions stipulated in the Pact of cUmar with unusual strin- gency, and the Jews' history under Islamic rule was marred by sporadic instances of outright persecution.' In this context, the Zaydi Shiite imam's expulsion ofYemen's Jews in the late 1670s from the highland region centering on Sanda, where the Jewish population has historically concentrated, to the town of Mawza' in the coastal plain known as the Tihama appears to be an unusually severe instance of persecution, but one that is unquestionably part of an historical pattern peculiar to Yemen. Geography and sectarian doctrine arguably contribute to this pattern. Yemen's isolation relative to the central Islamic lands has historically made it an attractive haven for sectarian offshoots of normative Sunni Islam; S.D. Goitein has asserted that the fortunes of *Note on transliteration: For the sake of accessibility, I have omitted diacritical markings, apart from Cayn and hamza, in transliterations of Arabic and Ottoman Turkish names (with the exception of Ismail, which is commonly spelled without diacriticals in English-language texts).

The Pact of 'Umar--supposedly the peace treaty between the second caliph, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (r. 634-44), and the Christians of Jerusalem but probably dating, at least in part, from a considerably later period-is the template for the treatment of non-Muslim monotheists under Muslim rule before the nineteenth century; essentially, it pledges the ruler's protection in exchange for certain restrictions in public behavior. For the text, see Muhammad ibn al-Walid al-Turtushi (1059/60- 1126/27), Sirdj al-mulik (The Lamp of the Kings) (Cairo: Al-Maktaba al-Mahmiidiyya al-Tij~iyya, 1935), 252-53. 111</page><page sequence="2">Jane Hathaway Jews tended to decline under the rule of sectarian Muslims, by which he means the various Shiite sects.2 Indeed, Maimonides penned his famous Epistle to the Jews of Yemen, which has perhaps done more than any other literary work to seal Yemen's unsavory reputation, in response to the forcible conversion of Jews by an Ismaili Shiite messianic figure who emerged during the chaos following the col- lapse of the Ismaili Sulayhid dynasty in the late twelfth century. 3 To many scholars, the Mawza' exile seems every bit as lachrymose as the persecutions half a millennium earlier that prompted Maimonides to pen his fa- mous epistle. In this instance, Jews were not forcibly converted, but rather were forced from their homes and driven to the southwestern Yemeni town of Mawza', inland from the Red Sea port of Mocha. Evidently, the strategy was to corral them there, then to encourage them to depart on whatever ships happened to be avail- able at Mocha; since Yemen had no ship-building industry of its own, these would probably have been Indian merchant vessels.4 In the event, most of the Jews lin- gered in Mawza', where many died of starvation or disease brought on by over- crowded living conditions and the torrid climate.5 Meanwhile, their absence from Sanda and the inland highland regions devastated the handicraft industries, partic- ularly silver working, in which Jews had concentrated, and disrupted society gen- erally. Finally, after at least a year, they were allowed to return to their homes.6 On the surface, this incident appears to conform to the familiar lachrymose Yemeni pattern, coupled with the pattern articulated by Goitein of Jewish suffer- 2.

For at the time of the expulsion, most of Yemen was un- der the sway of the Zaydi Shiite Qasimi dynasty, which had emerged in 1598. The Jewish context of the expulsion has been articulated in a number of primary and secondary works: notably the chronicle of the Yemeni historian Hayyim Habshush (or Hibshush, d. 1899), excerpted in Hebrew translation by Yehuda Ratzaby;7 in the Hebrew poetry of the Yemeni poet Shalem (or Shalom) ben Yosef Shabazi (1619- 86), published by Ratzaby and Yosef Tobi;8 in various other contemporary Yemeni Jewish sources published by Ratzaby and Tobi;9 and in Ratzaby's seminal article on the subject, which incorporates many contemporary primary sources.10 More recently, P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan, and Q. al-Samarrai have detailed the Zay- di response to the movement.1" Both local Jewish and Zaydi sources demonstrate that the expulsion occurred several years after a wave of messianism inspired, or at least reinforced, by the movement of Sabbatai Sevi swept Yemen's Jewish com- munity, provoking social upheaval.12 Here, however, I wish to place the expulsion order, as well as the Qasimi imamate's response to this wave of messianism, within a broader geopolitical and religious context. It is useful to return to the circumstances of the Epistle to the Jews of Yemen for justification. Acknowledging that both Rabbanite and Karaite Jewish elites enjoyed extraordinary influence under both the Sulayhids and their Fatimid allies in Egypt, Goitein concludes that "it was not the deviation from or- thodox Islam itself or particular racial elements which decided the attitude toward non-Muslims, but the actual tenets and beliefs held by the sect concerned."'3 In 7.

Moreover, the Ottomans themselves at this time were heavily influenced by a wave of zealous Sunni orthodoxy. Like the forced conversions of the late twelfth century that prompted Mai- monides' epistle, the Zaydi imam's expulsion of the Jews, as well as his reaction to the messianic events of 1667, was colored not simply by the peculiarities of Muslim sectarianism but also by the Zaydis' position in the broader geopolitical scene, in particular their ideological and geopolitical competition with the Ot- toman Empire. A contributing factor unique to Yemen, however, was the resonance of the ancient Jewish presence in Yemeni collective memory, as attested by popu- lar oral narratives. Here, then, I will attempt to demonstrate: (1) that the Qasimi imamate was galvanized by a form of messianic zeal centered on emulation of the Prophet Muhammad and that treatment of non-Muslims was a central element of this emulation; (2) that Jewish messianism in Yemen shared key features with Zay- di messianism as propounded by the Qasimis and resonated all the more because of the popular memory of Jewish leadership in Yemen; and (3) that the Qasimi ri- valry with the Ottomans contributed to the Mawza' exile, the more so because the Ottomans were themselves in the throes of a heightened, quasi-messianic religious zeal informed by their own responses to the messianic movement of Sabbatai Sevi. ZAYDI IMAMS AND ZAYDI MESSIANISM The Zaydis are the smallest surviving recognized subsect of Shiite Islam, third in number behind the majority Imamis, also known as Ithna', cAsharis (Twelvers), and the Ismailis (Seveners). Not coincidentally, they are also the most poorly researched of the three major Shiite subsects. They take their name from Zayd ibn 'Ali (d. 740 CE), the Prophet's great-great grandson, whom they initial- ly regarded as fifth in the line of Shiite imams, or successors to the Prophet as lead- Tustari, who served the Fatimids as vizier, and his brother Abu Nasr, a wealthy merchant; see Stillman, Jews ofArab Lands, 52, 204, 207. 14.

Yemen's territory was divided among the rival Zaydi Shiite imams, various Ismaili splinter groups, and a force under the broth- er of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi (Saladin), founder of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that had displaced the Fatimids in 1171. 15. Tobi argues convincingly that the expulsion of the Ottomans played a major role in the Qasimis' messianism; see "Me'ora'ot 1667 be-Teiman," 113; see also Jews ofYemen, 50. His assertion that the Qasimis' movement was "nationalist" is, of course, anachronistic.

Ultimately, they came to recognize as imam any de- scendant of Ali's son Hasan-or, less frequently, Ali's son Husayn-who was learned in Islam and could protect the community. Their imam differs from the oc- culted imam of the Twelvers and certain Ismaili groups in that he is very much alive and present in the community, and from the imams of the Twelvers and Is- mailis generally in that he must prove his ability to defend the community, by mil- itary force if necessary. What this has meant in Yemen over the centuries is that several lines of Zaydi imams have competed for authority, sometimes to the extent of attacking each other militarily. A Zaydi imamate existed in Tabaristan, in what is now northern Iran, from the ninth through the eleventh centuries.'16 It was in Yemen, however, that Zaydism took permanent root. The imam Yahya al-Hadi (d. 911), a grandson of the imam whose followers had established Zaydism in Tabaristan, migrated from Medina to Yemen in the ninth century CE to battle the militant Ismailis known as Carma- tians.'7 The Zaydi stronghold in Yemen was always the inland northern and cen- tral highland region, including Sanca. Apart from the Sulayhid interlude, the Is- mailis were concentrated in the central highlands, while the coast was the preserve of Sunni Muslims of the Shafi'i legal rite. In 1538, an Ottoman naval force under the Hungarian eunuch admiral Khadim Siileyman Pasha conquered Yemen from the local Shafi'i Arab Tahirid dynasty. 18 Ottoman governors ofYemen cobbled to- gether a working relationship with the Shafi'i and Ismaili populations but faced near-constant resistance from one line of Zaydi imams or another. In the late six- teenth century, a major rebellion erupted, led by Imam al-Mutahhar ibn Sharaf al- Din, which was finally crushed by Sinan Pasha in what one chronicler has chris- tened the "second conquest of Yemen."'9 At the end of the sixteenth century, however, a new line of Zaydi imams, led by Imam al-Qasim al-Mansur, came to power. Al-Qasim's son, al-Mu'ayyad Bil- lah Muhammad, finally ousted the Ottomans from Yemen entirely in 1636.20 This dynasty, the Qasimis, were ruling Yemen when the Jews were expelled. The third Qasimi imam, al-Mu'ayyad's brother al-Mutawakkil (r. 1644-76), enjoyed a posi- tion of authority in Yemen arguably unequaled since the height of the Sulayhid dy- 16.

Building upon his brother's geopolitical accomplishments, al-Mutawakkil expanded his territory until it nearly equaled that controlled by the Sulayhids.21 His expansionism combined the traditional Zaydi imam al-difaca (imam of de- fense), who defends his community by armed might if necessary, with a new geopolitical assertiveness. ZAYDI MESSIANISM AND JEWISH MESSIANISM In a Muslim ruler's attempt to follow the example of the Prophet Muham- mad, the treatment of non-Muslim populations was frequently the linchpin, par- ticularly in the Arabian peninsula, where the Prophet carried out his mission. Zay- di chronicler Yahya ibn al-Husayn notes that in 945 AH/1538-39 CE, the time of the Ottoman conquest of Yemen, debate raged as to whether the Jews could con- tinue to live as protected non-Muslims (sing. dhimmi) in Yemen.22 In 1568, the Qasimis' predecessor as anti-Ottoman Zaydi militant, the rebellious Imam al-Mu- tahhar, had persecuted the Jews of Sanda, whom he accused of aiding the Ottomans, and also antagonized Yemen's Sunni population by ordering the cursing of the first three caliphs recognized by Sunni Muslims in all of Yemen's mosques during Fri- day midday prayers.23 Given this precedent, it is perhaps not surprising that emulation of the Prophet formed the core of the Zaydi response to the messianic "waves" of 1667, unquestionably one of the most intense outbreaks of millennial expectation ever to engulfYemen's Jewish community. This outbreak occurred in the wake of and was probably colored by (even if it were not directly a part of) the messianic movement of Sabbatai Sevi. Sevi, the son of a merchant in the Ottoman port of Izmir, which at that time was coming into its own as a cosmopolitan, rather tumultuous entre- p0t,24 in 1665 had declared himself the long-awaited Jewish messiah. The prose- lytizing mission that ensued prompted the Ottoman authorities to imprison him first in Istanbul, then in Gallipoli, where he ultimately converted to Islam in 1666.25 Egypt received news of Sabbatai Sevi's mission from the letters of his inde- 21.

Nathan's letters were in turn transmitted to Yemen by Rafael Joseph Chelebi, banker to the Ottoman governor of Egypt and head of Egypt's Jewish community, an early supporter of Sabbatai Sevi who became the amanuensis of his proselytizing effort.26 Although Sanda's Jews knew of Sabbatai Sevi's mission by 1666,27 they were apparently unaware of his conversion to Islam until several years after the event. Thus, the outbursts of 1667 would have occurred in response to Sabbatai Sevi's presumed messiah status, not to his apostasy.28 The first of these outbreaks took the form of a "typical" Sabbatian ecstasy: the Jews, believing the messiah's appearance to be imminent, hailed the end of Muslim rule and began to sell their property, apparently in preparation for their in- gathering to Jerusalem. This prompted Imam al-Mutawakkil to summon the lead- ers of the Jewish community to his capital at al-Suda, northwest of Sanca, where he detained them and considered executing them as rebels before releasing all but one, Sulayman al-Naqqash, whom he imprisoned on Kamran Island in the Red Sea. He also issued a decree forbidding Jews to wear turbans, a sign of respectable rank.29 Shortly thereafter, the Jews of Sanda anointed a community leader, Sulay- man (Shlomo) Jamal, messiah; as van Koningsveld, Sadan, and al-Samarrai note, it is possible that he was regarded as the messiah of the house of Joseph (mashiah ben Yosef), who is supposed to precede the Davidic messiah (mashiah ben David). Sulayman then marched to the palace of the Zaydi governor of Sanca, al-Mu- tawakkil's nephew 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad Billah, and proceeded to demand, appar- ently in either Hebrew or Aramaic, that the governor yield his place of authority to him. Sulayman was ultimately executed.30 The consequences to the Jews of Sanca and vicinity from these incidents fol- lowed an intense discussion among Yemen's leading ulema, Zaydi and Shafi'i (though not, apparently, Ismaili), regarding the changes in the Jews' legal status wrought by this upheaval. Imam al-Mutawakkil, adhering to the Prophetic custom of legal consultation, exchanged written opinions with the ulema; a number of these have been preserved in Zaydi chronicles. The Muslim authorities without ex- ception regarded these incidents as a rebellion against Qasimi rule and against Muslim rule in general. Al-Mutawakkil agreed with the majority of the ulema that 26.

They were thus no longer dhimmis but slaves of the imam. The imam confiscated Jewish-owned land, forcing many Jews out of agriculture altogether, and imposed an indemnity on the Jews.31 After a number of months, al-Mutawakkil abolished the indemnity and returned the land on condition that the Jews remit half their crops to the state; this was in keeping with the penalty that the Prophet had im- posed on the Jews of Khaybar, an oasis town in the Hijaz, after he besieged and defeated them in 628 CE.32 Even Jewish chroniclers acknowledge that the imam, under Islamic law, had the prerogative of executing those involved in the messianic outburst as rebels against Muslim rule; by the same token, he could have attacked the Jews militari- ly. The measures he took, in this light, seem lenient.33 Shortly before his death in 1676, however, al-Mutawakkil transmitted a legal opinion (fatwa) that the Jews should be expelled from Yemen. In this, he believed he was again imitating the Prophet, who pronounced the saying, or hadith, "Akhrijfi al- Yahiad min jazTrat al- CArab" ("Expel the Jews from the Arabian peninsula [literally 'island of the Arabs']") on his deathbed, according to a tradition accepted by the Zaydis.34 Giv- ing new vitality to the imam's duty, again as representative of the Prophet, to "com- mand right and forbid wrong" (al-amr bi'l-ma rifwa'l-nahy can al-munkar),35 al- Mutawakkil exercised his power of ijtihad, or independent legal reasoning, to reinterpret this saying. It had long been the consensus of most Muslim juriscon- suits, both Sunni and Shiite, that jazlrat al-'Arab in this hadith was synonymous with the Hijaz, and that the Hijaz, in turn, constituted the western coastal plain of Arabia, including Mecca and Medina but excluding Yemen.36 Al-Mutawakkil, however, insisted that Yemen was included, and that therefore its Jews must be ex- pelled. Al-Mutawakkil's opinion was not translated into action until at least a year after his death, when the new imam, his nephew al-Mahdi Ahmad, issued a formal order of expulsion.37 In carrying out his uncle's dying wish, he was likewise car- 31.

As described above, the Jews of San'a and the northern and central highland regions left their homes and decamped to Mawzae, where the imam supposedly expected them to await transportation to a "safe haven""38 but where many of them suffered horribly and even died. The order was rescinded or lapsed by 1681 at the latest, at least in part because of the gap the Jews' departure had left in the manufacture of handicrafts, in which the Jews had concentrated following the appropriation of their land in 1667.39 Their dhimma, annulled in 1667, was ultimately reinstated, as well. They did not recover their homes, however, which had been occupied by Muslims, nor did they return to the land. In sum, the series of events that followed the messianic waves permanently altered the social and economic status of the Jews of Yemen, although the com- munity survived.40 JEWISH MESSIANISM IN YEMENI COLLECTIVE MEMORY While the Zaydi reaction to the 1667 events was unquestionably informed by the desire to follow the example of the Prophet Muhammad, it was also imbued with a Zaydi messianic fervor peculiar to the Qasimi dynasty. In keeping with the concept of the imam al-difaca, the active defender of the community, a prospective Zaydi imam does not automatically succeed to the imamate but launches a "call" (da'wa) to which the community must respond. In Yemen's history, one line of Zay- di imams has succeeded another by means of an effective da wa, particularly at a moment of crisis. The Qasimi imams came to power during a period of disarray among the Zaydi population following the Ottoman defeat of al-Mutahhar's revolt; al-Mutahhar's sons had occupied themselves with their own infighting until the Ot- toman governor of Yemen exiled them to Anatolia.41 As the decidedly pro-Qasimi chronicler Yahya ibn al-Husayn reports, before al-Qasim al-Mansur launched his dacwa in 1598, a cry had been heard in the night for two months: "Ya Imam al- Qasim!" ("O Imam al-Qasim!"), as if the Zaydi community was itself awaiting a deliverer.42 Not coincidentally, this brand of Zaydi messianism finds echoes in the mes- how long the exile lasted. Ratzaby, mainly on the basis of Jewish sources, places the order in 1678 and the initial expulsion (of the Jews of San'a) shortly thereafter that same year; he has the expulsion de- cree lapsing only after al-Mahdi's death in 1681. See Ratzaby, "Galut Mavza'," Sefunot 5, 343 -44, and, in contrast, idem, EJ, s.v. "Mawza'." Van Koningsveld, Sadan, and al-Samarrai, based on a Zaydi source, place the order in 1677 and the initial expulsions the same year; their discussion implies, how- ever, that the governor of San'a postponed the expulsion from that city until 1679, after a theological consultation had been completed; see Yemenite Authorities, 22-23, 104. 38.

As a lat- er Zaydi chronicler recounts, the Jews expected that "a voice will be heard by every living soul on earth" to signal the coming of their (false) messiah-whom the chronicler identifies with the Dajjal, the "antichrist," who in Muslim eschatology is supposed to appear shortly before the messianic figure known as the Mahdi.43 Both noises echo the cries, on the one hand, and the shouts, horns, and thunder, on the other, prophesied by the biblical prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah as signs, re- spectively, of Israel's devastation and subsequent redemption.44 As for the expul- sion itself, Habshush, writing in a quasi-biblical idiom, describes Imam al-Mah- di's wrath as descending like an earthquake on the heads of the Jews.45 The analogy between Jewish and Zaydi messianism in Yemen goes deeper still. Sulayman Jamal, the Jewish community leader who took the role of proto- messiah, publicly declared that Jews would displace Muslims as the rulers of Yemen-as they would throughout the entire Muslim world. When he made this declaration on the steps of the governor's palace in Sanda, he was garbed all in white, which would have registered with the Zaydi authorities as the traditional col- or of Shiite rebellion and martyrdom.46 In Yemen, furthermore, this declaration had singular resonance, for Yemen's rulers had once been Jews, as most Yemeni Muslims, even the common people, were aware. The ancient Himyarite kings of Yemen, subject of countless popular legends, including the well-known epic of Sayf ben Dhi Yazan,47 had converted to Judaism sometime in the early centuries of the Common Era. Modern-day scholars disagree on the exact date, but popular tradition maintains that the fabled third-century ruler, or tubbac, As'ad al-Himyari, also known as Madi Qarib, was the first to convert.48 As'ad was a familiar figure to Muslims of all sects. Ibn Ishaq's well-known life history of the Prophet Muham- mad (STrat RasiilAlldh) begins with As'ad, whose monotheism prefigures that of Muhammad, as does his veneration of the Ka'ba in Mecca: As'ad, according to tra- 43.

Popular belief in Yemen held that a Himyarite ruler would return at the end of time, rather like King Arthur in British folk eschatology. The Ismaili messianic figure whose forcible conversion of Jews to Islam prompted Maimonides' Epistle to the Jews of Yemen styled himself "al-Himyari," evidently playing on this messianic expectation by posing as a Himyarite descendant (see n. 3). In 1578, early in the twenty-five-year tenure of the Ottoman governor Hasan Pasha ibn Husayn, according to Yahya ibn al-Husayn, a man from Bilad Anis, in the northern highlands, claimed to be the resurrected "Mansur Himyar." By Yahya's account, many people followed him un- til he was seized and brought to Hasan Pasha, who promptly put him to death.51 The Qasimi dynasty was born in the midst of Zaydi messianic expectations, and Imam al-Mutawakkil clearly meant to exploit, if not to fulfill, these expecta- tions. If his father had been the great deliverer and his brother the vanquisher of the Ottomans, he was the recreator of the ideal Muslim community; his efforts to emulate the Prophet Muhammad are noteworthy in this regard. As the exposer of the false Jewish messiah, whom the Zaydi ulema identified with the Dajjal, the "deceiver" who appears just before the Mahdi, al-Mutawakkil himself took on the attributes of a Mahdi-like figure. But had he not imprisoned the Jewish commu- nity leaders, executed their false messiah Sulayman Jamal, and, ultimately, elect- ed to expel the Jews entirely, Jewish "false" messianism would have compromised the triumph of the correct Zaydi variety. The expulsion decision thus capped his attempts to recreate in Yemen the Prophet's original community at Medina- a purely Muslim utopia-with himself as a quasi-messianic successor to the Prophet.

Although the Qasimis had expelled the Ottomans from Yemen in the 1630s, the Ottomans still held the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and outfitted two enormous pil- grimage caravans every year that provided the ceremonial covering for the Kacba and distributed large amounts of grain and money to the poor of the holy cities. That the Ottomans were keenly aware of this rivalry is attested by the fact that in the very year that the last Ottoman governor ofYemen was expelled, a bey of Egypt rebuilt the Ka'ba, which had been badly damaged in a flood.52 Indeed, Yosef Tobi asserts that the Qasimi imamate derived legitimacy and ideological fervor from its success in expelling the Ottomans from Yemen (see n. 15). By the same token, we can argue that Imam al-Mutawakkil'sfatwa sanction- ing the expulsion of the Jews, as well as his nephew's implementation of the fat- wa, were triggered in part by renewed Ottoman militancy in the region. This was not the first time that Qasimi treatment of the Jewish minority had been influenced by Ottoman designs onYemen. The debate over the Jews' dhimma in 1538-39 had occurred just as Siileyman Pasha was claiming Yemen for the Ottomans, who had conquered Egypt and the holy cities only twenty years before, while the Arab lands were still absorbing the influx of Sephardic Jewry from the Spanish expulsion in 1492. It was the Ottomans who ultimately renewed the Yemenite Jews' covenant of protection, in keeping with their earlier policy of allowing refugees from Spain to settle in Ottoman territory.53 By 1667, however, the Ottoman administrative elite had espoused the reli- gious, social, and political agenda of the Kadizadelis, a puritanical Sunni move- ment that had attained unprecedented influence at the court of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648-87). Like the Qasimi imams, the Kadizadelis strove to emulate the Prophet Muhammad, not least in their treatment of non-Muslims. Their Sunni fer- vor colored the Ottoman response to Sabbatai Sevi's messianic movement, which had originated in Ottoman territory and whose repercussions affected first and foremost the Ottoman Empire itself. Indeed, Sabbatai Sevi was converted to Islam by the leader of the movement at the time, the sultan's spiritual advisor Vani Mehmed Efendi, whose chamberlain Sabbatai Sevi (now called CAziz Mehmed Efendi) became.

Indeed, the Kadizadelis' attempts to emulate the Prophet Muhammad by re- creating the original Muslim community at Medina bear an obvious resemblance to those of al-Mutawakkil. It would not be farfetched to describe the religious tenor of both Ottoman Istanbul and Zaydi Sanda in the later seventeenth century as es- chatologically charged. While the Kadizadelis struggled to root out innovations, notably Sufism, that they felt prevented Ottoman society from returning to the pris- tine state of the original Muslim community, Mehmed IV had found in the K6priilii family of grand viziers renewers of the empire's military prowess against the infi- del enemy, both Christian and sectarian Muslim. Under Kdpriilii Fazil Ahmed Pasha, who held the grand vizierate for an astonishing fifteen years, from 1661 un- til his death in 1676, the Ottomans at long last forced the Venetians to cede the fortress of Candia on Crete, which they had defended for twenty-five years.55 The disappearance of the last Christian (more specifically Roman Catholic) toehold in the eastern Mediterranean was a substantial blow to Venice; to this day, an icon of the Virgin Mary rescued from Candia stands in Venice's Basilica Santa Maria del- la Salute as a memorial to the defeat.56 Ultimately, Mehmed would set his sights on the bastion of Roman Catholic might in Europe: the Hapsburg capital of Vienna, which the Kipriilii nephew Kara Mustafa Pasha, encouraged by Vani Mehmed Efendi, besieged in 1683, only to be routed by Polish relief forces assisted by rain and mud. Vienna is often identified with the mysterious Kizil Elma, or "Red/Golden Apple," the city whose conquest represents an eschatological watershed in early Ottoman lore.57 In the fifteenth century, Constantinople was the obvious candidate for the title. The conquest of Constantinople, moreover, bears similarly eschatological overtones in certain Prophetic hadiths, in which the city's capture by Muslims is predicted to precede the appearance of the Dajjal.58 By the seventeenth century, the Hapsburgs had re- placed the Byzantines as the Ottomans' chief rival; thus, their capital at Vienna as- sumed the status of coveted, almost sacrosanct, prize.59 More broadly, the fact that 54.

In this scheme of things, Yemen emerged as the southern extreme of the rein- vigorated Ottomanjihad. Sultan Mehmed was painfully aware of the Ottoman loss of Yemen under his uncle, Murad IV, in 1636--ironically, only two years before Murad reconquered Baghdad from the Twelver Shiite Safavid dynasty of Iran. As I have noted elsewhere, the Ottoman defeat by the Qasimis was a draining, de- moralizing affair that leads one to suspect that the sultan and his grand vizier had elected to let Yemen go. The Ottoman governor fled to the Hijaz, leaving a provin- cial grandee (bey) from Egypt to hold the southern port of Mocha against the fi- nal Zaydi assault. This bey's pleas to the governor of Egypt for reinforcements fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, his remaining troops fell victim to disease, starvation, and desertion to the Zaydi imam.60 Ottoman contact with Yemen did not end with this military disaster. The dis- covery of coffee in Ethiopia in the fifteenth century, its cultivation in Yemen, and its export through the Yemeni ports of Aden and Mocha had given rise to a lucra- tive coffee trade through the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; indeed, the revenues generated by this trade were a key incentive for the Ottomans to retain Yemen.61 Even after their ouster, the coffee trade, largely Ottoman-carried, continued apace. Toward the middle of the seventeenth century, in fact, Egyptian grandee house- holds began to form around the coffee trade and grow rich off it.62 Regrettably lit- tle is known about the alliances that the grandees of Egypt must have forged with the (primarily Ismaili) tribes of the coffee-growing regions inYemen's central high- lands. We gather, however, that Ottoman grandees competed with the Zaydi imam for coffee revenues.

Mehmed IV's reign witnessed an up- surge in pious endowments (sing. waqfin Arabic; valafin Turkish) benefiting the holy cities by the women of the Ottoman family. In particular, Mehmed's favorite concubine (hasseki), Rabi'a Giilnu$ Emetullah, in 1678 founded a huge waqfpro- viding for a soup kitchen and hospital in Mecca, as well as the shipment of grain from Egypt to the holy cities; the revenues came from four Egyptian villages and the Nile port of Bulaq.65 Mehmed IV simply could not risk al-Mutawakkil's ad- vancing northward into the Hijaz; the sharifof Mecca, a descendant of the Prophet who administered that city on behalf of the Ottomans, kept a garrison at Hali, the northernmost outpost in Yemen, bordering the Hijaz, to prevent just such an even- tuality.66 For not only would al-Mutawakkil be challenging Ottoman territorial control of the Hijaz; he would be threatening the sultan's status as khadim al-Hara- mayn and, indeed, his claim to leadership of the Muslim community. We know, in any case, that Mehmed contemplated an attack on Yemen in 167267--hoping, per- haps, to catch al-Mutawakkil overextended and vulnerable. Had a few things gone a bit differently, Mehmed IV might have found him- self ruling an empire that stretched from Poland to the Indian Ocean, with no Catholic or Shiite rival to threaten him. He might then have earned a place in Ot- toman annals as sahib-i kbran, literally "master of an auspicious [astrological] con- junction," a title bestowed by Ottoman men of letters on the likes of Alexander the Great, Tamerlane, and Genghis Khan.68 He might conceivably have been a candi- date for a more eschatologically-laden status: that of mujaddid, or "renewer."

The title had been bestowed on Siileyman I and, by one prominent statesman, on Selim I, the conqueror of Egypt.69 Admittedly, this is a rather different view of Mehmed IV from the entertainment-loving "Avcl Mehmet" (Mehmed the Hunter) described by Ozdemir Nutku, or the melancholic brooder described by J.H. Kramers. Such an achievement would have been large- ly the doing of K6prilii Fazil Ahmed.70 This distinction would have made little dif- ference to the Qasimi imam, however. CONCLUSION: THE INTERSECTION OF THREE MESSIANISMS Al-Mutawakkil and Mehmed IV must have taken these eschatologically- charged measures in some degree of conscious opposition to each other. Al-Mu- tawakkil was well aware that the Ottomans constituted a perennial threat to Yemen. Among other things, the Ottomans excelled at exploiting the divisions among Yemen's various Muslim populations. During their lengthy struggle with the Qasimis, they employed at least one son of the defeated non-Qasimi imam al-Mu- tahhar as a spy while keeping four sons, to say nothing of several Ismaili grandees, on their payroll as salyane (salaried) emirs.71 Al-Mutawakkil's assertiveness, both territorially and doctrinally, aimed, at one level, to prove his legitimacy in the face of the similarly assertive Ottoman sultan. The status ofYemen's Jews was a potential flashpoint for the competing Zay- di and Ottoman eschatological visions. If Mehmed IV had succeeded in re-con- quering Yemen, then Yemen's Jews would have become Ottoman subjects once more. Jerusalem, the eschatological destination of those Jews swept up in the mes- sianic fervor, would have been far more accessible to them: a district in another province of the same empire. Thus, Mehmed could have served as a facilitator of the Jews' messianic vision comparable to the Achaemenid emperor Cyrus the Great, who invited the Jews of the Babylonian captivity back to Jerusalem to re- build their Temple (2 Chronicles 36:22-23; also Isaiah 41:2-3, 44:28-45:5, 46:11). (Two centuries later, in fact, many Yemeni Jews would take advantage of the second Ottoman occupation of Yemen, which lasted from 1872 through 1918, to emigrate to Jerusalem and other parts of Ottoman Palestine.)72 It is even worth 69.

This wave of messianic zeal washed over Yemen at a particularly critical juncture in the fortunes of the Qasimi dynasty. Having itself come to power in an atmosphere heavy with messianic expectation, the dynasty, in the person of Imam al-Mutawakkil, was undertaking an unprecedented surge of territorial expansion- territorial expansion colored, however, by these very messianic expectations. Al- Mutawakkil and his nephew al-Mahdi appeared to be fervently striving to recreate in Yemen a mirror image of the original Muslim community that the Prophet Muhammad had established in Medina. Their efforts toward that end resonate all the more because Medina itself was in the hands of the Ottomans, a competing and, in Zaydi eyes, illegitimate Muslim authority. In such circumstances, an outburst of militant Jewish messianism provoked a severe response, but a response carefully crafted after exhaustive theological debate and deliberately based upon Prophetic precedent. Even the notorious treatise in support of al-Mutawakkil's opinion and al-Mahdi's order by the Zaydi jurist Ahmad ibn Abi'l-Rijal (1620-81) bases its ar- guments almost solely on the Koran and hadith.73 Al-Mutawakkil's and al-Mahdi's measures against the Jews become even more comprehensible when we recall the heterogeneity of Yemen's religious envi- ronment, with significant Sunni/Shafi'i and Ismaili communities in addition to the Zaydi population. No one ever ruled "all" of Yemen; even if the Zaydi imam man- aged to garrison and collect taxes from most of the territory, he could never hope to win the hearts and minds of his Sunni and Ismaili subjects. Any disturbance by a non-Muslim religious minority was a potential source of social disruption that could shatter the imam's tenuous grip on territorial authority. If we add to this the imam's wariness of the Ottomans at a time when the Ottoman sultan was reinvig- orating the jihad on all fronts, we can easily see that no disturbance of the kind provoked by the messianic fervor of 1667 could be tolerated. It is easy to see, fur- thermore, why such a disturbance would have been regarded as outright rebellion, even if Sulayman Jamal had not verbally challenged Zaydi authority. The Mawza' exile, then, resulted from the intersection of a distinct regional brand of Jewish messianism with the geopolitical confrontation between an ex- Turkish Rule (1872-1918)," in Jews of Yemen, 96ff.; Klorman, Jews of Yemen in the Nineteenth Cen- tury, ch. 6; EJ, s.v.

Although the Zaydi tradition of a living imam who rendered independent juridical decisions clearly expedited the reinterpreta- tion of the hadith that justified the Jews' expulsion, no particular doctrinal element of Zaydi Islam-or, for that matter, Sunni Islam of the Hanafi rite as practiced by the Ottomans-determined the Qasimi imam al-Mahdi's expulsion order. Rather, the expulsion was conditioned by this particular conjunction of Ottoman revival- ism and Qasimi militancy. When rival sects of Islam, or interpretations within a single sect, collided, emulation of the Prophet was often the focus of doctrinal com- petition, and in this context, treatment of non-Muslim minority populations be- came a key public manifestation of such emulation. The tribulations of Yemen's Jews in the years following the Sabbatian movement can be understood in terms of this broader struggle.
