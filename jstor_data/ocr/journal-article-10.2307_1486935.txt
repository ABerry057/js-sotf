<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reinier Munk. The Rationale of Halakhic Man: Joseph B. Soloveitchiks Conception of Jewish Thought. Amsterdam Studies in Jewish Thought 3. Amsterdam: J. C. Gieben, 1996. ix, 144 pp. Several major Jewish thinkers have attracted concentrated study and investigation by contemporary students of Jewish thought. Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, and, more recently, Emmanuel Levinas have each had several books and numerous articles exploring the significance of their life and works. The Orthodox Jewish thinker Joseph B. Soloveitchik (1903-1993), however, while the subject of essays by writers such as Eugene Borowitz, Hillel Goldberg, David Hartman, Lawrence Kaplan, and Ehud Luz, has not had a full-length monograph devoted to his work until Munk's book. Soloveitchik's importance lies in his being, in Hillel Goldberg's words, a "Jewish transition figure." He spanned several diverse and disconnected worlds. He was a talmudic scholar from the Volozhin school of talmudic learning, and yet he was trained at the University of Berlin, where he earned a Ph.D. for a dissertation on the Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen. He trained a generation of talmudic scholars and influenced a generation of Jewish thinkers, two groups that generally tread separate pathways. Students remember his intellectual calm or his warm piety. David Hartman, for example, describes how Soloveitchik tried to temper the enthusiasm with which Hartman greeted the Israeli victory in the Six-Day War. Hartman</page><page sequence="2">336 BOOK REVIEWS pictures Soloveitchik as an intellectual mentor providing an example of how to combine traditional Jewish Orthodox living with an engagement with the entire Western philosophical tradition.' In contrast, Hillel Goldberg emphasizes the emotional appeal of Soloveitchik's religious life and remarks upon "the piety that leaves one of his closest disciples less with the memory of illuminating lectures, more with the image of Rabbi Soloveitchik beatifically reciting hallel at the seder table."2 Soloveitchik the rationalist contrasts with Soloveitchik the pious Jew. Soloveitchik himself argued that his ideal spanned both personality types. Not only did he describe the halakhic personality as bringing the cognitive and the religious together, but he made that unity the basis for his ontology of religious experience. In a footnote to his "Ish ha-Halakha," Soloveitchik notes that according to the midrash Abraham does not immediately begin arguing with God about the command to sacrifice his son Isaac, even though it contradicts the promise God has given him. He waits until the appearance of an angel. The reason for this lies in the fact that every contradiction in the Torah is supplemented by a third verse that reconciles them. Abraham has two conflicting verses here, but not the necessary reconciliation. The angel's instruction to withhold his hand from slaughtering his son gives Abraham the reconciling verse. Then, and only then, can the argument proceed.3 Soloveitchik's philosophy of Judaism offers the halakhic personality as just that reconciling verse between rationalism and mystical religion. Understanding his defense of the reality of Judaism means comprehending every aspect of his synthesis and how each contributes to the complete whole. The temptation for a writer on Soloveitchik is to seek to do too much, to unravel every tangled knot in the philosophical web that he wove. Reinier Munk tries to resist this temptation by self-consciously limiting his study to Soloveitchik's ontology of the religious personality. He focuses on three essays by Soloveitchik--"Ish ha-Halakha," "U-viqqashtem mi-sham," and "The Halakhic Mind"--and on Soloveitchik's dissertation, "Das reine Denken und die Senskonstitutierung bei Hermann Cohen" (p. 10).

First, he summarizes Soloveitchik's "expositions and critique" of Cohen. Second, he explains Soloveitchik's argument that religion does indeed provide positive information about reality. Finally, he describes and evaluates Soloveitchik's legitimation of halakha as a religiously and philosophically viable approach to reality (pp. 16, 53, 124). In clarifying these ideas, Munk provides readers with a needed exposition of Soloveitchik's argument for the reality of religious knowledge, and of the philosophical prin- ciples underlying his contention that the halakhic man synthesizes cognitive man and religious man. He also helps sort out the often dissimilar typologies that Soloveitchik uses in his different essays. At the same time, Munk cannot withstand the temptation to fill in necessary gaps in his limited objectives. He cannot resist evaluating how well Soloveitchik understood Hermann Cohen (and adds a tantalizing note that because Soloveitchik did not deal with Cohen's central concept of the other, das Andere, he, Munk, must leave the idea aside! pp. 39-40). Munk supplies an appendix on the thought of Maimonides to show its relationship to Soloveitchik's thought. He also offers a chapter focused on the Volozhin school of Talmud study. Throughout he pauses to interject an evaluation or a suggestion not actually essential to his exposition. While these interjections are often interesting, they detract from the focus in the monograph. Students of modem Jewish thought will find Munk's work useful and illuminating, even if at times it may be hard to follow. S. Daniel Breslauer University of Kansas Lawrence, Kans.</page></plain_text>
