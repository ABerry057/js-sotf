<plain_text><page sequence="1">"LIKE THE MINISTERING ANGELS": RITUAL AND PURITY IN EARLY JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MAGIC by MICHAEL D. SWARTZ Students of religion' are aware that the same ritual act can have many meanings depending on the cultural context. As Walter Kaelber observes, "Viewed cross-culturally, a given ascetic form may have different, even opposite objectives."' Accordingly, the same detail may have entirely opposite meanings in different ascetic regimens. Thus for the biblical Daniel and his ascetic heirs, beans were an ideal food, probably because they are dry and not susceptible to impurity;2 but for Pythagoreans and others, they were to be avoided-perhaps because in certain Mediterranean populations, they presented an actual medical danger.3 These factors alert us to the principle that understanding a ritual system in its cultural context is vital. They also encourage us to read rituals and actions as we read texts--coding their creators' statements about what they value in a religious system and what they aspire to be. The Hekhalot literature, the texts of the visionary phenomena in Judaism of Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages known as Merkavah mysticism, describes rituals of abstention, diet, and isolation similar to ascetic practices 1.

SWARTZ common in the Greco-Roman Mediterranean world.4 By locating culturally specific dimensions of ritual texts and concepts of purity in the Hekhalot literature we can discover something about their purpose, the dynamics and mythic conceptions that underlie these texts, and the social and historical circumstances of their authors. Introduction When studying Jewish practices of abstinence, we must consider factors that are particular to the Judaism of the authors of the rabbinic canon: the influence of Halakhah and the laws and phenomenology of ritual purity.' For many communities in ancient Judaism, Halakhah delineated the criteria and structure of ritual systems, including those not ordained by normative law. Halakhah is also an important indicator of specific historical factors, such as the social position of the authors of a given text in relation to the central shapers of Rabbinic Judaism, their educational level, and matters of provenance. Consideration of the role of ritual purity is relevant because purity laws mandate avoidance of food, impure persons, and objects and 4. This study is based on research undertaken for my forthcoming book, Scholastic Magic: Ritual and Revelation in Early Jewish Mysticism. The impetus for studying rituals in the Hekhalot literature in light of the study of asceticism came in part as a result of my participation in the Society of Biblical Literature research group on ascetic behavior, whose comments in the course of discussion on these issues is much appreciated. An earlier version of this paper was first presented before that group in November, 1991. See also Michael D. Swartz, "Hkidll6t Rabbdtt ??297-306: A Ritual for the Cultivation of the Prince of the Torah," in Vincent L. Wimbush, ed., Asceticism in Greco-Roman Antiquiry: A Sourcebook (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1990), pp. 227-234. Much of the research for this study was carried out in Jerusalem under the auspices of the Yad Hanadiv/Rothschild Foundation, whose support is much appreciated. My thanks also to Professors Gary Anderson, David Halperin, Tirzah Meacham, Lawrence Schiffman, and the anonymous reviewers of this article for their insights. 5. The best consideration of asceticism in ancient Judaism is Steven D. Fraade, "Ascetical Aspects of Ancient Judaism," in Arthur Green, ed., Jewish Spirituality from the Bible Through the Middle Ages (New York: Crossroad, 1987), pp. 253-288.

For historians, these laws have also served as indicators of historical, social, and conceptual determinants in the study of ancient Judaism.6 In recent years, there has been much discussion of the social ramifications of ascetic practices. For example, ascetics can be seen as practicing what Vincent Wimbush has called "renunciation towards social engineering."7 The latter motivation applies in ascetic communities that seek to mold a way of life and alternative polity. These goals do not characterize the phenomena described here. For example, the authors of the Hekhalot literature do not seek to attain a permanent state of spiritual perfection, but to prepare for an extraordinary occurrence.8 But in both cases we can be aware of the ways in which rituals can express social roles and values. Thus studying ritual allows us to track the social dimensions of the Hekhalot literature. Gershom Scholem, who brought the importance of this literature to the attention of scholars, argued that Merkavah mysticism was the product of the early rabbis.9 Since then, there has been considerable debate about the social position of its authors. David J. Halperin and others have challenged the notion that the Hekhalot literature was a phenomenon that originated in the central circles of Rabbinic Judaism.'o Comparing these 6.

Although the historical implications of the status of rabbinic purity laws in early post-talmudic Judaism are of considerable historical interest, the subject has not been given systematic consideration since Y.

Thus the phenomenon would not satisfy the criteria set by Fraade ("Ascetical Aspects," p. 257) for a valid definition of asceticism: "(1) the exercise of disciplined effort toward the goal of spiritual perfection ... which requires (2) abstention ... from the satisfaction of otherwise permitted earthly desires." 9.

SWARTZ ritual texts with halakhah and rabbinic concepts of purity can assist us in locating the authors' relationship to the behavioral and social norms of their society." Focusing on ritual purity alerts us to another, cultural problem involved in the study of behavioral systems such as asceticism. As the body is a focus of many ascetic practices, so too, it is central in the definition and observance of ritual purity.'2 In asceticism we also can observe a tension between inner experience or intention and external ritual action. Among modern scholars, it has been common until recently to focus on the inner motivations for ascetic behavior." Yet we customarily identify asceticism in terms of such behavior. In the first two chapters of Natural Symbols, entitled, "Away from Ritual" "... to Inner Experience," Mary Douglas exposes the origins of the tendency not to take the outer manifestations of ritual behavior sufficiently seriously.14 A similar tension also exists in the study of the literature of Merkavah mysticism. Most scholars have sought to analyze the texts in terms of the experience of the individuals who wrote them." This view has dominated the way ritual has been treated in the study of these texts. The rituals of fasting, ablution, and seclusion in the literature have conventionally been considered as specifically designed for achieving the state of ecstasy usually associated with the ascent to the divine throne depicted in the Hekhalot Oriental Society, 1983) and idem, The Faces of the Chariot: Early Jewish Responses to Ezekiel's Vision (Tilbingen: Mohr, 1988). Cf. Peter Schlfer, Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992.) 11.

Scholem states, "this mystical ascent is always preceded by ascetic practices."'6 For Ithamar Gruenwald, dietary prohibitions are to be explained chiefly in terms of their effect on the physical strength and consciousness of the mystic." There is no denying that fasting, diet, and seclusion are likely to have an effect on the individual's consciousness. However, as it is difficult to determine motivations for ascetic behavior without the subject's personal testimony, so too it is difficult to assess the degree to which inner experience is reflected in this anonymous, highly conventional literature.'8 Moreover, few of these rituals have been analyzed in detail.19 If we defer the question of the inner experience that may lie behind these practices, we can in fact learn a great deal from them. The Hekhalot Literature The Hekhalot literature took shape in the period of the classical Talmuds and midrashim and afterward, from the third to the eighth century C.E. Many of the major texts of the Hekhalot literature are pseudepigraphic accounts of the ascent of a rabbi, usually Rabbi Ishmael or Rabbi Akiba, through the chambers of heaven, the Hekhalot, to the chariot-throne of God, the Merkavah. Also prominent in the corpus, however, are texts which concern the cultivation of angels such as the Prince of the Torah (Sar-Torah), who will bring the individual skill in learning and other benefits. The study of the corpus under discussion entails a complex set of literary- critical questions.20 Because of the composite nature of the literature, we 16. Gershom Scholem, Major Trends, p. 49.

SWARTZ have to pay particular attention to source-critical and form-critical criteria.2 We will also be aided by cosmological texts, rabbinic halakhah, and magical handbooks found in the Cairo Genizah and other collections.22 Although the prevalence of magic in the Hekhalot literature has been recognized,23 Jewish magical literature has not been employed systematically for understanding the phenomenology and dynamics of rituals in the Hekhalot texts.24 It will be seen that affinities between the two corpora go beyond specific details of magical names and techniques to substantial matters of their world-views and notions of ritual efficacy. Ritual and Vision Recently the view that ritual is used in the Hekhalot literature as prepara- tion for the trance that will produce the vision of the ascent has been called Hekhalot-Literatur (Ttibingen: Mohr, 1981) and his Geniza-Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literat ur (Ttibingen: Mohr, 1984).

While Naomi Janowitz, Poetics of Ascent: Theories of Language in a Rabbinic Ascent Text (Albany: SUNY Press, 1989), discusses theories of magic and magical language in her study of Ma'aseh Merkavah, she does not deal with Jewish magical literature specifically. However, there has been increasing attention to magical texts and their implications for the Hekhalot literature.</page><page sequence="7">RITUAL AND PURITY IN EARLY JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MAGIC 141 into question.25 The first clear evidence for the notion that ritual preparation is necessary for the vision of the heavens is found in a responsum by the eleventhth-century Babylonian rabbinic leader Hai Gaon. This discussion has been very influential in setting the tone for how this literature has been studied.26 In the responsum, Hai describes the Hekhalot literature as he understands it: Perhaps you know that many of the sages believed that whoever is worthy, [possessing] several [moral] attributes which are mentioned and specified, when he wants to see the Merkavah and glimpse the Hekhalot of the angels on high, there are ways of doing so. He is to sit in fasting a certain number of days, and lay his head between his knees, and whisper27 many songs and praises, which are specified, to the ground. And so you can glimpse inside it and its chambers as one who sees with his eyes the seven Hekhalot and sees as if he is entering from one Hekhal to another, and sees what is in it.28 David Halperin has shown that Hai Gaon's account of the phenomenon can be traced to an extant written source, a passage in what has come to be known as Hekhalot Zutarti.29 Furthermore, according to Halperin, Hai has misunderstood that passage. The text reads: Rabbi Akiba said: Whoever wishes to repeat this mishnah and to pronounce the name in its full elaboration,3" must sit fasting for forty days and rest his head 25. See David J. Halperin, "A New Edition of Hekhalot Literature," Journal of the American Oriental Society 104 (1984): 550. See also Schafer, "Aim and Purpose," p. 284; and Martha Himmelfarb, Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 106-110. 26. See, for example, Scholem, Major Trends, p. 49. 27. Lohesh. Often used of incantations. 28. B. M. Lewin, ed, Osar ha-Ge'oninm (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1931), vol. 4 (H.agigah), p. 14. 29. Halperin, "New Edition," p. 550. It is unclear whether Hai is working from purely literary sources (as Halperin assumes), from second-hand oral reports quoting this passage, or a combination of these. His statement there that "this matter is well-known" (niefursam ve-yedua') would argue against the view that he must have had the actual text of Hekhalot Zutarti before him. However, neither does it mean that his informants were first-hand witnesses to the phenomenon. 30. Le-faresh et ha-shem be-ferusho.

Then he must whisper to the ground and not to heaven, so that the earth will hear and not heaven. If he is married, he must be prepared,31 for three days, as it is written: "Be prepared; do not go near a woman" [Exod. 19:15].... He should do this regularly every month and every year for thirty days before the New Year from the first of Elul to the Day of Atonement so that no satan or evil plague will attack him all year. Here the fast is undertaken in preparation for the recitation of the powerful divine name. The reason the practitioner is to rest his head between his knees is so that he can avoid fainting and "so that the earth will hear," and not so that he will obtain a vision.32 As Halperin observes, "It is hard to imagine how any of this could fit in with the heavenly ascensions. But, as a forty-day ritual designed to insure a favorable decision on the day of judgment, it makes some sense."33 It is useful to look at this passage in context to see how such a misunderstanding may have come about. Hekhalot Zutarti is a set of discrete traditions regarding the Merkavah and the angels surrounding the throne, the potent names by which heaven and earth were created, and other matters.34 ?424 is one of a series of testimonies appended to the ascent traditions that take up the bulk of Hekhalot Zutarti at a later stage in its redaction. In the previous testimony (?423), Rabbi Akiba hears a voice (bat qol) from below the divine Throne saying that the mystic who has been painstaking in the ascent and descent to the Merkavah will "receive God's blessing three times a day, every day in the supernal court and in the earthly court in which they repeat (shonlin) it." The blessings thus result from the recitation of the text. Similarly, ?424 lists the benefits of reciting "this mishnah," that is, the ascent texts that precede it, which presumably contain the powerful divine name. This passage resembles statements found in the Shi'ur Qomah and other texts regarding the power of a book or tradition.35 In contrast to the 31. That is, refrain from marital relations; see Halperin, "New Edition," p. 550. 32. Cf. ?489 in which the practitioner is to cast his eyes down so as to avoid gazing at the divine presence. 33.

On the redaction of Hekhalot Zutarti, see Peter Schafer, "Aufbau und redactionelle Identitdt der Hekhalot Zutarti," in Hekhalot-Studien, pp. 50-62; on Hekhalot Zutarti, see also Rachel Elior's edition of the text: Hekhalot Zutarti, Mehqere Yerushalayim be-Mahishevet Yisra'el, supplement 1 (1982) and Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, 142-149. 35. See, for example, ?377 (-940) in Shi'ur Qonmah; ?500 (= 712), an independent testimony; and ?547 (from Ma'aseh Merkavah). Note too that ?424-426 is followed in all of</page><page sequence="9">RITUAL AND PURITY IN EARLY JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MAGIC 143 body of the texts themselves, which deal with the journey to heaven or the nature of God, these testimonies promise very palpable rewards.36 Because of its placement in the redactional structure of Hekhalot Zutarti, ?424 then came to be regarded as describing the ascetic ritual that accompanied the ascent of the tannaim to the Merkavah. This is probably how Hai Gaon understood it. Indeed, this interpretation made sense to the redactor who placed this testimony there in the first place. To him, the ascent texts in Hekhalot Zutarti were no less deserving of such a testimony than those texts in the corpus that have more practical goals, such as the Sar-Torah texts. Nor is the mention of a fasting ritual a surprising feature of this passage. Similar testimonies, especially in the introductions to magical books, make a point of specifying the exceptional conditions under which the book or tradition must be used. Among these conditions are ritual purity and a regimen of preparation. An introduction to a magical book from the Cairo Genizah (TS K1.21) provides an example." The text enumerates the wonderful things the magical names and spells in the book will accomplish: In!)5 nrinw)l~ Iin~ the principal manuscripts in the Synopse except for MS Munich 22 by ?489-495, which is also an elaborate ritual for reciting a book. On this literary pattern attesting to the origins and power of the text, see Michael D. Swartz, "Book and Tradition in Hekhalot and Magical Literatures," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy (in press). 36. So too, a set of hymns that introduce Hekhalot Rabbati (?83-92) praise the glories (gedullah) available to anyone who knows the text's secrets, including the ability to tell simply by looking at a person how many illegitimate ancestors he has, and the horrid punishments that will befall his enemies. On these hymns, see Gerd Wewers, "Der Oberlegenheit des Mystikers: Zur Aussage der Gedulla-Hymnen in Hekhalot Rabbati 1,2-2,3," Journal for the Study of Judaism 17 (1986): 3-22. 37. This introduction is parallel to the introduction to Sefer ha-Malbush (printed in Sefer Raziel [Amsterdam, 1701], fol. 2b), and to Sefer ha-Razimn 2:8-10; cf. 5:34-35. See Margalioth, Sefer ha-Razimn, pp. 33-34.</page><page sequence="10">144 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ And if he recites it [the magical name] over a snake or venomous serpent or scorpion, reptile or creeping thing, he can play with them as [with] a bird, and if [he recites it] over the sun and the moon, he can have mastery over them as a righteous man has mastery of the fear of God,38 and likewise over any spirit and plague and demon and satan and shadow, male or female, if he recites it, they will listen to his voice. And if he recites it over battle and war, [the enemy] will be broken before him. (lines 3-8) This is a typical passage in which the powers of the magical names contained in the book are advertised. The text continues, however, with detailed instructions as to how the book is to be used: 01.) /KID n 1nYY n;n, n Xv,. -, t):= And anyone who would apply this book, let him purify himself for 21 days, [that is,] three weeks of days, and not eat during them any onion or garlic, nor meat or any smaller [animal], nor anything that produces blood.39 Every single day he should run over the trough and bathe in purity once in the morning40 and once at twilight. And he should not apply [the book] arrogantly, but in humility 38. The translation of this phrase is uncertain. Cf. ?225, in which Rabbi Nehuniah is said to "have mastery of the light of Torah" (moshel ba-'or shel Torah). Another possible meaning is that the person will be able to rule by means of the sun and moon (moshel barn) "as a righteous man rules by means of the fear of God." That is, by employing solar and lunar divination the magician will be able to achieve the same power that a saint possesses by virtue of his righteousness. 39. Heb., mosi dam. Cf. Prov. 30:33.

It will make anyone who applies it wise and clever. (lines 10-18)41 As in the testimony in Hekhalot Zurarti, the juxtaposition of the themes of the practical uses for the book and the regimen for reciting it in purity and sincerity serves to impress on the reader the book's sacred and powerful qualities. The inclusion of ritual prescriptions in Hekhalot and magical texts thus has a rhetorical as well as practical function.42 The Sar-Torah texts In the extant Hekhalot literature, then, fasting is not explicitly prescribed for the purpose of the vision of the Merkavah. Rather, regimens of fasts, abstentions, and ablutions occur primarily in those texts that concern the recitation of a divine name and the conjuration of an angel to come to the practitioner. Most of these texts fall within the genre known as the Sar-Torah literature.43 In these texts the protagonist (usually Rabbi Ishmael) is instructed how to get the Angel or Prince of the Torah (Sar ha-Torah) to come to him and endow him with exceptional skill in memory and learning.44 41. Cf. Ma'aseh Merkavah ?544, on how the prayers for seeing the Merkavah are to be recited: "[there must be] purity and holiness in his heart, and he recites a prayer." 42. On this point see also Swartz, "Book and Tradition." 43. The most thorough treatment of the Sar-Torah texts is in Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot (Tiibingen: Mohr, 1988), pp. 376-386, 427-446; see also Swartz, "HIkf0ldt RabbWti" ??297-306." Halperin places the Sar-Torah at the center of the Hekhalot tradition and assigns it a key place in explaining the origins of the visionary elements in the literature, a view that is not taken in this study. 44. One could call this genre a kind of mnemonic magic. Because memorization was learning in this society, acquiring skill in memory meant progress in the learning of Torah. There is an irony in this, in that many of the rituals involve the memorization of long, impenetrable combinations of magical names and prayers. While mnemonic techniques in rhetorical and esoteric traditions have a well-documented history in classical Roman and medieval European society (on which see F. Yates, The Art of Memoty [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966] and Mary J. Carruthers, The Book of Memory: A Study) of Menmoty in Medieval Culture [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990]), it would be useful to locate similar instances of the application of magic to acquisition of memory in Greco-Roman antiquity. For examples, see Hans Dieter Betz, ed., The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986) 1:9 and 28-31. The place of memory in Rabbinic Judaism and its relationship to magic are discussed in Swartz, Scholastic Magic.</page><page sequence="12">146 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ Related texts concern the cultivation of the so-called Prince of the Presence (Sar-ha-Panimn), who acts as a kind of emissary to the human petitioner, bestowing various benefits and powers on him. Others simply consist of instructions for the recitation of a magical book or name that endows its possessor with wondrous gifts. This is a peculiar genre of magical literature. Most of the texts are set into a highly formalized narrative framework. In these examples, instructions on how to perform the ritual are usually given to the narrator by his teacher, and followed by a story attesting to its success. These passages are obviously composed in such a way as to highlight the ritual and recommend it to the reader. They are thus in some sense ritual texts, but are not purely prescriptive. One of the principal Sar-Torah texts is a complex known as the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah, a story of Rabbi Nehuniah's instruc- tions to Rabbi Ishmael on how to acquire skill in Torah.45 Other passages are found elsewhere in Hekhalot Rabbati and Merkavah Rabbah,46 and in fragments from the Cairo Genizah.47 A unique Aramaic Sar-Torah text in one manuscript of Ma'aseh Merkavah differs considerably from the other Sar-Torah traditions.48 The most prominant Sar ha-Panim text is an elaborate incantation in Merkavah Rabbah which was first published critically and analyzed by Peter Schaifer.49 Manuscripts of Hekhalot literature, like many such medieval compilations of esoteric lore, also include brief incantations 45. A brief version is found in ?278-280 (in Hekhalot Rabbati) and ?677-679 (in Merkavah Rabbah). A longer version appears in ?307-314 of Hekhalot Rabbati. A parallel unit is found in Ma'aseh Merkavah, sec. II (?565-568). See Swartz, Mystical Prayel; pp. 77-90. 46. Hekhalot Rabbati ?297-306 and Merkavah Rabbah ?680-684. 47.

There are also texts in the Cairo Genizah that adjure the Sar-Torah or provide instructions for such adjurations. Some of these are brief fragments which are found on separate leaves, like amulet texts, and many of these appear in magical handbooks. These texts attest to the persistence of the Sar-Torah tradition and to the active use of such rituals. They also lack the narrative framework of the Sar-Torah texts found in the Hekhalot corpus, suggesting that this phenomenon may have evolved independently from Merkavah mysticism and was later incorporated into its literature. There are also incantations in Hekhalot and magical manuscripts for petihat lev, "opening the heart," so that the individual will be successful in study. These are often unrelated to the narrative or angelological Sar-Torah tradition.

Peter Schifer makes a useful distinction between these two goals in the Hekhalot literature." Halperin, in fact, assigns historical and thematic priority to the Sar-Torah literature over the ascent texts." It will be seen that the rituals in the Sar-Torah and adjuration texts reflect a phenomenology common to magical texts, in which the encounter with divine beings can occur only under extraordinary ritual conditions. But it will also be seen that some narratives found in ascent texts, midrashim, and narratives outside of the rabbinic canon depicting the individual's ascent to heaven reflect a similar point of view. These affinities are the result of a common stock of beliefs. The encounter with divine beings can occur on earth or in heaven, according to this conception. However, ritual texts themselves put this conception to active use in their construction of procedures for attracting the angels. Their parallels with midrashic or mystical narratives do not necessarily indicate that the ascent and adjuration texts originated in the same period and social circles, or that one derived directly from the other.53 Principal Features of the Rituals Several types of ritual activities are prevalent in the principal texts. In describing them, it is important to establish a cultural and conceptual framework that makes these texts comprehensible. We therefore must cast our net rather broadly, into a wide range of halakhic, midrashic, and ancient Mediterranean sources. One element common to all of these rituals is the recitation of a set of powerful divine names. It is clear from their structure that the name is 50. ?512 claims that anyone who recites the Divine name presented in the text will be able to revive the dead. ?502-507 is a dream ritual for adjuring the Prince of the Dream (sar shel halom); cf. the talmudic conjuration of the "man of dreams" (ish halom) cited in n. 62 below. A collection of magical recipes appended to the Hekhalot texts in MS Oxf. 1531 includes an incantation for opening a gate (?826-827). finding a slave (?828). and other practical purposes. 51. See Schtifer, "Aim and Purpose," and idem, Hidden and Manifest God. 52. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot; see especially pp. 376-387. 53. The question of the relationship of ascent to adjuration texts in Hekhalot literature must be decided primarily by form-critical criteria and lies outside the scope of this study. The issue is discussed further in Swartz, Scholastic Magic.</page><page sequence="14">148 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ the principal ingredient that gives the rituals their efficacy. Emphasis on the names of God and the angels is also an indispensable characteristic of Jewish magic in general.54 The active ingredient in the Sar-Torah ritual taught by Rabbi Nehuniah to Rabbi Ishmael is a set of names called the "Great Crown." Many isolated paragraphs in the Hekhalot corpus consist of little more than instructions for recitation of a name. One of the most striking such rituals appears in a difficult Aramaic text (?489-495) which identifies itself as a marvelous book containing an all-purpose "Great Name."55 In talmudic tradition the divine name is to be recited and taught under special ritual circumstances. B. Qid. 71 describes the benefits that accrue to anyone who knows and preserves the twelve-letter name in purity.56 So too our rituals, which emphasize the recitation of divine names, are concerned with reciting those names in ritual purity. Fasting and Diet One of the most persistent components of these rituals is the requirement to fast. In most cases the term "fast" refers to partial fasting or special dietary restrictions for a certain period of time. In many texts which prescribe fasts for long periods the reader is then told that he must eat bread baked with his own hands. In some cases a full fast takes place during the daytime only, or for a few days. Common durations of such fasts are forty days and three days. The number forty is no doubt based on Moses' sojourn on Mount Sinai (Exod. 24:18). Likewise, the Israelites were instructed to prepare for three days to receive the Decalogue (Exod. 19:15). The practitioner thus replicates the preconditions for revelation in his reception of the secrets of Torah.57 54. See Joshua Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic, pp. 78-103; Michael D.

A portion of this text has been translated by Gruenwald, "Manichaeism and Judaism," pp. 267-270. The text is notable because it combines many of the principal ritual and rhetorical motifs of the Sar-Torah and allied texts into a coherent whole, although its purpose is not for the cultivation of that particular angel. 56.

Fasts occur for a wide variety of motives in ancient Judaism and its environment." There are fasts of contrition, both statutory and occasional, the most prominent of these being Yom Kippur. Fasting and refraining from several pleasures--including wine, meat, and sexual relations-are ritual signs of mourning.59 There is also evidence in ancient Judaism for fasting for mantic purposes, equivalent to the practice of mantic fasting in the Greco-Roman world described by Rudolph Arbesmann.60 A story in the Palestinian Talmud tells of rabbis who fasted in a graveyard to see Rabbi Hiyya the Great in a dream.61 The Babylonian Talmud (b. Sanh. 65b) discusses those who fast so that an "unclean spirit" may rest on them. Some sources concern individuals who fast to bring down a "man of dreams" (ish halomn), that is, an angel appointed over dreams who answers the dreamer's questions.62 Sar-Torah rituals often specify certain kinds of food that are forbidden. A few such texts advise the practitioner not to eat meat or fish; the magical text quoted above refers to "anything that produces blood." Abstention from meat plays a part in an important source for asceticism in the early rabbinic period, the story of the "mourners of Zion" of the first century who supposedly abstained from meat and wine as a sign of mourning and because of its use in the fallen Temple.63 This story, in which Yohanan ben Zakkai persuades the sect to modify their mourning practices, is usually seen as an example of rabbinic discouragement of asceticism.64 However, it can also be seen as an fast from the new moon of Sivan to Shavuot is prescribed, thus reinforcing the link with Moses' revelation. The relationship of the Sar-Torah literature to midrashim about Moses' ascent has been analyzed extensively in Halperin, Faces of the Chariot. 58. See the articles on asceticism in ancient Judaism cited in n. 5 above. 59. On the meaning of these patterns, see Gary A. Anderson, A Tine to Mourn, a Time to Dance (University Park, Pa.: Penn State Press, 1991). 60. Rudolph Arbesmann, "Fasting and Prophecy in Pagan and Christian Antiquity," Traditio 7 (1949): 9-32; cf.

SWARTZ indicator of the range of foods and actions considered to be luxurious and thus inappropriate.65 An interesting use of the motif of the ritual fast is found in Version B of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah. In this story, Rabbi Ishmael, who is thirteen years old, is in great affliction because of his inability to retain his learning. He tries to remedy the situation on his own: "When I saw that my learning was not remaining with me, I stood and refrained (tafasti asmi) from eating, drinking, washing, anointing, and sexual activity, and no word of song or melody passed from my mouth" (?308). Rabbi Ishmael's practice is reminiscent of old mourning rituals and penitential and petitionary rituals for Yom Kippur and times of drought.66 This cluster of activities constitutes signs of joy that are restricted in times of crisis or mourning.67 Rabbi Ishmael's fast is thus a sign of his contrition and grief. Rabbi Nehuniah then rescues him by taking him from his father's house to the Temple and having him adjure by the Great Seal, a magical name. This name accomplishes the task, and is subsequently recommended to the reader. It is therefore an effective substitute for Rabbi Ishmael's fast. However, in a similar story that appears a few paragraphs below,68 young Rabbi Ishmael has been fasting for forty days for the same purpose. He manages to bring down Yofiel, the Angel of the Presence, who proceeds to question his motives. After being assured that Rabbi Ishmael conjured him for the sake of heaven,69 the angel instructs him in the correct procedure: "Whoever wants it to be revealed to him7" must sit fasting for forty days, perform twenty-four immersions every day, and not eat anything defiling. He must not look at a woman, and must sit in a totally dark house" (?314). Whereas the behavior described here is similar to Rabbi Ishmael's above, 65. Cf. Anderson, A Time to Mourn, pp. 112-114, which stresses the relevance of this pattern for communal mourning rituals. 66. Cf. the list in m. Yoma 8:1. 67. Anderson, A Time To Mourtn, pp. 112-114.

This clause is in Aramaic.</page><page sequence="17">RITUAL AND PURITY IN EARLY JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MAGIC 151 the emphasis has shifted from the patterns of mourning to Rabbi Ishmael's physical purity. One intriguing detail which appears in several of these texts is the prohibition of certain kinds of vegetables. The Sar-Torah texts in Merkavah Rabbah and Hekhalot Rabbati tell the mystic to avoid vegetables of every kind. The incantation for the Great Name instructs, "and he shall not eat onion, garlic, or garden vegetables";" so too the magical manual quoted above. The exact reason for these prohibitions is unclear. One possibility may reside in their susceptibility to ritual impurity. Unlike Daniel's beans, "wet" foods can contract impurity more easily.72 Arbesmann notes the custom of "xerophagy" among the Montanists, who, according to Tertullian, refrained from meat, wine, succulent fruit, and anything juicy.73 If the authors advised avoidance of luxuries like meat and wine, they may also have remembered the onions and garlic which tempted the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai (Num. 11:5).74 Another reason may be that these foods may cause indigestion and bodily odors.7 Alongside of these prohibitions are instructions about what to eat. Here too a pattern of avoidance is reflected. Persistent in the instructions is the injunction that the practitioner should "eat bread of his own hands."76 More specifically, he should not eat bread baked by a woman.77 This detail is part of a larger emphasis on avoiding any trace of menstrual impurity, and can be placed with other such precautions. The Sar-Torah ritual in section II of Ma'aseh Merkavah contains an instruction to "eat one's bread with salt."'78 The same phrase appears in an appendix to m. Avot (Avot 6:4) to exemplify the sage's simple life.79 71. ?489. 72. The Mishnah tractate Makhshirim, based on Lev. 11:34 and 38, is built on this assumption; on foods which are under presumption of impurity, see chap. 6 of that tractate. 73.

Gruenwald cites sources that maintain that vegetables compromise one's health and notes that Mani and the Elchasaites refrained from certain kinds of vegetables. Garlic was also seen as an aphrodisiac throughout the Mediterranean, and it may have been avoided in these rituals because it would encourage seminal emiscion.

SWARTZ The Aramaic Sar-Torah text in Ma'aseh Merkavah (?571-578) involves an unusual ritual of eating and drinking. The practitioner is instructed to make a certain kind of "cooked bread"80 and go down to the river. He then performs a ritual involving writing magical names on leaves and a silver cup, dissolving them in wine, and drinking the wine. This stands in contrast to the prohibition of wine in other Sar-Torah rituals. However, several magical texts include incantations to be recited over wine.8A One detail provides a clue to some of these specific dietary prohibitions. In the course of a ritual for the Sar-Torah to be practiced supposedly by a disciple of the sages (talmid hakhamn), the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah prohibits what it calls "any thing filthy" (kol davar mezoham).82 One might ask, as Halperin has done, what kind of advanced rabbinical student would eat unclean or defiling foods.83 One possible answer to this question is that the term mezolham or zohama probably does not refer to foods that are forbidden to all Jews according to Leviticus 11 and related rabbinic laws (i.e., not "kosher"), but foods that are dirty or have a foul odor.84 As we shall see, these rituals often seek to avoid odors. Another possibility is that it refers to impure foods, or at least foods that do not match the peculiar criteria for purity found in these texts. Foods which are not forbidden but are 'contaminated with ritual impurity may be eaten by lay Israelites, and appears at the end of that tractate as well as in extracanonical tractates. See M. B. Lerner, "The Tractate Avot," in Shmuel Safrai, ed., The Literature of the Sages (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), 1:273-275. 80. Aram. dwd' rypt', which might be translated as "pot bread," or "boiled bread." This translation is uncertain.

Even if, in the fictional setting of this story, the Temple Mount, Rabbi Nehuniah and Rabbi Ishmael would have had to eat their food in purity, it could not have been taken for granted that the reader would need to do so--especially if, as is plausible, he lived in the diaspora.85 Sexual Purity and Social Avoidance Concern with sexual purity is an essential element of these rituals. This concern is manifest in two related ways: the prohibition of sexual activity and seminal emission,86 and a deep concern with menstrual purity. Here too, the injunction at Sinai not to go near a woman (Exod. 19:15) provides a precedent for the individual's encounter with the Sar-Torah. Although m. Ber. 3:4 prohibits a man who has had a seminal emission from reciting the blessing over the Shenia', the parallel in Tosefta explicitly permits other categories of impure persons to study.87 However, as Shaye Cohen observes, although the restrictions on the ejaculant in the synagogue are older and more authentic within the rabbinic system,88 they were largely ignored in many Jewish communities in favor of unauthorized popular restrictions on menstruants.89 85. Cf., however, b. Nid. 20b and 52b, where zhm is clearly distinguished from menstrual impurity. For evidence of the Sar-Torah practice in the diaspora, see ?305. 86. The reader is sometimes instructed that if an emission occurs, he must bathe and repeat the entire regimen from the first day, as the resulting pollution has invalidated the entire preparation. See ?684 and ?489. 87. T. Ber. 2:12-13. See Saul Lieberman, Tosefta ki-Feshutah, Zera'in, vol. 1, p. 20. 88. Cf. however the Babylonian Talmud's discussion of this passage in b. Ber. 22a, in which the leniency of the rabbis regarding purification from seminal impurity is framed in terms of its consequences for Torah study and sexual activity. Here the rabbis' basic concern for the purity of the man studying Torah is offset by their consideration of how this leniency would affect his performance of the misvah of procreation, according to one opinion, or whether it would lead to promiscuity, according to another. This discussion, in effect, thus minimizes the importance of purity itself. 89. Shaye J. D.

SWARTZ The concern with menstrual purity, niddah, forms the basis for some of the most historically significant details in this literature. The requirement mentioned above that the practitioner eat "bread of his own hands" serves two allied purposes. It allows him to maintain his isolation, which is an important component of the ritual.90 It also ensures that he will not come into contact with menstrual impurity. In fact, in parallel texts the injunction to eat lehem yadav, "bread of his own hands," alternates in the versions with the prohibition of lehiem ishah, "bread of a woman." The intricacies of rabbinic and non-rabbinic laws and customs of niddah also play a part in the primary ritual text in the ascent traditions, the deposition of Rabbi Nehuniah from heaven, which is examined below. The isolation of the individual is reinforced in a general way. According to the Sar-Torah text in Hekhalot Rabbati (?299), the practitioner must sleep alone for twelve days in a room or attic. In one version of the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah (?314), he is to sit in a dark house. Some texts prohibit looking at women or other people. In one case Rabbi Ishmael is to keep his eyes down and does not even look at colored material.91 A Genizah fragment stipulates: He goes and sits in a house by himself, and he should be in fasting all day and does not eat bread of a woman and does not look either at a man or a woman. And when he walks in the marketplace he averts his eyes from all creatures and does not look even at a one-day-old child.92 The Aramaic incantation for the Great Name instructs: He must not see the face of a male or female twin, nor see the face of a male ve-ha-Minut Esel ha-Rambam u-Veno R.

(?489) This passage lists, for the most part, classes of persons who are unclean according to biblical law. Lepers, those who have an abnormal flux (zov), and menstruants are all impure according to Lev. 13-15.91 The taboo on twins, however, is a mysterious detail. Research thus far has turned up no such taboo in classical Judaism. Indeed, b. Yeb. 98a states that twins are simply the result of the splitting of a drop of semen, and therefore, presumably, an explainable and natural phenomenon. It is possible that this statement was intended to refute a folk-belief to the opposite effect--one which is reflected in our text. Another possibility is raised by I. Gruenwald's observation that according to Song of Songs Rabbah and parallels, twins are susceptible to each other's diseases.96 Thus, the twin you meet in the market may have come down with some contamination from his or her brother or sister miles away.97 More significant for our purposes is that according to the halakhah one does not contract impurity merely by looking at a person who is impure in these ways. These prohibitions, then, not only go beyond the halakhic norm, but reflect concepts at odds with the rabbinic purity system. However, the authors are not oblivious to that system; nor are these practices merely an eccentric hyperextension of normative purity rituals thought up by an individual. There is evidence that other Jews in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages also considered pollution to be something that could occur 93. Sgyr' and sgyrt'. The term sgyr derives from the meaning of the root sgr as "quaran- tined," as in the procedure for lepers according to Lev. 13:46. Cf. t. Neg. 6:1. 94.

Gruenwald, takes the prohibition to mean that the individual is prohibited from looking at his own twin. However, this reading is not supported by the text, which affixes no possessive pronouns to the words rywi' and tvwimt'. Another clue to this prohibition may be found in b. Pes. 110-113, which discusses the practice of avoiding pairs when eating, drinking, and attending to one's bodily needs; doing these in pairs is said to make one vulnerable to demons. However, there is no suggestion there that the taboo would be extended to the avoidance of human pairs.</page><page sequence="22">156 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ even through the most casual contact with the contaminated person-in this case the menstruant. A curious text known as Braita de-Massekhet Niddah, which purports to relate extra-talmudic statements of the sages regarding menstruation, claims that niddah can be transmitted through the earth on which the menstruant walks and even through her speech or breath.98 A medieval legend illustrates the notion that looking at an impure creature is enough to contaminate or harm a person. This text is a miraculous birth narrative about Rabbi Ishmael, the hero of the Hekhalot literature.99 In this tale, Ishmael's saintly mother and father are distressed because she has not borne a child that survived. The couple decide that she must immerse in a ritual bath before they conceive. Then: "she immersed, and she encountered a pig. She returned to the bathhouse and immersed. When she emerged, she saw a leper before her. She went back and immersed.""' After forty such instances, the Holy One, blessed be He, instructs Gabriel to tell her that she has more than proven her piety (in fact, that she has gone too far) and that she will be rewarded with little Ishmael. According to halakhah, contact with a live pig does not produce impurity; nor, as we have seen, does the mere sight of anything defiling. But there are numerous examples of the belief that looking at a particular kind of animal or person--especially a menstruating woman--can affect one physically.'0' B.

Rather, both genres reflect popular notions that each uses to its purpose. Ablutions and Cleansing Ablutions accompany the regimen at some point in the rituals. These are explicitly designated as purificatory rituals. ?299 instructs the reader to "wash his garments and cloaks and perform a stringent immersion rendering him free from any doubt of nocturnal pollution." Note here the requirement to wash one's clothes, which was also commanded at Sinai in Exod. 19:10 and 14. In the Great Name ritual (?489) the practitioner must wear white garments; in the Sar-Torah ritual in Ma'aseh Merkavah (?560) he is not to look at colored fabric. In a few texts the ablution is to take place at a river."10 As Gruenwald and Moshe Idel have pointed out, the river was known as a place of numinous encounter for Ezekiel and Jacob, and as the setting for many magical procedures.1' With the Angels What is at stake in these elaborate procedures?

In contrast, the purpose of the versions quoted by Horowitz is to demonstrate the merits of ritual immersion, which removes those harmful effects.

SWARTZ being undergo such an extraordinary level of purification in order to meet with the angels? We may locate a clue to this question in another set of texts relevant to our understanding of the role of purity in these rituals: rabbinic legends regarding rivalry between humans and angels, particularly those that concern Moses' ascent to heaven to receive the Torah.o10 It is open to question whether the Moses stories constituted the sole, or even the principal source for the Sar-Torah genre and the Hekhalot tradition in general.106 But many details of the Moses stories are relevant to a discussion of purity and askesis in those literatures. The locus classicus for the ascent of Moses is in the Babylonian Talmud, b. Shab. 88b-89a. Important versions of this myth are also found in early medieval midrashim, such as Pesiqta Rabbati.107 In the talmudic version, the angels protest to God about Moses's presence among them to receive the Torah, asking, "What is one born of woman doing here among us?" In Pesiqta Rabbati chapter 20, an angel accuses Moses directly: "You have come from a place of filth to a pure place; You born of woman, what are you doing in a place of fire?"'"0 The angels' disparagement of Moses as one "born of woman" reminds him of his origins in impurity according to Leviticus 12.'09 In the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah, the angel Yofiel, rebuking Rabbi Ishmael, addresses him 105.

A particularly offensive property of human beings is their smell. In one passage, Metatron disturbs the heavenly hosts, who demand to know why the smell of this being "born of woman" is rising up to them."' This unit is a brief tradition appended to Hekhalot Rabbati at ? 147-149 in one manuscript and to the Chapter of Rabbi Nehuniah at ?315-317 in another.113 It is probably a late tradition and may reflect the idea, which forms the basis for the narrative of 3 Enoch, that Metatron was once the earthling Enoch. Ablutions in the Sar-Torah rituals may therefore have the purpose not only of ridding the practitioner of ritual impurity, but of odors; so too the prohibitions of garlic and other foods that may cause bad breath and indigestion.14 But in these cases, the angels are not simply expressing contempt at the physical obnoxiousness of the human intruder; they are apparently concerned that he will pollute the angelic domain. Thus extraordinary purification is necessary to approach their abode in heaven. In the same way, the individual who seeks to bring the angel to earth must not repulse him with his impurity. These midrashim depict Moses as undergoing a process of extraordinary purification in preparation for the revelation at Sinai. In b. Yoma 4a, Rabbi below.

SWARTZ Natan interprets Exodus 24:16 to mean that the cloud covered Moses at Sinai in order to purge food and drink from his bowels "to make him like the ministering angels.""'1 It is a matter of debate, in b. Yoma 75b, for example, whether or not angels eat.116 Visitors likewise do not eat, but, like Moses and Aaron according to b. Ber. 17a, are "nourished by the splendor of the Shekhinah.""'17 In some sources the angels (and humans in their presence) eat a particular kind of heavenly food."8 This idea may bear on the special preparations of bread found in some of our rituals. The notion that in order to be among the divine beings it is necessary to assume a state of ritual parity with them is an ancient idea which finds expression in this midrash and in the Hekhalot literature. According to Gary A. Anderson, Gilgamesh's friend Enkidu would be able to walk about in the netherworld unnoticed if he refrained from the joyous activities-like those proscribed in rabbinic literature on mourning and atonement-which distin- guish the living."'19 This would appear to be behind the necromantic fasting of the rabbis mentioned above. Likewise, in order to be indistinguishable from the angels, Moses must be empty of food. In Ma'aseh Merkavah, the ruse works too well. The Sar-Torah practitioner must protect himself by standing in a circle so that "the demons will not come and liken him to the angels and kill him" (?562).120 Moses wins the argument with the angels by citing the very physicality of humanity which was the grounds for their objections in the first place. That physicality is what permits human beings to observe the Torah. In b. Shab. 88b he points out: "It is written, 'honor your father and mother' [Exod. 20:12 and Deut. 5:16]; do you have mothers and fathers?" This argument can be seen as a clever refutation of the epithet yelud ishah, "born of woman." In 115. This view is opposed by Mattiah ben Heresh. See also Avot de-Rabbi Natan, ed.

Rather, they can merely afford to be more fastidious. A particularly striking passage in a cosmological text, Seder Rabbah de-Bereshit, illustrates the idea that the angels themselves are not exempt from the ritual dynamics that allow the human practitioner to be in their presence.'12 This passage describes the protocol of the heavenly liturgy, and particularly its dependence on the earthly liturgy of Israel."' The heavenly chorus must wait for Israel on earth to recite the Qedushah (Isa. 6:3) before they can recite theirs. How do they know when Israel has done so on earth? There is an angel named Shemu'el who stands every day at dawn and announces the prayers that rise from the synagogues and houses of study. When he does so, the angels immerse themselves in rivers of fire. At this point the text asks a perfectly reasonable question: (?181) And do the angels have flux [zov] and pollution, menstrual impurity [niddah], and [impurity of] childbirth, that they require immersion? Rather, [those who immerse are] the angels who are appointed over the labor of the world and descend every day to bring peace to the world-when the time comes for song, they go up to the firmament and because of the smell of human beings who are born of woman, possessors of impurity, possessors of flux and filth, they bathe themselves in fire and cleanse and purify and lustrate . . . themselves in fire until they make themselves holy, and they become like the ministering angels of the upper firmament ['arevot raqia']. The susceptibity to pollution on the part of the angels is not merely an esoteric notion, confined to the phenomenological fringes of Jewish religious history. It is an echo of a significant aspect of biblical cultic theology: the volatility of the divine presence in biblical religion. As described by Baruch 121. Midrash Tehillim (ed. Buber), chap. 8, pp. 74-75. See also Schultz, "Angelic Opposi- tion," pp. 286-287, 300-301. 122. Synopse ?790-791, MS Oxf. 1531 and ?810-811 in the same manuscript (= ?180-181 in MS NY 8128). 123. On the correspondence between the heavenly and earthly liturgies, see Swartz, Mystical Prayer; Schafer, "Aim and Purpose"; and Gruenwald, "Angelic Songs, the Qedushah and the Problem of the Origin of the Hekhalot Literature," in Apocalyptism, pp. 145-173.</page><page sequence="28">162 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ A. Levine, the Potent Presence of God required extremely delicate sanitary conditions to appear on earth; if these conditions were not met, the Deity had no choice but to react."24 It is this volatility which triggers the divine wrath against misguided intruders like Nadab and Abihu in Lev. 10:1-2. As Moses' subsequent consolation of Aaron demonstrates (Lev. 10:3), that wrath is less an emotional response to sin than a manifestation of God's holiness.'25 It is in this context that we can understand a common motif in both the conjuration and ascent literatures: the wrath of the angels. We can see this motif in the Sar-Torah's rebuke of Rabbi Ishmael, but it manifests itself in the ritual itself. Repeatedly, the practitioner adjures the angels not to harm him.126 The motif of the danger of the encounter with the divine beings determines much of the ritual dynamics manifest in these texts. The angels personify the impersonal wrath of the Potent Presence in reaction to invasion of its pure realm. The Deposition of Rabbi Nehuniah The ascent to the heavens and esoteric system of ritual purity are placed in striking conjunction in the story of Rabbi Nehuniah's deposition from heaven in Hekhalot Rabbati (?225-228). This passage, which has prompted consid- erable discussion in recent years, is the principal source for understanding the relationship of cultic purity to the idea of ascent to the Merkavah.'27 The setting of the story is the Temple in Jerusalem. Rabbi Nehuniah is seated, reciting the details of his ascent in the midst of his disciples. In order to ask their rabbi about a cryptic term he is using, his colleagues must bring him down from heaven. However, they must do so without causing him harm 124. Baruch A.

They thus employ an elaborate procedure in which a piece of fine cloth is touched by a woman who has completed her cycle, has immersed unsuccessfully, once, and has then immersed correctly.'"2 This woman would be impure only according to one of the sages. The cloth is placed on a bough of myrtle soaked in balsam oil and placed on Rabbi Nehluniah's knees. This has the effect of deposing him from before the heavenly throne. For Scholem, this story was proof of "the halakhic character of Hekhalot mysticism" and thus of its derivation from rabbinic circles.'29 It is the passage in Hekhalot literature which bears the strongest affinities to rabbinic halakhah. However, it is more purely a narrative text than the prescriptive texts in our selection that concern a ritual undertaken by a rabbi.13" The procedure-indeed Rabbi Nelhuniah's entire ascent-is presented by the narrative as a one-time occurrence undertaken in an emergency."' The basic objective of the procedure is to render Rabbi NeIhuniah impure so that he will be cast down from heaven. Each of the steps taken have as their purpose the infusion of the cloth with a marginal degree of impurity. The woman is at a stage in her cycle, after she has immersed a first time, in which her purity is probable but not certain. Rabbi Nehluniah would then be made impure only in the opinion of a minority of sages."32 But, as Lieberman points out, in heaven the minority view with regard to purity prevails."33 The colleagues' solution was particularly ingenious, for it allowed them to bring him down without violating his earthly purity on the Temple Mount. Thus 128. In b. Nid. 67a, the term lo 'altah lah tevilah refers to an immersion invalidated by an interposing substance. See Schiffman, "Rabbi Nehunia," p. 274; Lieberman, "Knowledge of Halakha," p. 243. 129. Jewish Gnosticism, p. 9. 130. Unlike many of the ritual texts under discussion, this one does not contain a rec- ommendation for the praxis in which the tradent or an angel testifies to its effectiveness for everybody regardless of status. Such a recommendation occurs, for example, in ?305, in which the narrative stresses that the Sar-Torah praxis is effective for the lowliest shepherd and is as potent outside of the land of Israel as within its boundaries. 131. The ascent is also undertaken because of an emergency: Rome's evil decree against Israel. Furthermore, SchlUter's textual analysis ("Erzihlung," pp. 84-95) shows that the account of Rabbi Nehuniah's deposition is a later addition to this section of Hekhalot Rabbati. 132. Lieberman, "Knowledge of Halakha," p. 242, suggests that the minority would include Rabbi Eliezer, who was known to take a stricter position on purity. 133. Ibid. The myrtle branch dipped in balsam would serve to disguise the odor of the cloth according to Lieberman, or, in Schiffman's view, act as a magic wand that would likewise affect the deposition and reinforce the action.</page><page sequence="30">164 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ interpreted, this procedure underscores the cultic dynamics of the ascent as conceived by the authors of Hekhalot Rabbati: there are higher standards of ritual purity in heaven, but the function of purity is the same as in the biblical cult. Purity is a prerequisite for approaching the Potent Presence of God. Notwithstanding the story's obvious halakhic dimension, there are factors militating against the argument that it proves that the authors of the Hekhalot literature were the same rabbis responsible for the classical Talmuds and midrashim. One is that the halakhah is one component but not the sole component of the ritual. As Schiffman and Schltiter point out, there is a significant magical dimension to the praxis.'31 Moreover, the halakhah on which they do rely is nonstandard. As Schliiter observes, the position of its authors is extrahalakhic.135 In fact, according to current scholarship on the subject, the Pharisaic and rabbinic purity systems deemphasized the cultic and localized nature of the biblical concept of purity."36 In the early rabbinic system, purity was no longer the sole property of those who needed to approach the Divine Presence in the Temple, but a duty of all Israel. This story, by contrast, reinforces the cultic notion. The Presence is not, however, localized on Zion, but in the heavenly Temple.'37 Conclusions Ritual and Inner Experience Rituals in the Hekhalot literature have largely been interpreted according to the assumption that their principal meaning can be found in the intention 134. Schiffman, "Recall," pp. 275-281; SchliUter, "ErzAhlung," p. 107. 135. Schltter, "Erzihlung," pp. 108-109. It is also possible that this episode, which seems to have been interpolated into the ascent narrative of Hekhalot Rabbati, reflects a later stage in the tradition's development in which the influence of rabbinic halakhah was greater. If this is the case, its halakhic nature does not argue for the rabbinic origin of Merkavah mysticism. 136. See especially Neusner, Purities; idem, The Idea of Purity, and Baruch M. Bokser, "Approaching Sacred Space," Harvard Theological Review 78 (1985): 279-299. 137. To be sure, many passages in rabbinic literature can be found that do reflect this older concept. See for example, Avot de-Rabbi Natan,, chap. 34 and A. Aptowitzer, "Bet ha-Miqdash shel Ma'alah 'al Pi ha-Aggadah," Tarbis 2 (1931): 137-153 and 257-287.

It is certainly not difficult to imagine that the individual who follows these procedures might achieve a vision of the angel he wishes to conjure, or of the heavenly array. But if we make this idea the primary vehicle for interpreting these practices, we miss much of their significance. This analysis has shown that rituals in the Hekhalot literature reflect distinct ritual goals and can be read within the context of the traditional and mythic worlds of their time. As the Sar-Torah practitioner sees it, he must prepare for an encounter with divine beings who are sensitive to terrestrial pollution and are easily provoked. Taking as his initial model his ancestors' approach to the Divine Presence at Sinai and Zion, he then seeks to rid himself of all physical traces of his humanness through ritual purification, using techniques drawn from halakhah, Jewish folk beliefs, and perhaps Greco-Roman magic. The foregoing analysis suggests that it is this conception, no less than the consciousness of the individual, that influences the details of these ritual procedures. Social Implications Lieberman and Schltiter interpreted the story of Rabbi Nehuniah's depo- sition with the aid of Braita de-Massekhet Niddah, mentioned above. This document has had an unusual history. Its deviation from rabbinic halakhah goes well beyond its extraordinary strictness with regard to menstrual purity; its teachings fly in the face of clear rabbinic dicta."38 Braita de-Massekhet Niddah reflects folk beliefs and practices regarding the impurity of women which persisted from the talmudic period well into the Middle Ages. Two customs, the removal of the menstruant from the house and the refusal to permit her to enter the synagogue, were entrenched among the laity in many communities, despite the repeated denunciations of these practices by the rabbinic leadership."39 In Braita de-Massekhet Niddah, these customs are based on the ideas cited above that the menstruant's speech or breath itself is 138. See Dinari, "Minhage Tum'at ha-Niddah," pp. 304-305. Indeed, the book seems at times to be a pallid imitation, if not an outright parody, of mishnaic literature. The text cites "Haninah ben ha-Qannah" (for Nehuniah ben ha-Qannah) and opens with the words, "Shammai says . . ." which also begin m. Nid. This led Schechter ("Jewish Literature," p. 339) to propose that the sources of the text can be found among Karaites or Samaritans. This view has been refuted by Dinari, "Minhage Tum'at ha-Niddah"; cf. Lieberman, Sheqi'in, p. 22. 139. These customs can thus take their place with folk practices such as kapparot, tashlikh, and other extrahalakhic rituals. On these folk rituals, see the studies collected in Jacob</page><page sequence="32">166 MICHAEL D. SWARTZ polluting and that the earth she walks on is impure. Such notions also inform the ritual prohibitions we find in the Hekhalot literature. These texts reflect practices found in Jewish popular religion of the talmudic period.'14 However, the implications of the extrahalakhic dimension of these rituals for their relationship to Rabbinic Judaism are complex. They do not lead unambiguously to the conclusion that the Sar-Torah literature originated in the lower classes of Jewish society.'4' Its ambivalent position in relation to halakhah and its use of the idea of Torah for the specific ends of the magic point to an origin in groups outside the central circles of rabbinic learning who at the same time were literate and acquainted with midrashic lore, liturgical poetry, and elements of rabbinic law. 42 For this literature appropriates rabbinic values in peculiar ways. Its authors invoke the authority of the early rabbis to promote their magical recipes.'14 These recipes, in fact, offer nothing less than shortcuts to success in the very endeavor most valued by the rabbinic estate-the study of Torah.

Long points out ("Popular Religion," Encyclopedia of Religion 11:440-452), the term popular religion can have several meanings, not all of them useful for describing the religious phenomena described here. One of these possible definitions (p. 446) approximates the relevance of the term for this study: "Popular religion as an amalgam of esoteric beliefs and practices differing from the common or civil religion, but usually located in the lower strata of society." This definition is useful to us notwithstanding the degree of education our authors seem to have had. Halperin, Faces of the Chariot, seeks to locate the authors in the lower classes ('amn ha-ares) and argues that the Hekhalot literature constituted a protest against Rabbinic Judaism. This study thus confirms the opinion of Halperin and others, who argue that these texts did not originate in the rabbinic academies, and that the Sar-Torah tradition's notion of the acquisition of Torah should be contrasted with that of Rabbinic Judaism.

If he eats at all, he must eat a severely restricted diet which he himself prepares. He immerses frequently and sometimes wears special clothes. To the naked eye, he looks like a monk. Indeed, the monastic ideals of "living like angels" and the "war against the demons" can also be seen as magical ideals.'44 So too, in both cases, if the problem they wish to address-the humanness of the adept-is physical, the remedy is likewise physical. The human creature is a son of a stinking drop, born in impurity, who eats and excretes-in other words, a physically obnoxious being who has no right to keep company with the angels. Without the elaborate ritual procedures and routines such as those we use to identify ascetics, the angels would never descend. In mapping the complex network of diets, prohibitions, exclusions, sexual taboos, and ablutions, we come up against the physicality of asceticism. From Deuteronomy 30:12 we learn that the Torah is not in heaven. For those ancient Jews who dreamed of conjuring them, living with the angels was not a permanent state of life but an extraordinary event whose importance lay in the heaven-sent capacity to acquire knowledge of a Torah brought down to earth.

The ideal of virginity, however, plays no part in the Jewish patterns of abstinence described here.
