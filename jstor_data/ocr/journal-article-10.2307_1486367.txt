<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURE AND EDITING IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM by NORMAN J. COHEN Since Leopold Zunz's comments regarding the highly artistic form of the classic rabbinic homily,' those involved in the critical study of midrash have concerned themselves with the structure of the derashah. Some nineteenth and early twentieth century scholars recognized that the individual pisqa'ot and parashiyyot of the homiletic midrashim contain a series of petihtot (ser- monic proems),2 followed by interpretative comments upon the first few verses of the pericope texts.3 In addition, research into homiletic forms such 1.

It should be noted that simple proems are found as well as in Genesis Rabbah, which is basically an exegetic midrash. 3. For example, see Julius Theodor, "Zur Composition der aggadischen Homilien," 1</page><page sequence="2">2 NORMAN J. COHEN as the peroration led other scholars closer to an understanding of the struc- tural unity of the rabbinic homily.4 It is not until the work of Joseph Heinemann, however, that we encounter a real attempt at analyzing the overall structure as well as the degree of editing of the derashah.5 Heinemann contended that the compiler or redactor of Leviticus Rabbah originated the literary homily (ha-derashah ha-sifrutit) which had a tripartite form: proems, body (exegesis of the first verses of the pericope text) and messianic peroration. He selected material from traditions already shaped into units, some of which might have been parts of actual sermons, and he, in turn, fit these units into the fixed homi- letic structure.6 In passing, Heinemann noted that the body of the homily did not possess a standardized form. Though his research focused upon Leviticus Rabbah, Heinemann saw his conclusions as applying also to the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, another early homiletic compilation,7 as well as to the later Yelammedenu-TanhIuma midrashim." Abraham Goldberg went even further than Heinemann in underscoring the highly structured nature of the pisqa'ot in the early homiletic midrashim. He maintained that over and above its fixed tripartite form, the body of the rabbinic homily has a predictable structure. It is made up of thematic interpretations followed by exegetic comments upon the pericope text.9 Monatsschrift far die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums 29 (1879): 108; Maybaum, Die altesten Phasen, passim; and Bloch, "Studien zur Aggadah," passim. 4.

Heinemann, "'Omanut," p. 809, n. 1. The Yelammedenu-Tanbuma midrashim, which include the Pesiqta Rabbati, Midrash Tanbuma ha-Nidpas, Midrash Tanbuma Buber and Deuteronomy Rabbah, are dated from the end of the sixth-early seventh centuries and later. They characteristically begin with a halakhic proem, which has the opening proemial text replaced by a rhetorical question/answer generally of a legal nature, followed by a regular proem, sometimes attributed to R. Tanbuma [b. Abba]. 9. Abraham Goldberg, Review of Mandelbaum's edition of the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, Kiryat Sefer 43 (1967): 79.

In undertaking such a project, there is one major difficulty: the ability to distinguish between comments upon the pericope texts which are thoroughly expositional in nature and those which are thematic. Fre- quently, expositional comments include within them thematic, narrative material, which leads to a blurring of form. I Structure in the Homiletic Midrashim Our research corroborates that Abraham Goldberg correctly empha- sized the highly fixed structure of the homilies found in both Leviticus Rabbah and the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. Not only do we find a fixed over- all form in which proems precede interpretation of the pericope text in most homilies, but, within the body of the derashot, thematic comments generally appear before straight exegesis. The structure of these units seems to be even more rigid than Joseph Heinemann's portrait of the literary homily.

These follow the regular proems in Goldberg's estimation [see his comments in his article, "Ha-Munab 'Gufah' be-Midrash Va-Yiqra Rabbah," Leshonenu 38 (1974): 164]. In both cases, however, the fixed structure of the derashah is clear: regular proems, thematic comments and then exegesis on the first few verses of the pericope text. 10. Parashah 25 (Qedoshim 2) is made up of only a string of proems. 11. This number does not include the seven pisqa'ot designated as nispabim (appendices) in</page><page sequence="4">4 NORMAN J. COHEN Of the parashiyyot of LR which have both proems and pericope com- ments (thematic, exegetic or both), over 83 percent have a fixed order (30 of 36) in which all the proems precede the pericope comments.'2 Additionally, of the 23 parashiyyot which contain a diversity of material in the body of the homily (both thematic and exegetic comments on the pericope text), 16 pre- sent all the thematic material prior to the exegesis (almost 70 percent). In comparison, 93 percent of the pisqa'ot in PRK exhibit an overall fixed order of proems and pericope comments. In only 2 of the 28 units analyzed do we find proems placed throughout the homily.'3 This is an even greater degree of fixed order than was encountered in LR. A slightly smaller per- centage (60 percent) of homilies in PRK which contain both thematic and exegetic comments upon the pericope text (19) have a fixed order of these elements (11).

Not only do the thematic and exegetic comments generally not follow any set order, but proems are interwoven with expositional comments throughout the homily. As a clear illustration of the contrast between the early homiletic mid- rashim and some of their later counterparts with respect to the structure of the homily, we first turn our attention to Midrash Pesiqta Rabbati which contains both Yelammedenu-Tanh.uma homilies and pisqa'ot drawn from PRK.'7 Of the 10 PRK-type homilies, only one, pisqa 51, does not main- tain a fixed ordering of proems and pericope comments. In addition, in 9 of the 10 homilies, thematic expositions precede exegetic comments upon the pericope text.'" In comparison, of the 25 Yelammedenu-Tanhuma derashot found in PR which have both proems and pericope comments, only 11 have a fixed order. 56 percent of these homilies show a flexibility of overall struc- ture. Additionally, unlike the PRK homilies, there is no necessary order among the pericope comments in these Yelammedenu-TanIhuma homilies. In almost all of the homilies (12 of 15) which have both thematic expositions and pericope exegesis, these structural entities are mixed.19 The flexibility of form in the Yelammedenu-Tanhuma homilies is not unique to Pesiqta Rabbati. The derashot in both versions of Midrash Tan- huma, Tanhuma ha-Nidpas and Tanhuma Buber reveal a similar degree of mixture of formal elements. Of all the units in Tanluma ha-Nidpas which have both proems and pericope comments and potentially can be considered "literary homilies" according to the description of Joseph Heinemann, approximately 38 percent (43 of 114) show flexibility of form (proems and 17. The ten PRK parallels include pisqa'ot 14-18 (PRK 4-8), 29/30A,B (PRK 16), 32 (PRK 18), and 51-52 (PRK 27-28) according to the enumeration in William Braude's translation, Pesikta Rabbati: Discourses for Feasts, Fasts and Special Sabbaths, 3 vols. (New Haven, 1968). In some cases, the material in PR and the PRK is virtually identical. It is quite probable that the compiler of PR, or perhaps even a later copyist, found Yelammedenu-Tanbuma pisqa'ot missing from the work and was forced to fill in the lacunae from parallel pisqa'ot drawn from the earlier Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. The existence of additional Yelammedenu-Tanbuma homilies (pisqa'ot 48 and 49) for Passover indicates that the Rabbati originally contained different pisqa'ot for some holidays, but these were lost and had to be replaced. 18. The only exception is pisqa 17 (Va- Yehi ba-basi ha-lailah), which is one of the reasons why Abraham Goldberg concluded that this homily was not original to the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. See his comments in his article, "Li-Meqoriyyutan shel ha-pisqa'ot 'Va-Yehi ba-basi ha-lailah' ve-'Shor o Kesev,"' Tarbiz 38 (1969): 184-85. 19.

COHEN pericope comments are interwoven).20 In passing, it should be noted that the breakdown in the formal structure of the homily does not merely involve the mixing of proems and pericope comments, but in some units halakhic proems do not even appear as the first elements.2 Thematic and exegetic comments are intermeshed as well. Of the 38 units which contain both types of material, only 17 have thematic comments preceding the exegesis of the pericope texts. Analysis of 11 sample parashiyyot from Tanbuma Buber yields similar results.22 Out of a total of 27 units which contain both proems and pericope comments, 13 possess a flexible ordering (48 percent). 15 units contain halakhic proems, and of these, 7 do not have a fixed order of struc- tural elements. In addition, of the 12 units which contain thematic com- ments as well as pericope exegesis, only 5 maintain a fixed ordering of these elements. Of all the midrashic compilations with a sizable number of homilies con- taining halakhic proems,23 only Deuteronomy Rabbah does not have a high percentage of homilies with a flexible ordering of formal elements.24 All but one of the 25 units present in its 11 parashiyyot have a fixed ordering of proems and pericope comments.25 It should also be noted that thematic expositions, when they appear, tend to precede pericope comments, as was the case in LR and PRK. Of the 14 homilies with both elements, 9 show a fixed order (64 percent). However, with the exception of DR, our analysis thus far has shown that a substantial number of homilies in the Yelammedenu-Tanhuma midrashim do not maintain a fixed ordering of structural elements. Proems of all kinds more than occasionally are interspersed among pericope comments (the- 20. The same approximate percentage holds for those units which include halakhic proems (19 of 50). 21. Of the 75 units which contain halakhic proems, 9 have them placed in other than the first position. 22. The sample parashiyyot analyzed include: Lekh lekha, Va-Yese, Ki tissa, Va-Yiqra, Qedoshim, Be-ha'alotekha, Balaq, Mas'ei, Re'eh and NiSSavim. 23. In addition to Pesiqta Rabbati, Tanbuma ha-Nidpas, Tanhuma Buber, and Deuteron- omy Rabbah, two later compilations, Exodus Rabbah and Numbers Rabbah, contain halakhic proems. 24. The fixed structure of the homily form in DR is seen in the fact that every unit begins with a halakhic proem, with the opening question/answer formula halakhah 'adam mi-yisra'el ... kakh shanu bakhamim, followed by one or more regular proems with the formula zeh she-'amar ha-katuv. Additionally, the size of the units varies only slightly. Almost all have between 6 and 8 sections. 25. The only unit which does not have a fixed order of elements is found in parashat Zot ha-berakhah and it appears to be defective, since it possesses a second halakhic proem.</page><page sequence="7">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 7 matic and exegetic) and they, in turn, follow no set order. Heinemann already noted this when, in passing, he commented that there are structural- ly defective homilies in the Yelammedenu-Tanhuma midrashim.26 The question must be asked, however, whether the breakdown of the fixed structure of the literary homily in the Pesiqta Rabbati and the other later homiletic midrashim indeed is the result of a confusion of form and poor editing or whether it is purposeful. Perhaps contrary to Heinemann's view, the compilers of these homilies consciously chose to deviate from the previously accepted fixed structure in an effort to enhance the quality of their work. After all, Heinemann himself noted that the editors or compilers of the homilies in LR and PRK consciously limited their creative freedom by their desire to follow the standard form of the parashah or pisqa.27 In order to understand better the nature of the dissolution of fixed homiletic structure in the Yelammedenu-Tanhiuma midrashim, I shall com- pare two closely parallel homilies in the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana and the Pesiqta Rabbati. If there is a greater degree of editing as a result of the flexi- bility of form in the PR homily, we may begin to consider seriously the pos- sibility that the compiler, in an effort to maximize his ability to work creatively with existing traditions, consciously avoided a fixed ordering. If, on the other hand, the quality of the Yelammedenu-Tanhiuma homily is not improved by the lack of ordering of the proems and pericope comments, then Heinemann's view of the defective nature of the later homilies is probably correct.28 II A Comparison of Parallel Pisqa'ot a.

However, it can give us an indication as to the direction our thinking must take. 29. B.T. Megillah 29b.</page><page sequence="8">8 NORMAN J. COHEN And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: "When you take the sum of the chil- dren of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man ran- som for his soul unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them. When you number them, this they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel is twenty gerahs; half a shekel for an offering to the Lord. Every one that passes among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and up, shall give the offering of the Lord. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than the half shekel when they give the offering of the Lord, to make atonement for your souls... 2:1-Regular Proem. This is based on Psalms 3:3-4: "There are many who say of me: 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah. But You, O Lord, protect me, my glory; and raise my head (u-merim roshi)." The proemial text is applied first to Doeg and Ahithophel, and then to Israel and the nations. The key phrase is u-merim roshi which hints at the pericope text (ki tissa 'et rosh benei yisra'el .. .), and forces the reader to take it literally: "When you raise up the heads of the Israelites," i.e., when you enhance their status. The essential point is that Israel deserved to die (haramat rosh) because of the sin of the Golden Calf, but God forgave them and returned them to their for- mer position (tillui rosh).30 2:2-Short Regular Proem. The proemial text is drawn from Proverbs 15:19: "The way of the slothful is as though hedged by thorns; but the path of the upright is even." The passage contrasts the demands made upon the Jews by Rome and by God: while Rome (Esau) demands exorbitant taxes of various kinds, God asks only for half a shekel. 2:3-Regular Proem. The proemial text is Isaiah 2:9: "And man bows low, and man lowers himself; and You cannot bear (tissa) with them." Again, we have a short proem which has only one application-to Moses and Israel. Both are downtrodden following the Golden Calf incident. Nevertheless, Moses defends Israel and convinces God to forgive them. The interpretation plays upon the word tissa, which sets up a linguistic tie to the pericope text. 30. This comment is clearly apologetic and can be viewed as an anti-Christian polemic. The nations of the world, i.e., Christendom, claimed that the Jewish people was no longer the "True Israel," God's covenanted partner, because they rejected Him when they built the Golden Calf. In response, the rabbis stressed that even though Israel should have been punished, God ulti- mately forgave them and the covenant remained in full force.</page><page sequence="9">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 9 2:4-Regular Proem. It opens with Psalms 75:8: "For God is judge; He puts down one and lifts up another (ve-zeh yarim)." This is a long, composite proem whose last section provides an explicit connection with the pericope text.' Following a story about R. Yosi and a matrona discussing God's ability as a matchmaker and a passage about Aaron, the proemial text is applied to Israel and the Golden Calf. The main point is clear: the giving of half a shekel atones for the sin of the Calf (zeh yarim); and the underlying play on the pericope text is beautiful: zeh yittenu kol ha-'over 'al ha- pequdim--"this [the half shekel] they shall give who transgresses ('over/ 'averah) God's commandments (piqqudim)." 2.:5-Regular Proem. This is a long composite proem based upon Proverbs 14:34: "Righteousness exalts (teromem) a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." The proemial text is applied in various ways to Israel and the nations, with the sins of Israel and the peoples' reactions to them being emphasized. However, the sin of the Golden Calf is never explicitly men- tioned. The last application of the proemial verse brings us back to the peri- cope text through the obvious linguistic connection (teromem/tissa) and makes the most important point: due to their contribution to the building of the Tabernacle, the Israelites were elevated (tillui rosh) in God's eyes. We note that half a shekel is not mentioned here in this regard. 2:6-Regular Proem. The proemial verse is Proverbs 10:20: "The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is little worth." This is a composite proem in which the proemial text is associated at first with Jeroboam and then with God and Moses, bringing us back at the end to the pericope text. This final application is defective, since only the first portion of the proemial text is interpreted, and its wording is very terse: "This is the Holy One, blessed be He, who saw that Moses chose his words carefully (hivhir 'et leshono shel Mosheh)." The point would be totally unclear if this comment were not paralleled in the second proem: "God framed the words Moses was to utter (hikhshir 'et leshono shel Mosheh)." Both emphasize God's desire to elevate Israel through Moses. 2:7-Body of Sermon. Though this section begins like a thematic exposi- 31. A composite proem is one in which the entire proemial text is applied to a series of events or biblical personages. The last application returns the reader to the pericope text.</page><page sequence="10">10 NORMAN J. COHEN tion with the formula mah katuv le-ma'alah min ha-'inyan? and cites a verse from Exodus 30:10, it really is the start of a series of exegetic comments upon the pericope text which runs through the remainder of the homily. The first is a word play on tissa/tasheh which introduces the idea that Israel can atone (gain kapparah) for its sins. Following this, the pericope phrase 'et rosh is interpreted to show that Reuben is not excluded from the census taken of the nation because of his sin with Bilhah. This is the first association with the actual subject of Parashat Sheqalim, the taking of a census of the people. There follows a series of five parables which under- score God's special love for Israel. Israel are singled out because only they recognized God's kingship and willingly accepted His law. We finally under- stand why God did not hesitate to forgive Israel's sins. 2.:8-With the exposition of the word li-fequdeihem (according to their numbers), the editor continues his focus upon the counting of the people. Moses' enumeration totals 597,000, 3,000 less than the 600,000 mentioned in Exodus. The missing 3,000 are those who died during the episode of the Golden Calf. A parable is brought at this point to emphasize even further that the purpose of the census (in Parashat Sheqalim) was to find out how many expired as a result of the building of the Calf. The section concludes with a listing of the ten scriptural passages in which Israel is counted. 2:9-The motif of counting continues as a parable and is cited to show that those of Israel who died will be replaced in the future. Perhaps again this is due to God's inordinate love for Israel. The point then is made that the tak- ing of a census when not commanded by God will result in a plague upon the people, as in the time of King David. Finally, there is an added comment upon the phrase ve-natenu 'ish kofer nafsho (then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul), extant only in the Safed manuscript, in which fines levied in cases like slander and rape are considered in an effort to determine the amount of "ransom" to be given because of the Golden Calf. The result is clear: God again is pictured as demanding only half a shekel as atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf. 2:10-Exegesis upon the verse zeh yittenu kol ha-'over 'al ha-pequdim emphasizes explicitly the causal relationship between the sin of the Golden Calf and the giving of half a shekel. The homily ends with an explanation of the three cases in which Moses heard commands from God and was startled. The last case, which revolves on the pericope phrase ve-natenu 'ish kofer</page><page sequence="11">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 11 nafsho, reiterates the question alluded to before, concerning the possibility of giving an adequate ransom for one's soul. The answer is also the same as offered in prior sections: God's demands upon Israel are minimal. The derashah aptly concludes with the citation of Psalms 144:15 ("Happy is the people whose God is the Lord") and Psalms 146:5 ("Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob"), which serve to praise the people of Israel and to emphasize its continuing covenantal relationship with God. Overview. This second homily in the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana shows a certain degree of editing. Its edited nature is reflected in the fact that individual motifs introduced in earlier parts of the derashah either are picked up in later sections and are extended, or they are integrated together in subsequent material. Note, for example, how in the first three proems two different points are made: God forgives Israel's sin of the Golden Calf (sections 2:1 and 2:3) and God makes a minimal demand upon Israel of half a shekel (sec- tion 2:2). Then, in the fourth proem (on Psalms 75:8), a connection is made between them, when it is stated that giving half a shekel atones for the sin of the Calf. It is clear, however, that these themes broached in the proems also are reiterated in the body of the homily and their relationship is clarified further. In this regard, see how the material in section 2:9 (found in the Safed manuscript) and in the final section of the derashah repeat in an even more dramatic way the connection between the Golden Calf incident and Parashat Sheqalim. In the body of the derashah we even find answers to questions implicit in motifs discussed in the proems. Note how the five parables in section 2:7, which emphasize God's special love for Israel, answer the questions of why it is that God forgave Israel's sin of building the Calf and why He offered them the giving of half a shekel as a means of atonement. The hand of an editor is also evident in the occasional flow of material from one section to the next. A good illustration is the motif of the counting of the people which is introduced in section 2:7 and then is spelled out in greater detail in sections 2:8 and 2:9, which have this theme as their sole focus. Yet, even though this pisqa on Ki tissa is the product of a fair amount of editing, it is not a fully developed, well integrated homily. This is evident first in the fact that the derashah has two distinct themes which are not wholly interwoven: a) the sin of the Golden Calf and Israel's atonement through the giving of half a shekel, and b) the counting of the people as ordered in Parashat Sheqalim. Notwithstanding the points made about Moses' enumeration of the people which showed how many were killed due</page><page sequence="12">12 NORMAN J. COHEN to the Golden Calf (section 2:8) and God's promise to fill the Israelite ranks in the future (section 2:9), these two motifs are not effectively integrated by the editor. Second, at times the developing theme is not carried over from one section to the next. For example, the material about the demands made upon Israel by Rome and God in the second proem breaks the flow between proem I and proem 3 which deal with the Golden Calf sin and God's for- giving Israel. Similarly, after having focused upon the sin of the Calf and the giving of half a shekel as its means of atonement in section 2:4, the compiler speaks in very general terms about the sins of Israel in the following section (2:5) without mentioning the Golden Calf explicitly. In addition, in proem 5 he also introduces the notion of the contribution of each Israelite to the building of the Tabernacle as a vehicle for the uplifting of the nation in God's eyes, while ignoring the giving of half a shekel. Another indication of the limited nature of the editing in this pisqa is the abundance of superfluous material present.32 Note, in this regard, the story of R. Yosi and the matrona in proem 4, the application of the proemial text in section 2:6 to Jeroboam, the comment about Reuben's not being excluded from the counting in sec- tion 2:7, and the passage delineating the differences between the census taken by Moses and that carried out by David (section 2:9). All are quite far removed from the major thrust of the homily. Even though the end of the homily provides a fitting peroration and the final comment on the phrase ve-natenu 'ish kofer nafsho reemphasizes the homily's main point (that God demanded half a shekel as a means of atone- ment for Israel's sins), one does not get the impression that this is a well developed homily which builds to a dramatic finish. The lack of integration of the major motifs, the break in the thematic flow from section to section, and the presence of much superfluous material all underscore the fact that this pisqa possesses only a limited degree of editing. b. Pesiqta Rabbati, pisqa 10. This homily is directly parallel to pisqa 2 of the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana and these derashot, which are based on Exodus 32. The presence to some extent of superfluous material in the homily is due not only to the compiler's lack of selectivity of material at his disposal, but also to his tendency not to adapt or change the blocks (balivot) of material he drew upon. Heinemann labels this process as gerirah, the inclusion of superfluous material because of the usage of total blocks of tradition by the editor of the homily. In addition, the compiler included popular folk traditions which, even though they were not directly associated with the main theme, added a necessary dramatic element to the derashah. In this regard, see Heinemann's comments in "'Omanut," pp. 810-1 1, 823 and "Profile of a Midrash," p. 146.</page><page sequence="13">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 13 30:11-16, contain much material in common. This surely is the result of the utilization of traditions found in PRK by the compiler of the homily in PR.33 10:1-Halakhic Proem. The opening question/answer concerning money withdrawn from the Temple for the purchase of sacrificial animals leads to an emphasis upon the early announcement of money due the Temple treasury. This was done so as not to place any burden on the Jewish People. The theme of God's minimal demands upon Israel is underscored further by a comment on the verse from Proverbs 15:19 ("The way of the slothful is as though hedged by thorns, but the path of the upright is even"), which is a reworked parallel to the second proem in PRK, pisqa 2. This interpretation contrasts the demands of Rome with those of God: while Rome's exactions are exorbitant, God's request is minimal. He demands only half a shekel, which is viewed as a means of expiation for Israel's sins. In addition to emphasizing at the very outset of the homily the notion that giving half a shekel is a vehicle for Israel's atonement, the compiler also introduced, at the end of the first proem, the idea that because of Israel's sins their numbers would have been diminished whenever a census was taken, if it were not for the half-shekel contribution. 10:2-4-Regular Proem. This long, extended proem is based upon Song of Songs 7:3:34 "Your navel is like a round goblet wherein no mingled wine is wanting; your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies." After the first half of the verse is interpreted as referring to the Sanhedrin, the rest of the text is applied to Israel. Israel, like wheat, is the staff of life and its con- tinued existence is necessary for the world's survival. The other nations are likened to chaff, but Israel is the life-giving force of the world. Therefore, just as the steward must keep track of the amounts of grain, Moses is instructed by God to count Israel. This leads back to the pericope text ("ki tissa 'et rosh benei Yisra'el"). 105-Thematic Exposition. This section continues the motif of the census 33. Modern scholarship generally assumes that the compiler(s) of the homilies in PR knew and used material in earlier compilations, like Genesis Rabbah and Leviticus Rabbah, in addi- tion to the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. See, for example, the survey of scholarly opinion in the introduction to Braude's translation of Pesiqta Rabbati, pp. 21-26. 34. There are only two proems in PR, pisqa 10, which are not found in the PRK parallel. They are sections 10:2 and 10:9.</page><page sequence="14">14 NORMAN J. COHEN through a king-parable whose essential point is that only Israel must be counted because God treasures them more than any other people. This is the result of all the anguish and trouble (sa'ar) Israel caused God before their relationship was solidified. Israel is described as "the son who cost Me such a dear price" (Jeremiah 31:20). 10:6-Regular Proem. The proemial text is Isaiah 2:9: "And man bows low, and man lowers himself; and You cannot bear (tissa) them." Though quite extended and reworked, this section directly parallels proem 3 in PRK, pisqa 2. The text is applied to both Israel and Moses who are downtrodden due to the sin of the Golden Calf. Moses pleads with God for Israel to be restored to its greatness and, in the end, God relents and forgives them. We return to the pericope text with God's injunction to Moses: Ki tissa 'et rosh benei Yis- ra'el-"You raise up the heads of the Israelites," i.e., return them to their former glory.35 10:7-Exegetic Comment. The interpretation plays upon the word tissa and extends the previous point. Because of its sins, Israel deserves death (hara- mat rosh), but nevertheless they shall be elevated (tillui rosh): "Hafokh 'et ha-lashon ve-romem 'et rosham." Additionally, mention is made again of how much God had to suffer because of Israel. 10:8-Regular Proem. It is based upon Psalms 75:8: "For God is judge; He puts down one and lifts up another." This proem is found in PRK 2:4, though with a totally different emphasis. Here the text is used to stress that God punishes those deserving of punishment. All those who participated in the building of the Golden Calf will be brought low. The proem is short and defective in that it does not return in the end to the pericope text. 10:9-Regular Proem. This short, composite proem is based on Job 33:23-24: "If there be for him an angel and intercessor, one among a thou- sand to vouch for man's uprightness, then He is gracious unto him and says: 'Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found ransom.' " This text is applied at first to humanity in general and then to Israel. Moses intercedes 35. At the end of section 10:6, the Parma MS preserves a better reading than the printed edition, which allows for a more fluid transition to the pericope text: 3rx'K !1x nx :n"-in 1~ 1- n , K3 W K K- f n 'n... ?

As the proem abruptly ends, we are left wondering what God's response to Moses' pleas will be. 10O.10-Regular Proem. The proemial text is Psalms 3:3-4: "There are many who say of me: 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah. But You, O Lord, protect me, my glory; and raise up my head." This short, composite proem is very similar to the opening section in the PRK homily, though it is somewhat selectively utilized.36 The point made in the final application of the proemial text to Israel seems like a continuation of the previous pas- sage.37 At the end of the confrontation with Moses, God finally agrees to forgive Israel's sin of the Golden Calf and to restore its glory. Though many claimed that God had rejected Israel because of the building of the Calf, the covenant nevertheless continued to be in effect. 10:11-Exegetic Comments. The point of the entire section is that God's special love for Israel is due to its acceptance of His kingship. God, there- fore, is elevated when Israel is exalted in the world. The key play comes on the phrase ki tissa 'et rosh-"when you exalt the head," i.e., God. The point is made through three parables which are drawn from PRK 2:7, where they are found in a different order and a much more extended form. 10:12-Exegetic Comments. The section opens with the same play on the phrase ki tissa 'et rosh as above, emphasizing Israel's elevation of God. In the process, the editor connects the giving of half a shekel with the building of the Tabernacle by stating that Israel contributed to the erection of the Tabernacle, in which God's presence was found, and "carried" it through the desert (ve-hem nose'im 'otah .. . ki tissa 'et rosh). This is followed by exegesis upon the phrase zeh yittenu, etc. which associates the giving of half a shekel with the incident of the Golden Calf. Whoever transgressed God's commandments (kol ha-'over 'al ha-pequdim) shall give half a shekel (zeh yittenu ... mahasit ha-sheqel) as a means of atonement. 36. Not only is the application of the proemial verse to Doeg and Ahithophel left out com- pletely, but also note how the play between haramat rosh and tillui rosh, so essential in PRK 2:1, is not included. This is due to the fact that the same point was made already in section 10:7. 37. The connection between this section and the previous one is underscored by the use of the same verse (Exodus 22:19: "He who sacrifices unto the gods, save the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed") to highlight the fact that Israel deserves punishment.</page><page sequence="16">16 NORMAN J. COHEN 10O.13-Thematic Derash. This section continues the emphasis on the causal relationship between the sin of the Golden Calf and the giving of half a shekel. God's very special love for Israel is reflected in the fact that even their sins lead to positive results. For example, the sale of Joseph by his brothers resulted in the saving of the whole world during the years of famine.38 Similarly, the sin of the Calf led to the commandment regarding the giving of half a shekel. 10.:14-Thematic Derash. There is a listing of the ten occasions in Scripture when Israel was counted, concluding with the enumeration in the World to Come, as described in Jeremiah 33:13. Additionally, there is a clarification of the motif mentioned in the opening proem of the diminution of Israel's numbers as a result of the taking of a census. It is stated that Israel's population decreased when a census was taken without God's command, as was the case in the days of King David. Yet, whatever loss was sustained at that time was made up during the reign of Solomon, as 1 Kings 4:20 indi- cates: "Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is on the sea- shore."39 10:15-Exegetic Comments. The first part of the section focuses on the peri- cope phrase ve-natenu 'ish kofer nafsho and underscores the notion that Israel indeed deserved death due to their building of the Golden Calf, but God provided them a means of atonement. Though one might have thought that God's demands would be substantial, as in the case of rape, seduction, slander and an ox that gores, He asked only for half a shekel. This point flows again from the phrase zeh yittenu, etc. and leads to an interpretation of Psalms 75:8 ("For God is judge; He puts down one and lifts up another [zeh yarim]") which was the proemial text in section 10:8.40 38. The interpretation here is "'they sat down to eat (le-'ekhol)' [Genesis 37:25] means that they made it possible for the entire world to eat (le-ha'akhil lehem le-khol ha 'olam)." 39. It is interesting to note that this verse (1 Kings 4:20) is the first proemial text in the next homily (PR 11:2). In addition, in the Parma MS the order of the final sections of this pisqa differs markedly from that of the printed edition. The final sections are arranged in the follow- ing order: 10:15, 12, 13, and 14. This would indicate that section 10:14 ended the homily and might have provided a transition to the next pisqa. It should also be pointed out that while sec- tion 10:15 continues the comments upon the phrase zeh yittenu, section 10:14 contains exegesis of the total pericope text. Again, sections 12, 13 and 15 might be better placed together, with the homily concluding with the more generalized comments in section 14. 40. Perhaps this comment was appended here when section 15 was placed at the end of the derashah in the prototype of the printed edition. In this way, it would provide a kind of perora- tion at the close.</page><page sequence="17">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 17 Overview. In contrast to its PRK parallel, pisqa 10 of the Pesiqta Rabbati is a more fully developed, better edited homily. This is seen primarily in the fact that the two distinct motifs present in the pisqa are successfully intermeshed by the editor. In addition, the homily seems to flow smoothly from one sec- tion to the next until it reaches a climax in the final sections. The Rabbati homily has less superfluous material and fewer loose ends. It also should be noted that in many of its sections, the editor employed traditions from pisqa 2 of PRK, changing their placement, and adapting and expanding them to fit the thematic development. The two basic themes of the homily are the same as in PRK, pisqa 2: a) God's love for Israel as reflected in the counting of the people, and b) Israel's atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf through the giving of half a shekel. These motifs are alluded to in a very general way at the outset (sec- tion 10:1), when it is stated that God demanded only half a shekel as a means of expiation, and its collection also ensures that Israel's numbers would not be diminished when a census was taken. Mention is made neither of the Golden Calf, nor of the connection between it and the half-shekel contribution. Sections 10:2-4 continue the discussion of the census, empha- sizing that the enumeration of Israel is due to God's love for the Jewish People and its importance for the world's survival. The following section (10:5) serves as a transition between the two major themes of the homily. At first it extends the notion that Israel is more loved by God than any other nation and, therefore, must be counted. Then it alludes to the sin of the Golden Calf by noting that the Jewish people are God's beloved because of the added "trouble" they caused Him. Following this, sections 10:6-10:10 spell out the nature of the anguish which Israel wrought upon God. Though Israel deserved to die because of the incident with the Golden Calf, they were forgiven by God after Moses pleaded their case. Within this block of material, a somewhat graded development of theme is apparent: first God is pictured as a stern judge punishing those who sinned (section 10:8); then Moses pleads their cause (section 10:9); finally God agrees to forgive and elevate them again. Having introduced the idea that Israel can atone for its sin of building the Calf, the editor now, for the first time, introduces the con- nection between the giving of half a shekel and the sin. Following the order in the Parma manuscript,41 sections 10:15, 12 and 13, which embody exe- 41. See n. 35 above. Parma MS 1240 is the only extant complete manuscript of Midrash Pesiqta Rabbati, and its readings and ordering of material usually are better than those of the printed version.</page><page sequence="18">18 NORMAN J. COHEN getic comments on the pericope phrase zeh yittenu kol ha-'over 'al ha- pequdim, stress that atonement for the Golden Calf sin is effected through the half-shekel contribution. This is indeed a minimal demand for the ransom of one's soul! The main point of the homily is stated explicitly at the end of section 10:13 where God's love for Israel specifically leads to the causal relationship between the giving of half a shekel and the Golden Calf incident. Finally, section 10:14, correctly placed as the concluding segment of the homily in the Parma manuscript, brings the derashah full-circle by returning to the first theme mentioned at the outset: the taking of a census and the diminution of Israel's numbers as a result. Additionally, it provides a transition to the next PR pisqa by adding, at the conclusion of the homily, a comment upon 1 Kings 4:20, the first proemial text in pisqa 11. Thus the homily flows well from beginning to end and, in the process, we see the hand of an editor who has shaped a well integrated derashah which builds to an affective climax. The integrated nature of this homily is reflected as well in the presence of only a limited amount of superfluous material and of submotifs not asso- ciated in some way with the major themes. Note, for example, the linguistic tie between the proemial text in section 10:2 ("Your navel is like a round goblet wherein no mingled wine is wanting [yebsar]") and its application to the Sanhedrin, on the one hand, and the theme of bissaron, diminution of Israel's numbers in the census, mentioned at the end of the opening halakhic proem, on the other. Similarly, the motif of the Israelites' contributions to the building of the Tabernacle, which in PRK 2:5 is unrelated to the theme of Parashat Sheqalim, is integrated with the giving of half a shekel in PR, pisqa 10:12. The extent of the editing in this Rabbati homily also is evident in the degree to which its editor utilized and adapted material available from the parallel derashah in PRK. Though, like the editor of pisqa 2 of PRK, he was hesitant about changing blocks of material upon which he drew, the compiler of the PR homily was a bit more selective in his use of the earlier traditions. He occasionally discarded seemingly superfluous material and expanded rele- vant comments to enhance the development of the theme. As an example, note how the PR editor reworked and extended the third proem in PRK, pisqa 2, in an effort to underscore God's merciful treatment of Israel (section 10:6). In contrast, the application of the proemial text in section 10:10 is much more limited than the parallel version in PRK 2:1. In a similar vein, three parables in the following section (10:11), which illustrate Israel's acceptance of God's kingship, are drawn from PRK 2:7 where they are set</page><page sequence="19">STRUCTURE IN THE HOMILETIC MIDRASHIM 19 within a series of five parables which are somewhat more extensive and are ordered differently. He also changed the placement of structural entities. At times he mixed pericope comments with proems in order to improve the homily's thematic development. In this regard, note how the proemial text from the second section of the PRK homily is placed within the halakhic proem (section 10:1) so as to juxtapose at the outset of the pisqa God's mini- mal demand upon Israel and the giving of half a shekel which brings atone- ment. Another illustration is section 10:5 which is a pericope comment found among a series of proems. The more flexible homiletic structure in Midrash Pesiqta Rabbati allowed the editor to set this material earlier in the homily, so that it might serve as a key transition between the two major blocks of material. Section 10:6, which we saw was an expanded version of the proem found in PRK 2:3, is better placed in this part of the PR homily, since it deals with the sin of the Golden Calf and Moses' pleading Israel's cause. Likewise, the summary listing of the ten places in Scripture where Israel is counted, ending with the enumeration in the World to Come, is placed more suitably at the conclusion of the PR derashah (10: 14) than in its PRK counterpart (2:8). III Conclusion Pisqa 2, Ki tissa, in the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana is a homily which reflects a certain degree of editing. It is quite homogeneous, containing themes which are reiterated throughout the derashah. Individual motifs introduced at the outset are clarified and extended in the latter parts of the homily. To some extent, pisqa 2 conforms to Joseph Heinemann's evaluation of the degree of editing of the rabbinic homily.42 He believed that the para- shiyyot and pisqa'ot of Leviticus Rabbah and Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana are not simply haphazard collections of traditional material, but are highly edited homilies which have a unified theme.43 Heinemann concluded that 42. See n. 5 above for a listing of Heinemann's main publications dealing with the nature of the early rabbinic homily. 43. Heinemann, "'Omanut," p. 809, n. 1. There are those, however, who differ with Heinemann's view of the rabbinic homily, chief among them being Abraham Goldberg. Gold- berg feels that the derashot do not show a great measure of editing, and that if at times there is a degree of uniformity, it is due only to the chance repetition of certain themes.</page><page sequence="20">20 NORMAN J. COHEN the editors of these pieces selected material from traditions already shaped into units and they, in turn, welded these units into derashot. The material utilized was ordered and integrated, and this ensured thematic development. Selectivity and integration were the two keys to the editors' creativity.44 However, in comparison to the homily in the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, pisqa 10 of Pesiqta Rabbati is more highly edited and, therefore, more closely coincides with Heinemann's portrayal of the derashah. It is an example of a well integrated homily which possesses a unified, developing theme. Since PR is a composite work made up of a variety of styles and material,45 it is especially true that analysis of one pisqa cannot conclusively tell us about the degree of effective editing in the compilation as a whole. Nevertheless, we can perhaps learn something about the Yelammedenu- Tanhuma homilies in the Rabbati, in particular, and in other Yelammedenu- Tanhuma compilations, in general, from pisqa 10. As was demonstrated previously, Yelammedenu-Tanhuma midrashim possess a substantial number of homilies which have no fixed ordering of structural elements. Not only do the thematic and exegetic comments on the pericope text not follow any set order, but proems are interwoven with expositional comments throughout the derashah. In addition, we have analyzed one Yelammedenu-Tanbuma homily which reflects an even greater degree of editing than its earlier counterparts in Leviticus Rabbah and Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana. Therefore, it is very plausible that the break- down in the fixed structure of the rabbinic derashah was due to a conscious decision on the part of editors to enhance the artful editing of their homilies. Deviation from the previously accepted fixed tripartite structure and the resultant flexibility of form probably led to a maximizing of the editors' creative ability and to the production of more homogeneous derashot.
