<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gershon Shaked. Modern Hebrew Fiction. Translated by Yael Lotan, edited by Emily Miller Budick, Jewish Literature and Culture. Bloomington: Indiana Uni- versity Press, 2000. xiii, 286 pp. We live in the age of the scholarly monograph and the multi-authored his- tory. The shifting and contentious nature of literary studies provides little encour- agement to senior scholars to devote decades of their work to taking the long view and accepting responsibility for rendering a comprehensive account of the devel- opment of a whole field over a substantial period of time. Our epistemological un- certainty is such that we suspect that fairness and truth can be approximated only if we break up the whole among divers hands and listen to different viewpoints. There is, then, something bracingly old fashioned about Gershon Shaked's imposing five-volume Hebrew work, Hasipporet ha'ivrit 1880-1980 [Hebrew 161</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Fiction 1880-1980], which appeared between 1977 and 1999. (The work under review, which I will discuss below, is the one-volume English abridgement of this larger endeavor.) Shaked's project is genuinely ambitious. Within this great hundred-year arc, Shaked seeks to establish the place of each of the scores of writ- ers who wrote serious fiction in Hebrew; to map out the networks of traditions and counter-traditions; to connect aesthetic developments to larger social and ideolog- ical transformations; to render a critical description as well as an evaluation of all the key individual works; and, finally, to gauge the degree and quality of influence that strong authors have had upon later writers. The aspiration to mount such an undertaking-which Shaked pulls off with astonishing success-is founded on the refreshing assumption that the fruits of generations of literary criticism form a body of knowledge and that this research can be culled, utilized, summarized, and advanced rather than remaining merely a mass of ideologically driven mis- readings. Although the beneficent ghost of positivism may be looking over Shaked's shoulder, there is nothing musty about his literary history. His critical practice is founded on some of the key developments of literary criticism in our time. Shaked's background in New Criticism makes him supremely attentive to varieties of narrators, strategies of narration, and techniques of characterization. His train- ing in genre theory accounts for his passion for locating writers and their work within-and at odds with-the generic conventions of romanticism, realism, nat- uralism, modernity, the comic-grotesque, and other movements, trends, and modes of writing. An interest in stylistics prompts Shaked to track the changes in the way Hebrew is used to construct narrative discourse. A Lukacsian commitment to the organic nexus between history and literature leads him to see fictional characters as complex representations of social forces and class consciousness. Finally, re- ception theory explains his acute interest in how works of literature were under- stood by contemporary audiences and by readers at later removes of time. It bears keeping in mind that although the five volumes of Hebrew Fiction cover a hundred-year period, they themselves appeared over a period of more than twenty years. This means that just as the subject under scrutiny was in motion, forming and reforming itself, Shaked's appetitive mind was at the same time also in motion, ranging widely and bringing different critical emphases to the fore. An attentive reading of the whole Hebrew work would notice, for example, how is- sues of reception become more central in later volumes and how Shaked's manner of engaging his material moves from a monographic account of a single author's work to a series of thematic essays that return to the same works in different con- texts. There is a similar dynamic relationship between Shaked's subject and his own life. His situation is decidedly not like that of Leopold Zunz, the great nine- teenth-century Wissenschaft scholar, who is supposed to have said when a young Hebrew poet appeared at his door, "What century did you live in?" Shaked's schol- arly career, and especially the years he worked on Hebrew Fiction, coincided with an unparalleled boom in Israeli prose writing that gives little sign of abating. And he has been an actor in the enterprise whose history he is writing. As a student in Jerusalem in the fifties, Shaked was part of a circle centered around the journal 162</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Likr'a-together with Yehuda Amichai, Natan Zach, Amos Oz, A. B. Yehoshua, Benjamin Harshovski-Harshav, and Dan Miron-which challenged the social re- alism and pathos of the Palmah Generation writers. Even though Shaked is not himself a novelist, he has been inextricably and intimately involved in the critical reception of the fiction of his contemporaries, the writers of the New Wave, in- cluding Aharon Appelfeld, and Amalia Kahane-Carmon, as well as Oz and Yeho- shua. Yet unlike Oz and Yehoshua, Shaked is not a sabra. He was born Gerhardt Mandel in Vienna and was brought to Eretz Yisrael by his parents, who came more as refugees than as settlers. The ordeal of immigration gave Shaked an unusual empathy for the experiences of uprootedness, dislocation, and exile at the center of the great works of Hebrew literature created at an earlier period in Europe. There is a great deal to admire in the objectivity of Shaked's scholarship. He has read everything and attempts to locate everything in a complex and mul- ti-strand narrative of the development of Hebrew fiction. Each writer, even those who played a role in their time but whose reputations and influence have faded out of sight and even those whose literary achievements obviously do not stir Shaked's sympathies, receives his considered attention. He puts them in context, reminds us of the substance of the books they wrote, offers a critical description of the po- etics of their fiction, and assesses the imprint they made upon later Hebrew writ- ers. Yet despite the project's analytic comprehensiveness, it is impossible to write serious and ambitious literary history without at the same time engaging in the creation of an implied canon of modern Hebrew literature. (Despite all the driv- el written about the hegemony and the evils of canon formation, let it be stated clearly that making arguments for the importance of strong works of art-the main business of literary critics of which canons are a byproduct-is a chief re- sponsibility that intellectuals discharge toward their culture.) At the center of Shaked's canon, their place marked by the ample attention given them and by the vigor of his arguments, stand the works of Mendele (Abromovitch), Berdichev- sky, Brenner, Gnessin, Agnon, Hazaz, Shamir, Oz, Appelfeld and Yehoshua. Their centrality is purchased, in Shaked's eyes, by the nexus effected in their work be- tween the embroiled investigation of the fate of the Jewish collective and the art- ful practice of literary modernism in its many forms. Like all great historical schol- ars, Shaked judges and analyzes with his feet planted firmly in his time and place. The writing of Hebrew Fiction was begun when this nexus, the Zionist "metaplot," still held together and had achieved greatness in the works of Shaked's contem- poraries, the members of the Dor hamedinah, the State Generation. Shaked's pro- ject was brought to a close, on a note that is both elegaic and anxious, at a time when that nexus had been attenuated by the assertions of post-Zionism and post- modernism. Like all abridgements of great multi-volume foreign-language works of schol- arship, the English volume under review is more useful than it is successful. It is as if some grand Balzacian character was forced to submit to the ravages of a Dra- conian diet. The face remains recognizable and all the limbs are still there, but the flesh hangs on the bone and the sheen of vitality is gone. Gone, too, is the vast ap- paratus of endnotes and references to the history of Hebrew literary criticism that makes the Hebrew volumes an indispensable compendium as well as a work of 163</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews original critical thought. This is entirely comprehensible in a work intended to be an introduction to Hebrew fiction for the English reader. Yet if that is indeed the aim, it is entirely incomprehensible why there should be no mention of any criti- cal literature written in English. There is no reference to the works of Arnold Band, Robert Alter, Anne Golumb Hoffman, Naomi Sokoloff, Gilead Morahg, and oth- er American critics of Hebrew literature, not to mention the hundreds of articles in Prooftexts and Hebrew Studies over the years. What remains is Shaked's chron- icle of the development of Hebrew fiction and the bibliography of primary works (translations duly noted). While this is certainly valuable enough, the utility of the volume would have been greatly augmented if readers-and students-could have been directed to secondary readings taken from the serious enterprise of com- menting on Hebrew literature that has grown up on these shores. The sterling accomplishment that remains undiminished in the English vol- ume is the contours of the map Shaked draws of Hebrew fiction. Making a map is, in a sense, at odds with making a canon. The great authors in Shaked's pantheon are mostly known to us and well represented in translation. Less familiar are the dozens of contemporaneous Hebrew writers in each generation whose serious works provides a context and counter-context for the achievements of the canon- ical writers. So, for example, we know the writings of Oz, Yehoshua, and Ap- pelfeld, and our conception of contemporary Israeli fiction is fashioned around their work. Yet, as Shaked points out, there a number of strong authors from this period, including Benjamin Tammuz, Pinhas Sadeh, Yitzhak Orpaz, and Yehoshua Kenaz, whose work cannot be easily assimilated to the paradigms created by the dominant figures of the time. Rather than simply describing the work of these oth- ers writers, Shaked takes responsibility for drawing a complex map which can make sense of these achievements in relation to one another. It is in the attempt to see things whole that Shaked's intellectual imagination shines. On this score I was particularly grateful for Shaked's chapter on Hebrew fic- tion between the two world wars. This period is a kind of interregnum between the earlier breakthroughs of Brenner and his generation and the new literature that arose after the creation of the state of Israel. For most of us, Agnon is the great eminence that presides over these years; to a lesser degree, Hazaz. Yet Agnon is precisely the example of the great canonical writer who flies above his contem- poraries and, sharing very little with them, blots them out, so that by knowing Agnon we may know a great deal but not about the intensive fictional activity dur- ing the twenties, thirties, and forties. In addition to the center in Palestine, there was David Vogel writing in Vienna and Paris and Shimon Halkin and Reuven Wal- lenrod writing in New York. (Shaked's chapter on Hebrew literature in America is the only such account I know.) In Eretz Yisrael itself there was rivalry among the journals Ketuvim, Moznayim, and Gilyonot and the writers allied with them. Fic- tion grounded in the realities of the Yishuv was being written by Israel Zarchi, Avigdor Hameiri, Yehudah Yaari, and Yitzhak Shenhar, while the standard of the European narrative was being upheld in the novels of Eliezer Steinman and Yaa- cov Horowitz. Taking in the lay of fictional landscape for the first time, with Shaked's help, I have resolved to revisit these writers, some of whom I have known only glancingly. 164</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Taken as a whole, the map Shaked has drawn of development of Hebrew fic- tion, together with the rich insights about individual writers found in the Hebrew volumes, make this work an enduring achievement. For many years to come, it will be instinctive for students to check what Shaked has to say before embarking on any task of criticism. Like the great synthesizing and summarizing work of other eminences of his generation, his magnum opus is just as likely over time to have its paradigms poked, challenged, and revised.
