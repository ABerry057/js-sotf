Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. xi, 201 pp. Josef Stern's book "focuses on two elements in the Maimonidean revolution in the study of ta 'amei ha-misvot and their impact on Nahmanides. The first is Mai- monides' idea of the problematic commandment. The second is his idea that ex- planations of commandments-both individual laws and the ... totality of com- mandments as a whole ... should be modelled after the multileveled interpretation of parables" (p. 3). In Chapters Two, Three, and Six, Stern discusses Maimonides' 361</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review well-known "historically sensitive, context-dependent ... explanations for the leg- islation of the huqqim" (p. 4). While Stern briefly touches upon a number of prob- lems that Maimonides grapples with in light of these explanations, he focuses on "specific arguments the Guide contains to counter the antinomianism implicit in its explanation of the huqqim" (p. 5). Stern's arguments and readings in these chap- ters are thoughtful and suggestive, if at times open to question, but space con- straints prevent an analysis.' Rather, I will concentrate on the second focus of Stern's work, contained in Chapters One, Two, and Five; namely, his understand- ing of "Maimonides' theory of multileveled parabolic interpretation" (p. 68) and his claim that Maimonides extends this "parabolic model to the explanation of the commandments" (p. 11). Stern notes that in the Introduction to the Guide, Maimonides apparently contradicts himself regarding the relationship between the external (zahir) and in- ternal (batin) meanings of a parable. First, Maimonides states that "the external meaning of a parable is worth nothing," while the internal meaning is "like a pearl," but he immediately reverses and states that the external as compared to the inter- nal meaning is like silver as compared to gold. Stern suggests that Maimonides here "demarcates three levels of meaning ... [that] characterize a parable: . . . 1) the vulgar external meaning [worth nothing], 2) the parabolic external meaning [like silver], and 3) the parabolic internal meaning [like a pearl or gold]" (p. 7). There a number of problems with Stern's suggestion. First, many scholars reconcile these different evaluations by assuming that Maimonides is referring to two types of parables, one where the external meaning is worth nothing, the other where it is "beautiful as silver." This seems to be supported by Maimonides' own observation that the silver/gold relationship "describes a well constructed para- ble." Presumably, in the not so well constructed parable, the worthless/pearl rela- tionship obtains. Stern, perplexingly, does not even mention this popular mode of reconciliation. Moreover, the triadic model forces Stern to conclude that "Maimonides uses the expression 'external meaning' equivocally or amphibolously" (p. 7). But Stern has no textual basis for this assertion. Furthermore, he assumes that Maimonides identifies this vulgar external meaning with the peshat of the text (p. 83) and con- sequently concludes that Maimonides is simply uninterested in peshat. But many statements in both the Guide and the Book of Commandments point to precisely such an interest.2 Stern also minimizes Maimonides' distinction between the silver and gold levels of the "well constructed parable" (pp. 8-9). First, he claims that these lev- els are not addressed to different audiences. But Maimonides explicitly states that, 1. They also prevent my paying more than the barest attention to Stern's remarks about Nahmanides. 2. Stern contrasts Maimonides' supposed neglect ofpeshat with Nahmanides' "deep ... inter- est ... in .. .peshat" (p. 83). In support of this contrast, he cites (p. 84) a passage from Nahmanides' notes on the Book of Commandments, where Nahmanides emphasizes that "even in purely legal con- texts the biblical text never loses its literal meaning." One would never guess from Stern's presentation that Nahmanides is making this point in the midst of a critique of Maimonides for an overemphasis on peshat! In general, Stern's neglect of the Book of Commandments must count as a serious lacuna. 362</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews while everyone can perceive the exterior silver filigree-work, only "the keen-sight- ed observer" can perceive the interior apple of gold. Second, Stern emphasizes that Maimonides describes the silver and gold levels of meaning as kinds of wisdom, the silver level containing wisdom "useful [for] the welfare of human societies," the gold level containing wisdom "useful for belief concerned with the truth as it is," and concludes that both levels are "kinds of philosophy." Here, it seems that Stern blurs the distinction between different types of wisdom despite explicit tex- tual evidence (Guide 3:54) that, to paraphrase Stern, "Maimonides uses the ex- pression 'wisdom' equivocally or amphibolously."3 It is difficult to determine how far Stern wishes to push his claim that Mai- monides extends his "parabolic model to the explanation of the commandments." In the book's title and throughout the work, he refers to the commandments as para- bles. However, parables work by way of symbolization, and, as Stern correctly points out, Maimonides displays a "genuine antipathy" for symbolic interpreta- tions of the commandments (p. 100, referring to the Guide 3:43).4 On the other hand, Stern's weaker claim that there are important parallels be- tween Maimonides' understanding of parables and his understanding of ta 'amei ha-misvot is on firmer ground. Thus, he convincingly suggests that there are two levels of ta 'amei ha-misvot for Maimonides, corresponding to the silver and gold levels of parables. In Guide 3:26-49, the commandments serve the twin goals of welfare of the body and welfare of the soul, that is, the communal good. This cor- responds to the silver level of the parable. In Guide 3:51-52, by contrast, the com- mandments serve the goal of training "one who has apprehended the true realities" to occupy himself with God alone. This corresponds to the gold level of the para- ble.5 Stern's attempt to carry this analogy one step further by arguing that these two levels of ta 'amei ha-misvot are sometimes present in the multiple reasons that Maimonides offers for individual commandments in Guide 3:26-49 is less con- vincing. Thus, Maimonides offers two reasons for the commandment of circumci- sion (Guide 3:49): one, "to weaken the faculty of sexual excitement;" and two, "as a bodily sign uniting all people who profess the unity of God." Stern maintains that the first reason is the internal, "gold" reason for the commandment, since the weakening of bodily desires makes possible the intellectual apprehension of intel- ligible truths, that is, perfection of the soul, while the second reason is its external, "silver" reason, since this bodily sign facilitates teaching true opinions to the mul- titude, that is, welfare of the soul (pp. 102-107). But in the context of Guide 3:26- 49, the acquisition of moral qualities, including the weakening of sexual desire, 3. Nahmanides' understanding of the parable, on the other hand, does, as Stern claims (pp. 81- 82), accord with the triadic model. But in light of my remarks in the text I can not agree with Stern that Nahmanides adopted this model from Maimonides. 4. The two places where Maimonides offers such symbolic explanations and actually refers to actions prescribed by the commandments as parables, namely, the sin offering and scapegoat sent into the wilderness (3:46), are the exceptions that prove the rule. Stern's discussion of this important issue strikes me as inconsistent (contrast p. 115 with p. 142). 5. This analogy, one should note, argues against Stern's claim that the gold and silver levels of the parable are addressed to the same audience. 363</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review belongs not to the perfection of the soul but to the welfare of the body. Thus both reasons are external, or "silver." There is one suggestive analogy between Maimonides' understanding of parables and his understanding of ta 'amei ha-misvot that Stern does not mention. In the Introduction to the Guide, Maimonides distinguishes between "two kinds of parables." In the first kind, "each word has a meaning"; in the second kind, "the parable as a whole indicates the whole of the intended meaning." Maimonides goes on to say that to confuse the two kinds and seek parabolic meanings for "all the details" of parables of the second kind "would result in extravagant fantasies." This calls to mind Maimonides' claim that not all the particulars of the commandments have causes, and that those who attempt "to find causes for something of these par- ticulars are stricken with a prolonged madness" (Guide 3:26). This possible anal- ogy, one should note, appears to contradict Stern's powerfully argued claim that Maimonides' distinction between the generalities and details of the command- ments should not be taken at face value, and that his statement that the particulars of the commandments have no causes simply means that "they have no causes known to us" (pp. 22-33). Whether, in Maimonides' view, one should distinguish between the general- ities and particulars of commandments, one certainly should distinguish between the generalities and particulars of Stern's book. Even if, as I have argued, many of Stern's general contentions are questionable, many of his more particular claims can stand on their own and are both thought-provoking and convincing. Since this review has focused on the generalities and not the particulars of Stern's book, it may give an overly negative impression of a rich and stimulating work. All read- ers interested in Maimonides should read Stern's book, with the Guide in hand, slowly, carefully, and, above all, critically. They will find his original and force- fully presented arguments enlightening, even-perhaps especially-when they disagree with him. Lawrence Kaplan McGill University Montreal</page></plain_text>
