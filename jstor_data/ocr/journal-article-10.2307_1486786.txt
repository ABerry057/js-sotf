For the Greeks, mankind becomes important only when it achieves an heroic aspect. This occurs when an individual is a leader or a major figure in great events, such as war or revolution, that change history or when his deeds or words challenge the gods. Memories of legends of gods and earlier heroes shape the decision-making and behavioral patterns of the classical Greek protagonists and their successors. In his obsession with the Christ story and the life of Shakespeare, isn't Stephen Dedalus in this Greek tradition? For the Jews, by contrast, human beings are the supreme beings on earth; they do not share space or focus with Gods or mythical heroes. Human life itself is not only sacred, but the way humans live and behave is an important subject for study. It follows that personal experiences and memories give shape to the lives of individual Jews. Thus the thought, feelings, and motives of Joyce's Irish Jewish hero, Leopold Bloom, are shaped by memories of his own and his family's past. But Leopold Bloom has never been bar-mitzvah or circumcised; nor is he the son of a Jewish mother, which by convention is the determinant of Jewish genealogy. Indeed, he has been baptized. Yet he is considered a Jew by everyone in Dublin, and his identity as an ostracized outsider and the victim of antisemitism is crucial to his characterization. By the time he wrote Ulysses in 1922, Joyce was fascinated with Jews. His embracing of Jews had to do with his rejection of Roman Catholicism. It also had to do with an incident when a man named Alfred Hunter, who Joyce thought was a Jew, befriended him during a drinking spree on June 22, 1904. As Neil R. Davison argues, Joyce identified with Bloom as an outcast in his own country: "To be born a Catholic Irishman, reject the Church, and then to call oneself the great Irish writer of his era appears to have been parallel in Joyce's mind to being uncircumcised, unkosher, agnostic, and still thinking of oneself as a Jew" (p. 201). Joyce sees Bloom, like himself, as a threatening presence to traditional Irish cultural prejudices: "Perceived as a Jew, Bloom will appear as an 'intrusion' into Irish culture and social discourse throughout [Ulysses}--the threatening presence of the Other that literally haunts the dominant culture" (p. 200). Like Joyce, Bloom is a pacifist and internationalist who considers himself a patriot; Bloom "is not a Zionist, but an Irish nationalist who is dogmatically pacifist, a prophet of peaceful coexistence--the 'opposite of hatred"' (p. 218). By</page><page sequence="3">434 BOOK REVIEWS having innocuous, good-hearted Bloom also be a Mason, Joyce debunked the widely accepted notion that the Masons were in treacherous collusion with the Jews, or that the Masons or the Jews were a conspiratorial threat to Ireland or Europe. Nor did Joyce have much use for the widely held nonsensical view that considered the Irish to be the lost tribes of Israel. In his Trieste years, Joyce was exposed to Jews, for Trieste had an influential Jewish population. Davison discusses persuasively the influence of Italo Svevo (Ettore Schmitz), whom Joyce met in Trieste: Schmitz also exemplified to Joyce how one could be non-practicing or perhaps even non-matrilineally Jewish (as in Bloom's case) and nevertheless perceive oneself as a Jew.... In many ways, Joyce's relationship with Schmitz completed his own search for a "good father"-a compassionate older man, indeed perhaps like Alfred Hunter. Joyce's perception of Schmitz as a "European" writer and attentive older friend may have fused with the image of Hunter as a kind, "good European." Because he perceived both of these men to be unequivocally Jewish, Joyce filtered his perceptions of them through those representations of "the Jew" he had been encountering in so many texts. (pp. 165-166) While Joyce was influenced by Otto Weininger's Sex and Character (1906) and Maurice Fishburg's The Jews: A Study of Race and Enlightenment (1911), he wanted to reject racial stereotypes: "Joyce's refusal to capitalize the word 'Jew' throughout Ulysses further indicates his distrust of the nineteenth-century concept of racial determination in the modem world. Joyce appears to consider 'Jewishness,' then, as neither religion nor race, but as an accepted self-image and personal commitment" (p. 232). Yet Joyce's Bloom, we need note, is not without Jewish racial stereotypes; he is guilt-ridden, family oriented, compulsively curious, womanly, passive, and worried about money. The chapters follow the order of Joyce's life prior to writing Ulysses. In the concluding pages of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce's narrator wrote: "I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use-silence, exile, and cunning" (p. 247); using "silence," "exile," and "cunning" as his structuring themes, Davison precedes a reading of Ulysses in chapter 8 with seven chapters that assiduously examine Joyce's biography and the possible Jewish contexts to which he responded. Davison touches upon every conceivable aspect of Joyce's knowledge of Jews; just</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 435 when we think he may have gone astray to touch on such subjects as Pissaro's or Degas's depictions of Jews, we realize that there might be an interesting connection. Davison's reading of Ulysses is perceptive but not strikingly original or always critically deft; yet it does focus our attention on the Jewish implications of the text. In his final chapter, he somewhat perfunctorily addresses the issue of Molly's Jewishness, but does he do enough with the reason for her interest in Jews-her own heritage? Lunita Laredo, her mother, has the name of a prominent Sephardic family in Gibraltar, and if she had a Jewish mother, Molly would be Jewish even if, as Davison claims, she considers herself an "Irish Dubliner of Spanish-Moroccan descent" (p. 237)--a description that hardly accounts for Molly's father, Major Tweedy. Put another way: while the last chapter regards Ulysses in terms of Bloom's Jewishness, it is a little like the mountain that gave birth to the mouse. Yet Davison does, at times, compellingly draw on the elaborate mustering of evidence that precedes: "Caught in his double-bind as an Irish Jew, and now even more apprehensive about nationalistic divisions, Bloom sadly bums the Agendath Netaim prospectus he had saved throughout his day. His lack of enthusiasm for Zionism again characterizes Jewish assimilationists of the era-an attitude Joyce encountered in his Jewish friends in both Trieste and Zurich" (p. 235). Readable and well researched, if on occasion relentless and slow moving, Davison's wide-ranging study exhaustively explores every conceivable Jewish source and context until we have a thorough work of scholarship that will set the standard for future students. I am a little skeptical of the claims that Joyce knew Nietzsche well. Calling Nietzsche "the prophet," Davison argues for the importance of Nietzsche's view of the Jews to Joyce: Nietzsche's discussion of contemporary Jewry laid the groundwork for Joyce's later belief that the Jews had developed an acute "shrewdness of character" (often pejoratively described by others as "cunning") to combat and endure their marginality.... [But] Christianity is to Nietzsche the final, degenerate flowering of the original Hebraic mentality.... Nietzsche's characterization of the Jews as "survivors" par excellence greatly influenced Joyce's perception of "the Jew." (pp. 114-116) Once in a while Davison indulges in LitCritSpeak: "Later on in life Joyce reified those feelings by including in Ulysses the younger Dodd's embarrassing plunge into the Liffey in 1911, which was rumored to have</page><page sequence="5">436 BOOK REVIEWS been an attempt at suicide" (p. 58), and he writes: "Bloom, however, deconstructs Stephen's myth" when he really means Bloom 'challenges' or 'undermines' Stephen's values (p. 233, emphasis added). Notwithstanding these semantic lulls, Davison's book is generally lucid, insightful, erudite, and persuasive.' Daniel R. Schwarz Cornell University Ithaca, N.Y. 1.
