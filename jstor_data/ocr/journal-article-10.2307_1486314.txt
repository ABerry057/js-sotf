<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORDECAI ZEV FEIERBERG AND THE REVERIES OF REDEMPTION* by ALAN MINTZ Columbia University I A shared phenomenon in the prose fiction of Western literatures in the late nineteenth century is the exploration of individual consciousness dis- sociated from collective existence. Although individual consciousness had been at the center of the fictional enterprise from the beginning, forming a first condition for the rise of the novel as genre, in the novel of sentiment and in the realistic novel the inner life of individual characters was largely produced dialectically from within the medium of social relations and social ideas. The description of an interior space deserving of attention for its own sake, a space generated by rules of its own which evince no clear or neces- sary connection to the larger social system, constitutes one of the points at which literature can be said to have become "modernist." Thereafter, one of the central thematic preoccupations of fiction remains the representation of consciousness itself: memory, reflection, and the manifold operations of the imagination, especially the act of writing. It is hard to imagine a cultural context in which this change came about more violently than it did in Hebrew fiction in Eastern Europe from the *The author wishes to thank the Lady Davis Fellowship Trust for making possible post- doctoral studies at the Hebrew University during which this research was done. 171</page><page sequence="2">172 ALAN MINTZ mid-nineteenth century to the First World War. At the level of personal biography, many of the best writers of the period passed from the matrix of traditional society to the anomic individuation of Middle- and West- European society, with the accompanying change from religious belief to some form of Western rationalism, in most cases within the space of only a few years. At the level of literary form, Hebrew fiction, its resources hitherto limited to picaresque, romantic, and satiric traditions, had to confront directly the new theme of the individual without the benefit of the mediation realism had provided the novel in England and France. The most astonishing change was at the level of language itself. Although the Hebrew literary tradition is not without its individualist expressions-the introspec- tive devotional poetry of the Andalusian poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries is the best example-the great expanse of productivity in the Hebrew language-Bible, Talmud, midrash, liturgical poetry, polemics, responsa, exegesis, philosophy-determines a kind of collective discourse in which the inner world of the individual finds no natural place. This is not to say that Western languages had a ready-made lexicon for this purpose, but it can be said that hundreds of years of secularization had in many cases neutralized religious and canonical connotations and rendered them usable for psychological meanings. In Hebrew there was hardly such a middle ground. When a writer extracted a phrase from the classical literature and pressed it into a new context in order to describe a state of consciousness, the figure lost none of the earmarks and resonance of its original source. Although such simultaneity of meaning was exploited fully for its ironic and parodic possibilities, it also underscored the precipitance of the transforma- tion: the meaning being affirmed is carried by a linguistic symbol identical to the meaning being negated. To make room for the representation of in- dividual consciousness, Hebrew writers not only had to hew out a space within the solid formation of classical sources but they had also to build their constructions with the very material they had quarried. Yet the literary history of the period from Abramovich to Gnessin can- not be read as the story of a simple progression along a continuum reaching from collective meanings embedded in traditional sources to descriptions of subjectivity emerging from existential situations. The movement is cross- hatched and blurred. From the outside, the newly ascendant nationalist movement made demands on writers to address the problems of the People as a whole, and from the inside, the neo-romantic current in Hebrew fiction took up for its own use the tales and exempla of a pre-individualist era. And</page><page sequence="3">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 173 when one adds the factor of differing degrees of exposure to European culture, the picture of the transition to individual consciousness becomes a complex grid on which authors must be located along several axes. One of the most interesting bodies of work in this connectiQn is the fic- tion of Mordecai Zev Feierberg (1871-1899). Feierberg's interest derives not only from his chronological location at the center of this period, at a point just before the great burst of fictional activity in the first decade of the next century, but also from the particularity of Feierberg's origins and in- tentions. Feierberg, to begin with, came almost entirely from within. Aside from a short visit to Warsaw, his life transpired in the town of Novograd- Volinsk rooted squarely within the traditional Jewish society of the northeast Ukraine. Educated in the local beit midrash (house of study) of the Chernobyl Hasidim, Feierberg not only never left for the yeshivot of the North but also never partook, or lived long enough to partake, in the up- rooted wanderings of others of his generation to Middle-European capitals and to Palestine. Moreover, although at the time of his death he was strug- gling with the rudiments of Russian and German grammars, Feierberg never in actuality learned European languages, and whatever knowledge of general culture he managed to acquire he had through the mediation of pop- ularizations, translations into Hebrew and Yiddish, and through the works of such cultural "importers" as Abad Ha'am and Berdichevsky. It is, in the end, just this provinciality which makes Feierberg compelling. The work of few other writers reveals in the same degree how the crisis of religion and values which convulsed traditional society resulted not only from contact with Western culture but also from an irremediable pressure working from within the society itself. To depict this crisis, furthermore, since he had little exposure to the psychological and philosophical literature of Europe, it was largely the resources of Jewish literature that Feierberg had available as a reservoir of serviceable images and metaphors. Driven by as desperate pres- sures as other writers yet provided with fewer cultural outlets, he was forced to develop more internally Jewish aesthetic solutions. Second, although Feierberg's religious crisis, like that of others, took the form of the sudden emergence of a highly individualized self-consciousness which was accompanied by a determination to save that individuality from suffocation by the community, as a writer Feierberg maintained a programmatic allegiance to the collective life of the traditional culture he was rejecting. Feierberg was of course not alone in this allegiance; many other Hebrew writers returned in art to the milieu they had revolted from in life.</page><page sequence="4">174 ALAN MINTZ Yet the self-consciousness of Feierberg's affirmation and his large degree of success in realizing it make him a special case. Feierberg believed that despite the apparent imaginative impoverishment of the ghetto (his term for the culture as a whole), the ghetto was possessed of richness and integrity of its own, and that it was the task of the Hebrew writer to penetrate the dis- couraging surfaces of ghetto life and trace "the most inward form of our outwardly manifested world" and thereby reveal the hidden soul of the Jew.' He took his own injunctions seriously, for although he had broken with the spirit of the ghetto he returned to that world as the proper locus of his artistic activity and argued vigorously against such writers as Ber- dichevsky who advocated the "liberation" of Hebrew fiction from those confines.2 The tension in Feierberg's writing between the exigencies of subjective consciousness and the sense of responsibility to the collective experience of the People-together with the measures he took to find adequate represen- tations of that tension-locate Feierberg at a special moment in Hebrew literary history. The aim of this paper is to understand that moment by at- tempting to reconstruct Feierberg's search for formal strategies to ap- propriate the interplay and antagonism between individual and collective consciousness. As a result of his experiments in the stories, I shall argue, Feierberg developed in Whither? the innovative literary structure of the "reverie," which succeeded in bringing about a short-lived integration of the two modes of consciousness. Although the examination of the dimen- sions and the functions of the reverie in Whither? is the principle intention here, I wish first to discuss, briefly and selectively, Feierberg's earlier experi- ments in the stories. II Radically different varieties of imaginative experience require radically different varieties of textual materials. To represent collective con- sciousness, Feierberg utilizes material drawn from the collective historical imagination of the People, namely, from the aggadic and legendary strand of the Hebrew literary tradition: Lamentations and the Song of Songs, the heroic narratives of the Former Prophets, midrashim, medieval exempla, 1.

The problematic of Feierberg's fiction resides in the fact that each modality of the imagination is by nature not only resistant to the other but also entails aesthetic dangers of the most serious kind. The problems raised by the attempt to treat individual consciousness concern how to avoid the dual dangers of engulfment and discontinuity. Such states of strong feel- ing as dread, bitterness and exaltation may submerge writing in a sea of sen- timent for which there is no adequate correlative; similarly, the associative circuitry of the mind as it switches from context to context vitiating its own constructions conduces to a discontinuity which may effectively cancel the possibility of the kind of consecutive narrative basic to fiction. The problem presented by aggadic, legendary material, on the other hand, concerns the problem of how to domesticate its inherent alienness, how to take a body of foreign material with its own referential integrity and make it serve the pur- poses of a new fiction-how, in short, to make it lead into the story rather than away from it. At the heart of aggadic material there is the strong logic of narration which has to be broken before consciousness can be as- similated, and conversely, at the heart of individual consciousness there is a lyric fragmentariness and circularity which has to be pulled together and straightened out before narrative can emerge. If the challenge in the treat- ment of aggadic material is to collapse aesthetic distance, then the challenge in the treatment of consciousness may be said to lie in the attempt to achieve it. Feierberg's six short stories, all written before the composition of Whither?, divide evenly along chronological lines into two groups. The early stories ("Yankev the Watchman," "Shadows," "A Spring Night") are set in lyric mode; they are evidence both of the power of Feierberg's attraction to the expressive individual imagination and of his difficulties in contending with its aesthetic demands. In the later group ("The Calf," "In the Evening," "The Amulet") Feierberg experiments with the creation and manipulation of narrative, either by interpolating it fully formed into a 3.

And only in the reverie-form in Whither? will an adequate vehicle for the integration of lyric and narrative be found. "Yankev the Watchman" (Ya'aqov ha-Shomer),4 Feierberg's first story, is ostensibly about the sufferings of the town watchman who at an early age had been pressed into the Czar's army as a "cantonist"; however, the com- plications of the narrative frame-the aging narrator recalls among the memories of his early childhood, stories about an unfortunate youth who was by then an old man-suggest that this is equally the story of the nar- rator as it is of Yankev himself. Although the Yankev-narrative is skillfully done in parts, focusing effectively on two or three imaginative events in the life of the dazed child, the story bogs down in the bathos of the narrator's rhetorical demands for justice for his case and in a process whereby Yankev himself is gradually dematerialized by the allegorical theme of cosmic exile (galut ha-shekhinah) his fate is made to symbolize. In the treatment of Yankev we feel Feierberg trying too hard with too heavy a hand to make his character embody the national experience, and instead, the result is to call attention away from Yankev and direct it toward the narrator and his overwrought exertions. The fact that the "I" of the narrator rather than the figure of Yankev is the hidden subject of the story is made clear in the prologue that begins this story as it does the two others of the early period, "The Shadows" and "A Spring Night." The prologue begins in the midst of an attack of existential bile in which the narrator reviews the spectacle of gratuitous suffering which has caused him a kind of spiritual death in which he questions the very worth of existence. Just as he approaches final despair, however, the graves of memory are flung open and the holy souls of the oppressed fly out, reawakening in the narrator the "strength to live on"; there, among the souls, as real as life, is the image of Yankev the watchman. The sense of life restored by the evocation of Yankev is not merely a rhetorical or sentimen- tal gesture: not only is the narrator saved from ultimate metaphysical nega- tion but the story itself is rescued from the bilious rantings of the narrator, and provided, in the form of an account of Yankev's life, with a reason for being told. The dangers inherent in consciousness bereft of narrative are given in the narrator's embittered image of the world as 4.

This dust which has been scattered and carried to the ends of the earth until not a grain again resembles the pebbles first placed on the pile. (p. 40, 146)5 The figure takes its power not only from the concrete image of infinite and irreversible disintegration, but also from its parodic relation to the verse in Jeremiah (23:29) "Is not my word . .. like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces," a verse the rabbis took as describing the wealth of exegetical pos- sibilities contained by each divinely uttered word, as well as the divine language at the origin of the tongues of the Seventy Nations.6 Feierberg deftly reverses the value but not the form of the activity in question: what in God's hands is the endless multiplication of meaning from a single source, in man's hands is meaning's endless breakdown and fragmentation. In the second half of the image the parody on a kabbalistic motif makes the point even more sharply: unlike the divine sparks which, though exiled from their divine source, remain recognizably divine and capable of one day being redeemed, the dust of human effort has been pulverized beyond recognition and scattered beyond recall. Thus in addition to reflecting on the futility of human endeavor, the conceit describes the risks involved in the writing of the story itself: the risks of self-cancellation run by wandering within the con- verging passageways of the mind. Instead of disappearing in Feierberg's next story "The Shadows" (ha- Selalim),7 those passageways become even more labyrinthine. The ran- corous meditations of the aging narrator of the previous tale are exchanged for the adolescent narrator's sweetened embrace of his self-imposed solitude. Hofni, on whom Feierberg hoped to base a series of first-person fictional memoirs, is a child of the ghetto at a time when the fabric of religious culture is fast unraveling.8 By night in the beit midrash, the beit 5.

Rocking over his Talmud folio as the magnified shadows sway "back and forth interweaving and overlapping" in response to his movements, Hofni ruminates on the moment the shadows first drew him to nocturnal study, on the swarm of doubts and desires he is certain never af- flicted his father's vigils in his own day, on the unconscious masses who never trouble themselves about study of the Law, on the great shadowy tomes in the surrounding bookcases, which, in a moment of visionary inten- sity, Hofni imagines turned into martyred Jews who are swept away weeping and groaning on rivers of blood. And so it goes as Hofni describes "the whirlwind of frighteningly bitter thoughts that lashed at my mind and cast a black cloud over me" (p. 56, 136). The whirlwind, alas, is not just in the lad's mind but on the page before us as well. Not only do reflections on the great themes of isolation, doubt, and theodicy have to be carried by fragmentary utterances whose rapid alternation and obscure transitions give us little to hold onto, but the vortex of thought pulls us down further and further into an embrace with death. Hofni's auto-erotic embrace of the shadow-world of martyrdom and meditation make it perfectly clear that the mind, left in isolation to populate its own world with images and figures, will fashion, like the crumbling beit midrash, its own tomb. Aware of the tendency of his story toward a death-embrace, Feierberg attempts in its second half to provide Hofni with some egress to the world in the form of two new characters. The first is Reb Shlomo, a poor but learned Jew who often comes to the beit midrash on winter nights to lose himself in study; but Reb Shlomo never in actuality appears in the story, remaining only an imagined presence in Hofni's mind and an occasion for the lad's reflections on the deficiency of his own devotion to study. The represen- tative of the real world who is finally ushered into the beit midrash is a poor village Jew who having lost his way in the snow has arrived hungry and cold after a long journey. Hofni leads him to the only place in town where people are still up at that hour, the social club of the local westernizers, where the youth and the visitor are treated with derision and condescension.9 This confrontation with the pervasive injustices of ghetto life shakes Hofni from his self-absorption, and, finding himself once again among the shadows of the night, he declares that his love for the darkness has passed, and that he is 9.

Although the next effort, "A Spring Night" (Leil 'Aviv),'0 does little to make good this declaration, Feierberg takes a determined step forward in a later group of stories ("The Calf," "In the Evening," and "The Amulet") simply by adjusting his narrator's age. In place of the fulminations of old age or the anguished self-absorption of adolescence, Feierberg returns in time to the mind of the child. By taking this simpler and more emotionally integrated point of view as a narrative origin, the writer can make his story re-experience the genesis of those states of consciousness which will later harden into enduring and overwrought metaphysical conditions. There is an economy here and a happy reduction of rhetoric which makes the pathos of the child's wonderment and dread far more acceptable to the reader than an old man's spleen or an adolescent's auto-erotic dilemmas. In "The Calf' (ha-'Egel)," for example, the outrage of a child over the slaughter of a favorite animal makes an effective and natural vehicle for such a theme as the arbitrary suffering of the innocent which was treated with considerable awkwardness in the early stories. A simple co-ordination of the death of the calf with the death of Hofni's innocence makes it clear enough that this cycle of death will not end when Hofni grows into maturity in the world of men and history. In the first part of "In the Evening" (ba-'Erev),12 written next, Feierberg describes with an even surer hand the impressions made upon the mind of the child by the milieu of the .beder: the pitiable anger of the rebbe and his assistants; the fantastic tales swapped by the boys when they are left alone between minhah and ma'ariv; the solitary trek home through mud and snow. However, when Hofni's mother submits to his coaxing and tells him a long tale concerning the struggle for the soul of a Jewish child stolen in infancy from his parents by a Polish landowner, Feierberg's story takes off in an entirely new direction. In its "flawless command of narrative pace and mood"'3 the story introduces a sense of movement entirely unattested in his earlier prose. Shuttled across an expanse of years or held hovering over a single scene, the reader knows he is in the grip of a narrator who has dis- covered how to produce and control the literary illusion of motion and who, one suspects, will not easily do without it. This is a world far different from 10. First appeared in Luab 'Abi'asaf, 1897-98; Halkin, pp. 65-71; Kitvei, pp. 143-46. 11.

Moreover, in reworking and combining elements from three separate Hasidic narratives, as S. Werses has shown,'4 Feierberg demonstrates his ability successfully to appropriate legendary materials for his own imaginative purposes-here to represent the struggle between the ghetto and the hostile but alluring world outside-while at the same time maintaining the literary integrity of the materials themselves. The tale thus shows Feierberg not only breaking through to narration but also learning how to neutralize the foreignness of material arising from the col- lective rather than individual imagination. Beyond the separate gains of each half of the story, there remains the question of the connection between two very different kinds of fictional materials, between a sketch of hbeder life and a wonder tale. It can, on the one hand, be argued that the two are integrated by the common theme of in- itiation. The story takes place on the day Hofni is being graduated from the lower tiers of the heder to the ranks of the older boys who stay on to study at night. The pride which suffuses the moment, however, is disturbed by the experience of listening to his mother's tale, a tale which is frightening not only because it describes the wiles Satan uses to seduce boys away from Judaism but also because of the very fact that the story is left without an ending: the ultimate fate of the stolen child's soul is left for another night's telling. This subversive indeterminacy turns Hofni's innocent celebration of maturity into an initiation of another kind, a foretaste of the world of un- remitting temptation and struggle which will soon enough be his. Whereas loss of innocence in "The Calf" resulted from the anguish of direct ex- perience, it should be noted that in "In the Evening" its loss results, more subversively, from the experience of narration itself. Yet no matter how well-wrought this connection, it remains only a thematic bond; the divergent materials Feierberg was working with could be related by apposition and analogy alone. The "peg" the beder story provides for the telling of the tale is wobbly in the extreme, and once begun, the tale ends by completely consuming its narrative framework. To make this point, however, is not necessarily to devalue the story, but to indicate that the con- siderable achievement of "In the Evening" is secured at a price: in order to perfect his facility with narrative it was first necessary for Feierberg to split it from consciousness and cultivate it separately in its own autonomous con- text. Considering his success with the tale-form, Feierberg might well have 14. Werses, Sippur ve-Shorsho, pp. 94ff.</page><page sequence="11">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 181 continued in that direction; but something essential and compelling about the kind of immediate individual consciousness depicted in the early stories forced him, whatever the aesthetic risks, to return to consciousness as a fic- tional medium into which narrative might be integrated rather than merely implanted. Before Feierberg proceeded to the work in which he would attempt such an integration, he exacted in his last story "The Amulet" (ha-Qame'a)"5 the maximum amount of serviceability from the conventions of the short-story before putting the genre aside for the novella. The stories, we have seen, are characteristically divided into two moments, marked by two very diffe'rent compositional textures: a solitary imaginative experience followed by the in- trusion, in various forms, of the "real" historical experience of the People as a whole. The ratio of emphasis, we also noted, shifts from story to story: whereas in "The Shadows" the mistreatment of the poor Jew is absorbed by the tortuous historiosophical speculations of the adolescent narrator, the vivid but thin impressions of Hofni's beder experiences in "In the Evening" are subsumed by the expanding vistas of the tale of theft and struggle. By returning to the treatment of consciousness in "The Amulet," Feierberg not only draws these two moments into a tight symmetry but also perfects the analogical bond between them. At the beginning of the story Hofni awakes in the middle of the night seized by the kind of mortifying nameless dread which makes it seem as if his mind had fully grasped the portentous meaning of the tale he had been put to bed with in the previous story. Unable to fall asleep, Hofni experiences a momentary voiding of consciousness during which, not knowing whether he is asleep or awake and unable to recognize his surroundings, he is left to the terrors of pure sensation. Although slowly the sideboard and his parents' bed once again become familiar, unlike Adam at the Creation, he cannot match names with things, and he is left so utterly without will that he cannot bring himself to take his arms out from under the coverlet to perform the ablutions that would make it possible to recite the Shema' and thus release himself from this state. Again the next night Hofni awakes in a fright, this time from a dream about the martyrs of the Chmielnicki era based on a story told him by a comrade concerning a beder class, teachers and students, who had offered their throats en masse to the Cossacks' knives. Hofni's vigils of dread signify the dual modalities- void and nightmare-which are left the individual imagination after it has been disabused of its childhood elan by exposure to the historical drama of 15.

This exposure, which the imagination first seeks as a deliverance from imprisonment within itself, becomes the same experience which is responsible for the reduction and demonization of the mind's imaginative powers. The irony of the story's second half emerges from the changing valuation of Hofni's dread: what begins as motiveless childhood silliness ends by becoming a symbol for the spiritual situation of the entire generation. The father's tirade about the decline of Hasidism and the spiritual orphaning of the generation is reinforced by the kabb,alist to whom Hofni is brought for counseling. In the wake of the Messiah's failure to come, the holy man ex- plains, Jews have lost "the power of expectance.. . the inner mind has shrunk to nothing.. . the Shekhinah refuses to descend.. . and because holiness is departed and left a vacuum behind, Samael has spread his nets and goes forth to stalk souls" (p. 117, 63). As the two men struggle to apply Lurianic theology to the present crisis of the People, which they perceive as unrelated to the inconsequential fears of a small child, the reader who is alive to the analogical method of the story knows that the historical situa- tion the men describe is nothing other than that of Hofni's mind as it is first voided and then invaded by nightmare. Despite refinements in the analogical method, the thematic opposition of individual to collective and the formal opposition of consciousness to narrative still have to be represented separately and consecutively. It will be the achievement of Whither? to make the two into one: not only to originate a compositional form which can incorporate the two sets of thematic and formal elements into a single, simultaneous imaginative event, but also to relate these events dynamically one to the other and thereby construct the larger story of the novella. III On the question of the "achievement" of Whither? (Le'an?),'6 there has actually been little agreement in previous critical argument. It is generally agreed that the novella succeeds in describing how the crisis of faith which beset the generation of the nineties was produced from within Judaism rather than from without, as had often been the case in the less tortured con- versions of the sixties and seventies."

In less thematic matters, however, there is less apprecia- tion. The last third of the book, from Nahman's betrothal to his proto- Zionistic speech, is thought by many to be an aesthetic failure. The first two- thirds, characterized by Nahman's visions, meditations and dreams, are generally taken to be impressive in their lyrical impact but highly deficient in their abandonment to emotive expression and visionary origination for which no adequate forms are established. J. H. Brenner put the case most bluntly when he said that Whither? is only about a "young Jew with a sen- sitive heart whose birth-thoughts and birth-pangs are painful to him and who comes before us to pour out his soul."'8 J. Fichman, in remarking on the promise rather than the maturity of the work, put the case most sym- pathetically when he said that "more than constituting a literary work, [Whither?] expresses the thirst for one,"'9 and I. Rabinowitz most theoretically, in claiming that Feierberg's powers as an artist were simply not strong enough to prevent his giving way to the shadow-world of the overwhelming erotic and demonic forces he summoned up.20 Since the visionary element called into question here does in fact constitute the basic fabric of the work, any critical effort on behalf of Whither?, such as the one I wish now to present, must therefore make its case on these terms also. Far from being an amorphous mass of expression, the visionary materials of Whither?, I would argue, are organized into a series of tightly designed units which move the meaning of the story in successful if un- conventional ways. Although there are several different varieties of imaginative materials from which Whither? is composed-dreams, parables, monologues, quotations, dramatized reasonings21-the work's unique and central narrative unit is one I wish to call the "reverie."22 A reverie is a kind 18.

The term "reverie" was given currency in critical discourse by Gaston Bachelard, throughout his career and most synthetically in his late work La podtique de la reverie (Paris, 1961). (On this see Mary Ann Caws, Surrealism and the Literary Imagination [The Hague, 1966].) Bachelard used the term phenomenologically to describe the pleasures of the artistic imagination as it contemplates natural objects. My use of "reverie" to describe a unified series of imaginative moments not within the mind of the artist but within the finished work of art re- tains only a few similarities with Bachelard's usage.

The reverie is not properly speaking a dream, because it takes place in a waking state, nor is it a soliloquy or a monologue, because it is neither spoken aloud nor spoken before anyone; nor is it entirely a vision, because it contains many elements of meditation and reflective reasoning. In Whither? the reverie takes the form of a series of imaginative movements which begin as a meditation on a present object or task and move toward a fantasy of heroism or martyrdom, which in turn evokes threatening questions of es- chatology and theodicy which finally burst the reverie and return Nahman to the unredeemed present. These reveries, of which there are about a dozen in the first two-thirds of Whither?, are the most significant among the nar- rative units of the work. One would be hard pressed to find here any of the ordinary "scenes" from which fiction is usually constructed: dramatized conversation, social exchanges or confrontations, changes in external condi- tions which affect the hero's choices. The only real events in Whither? take place within consciousness, and it is largely through the experience of such events of consciousness that the narrative develops. The changes Nahman undergoes result from his imaginative experience within the reverie: some option is closed and the remaining ones seized upon in the next reverie with renewed desperation. By thus situating narrative within consciousness, Feierberg was able to integrate the two modalities of imagination whose stubbornly separate careers had limited the possibilities of his earlier work. Before proceeding further I wish to make clear that despite my intention to deal with Whither? from the point of view of the reverie, I am aware of the existence in the novella of several other kinds of technical strategies. Most striking in this connection is the fact that the novella begins (although the device is quickly abandoned) in an entirely different mode, as a tale told about Nahman by a mother of a Hofni-like child. At the center of the work stands the great speech of Nahman's father, which is a monologue rather than a reverie. And from the Ninth of Ab scenes and forward, roughly the last third of the book, the narrative describes Nahman's meditations rather than attempting, as in the case of the reverie, to constitute them. These sec- tions and their methods, however, are similar to those in the works of many other writers of the period, and in Whither? they are simply not the most successful parts of the book. I shall certainly attempt to show how the reverie is related to the father's monologue and why the reverie form disap- pears in the closing sections of the novella, but I choose to stay close to the reverie as a subject because it is Feierberg's major innovation and a signifi- cant aesthetic solution to the dillemmas of the age.</page><page sequence="15">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 185 I wish to begin with a synchronic reading of one reverie and then proceed to a diachronic analysis of each of the reverie's constituent ele- ments. The section I quote from comes near the beginning of the novella. 1 A sudden ray of light entered from the next room. Through the slightly opened door he saw his father sit down on the floor in a corner. [ ... ] A moment pas- sed and he could be heard as he began to chant the midnight vigil in a slow, drear voice. [... ] Nahman eased himself down off his bed and tiptoed to the door to see his father more closely. It was a fearful, an awesomely holy scene. The plaintive chant bore into the recesses of his heart and soul-"How long will there be mourning in Zion and weeping in Jerusalem?"-The old man was secretly weeping. Tear after tear rolled down his white beard; "I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, they shall never hold their peace day 10 nor night."/-He thought of the stories about Jerusalem's walls that he had heard from Jews who had been there. In his mind's eye he saw two large teardrops fall from the Wailing Wall, while a fox ran stealthily in and out of its breaches. He stood among the ruins by the holy wall and watched the crowds of Jews as they wept out loud and threw themselves on the ground. Here were the remnants of Jerusalem's towers, from a crumbled mound of which he heard a voice cry out: "Woe to the father who has sent his children into exile and woe to the children who are banished from their father's table!" A veil of darkness covered Jerusalem. The city lay in mourning. Before a cave by one of its gates sat the aging King David and played a frightfully sad and poignant 20 tune upon his harp. Near him an armed Arab stood guarding the city, his spear in one hand and his sword on his hip. High, far away the heavens split open and there was God himself sitting on His throne and looking down on the world that served as His footstool. Here was Jerusalem lying desolate. /The throne rocked back and forth, and two enormous tears hurtled to the bottom of the great sea. Then all the holy souls who had martyred themselves in His name came forth from paradise surrounded by fire, while a river of blood flowed before them. Their bodies were beaten and torn; their bony hands were held high and in them were the scraps of parchment from the Torah scrolls they had saved from the foe. Before the mercy seat they 30 flung themselves down, but an awesome voice called out to them from above: "Return to your place of rest, ye holy souls, the time has not yet come!" Then Mother Rachel too fell upon the throne with a heartrending wail, and the holy fathers prostrated themselves at its feet with a terrible cry ... /But the long bitter exile was not yet over. Jerusalem was burned to ashes. The land of Israel lay waste. The Shekhinah was in exile, and the Jews lay scattered and dis- persed among the nations. Satan reigned victorious. Samael held sway over all. Mikhael, the angel of Israel, his father had told him, lay bound in chains. Man was ruled by his passions and could not worship God. /Ah, when would</page><page sequence="16">186 ALAN MINTZ the Messiah come? He must come. No, he must be brought. The Messiah 40 wouldn't come by himself, his father had said. Each generation must bring him. And yet so many had tried! Joseph de la Reina. The blessed Ari. The Baal Shem Tov. They couldn't bring him because the time hadn't come. But perhaps it now had. It was time to try again. The Messiah must be brought. He must, no matter what! From that night on-so he remembered-his childhood innocence and animal spirits were taken from him. It was then that he first came to realize that life was a dreadful contest in which he was condemned to struggle and toil for as long as he lived without ever knowing whether he was winning or not. (pp. 134-37, 138-39, 73-75, 76) The reverie consists of five characteristic moments, whose transitions I have marked in the text with a slash line. The first moment (lines 1-10) is the setting. Through the crack in the bedroom door Nahman glimpses his father in the outer room sitting on the ground and weeping over Jerusalem in the tiqqun hasot prayer, and drawn by the plaintiveness of the chant, he comes to the door to observe him. The reverie proper (lines 10-23) opens with a meditation, which begins when Nahman's observation of his weeping father gives rise to his own thoughts about Jerusalem destroyed. This is the threshold at which con- templation of the external object (the ostensible occasion for the reverie) is left behind for independent imaginative origination. Nahman paints a tableau of Jerusalem's ruins with colors taken from a range of traditional sources (Lamentations, Lamentations Rabbah, Talmud Berakhot, and others); here the Western Wall with its weeping Jews and the heavenly voice crying out "Woe!" and there King David in the shadow of the armed Arab, with God on his throne above. The tableau exists on a static plane as if Nahman's mind was filling the corners of a canvas; and although the sense is conventionally tragic, very much what we would expect to be the associa- tions of an imaginative beder boy, it nonetheless betrays a kind of unex- pected and unspoken delight in the act of conjuring up and filling out a scene. The scene erupts in line 24 with the rocking of the divine throne and the release of two great tears of mercy. The martyred souls, who have waited for eras for such a sign of God's intention to bring the redemption, rush up from paradise on a river of blood and fling their tortured bodies in supplica-</page><page sequence="17">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 187 tion before the Almighty. The divine tears, however, have been a sign only of interim compassion and not of ultimate deliverance, and despite the wail- ing intercession of Mother Rachel and the patriarchs, the battered souls are told to return below, for the end has not yet come. In this moment of vision, the static plane of the preceding tableau is shattered by the heavenward flight of the driven souls which describes an infinite chasm between the mercy seat and the great sea below. The violently propelled movements of this scene, with its desperate rush toward the opening of redemption, spring from sources very different from the child's self-gratifying fancy, sources closer in origin to the threatening and chaotic unconscious imagination. In the fourth moment (lines 33-38), the historical moment, the deflated tone carried by the repeated hammering rhythm of facts reflects the im- mobilizing recognition that nothing at all has changed and that the "long, bitter exile" remains in force. The unrelenting pressure of the indefinite pre- sent tense gives the sense that the destruction has happened all over again and that the visionary evocation of a redemptive opening has only thrust the world deeper into the hands of demonic forces. The last moment, divided into two parts, returns to the present and then proceeds to describe Nahman's response to the experience he has just un- dergone. In the first part (lines 38-44) the intractable hold of the un- redeemed present weakens in the face of speculations about the Messiah. The despirited aftermath of visionary intensity yields to a determined voice which declares that the Messiah must be brought; the voice gains in authority as it first admits perplexity and speculates on why the great saints of the past have failed, and then asserts that the time is at last at hand, and finally cries out its unconditional commitment to the task. This section is not only a victory over the paralyzing recognitions of the previous one but is also an escape from the present into the future, a future created by an imagination which has inserted itself at the center of the historical drama. Although the second part of the last moment (lines 45-48) is not part of the reverie proper and here follows a dream I have left out, it nonetheless in- dicates the completed pattern. After the great imaginative event, the interior space of Nahman's mind is left behind, and the decisive changes which have resulted from the reverie are reported in the discursive voice of the narrator. Here, as is the case following most of the reveries, we are told of the price Nahman has had to pay for the experience. The vision of redemption and unredemption with its concluding pledge to bring the Messiah has disabused Nahman of his "childhood innocence and animal spirits" and placed him directly into "the dreadful contest" for the deliverance of the world.</page><page sequence="18">188 ALAN MINTZ IV Among the general features of the reverie it should be first pointed out that the reverie transpires entirely within the imagination, and it is through the operation of successive varieties of the imagination that the effective se- quence of movements is produced. The reverie begins with Nahman's fascination in the act of observing his father, which in turn gives rise to a pleasurable pictorial meditation concerning the awesome subject of his father's prayers. However, the scene Nahman has conjured up, sentimental and precious in conception, serves almost in spite of itself to trigger a quite different kind of force. An involuntary imaginative impulse surges to the surface and transforms passive rumination into violent vision. When the momentum of vision is then blocked by God's edict, Nahman's mind is returned, not to the ingenuous fascination of the outset, but to a bitter con- sciousness of the unredeemed state of the world. When Nahman regains control of his mind it is to draw a new map of the future, this time a fantasy of militant action. One of the central moments in this sequence is the one in which the involuntary imagination wrenches control from Nahman's in- dulgent fantasizing, a moment which signals in substantive terms the shift from an authorized, pious picture of Jerusalem destroyed to an un- authorized vision of a rebellious attempt to coerce the end. The reverie describes a great unclosed circle. From its starting point in present observation, Nahman's mind rises to hover in the timeless past of the People and then rushes forward toward a future beyond history; the failure of redemption returns Nahman to the present, but it is not the pre- sent he left: the spontaneous fascination of childhood has been exchanged for ineradicable historical awareness. The reverie has picked Nahman up and sent him back toward the indefinite past and then forward toward the in- finite future and has finally set him down at a place which is slightly but significantly distant from his point of departure. It is this small breach, dur- ing which options are closed and others opened, which advances the story of Nahman's progress toward apostasy; it is an advance which takes place dur- ing and as a result of Nahman's great imaginative flight. Whither?, it may therefore be said, unfolds on two narrative planes and at two narrative rhythms: the cosmic reaches of the reveries with their strong circular move- ments and the gradual change of Nahman's soul as it alters by small linear steps. The very presence of both a "cosmic" and an individual meaning in this</page><page sequence="19">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 189 passage is an important aspect of Feierberg's achievement in Whither? The voice which cries out from the ruins "Woe to the father who has sent his children into exile and woe to the children who are banished from their father's table!" (lines 16-17) surely bewails the catastrophic pain of both the exiled Jewish people and their abandoned God, but it also bewails the equal- ly catastrophic pain of both Nahman, who is about to descend into the long exile of apostasy, and his father, who is about to be afflicted with an aban- donment which he himself, like God, has decreed. The exile of the Jewish People from God and Nahman from his father (and he from his God) repre- sent, however, only the collective and individual dimensions of the tragedy; the dimension which may be said to be truly cosmic is the exile of God from Himself, of the transcendent 'Ein Sof from the immanent Shekhinah-the very theme of the tiqqun hbasot prayer. Individual, collective, cosmic-the dimensions of exile proliferate and interpenetrate: through the crack in the door Nahman, the son, contemplates the exile of the People as he watches his father bewail the exile of the Father from Himself. Feierberg succeeded in creating a fiction which, as Baruch Kurzweil has written, "collapsed the barriers between subject and object,"23 between the fate of the writer, his community and their God. One cannot read Feierberg's novella without being struck by the sense of longing which permeates its pages. Every object Nahman comes in contact with serves as a touchstone of desire, as an occasion for extended flights of longing in the direction of unseen worlds. Nahman, in fact, can almost be said to have no "character" or "self" in conventional fictional terms but to appear before us solely as a point of desire whose existence is defined not by what it has but by what it longs for. The control and orchestration of this ef- fulgence of desire is one of the functions of the reveries of Whither?. The reverie is a kind of neutral field whose positive and negative terminals are given changing designations. Whatever the desire, to begin with, certain features are always in play; imaginatively there is always a negative pole of distraction which longs for visionary fullness; metahistorically, a pole of un- redemption which longs for redemption; and textually, the constricted world of the Talmud which longs for the free flight of aggadah. As the nar- rative progresses, the specific poles of presence and absence undergo trans- formations; passive fantasy versus the power of esoteric knowledge; the pre- sent which is poor in opportunitites for dramatic self-sacrifice versus the pas- 23. Kurzweil, Sijrutenu ha-Iadashah, p. 150.</page><page sequence="20">190 ALAN MINTZ sion of historical martyrdom; God's apparent concealment from the world versus his intimate rapport with Israel in the exegesis of the Song of Songs. Feierberg's generation, it has been said often enough, was rent by terrible conflicts between the ghetto and the world, the sacred and the secular, the community and the individual, the squalor of the present and the hypostasized glory of the past. In the reverie, with its flexible field of desire, Feierberg found a vehicle capable of representing the dimensions and vicis- situdes of the conflicts of an entire generation. Desire which can never be fulfilled is the propulsive force behind verbal production which can never be at rest. The unrelenting movement of the imagination as it streams across the poles of the reverie is one of the most characteristic features of Feierberg's mature style. The reverie's appropria- tion of narrative energy is, of course, one of the principle sources of this movement. The vision of redemption first at hand and then deferred, for ex- ample, is a miniature narrative whose breathless progression from event to event recalls the accomplishments of the interpolated tale in "In the Evening." Whereas in the latter case, however, such movement is carried by a self-contained story, in Whither? the same sense of movement has been moved inside the mind and made to serve as part of a larger imaginative event. A less obvious form of movement, one usually present in the non- visionary moments of the reverie, is produced by a progression, not of events, but of logical or rhetorical statements. Nahman's speculations about the Messiah (lines 38-44 above), for example, are actually a series of asser- tions and refutations, a fact which is easy to see once they are rearranged on the page: Ah, when would the Messiah come? He must come. No, he must be brought. Each generation must bring him. And yet so many had tried! They couldn't bring him because the time hadn't come. But perhaps it now had. It was time to try again.</page><page sequence="21">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 191 The movement here is two-directional. In Hofni's mind there is an un- hesitating progression from syllogism to syllogism, yet in the mind of the reader there is actually an oscillation between the syllogistic and hortatory, between truths deduced from historical evidence (i.e., from the failure of redemption) and proclamations of the states of reality which "must" (read: "should") come into being. Feierberg's ability to produce both a rhetorical movement and an ironic awareness of its speciousness represents a signifi- cant disciplining of the kind of amorphous rumination which swamped his earlier prose. V As important to Whither? as the circuit of the imagination within each reverie is its movement from one reverie to the next. This movement provides a significant instance of the interplay of imagination and ideology, for as each episode concludes with a newly arrived at theological- historiosophical position, it decisively conditions the imaginative economy of the next one. I wish to follow this change through a discussion of each of the five moments of the reverie in the central episodes of the novella. In order to take the passage discussed above as a common point of departure, I am putting aside two less developed reveries which precede it (pp. 177-78, 101-2 and 186, 106-7). The seven core reveries and their subjects are as fol- lows: Ri-The midnight vigil (pp. 134-37, 73-75) R2-Bringing the Messiah (pp. 139-47, 76-81) R3-Martyrdom (pp. 149-51, 83-84) R4-Alter the idler (pp. 163-65, 93) Rs-Jephthah's daughter (pp. 165-66, 94) R6-The Song of Songs and the allegory of the scholars (pp. 167-69, 95-96) R7-Gersonides and apostasy (pp. 172-73, 98-99). The setting for the reverie, to begin with, moves through three symbolic sites: from the home, to nature, and finally to the beit midrash. After the midnight vigil Nahman leaves the intimate space of his father's house and his father's authority for a craggy ledge overlooking the woods and streams at the edge of the town (R2). Here pheasants call, streams whisper, leaves stir-this is a zone of imaginative freedom where, as in Bialik's "The Pool" (ha-Berekhah), "another language" (safah 'ahberet) from that of the beder</page><page sequence="22">192 ALAN MINTZ and the market place is spoken. Although this would seem like the proper place for Nahman to fulfill his vow to bring the Messiah, his repeated efforts fail, and when he approaches the craggy ledge two years later (R3) it has become merely a touchstone of memory, a "journal" of the naive days when "his will grew bold and expansive" and sought to "soar from the ground to challenge and master all things." The subsequent removal of the remainder of the reveries to the beit midrash signifies confinement in a space in which the originating powers of the imagination are even more severely qualified. The great volumes of Talmud commentaries which surround him there re- mind Nahman of the authority of the past and of his responsibility to it rather than to himself, and the decrepitness of both the building and its sole other inhabitant, Alter the idler, remind Nahman that by remaining in the beit midrash, rather than "living," he is being buried alive. It is the dis- closure of the beit midrash as a tomb which finally supplies the compulsion for Nahman's ambiguous flight to freedom. The meditation, the second moment of the reverie, is usually begun as an unauthorized alternative to a more normative activity. Nahman's observa- tion of his father reciting the tiqqun basot (RI) is an avoidance of going to sleep as he should; the visionary adventures at the craggy ledge are an escape from the prosaic world of the hbeder (R2, R3); and the reveries in the beit midrash are all in one form or another begun as an illicit glance upward from the Talmud folio Nahman should be studying. Unlike the rich tableau of Jerusalem destroyed, later meditations tend toward greater discursiveness and toward verbal patterns imitative of the kind of processes of conjecture and ratiocination which are evoked by experiences of wonderment and fascination. Although, for example, the first reverie at the craggy ledge (R2) begins with a sword-waving fantasy of heroic action, Nahman soon realizes that despite his bluster he has no real idea of how to bring the Messiah, and he then passes over to a meditation on the holy books he has heard spoken of and the esoteric wisdom they are supposed to divulge to those who know how to read them. When he returns to the ledge after the failure of his mes- sianic mission (R3), he is enveloped first in memories of his own failed aspirations and then in reflections on the perennial suffering which has resulted from the deferrals of the past. A significant shift between the early reveries and Nahman's later enclosure in the beit midrash is brought about by the great monologue of Nahman's father which stands at the center of the novella. Its theme is not the heroic individual and his power to bring redemption but the isolated</page><page sequence="23">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 193 soldier who must endure every hardship just to maintain his place in God's army. In the image of the soldier there is no moral glamor, no romantic authority, no promise of secret knowledge, and even no enviable martyr- dom; in a fallen generation such as Nahman's there is only dread, tempta- tion, and isolation as rewards for fighting God's fight. The fact that the monologue is a speech and not a reverie is significant, because its very pur- pose is to qualify radically the sense of potency which has until now sur- rounded Nahman's imaginative flights. Implied in both Nahman's reveries and his father's speech, to be sure, is a distance which intervenes between subject and object; but whereas in the case of the reverie it is a distance of desire filled by imagination, in the father's case it is a distance of resistance filled by dogged struggle. The father's reproach thus elaborates a set of parallel distances with different polarities (Good Impulse/Evil Impulse, qelippah/tokh) which counters and eventually consumes the world of Nahman's desires. The difficulty Nahman experiences in achieving any kind of imaginative flight when he is left alone by his father in the beit midrash (R4) indicates the deep inroads the monologue has indeed made in the free operation of Nahman's imaginative faculties: "a swarm of confused memories swept through his mind; he was ridden by fragments of feeling that came from and led to nowhere" (p. 164, 93). To escape this debilitating confusion Nahman searches for some textual foothold for the imagination other than the Talmud, which has come to symbolize his captivity, and he finds it first among the vital primitive tales of the Former Prophets (Rs) and then among the enchanting allegories of the midrash to the Song of Songs (R6). But when these beautiful legends are involuntarily transferred in his mind to tales of bloodshed and victimization, Nahman turns from myth to philosophical speculation as a subject of meditation (R7). Aware for the first time that the history of Jewish thought has been marked not by uniformity but by violent controversy and mutual accusation, Nahman meditates with special pathos in the moments before his own heresy on the example of Ger- sonides, whose attractive rationalist doctrine of prophecy has been declared by some authorities a flat denial of revelation. In the moment of vision at the center of the reveries the controlled cerebral speculation of the meditation is usurped by an involuntary imaginative force which creates its own mythos. This mythos is characterized by the same sense of movement associated with narrative, and like Feierberg's previous use of narrative it amplifies and refashions aggadic</page><page sequence="24">194 ALAN MINTZ material. The thematic movement here is from redemption to martyrdom and then from the denial of martyrdom finally to apostasy. Although the souls which rushed up from under the divine mercy seat to demand redemp- tion have been suppressed (RI), Nahman is left nonetheless with a convic- tion of the possibility of forcing the end, and at the craggy ledge (R2) he crosses over from his theosophical meditation on the existence of secret knowledge to a theurgical vision of the magical power invested in the manipulation of Hebrew letters, a power which can "command all the world and bid them to perform his will." When Nahman returns to the ledge after his efforts have come to nothing, he transfers his visionary energy from the glory of the redemption-to-come to the pathos-and also the glory-of the martyrdom of the past, recalling a story from the midrash about the magnificent children of Jerusalem, those tender holy babes. Before him stretched the great camp of four hundred boys and girls. They stood on the bank of the broad river contemplating their captive fate; headlong they hurled themselves into the water .... His spirit moved freely through the wondrous places where the little heroes had passed.... (p. 151, 84) The delicious enviability so palpable in this description is decisively squashed by the father's assertion that being a hero in the new generation re- quires a sacrifice far more chilling and far less dramatic. Since this is a fate which Nahman cannot face directly, he responds by conjuring up visions of sacrifice which are even more desperately romantic. Recalling the tears he had recently shed over the story in the Book of Judges about Jephthah and his daughter, his mind quickens and is soon lost in an extended evocation of that tragic story of mistiming and sacrifice, an evocation which focuses with special pathos on the datighter's valiant acceptance of her fate, in exchange for which she asks only two months in which to wander in the mountains with her companions to bewail her virginity. Next when Nahman manages to force his mind back to the open folio of Bava Qamma long enough to "break" a difficult passage, he begins to revel in the pleasures and pathos of Jewish learning (R6) and he is soon engrossed in an extended re-evocation of the allegorical interpretation of the Song of Songs, in which the beloved becomes the Daughter of Israel and the vineyards she wanders through the houses of study and the masters of the Law. However, this denial can be perpetuated no longer, and as he meditates on his own attraction to the suspect teachings of Gersonides (R7), Nahman is terrified by the very idea of</page><page sequence="25">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 195 heresy, the idea that because of "one single thought he stood to lose all, even his share in the world to come." He tries desperately to suppress these thoughts, but an inner voice makes itself heard despite his efforts. "You fool!," it mocks, "What can you lose? What makes you think that there's a world to come at all? If the Torah doesn't come from God, then neither does anything else, so what is there to be lost?" (p. 173, 98). In his depiction of Nahman's moment of apostasy as the sudden articulation of a suppressed voice, Feierberg makes clear what has been implicit all along: the roots of heresy lie in the revolt of the imagination, and when the mass of doubts and reasoning reaches a point where faith is possible no longer, the break comes not as a final logical step but, like conversion, as an imaginative leap. In no reverie can the visionary moment be sustained for long before it is brought up short by the contradictions of Jewish history. In the experience of rupture is the beginning of the fourth, historical moment of the reverie. In some instances the recognition is expressed in hushed, dramatic tones as in the picture of redoubled exile and desolation in the lines following the failure of redemption in the tiqqun basot episode; however, Feierberg is also effective when he shows, as in the case of Nahman's messianic reverie (R7), how vision breaks down in the midst of the difficulties of day-to-day life: the constant solicitations of the Evil Impulse, the temptation to go swimming in the river with the other boys on Friday afternoon; the petty provocations of schoolmates at prayers. In Nahman's second reverie at the craggy ledge (R3) the reality principle is introduced by a kind of natural speculative faculty reacting to the idyllic vision of mass martyrdom. The vision leads to a heavenward gaze at the stars, which Nahman imagines to have twinkled just as brightly and impersonally on the night of that aweful sacrifice. He is seized by an unwished-for rush of thoughts: "Ah, who knew what went on above! Perhaps it was all just a joke. The Bible mocked the customs of the gentiles, but might not the gentiles have a book that mocked the customs of the Jews?" And thus a conjecture about the relativism of historical destinies leads directly to the thought, entertained for the first time, of the absurdity of Jewish history. When left alone in the beit midrash after his father's speech (R4), Nahman's vague ruminations about the boredom of Talmud study and the decrepitness of the beit midrash are suddenly catalyzed by a glance at Alter the idler which prompts the realization that in contrast to his father's inflated visions of the soldier of God, this man picking at his beard and rocking back and forth in a mindless trance represents in reality what it means to be a model soldier at this moment in Jewish life. As he glides with Jephthah's daughter through hills and hollows (Rs), it is again the image of</page><page sequence="26">196 ALAN MINTZ Alter the Soldier which recalls Nahman to the present. Like the biblical maid, he realizes, he too would be sacrificed by his father, but unlike her, he would be given nothing in exchange except an opportunity to die a slow death in the beit midrash. The response to the reality of history, which constitutes the final moment of the reverie, is characterized by a double movement of acknowledgement and suppression: the threatening revisions of Nahman's notions about the nature of Jewish existence which are necessitated by the confrontation with the reality of that existence drive him to increasingly more desperate at- tempts to shore up his faith. So, though he knows at the end of his vision of the opening and closing of redemption that he has been ushered into a "dreadful contest between good and evil" (RI), he rebounds by vowing to dedicate his life to bringing the Messiah, and when his efforts become mired in personal weakness (R2), he pursues with greater asceticism the instrumen- tal attainment of the holy spirit (ruab ha-qodesh). Nahman's discovery of the bitter joke at the center of Jewish history (R3), however, is so dangerous a realization that his only response can be shame and remorse: "He would have liked to tear out his heart together with such thoughts and cast it to the swine... -but where could he take refuge from the furies of his own mind?" The monumental speech of Nahman's father sufficiently bolsters his son's conscience to make the scenes in the beit midrash examples of extreme dichotomy: although Nahman's imagination produces one vision after the other of disintegration and entombment, after each he forces his mind back to the text before him with such concentration that he produces new in- terpretations which challenge the master commentators of the Middle Ages. For a moment, lost in the burning intensity of study, he is even ready once again to be a hero on behalf of the Lord and His Torah. The tension can ob- viously not hold and it snaps at the point where doubt has become too radical and denial too extreme. Disciplined in rational thought by his readings in the philosophers, Nahman finally realizes that the teachings of Gersonides have only been "an authority on whom to pin his own heretical thoughts" and that now he must face the fact that he has become utterly and ineradicably a heretic. VI The next day as he prepares for the fast of the Ninth of Ab and later as he listens to the chanting of Lamentations, the grim irony of his apostasy is</page><page sequence="27">FEIERBERG AND REVERIES OF REDEMPTION 197 revealed to him. From the first stirrings of fantasy as a child to his macabre visions of entombment as an adolescent, Nahmari had longed for a world beyond the doorstep of the house of study, whether this -was the "other world" with its "other language" ('olam 'aber, safah 'abheret) he found in the woods beyond the town, or the playful ray of light on the wall of the house of study which bid him discover "what a big, wide, bright wonderful world" is to be found just beyond its confines-this longing for another world had been the distant pole of desire in all of Nahman's reveries throughout. But when the moment of apostasy finally arrives, Nahman realizes he "has become another" (nehpakh le-'aber), and later when he sits lost in his thoughts after extinguishing the candle on Yom Kippur, he realizes that "now, at this very moment he had begun another life (hbayyim 'aberim)." Though bound by the same word, the Other ('aber) which Nahman has become is far different from the liberation and novelty (bayyim 'abzerim) he had sought. Now as an apostate-like the Tannaite sage Elisha ben Abuya, called the Alien One ('Aber)-he listens to the chanting of the Book of Lamentations, mourning more for his lost faith than for the destruction of Jerusalem. As he listens (pp. 177-78, 101-2), he meditates on the fact that even the man described in Lamentations who witnessed the terrible destruc- tion has at least God's promise of ultimate salvation with Which to console himself, while Nahman, who has finally achieved his breakthrough into otherness, has nothing to look forward to but a dark alienage from which there is no appeal.24 As the remaining faithful chant dirges deep into the night, Nahman ex- periences a new reverie (pp. 185-86, 106-7) in which he sees "the wretched masses who were now sitting on the ground in thousands of synagogues all over the earth-a great, wandering, ill-starred people, standing forever by some ruin, weeping, weeping... ." The quality of Nahman's ruminations 24. It is not unlikely that as the prototype for this passage Feierberg had in mind the section of the Mishneh Torah in which Maimonides describes the enlightenment of the prophet and his subsequent separation from ordinary men: When one, .. . sanctifying himself, withdrawing himself from the ways of ordinary men who walk in the obscurities of the times, ... keeping his mind on higher things ... so as to comprehend the pure and holy forms, ... on such a man the Holy Spirit will prompt- ly descend. .. He will be changed into another man (ve-yehafekh le-'adam 'aber) and will realize that he is not the same as he had been, and has been exalted over other wise men, even as it is said of Saul "And thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man" (1 Samuel 10:6).

Hyamson)</page><page sequence="28">198 ALAN MINTZ become less visionary and more declarative as he generalized from his own "monkish isolation from life" to the enchainment of the People as a whole "to the wreckage of their world." His father had striven to bring the redemption with the only "arms" available to him: "the power of mystical awakening"; Nahman declares that he is now ready to accept the responsibility of being a soldier, but only if his "arms" will involve releasing the People for a new life under new heavens. There are a number of other meditation sequences in the remainder of Whither?, especially at the point when Nahman decides to return from the quiescence of the house of his wife's parents to the bosom of his people. What characterizes all of these sections is an unmolding of the imaginative intensity we have come to expect from such passages. The visionary moment at the center of the reverie has been collapsed by a historical illusionlessness which can authorize neither images of romantic martyrdom nor fantasies of supernatural redemption. In place of vision Feierberg introduces affirma- tion, affirmation of the vaguely defined rebirth of the People. This ex- change, noted among others by Gershon Shaked,25 determines the ruling irony of the penultimate sections of Whither?: the great ideological-spiritual leap into the future proclaimed with cries of "Forward! Forward!" is presented in language which, in its discursive statement or enthusiastic ex- hortation, takes us very much in the opposite direction, back to a language barren of the extraordinary movement which embodied the reveries of destruction and imprisonment. The irony simply underscores the fact that the new reality being described had no virtual existence at the time Feierberg was writing; since it too was only a collection of slogans and assertions, its aesthetic representation could hardly attain to much more. What remains genuine in the last sections, however, is the sense of per- sonal loss, the horizonless anguish at the theft of a faith in exchange for which there is nothing worth having, especially the cheap positivism of the Haskalah. In once again locating authenticity within the situation of the in- dividual, the writing in the last third of Whither? vitiates the fusion of sub- jective and collective consciousness which had been the achievement of the reverie-form and returns to the isolation-though not the temperament-of the individual mind in Feierberg's earliest stories. After the great and incomprehensible outburst of his final speech, 25. Gershon Shaked, in a well-argued and useful article on Whither?, has dealt with the es- sayistic quality of the last sections of the novella.

In Nahman's silence lies Feierberg's integrity: the admission that in the absence of the originating imagination silence is preferable to rhetoric. Aphasia is the unnegotiable outcome (and inevitable meaning) of apostasy. The awesome realization Feierberg came to grips with at the end of his novella-and his life-was the paradox that the Jewish imagination lives only through negation. In its struggle to break free of the past, the imagination draws its authenticity of sentiment-and the very materials of its vision-from that which it is oppos- ing. Whether conceived of as a contest with the angel or as a necrophiliac embrace, the exchange of blessings and powers which streams between the writer and his opposing past ceases to flow when the beast is finally dead. It would be left to Hebrew writers who, unlike Feierberg, were allowed even for a little to defer their own deaths, to struggle in the void to create an autonomous aesthetic freedom.</page></plain_text>
