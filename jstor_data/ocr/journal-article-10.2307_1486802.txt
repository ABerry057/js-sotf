New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1990. xxi, 223 pp. Gary Rendsburg writes in the preface that this book was originally his Ph.D. dissertation, done under the supervision of Cyrus H. Gordon (1980) at New York University. (I quite agree when Rendsburg states that his men- tor is "an unsurpassed master of the Hebrew language and a teacher of boundless energy" [p. ix].) During the following decade, he obviously did much more work on its revision for publication, chiefly evident in the book's very rich documentation. Thus there are many references to publica- tions from the 1980s. Rendsburg's thesis is quite clear from the outset, viz., ancient Hebrew</page><page sequence="2">106 BOOK REVIEWS had diglossia. His diachronic perspective is clear as well, as he follows Chaim Rabin in viewing Qumran Hebrew as a direct descendant of Late Biblical Hebrew, and in maintaining that there is evidence to posit a post- biblical diglossia, i.e., people spoke Mishnaic Hebrew but wrote in Qum- ran-Ben Sira Hebrew. Much of chapter 1 (pp. 1-33) is devoted to a discussion of the accomp- lishments of other Semitists, some of whom also theorized that ancient Hebrew was diglossic along the lines of Classical Arabic and its tribal, dia- lectal counterparts (Edward Ullendorff wrote exactly this in 1971). In fact, Rendsburg quotes Ullendorff saying (as far back as 1962) that "some ser- ious work ought to be undertaken, in the light of modern linguistic notions, on the question of dialects and colloquialisms in the Old Testament," to which Rendsburg has added: "The present volume hopes to answer to Ullendorff's recommendation" (p. 17). Many parts of the book are illuminating appraisals of past research on Semitic languages. Thus chapter 1 rightly is critical of the scholarly efforts of E. Z. Melamed, who maintained that the ancient Israelites actually spoke poetically in Biblical Hebrew (totally far-fetched); M. B. Schneider, who concluded that there was no Hebrew diglossia in ancient times; and John MacDonald, who incorrectly assumed that direct quotations in Biblical Hebrew actually reflected speech accurately. Yet, somewhat surprisingly, Rendsburg does not offer the reader any criticism of the ideas of Salih J. Altoma's The Problem of Diglossia in Arabic: A Comparative Study of Classi- cal and Iraqi Arabic (Cambridge, Mass., 1969), which the present reviewer evaluated in not so glowing terms.' Rendsburg has, unfortunately in my view, relied too extensively on Altoma's book for his analogy with Arabic diglossia, a greatly misunderstood subject. For example, when discussing diglossic vocabulary, Rendsburg quotes Altoma about the opposition of Classical Arabic ra?d 'to see' vs. colloquial Arabic sfdf'to see' (p. 27). This is not a totally accurate picture, neither of ancient Arabic diglossia nor for its modern counterpart, because of the existence of Arabic dialects in which this lexical dichotomy does not occur.2 Some Arabic dialects (so-called) 1.

Thus Altoma's conclusions that 12 percent of the Arabic classical-colloquial vocabulary is noncognate (cited by Rendsburg, p. 27) must be questioned. Further, Rendsburg's state- ment that "although it would be hard to quantify the morphological differ- ences between the two varieties, my sense is that it would be greater than 12%" (p. 27) must be viewed cautiously, too, since this is an impressionistic statement (at best); it is not based on any statistical research and, in my opinion, is quite misleading. What kind of Arabic is the author talking about? This is an important question, because Arabic diglossia is different from ancient Hebrew diglos- sia. In actuality, the facts of Arabic dialectology (with which scholars must reckon) provide strong support for the argument that Uzbekistani Arabic, Andalusian Arabic, Cypriot Arabic, Juba Arabic (the Arabic pidgin-creole of the southern Sudan), and Classical Arabic-Modern Standard Arabic are five separate, distinct languages (all being, erroneously but traditionally, called Arabic), just as Maltese (cf. Rendsburg's Maltese Arabic, p. 129) is today a separate, distinct, Semitic language in its own right, although histor- ically, as its verbal morphology still proves, it is unquestionably a dialect of Arabic.3 Moreover, there is no diglossia of which to speak in Maltese, Cypriot Arabic, Juda Arabic, and so on. What I am suggesting is the follow- ing: the analogy of ancient Hebrew diglossia and Arabic diglossia (the latter is actually better viewed as a continuum, i.e., what has been sometimes labeled polyglossia or multiglossia) falls short of being 100 percent equiva- lent or valid for both cases, and can only be extended so far due to the afore- mentioned points; thus we must reflect upon Rendsburg's assumption of Arabic as the paradigm or parallel yardstick utilized: "Notwithstanding these geographic variations, if we use Arabic as our paradigm, we can assume an opposition between the spoken dialect(s) in ancient Israel and the classical language" (p. 21). Swiss vs. Standard German might be a better diglossia paradigm than Arabic simply because ancient Israel and Switzer- land are both small in comparison to the vast territory of the Arab world. The bulk of the book solidly explains and documents gender neutraliza- tion,4 incongruence (gender and number discord), the merger of verba tertiae 3. I make this case in a survey article on Arabic dialectology co-authored with Judith Rosenhouse for Robert Hetzron, ed., The Semitic Languages (London, forthcoming). 4.

Chapter 13 summarizes the above features and concludes that there are "twelve grammatical points" which are "characteristic of ancient spoken Hebrew but not of ancient written Hebrew" (p. 151). Rendsburg has made his case well; however, one must keep in mind that many of these features are widespread cross-linguistically, representing the evolution of a synthetic linguistic type to more of an analytic type of struc- ture-an aspect of the general Semitic drift of which, to be sure, Rendsburg is well aware, for he states: "Most Semitists have explained the above ... differences as the result of historical process of linguistic change. And I am not saying that this approach should be abandoned" (p. 182). I recommend the book as a careful, thoroughly researched, polished con- tribution to Semitic historical linguistics. It shows, once again, that linguists can often confidently reconstruct linguistic (pre-)history using the available evidence which has come down to us. Alan S.
