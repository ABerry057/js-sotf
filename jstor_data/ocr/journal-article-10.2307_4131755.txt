Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2001. xix, 275 pp. The first thing a reader should know about this book is that it was written from Jerusalem. No Jewish city in history, certainly no diaspora city, can hope to compete with Jerusalem. Looking down from Jerusalem, New York looks decidedly grim. As Lederhendler notes with admirable brevity, the "events of May-June 1967 threw into relief the apparent gulf between Israelis (who could fend for themselves) and Jews (who could not)" (190). Diaspora condemns Jews to mere ethnic existence, to life as one group among others. In the 1960s New York Jews recognized "that Diaspora life had become existentially problematic" (190). They faced "cultural despair," de- cline of community, and a loss of nerve that challenged their earlier, "utopian" op- timism about urban life, its freedom, and its Jewish possibilities (87). The second thing a reader should know is that this reviewer's book, At Home in America: Second Generation New York Jews (1981) is explicitly challenged. Lederhendler invites an "ongoing collegial exchange" in his preface (xvi). This re- view is offered in that spirit. I have been waiting for at least a decade for such a book to appear that both builds on my work on ethnicity in the interwar decades and seeks to extend the story and revise it. Lederhendler, however, writes not as a social his- torian but as a cultural historian. I confess at the onset that I find Lederhendler's cultural tack elusive and frustrating, leaving me wondering why certain individuals get a lot of attention (Nathan Glazer, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, and Saul Bellow) and others (fill in your own list of important novelists, essayists, philosophers, rab- bis, musicians, artists, critics) don't. I should state my conclusions at the outset: Lederhendler does not convince me of "the Jews' inability to maintain and transmit the urban ethnic lifestyle that their parents had invented" (202). Despite the title, the book focuses on the 1960s, specifically the half-decade from 1964 to 1969 when New York succumbed to riots, bitter conflict between African Americans and Jews over public education, and a breakdown in city services. Jewish population in the city plummeted during the 1960s. This late and short-lived departure for the suburbs reduced the city's Jewish population from approximately 2.1 million to 1.2 million. What is striking about Jewish participation in "white flight" is how rapid it was and how brief, unlike the movement of other whites, who started leaving in 1950 and continued to leave after 1970. Thus Jews remain a significant percentage of the city's white population, and a majority of the metropolitan area's Jewish population continues to live in New York. Suburbanization provides the con- text for Lederhendler to explore the weaknesses of Jewish culture, the fragmentation of Jewish politics, the vapidity of religious activity, and the failure of Jewish labor unions to integrate a new working class into the promise of urban life. Lederhendler's indictment is powerful. He characterizes Jewish culture in the 1960s as one of "retrieval," burdened by nostalgia for a lost part in Eastern Europe and the Lower East Side. Judaism, too, flounders in the 60s, despite an impressive array of religious thinkers living and writing in New York. Lederhendler is not in- terested in institutional development, although he mentions briefly the enormous numbers of national and international organizations headquartered in the city. Nor is he concerned with congregational rabbis, despite their intellectual prominence 394</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews (e.g., Milton Steinberg) and leadership (e.g., Emmanuel Rackman). Theological pessimism accompanied political pessimism and cultural pessimism. All moved resolutely toward an inward, postintegrationist, Judaism. Lederhendler argues that Jews sought "civility" in politics. He prefers this term to liberalism as it also de- fends the legitimacy and authority of law, a position shared by Jewish neoconser- vatives as well as liberals. The pursuit of civility fragmented Jewish politics and that ultimately gave Jews more power. Indeed, Jews emerge from the 1960s more firm- ly entrenched in positions of authority than in previous decades. Ultimately, Leder- hendler agrees with Nathan Glazer's extraordinarily ahistorical statement: "Even if all the Jews had gone to Argentina or Canada, New York would still be New York, and Buenos Aires and Montreal would still only be pretty much what they are" (50). In short, Jews didn't shape New York, though the city did influence their ethnic life because they came as immigrants with such weak ethnicity. So what's wrong with this picture? Well, if one assumes that diaspora Jew- ish life is not hopelessly ineffectual, then one must ask how the impressive cultur- al achievements of New York Jews in the postwar decades emerged. As a social historian, I look to lived realities: the communities of artists and writers, the con- gregations and institutions that sustained religious thinkers and intellectuals, the audiences that attended concerts and performances and purchased books and mag- azines. New York Jews nourished all those writers and sociologists who attacked them for their bourgeois pretensions, their lack of religious zeal, and their hope- less love affair not with "civility" but with America. New York Jews also contin- ued to produce labor leaders on the left who organized African American and Puerto Rican workers (e.g., local 1199) and who struggled against national an- tiurban policies that encouraged suburbanization through massive highway sub- ventions and the GI bill. Changes and conflicts occurred in the city. Jews moved out of old occupa- tions into new ones; they moved out of old neighborhoods into new ones; they tore the city down and built it up. But neither change nor conflict spell decline (though there are strong currents in American and Jewish culture that bemoan both). Eth- nicity is interactive. Jews come to understand themselves in relation to other Jews and to non-Jews among whom they live. In the postwar decades, New York Jews had to reconfigure their identity as Americans in relation to Israel and as Jews in relation to African Americans and Puerto Ricans. But shared values, attitudes, ways of living and, yes, moral community endured among New York Jews. Were Avrom Reisin to return to the city today, he could easily pen his poem that praised not only the multitude of "countries" and "tongues" but also the experience of be- ing "nowhere a stranger" and "everywhere, a free man." The languages may be dif- ferent (Israeli Hebrew or Yiddish) but the fundamental New York Jewish diasporic experience endures.
