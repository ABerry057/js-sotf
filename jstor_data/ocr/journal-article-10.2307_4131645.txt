<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lisa Lampert. Gender and Jewish Difference: From Paul to Shakespeare. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. 277 pp. In Gender and Jewish Difference, Lisa Lampert proposes that we consider a "hermeneutical woman" alongside the well-documented "hermeneutical Jew" that underpins literary constructions of Christian theology in patristic, medieval, and Renaissance texts (10). The "hermeneutical Jew," a term coined by Jeremy Cohen, is the originary Christian-the Jew who brought the Christian to "the book" and all its exegetical possibilities but who is incapable of seeing the spirit beyond the letter of the law.1 The hermeneutical woman is, according to Lampert, the hermeneutical Jew's mate, so to speak; she is another major locus of symbolic projections of the Christian self onto the "other." Both the hermeneu- tical Jew and the hermeneutical woman are, as Lampert puts it, "hermeneutically handicapped" (43); they read-the Jew because of his literal-mindedness, the woman because of her feeble-mindedness-with spiritual impediments. They are also, within medieval Christian fiction and drama, profoundly "embodied," threatening the very foundations of Christian faith-conversion, incarnation, and transubstantiation. According to Lampert, these three tenets of faith, which exist on the border of the body and the spirit, represent ambiguous moments in Christian theology, and they are best captured by "the woman" and "the Jew," who serve as figures of the spirit subsumed by the body, of transcendence gone awry. 1.

In her analysis of Chaucer, for example, she documents a gradual metonymic evol- ution of the figure of "woman" from being symbolically "Jewish" insofar as she is incapable of seeing the spirit behind the letter ("The Prioress's Tale") to becom- ing a Christian "male" in her ability to interpret texts liberally and spiritually ("Second Nun's Tale"). In her analysis of the Croxton play and N-Town Nativity, Lampert documents the motif of the "stricken hand," in which Jews who attempt to desecrate the host or women who attempt to physically ascertain Mary's virgi- nity are severely disabled through dismemberment. According to Lampert, the audience's reaction to the moments of dismemberment-laughter in the face of horror, relief in the face of penitence-figures as a sign of uncomfortable identi- fication with the supposed aggressor; Christian ambivalence and doubt is inscribed onto the bodies of the actors and enacted by them in the drama. Finally, in her presentation of Shakespeare's Jessica, Lampert points to the ultimately inassimilable nature of the Jew, even when embodied as a woman. Though the male Jew will forever be marked as difference incarnate because of his circumcised genitalia, the woman, in a cursory reading of Shakespeare, has other recourse. But Jessica, in her very "conversion" and "assimilation," remains, unlike Shylock, who is absented from the final act of the play, a disruptive and alien presence. As the sum total of the hermeneutical Jew and the hermeneutical woman, she is doubly rendered other. Though ostensibly empowered through her conversion, Jessica embodies the impossibility of assimilation and integration of "actual" Jews and "actual" women into the Christian theological imagination. Although Lampert is a medievalist, one of her central goals in this study (evidenced by her inclusion of Shakespeare) is to bridge the disciplinary "Medieval/Renaissance divide" (3). Indeed, Lampert argues that, in modem dis- courses, the medieval period has been "curtained off' from serious consideration of Jewish difference and of gender, among other highly theoretical rubrics. She explicitly "invites non-specialists into the world of medieval texts" to illustrate the "dangers of closing the door on them" (7). To this end, Lampert wants to "encourage dialogue between medievalists, early modernists and modernists by using the issues of gender and Jewish which defy periodization boundaries." It was this invitation that I, a scholar of modem Jewish literature and gender, used as my entree into evaluating the book. I was especially aware of Lampert's allusion to some of the biblical and rabbinic discourses with which the notion of Christian supersession is in dialogue. In her discussion of Mary's embodiment as a physical vessel of Jesus' birth, Lampert mentions, for example, the medieval Jewish philosophical polemics against the doctrines of incarnation and transubstantiation, such as those incorpor- ated into Toldot Yeshu (50). Also, in her analysis of Merchant, she alludes to the scene that takes place between Launcelot Gobbo and his father as an intertextual reference to the relationship between Esau and Jacob. The delight with which I read these familiar texts through Lampert's depiction of patristic, medieval, 192</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews and Renaissance texts was only marred by slight (or not so slight?) inaccuracies. ("With the help of Rachel," Lampert says, "Jacob disguises himself with animal skins..." [147]). Nevertheless, Lampert creates an accessible and finely crafted narrative of supersession through analogy and projection. The struggle within the Christian community throughout the broad historical period that Lampert treats to delineate its own boundaries, the struggle to "make" oneself Christian (because in Jerome's words, "Christians are made, not born") rests in the encoun- ter between the self as Christian and the other embodied as Jew and woman.
