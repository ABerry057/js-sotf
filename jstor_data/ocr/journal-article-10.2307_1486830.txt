Mohr, 1992. xvii, 457 pp. Jewish angelology, according to Michael Mach, emerges out of the dialectic between monotheism and ancient Near Eastern polytheism and reaches full flower under the influence of a similar dialectic in the Hellenistic period, although the nature of the relevant polytheism has changed. Mach argues that the biblical conception of the mal'akh, the messenger of the Lord, was originally quite distinct from the other primary locus of biblical angelology, the divine council. The distinct origins are reflected in the names given the members of the divine council, such as 'elohim, bniei 'elohin, seva' ha-shatnayyinm, and qedoshim, but not mnal'akhim. The divine council has its roots in the council of El, but there are no real parallels to the figure of the mal'akh in the religion of Israel's neighbors; unlike the messenger gods of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 403 the ancient Near East, the mal'akh is not a god. That mnal'akh designates a function rather than a state of being is clear from its use for human emissaries as well. The combination of the two conceptions, which Mach calls "the heart of postbiblical angelology," takes place in some of the later parts of the Bible, including Job, some of the Psalms, Daniel, and Zechariah. Mach considers any attempt to explain the causes of the combination to be "purely hypothetical." But surely the prophets' claim to participation in the divine council, which appears as early as the Temple vision of Isaiah of Jerusalem and after that in a range of sources, deserves more consideration than Mach gives it. The importance of this claim for Israelite prophecy seems to me to raise questions if not about the distinct origins, then at least about an ongoing separate existence in biblical literature, for the mal'akh and the divine council. In the second chapter Mach discusses the Septuagint's translations of terms for angels as evidence for the development of Jewish angelology. The collapsing of the distinction between the members of the divine council and the mal'akh continues; like angelic messengers, the members of the council are usually called aggelos. On the other hand, the Septuagint attempts to distinguish between divine and human messengers, often, though not always, finding a translation other than aggelos for the human messengers. The Septuagint also uses translation to eliminate some instances of the Bible's failure to distinguish between God and His messengers, and the resulting theological problems. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the theological concerns about angels reflected in the peculiarities of the translations of two books of particular interest for angelology, Daniel and Job. In the lengthy third chapter Mach discusses the material central to his concerns, the extrabiblical literature of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Mach sees the experience of exile as leading to the transformation of the setting of the divine council from heavenly court to heavenly temple. The multiplication of angels should not be seen as a sign of the distance of the transcendent God, and the belief in the possibility of human fellowship with the angels is at the heart of the new developments. Most of the literature Mach discusses is designated as Jewish in the standard introductions, although often on less than entirely solid grounds, but Mach also includes, quite properly, some early Christian literature in the discussion, such as the New Testament and the Apocalypse of Elijah. In this light the almost complete absence of</page><page sequence="3">404 BOOK REVIEWS attention to the Ascension of Isaiah, an early Christian apocalypse with a very interesting angelology, is surprising. Perhaps Mach's most important contribution is his nuanced discussion of the pagan and even polytheistic aspects of the representation of angels in Jewish literature. His treatment of Asenath's heavenly visitor in Joseph and Asenath, which he calls the "high point" of the integration of Jewish and pagan elements, is itself a high point of such investigation in both method and content. The appropriate question, Mach suggests at the beginning of his discussion of Joseph and Asenath, is how an ancient Jewish reader of the text, for whom the Hellenistic world was home, would have understood the work. Mach sees Asenath's heavenly visitor as one of many Jewish attempts to domesticate the Greek sun god Helios by turning him into an angelic figure. Mach even brings a third culture into the discussion, suggesting that the ancient Egyptian association of the pharaoh with the sun god plays a part in this narrative so deeply shaped by its Egyptian setting. But he also insists that most of the motifs associated with the visitor could also be seen as drawn from the Bible or later Jewish sources. Even the lofty status of the visitor, which Mach relates to the figure of Helios and which might seem to threaten monotheistic belief, is simply a further development of a possibility inherent in biblical angelology. Thus, while Mach never answers the question explicitly, he implies that an ancient Jewish reader would not have viewed the world he lived in as easily separable into discrete Jewish, Greek, and Egyptian components, and thus might have seen elements that appear blatantly pagan to us as part of Judaism. The discussion of Joseph and Asenath is Mach at his best. The extended treatment of a single text permits attention to literary context and, as far as possible given the limited state of our knowledge, to the historical context as well. The rest of the chapter, divided into units that treat a particular motif in a variety of extrabiblical texts, understandably gives less consideration to the larger concerns of the individual works in which the motifs appear or to their historical background. In these units Mach sometimes appears to be offering, against his stated intentions, a collection of traditions rather than a history of the development of the traditions. I wish that Mach had provided a clearer map of his view of the lines of textual influence in the development of angelology, but his motif-by-motif discussion leaves the relevant comments scattered. The Book of Tobit,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 405 for example, plays an important role in Mach's discussion as a sort of bridge between the Bible and postbiblical works, but Mach never offers an extended assessment of its place in the development of angelology. George Nickelsburg's recent discussion of Tobit's points of contact with the Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 1-36) makes Mach's view particularly intriguing; the somewhat younger Book of the Watchers is surely a crucial influence on the development of angelology as on so many aspects of ancient Judaism. The last chapter of Mach's work is a fascinating demonstration that not all ancient Jews shared the dominant enthusiasm for angels. Some were quite selective in their embrace of aspects of angelology. The chapter includes some provocative discussion of New Testament texts, but the bulk of it is devoted to a careful examination of Josephus' complicated attitude toward angels. Theologically, Josephus' feelings are mixed: angels pose some difficulties, but they also solve certain problems. But on the political level angels are a genuine danger because of the hopes anti-Roman forces placed in their intervention. Whether Joseph clarifies the ambivalence of the rabbis' angelology better than rabbinic literature itself, as Mach claims, requires demonstration in a future work, to which I look forward.
