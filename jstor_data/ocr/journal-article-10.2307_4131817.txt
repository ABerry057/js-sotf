<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ithamar Gruenwald. Rituals and Ritual Theory in Ancient Israel. The Brill Refer- ence Library of Judaism. Leiden: Brill, 2003. xii, 278 pp. Ithamar Gruenwald's recent book brings together various essays the author has published over the last few years, each seeking to rethink aspects of ritual the- ory, especially as applied to the rituals of ancient Israel.' After introducing his themes and approach in the first chapter, Gruenwald addresses (in Chapter 2) what he calls the "economic ethos" of ancient Israel, speculating that "in the history of ancient Israel, the transition from ethos to religion is connected to the passage from nomadic lifestyle to an urban one" (p. 67). The third chapter reexamines the rela- tionship between myth and ritual. The last three chapters are devoted to ritual the- ory as it pertains, respectively, to rabbinic halakhah (Chapter 4), biblical sacrifice (Chapter 5), and the "Lord's Supper," as related primarily in the writings of Paul. Throughout the book, Gruenwald emerges as an emphatic spokesperson for the non-symbolic nature of rituals in general, and of biblical sacrifice in particular. While this book is wide-ranging in scope, a significant portion of chapters 2 and 6 are devoted to the stated theme of chapter 5: biblical sacrifice. Because Gruen- wald himself believes that "sacrifices constitute the core of religion" (p. 189), per- haps the best way to review his complicated book briefly is to examine his ap- proach to this particular ritual structure. With regard to ritual in general and sacrifice in particular, Gruenwald main- tains that rituals create, or establish, their own meaning in the very act of doing and in the logic that constitutes the processual manner in which they are done 1.

Let me repeat that, to say that there is meaning in rituals is not tanta- mount-as many scholars think-to saying they are symbolic expressions of ideas. The meaning is contained in the performed essence of the rituals (pp. 198-199). Put more briefly, Gruenwald elsewhere states that rituals "should be understood by what they aim to accomplish, rather than by what they stand for" (p. 69). In its em- phasis on what rituals achieve, Gruenwald's approach can be called functionalist. But unlike Mary Douglas, Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, and many others oper- ating in the functionalist tradition (broadly conceived), Gruenwald resists recog- nizing that symbols play a key role in how rituals shape or reflect societies. There are some important contributions in this work. Gruenwald is correct to be disappointed with the current level of involvement in ritual studies by Jew- ish Studies scholars (though to be fair to the field, it is also important to note that Gruenwald's bibliography is hardly complete in this regard). The author is also cor- rect to recognize that much work on ritual in general (and sacrifice in particular) is "theology in disguise" (p. 236; cf. pp. 3, 5, 160-161, etc.). Gruenwald correct- ly criticizes the late-nineteenth-century evolutionist theories (189-190). More- over, he is correct to step away from Frits Staal's extreme reductionist position on the non-symbolic nature of rituals (p. 198). Yet Gruenwald's overall thesis does not convince. The shortcomings of his analyses illustrate well the difficulties involved in trying to escape from either symbolism or theology when discussing rituals. Gruenwald seems to think that his turn away from symbolism supports his effort to liberate ritual studies from theology (pp. x, 5-6). But the assertion that ritual is non-symbolic is not theologically neutral. To the contrary, this move is sus- piciously reminiscent of rationalist strains in Jewish philosophy (such as Mai- monides and Mendelssohn) that continue to have influence particularly in modern Orthodox circles (cf., p. xi). These approaches, in turn, have their precedents in some rabbinic texts, including the famous tradition attributed to Yohanan ben Zak- kai to the effect that the red heifer ritual has no known symbolic or even rational basis.2 The Jewish theologians who have maintained the non-symbolic approach- es to ritual-from Yohanan ben Zakkai (or whoever composed the tradition at- tributed to him) through Mendelssohn and beyond-have by no means articulat- ed non-theological approaches to ritual. Gruenwald's approach, therefore, does not truly escape theology, but rather takes a side in long-standing theological debates concerning the role of ritual in religious systems. In the study of rituals, symbolism may well prove just as inescapable as the- ology. Even while he steadfastly maintains that rituals are in essence non-symbol- ic, Gruenwald states repeatedly that rituals have meaning. For Gruenwald, rituals are "expressions" (p. 159): they "communicate" (p. 162), "speak" (p. 176), and "represent" (p. 205). Curiously, though Gruenwald spurns theology, he adopts Rene Girard's neo-gnostic approach to the meaning of sacrifice, so that offerings "mimetically assume the victim status of a person or group" (pp. 217, 259-260). But the ritual process is still not a symbolic one: sacrifice is a "real event" (p. 217). 2. Pesikta de Rav Kahana, Parah 7 (ed. Mandelbaum, 1:74). 164</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Clearly, Gruenwald's understanding of symbolism is rather narrow: most scholars who view rituals as representing things would not be so reluctant to speak of sym- bols. His evaluation of symbolism is also rather negative: rituals achieve things while "mere symbolism" is powerless (pp. 259-260). The trick to understanding what Gruenwald is getting at is to keep in mind that the author has a tendency to redefine the terms of debate. Rituals become "be- haviourally autonomous ... expressions of the mind" (p. 2). Myths constitute "the reality configured to establish a functional relation to ritual" (p. 68). Gruenwald similarly redefines "existence" (p. 24), "ethos" (p. 41), "cosmos" (p. 69), and even "reality" (pp. 69, 195), among a number of other terms. Curiously, the term "sym- bolism," is left undefined, at least as far as I can tell (unfortunately, the book lacks a general index). Then, toward the end of the book the reader discovers the author's positive evaluation of the anthropologist Stanley J. Tambiah's definition of ritual as a "culturally coded system of symbolic communication" (pp. 242-243). One can surely ask at this point whether Gruenwald has really demonstrated that ritual is not symbolic or whether he has just redefined all the terms in such a fashion that "symbolism" no longer means for him what it does for Tambiah or most other scholars of ritual. Scholars surely should reserve the right to redefine terms-I could hardly advise otherwise. However, scholarly redefinitions of common terms ought to be restricted to cases where previous definitions have led to serious misunderstand- ings. Gruenwald has not made this case. His approach is to work in the other di- rection: he redefines the terms, and then complains that other scholars have failed to put things in precisely the way he would prefer. There are some serious issues discussed here, and that is what to admire in a broadly conceived, theoretically in- formed, bold rethinking of ritual in ancient Judaism. But when a work redefines nearly all the terms of the debate, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to evaluate or appreciate its particular contribution.
