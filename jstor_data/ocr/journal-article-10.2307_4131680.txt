<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Chazan. Fashioning Jewish Identity in Medieval Western Christendom. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. xiii, 375 pp. Robert Chazan has written a useful and provocative book that surveys a group of important Jewish polemical texts from Spain and southern France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Chazan's discussion includes the work of Joseph Kimhi, Jacob ben Reuben, David Kimhi, Rabbi Meir bar Simon, and Rabbi Moses ben Nahman, all of whom wrote, he believes, in response to heightened Christian intellectual and conversionary pressure. Chazan guides us through the texts and highlights how the authors crafted a defense of Judaism (and a parallel attack on Christianity) based on a Jewish under- standing of scripture, history, and, to some extent, reason. Chazan does not insist that these authors were doing anything radically new. One of the strengths of the book is that virtually half of it is devoted to tracing the themes of Jewish-Christian polemic from late antiquity. This part of the book serves as an excellent introduc- tion to the major themes of Jewish-Christian disputation, such as the correct reading of scriptural verses that seem to refer to a Messiah, the historical punish- ment of the Jewish people in exile, and the permanence of biblical law. But just as these disputes date back to the first years of Jewish-Christian disagreements, Chazan rightly reminds us-referring to the extensive work of Daniel Lasker- that Jews in the Islamic world had already outlined critiques of Christianity. It was out of these two long-standing traditions that the polemical discourse of the French and Spanish Jews evolved. Though the core of the book is largely a running commentary on the central issues presented by the texts, Chazan draws attention to aspects that deserve further study, such as the intriguing Jewish acceptance of the New Testament as a reliable historical source. Perhaps because Chazan is so at home with these texts, the book reads a bit too much like an informal lecture or seminar discussion; he leaves the book's most interesting insight to the end, where he suggests that the driving force behind the responses to Christianity was an overarching appeal to reason. Earlier in the book, he seems to suggest that what really mattered was the nature of exegesis, but in the concluding chapter, he sees the Jewish writers as appealing to the reasonableness of the Jewish reading of scripture, history, and nature of Judaism itself. It is important to pursue this interesting suggestion further, as it risks confusing reason and reasonableness. Much of the Jewish conflict with Christian 453</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews exegetes and commentators stemmed from the Christian rejection of central Jewish principles such as the unity of God, the observance of the law, and God's love of Israel. The rejection of these principles, just as for Christians the Jewish rejection of Jesus and other first principles, makes any Christian argument seem lacking in reason. That may be different from seeing reason as the true pathway to or confirmation of religious truth. A scholastic use of reason and logic is absent from these Jewish texts. The Jewish reading of scripture and history seems reasonable because it comports with fundamental Jewish religious beliefs, not because it adheres to a system of logical thinking. Still, it is striking to see this Jewish appeal to reason-the same ideal that Chazan describes as animating Christian theo- logical rhetoric of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His insight points to the interesting paradox that as Jews and Christians struggled bitterly over religious truth, they did so using the same intellectual tools-or at least appealed to the same intellectual ideal. His book thus becomes part of a growing literature that emphasizes the social and religious commonalities of Jews and Christians in medieval Europe. Although Chazan never directly addresses the title-the role these texts played in fashioning Jewish identity (a futile task perhaps because the wider recep- tion of these texts is virtually impossible to measure)-his presentation of the issues and strategies provides another pathway to assess how Jews perceived their position in Christian Europe. Do the texts reflect a community under siege, desperately trying to sustain its identity, or a self-confident community parrying attacks with a repertoire of forceful responses? Like so many other fundamental historical questions, the answer to this one must be left to each reader. This book may not answer the question, but it reinforces the crucial nature of the question. Chazan's book is thus a useful introduction to several important medieval Jewish texts and to the major themes in Christian-Jewish polemical literature, and most importantly, it will help us meditate further on the mystery of Jewish identity in medieval Europe.
