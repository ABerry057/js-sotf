<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sidney Goldstein and Alice Goldstein. Jews on the Move: Implications for Jewish Identity. SUNY Series in American Jewish Society in the 1990s. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. xxviii, 398 pp. Demographers Alice and Sidney Goldstein have in this book mined the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey to study the cultural implications of Jewish geographic mobility. Sponsored by the Council of Jewish Federations, the 1990 survey of the Jewish people in America collected a massive body of data on the religious, social, economic, and demographic experiences of American Jews, making its statistical findings available to researchers, and as such to the larger public. NJPS was not intended "just" to gather empirical data in the abstract pursuit of knowledge; the planners and scholars involved with the project expected that the material would directly benefit the Jewish community, particularly the leaders of its institutions, both professional and lay, who determine the shape of communal life. The authors of Jews on the Move describe themselves as "committed Jews." They intended this book, and the others that will follow from the NJPS data, to enhance the project of strengthening Jewish life at the end of the twentieth century, "some one hundred years since the massive waves of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe began to change the size and character of Jewry in the United States" (p. xxiii). The Goldsteins chose an appropriate topic with which to launch a mono- graphic series. Jews on the Move, the first book-length publication spawned by NJPS, identifies geographic mobility as a characteristic of Jewish life essential to understanding Jewish identity in the 1990s, as essential as it was one hundred years earlier. The Jews who emerge on the pages of this</page><page sequence="2">344 BOOK REVIEWS book found themselves, as the title implies, "on the move," a highly mobile population. The book focuses on the causes, nature, and most importantly the implications, for Jews as individuals and for Jewish communities as living entities, of those migrations. Migration obviously is not a new force in Jewish life, American or global. The Goldsteins, accomplished demographers with an impressive list of publications and research projects to their credit, both Jewish and non-Jewish, have sought to understand, as much as possible, the Jewish migrations of the end of the century in relationship to those in earlier decades. Because of the random spottiness of earlier statistical material on Jewish migrations in America, they cannot offer perfectly complementary or equivalent portraits of earlier eras in this history. But despite this limitation they do present a convincing historical trajectory against which the reader can understand contemporary Jewish life. Until the 1950s American Jews differed dramatically from the American population as a whole in terms of both their residential and migratory experiences. The family and community patterns of American Jews grew out of their overwhelmingly urban residential choices. Most Jews lived in a few places, and those few places tended to have relatively large numbers of Jews in them. When Jews moved they tended to move en masse, joining up with other Jews in newer sections of the cities in which they had long dwelled. Until the 1920s Jewish internal migration in the United States took place in the context of a growing Jewish population, created by both immigration from abroad and relatively high levels of childbearing. Jews on the Move defines the period immediately following World War II as the moment of change. Jews, young people in particular, chose to move out of the urban neighborhoods of dense Jewish life to new places, either in the burgeoning suburbs or "out of town," where economic opportunity beckoned and where they had access to bigger, better housing. Initially the movement seemed to be gradual, but the 1990 data boldly demonstrated a dramatic shift. In their settlement patterns, as revealed by the NJPS, Jews differed little from everyone else in America, holding class constant. Jews dispersed themselves widely across the American landscape and seemed to have made the choice of where to live utterly independent of Jewish factors. That dramatic shift serves as the analytic center of the Goldsteins' book. Increasingly Jews have opted to move to places where they do not necessarily find a large, or indeed any, Jewish community. They spread out widely for reasons of economic opportunities or because of lifestyle</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 345 choices, to places with little in the way of an established Jewish communal infrastructure. These migrations involve movements to the ever outer fringes of the large metropolitan areas, often to the newest suburbs and to zones that demographers refer to either as exurbia or as edged cities. Likewise the new Jewish migrants have chosen smaller communities, modest-sized cities in the South, the Midwest, and the Far West, places which in the past housed skeletal Jewish communities or in many cases no Jewish community at all. The data indicate as well that by the 1990s, because of this constant movement, Jews lived less often in proximity to family. This, the authors assume, particularly complicates the "traditional" process by which Jewish identity and values are disseminated from one generation to the next. Jews on the Move offers a clearly written narrative, a text that will be easily understood even by scholars and communal leaders who do not handle statistical data with ease. It cogently argues for migration as a key factor in understanding Jewish behavior, personal and communal. Moreover, the book provides a good compendium of data on the Jews who moved: where they came from and where they went, what impelled their migration, what kinds of Jewish lives they constructed in their new homes. The findings in Jews on the Move do not go in a single direction, and the Goldsteins discerned both positive and negative implications in the late-twentieth-century Jewish mobility patterns they studied, with positive obviously meaning that which would sustain Jewish identity and life, and negative meaning factors that foster continued assimilation into the American mainstream. On the one hand, Jews who go to communities with few coreligionists tend to become more involved in the Jewish community than they were in the more densely settled Jewish settings they left. Indeed, as Jews have opted for a wide range of newer, smaller communities, in the West and the South in particular, they have played a transformative role in forming new institutions and breathing life into relatively stagnant ones. Yet the book also offers a negative view of these migrations, and by and large, the authors tend to see this as more salient. Institutions have a harder time providing services to the geographically mobile. The farther Jews move from one other, Alice and Sidney Goldstein conclude, the less they define those services--community centers, schools, kosher butcher shops-as particularly important in lived life. As social scientists with a communal agenda, the authors of Jews on the Move follow the presentation of facts and the analysis of their meaning with prescriptions for the future. Since the movement of Jews beyond the</page><page sequence="4">346 BOOK REVIEWS geographic cores of Jewish settlement has disrupted the established local networks of Jewish associational life, Sidney and Alice Goldstein call upon communal leaders to think in national rather than local terms. "Migration will continue to be a central feature" (p. 330) of Jewish life in America, they predict. It behooves organizations and institutions to start thinking about linking communities and migrants rather than to continue thinking about "community" in terms of local places bounded by geography. Jews on the Move offers a helpful synthesis of a large corpus of statistical data. It will undoubtedly be read by Jewish policy makers who struggle with the condition of American Jews in the postmodern world. While the historical material is, of necessity, rather thin and sketchy, it still has interesting implications for historians, who generally read Jewish migration only in terms of a single move from one place to another, usually Europe to the United States. They rarely look at migration as a ongoing, multistaged process and do not examine the multiple implications of the centripetal patterns of Jewish life. Hasia R.
