While denigrations of the Israelite purity system and priestly traditions are still to be found, there seems to be an increasing willingness to give Leviticus the ben- efit of some doubt, considering it to be something other than a dry, rigid, ritual- istic, and hierarchical code. These two books argue forcefully, convincingly-and quite differently--against many previous misunderstandings of Leviticus. What is more, we can perhaps even begin to speak of an emerging consensus on one important issue that both books deal with: the nature of ritual impurity. More and more scholars seem to be saying what these two are: that ritual impurity is a com- plex ritual structure, not a blunt instrument of social control. But if the evalua- tion of Leviticus in general (and ritual impurity in particular) is positive in both of these books, they share little else. It is difficult to conceive of two scholarly books with as many overlapping concerns, published in the same year and coun- try, which differ so much with regard to scope, structure, and method. They dif- fer too, in the end, with regard to both quality and importance. In the early 1990's, Mary Douglas embarked on a project that involved rethinking many of the major tenets of her earlier classic, Purity and Danger.I She read up on biblical studies, learned some Hebrew, and took on the daunting task of understanding better the books of Leviticus and Numbers. Douglas published a number of articles,2 and devoted a volume to the book of Num- 1.

To those familiar with Purity and Danger but unfamiliar with her recent work, Leviticus as Literature may come as something of a shock: gone is the functionalist concern with boundary maintenance, gone is the symbolic impor- tance of anomalies, and gone, too, is the assumption that the purity system of Le- viticus is-at least functionally-akin to the purity systems of peoples of Africa or India. Douglas now believes that the ritual impurity system of ancient Israel was something rather unique: a purity system that does not serve to subordinate castes or to channel accusations (p. viii). What is even more striking is not the rethinking of ritual impurity, but its displacement. Gone is the overarching concern with ritual purity altogether. Although concerns with purity appear (see Chapters Seven through Nine), other ritual structures important to Leviticus-such as sacrifice- receive equal attention. But despite all this, some familiar aspects remain: Doug- las is still concerned with the comparative enterprise, as evidenced by her discus- sions of Chinese and Greek science and literature (Chapters Two and Three). She still looks for and finds symbolic explanations for ritual structures, as evidenced by her discussions of sacrifice and food laws (Chapters Four, Seven and Eight). She still rejects "itemized" (p. 22) or "piecemeal" solutions, preferring, instead, more structural, holistic explanations.4 And she remains an anthropologist: Leviti- cus as Literature is liberally peppered with practical insights derived from field- work anthropologists and, closer to home, consultations with butchers and bakers (see below). To those who feel that commentaries on Leviticus can seem rather bookish, Leviticus as Literature is a welcome respite. Douglas' concern in the present work is to comment on Leviticus as a whole and to "reintegrate the book with the rest of the Bible" (p. 1). If in her previous works on purity systems, Douglas set out to comment on complete ritual struc- tures, here the structure that most captivates our author is that of the book of Leviti- cus itself. Just as in her recent analysis of Numbers, Douglas believes that the key to understanding Leviticus is knowing how the book is to be read. But if Numbers can be read as if its chapters form a straightforward ring (as she argues in In the Wilderness), Leviticus cannot: it is a ring with a rather substantial twist.5 Yet Doug- las withholds describing the precise nature of this twist until the penultimate chap- Study of the Old Testament 59 (1993): 3-23; "The Glorious Book of Numbers," Jewish Studies Quar- terly 1.3 (1993/4): 193-216; "Holy Joy: Rereading Leviticus: The Anthropologist and the Believer," Conservative Judaism 46.3 (1994): 3-14; "Poetic Structure in Leviticus," in Pomegranates and Gold- en Bells: Studies in Biblical, Jewish and Near Eastern Ritual, Law, and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom, eds.

Thus, Douglas articulates here a position quite different than that which she espoused in her 1993 article, "The Forbidden Animals of Leviticus," where she views Leviticus as a simple ring (p. 11). 90</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay ter of the book (pp. 221-223). Her book, in turn, takes on something of Leviticus' structure-both books using the technique of "delayed completion" (pp. 151, 193). Just as Leviticus is an elaborate riddle, so, too, is Leviticus as Literature. In his recent intellectual biography of Mary Douglas-to which the interested read- er ought to refer for a discussion of Douglas' rich life and remarkably wide-rang- ing work-Richard Fardon has demonstrated how difficult it can be to extract from or even attempt to summarize a complete book by Mary Douglas.6 What follows, therefore, is a rather straightforward reading of a book that, at times, I fear I have misread. In her first chapter, "The Ancient Religion," Douglas sets out some of her basic assumptions. Ancient Israelite religion, as it developed fully, can be distin- guished from what came before by virtue of the fact that it has eliminated the rit- ual roles once played by monarchs, deceased ancestors, demons, and diviners. Ful- ly developed Israelite religion-what Douglas calls the "Levitical resynthesis" (p. 5)-has three "planks": (1) divine justice, (2) the covenant with its promise of fertility, and (3) the symbolic expression of said covenant, circumcision. She then situates Leviticus in the post-exilic period (p. 7), though one suspects that she re- ally wishes to side-step the issue altogether: she grants that Leviticus must have had something of a substantial pre-history, and she later grants the possibility that Leviticus and Deuteronomy were composed contemporaneously (p. 14, 29).7 Douglas' concern is not to solve or even to take a clear side on the question of Leviticus' date. Her real concern is to set the stage for a sympathetic reading of Leviticus, and in order to do so she must reject the "moral evolutionism" which characterizes the way in which William Robertson Smith (and even more recent biblical scholars) date literary strands in the Hebrew Bible. Typically, when schol- ars date biblical strands, Leviticus (or "P") is usually judged to be morally chal- lenged. The hard and fast distinction between the priestly strand (P) and the Holi- ness Code (H) drawn by some scholars serves this purpose all too neatly by assigning to the latter all that seems morally upright in Leviticus. Douglas is right to dismiss such approaches as "P-baiting" (p. 129). Yet there is something of a trou- bling double standard in Douglas' approach, for our author has nonetheless en- dorsed an evolutionism of her own, whereby the religion of Israel is seen as uniquely "modern" among ancient religions, parallel to Christianity (p. 11). To those who are familiar with the ways in which Leviticus (and its main themes of purity and sacrifice) are treated in contemporary New Testament scholarship, Douglas' book is a welcome change. Yet I wonder whether she has pushed too far. It is one thing to view Leviticus with sympathetic eyes. It is quite another to see it as a unique development, something that can, suspiciously, be compared to things that came much later. Having set her understanding of ancient Israelite religion in-and against- an ancient near eastern background, Douglas' next move is to separate Leviticus from Deuteronomy by showing how different their literary styles are. This must be 6. Richard Fardon, Mary Douglas: An Intellectual Biography (London: Routledge, 1999), pp. 75- 6, 80, 83-4. 7. Elsewhere in the work, Douglas plays with the possibility of assigning Deuteronomy to the post-exilic period (pp. 105-6). 91</page><page sequence="4">Jonathan Klawans done, first of all, because Douglas believes that traditional approaches to Leviti- cus have been characterized by the imposition of Deuteronomy onto Leviticus (pp. 13, 25, 64).8 Second, this must be done because the Leviticus-Deuteronomy contrast highlights distinctive aspects of Leviticus that are shared by both P and H (pp. 33-40). Thus, pitting Leviticus against Deuteronomy justifies treating the former holistically. Over the course of Chapters Two and Three, Douglas distin- guishes between two types of thought and writing. Never one to read, think, or write with blinders on, Douglas here builds on the work of classicists (e.g., Mar- cel Detienne), philosophers (e.g., Ernst Cassirer and Suzanne Langer), sinologists (e.g., A. C. Graham), sociologists (e.g., Basil Bernstein), and other anthropolo- gists (especially Claude L6vi-Strauss). Douglas develops a distinction between "analogical," and "mythopoetic" thought (and writing) on the one hand, and "ra- tional" and "discursive" thought (and writing) on the other. In Douglas' understand- ing of these matters, Leviticus is a perfect example of the former, and Deuteron- omy of the latter. Douglas here continues to reject any evolutionistic implications of these distinctions (pp. 16-17, 29, 33). The point is not to put Leviticus and Deuteronomy into some chronological sequence, but to put them in different, though possibly contemporary, social milieux. Yet Douglas remains frustratingly vague about the precise milieu of either.9 What results from all this is the follow- ing: Leviticus is a highly structured symbolic expression of an archaizing priest- ly elite living in some closed world. Deuteronomy, on the other hand, is an ex- tended sermon, a transparent and emotional work, expressed in plain language, with clear political concerns, and overt coercive interests (Chapters Three and Five). What precisely is the nature of Leviticus' mythopoetic thought? The central idea of Douglas' work is that "Leviticus exploits to the full an ancient tradition which makes a parallel between Mount Sinai and the Tabernacle" (p. 59). So, as we find out toward the end of her book, the twist in Leviticus' ring results from the fact that the book's structure maps out the Israelite tabernacle as described in Exodus. Leviticus 1-17 forms the first ring (p. 192), which conforms to the outer court (pp. 221-222). Leviticus 18-24 then maps out the inner court, and Leviti- cus 25-27 conforms to the Holy of Holies (see chart on p. 223). As we find out throughout her book, each set of rules laid out in Leviticus-sacrifice, food laws, purity laws, the Holiness Code-can be understood in light of this overarching analogy. In Chapter Four, we find the very best of what Leviticus as Literature has to offer. If Leviticus tends to fare badly in contemporary scholarly approaches to ancient Israel, sacrifice tends to fare even worse. The literature here is vast, but suffice it to say that the few pages she devotes to countering anti-sacrificial ide- ologies in contemporary scholarship ought to be required reading (pp. 66-67). Sac- 8. This is actually a highly questionable claim, one that is hardly supported by the fact that both the Sifra on Leviticus and the Sifre to Deuteronomy were, possibly, composed by "Akiban" schools (p. 13, n. 2). Indeed, both the Temple Scroll (1lQT) and the Sifre provide numerous examples of pre- cisely the reverse: Deuteronomy being read (or revised) in light of Leviticus. 9. A good number of her discussions of chronology are phrased in the subjunctive mood (e.g., pp. 104-8); cf. her general discussion pp. 6-7. 92</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay rifice is typically vilified in the west by the religious and the secular alike, with the result that few are interested in uncovering the symbolic meaning of sacrificial rit- uals.'0 All such uncovering would require, actually, is taking the methods laid out decades ago in Purity and Danger and applying them to Israelite sacrificial ritu- als. Although this has been done successfully with regard to other religious tradi- tions, I biblical scholars have generally chosen not to entertain the possibility that the Hebrew Bible's sacrificial rules can be analyzed as symbolic systems. In Chap- ter 4 of Leviticus as Literature we have, finally, Douglas' own treatment of sacri- fice, and it is characterized by all that is good in her approach to rituals. She op- erates under the assumption that ritual structures convey meaning: even sacrifice is "philosophy by enactment" (p. 68). She eschews itemized solutions, and search- es for "integrated" (i.e., systemic) ones. She breaks down boundaries, and draws on the full resources of the Hebrew Bible in order to figure out what that philos- ophy being enacted by sacrifice might have been. The central insight here-and it is a good one-is that the same tripartite scheme involved in the analogy between Sinai and the tabernacle (p. 62) can be mapped onto the carcass of an animal offered for sacrifice (p. 79). The beauty of the theory is that everything finds its place: the prohibited fats serve to mark out the boundaries between three zones of the carcass, each of which corresponds to one of the three zones of the tabernacle. Typically, her theory is quite compre- hensive. Her interest in animal parts extends as far as to the lobe over the liver (e.g., Lev. 3:15), to which she assigns a meaning by drawing an analogy between sacri- ficial remains and the prophetic doctrines of the remnant of Israel (pp. 71-72, 81- 86). She eventually works into her theory the prohibitions of leaven and honey (pp. 163-166). One idea sure to raise some eyebrows is her suggestion (pp. 77- 78) that tarn, usually translated as "legs," really means "genitals" (and "nwp is as- signed a sense similarly associated with fertility). Douglas' method is not for the squeamish (p. 82 of this chapter is where her consultations with a butcher come to play)-but how else will Leviticus ever be understood? The commentators will no doubt question many of her specific claims, but taken as a whole, this single chapter is probably as important as any that has been written on Leviticus, perhaps since the third chapter of Purity and Danger Just as that chapter has had a substan- tial and lasting impact on the ways people look at Leviticus 11-15 (would anyone now try to analyze these taboos one by one?), Chapter Four of Leviticus as Liter- ature deserves to have the same impact on the ways people look at Leviticus 1- 10. Perhaps more scholars will now entertain the possibility that ancient Israelite sacrificial rules were as symbolic and expressive as the food laws are commonly believed to be. The rest of the book proceeds along these same lines. Douglas is treading in more familiar waters when she reanalyzes the food laws (Chapters Seven and 10.

But the solutions suggested here will not always be familiar to her readers. Douglas rethinks her own views as much as she rethinks others', and as a result we have yet another novel take on the food laws,12 and even more new food for thought on other purity regulations.13 Doug- las' anthropological instincts also bring us an interesting chapter on oracles, which raises a rather practical question: in the absence of divination (banned by both Leviticus and Deuteronomy), how would one know when one ought to bring a sac- rifice for sins unwillingly-or even unknowingly-committed? What was said above regarding sacrifice could be said regarding each of these chapters: we see throughout the products of a fertile mind. Of course, a number of Douglas' ideas may not withstand the test of time. They may not even withstand her next book. But nonetheless, the book is fascinating and provocative: precisely what we would expect from Douglas. Those who devote the time to grappling with her volume will be better for it. In the end, I have few qualms with the ways in which Douglas sets out to read Leviticus. Though not all will be convinced by her take on the structure of Leviticus, her case is both compelling and important. Despite what one thinks about distinctions within Leviticus-between the priestly stand (P) and the Holi- ness Code (H)-a very cogent case can be made for reading the book of Leviti- cus as a self-contained whole, precisely as we have it.14 What is more, a good case can also be made for putting chronological questions-both relative (i.e., Leviti- cus' relation to Deuteronomy) and absolute (i.e., Leviticus as pre- or post-exilic)- on the back burner. And Douglas herself has made the case here (p. 1) and else- where" that a full understanding Leviticus must draw on the full resources of the Hebrew Bible. I do however have serious reservations about the way Douglas reads Deuter- onomy. In her passionate defense of the third book of the Pentateuch, she has turned the tables completely, resulting in a work that can justly be accused of "D-baiting." If both Leviticus and Numbers have elaborate (and not obvious) structures, is it not possible that Deuteronomy has one?16 If Leviticus can only be 12. Chapters 7 and 8 of Leviticus as Literature differ markedly not only from Chapter 3 of Pu- rity and Danger (the predominant concern is no longer the categories of creation), but even from her more recent treatments of these laws. In " The Forbidden Animals" (pp. 18-23), Douglas draws a con- nection between priestly rules on blemishes (Lev. 21:18-24) and the lex talionis (Lev. 24:19-20), and suggests that the food laws serve, at least in part, to protect those animals whose bodies are character- ized by something superfluous or something lacking. Thus the dietary laws are an enactment of divine justice. (See also "Holy Joy.") In Leviticus as Literature, however, Douglas suggests that the primary concern of the dietary laws is to enact God's blessing ("be fruitful and multiply") by not eating the most fertile of creatures. What these two newer theories share, against Chapter 3 of Purity and Danger, is that the prohibited animals are not abominable at all; what is abominable is to eat these creatures. 13. Again, those who have read the articles cited in n. 2 above should not assume that they know what Douglas will say in these chapters of Leviticus as Literature. 14. See Rolf Rendtorff, "Is it Possible to Read Leviticus as a Separate Book?" in Sawyer, ed., Reading Leviticus, pp. 22-35. 15. "Sacred Contagion," p. 106. 16. Granted, scholars have not yet found one (pp. 50-52), but as Douglas herself grants, until recently, many scholars never discerned much of a structure to Numbers either. 94</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay properly understood by drawing on the full resources of the Bible, can it really be the case that Deuteronomy is fully self-contained?" And even if it is, does it not contain articulate expressions of many of the concerns that Douglas holds dear- covenant, fertility, and justice? Can a text that dutifully relates not only all that, but also the food laws in all their detail really be "theologically superficial" (p. 174)? I fear that one of two things is true. One possibility is that our author has let her- self get carried away. In her zeal to ascribe all the compassion to Leviticus, she's left with little of her own to spare for Deuteronomy. The other possibility is that I have misread the book. Perhaps we're not supposed to read Leviticus as Literature as if it were Deuteronomy, but as if it were Leviticus. Just like Leviticus is sup- posed to be read only by drawing on the full resources of the Bible, is Leviticus as Literature supposed to be read only by drawing on the full resources of Mary Douglas' own work? Is Leviticus as Literature, like Leviticus itself, some form of "restricted code" (p. 38)? Considering the strength of her convictions and the nov- elty of her ideas, I suspect that Douglas has left unstated her criticism of others of us-I would have to include myself here-who have been struggling with some of the same questions. What is more, I suspect that Douglas has left unstated her wish that we read Leviticus as Literature alongside her other work (even Purity and Danger), not against it. But as a reviewer, my task can only be to comment on what is there, not to speculate on what is not. Some two decades ago, G. S. Kirk published an important evaluation of Mary Douglas' methodology as it pertains to sacrificial rituals in general (and to Greek rituals in particular)."8 Though the article is in some respects dated now, one key issue raised by Kirk deserves to be noted here. While endorsing Douglas' struc- tural insights, Kirk calls for some middle ground between the "piecemeal" solu- tions that Douglas rejects and the single-principle theories that she often espouses instead. What Kirk would like to see is: the careful re-statement of functionalism in relation to those accidents, con- fusions, syncretisms, and historical changes that make religion in particular, including its rituals and the practice of animal sacrifice not least of all, such a multifarious and often contradictory affair (p. 54). From Purity and Danger through Leviticus as Literature Mary Douglas has fre- quently championed new and fascinating ideas that she then-at least so it seems to many of us-pushes too far. Can the dietary laws of Leviticus 11 be explained any more on a one-by-one basis? Probably not. Can they all be explained by the single elegant idea that the abominations of Leviticus cohere perfectly with the cat- egories of creation laid out in Genesis 1? Again, probably not. Or, now, can the rules of Leviticus 11 be explained by the single idea that God has, out of kindness, prohibited Israel from eating the most fertile of animals (p. 174)? Again, probably 17. In one rather surprising passage (p. 147), Douglas even resorts to Deuteronomy Chapter 7 in her elucidation of Leviticus' conception of impurity. 18. See G. S. Kirk, "Some Methodological Pitfalls in the Study of Ancient Greek Sacrifice (in Particular)," in Olivier Reverdin, Bernard Grange, and Jean-Pierre Vernant, eds., Le Sacrifice dans L'antiquitd: huit exposds suivis de discussions (Geneva: Fondation Hardt, 1980), pp. 41-80. 95</page><page sequence="8">Jonathan Klawans not. Is Douglas well aware of this? I suspect that to be the case, but to argue it one would, again, have to read Leviticus as Literature in the way that Mary Douglas reads Leviticus. One final matter: In her preface, Douglas repeats a point she has made of- ten in recent times: the more that pollution theory developed, and the more that pollution was seen as the vehicle of accusations and downgradings, the more I was bound to ac- knowledge that it does not apply to the most famous instance of the Western tradition, the Pentateuch (p. viii).'9 Then she goes on to state: "General pollution theory still stands, but its applica- tion to the Bible is limited." Presumably, what she means here is that we are indeed still to read and learn from Purity and Danger, and we are to assume that all oth- er purity systems function in ways more or less akin to what is described there. The biblical system, however, is unique. Purity and Danger remains an important book, and those who are drawn to read Leviticus as Literature would do well to (re-)read Douglas' earlier work, too. But the importance of Purity and Danger lies more in its overall methods (partic- ularly its fusion of functionalism and structuralism) and its advocacy of the sym- bolic value of ritual structures, and less in its specific descriptions of the social functions of purity systems. Leviticus as Literature-along with all of Douglas' recent work-demonstrates quite clearly that Purity and Danger does not ade- quately describe the functions of the biblical purity rules. But the implication to be drawn from this is not, and cannot be, that the purity system of the Pentateuch is unique in this regard. What of post-biblical Judaism? Are those New Testament scholars who apply Purity and Danger to their (mis-)understandings of the Phar- isees correct? And what of Islam? Shouldn't nearly all of what Mary Douglas has written of the biblical system in her newer work apply equally to the morally neu- tral purity system(s) of the Islamic tradition?20 Shouldn't ritual structures be ex- plained by their culturally-specific social functions and culturally-specific sym- bolic meanings? Some thirty-seven years after the publication of Purity and Danger, we are poised to reevaluate the specific comparative claims of that important work. Ironically, it is Douglas' own Leviticus as Literature that has brought us much closer to that point of reevaluation. Hyam Maccoby's book is quite different from Douglas', though he is also too focused on a single idea. Maccoby's primary interest in Ritual and Morality is to drive home the point that, as far as Judaism is concerned, ritual is completely separate from, and ultimately subordinate to, morality (pp. viii, 193-208). The problem with this claim-at least as far as Maccoby's book is concerned-is that 19.

See A. Kevin Reinhart, "Impurity/No Danger," History of Religions 30, no. 1 (1990): 1- 24. 96</page><page sequence="9">Review Essay his real interest lies in only a small aspect of this large (and important) question. We cannot evaluate briefly both this claim and his book in the same essay, for the fact is that Maccoby does very little-other than analyze the ritual purity system- to substantiate Judaism's separation of ritual from morality, or its subordination of the former to the latter. There are few discussions of Jewish ritual in general, and practically none concerning Jewish morality in general. Nor are there really discussions of Judaism as a whole, even in antiquity. Maccoby's interests are much more selective: he's interested in the purity system, as expressed in biblical and then rabbinic sources. Philo, Josephus, and a few of the Dead Sea scrolls (4QMMT and the Temple Scroll) come up periodically, but the interest in these works is not sustained. Other works that, one would think, are important to the history of ritual purity in ancient Judaism-Jubilees, the Damascus Document, the Testament of Levi, the Community Rule, the Habakkuk Pesher-are not discussed at all. It is a curious conception of ancient Judaism which can exclude all this literature, and still claim to speak authoritatively, even on ritual impurity specifically, let alone on matters as broad as ritual and morality. Maccoby's more limited goal-one at which he is much more successful- is to describe the history of the ritual purity system, as it develops from the Bible into the system of the rabbis (vii). He quickly (and justifiably) excludes the dietary prohibitions of Leviticus 11 from his focus (vii)-despite the fact that the terms "pure" and "impure" are used-except insofar as animal carcasses become a source of ritual impurity (Lev. 1 1:24ff.; pp. 67-80). His interest is in those purity rules which do not concern prohibitions: the laws laid out primarily in Leviticus 12-15 and Numbers 19. Here Maccoby agrees with Douglas and many other scholars in advocating that ritual impurity is not about the problematization of sin- ful behaviors. As Maccoby emphasizes quite frequently, many behaviors consid- ered ritually defiling are natural (e.g., childbirth) or even meritorious (e.g., burial). But unlike Douglas, Maccoby's interest is not just in the Pentateuch, but in how the few biblical chapters turn into the fully developed system of the rabbis. This is the history that Maccoby sets out to trace. Yet in something of a throwback to James Frazer, Maccoby's book is structured encyclopedically, with little regard for chronology. Each of the first 12 chapters (out of 16) is devoted to the history and development of a single aspect of purity law: Chapter One: The Corpse; Chapter Two: The tent; Chapter Three: Menstruation; and so forth. Within these chapters, Maccoby's scope is indeed quite broad: he reaches back into the prehistory of bib- lical law, and then looks forward into rabbinic and New Testament literature (though, as noted above, there are some significant omissions). In a number of these chapters, Maccoby raises important correctives to current scholarly ap- proaches to ritual impurity, in particular to the work of Jacob Milgrom and Jacob Neusner. In the end, Maccoby's book is practically the mirror image of Douglas'. If her devotion to a single good idea leads her to confuse or jumble some of the details, Maccoby, on the other hand, is most helpful in the realm of details. Regarding the nature of ritual impurity, Maccoby has some interesting and important things to say. In addition to emphasizing the points noted already, Mac- coby helpfully suggests that ritual purity regulations can be understood by analo- gy to palace etiquette (pp. 8-9, 206-208): just as there are certain things that one 97</page><page sequence="10">Jonathan Klawans simply would not do in the presence of an earthly monarch, so to there were things that ancient Israelites would not do in the presence of the God whose presence they wished to maintain among them. Ritual purity is about awe, not disgust (pp. 48, 66).21 Maccoby also correctly rejects the popular theory (advocated by Milgrom and Emanuel Feldman)22 that states that the common denominator among all the sources of ritual impurity in the Hebrew Bible is death. Maccoby is right to doubt whether the concern with death really explains all of ancient Israel's concerns with purity, especially since the only bodily fluids which defile are genital/sexual in na- ture (pp. 30-31, 49-50). As Maccoby puts it, the ritual purity system is one in which "both Eros and Thanatos are inextricably entwined" (p. ix). Maccoby also raises some helpful criticisms to the work of Jacob Neusner, underscoring how Neusner frequently fails to see biblical bases or precedents for rabbinic rules (e.g., pp. 96-100) and how Neusner has overemphasized the Sifra's alleged "anti-logic" ideology (pp. 59-60). These and other discussions in Ritual and Morality are marred merely by the fact that Maccoby tends to cite scholars only when he dis- agrees with them. Maccoby thus seems to claim here as his own points also made recently by a number of other scholars.23 Maccoby is justified in taking a particular interest in the work of Jacob Mil- grom, yet in at least one instance, his assessment of Milgrom tells us less about Milgrom than it does about Maccoby. One aspect of Milgrom's work which Mac- coby completely rejects is the "Dorian Gray" theory concerning the hattat sacri- fice. In a nutshell, Milgrom believes that the sacrifice commonly referred to as a "sin-offering" does not serve as a ritual of atonement, but rather as a ritual of purification. Further, what is purified, in Milgrom's view, is not the sinner who brings the sacrifice, but the altar of God, which is subject to defilement by sin.24 Maccoby criticizes Milgrom's understanding of things, citing a lack of evidence (p. 166). Of course, as Maccoby later grants (p. 167), Milgrom does have some evidence for his claim. But Maccoby's critique of Milgrom here ultimately fails because his own reconstructions of things are often based on little or no evidence. 21. Curiously, Maccoby leaves uncited the biblical text that best articulates the purity-as- etiquette view: Malachi 1:6-14. 22.

For example, in believing that ritual impurity can be explained by both death and sex, Mac- coby has been preceded by, among others, Tikva Frymer-Kensky and David P. Wright.

Leviticus 1-16, pp. 253-292. 98</page><page sequence="11">Review Essay When it comes to explaining various curiosities in the Israelite ritual purity sys- tem Maccoby speculates as he wishes, presenting elaborate reconstructions of the early history of scapegoat rites (pp. 81-93), the red cow rituals (pp. 94-117), and the purifications from leprosy (pp. 118-140). In each case, building on his earli- er work, The Sacred Executioner,25 Maccoby decides that certain features of the Israelite system are "vestiges of an ancient earth religion of generation, death and resurrection" (p. ix). These discussions are evolutionistic and neo-Frazerian, leav- ing this reader with the wish that Maccoby would reread the first two chapters of Purity and Danger. Even when attempting to explain less remote issues-such as the essence of the Jesus-Pharisee dispute in Mark 7:1-23-Maccoby is free to the- orize as he wishes, creatively contending that the Pharisees' rules about hand wash- ing were concerned not with ritual purity, but with hygiene (pp. 155-161). Yet when it comes to evaluating Milgrom's hypothesis about the hattat offering, Mac- coby draws the line on speculation. He will not even grant the possibility that Mil- grom's reconstruction could shed light on the pre-history of Israelite ritual purity laws. It cannot be speculation per se that bothers Maccoby. What bothers him is any speculation that violates his intent to keep separate ritual from morality, and to subordinate ritual to morality. Which brings us to one final question. What are we to do with Leviticus 18:24-30? How is Maccoby to make sense of a text which, after laying out a se- ries of sexual sins (18:6-23), explicitly describes the prohibited activities as abominations and impurities (18:20, 22, 24), having the capacity to defile the land (18:25)?26 Leviticus 18 raises serious problems for Maccoby's entire project, so toward the end of his book (pp. 200-201) he takes a few swipes at some of my own work and the view that the there was, alongside the "ritual" purity system, a second system, which can be called the "moral" purity system. Maccoby's first mistake is to present this suggestion as my idea, which it is not. Some sort of dis- tinction between ritual impurity on the one hand and the ideas expressed in Leviti- cus 18 on the other has been articulated recently by Tikva Frymer-Kensky and David P. Wright, and was described generations ago by David Z. Hoffmann and Adolph Biichler.27 Maccoby's second mistake is to follow in the line of Jacob Neusner (whose work is not cited here), and dismiss juxtapositions of impurity and sin as metaphor.28 Maccoby justifies this move by arguing (this is his third mis- take) that since land is personified in Leviticus 18:25, 28 ("lest the land vomit you out") that therefore the entire passage must be metaphorical. Now even if it were clear that land is being personified in these verses-I'll argue against that claim 25. The Sacred Executioner: Human Sacrifice and the Legacy of Guilt (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1982). 26. My own work has tried to show the degree to which the impact of the ideas articulated in Leviticus 18 and elsewhere were felt in subsequent ancient Jewish literature, from Jubilees to the Sifra. See, "Notions of Gentile Impurity in Ancient Judaism," AJS Review 20.2 (1995): 285-312, and Im- purity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). 27. See Frymer-Kensky, "Pollution," and Wright, "Unclean and Clean (OT)." Cf. Adolph Biich- ler, Studies in Sin andAtonement in the Rabbinic Literature of the First Century (London: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1928), and David Z. Hoffmann, Das Buch Leviticus, 2 vols. (Berlin: M. Poppelauer, 1905-6). Again, none of these works are discussed in Maccoby's book. 28. See Neusner, The Idea of Purity in Ancient Judaism (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973), esp. p. 108. 99</page><page sequence="12">Jonathan Klawans in a moment-it does not necessarily follow that the thrust of the entire passage is metaphorical, any more than the use of the euphemism "reveal the nakedness" in the rest of Leviticus 18 means that the prohibitions are meant tongue-in-cheek. Individual terms can be used metaphorically or figuratively even in sentences that need to be taken literally.29 But the fact is that there is no personification of the land in Leviticus 18.30 The verb translated by Maccoby as "to vomit" (xprr5) is indeed used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to refer to people (e.g., Prov. 23:8). But the term is also used of animals (Jonah 2:11; Prov. 26:11) and animals are, of course, fully capable of vomiting. There is certainly no personification in Jonah 2:11 or Prov. 26:11. Thus, we ought not, strictly speaking, describe Leviticus 18:25 as an instance of personification at all, but rather as a case of animification (cf. p. 201). And this is a meaningful description of the usage in Leviticus 18:25 only if Israelites generally conceived of land as inanimate. But did Israelites conceive of land as inanimate? I doubt it. Ancient Israelites knew well of earthquakes and volcanoes and they probably would have used terms such as the verb used in Leviti- cus 18:25 to describe such phenomena, without intending to be figurative or po- etic. All things considered, the NJV and the REB have it better: "and the land spewed out its inhabitants." This is a better translation, one which does not force the reader to think that land is being personified in the passage. It is Maccoby who has put the cart in front of the horse (p. 199). He has as- serted the absolute independence of ritual and morality, and assumed the absolute subordination of the former to the latter. Anything that violates either of these two views is to be dispensed with, and this can be achieved in one of two ways. He can ignore the texts altogether (e.g., Jubilees, the Community Rule), or he can dismiss as metaphor texts which, if taken at all seriously at all, challenge his claims. The metaphor issue remains, to be sure, subject to discussion. However, even if these texts were metaphorical, they must be discussed and accounted for. It is certainly not a simple thing to determine what is and what is not metaphorical, but only a facile and unsophisticated approach to metaphor can allow one to believe that the determination of some passage as metaphor allows one then to dismiss any and all discussion of that text from the subject at hand. Even if Leviticus 18 were entire- ly metaphorical, the history, nature, and meaning of that metaphor would still need to be discussed in a book that sets out to analyze either ritual purity specifically or morality more generally. Maccoby does not do this. In the end, his blanket as- sumptions that Jews and ancient Israelites, wherever and whenever they lived, dis- tinguished ritual from morality and always subordinated the latter to the former cannot be maintained. Those interested in Leviticus and purity will find reading Douglas' Leviti- cus as Literature a rewarding experience, especially if they are able to overlook Douglas' take on some of the details and focus on appreciating the significance of 29. This is frequently true of our own ways of discussing sexual matters. See Eilberg-Schwartz, The Savage, pp. 115-140, especially the examples on p. 118. 30. Maccoby is not alone in claiming that land is personified in Leviticus 18. The KJV, RSV, and NRSV translate our Hebrew term as "to vomit."

Reading Maccoby's Ritual and Morality will provide a more frustrat- ing experience, as one will have to overlook much of what he leaves unsubstanti- ated in order to find those aspects of his argument that are well supported. But if either book is to be read, each can perhaps be most rewardingly read alongside Mary Douglas' Purity and Danger, a work that truly deserves reading and reread- ing.
