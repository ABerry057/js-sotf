<plain_text><page sequence="1">438 BOOK REVIEWS Steven J. Zipperstein. Elusive Prophet: Ahad Ha'am and the Origins of Zionism. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993. xxv, 386 pp. In the pantheon of Zionist history, Asher Ginzberg, known by his pen- name Ahad Ha'am, rests alone. Nearly a century from the period of his most productive work, he still offers the hope of a Judaism that is not encompassed by religion and controlled by rabbis, and of a Jewish nationalism that is more than power politics. Whereas Herzl's political Zionism helped to lay the foundations of the state, and the socialist Zionists of the second aliyah began to construct a new society, economy, and political system, Ahad Ha'am remains associated with the dreams of cultural Zionism. For Ahad Ha'am, Zionism was a Judaic cultural renaissance. Steven Zipperstein's biography paints a complex portrait. Born the child of rich and well-connected parents-his father an honored guest at the court of the Sadagora Rebbe, his mother a niece of the Lubavitcher Rebbe-Ahad Ha'am became the leader of a generation of former yeshiva students who rejected the established religion of their communities and sought to master modern European culture. Always a dedicated political strategist, he molded his closest associates into the Bnei Moshe, a secretive cadre, dedicated to control the Hovevei Zion, Jewish education in Palestine, and the future of Judaism. Ahad Ha'am's magic lay in his pen. His essays rocked the Zionist movement, criticizing the state of Jewish settlements in Palestine when the accepted wisdom allowed only for praise, introducing a concern over the place of the Arabs in the land of Israel when no other Zionist leader acknowledged their presence, attacking Herzl for offering no vision of a Judaic renaissance when nearly all other Zionists offered only paeans to the movement's first international leader. Ahad Ha'am's message attracted Hayim Nahman Bialik, Leon Motzkin, Chaim Weizmann, and other Zionist luminaries. It brought him to the keynote podium of several Zionist congresses and the editorship of Ha-Shiloah, the foremost Zionist journal at the turn of the century, and earned him the confidence of Weizmann, as the Zionist leader negotiated with the British over the terms of the Balfour Declaration. His reputation as an intellectual notwithstanding, however, Ahad Ha'am wrote no important works of scholarship. His best essays contain acerbic attacks and hints at a new vision, but no philosophical substance. Zipperstein</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 439 shows that Weizmann and the other leaders of the Democratic Faction used Ahad Ha'am as a cultural symbol in their battles with Herzl, but rejected their presumed mentor's message as vague and not practical. Ahad Ha'am's relationship to Judaism was particularly complicated; he rejected its beliefs and practices, and his descriptions of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe and Palestine ignore the presence of vast numbers of observant Jews, as if they had no place in Judaism's present or future. At the same time, he encouraged his followers to form themselves into a circle that mimicked a Hasidic court, presided over regular Friday night meals with them, served by his wife, who continued to maintain a kosher home, and dismissed out of hand the claims of Reform Judaism in the West. Not surprisingly, Ahad Ha'am's vision was most appealing to Jews like himself, just removed from the yeshivas and shtiblech of Eastern Europe. There was nothing shy about Ahad Ha'am's self-references. Taking Moses, Yohanan ben Zakkai, and Maimonides as explicit role models, he offered himself as the new leader who would transform Judaism for the new era. Zipperstein combines a careful reading of Ahad Ha'am's writings and the work of those who knew him, as well as a deep understanding of the social context of Odessa, the city in which Ahad Ha'am spent most of his adult life, and the Jewish colonies in Palestine, into a detailed picture that reflects the contradictions of his subject. He offers no sustained argument that disentangles the complexities of Ahad Ha'am's life and career. Only the attempt to clarify Ahad Ha'am's claims about the Arabs in Palestine (more a practical political problem than an ethical concern) serves as an analytic thread. No theories drawn from psychology guide the analysis of Ahad Ha'am's visions, activities, or family life. No theories from political science or sociology help to explain Ahad Ha'am's criticisms of the Jewish settlers, Herzl's political agenda, or the failure of the Bnei Moshe, or the use made of Ahad Ha'am by those who claimed to be his followers in Zionist politics. As Zipperstein details the extraordinary extent to which Ahad Ha'am's work is self-referential (he nicely shows how even the pen-name itself implies kingship) and poorly developed (many of the claims are made by assertions, in which the conclusions are found in the points of evidence), as well as driven by an obvious political logic, he implicitly underlines but does not answer the fundamental need to account for Ahad Ha' am's success in his own day and the hallowed place he has continued to hold in Zionist history for nearly a century. As the philosophical weaknesses of Ahad Ha'am's essays</page><page sequence="3">440 BOOK REVIEWS emerge, Zipperstein leads the reader to wonder about the meaning of cultural Zionism and any effort to create a Judaic renaissance that moves beyond the boundaries of Judaism as a religion. Steven Zipperstein has brought the study of Ahad Ha'am into the world of serious scholarship. He provides materials and analysis that dissolve the halos of Zionist hagiography and detail the complexities of this extraordinary person. He establishes the questions but offers no general framework to guide future research. No longer a prophet, Ahad Ha'am remains elusive. Alan S.
