<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review Moshe Pelli. Kinds of Genre in Haskalah Literature: Types and Topics. Israel: Hakkibutz Hameuchad Publishing House, 1999. xxv (English), 357 pp. (Hebrew). Moshe Pelli, one of the major scholars of Hebrew Haskalah (Enlightenment) literature in our time and one of the major contributors to Hebrew culture in Amer- ica, presents in this book the fruits of his twenty-five years of study of the major genres in this literature. Previously published articles have been rewritten by Pel- li for this book. One tendency of Haskalah literature was to adopt Judaic genres, such as the fable and the religious disputation, which existed in earlier Hebrew literature be- fore the Haskalah and were continued by the Haskalah. Another trend was to use as a model genres that prevailed in European literatures in order to revitalize He- brew belles lettres. Pelli presents an overview and a detailed discussion of the unique features of each one of these genres in order to present Haskalah as a mod- em, European-like phenomenon. Each of the ten chapters of the book is dedicated to one genre-biography, au- tobiography, utopia, satire, dialogues of the dead, fable, religious disputation, the epis- tolary story, the imaginary dialogue and the travelogue-though it is clear that sever- al genres may be traced in a single literary work. These genres helped to promote the aims and ideology of the Haskalah and provided new modes of literary expression. Two works of Isaac Euchel present the genre of biography: his biography of Mendelssohn, published as a book in 1789, and his biography of Isaac Abravanel. Mendelssohn is portrayed as a model of the ideal modem Jew, embodying Haska- lah and Judaism. Abravanel, who achieved balance between Judaism and the cul- ture around him, is also presented as an exemplary figure for the Maskilim. The genre of autobiography is represented by Mordechai Aharon Ginzburg's Aviezer, written in the 1820s and published in 1864. Ginzburg employs a variety of literary devices such as parables, epigrams, digressions, anecdotes and didactic allusions in his story, and strives for truth and criticism that will benefit the society. The genre of utopia attracted the Haskalah writers who wanted to draw a new, ideal type of Jewish society; the utopian genre made it possible for them to portray it as if it actually existed. Euchel's "Igrot Meshulam" and Isaac Satanow's Divre Rivot represents this genre. "Igrot Meshulam" is an epistolary story, satire and utopia. Euchel viewed the limited observance of the Marranos in Spain, the aesthetic aspects of the Catholic worship services, and the progressive life of Ital- ian Jews as utopian models for secular Jewish life and alternatives to traditional Ju- daism. Satanow's Divre Rivot portrays a utopian society in which the king's re- forms of Jewish life change human relations, economy, education, and society; the changes resonate with the Haskalah's ideals. Pelli meticulously presents the satiric modes of Saul Berlin's 1794 Ktav Yosher, including its structure, figurative language, and secularization of sacred id- ioms, as well as its use of irony, sarcasm, invective, obscenity, hyperbole, incon- gruity, reductio ad absurdum, caricature, wit, and humor. Ktav Yosher was written in defense of Naphtali Herz Wessely's treatise on education and displays the de- generating state of the Jewish society. When Pelli analyzes Erter's satire "Gilgul 168</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Nefesh" he also offers a re-evaluation of Erter's literary achievements. In this work the protagonist undergoes transformations into nine human characters and eight animals, through which the author relates to the problems of Jewish life. The dialogues of the dead genre was adopted by several Haskalah writers who were attracted to its dramatic debate and search for truth of historical and con- temporary figures in the afterlife. Pelli analyzes the satiric dialogue of Aaron Wolfssohn's "Sihah Ba-Eretz Ha-Hayyim," published in 1794, and Tuvyah Feder's Qol Mehatzetzim, published in 1853 and 1875. In Wolfssohn's dialogues, the dis- cussion is between Maimonides, Mendelssohn, and a Polish rabbi. Wolfssohn pre- sents contemporary topics, especially the controversies between the Haskalah and its opponents. The participants in Feder's dialogue are historical figures and ma- jor figures of the Haskalah, who attack Mendel Lefin's translation of the Book of Proverbs into Yiddish. The choice of Yiddish rather than German seemed to Fed- er an act of disloyalty to the Haskalah 's dedication to high standards of culture. The didactic nature of the fable, its entertaining aspect, its search for truth, and its compactness explain why Haskalah writers liked this genre. In his 1793 or 1794 Divre Rivot, Isaac Satanow adapted the style of religious disputation of Ju- dah Halevi's Kuzari and used various literary devices to achieve dramatic tension. The first epistolary fiction writing in modem Hebrew literature is Isaac Euchel's "Igrot Meshulam," published anonymously in the Hebrew monthly Hameassef It includes various fictional letters with different opinions but supports the ideas of the Haskalah. Pelli disagrees with the opinion that Euchel's work is a "free trans- lation" of Montesquieu's Lettres persanes and substantiates his view that the au- thor of "Igrot Meshulam" is Euchel, who followed Montesquieu's use of the epis- tolary genre but expressed his own personal experience. The imaginary dialogue is illustrated by Baruch Jeitteles' 1800 dialogue be- tween the year 1800 and the year 1801. The speakers are the two years and they both attack the mystical Frankist sect. The genre of travelogue, which aims both to teach and to entertain, is represented by Shmuel Romanelli's 1792 Masa Ba- Arav, a travelogue of the author's journey to North Africa. Pelli presents the liter- ary conventions of the Haskalah travelogue and the life of North African Jews from the Haskalah point of view. While the kinds of genre in Haskalah literature are the focal point of Pelli's book, they are far from being its only subject matter. Pelli presents major authors, major literary works, major problems, developments and aspirations of the Haskalah, using his immense knowledge of this literature. He passionately and skillfully advocates and highlights its achievements. His extensive bibliography (pp. 328-351) is useful. The cultural and literary parameters of his discussion are expansive. His way of disagreement with other scholars is amiable. Pelli's erudition and inquisitive mind are evidenced in each chapter. His analysis is artful. Pelli raises one important question after another and answers each. For example, of the fable he asks and answers the following: Why was the fable such a popular genre? What transformation did it undergo? How does the definition of the fable genre by Haskalah fabulists stand in comparison with their European counterparts? In what ways was the affinity of the Haskalah 's fable to 169</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review the classical Hebrew fable expressed? How should Haskalah's fables be classified? Were all the "original fables" original? In his presentation of the unique attributes of each genre, Pelli applies liter- ary theory, probes the affinity between the Haskalah genre and the European genre, and analyzes the literary qualities and merits and traits of each genre in Haskalah literature vis-A-vis its counterparts on the European scene. This is, in short, a most significant contribution to the research of Haskalah literature. Lev Hakak UCLA Los Angeles, California</page></plain_text>
