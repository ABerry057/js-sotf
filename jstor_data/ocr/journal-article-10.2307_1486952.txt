It is certainly true of</page><page sequence="2">294 BOOK REVIEWS Poverty and Charity in Roman Palestine. The first flaw is the title: the book has only 60 or so pages (the final three chapters) on the announced topic, and these are by far the weakest and least important part of the book (I will say no more about them; for criticism, see M. Goodman, Journal of Theo- logical Studies 42 [1991]: 299-301). But the bulk of it is a comprehensive, largely convincing, and in parts fundamentally significant phenomenologi- cal (rather than historical) account of country life in Roman Palestine. The first two chapters, which are heavily dependent on S. Krauss's Tal- mudische Archdologie (1910-12) and similar works, describe the food and clothing normally used in Roman Palestine. The third and fourth chapters, which constitute the book's real contribution, concern climatic, technologi- cal, and other conditions of Palestinian agriculture, and attempt to assess the economic burden in the form of taxes and rents on the average peasant. Incidentally, this concentration on the peasantry in a book which claims to describe "the social world of Roman Palestine" (p. 2) as a whole, is another of the book's flaws, though a more or less pardonable one; most inhabitants of Palestine were peasants, notwithstanding the accelerated pace of urbani- zation starting in the later second century. These chapters have other problems as well. They are replete with mis- citations, mistranslations, and misunderstanding of the mostly rabbinic sources. Most common are the first, examples of which can be found on almost every page. Mistranslations, especially of the Yerushalmi, are only slightly less abundant. Two particularly egregious examples: on p. 12, the statement attributed to R. Hiya b. R. Ba in Y. Eruvin 20d is taken as the pronouncement of a gourmet (Hamel is French); on p. 84, n. 198, the phrase millame' benega'im is translated as if it were metame' bemaga'. Hamel's grasp of Jewish law is often uncertain. The rabbis did not, for example, declare vetch subject to terumah only in times of famine (p. 16); it is surpris- ing to find (pp. 20-21) that Jewish peasants cooked their chicken in milk (perhaps they did so, but Hamel actually cites as evidence only M. Hullin 8:1, which prohibits the practice!) and drank donkey's and camel's milk (again without evidence); and in what sense was the Fifteenth of Av, in di- rect contradiction of M. Taanit 4:8, a day of sadness (p. 85)? But it would be a serious mistake to dismiss the book because of such errors, numerous though they are. For one thing, they are usually incon- sequential.' For another, Hamel does not pretend to have produced a phi- 1. An exception is Hamel's consistent and damaging misconception of the laws of ritual purity, especially important in the little semiotic and/or anthropological sections which punc-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 295 logical commentary on talmudic realia a la S. Lieberman or D. Sperber. Rather, his goal is more ambitious (see above), and his unsentimental appre- ciation of the harsh lot of ancient peasants in a dry country with a hierarchi- cal social structure, not to mention his wide reading in and judicious utiliza- tion of scholarship on the social history and anthropology of preindustrial Mediterranean and other societies, more than compensates for his trivial misunderstandings of the sources. Indeed, Hamel has attained his goal with a remarkable measure of suc- cess. His most significant conclusions concern agricultural yields and econo- mic burdens, especially on small independent and tenant farmers, in chapters 3 and 4. These chapters contain by far the best discussions of these issues I have seen, and Hamel's findings are highly consequential. He argues convincingly that the average ratio of wheat harvested to that sown was 5:1 (estimates have generally ranged from 10:1 to 100:1), and for hardier but less nourishing barley slightly higher (yields for legumes, olives, and grapes are incalculable). Subtracting from this his plausible estimates of taxes (though terumot and ma'aserot were probably less regularly paid in many places and at many times than Hamel supposes) and rents, he concludes that a small or middle-size farmer or sharecropper had on the average just enough to sub- sist. Indebtedness and malnutrition were necessarily regular facts of life for many. Hamel does not draw the historical conclusions from this, but they are clear enough. The Palestinian economy was fragile, even by ancient standards. This fragility was exacerbated by the Jews' notorious failure to practice child-exposure (though some surely did practice it), and their ten- dency (perhaps exaggerated in both ancient and modern literature) to save the most economically marginal elements of society from starvation. These facts do more to explain the tumultuous character of the history of ancient Palestine down to the great slaughter of 135 C.E. than a hundred volumes of modern scholarship describing the inherent incompatibility of Judaism and foreign rule, and other such theological fantasies. They may also explain thei willingness of very large numbers of Jews to leave home without any neces- sary connection to the political situation there, and so, the existence of a large diaspora.

Even apart from this consideration, these sections are often either hopelessly opaque (e.g., pp. 25-29 on the meaning of meat) or obvious, if not simply mistaken (pp. 81-92, on the colors of clothing).</page><page sequence="4">296 BOOK REVIEWS This is, at least for four chapters, a vitally important book for anyone working on any aspect of ancient Judaism, including its literature; it is a highly original, compellingly gritty description of the conditions of real life in ancient Palestine. So, check the references, ignore the translations, skip the last chapters, but read the book! Seth Schwartz University of Rhode Island Kingston, R.I.</page></plain_text>
