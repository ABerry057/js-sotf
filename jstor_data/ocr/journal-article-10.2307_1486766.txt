In the introduction, after outlining the shortcomings of previous generations of scholarship on rabbis (pp. 1-36) and discussing social-historical and sociological approaches to ancient society (pp. 36-42), Hezser briefly discusses her own approach (pp. 43-51). Part I (pp. 53-154) considers the "boundaries" of the rabbinic movement, including such questions as the usage of the term "rabbi," the problem of rabbinic "ordination" (it did not exist as such) and bans, rabbinic comportment, and the general absence of evidence from Greek and Latin literary sources. Part II (pp. 155-327) turns to relationships between rabbis, arguing that rabbis had no one center, although cities may have had larger numbers of rabbis, and had no "permanent judicial and/or educational bodies in the form of a central court or sanhedrin and/or academies" (p. 185), but were organized in a loose network of informal relationships that decreased in intensity as one moves outward from any one rabbi. In addition, Hezser discusses the evidence for conflict and agreement between rabbis and for differences of status (including but not limited to wealth), and proposes that such terms as "house" or "fellows" describe no more than the household (including disciples) and more intensive "social clusters" of individual rabbis. Part III (pp. 329-489) considers aspects of rabbinic patronage systems: relations between rabbis and students (including competition among disci- ples), rabbis and the community (discussing evidence both for adherence to and disregard of rabbis, and rabbinic attitudes on service to the community), and rabbis and the patriarch; noninstitutional sources of rabbinic authority (e.g., their connection to Torah, their ability to give guidance, as well as their individual reputations, see p. 461); and the existence of potential competitors to rabbis (e.g., scribes, other judges, and priests). A lucid summary (pp. 491-497) concludes the book. Hezser's work is resolutely philological (with extended discussions of the terms "rabbi," pp. 55-62; "elder," pp. 277-286; and gdd61/q.tan and related terms, pp. 301-306), and large portions of the work read as reviews of set-pieces of traditional scholarship (e.g., much of Part I and the discussion of the patriarchate in Part III). However, the real contribution of the work is its consistent application of network theory to dismantle both ancient literary</page><page sequence="3">380 BOOK REVIEWS and contemporary scholarly conventions about rabbinic relationships and authority. There is certainly room for scholarly dissent over particular issues, such as the extent and significance of rabbinic connections with cities (pp. 157-161 and elsewhere), the degree of rabbinic wealth (pp. 256-257), the understanding of "study houses" as not particularly rabbinic institutions that rabbis merely happened to use (pp. 195-214), and the extent to which the literary tradition itself may be the product of a greater degree of consolidation and corporate identity than Hezser assumes. In general, there is room left in Hezser's discussion for greater attention to class and economic structure both in her citation of rabbinic texts (e.g., pp. 101, 137, 456-457, in connection with rabbis as an "intellectual elite") and in her various cross-references between rabbinic and "Greco-Roman" (generally elite) society (e.g., pp. 130-132, 166, 211-212, 310, 319-320, 329-331, 341-342, 349, 400). Nevertheless, the systematic attention that Hezser pays to those aspects of rabbinic interactions that presuppose a loosely bound and shifting network of personal relationships is a crucial step forward for the field. For this reason, the lack of an extended discussion and critique of network theory (described in scattered sections of the book: pp. 48, 233-237, 251-252, 322, 324-327 form a partial list) and of its applicability and limitations is a particular disappointment. (For instance, to apply the observation that links climate, marketing, and intensity of relationships, p. 237, requires a discussion of the extent and social distribution of commercialization in the economy of Roman Palestine and how these may structure social interactions.) In addition, although Hezser is acutely aware of methodological problems related to the historiographical use of rabbinic traditions (see esp. pp. 43-47), a more detailed discussion of her own strategies for determining when, for instance, apparent differences between tannaitic and amoraic reports can be interpreted as reflecting real change over time (e.g., in connection with primary education, pp. 94-96, 100-101, 102, 106) and when they cannot (e.g., in connection with rabbinic study in private houses in the amoraic period, pp. 209-210) would have been a useful addition. These observations notwithstanding, this book makes a contribution to the study of Palestinian rabbis that is as impressive as it is important.
