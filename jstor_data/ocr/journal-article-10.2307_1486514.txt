<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naomi B. Sokoloff. Imagining the Child in Modern Jewish Fiction. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. xiv, 234 pp. The Bildungsroman is of course a major genre and has long had an honored place in the history of at least the Western or European novel. In Imagining the Child in Modern Jewish Fiction, Naomi Sokoloff has undertaken to explore a "subgenre" of the Bildungsroman: what she finds taking shape in Sholem Aleichem's Mottel, H. N. Bialik's Aftergrowth, Henry Roth's Call It Sleep, Jerzy Kosinski's Painted Bird, Aharon Appelfeld's Age of Wonders, David Grossman's See Under: Love, A. B. Yehoshua's A Poet's Continuing Silence, and Gynthia Ozick's Cannibal Galaxy-an arresting and engaging array of writings which only an extremely bold and well prepared critic would think of addressing. Shevah (praise) first and then tefillah (in this context, it must be complaint): it is a bit curious that, Ozick's Beulah Lilt excepted, the child figures which Sokoloff analyzes are all males, but the book in its conceptual grasp and what I won't hesitate to call its passion must arouse great respect. Sokoloff has produced a serious study which is anything</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 261 but pedestrian and which indeed offers a great many brilliant apergus. Her recognition, influenced by Gershon Shaked, that "narratives of childhood concerned with a young figure's search for a personal voice.., contribute to a wider phenomenon in modern Jewish literature of restless seeking for self-definition" (p. xi) could serve as an epigraph for her book. She argues persuasively, moreover, that "the discourse of childhood, . . . with its peculiarly fictive voice and its acts of literary ventriloquism, becomes an apt forum for inventing and sounding new self-conceptions, and bringing those ideas into dialogue with Jewish traditions and historical transformations" (p. 40). What Sokoloff describes as "Mottel's challenge to conventional" Yiddish is a case in point. Crossing the Czarist border en route to America was often a matter of ganvenen (stealing across), but young Mottel misunderstands the expression: Di grenets hob ich gemeynt iz mit herner-he thinks the border is a horned beast. "His literalizing, as it comically personifies the border, making it seem strange, prefaces a more thorough undoing of assumptions" and "puts into question the values of the old social order" (p. 54). Something similar is reflected in Bialik's equally naive Shmulik, who, as Sokoloff says, "sees 'otherwise' the religious texts of Judaism," thus "stands outside the tradition" and only later "comes to appropriate it into his own imagination" (p. 67). Sokoloff is very good on such situations. Her treatment of the pre-adolescent Davey's "privileged moments of insight or epiphany"-bordering, as she notes, on "mystical vision" (p. 90)-in Roth's Call It Sleep is also most satisfactory: she understands how Roth, in his vision of the child, creates him so masterfully as to imply "at least some endorsement of the worth of [Davey's] inner voice" (p. 91). She is also clear on Kosinski's strategy in his amazing Holocaust novel The Painted Bird: the novel "posits a naturalization of evil"; "Kosinski cultivates the child more as a narrative device than as a psychological portrait," thought he "does give some play to the Boy's imagination" and thereby enables his novel to offer "the impression of an equivocal reality," an achievement akin to "the celebrated magic realism of Latin American literature" (p. 110). Appelfeld's Holocaust fiction The Age of Wonders also employs a child's sensibility to project ambiguity, "an ambiguity fundamental to Appelfeld's aim of creating an art that both reveals and conceals" (p. 134). The child "flickers back and forth between feeling at a loss and entertaining prescient intimations of what the future holds"</page><page sequence="3">262 BOOK REVIEWS (p. 135). In David Grossman's Holocaust-related novel, she points out, since Momik's "words are retained within the voice of the narrator, his immature thoughts cannot be readily dismissed as childish prattle" (p. 157). Grossman's delicacy is reminiscent of Roth's approach in Call It Sleep. Momik's strenuous efforts to make sense of his parents' experience in erez sham ("there" in the Nazi camps) may lead him to conclusions which are "inadequate or comically distorted, and his innocence may raise smiles," but Grossman does not blur "the impressive sensitivity and complexity of [Momik's] mental life" (p. 157). Again, Sokoloff deals exceptionally well with this theme. Still, in my judgment, complaint is unavoidable. Too often the book inspires an impression that it has not been sufficiently emancipated from what I take to be its dissertational beginnings. There is perhaps too much, explicitly, of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of dialogic imagination, too much of Jacques Lacan, too much of "privilege" and "privileging" and too much of unduly burdensome language, as in her comment on Momik's consciousness in See Under: Love-"To chart the process of discovery that the child character undergoes in this fiction, the representation of Momik's consciousness relies on combinations of psychonarration and narrated monologue. These are the terms Dorrit Cohn uses to classify, first of all, accounts of a character's inner life by an authorial voice and, second, the rendering of a character's thought in its own idiom while maintaining third-person narration" (p. 155). Or again on "psychonarration," which, Sokoloff writes, "approaches narrated monologue and vice versa as the two incorporate into themselves varying amounts of the child character's idiolect. This quality of the prose complements and amplifies one of the peculiar properties of narrated monologue itself. As a technique of storytelling that blurs distinction between who sees and who tells, it discourages disentaglement of focalizations and utterances. The resulting conflation of perspectives allows subtle modulations that favor emphasis on either child or adult views" (p. 159). Surely I myself have been guilty of such mandarinism from time to time, but here a work that might be characterized as superior has been regrettably marred. It is, to be sure, not only the author's fault; it is a matter of the publisher's editorial standards as well. At the very least such locutions should have been relegated to the notes. In any event, so I allow myself to hope, the shevah I am willing to express outweighs the deploring tefillah.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 263 Sokoloff's study will reward patient readers, especially, those who have been exposed to the fictions she discusses with indisputable intelligence and earnestness.
