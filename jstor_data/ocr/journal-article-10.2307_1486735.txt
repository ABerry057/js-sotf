Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993. xxi, 327 pp. Moshe Weinfeld here once again extends to new areas the two enter- prises he began twenty-five years ago in his big book on Deuteronomy:' (1) uncovering the layers of tradition in the Hebrew Bible, moving back from the Deuteronomic school; and (2) elaborating a new academic specialty, previously (to the best of my knowledge) unnamed by others or by himself: international juristic formulae. The University of California Press has hand- somely printed up this expansion of his Taubman Lectures (which I heard with much profit in 1989), except that seemingly no proofreader could be found to get a few lines of Greek printed correctly (see pp. 5, 21, 207). Of nine chapters, six (3 through 8) analyze a later and an earlier stratum of concepts relating to the "inheritance of the land," not unknown to biblical scholarship; I outline these more briefly, and then in the style of a mini review-article chronicle Weinfeld's one-man progressive discovery of international juristic formulae. Chapter 3 lays out two successive views of the borders of the land: the earlier restricted system of the Priestly Code, from Lebo-Hamath to the wadi of Egypt, excluding the east bank of the Jordan; and the Deuteronomic, which extends them from the Euphrates to the Nile. Chapter 4 finds two successive views about the status of the Canaanites: in the Covenant Code of Exodus 21-23 they are simply to be dispossessed; in Deuteronomy, annihilated. Weinfeld observes (p. 213) that in the Second Temple period, The concept of totally annihilating the Canaanite population was viewed with great reservation, and there was a desire to depict relations with the Canaanites in terms of peaceful negotiations. Even more, the emphasis on the territorial essence of the land of Israel and the Jewish people was replaced by new spiritual, non-territorial definitions. 1. Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972). 105</page><page sequence="2">106 BOOK REVIEWS It would be interesting to know how Israelis today hear those two contrasts. Chapter 5 lays out three views about the nature of the conquest: that of Albright's school, which sees it as military, in line with the book of Joshua that of Alt and Noth, which sees it as a peaceful settlement in uninhabited areas; and that of Mendenhall and Gottwald, which sees the Israelites as already in Canaan. Weinfeld attempts a synthesis. Chapters 6 and 7 attempt to show that the summary of the settlement in Judges 1:1-2:5 is as tendentious as that of Joshua and ambitiously strive to work back to what really happened. Chapter 8 analyzes a shift from seeing the inheritance as an unconditional promise to a conditioned obligation. When the Hittite and Akkadian "loyalty" treaties were first discovered, defining the relationship of the "vassal" to the Great King, it became apparent that the covenantal formulae of the Hebrew Bible were closely patterned on the treaties, with Israel playing the role of vassal to its God, the "Great King" (Psalms 95:3). Weinfeld's book on Deuteronomy does not extend much beyond that analysis. His originality appears in his later insight that the Near Eastern formulae of the treaty, by definition the primary document shared between cultures, equally appear in the large corpus of Greek and Roman treaties, both as recorded in the historians and on stone. In two seminal articles he documented the manner in which the provisions of the treaty generally,2 and the loyalty oath in the "vassal" treaty between unequals,3 are reflected in Greco-Roman treaties and oaths of allegiance. Since then, Weinfeld in brief studies has unearthed parallels between the Near East and the Greco-Roman world in instructions for temple visitors;4 in the internal discipline of the Qumran sectaries and Hellenistic guilds;5 and in the conduct of a census.6 In the beautiful book which preceded this 2.

In each of these cases he has suggested plausible routes by which the usage could have passed from east to west. In the book under review, the ninth and final chapter ("The Covenantal Aspect of the Promise of the Land to Israel") identifies a second type of Hebrew covenant, "promissory" as contrasted with "obligatory," derived from the grant formulae of ancient Near Eastern kings; here too there is a nice Latin parallel.' The initial chapters contain Weinfeld's most massive novelty to date: an extensive comparison of the pattern of Israelite settlement in the Promised Land with Vergil's language about the settlement of Aeneas in Italy! Previously Cyrus Gordon had listed literary parallels between the Hebrew Bible and the Aeneid without proposing an explanation.'0 Weinfeld shows (p. 21) that the language of the Aeneid must reflect Greek colonization, and that it in turn reflects two phases of Phoenician colonization: The first phase comprises the beginning of a connection with the indigenous population (for purposes of trade), which is followed by a second phase involving a great influx of new settlers into the area and representing real colonization. These two stages are reflected in the traditions of both Roman and Israelite history. In chapter 1, "The Patriarchal Stories in the Light of Greek Foundation Stories," Weinfeld works out "the Aeneas-Abraham analogy" with seven points: (1) a man leaving a great civilization and charged with a universal mission; (2) the gap between the ancestor's migration and the actual foun- dation; (3) a promise at stake; (4) the pious ancestor; (5) the ancestral gods (sacra and teraphim); (6) the burial place of the founder; (7) Canaan versus 7.

Weinfeld's Greek example (p. 9) can be somewhat improved: see the parallel of dike and themis "justice and law" at Odyssey 9.215, Pindar Isthmian 9 fragment. 9. With "confirm a treaty" (nl613 ,iepn, e.g. Genesis 6:18) Weinfeld compares Latinfoedus firmare (p. 235), which I can document at Vergil Aeneid 12.212firmabantfoedera. 10. Cyrus H.

The suggestiveness of his work is enhanced when it opens up vistas for others to enter. Thus (p. 5) with the promise to Abraham he compares the promise to Aeneas (Vergil Aen. 3.97-98, resting on a late Hellenistic reading of Iliad 20.307-8): Hic domus Aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis. Here shall the house of Aeneas rule over all shores, both the sons of sons and those who shall be born of them. We may further compare the Hebraic idiom "the house of Israel" and Ezekiel 37:25 ". .. they and their sons and the sons of their sons shall dwell there for ever." In chapter 2, "The Pattern of Israelite Settlement: A Comparison with the Pattern of Greek Colonization," he notes common elements as follows: (1) inquiry at the shrine (Delphi and Shiloh); (2) priestly guidance (Eleazer and the "seer" of Cyrene); (3) divine obligations (leges sacrae and the Pentateuch); (4) the founder's tomb; (5); naming the land; (6) dividing the land (by lot); (7) divine promise (YHWH and Apollo at Cyrene); (8) setting up stones; (9) building an altar. The parallels listed under each item warrant careful study. Of all the languages of the eastern Mediterranean, Hebrew and Greek (with its daughter Latin) are by far the most accurately written, carefully preserved, and best understood; cultural parallels elsewhere conjectural here can be precisely documented. It is remarkable that the international juristic formulae all operated solely in translation; they contain none of the common vocabulary which in other areas demands comparative treatment. Much unexplored territory remains! To the best of my knowledge (but I do not have his complete bibliography), Weinfeld has not treated connections between the Roman Tabulae XII and ancient Near Eastern law codes." All readers will join me, I am sure, in wishing him many fruitful further years of cultural exploration. John Pairman Brown Berkeley, Calif. 11. See Raymond Westbrook, "The Nature and Origin of the Twelve Tables," Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftungftir Rechtsgeschichte, Romanistische Abteilung 105 (1988): 74-121. Westbrook compares, on the one hand, the casuistic method of the Roman Twelve Tables, the Akkadian codes, and the Covenant (Exodus 21-22) and Deuteronomic (Deuteronomy 21-25) Codes; on the other hand, the "scientific" method shared by Gaius and the Mishna.</page></plain_text>
