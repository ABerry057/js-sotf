<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJSReview 28:1 (2004), 63-82 ISRAELI DRAMA AND THE BIBLE: KINGS ON THE STAGE by Glenda Abramson Drama is the most neglected genre within Hebrew cultural development. In fact, until shortly before the foundation of the State of Israel, few plays in Hebrew had been staged. Although a large number of works in dramatic form had been written, particularly in the nineteenth century, few of them were viable theatrical dramas. They fell into the categories of rhetoric and allegory, devoid of believable dramatis personae. There were some milestones along the way, such as Somi's Za- hut Bedihuta de-Kiddushin (An Eloquent Marriage Farce, c. 1600), Luzzatto's Leyesharim tehilla (Praise for the Righteous, 1743), and some modern plays, but these were not sufficiently feasible for the establishment of a dramatic tradition. An important factor qualifying the late development of Hebrew drama was the lan- guage, for within the communities' diglossia throughout the ages, Hebrew was re- served for more elevated discourse than playacting. Moreover, Hebrew, the language of the sacred texts, was inadequate for the expression of everyday life. Nowhere in the diaspora was there a Hebrew-speaking audience; there was no folk life in Hebrew as there was in Yiddish. Also, the potential playwrights were faced with the problem of the divine imperative in Jewish history, which precludes any- thing like the theodicy that gave rise to classical tragedy. Other religious restric- tions against certain forms of representation, together with the small value Jewish religious authorities traditionally placed on theatre for its own sake, were also cru- cial factors mitigating against the drama's development. Two of the most important prerequisites for the development of a dramatic tradition are land and language.' The Israeli scholar Ittamar Even-Zohar sees "Is- raelness" in literature as a simple belonging to a place, to the population of this place, its language and its culture. It is safe to assume that the internal changes that took place in the character of Hebrew literature in Israel are for the most part a result of factors involved in territorial transition, such as the revitalization of the language, the 1.

Consequently, for many decades it suffered an alien status within contemporary Hebrew literature. This attitude has changed in recent years in view of the emergence of out- standing Hebrew playwrights and the evolution of a Hebrew dramatic canon. Among the most gifted of the contemporary Israeli dramatists was Hanokh Levin, who died in 2000. Levin, who was commonly considered to be the infant terrible of the Israeli stage, began his career as a political satirist and later wrote a number of plays which revealed a much more profound grasp of human affairs. In these later plays Levin utilized the fundamental elements of theatre itself: archetypal characters and myths and biblical tales through which he offered his vision of the violence of modem existence in general and of twentieth-century Jewish fate in particular. One of these plays was Yisurei Iyov (The Torments ofJob, 1981), based on the Book of Job, which took a view of Job as a modem victim of catastrophe. After the disasters that befall him, Levin's Job renounces his faith in God and dies impaled on a stake while Jesus walks by, dragging his cross. The language through- out the play is portentous verse that recalls biblical cadences. The point is that even towards the end of the twentieth century, the most iconoclastic of Israeli play- wrights returned to the Bible and, through the biblical narrative itself, provided a dystopian vision for Israeli audiences. Levin demonstrated his instinctive understanding of theatre by his use of rit- ual structure; rite and myth form the basis of all good drama. According to Sartre's notes, written in 1946 for his "theatre of moral commitment," theatre is a collec- tive, religious phenomenon, exploring humanity in a moral, mythic framework. It attempts to show the public the elemental myths of death, exile, and love. Its char- acters are people of flesh and blood whose tragic experiences are complete in them- selves; yet they can serve as the embodiment of all similar experiences. The theatre is, according to Sartre, and must remain, a rite.3 The unchanging nature of myth allows authors to use traditional material-love, conflict, tyranny, fate, and hu- manity's relationship with God-to explore and interpret the modern world. Be- cause myths are stories told by a certain society, reflecting the way in which it experiences its own history, they serve both to interpret and to construct its par- ticular view of the world. Consequently, at critical times a society will call upon myth, legend, or ancient history to clarify events. Myth is therefore used as a prism through which to see reality. While one cannot place the Bible as a whole into the 2. Itamar Even-Zohar: "Hasifrut ha'ivrit hayisra'elit: model histori." Hasifrut, vol. 4, no. 3, July 1973, p. 432. 3.

II Hanokh Levin's drama appeared late in the tradition of biblical reconstructions in dramatic form. Throughout Jewish cultural history, Hebrew dramatic allegories had taken their subjects from the Bible, either retelling the biblical narrative or using it to exemplify or emphasise moral standpoints.4 Of the forty-six Hebrew plays from 1642-1887 listed under "Drama, Hebrew" in The Jewish Encyclopedia, twenty-five are on biblical topics.5 One of the most noteworthy of these plays was Joseph Ha'efrati's Melukhat Shaul (Saul 's Kingdom, 1794), which dramatized the tragedy of Saul, showing the human side of the tormented king rather than his power alone. An important trend in Haskalah drama was the translation into Hebrew and adapta- tion of European plays on biblical themes, in addition to the composition of original biblical drama. However, even this later period did not produce any real dramatists. Gershon Shaked defines three methods of composition of biblical-historical drama, which had consolidated by the "revival" period: the archaeological method, which often presents historical melodramas in an exotic setting as "the exotic im- age of the east"6; the actualistic method, which perpetuates the allegorical tradi- tion in order to present a drama of ideas7; and the third method, which is to rewrite the past in a new context.8 Generally, however, early dramatists did little more than render sections of the biblical narrative into dialogue without attempting to inter- pret the text. Even in the 1920s and 1930s, the lack of knowledge of dramatic form and stagecraft prevented the realization of the playwright's ideas in a theatrical con- text, although many biblical plays exhibited novel characteristics. An exception was Matatyahu Shoham, who composed four biblical plays between 1924 and 1937, which, because of their original style, structure, and imaginative rendering of historical events, are landmarks in the history of Hebrew theatre. Overall, plays have been written about a host of biblical characters, for various purposes and with varying degrees of dramatic success.9 This was in the face of constant controver- sy over the use of biblical material because of its inherent spirituality. Some early twentieth-century critics claimed that its presentation on the modern stage signi- fied a debasement of the sacred material.l0 There was a strong link between the development of the pre-Israel Hebrew play and the national movement. In fact, for Shoham, writing in 1927 at the time 4. See Gershon Shaked, Hamahazeh ha'ivri hahistori betekufat hatehiya. Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1970. 5. Richard Gotteheil and M.

They be- lieved that employing the Bible as a narrative source would connect the nation's ancestry with modern Hebrew culture, ensuring the emergence of a Hebrew dra- matic form appropriate to express the new nation. After the establishment of the state, Israeli playwrights continued to create a dramatic tradition that would reflect both their cultural past and their national present. Their attempt to confront the present through a study of Jewish history also revealed their need to view their society as being part of an historical process.14 According to Freddy Rokem, the Bible in its new context could serve the authors in "expressing a secular Zionist yearning for the ancient homeland based on the holy texts, rather than a religious one."15 Also, they realized that in establishing a dramatic tradition it would be necessary to provide a basis of story and legend to accord with the classical myths that constituted the source of for- eign, established dramatic canons. "[By] turning to the Bible as a source of inspi- ration and a reservoir of narrative materials, the Israeli theatre has tried to make up for its lack of an indigenous classical tradition."'6 Rokem suggests that the for- mation of a classical canon on the basis of the Bible may seem to stand in opposi- tion to the opportunity to create an avant-garde drama. 17 However, it was essential to create theatrical norms identified with Israeli/Hebrew culture rather than with popular foreign theatrical cultures. In fact, for an artistic generation that proclaimed its ideological separation from the past, the obsession with the past on the part of the post-1948 playwrights was paradoxically iconic. Perhaps this obsession was linked to a need to find a par- ticularly Israeli voice within the cultural tradition. Almost from the start, the meth- od by which the Bible was employed in Israeli drama differed from the approach of 11.

According to Ezra Sussman, the playwrights tried to remain true to the biblical narrative ... and its spirit, sought to expand what they could as convincingly as possible, to bestow dramatic form on the epic essence, to fill in the missing details, to cast some light on shaded por- tions of the picture, to add movement and colour to a plot that was sometimes enclosed in a few short sentences. And above all to interpret and bring to light, as far as possible, the submerged psychological tenor.18 As the genre expanded, even this extent of fidelity to the narratives and to their spirit weakened. Israeli playwrights freely manipulated the biblical text, construct- ing new symbolic meanings for the stories while experimenting with intertextual- ity and symbolism in their entirely modern exegesis. Israel Eliraz commented that "any secular Hebrew creative artist who is loyal to himself cannot go into the bib- lical topics (without being artificial and false) the way they are; rather he must seek himself in the historical reality described in the Bible."'19 The Israeli playwrights' methods conformed with the accepted principles of biblical-historical drama: first, that it offers a selective view of history, a "high de- gree of manipulation";20 second, that used together in the same work, fact and fic- tion tend to subvert each other, the introduction of imagination corrupting the text's factual basis,21 and third, that history plays are as much a comment on the play- wrights' own times as on the periods about which they are ostensibly written, and the more they concern themselves with politics and power, the closer their rela- tionship with reality.22 For Israeli playwrights, biblical stories and archetypes do serve as paradigms of current social and political issues but also for the purpose of argument, satire, parody, and thesis, filling the role of classical myth in modern European drama. In most of the plays, the past is evoked to interpret the national present.23 In the 1950s, the Israeli historical play still supported the prevailing dra- matic norm of realism, which provided an appropriate framework for the sociopo- litical allegories. As Gideon Ophrat points out, the majority of the authors of historical plays were also responsible for the drama of realism whose topic was al- most exclusively Israel in the 1950s.24 This realistic tendency distinguishes the his- torical play of that decade from the biblical allegory of the 1960s, a decade of greater stylistic experimentation. Historical drama blends history with an idea that forms the basis of the dra- 18. Ezra Sussman, "Hebrew drama," World Theatre, May-June, 1965. 19.

While recognizing the characters as historical people, the audience sees them in a dramatic present. Plays of this kind may remain broadly true to his- tory or to the biblical text, yet the experience they offer is often not historical or biblical in the sense that audiences believe, as they did during the Haskalah for ex- ample, that they are engaging with past figures and events. Their engagement is with the relevance of these figures for the present.25 For example, in Meged's Mil- hemet benei or (The Wars of the Sons of Light), as in many other historical plays, the ideology of the present is offered "in the clothing of the past"26 Generally, therefore, despite their biblical characters and contexts, ultimately the plays' prob- lematics are those of the present and perhaps the future, rather than those of the past. Playwrights will always remain faithful to the structure of the modern world, rather than to that of the anterior text, the religious viewpoint having given way to a secular and modern one. Because of the audience's knowledge of the Bible and its canonical nature, the playwrights' dialectic between the source and modern texts is particularly powerful, more so than with a non-canonical historical text. This leads to the question whether, for the purposes of the drama, "biblical" and "historical" are synonymous. Biblical stories are part of an ideological and moral unity expressed as a total history, whereas history plays take their narratives from a variety of disparate and unrelated historical events. Perhaps biblical events are less important in themselves than the playwright's attitude to scriptural ideol- ogy and the extent to which he or she subverts or mythologizes it. For example, in many of the Hebrew plays the absence of God is as significant as the "manipulat- ed" stories themselves. In most cases--vindicating the strictures of the religious authorities-the manipulative dramatisation of the biblical text is potentially sub- versive. The Israeli playwrights took the canonical text to be, in Frank Kermode's term, "omnisignificant,"27 one whose place in the canon requires its being subject to perpetually new hermeneutical acts. Playwrights consider the biblical text, de- spite its canonical nature, to be "open," subject not to a single interpretation but, rather, to conflicting claims to revelation and truth. They therefore use the Bible as a "received paradigm"28 with the intention of subverting it and challenging its sacred basis. In contemporary Israel this may also be a challenge to the growing power of religious factions. III The legitimate ruler drags behind him along a chain of crimes.

The wheel has turned full circle.29 The aesthetic breakthrough in Israel occurred in 1953 with Nissim Aloni's Akhzar mikol hamelekh (The King is the Cruellest), a play based on the events re- counted in I Kings 12:1; II Chron. 10:1 - I Kings 14:25; II Chron. 12:2 . Born in 1926, Aloni was, chronologically, a member of the Palmah or dor ba'aretz gener- ation, sharing their ideology. For example, he called for a war of the sons against the fathers ... the fathers taught the sons to fight a war against an external enemy for the sake of creating a new reality but they didn't teach them to fight the real war for the sake of this reality-the war against the fathers and their realized ideology.30 This statement summarized an entire system of literary representation. The clash between the European founders with their idealized visions of a future in Palestine and the culturally and politically Israelized sons, indifferent to the founding ide- ology, is almost a clich6 within Israeli cultural discourse. Yet this conflict has sup- plied Israeli literature with its most potent symbolic partnership, the father and the son, which appears in numerous guises throughout the fiction, poetry, and drama. This repeated metaphor suggests not only the primal taboo, but a taboo which the Jews in general and Israelis in particular have especially taken to heart. The presence of fathers in modern Jewish literature is too pervasive to be ignored. In contemporary Hebrew poetry, for example, the figure of the dead fa- ther haunts the son, returning to him in dreams and visions with an implied re- proach for having renounced the father's world, his traditions, and his faith, thereby killing him. This metaphor is extended in Aloni's dramas, where the guilt of patricide destroys the son as well. As Ignaz Maybaum has noted, "father and son are one, and the tragedy of the one is connected with the tragedy of the oth- er."31 Even more so, according to Yael Feldman, "Oedipus bends under the bur- den of his multiple identities. He is, according to Tiraeseas' definition, both father and brother of his sons; both son and husband of his mother; and also the son, sexual rival, and murderer."32 Some time before the publication of Freud's Moses and Monotheism, the young Hebrew writer M. Z. Feierberg seemed to have had some intuition of Freud's ideas in his indictment of his apostate hero, Nahman, for "murdering everything inside him: himself, his father, his father's fathers, his entire people."33 This was Feierberg's apocalyptic vision of the outcome of the Haskalah, the usurpation of tradition by modernity, the father by the son. Modernity itself has created this most 29. Jan Kott, Shakespeare Our Contemporary. London: Methuen, 1965, p. 6. 30. See Michael Gurewitz, Hayyim Shoham, Sh.

The split between the traditional demands on modem Jews and their assumption of modern "civility" is vast and unresolved. In the oedipal conflict be- tween God and the Jews, tradition has been routed by modernity, with the conse- quent guilt shaping the deep structure of secular Jewish writing. Nissim Aloni's greatest achievement, which has been adopted and extended by many younger playwrights, is his rendering of this deep structure through the figure of a king either on the point of losing power or vainly aspiring to regain it. In this figure, Aloni has established a metaphor to examine an element of the Is- raeli unconscious strongly related to the oedipal conflict. Kings in his plays are fa- thers and rulers destroyed or displaced by sons. Moreover the king/father is either old and weak, or else brutal, providing a reason, real or imagined, for the son's usurpation. Often the sons perpetuate the cycle of incompetence and violence, and have to be replaced. Aloni's deviation from the Israeli dramatic norm of realism rests largely on this scheme of often-murderous filial rebellion. In other Israeli plays on the topic the king indirectly or directly kills his son, introducing the sym- bolism of the Akedah, the converse of the oedipal theme. I have selected four plays based on biblical narratives to serve as paradigms of works that examine the nature of the father/king and his effect on the society he rules. It is interesting that the drama of a modern democracy should choose a king- dom as the archetype of the polity; it is also natural for an Israeli writer to explore the nature of power and authority in a setting of historical Jewish autonomy, de- spite the kings being neither strong nor admirable. Nonetheless, the plays refer to these periods of political autonomy as the forerunners of the modern independent state. The biblical conception of the monarchy was closely related to the idea of monarchy throughout the ancient Near East.34 However, while their king was anointed as the Lord's chosen, the Israelites did not regard him as divine. In fact, the stories about King Saul make it clear that a monarchy was regarded as contra- dictory to the idea of the direct rule of God over his people.35 As the one anoint- ed by God to lead his people, the king's power was no more than the embodiment of God's will and, like the people, the king had a duty to obey the divine law. The major difference between Shakespearean and biblical histories reflects the soci- eties' cultural differences: According to Shakespeare, the king owes a duty and re- sponsibility to the people but in the Bible the king owes a duty and a responsibility only to God. However, many of the modern Israeli biblical plays exclude mention of God, and his representatives, when they appear, are portrayed negatively. In this respect, therefore, the ideological scheme of these plays is rather more Shake- spearean than biblical. The first of my choice of plays is Aloni's The King is the Cruellest, his only history. For many other writers of Aloni's generation, the national renewal in Is- rael signified a certain liberation from history. However, in this play, through the conflict between King Rehoboam, son of King Solomon, and Jeroboam, Aloni both examines events in the biblical period as the source of modern Israel's prob- 34. See I Samuel 8. 35. See, Jud. 8:22-23; I Sam. 8:7. 70</page><page sequence="9">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage lems and uses the biblical history as a political paradigm. The King is the Cruellest combines in one work the diverse structures of historical drama while retaining all the conventions of the biblical genre. It is a history; a mythical play in its depic- tion of the rebellion of a subject against the king; and an allegory of a period in the political history of modern Israel. The exploration of the ideal of monarchy and the reality of kingship is the underlying theme of the play; good and evil in the pri- vate and public realms.36 Aloni selected biblical events that had some parallel with the political system in Israel of his time. In fact, his allusions to realpolitik were not missed by the critics of the period: For example, the rightist paper Herut at- tacked the apparent censure of Israel in the play; the extreme left-wing press crit- icized the play's implied attitude to Russia.37 In The King is the Cruellest, Jeroboam is exiled to Egypt for ten years after incurring the king's suspicion of his role as leader of the popular democratic par- ties. He is then recalled by the northern tribes on the refusal of Rehoboam, "the cruellest of all," to accept the constitutional terms offered to him at his accession. Rebellion, led by Jeroboam, is inevitable, the result being the division of the na- tion into the independent kingdoms of Judah and Israel, with Jeroboam the king of Israel. In this biblical framework Aloni built a drama of ideas concerning revo- lution, democratic idealism, the ruler's corruption, the opportunism of political ad- visers, and the hypocrisy of religious fanaticism. The play examines the interrelationships of the major biblical dramatis per- sonae, at the centre of which is Jeroboam, an entirely modern hero although, like Hamlet, he is unable to make up his mind. As an idealistic leader of a rebellion against the king, he hesitates, fearing the ultimate corruption of power. In the end he leads the mutiny for motives that are never entirely clarified in the play: either his Volumnia-like mother's ambition, his love for Rehoboam's queen, Maakah, po- litical conviction or expediency, or all of these. He is accused by a courtier of hav- ing involved the nation in his personal battle, that is, his desire for the king's wife. Towards the end of the play Jeroboam has become indistinguishable from the hat- ed king. Once having envisaged the displacement of Rehoboam, his private moral judgement gives way to the public menace. He fills the archetypal role of a young prince threatening the king, justifying his actions with political rhetoric, obliged to compromise his own ethical judgment in order to achieve his ambiguous pur- pose as savior of his people. Rehoboam sees through his ideological posturing, ac- curately assessing that "half of him follows the yelling of the populace and the other half the charms of the palace." Jeroboam detests war and bloodshed, but re- solves to fight the king because of his own apparently idealistic view of govern- ment: Shammai: Who gave you the right to kill platoons of flesh and blood without batting an eyelid? To send your mother to the hangman with a qui- et heart. Jeroboam: Do you recognize the face of war, Shammai? The commander gives orders, the archers let their arrows fly and the horsemen gal- 36.

Only the sword and the shield and the lance have their say. The sounds of the heart have flickered and died. Shammai: Suddenly you speak with a different voice.... Zeruah [Jeroboam's mother]: I didn't believe those who say that you are an Egyptian. But the mockery in your voice is like the mockery in the voice of Rehoboam the king. Shammai: Is this man better than Rehoboam? Rehoboam also mocks the na- tion, but there is no mask on his face. Towards the end of the play, Jeroboam has a long speech that appears to be Aloni's comment on Israel's policy in the 1950s. To forestall isolation, says Jer- oboam, a small, poor nation must make alliances with the neighbor states. Israel's political and national fate-then as today-is Israel's geographical position and its relationship with the surrounding nations. He rejects Israel's spiritual exclu- sivism, and states his suspicion of the political opportunism implied in prophecy. In his opposition to religious extremism, Jeroboam calls for a national existence detached from religion. The spiritual authority in the play, Ahiah the Shilonite, fears-with justification-that Jeroboam's attitude will threaten the religious and ethnic particularity of the chosen nation. In the following oratory Jeroboam re- nounces play's own context and speaks directly to the Israeli audience: If the man who closes his eyes in order not to see the surrounding countries is a Hebrew, I am an Egyptian because I see the peace of Jerusalem in Damas- cus ... If Ahiah the Shilonite who cries out that we must exist alone is a He- brew-I, Jeroboam, am an Egyptian because I seek to find allies in other lands, from the Euphrates to the Nile ... Am I an Egyptian because I tell you to seek Damascus and Hamat, that our horses should be theirs and our war theirs? The King is the Cruellest was extraordinarily perceptive, as if Aloni could see, even in the comparative political stability of the early years, that in Israel's eth- no-nationalism lay the seeds of the catastrophes of the future. Jeroboam even cas- tigates his people for their nationalistic hubris, presaging a central topic in post-1967 Hebrew drama. Ultimately, Jeroboam does not kill the king, only the ideal of kingship in himself. Another ofAloni's themes is that of fruitless aspiration, grandiose plans that come to nothing. In The King is the Cruellest he revealed the disappointment of a generation that had discovered that realizing its social and political ideals was something of a poisoned chalice. The dream of an independent polity, which harked back to the great kingdoms of David and Solomon, was soured by the con- frontation with the values of the modem state. In this sense Aloni had much in common with the other writers of his and later generations: Through the dramatic portraits of the kings we see the distortion of the ideals, the fall from the idealized monarchy to a Machiavellian conception of kingship. In the play, Jeroboam's ide- alism affects his understanding of the realities of political life, embodied in the self-serving pragmatism not only of the king, but of Zeruah and Maakah and oth- er diverse representatives of the life of the state. 72</page><page sequence="11">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage The play follows the tragic structure of three acts, with a prologue and two intermediate scenes.

While it was not a box office success at the time, it has been revived four times in altered political circumstances.38 Aloni's modernist style and his anti-heroic archetypes empha- sized the stylistic bankruptcy of the drama of his contemporaries, who had hoped to establish viable language of realism, but managed only the most stereotypical affectations. From the time of its first performance to its first successful revival in 1974, critics debated its nature as a tragedy in the hope, perhaps, that Hebrew dra- ma could recreate classical tragedy on a Judaic foundation. On the other hand, Gideon Ophrat describes this play as conforming with the Theatre of the Absurd and compares the character of Jeroboam with Camus's Sisyphus: Jeroboam is iso- lated, he is unable to answer fundamental existential questions or to escape his fate, and he becomes aware of humanity's uselessness and the darkness of its exis- tence.39 Aloni was influenced by Brecht, Ionesco, and Alfred Jarry, among others, having spent many of his formative years in France. His Rehoboam, a typical Aloni creation, is a weak, absurd king on the point of losing his power to a younger, more virile figure. IV The kings Rehoboam and Jehu (II Kings 9-10) are notorious in history for their self-regarding despotism. The contemporary background of Gid'on Evron's violent Jehu (1992) is the period following the Lebanon war in 1982. Menahem Begin was Prime Minster and Ariel Sharon his Chief-of-Staff. After the massacres at Sabra and Shatila, Begin suffered a severe depression from which he did not emerge. Through the relationship between the king and an older member of his court, Jehu demonstrates the means by which moral leadership is compromised. Unfortunately the production of this play did not serve the text. In the di- rector's attempt to create an Israeli Jacobean tragedy, the gratuitous violence on the stage, described as an "aesthetic ritual of violence"40 entirely overshadowed Evron's text. The play retains the bare outline of the biblical story with some vari- ations for dramatic consistency or effect. The biblical Jehu, King Jehoram's com- mander in chief, was himself anointed king by an emissary of the prophet Elisha.41 In the play, he is a soldier who is taken in hand by the ruler of Samaria, Ziph, a fic- titious character, who instructs him in the courtliness he must employ in his appeal to the king for clemency after he (Jehu) has unlawfully killed a number of villagers. Eventually, Jehu murders Jehoram and seizes the throne and the queen. The play takes Jeroboam's apprehension a stage further, illustrating the ab- solute corruption of stolen power. When Azgad, a military commander in Jehu's army, attempts to raise a rebellion against the new king and asks for Ziph's sup- port, Ziph procrastinates, using many excuses. His refusal forestalls the rebellion, 38. See Rokem, op. cit., p. 317. 39. Ophrat op. cit., p. 54. 40. Michael Handelsaltz, "Efoh hamenia?" Haaretz 15-6-92. 41.

Eventually, having signed the king's order permitting the murder of seventy members of the House of Ahab and thereby becoming an accomplice in the consolidation of the new government, Ziph loses his mind. Jehu claims that murder was necessary to bring peace to the mountains; Ziph claims obedience to the king's order when he seals the murder of Ahab's house- hold. The entire play is dark and ominous with many rapidly-changing scenes; the action takes place in a central lighted area with darkness all around. A chorus of two cynical soldiers represents the army. For once, the king does not fill the role of father, but of son, yet, within the classical pattern, he has killed the king and usurped the throne. Ziph's failure to support Azgad is a result of moral relativism and later, af- ter having agreed to the mass murder of Ahab's relatives, he uses the empty justi- fication of obedience to orders. "What is there to explain? The king commanded and I obeyed. I'm just a soldier, sir." The oblique allusion to Eichmann's notorious defence places the play firmly within Israel's contemporary political debate. More- over, Jehu strays further from its roots than The King is the Cruellest by failing to include any representative of religion at all. Ziph, the voice of civil authority, is the king's adviser and mentor, and he fills the role of father. All the characters are fa- miliar ones from the modern secular world: army commanders, soldiers, and high- ranking officials. The play compares types of moral compromise, weakness and brutality be- ing equally deadly to the nation, and, like The King is the Cruellest, it demonstrates the dishonesty of politics. At the beginning of the play, Jehu is something of an in- nocent savage whom Ziph trains. As king, Jehu has few qualms about his own lack of morality but questions the dishonesty of the court, represented by Ziph. More significantly in the context of the 1990s, the play claims that the person who obeys the command is as culpable as the person who has given it. As Jehu tells him dur- ing their confrontation, Ziph could have refused to sign the order. Towards the end of the play Jehu, who has become as importunate as an abandoned child, attempts to cajole Ziph, now suffering from aphasia and mental breakdown, to recognize and communicate with him. Jehu:You'll still be a king, in my view, Ziph! ... The two of us will tell stories about Samaria and Yizrael. The biographers will distort everything, shame- lessly, as usual ... but we need the truth, don't we? It's strange, Ziph, how in order to understand what we did, we need to tell the story from the beginning, an artist who paints a child in his father's arms and suddenly we discover what a father's love is ... It is as if Jehu seeks a father who constitutes a part of his past of innocence and perhaps decency. He wants the return of the moral order that he had once consid- ered Ziph to represent, indicated by his frantic attempt to restore Ziph to sanity and memory. But the world's moral laws have ceased to exist, and the father has for- gotten the truth. The dominance of father and son, king and subject, shift and al- ternate in this play. Each has both created and destroyed the other. 74</page><page sequence="13">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage V This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath the power but as it is suffer'd. (King Lear, Act I, scene ii) The question is whether these plays about biblical kings form a genre of political acts. Aloni's play finds its society politically misguided. Jehu dramatizes its author's ideological convictions. Yaakov Shabtai's early play, Keter barosh (A Crowned Head, 1970), while a parody, is less superficial than the others whose political purpose is explicit. However, even when plays about biblical kings are not overtly political, they will relate in some way to the polity. If there were no value-neutral discourses at all,42 in Israel of the 1960s and 1970s the value was almost exclusively political. In A Crowned Head, a play that uses anachronism as a comic device, the po- litical focus is that of the royal succession. King David is seen at the end of his life, fussy, childish, and forgetful. According to Gidon Ophrat, Shabtai sees David as a kind of Pantaloon. "He is not a person with thimble-sized desires. He is a loving, human, complex man, filled with appetite. Everything about him is 'extra large,' [sic] like a real king. Much love, hate, ambition, regret, life and humanity."43 With his family and courtiers increasingly impatient and disrespectful, the crown, usu- ally hanging from a corner of the throne, provides the king with the only remain- ing proof of his power. He could be an Aloni monarch, clownishly clinging to his throne while all around his advisers are plotting his "retirement." David has two potential heirs: Adonijah, a feckless youth whom he blindly loves, and Solomon, boring and bookish, who is Bathsheba's favorite. Meanwhile, David's throne is physically being cut down, its legs shortened on his command, a symbol, also, of the king's diminishing life. The action of the play takes place in his bedroom, with an enormous four-poster as bed its centerpiece. King Lear gave his kingdom away; David has reduced his to his bed and his throne. In Ionesco's Le Roi se Meurt, also set in the old king's bedroom, a crack on the wall grows as the king's life span shrinks. In both plays the comic distortions are due to their serious content which would be less easy for audiences to accept if they were structured realistically. The faintly absurd style allows the difficult truths of life and death, love and succes- sion, to be communicated in a bearable way. Shabtai follows closely the outlines of the biblical story and even retains some of the biblical protagonists' characteristics. Yet, however much this may seem to be a reinterpretation of the story, it remains a highly personal musing on aging and impotence by a writer still in his thirties. Shabtai's early death gives his pre- occupation with old age an added poignancy: David: Nothing comes back. That's the way it is. Everything goes ... And every day is worse ... A hole. An abyss filled with shadows. That's all that's 42. See Linda Hutcheon, A Poetics of Postmodernism-History, Theory, Fiction, New York and London: Routledge, 1988. 43. Moznayim, 49, 4 (October, 1985), p. 50. 75</page><page sequence="14">Glenda Abramson left: shadows. Jonathan. Amnon. Abigail. Abner ... One summer's day ... Something Michal said ... A Crowned Head provides an almost unique character study in the Hebrew drama of its time. King David is a Lear without the tragic nobility, only the petu- lance born of frustration and destroyed expectations. He is alternately strong and forceful, weak and wheedling; a beleaguered king, fighting for his throne and his life-because he is old-against the plotters, schemers, nags, and traitors. Shab- tai's lightness of tone does not conceal the king's agony as he pretends to please everyone. Ultimately, because of his ideal of kingship, the isolated king holds his own against them all, in implicit conformity with both the biblical idea of respon- sibility to the divine command and the Shakespearean idea of service to the na- tion. David is concerned only about finding a worthy successor for his beloved kingdom. In one scene, Adonijah visits his father to ask for money for some friv- olous purchase. The king, like Lear, a foolish, fond old man, accedes to his whims but stops short of agreeing to name him his heir. Through Shabtai's skillful char- acterization, we see David's power and toughness through the silliness of his old age in some moments of high pathos. In the end, he solves the problem by quick thinking and action, confirming his undiminished power of leadership. If the play has any political message at all-which is not clear-it is that the power of one day may be gone the next. There is little discernible reference to con- temporary Israel unless it is in the king's utopian vision of peace: We are one nation in the land. One kingdom, one city, one king. We don't need autonomies, creeds or tribalism. We need forests of cypress and pine and tamarisks on the mountain and in the desert ... We need to raise our birthrate. Three sons to every family ... six... ten, strong, sunburnt, agile, literate. We need justice and righteousness between man and wife, kin and stranger, citi- zen and foreigner. .. and poets who will rule us, and through the power of their verse they will make us into a holy people, a chosen nation. The High Priest Evyatar's depiction of reality is somewhat different. In his attempt to persuade Joab to rebel against David he says: "There is no David. It is finished. There is no king in Israel. The kingdom is disintegrating like an old coat." It is dif- ficult to presume that these words have no significance at all in Israel soon after 1967. Yet these thoughts are not developed other than within the context of a plot against David. Although A Crowned Head has tragic potential, comic dialogue and action paradoxically increase the poignancy of the king's position. Overall, it has a strong- ly Shakespearean tenor. First, there are clear allusions, both textual and situation- al, to King Lear and Julius Caesar, the glimmerings of the tragedy of Lear in David's isolation and impotent fury. Second, there are two "mechanicals," comical farmers who interrupt the action and provide relief for the audience. Third, A Crowned Head is a history only in its source material, which serves as a frame- work for a drama of character. It does not reinterpret the biblical tale or alter its temporality. The play's exact chronology is unimportant since it is not a history 76</page><page sequence="15">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage play according to the definitions. It is as much about the biblical King David as Lear is about the historical Celtic king. King Lear speaks to Shakespeare's world; A Crowned Head similarly addresses our time. More significantly, the play follows the same mythic pattern as Aloni's and Evron's of a king, and therefore the king- dom, being threatened by a younger aspirant; a father by a son. At one point, com- ing upon Adonijah sitting on the throne, David says, "It's tempting, isn't it .. ." Elsewhere he comments, "Today he deploys armies behind my back and tomorrow he will rule my kingdom." The fact that the historical Adonijah did in fact take David's concubine after his death is hinted at in the play, exemplifying the oedipal subtext that links the four plays. Shabtai would go on to write more accomplished fiction in which the father-son relationship was central to his evaluation of the aftermath of Zionist ideology. Israel Eliraz's Hadov (The Bear, 1968) is a more serious examination of the relationship between King David and his sons. Eliraz is a fifth-generation Jerusa- lemite poet and librettist, and author of a nonpolitical, nonrealist biblical drama, Shalosh nashim batzahov, which is set in the days of Moses. The Bear tells of King David, here again grown old and disillusioned, who despises the panoply of king- ship and yearns for the fields and sunshine of his youth. Of the four Hebrew plays, The Bear most explicitly outlines the relationship between father and sons. The play centralizes two themes: filial rebellion-including the planned murder of the king-and the textuality of the events. As in Shabtai's A Crowned Head, in The Bear David is old, tired, and willing to relinquish his throne, yet history and God de- mand that he ensure its survival for Solomon. Absalom and Adonijah plan the re- bellion, and David pleads for Absalom's life, closely following the biblical text. In fact, the play opens with Jehoshaphat, the king's young secretary, and Shavsha, his scribe, devising the history of David and Absalom. The inevitability of rebellion is heralded by Shavsha's words: "Rebellion! ... Absalom's rebellion! ... Could one expect anything else from any self-respecting king's son?" Throughout the play, Shavsha reinforces the power of historiography over history. Only what is written will be remembered, the human motivation behind the text being, in his word, "in- significant." In both A Crowned Head and The Bear, the scribe writes according to the king's dictation, the historical record being manipulated by the king while his true story remains unknown. These plays therefore force the audience to acknowledge the inevitable textuality of the past.44 What is written down both precedes and tran- scends what is being lived; the words, not the deeds, matter; the stories about the battles are not the battles themselves. "History already knows everything," says Shavsha, quoting texts from the Bible about events that are yet to happen. In the biblical world, events are predetermined, and human action is powerless to change them. Absalom makes a wry comment: "Everything we do is unimportant-no- body will ever know this-we're alive! ... And what will they say about us? 'And Absalom died'." Like A Crowned Head, The Bear is a political play inasmuch as it is about the succession to the throne. However, there is a sense in which it also related to 44. Hutcheon, op.cit. p. 127. 77</page><page sequence="16">Glenda Abramson modem Israel. The very determinism that prevented even God's anointed from changing an immoral outcome-the killing of Absalom by David's trusted gener- al-to a moral one, is perhaps still determining the fate of Israel in our time. In the totalizing continuity of Jewish history, Israel is powerless to change the progress of events. In the play, Shavsha expresses cynically the ultimate result of the surrender to history: "You have no idea to what extent a story (parasha) un- thinkable in our time becomes an unshakeable truth after two thousand years." This is perhaps the only overtly political comment in the play. After Absalom's death, Shavsha reads out the immortal lament and David re- sponds with surprise: "Is that all?" he asks. It is not the oration of a king-only a few words of human pain, and as David utters them he is able to express his own grief. Both King David plays highlight the conflict between the king's humanity and the demands of his position and of the state. Joab, representing the military, admonishes David about mourning for the soldiers he has sent out to die. "You can't mourn. Your pain lacks significance. You have won!" This may be a veiled political statement: The needs of state transcend the king's-and the people's- pain. There is an element of triumphalism in this play that David detests, arguing against the common view that victory is the only aim in a war. Hanokh Levin's satirical play, The Queen of the Bathtub (1970) highlights the hubristic atmosphere of post-1967 Israel. As with Evyatar's comment in The Crowned Head, it is diffi- cult not to relate similar elements in The Bear to the situation in Israel after 1967. The Akedah is more explicitly alluded to in this play than in any of the oth- ers. In spite of his love for his rebellious son, David is obliged to go to war against him in order to carry out God's command: I have promised the kingdom to another ... I had to go against myself. I promised that you would not continue to rule my way ... [God] has to carry out my promise. He wanted it. He demanded it. Tomorrow I'll fight so that an- other way can triumph. This is how I accept the judgment. The "other way" is presumably that of Solomon: "The nation no longer needs a conquering king, but one who inherits-a man of rest, who hates blood, a king whose every way will be different from mine.. ." In this sense, God is testing David as he tested Abraham. Not only is David put to the test, however, and not only through David is the Akedah recalled: Joab, Absalom's killer, has been as much a father to Absalom as has the king. Yet when David insists on saving Absalom, Joab tells him that he is not only making a mistake, but committing a sin: "There are things that are impossible to do. No man can do them." David responds, "I'm com- manding you to do something that can't be commanded, and I'm doing it because I am a king. Absalom must live." Nonetheless, on the king's command, Absalom does not live. Before the battle David tells him, "You will die. God has chosen an- other king-not you." On the other hand, Adonijah says to Absalom: "What is left to us to do other than rebel against our old father? He expects it of us," and Absa- lom tells his father's concubine, "Children have been created only to say 'no.'" War and kingship are indivisible, war linking the past and the present. War is the inevitable corollary of leadership, and a rite of passage for an aspirant king. 78</page><page sequence="17">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage But an unsanctioned war, such as a rebellion, is a war against God. Absalom is aware of the struggle against God's will and the mythic tussle between father/king and usurper/son: "Only a revolution against you will bring me to the crown. As a king's son, I'm obliged to revolt. As a rebel, I'm obliged to die." Since the king de- rives his authority from God, to challenge him is to challenge the divinely-ordained system of political life. Absalom may not understand David's reasons for going to war against him, but he does understand this: "You cannot rebel against the king without rebelling against God," he says. "Those who follow me follow me in sin- rebelling against God-against their king whom they loved until yesterday." He, too, well understands his place and his father's in the deterministic scheme of their history. One of Absalom's crimes is to have gone up to his father's concubine, a fur- ther oedipal element of this text, as indeed of the biblical text. Naturally, it is far more explicit in the play: Absalom accuses the young woman of having lost her beauty and become old; he calls her an "old little girl" and almost strangles her be- cause he imagines her exuding an odor like his mother's. The choice of King David as a royal protagonist is paradoxical, following paradoxes that characterized his own life. David was a great warrior and leader, but he was a shepherd and a poet and, in the plays, he hankers for the simple life of his youth. Israel's greatest king was a flawed human being: pious but immoral. Although he united his kingdom, there was never peace during his reign. He had a number of troublesome wives and many sons, none of whom brought him any fatherly satisfaction, some of them dedicated to killing him. David is, therefore, the perfect paradigm of a modem man. VI The sun does not circle round the earth, there is no order of the spheres, or of nature. The king is no Lord's anointed, and politics is only an art aiming at cap- turing and securing power ... The order of history and the order of nature are both cruel; terrifying are the passions that breed in the human heart.45 In all these plays, the king's private realm is exclusively that of the family, with the weakness of the patriarch in the private sphere signifying chaos in the pub- lic sphere. The David plays have no political context other than the rivalry between the father and his sons. It is possible that family and state serve as analogies of each other, but it is more likely-with more than a hint of the Shakespearean hierar- chical pattern-that all these biblical plays see the disintegration of the family as foreshadowing that of the state. According to John Danby, in relation to the Shake- spearean histories, "the ordered nature of the individual cannot be fulfilled except in a properly ordered state. Disorder in the state will incur a disorder in man. The parallelism is felt as more than analogy."46 The women in these plays, the wives and daughters, are irrelevant, and sub- ordinate to the men whose fate determines theirs, and they serve both as symbols 45. Kott, op.cit, p. 40. 46. Danby, op.cit., p. 171-172. 79</page><page sequence="18">Glenda Abramson of powerlessness and as the markers of moral norms. Shabtai's Bathsheba gets her way only because her ambition for her son coincides with the divine will. In the other plays, the women, however powerful and manipulative-as both Zeruah and Maakah are in The King is the Cruellest-are disdained, insulted, and destroyed by the kings. Zeruah is a woman of zealous inconsistencies, who foments the re- bellion through her need to avenge her husband, killed in the service of Solomon, Rehoboam's father. Yet her political and religious fanaticism is a cover for essen- tially dynastic aspirations. Ultimately, Jeroboam allows her to be executed because of his own idealistic political convictions, or perhaps because Zeruah fails to be convinced by them. In his dishonouring of Jehoram's widow, Zilpah, Jehu reaches a point of moral degradation similar to Richard III's in his humiliation of Lady Anne, whose husband Richard has killed:47 In Richard III: Gloucester: Let him thank me, that holp to send him there; For he was fitter for that place than Earth. Lady Anne: And thou unfit for any place but hell. Gloucester: Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it. Lady Anne: Some dungeon. Gloucester: Your bed-chamber. In Jehu: Jehu: I like resistance, Madam. You arouse me. I wanted your brain, your status, but I was wrong. The connection between us can be deeper. Zilpah: Bastard. Jehu: What can I do. That mouth and those breasts tell us a story. Zilpah: Go to the prostitutes. Jehu: Ah. Why do you reduce my desire and yours to the level of the simple crowd? Zilpah: My desire? You're mad. Like Lady Anne, Zilpah recognizes the final annihilation of the moral order. Jehu reduces the family and the world to the elemental forces of hate and lust,48 from which all the women know there is no escape. The flaws in the king therefore pose an equal danger to society and family, for these plays function on the dual levels of family and state despite the instances in Shabtai's play, where David makes a clear distinction between the two: "Father and king-they don't go together," he says. David insists that personal feeling should not affect matters of state: "[to Bathsheba] You're a mother. But I'm a king. There's a difference." David responds to Adonijah: "Don't start with your 'Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,' not while I'm working [puts the crown on his head]." The plays make the point that the public (political) response to private concerns is irrespon- 47. William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Richard III, Act I, scene ii. 48. See Jan Kott, Shakespeare Our Contemporary. London: Methuen and Co., 1978, p. 37. 80</page><page sequence="19">Israeli Drama and the Bible: Kings on the Stage sible and that the two should be distinct. King Jehu demonstrates a clear sense of this when the former queen Zilpah pleads with him to allow her to bury her hus- band Jehoram's body: Zilpah: .... Even if his death was deserved, he was a good man. Let me bury him. Jehu: Good? Good?! An entire army is decomposing on Ramot Hagilad, slaughtered because of the good king, the king who wanted these bare mountains, these miserable villages so that he could laugh with satis- faction: this is mine. Mine ... This is the man you want to cry for? Even if none of these kings explicitly highlights a contemporary problem of Middle Eastern realpolitik, by using the Bible as the source of their inspiration and, perhaps, as specular warnings to modern Israel, the four playwrights have made a tacit assumption of political continuity, in itself a political statement. This accords, to a certain extent, with Shaked's evaluation: The modem generation sees itself connected to the values of the past. It seems that here [in the biblical play] the historical situation of the modem Jewish generation is given expression. This generation, striving for national libera- tion, wants to perpetuate the connection between itself and those same Juda- ic values which were created in the period of national liberty in the past.49 On the other hand, three of these biblical plays are devoid of God, which in itself proposes their central dilemma. Their political subtexts are divorced from mysticism or theology, God's absence from them indicating from the start a changed order in state and society. The Mystery of State-the notion that royal de- ception, or mystery, is a divinely-sanctioned activity and a requirement for rule- is entirely absent. God's representatives are equally human and fallible. In The King is the Cruellest, the prophet Ahiah the Shilonite is corrupt, seeking only to further his own political ambition of theocratic power. The biblical Jehu acted un- der the clear guidance of God, who anointed him in order to destroy the Baal cult. In Evron's play the action is entirely motivated by men. In A Crowned Head Nathan the prophet is an inconsequential, anxious, and neurotic old man and Evyatar, the High Priest, is the leading plotter against David. Shabtai makes fun of them both. When Nathan, becoming very impatient with the rambling king, exclaims in ex- asperation, "God in heaven ... ," David angrily responds: "Leave God out of it, leave him alone," an ambiguous comment either in protection or rejection of God. Even in The Bear, which preserves the divine imperative, God's command is cruel: to save the nation, a son must be sacrificed. The Bible is further voided of its sa- credness by a form of intertextuality that uses the biblical text as a joke, a means of despiritualization. It is no more than a "textual echo,"50 its power subverted through irony and often, sheer comedy. In one sense this may justify the fears of 49.

The kings symbolize not only particular problems of government and lead- ership. The fact that these figures are chosen over any modern political symbols is indicative of the relationship between Israel and God, which is tacitly at the center of all these plays. Modem Hebrew drama recasts the biblical stories as a kind of mythology to interpret the political culture of modern Israel and, crucially, to chart the course of fundamental religio-cultural change. Great uncertainty follows this cultural breakdown, that is, the loss of traditional absolutes, embodied by Feier- berg in the act of parricide, itself a metaphor for the killing of God. The biblical plays describe the disintegration of the polity within a spiritual and moral vacuum, with the king-who once represented God-now representing the secular state. The unresolvable relationship between father and son and the relinquishing of God are the plays' metaphors for loss, insecurity, and potential change in the modern world. Because they do not go so far as to see the result of the change in a stable monarchy, they do not offer a solution other than the pessimistic suggestion that those who usurp the throne generally perpetuate its instability and that the wheel is likely to come full circle. For these plays, the Solomonic kingdom is still far off. Glenda Abramson University of Oxford Oxford, U.K. 51. See Shaked, "Hasikui vehasikun." p. 127. 82</page></plain_text>
