<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 285 Yehuda Nini and Maya Fruchtman, eds. Rabbi Shem Tob Ben Izhak Ardutiel or Don Santo De-Carrion, "Ma'ase-Harab" (The Debate between the Pen and the Scissors). Tel Aviv: Tel-Aviv University Press, 1980, 86 pp. In recent years there has been an increased interest by scholars in Spain (E. Alarcos Llorach, A. Castro, F. Diaz Esteban, A. Gerchunoff, I. Llubera Gonz~les, C. Sinchez-Albornos), France (J. Joset), Israel (H. Schirmann), Argentina (E. Lanuza Gonzales), and the United States (C. A. Colahan, J. Kleinerman) in the life and works of the fourteenth-century Castilian rabbi Shem Tob ben Isaac Ardutiel, following the discovery by Y. Baer in 1935 that Ardutiel was identical with Santob de Carri6n, author of the celebrated Proverbios morales. Ardutiel has been variously praised for his writings on man's behavior and his insights into the dynamics of personality and human emotions (A. Castro); for his intellectual bent and his detached observations of life and society (Sanchez-Albornos); and for his criticism of human pretensions to know absolute truth (A. Colahan). In addition to the Proverbios morales written in Castilian using Hebrew characters, his literary legacy includes a vidui for the musaf service on the Day of Atonement; a baqasha of 2,000 words each beginning with the letter mem, patterned after the Baqashat ha-Memim of Yedaya ha-Penini and the somewhat later Malkiel of Menalhem ben Elia of Kastoria; a translation from Arabic into Hebrew of a liturgical work by Israel ha-Israeli which he entitled MiSvot Zemanniyyot; and a maqama called Milhbemet ha-Et ve-ha- Misparayim, an amusing debate on the relative merits of pen and scissors as instruments for writing, composed in 1345. The latter work, which was published in Metz in 1859 by Eliezer Ashkenazi, using two defective manuscripts, has been reissued by Tel-Aviv University under the capable editorship of Yehuda Nini and Maya Frucht- man, based on a photocopy of the more accurate version that was once the proud possession of the Juedisch-Theologisches Seminar in Breslau (cf. MS Saraval, no. 38, Stein Catalogue, p. 120). In his "debate" between pen and scissors, Ardutiel parodies the more serious debate between the pen and the sword (i.e., between the religious and secular authorities or between the bureaucratic administrator and the military commander in the field), a well-known contemporary theme in Hebrew and Arabic literature. Following a brief introduction of alternating rhymed prose and verse, and after stating his intention to write with his scissors, the author gives us the details of a quarrel with his pen for failing him on a particularly cold winter day by refusing to penetrate a frozen inkwell. (The literary debate between master and possession was a familiar</page><page sequence="2">286 BOOK REVIEWS parody of the period employed by such Provenqal and Catalin writers as Bertran Carbonell, Gui de Cavaillo, and Anselmo Turmeda.) The first principal narrative division of the work ends with the inversion of imagery common to this genre, as the author's earlier joy at the prospect of entertaining himself with his noble and faithful writing pen on this cold and friendless day turns into anger and abuse of this "ungrateful" and "splintered reed." In the second section pen and scissors argue their respec- tive merits. The author is persuaded by the scissors and is delighted to find an able alternative to his fickle pen. The handsome letters formed by the scissors now become an ornament for the concepts they express (lines 276-280), as the author heaps praise upon his new writing tool in a reprise of metaphors earlier reserved for his pen. In rebuttal the pen charges that the scissors are not suited for writing-the author's ingenuity in this instance notwithstanding-and proposes that an impartial judge, a man in the street, be asked to determine the proper use of each object. The pen is vindicated when the "judge," after sorting through the author's household utensils, begins to write with the pen, and then trims his beard and nails with the scissors (lines 515-519). The pen celebrates its victory by again writing for its master and, in a continuing inversion of images, is praised for pur- suing its traditional calling, with an implied rebuke to the scissors for their attempt to pervert the established order of creation. In the third and con- cluding section, Ardutiel praises God for his compassion in a time of dis- tress and condemns the schemers and plotters who, like a cutting scissor, bring divisiveness and fear into the city, even as he admits to writing this entire work without the benefit of pen and ink (i.e., with his scissors)! Nini and Fruchtman's edition of Ardutiel's "Debate" comes complete with a thorough critical apparatus and a valuable excursus on Ardutiel's use of biblical, rabbinic, and Arabic literary sources and on the distinctive vocalization of his text. The editors are to be commended for rejecting as mere speculation the thesis that Ardutiel's "Debate" is a political allegory reflecting the distress of Castilian Jewry in 1336-1340 under Alfonso XI, following the rise to power of his major-domo, Gonzalo Martinez de Oviedo. Regrettably, the relationship of Ardutiel's "Debate" to the contem- porary debate literature in Spain is not adequately addressed by Nini and Fruchtman. To what extent was Ardutiel influenced by the debates in Judah al-Harizi's Tabkemoni or in the maqamat of the thirteenth-century Jacob b. Eliezer of Toledo? Is Ardutiel's "Debate" modeled after the medieval Latin altercatio, which seeks to establish the truth of one side of the argument, or is it more akin to the mundzara, whose general purpose was to combine or</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 287 harmonize opposing views? How is Ardutiel's work related to the contem- porary debates in Provenqal court gatherings, as, for example, the tenso and the partimen orjoc partit, particularly since Provencal literature was popular at the Castilian court during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries? Perhaps in the revised edition promised by the editors these issues will be considered. Leon J. Weinberger University of Alabama University, Ala.</page></plain_text>
