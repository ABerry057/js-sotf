<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allan Arkush. Moses Mendelssohn and the Enlightenment. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994. 304. In his introduction to Interpreting Maimonides, Marvin Fox shows how "representative Jews" have the power to beget conflicting interpretations of their works. Canonical figures are "claimed" by subsequent readers as emblematic of their own conceptions of the tradition and its relation to extra- traditional knowledge. Surely, the philosophic stature and communal authority that accrued to Maimonides cannot be said to have been attributed to Moses Mendelssohn. Nonetheless, it would appear that Mendelssohn was enough of a "representative Jew" to have spawned a range of interpretations structurally comparable to some well-known portrayals of Maimonides. According to Ron Sigad, Mendelssohn harbored thoroughly traditional memories and hopes for a Jewish polity ruled by God, while his "liberal" appeal for the separation of church and state was an instrumental concession to the regrettable reality of the Galut. For Julius Guttmann, Mendelssohn was a man within whom traditional piety coexisted "side by side" with the universalistic religious sensibility of the Enlightenment, with any possible "inner turmoil" obviated</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 409 by a kind of unself-conscious compartmentalization. Alexander Altmann saw Mendelssohn as a largely successful harmonizer, open-mindedly assimilating Enlightenment currents into the fabric of Judaism while employing his Jewish perspective to make genuine innovations in European thought at the highest level. For Leo Strauss, Mendelssohn was a largely unsuccessful compromiser, unaware of the degree to which he had modified the sterner features of traditional Judaism by presenting it as a "consolatory" teaching, an "Epicurean" adulteration giving primacy to the assurance of felicity. Allan Arkush's new book sets forth yet another view of Mendelssohn, presenting him as a "radical" in traditional clothing. Arkush's Mendelssohn is a devotee of "natural religion"whose statements on supernatural revelation are to be taken with a measure of suspicion. while Mendelssohn seems to have anticipated a steady deintensification of halakhic observance, as Jews assumed both the rights and duties of citizenship, Arkush does not believe that he would necessarily have bewailed such an eventuality. The structure of Arkush's book leads from the universal to the particular and from the metaphysical to the political and programmatic. Arkush begins by setting Mendelssohn in the metaphysical tradition of Liebniz and Wolff. Subsequently, he takes up the question of the degree to which Mendelssohn actually remained within this tradition after the advent of Kant's Critique. In his discussion of Mendelssohn's political thought, Arkush locates an incon- sistency between his strenuous insistence on the inalienability of conscience and some of his more cautious remarks on the question of censorship and state supervision of the activities of atheists. It is in the chapter entitled "Spinoza and Other Adversaries" that Arkush begins to lay the groundwork for his main thesis. In contradistinction to Guttmann, Arkush does not believe that the pervasive ethos of the "conservative" or "moderate" enlightenment made it perfectly acceptable for Mendelssohn to profess belief in miracles and supernatural revela- tion. The writings of Spinoza, Reimarus, Lessing, the English Deists, and Voltaire had made significant inroads into German theo-political thinking by Mendelssohn's time. The Bible had been disparaged as the artlessly composed repository of irrational teachings, its heroes cast as unworthy role-models, and its addressees as credulous witnesses. For Arkush, then, it becomes a matter of first importance to find out whether Medelssohn actually took up these challenges, or merely tried to "deflect" them by artuful rhetoric. Arkush maintains that Mendelssohn studiously avoided a direct confronta- tion with biblical criticism and consciously remained within the confines of</page><page sequence="3">410 BOOK REVIEWS medieval arguments for the veracity of Scripture, knowing all the while that Saadia's claims for the reliability of tradition as transmitted by generations of adherents, Halevi's appeal to the consensus of the three monotheistic faiths, and Maimonides' reliance on the public nature of the theophany at Sinai could not really stand up to the likes of Spinoza and Reimarus. Elsewhere, Mendelssohn himself cautions against the manipulability of the naive "common heap" by devious clerics and downplays literal revelation as an inferior mode of divine communication meant for those too insensitive to read the divine inscription in nature. These inconsistencies, and others, serve as the basis for Arkush's claim that that Mendelssohn merely wished to give the appearance of traditionality, so as not to burn his bridges to the Jewish community. As far as his German readers are concerned, his political aim in Jerusalem was to project a Judaism which could never contribute to civil strife, since it contained no discrete doctrines beyond those deemed essential to the underpinning of moral conduct. In reducing Judaism to a revealed law, meant to provide mere supplementary aid in the maintenance of universal truths, he wished to pave the way for the civil integration of the Jews, while allowing Judaism a harmless modicum of particularity. While Arkush places Menelssohn in the tradition of Liebniz and Wolff in respect of his metaphysical first principles, he places him in the tradition of Spinoza and Locke as regards his political "use" of theology. Spinoza reduced the "essence" of the Bible to justice, charity, and love of neighbor, dismissing the ritual law deriving from the ancient biblical theocracy as irrevocably superseded. This, in order to allow for a liberal civil religion based on the authority of the Bible. Similarly, Locke "pared down" the Bible to the belief in Jesus' messiahship and the possibility of repentance in the interest of a similar political program. Mendelssohn, then, is also to be seen as a "reducer" of the Bible, this time to "law" alone, in order to facilitate the civil integration of the Jews without alienating either the Jewish leadership or those German forces who might construe Jewish specificity as a stimulus to civil strife. From a methodological standpoint, Arkush devotes much attention to locating contradictions in Mendelssohn's writings. Unlike Altmann, he does not undertake to harmonize them, and unlike Guttmann, he does not prefer to leave them in place as evidence of a bifurcated consciousness. In somewhat Straussian fashion, he sees the contradictions as conscious and deliberate, giving indication of a "public" and a "private" Mendelssohn. Arkush does not really follow Strauss in his interpretation of Mendelssohn,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 411 however. He rather "out-Strausses" Strauss, as least as far as Mendelssohn is concerned. It would appear that Strauss did not consider Mendelssohn to have been a thinker of the "rank" that would justify a comprehensive esoteric reading, although he did point to certain discrepancies between Mendelssohn's personal beliefs and his public statements on isolated issues. For Strauss, Mendelssohn represented the superficial attempt of the "mod- erate enlightement" to defensively "parry" the quarrel between Spinoza and Orthodoxy by blunting the totality of both the biblical and the philosophical claim. Arkush, on the other hand, appears to have inherited from Altmann, his teacher, a greater respect for Mendelsohn as a thinker of rank, who must therefore be conscious of his own contradictions. Since Altmann left him "Makom Le'Hitgader Bo" (as Arkush states on p. ix) by leaving many of Mendelssohn's contradictions unreconciled, Arkush picks up where he left off. Rather than continue the work of harmonization, however, he gives evidence of having appropriated the enhanced status that Altmann attributed to Mendelssohn by making him eligible for a full-blown Straussian analysis. It could be that Arkush's perspective, namely that Mendelssohn was secretly a radical enlightener who reflected on Judaism from the position of one who did not really believe in supernatural revelation, prevents him from considering the possibility that Mendelssohn may also have undertaken a radical critique of the Enlightenment from a standpoint derived from Jewish tradition, however refined. Mendelssohn's long "digression" in Jerusalem on the inadequacy of propositional language for the embodiment of religious insights and on the idolatry of the written word need not be seen only as a mere prelude to his praise of the mitzvot as "action-language." It can also be seen as part of a somewhat disguised, yet nonetheless comprehensive critique of the Christian tendency to doctrinalize the spirit, a tendency that persists in the steril discursive culture of the Enlightenment. If Mendelssohn indeed wrote circumspectly, then it could be that the very passages he downplays as "digressions" and "surmises" point to important components of his personal worldview. If that is so, and his reservations about the lack of social and religious vitality obtaining in the mediated book culture of his time are set as an introduction to a long excursus on the origins of idolatry, then what we may have here is a blistering critique of the "logocentric" character of Western culture undertaken by an eighteenth-century Jew speaking out of an alternative tradition. Arkush's portrayal of Mendelssohn as an "avant-garde" enlightener also prevents him from considering the possibility that his connection with me-</page><page sequence="5">412 BOOK REVIEWS dieval Jewish thought may have been more than merely mercenary. Even if it is calimed that Mendelssohn "uses" Maimonides' overt statements on the public nature of the theophany at Sinai in order to present a traditionalist persona, this does not mean that Mendelssohn did not assimilate a ore essential, though perhaps less explicit, Maimonidean influence on the issue of the origins and persistence of idolatry. Certain features of Mendelssohn's discourse on the development of idolatry in Jerusalem suggest a link with Maimonides' famous introduction to the Laws Concerning Idolatry in the Mishneh Torah. For Maimonides, for example, the first deviation from humanity's original acknowledgment of the absolute sovereignty of the one God derives from an "error." The stars, accorded glory by God Himself, are deemed worthy of worship by men who wish to adore those beings whom God invested with heavenly status. For Mendelssohn, idolatry begins when moral attributes of God are represented by the typical qualities of animals which are then concretized by hieroglyphic symbols. Subsequently, people "mistakenly" attribute Godlike qualities to the animals themselves, and proceed to develop the most repulsive forms of animal worship. Further on in his account, Maimonides introduces the factor of "clerical exploitation," as "false prophets" play on the fears of the populace and advise them that certain stars have the power to bestow earthly benefits and withhold sustenance. The exacerbation of idolatrous tendencies by the "religious usurpation" of "wily priests" figures in Mendelssohn's version as well. Ultimately, for Maimonides, the way back to the original insight is barred by the habituation of the populace to starworship. The verbal efforts of philosophers like Abraham to reeducate his followers have only a very limited effect in the face of a powerful idolatrous culture like that of the Egyptians. Only the embodiment of the original insight in a comprehensive, ubiquitous, legal counterculture carries the hope of restoration. Likewise, Mendelssohn also expresses pessimism concerning the efforts of philosophers to reorient the masses. Only the action symbols of Judaism seem to provide some hope of repristinization. While the suggestion of links between Maimonidean insights on the perversion of religion with Mendelssohn's critique of the idolatry of his own time needs to be further substantiated, the possibility that Mendelssohn viewed the price of the proliferation of literacy in modem times with Maimonidean eyes should perhaps not be discounted. Whatever is missing from Arkush's analysis, however, is more than made up for by what his book contains: some excellent close readings of deliberate smoke screens set up by Mendelssohn to blunt controversial statements (see</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 413 especially his reading of Mendelssohn's account of the Seven Noahide Laws), a cogently argued structural comparison of Mendelssohn's political project with that of Spinoza and Locke, and comprehensive comparisons of positions expressed by Mendelssohn throughout the whole range of his public and private works. Rather than "set proper limits to reverence for his profundity as a thinker," however (as Kenneth Hart Green writes in his back-cover appraisal), I believe that Arkush has accomplished the very opposite by his analysis of Mendelssohn's contradictions. What Arkush has actually done is to enhance our awareness of Mendelssohn's subtlety and skill in hiding his perhaps not-so-limited personal views from his less-discerning readers.
