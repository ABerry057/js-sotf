MAGNUS The struggle for Jewish emancipation in Germany is commonly under- stood as a battle for civic equality at the state level.' But an important chapter in the history of emancipation took place in the conflict between German states and localities over Jewish rights.2 Jurisdictional battles over Jewish status may seem quintessentially medieval, recalling the strife between competing levels of the feudal hierarchy for control of the Jews and the revenue they generated. Yet similar struggles persisted well into the nine- teenth century in several German states, such as Bavaria, Baden, and Wi:rt- This article is based on chapter 4 of my dissertation, "Cologne: Jewish Emancipation in a German City, 1798-1871," Columbia University, 1988.

Struggles over Jewish civic status-not just over which rights Jews might enjoy, but over which level of government would decide-raged in the first half of the nineteenth century. They were an integral part of broader dis- putes between states and localities over Burgeraufnahme, the admission of outsiders into the privileges of citizenship, including the right to settle and do legally recognized business.3 As such, they were part of a broader and very bitter constitutional conflict, long unresolved in Germany. As in the medieval period, sovereignty and finances were at the heart of modern struggles for control of Jewish status. States tended to regard Jews positively, as a means through which to stimulate trade, while localities viewed them as subverters of traditional economic patterns. Winning the right to admit or restrict Jewish participation in the local economy touched on issues far beyond the status of generally small Jewish communities, and so in modernity, as in previous eras, Jews symbolized power and control- or the lack thereof. While disputes between localities and states over Jewish status tended to occur where state governments were weak, a full-fledged local challenge for control over Jewish Bargeraufnahme occurred even in Prussia, the most centralized and powerful of German states. The outcome here was very dif- ferent than in similar struggles in southern Germany, where, in the years fol- lowing the Napoleonic wars, state governments were forced to acquiesce to local demands. Prussia never yielded its prerogative over the citizenship of Jews or anyone else, even temporarily. But this does not make the challenge any less significant. The fact that such a challenge occurred, its motives and meaning, is as significant as its outcome. Cologne, the largest and commercially most important city in the Rhine Province, threw down the gauntlet, with the city's new Jewish community, established under the French only twenty years earlier, the object of the con- test. Neither the place nor the time of the challenge was accidental. Cologne's challenge, I am convinced, was part of a broader, prolonged, and bitter struggle between city and state. While the history of that struggle has 3. On state-locality Bargeraufnahme disputes, see Walker, German Home Towns, chaps. 8, 9, and 10.

Here, as in general, the Jewish question is a window on the dynamics of non-Jewish society. But the fractured nature of the German political scene prior to unifica- tion in 1871 makes the state-locality perspective equally crucial to Jewish historians studying Jewish emancipation in Germany. The struggle over Cologne's Jews, and others like it elsewhere in Germany, were an integral part of the broader struggle over the Jewish place in modern German society. Localism was a potent political force in pre-unification Germany, and its relationship to the prolonged and agonized debate over Jewish rights deserves serious attention. The present study is intended to help illuminate this dimension of German Jewish emancipation. My purpose is threefold: to place the city-state dispute for control of Jewish status into the larger context of Cologne's strife-ridden relations with Prussia between 1815 and 1830; to assess the motives of the disputants, evaluating the place of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism in the conflict; and to consider Jewish responses to the obstacles Jews encountered, passing beyond images of Jews as mere objects of a contest. Background to the Conflict over Jewish Status Cologne was a city with long, proud traditions of self-rule and governing sensibilities much wounded in modernity. An autonomous city (freie Reichs- 4. The most comprehensive political history of Cologne in the modern era is Eberhard Gothein's masterly Verfassungs- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte der Stadt C61n vom Untergange der Reichsfreiheit bis zur Erichtung des Deutschen Reiches (Cologne, 1916) (hereafter cited as Stadt C61n). Gothein takes the barest notice of the prolonged city-state dispute over the Jews (pp. 312-313), though he treats other aspects of relations between Berlin and Cologne with great thoroughness. There have been a number of general works on the Jews of Cologne and one recent social history of the community in the first half of the nineteenth century: Ernst Weyden, Geschichte der Juden in Kbln am Rhein von der Romerzeiten bis auf die Gegenwart (Cologne, 1867); Carl Brisch, Geschichte der Juden in Coin und Umgebung aus iltester Zeit bis auf die Gegenwart (Miilheim am Rhein, 1879); Adolf Kober, Cologne (Philadelphia, 1940); Alwin Miiller, Die Geschichte der Juden in Kiln von der Wiederzulassung 1798 bis um 1850 (Cologne, 1984). To varying degrees, all catalogue the city's stance against Jewish rights but none analyzes it. The same is true of Rolf Hahn, "Das 'schdindliche Dekret' vom 17.3.1808 und seine Aus- wirkung auf die rechtliche Stellung der K61lner Juden" (doctoral diss., Law Faculty of the Uni- versity of Cologne, 1967).</page><page sequence="4">60 SHULAMIT S. MAGNUS stadt) in the Holy Roman Empire since 1475, its municipal regime was abolished in 1797 by French revolutionary forces conquering the left bank of the Rhine. France soon annexed the territory, and the new municipal government established in Cologne, like those of all French cities, was placed under tight state control. Cologne had an even longer tradition of anti-Semitism. Having expelled the Jews in 1424, the city zealously guarded its sovereign right de non toler- andisjudaeis for nearly four hundred years thereafter. Jews were completely barred from residence or trade, and even transit visits were rigidly con- trolled. In this sphere, too, modernity broke roughly over the city. When the French abolished residence restrictions on left-bank Jewry, Cologne was opened to Jewish settlement. By 1814, the end of French rule, the city had a Jewish population of over two hundred, a sizable number by contemporane- ous regional standards.5 Full civic equality for the Jews lasted only ten years, until the introduc- tion of Napoleon's "infamous decree" of 1808. This law prejudged Jews to be guilty of practicing usury and fraud and required them to procure special "Jew licenses" (Judenpatente,) valid for only a year at a time, in order to do legally recognized business. The law also forbade Jews from crossing depart- mental lines unless it was to practice agriculture.6 The first of these provi- sions burdened Jews with the humiliating necessity of continually proving themselves honest businesspeople and put them on the defensive vis-a-vis Christian competitors. The second provision loomed as a death-knell for the community, founded as it was on immigration. But making the Jews and their doings a perennial item on government agendas had weighty consequences for non-Jewish society as well.

The typical Jewish community on the left bank of the Rhine at the beginning of the cen- tury numbered less than fifty while the long-established Jewish community of Bonn numbered just over three hundred in 1808.

Because the 1808 decree remained in force on the German Rhine until 1845, it not only shaped Jewish reality for decades, but made Jews a prominent and ongoing irritant in city-state relations. French rule revolutionized Cologne's economy as well as its politics. Cologne's traditional economy, based on the transshipment of goods being moved along the Rhine, was undermined when the French abolished or cut back medieval river privileges which allowed the city to tax passing boats and monopolize the transshipment and forwarding of cargoes.8 The French policy infuriated the city's old governing elite, composed of great merchants and bankers whose wealth and power derived from river trade and the port. This elite greeted the French withdrawal in January 1814 as an oppor- tunity to restore the city's autonomy and erstwhile powers. The year before Cologne, along with the rest of the left bank of the Rhine, formally passed to Prussia, this staunchly Catholic clique even advocated the city's return to free imperial status-bespeaking a hoped-for revival of the Holy Roman Empire under the ascendancy of Catholic, imperial Austria.9 With the Prussian takeover in 1815, any such hopes were decisively dashed. The disparity between the city's grandiose expectations and Prus- sia's far more modest intentions received tangible expression when Prussia denied the city's request for permission even to expand beyond the increas- ingly cramped girdle of its ancient walls. To policy makers in Berlin, fearful of a revanchist France, Cologne was first and foremost a fortress city; its greater ambitions would simply have to be contained. The disappointment of Cologne's partriciate with the reality of the Prussian connection received its classic expression in the lament of one of its more prominent members: "We have married into a poor family." With a population of fifty thousand, Cologne was the region's most 7.

Barring full autonomy, its representatives argued for a privi- leged position in any future assembly of the Rhenish provincial estates. They failed. Behind this effort was a frantic hope to have Cologne's ancient river privileges restored. Cologne's Chamber of Commerce argued the case for restoration before the provisional Prussian government in Aachen. Dogged efforts were also made to influence the Congress of Vienna, which, however, declared against Rhine River tolls. City representatives and the Chamber of Commerce pressed Berlin on this issue into the late 1820s but ultimately could do no more than settle for indemnification. The city also suffered defeat and rebuff, sometimes incidental, sometimes quite deliberate, as Berlin decided the shape of government and administra- tion in Prussia's new Rhine Province. Far from being accorded any special status, Cologne was absorbed into the administrative structure of the pro- vince. In an unmistakable slap at the city's political pretensions, Koblenz, a backwater compared to Cologne, was named provincial capital.'0 Cologne was made the seat of the government district in which it was located-but this only placed it under the close watch of the district president (Regier- ungspriisident,) a Prussian official with extensive power over local affairs and a direct line to Berlin." The city fared no better at the most local level of provincial organization. In recognition of its size, it was allowed to constitute its own Kreis, or county, rather than being joined to neighboring towns and villages. But the Kreis Cologne and the municipality were kept distinct administrative enti- ties. The mayor's office was not charged with running Kreis affairs, which included such critical tasks as maintaining military security and public order, executing state economic policy, and overseeing revenue collection and disbursement. These duties, as in all Kreise, were entrusted to a royally 10. Diefendorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, pp. 239, 263-264. 11.

City represen- tatives pressed for some version of Stein's Stadteordnung, enacted in Prussia in 1808, which encouraged the existence of a strong local oligarchy. Instead, Berlin decided to retain the French system under which cities were tightly controlled by the central government, with mayors appointed by the state and town councils having advisory functions only. The only change was the transfer of local police functions from the municipality to the state, a woeful modification. The outcome of this joust with Berlin incensed the new, Prussian- appointed mayor of Cologne, altk3ln scion Karl Joseph Freiherr von Mylius."3 Insult was added to injury when the new royal police president turned out to be a foreigner, a Protestant, and a Prussian patriot, one Georg Karl Phillip von Struensee.14 Von Mylius tried desperately to convince the Prussian authorities to abolish Struensee's position, the more so since the latter was also named Landrat, for with authority over economic as well as police functions, Struensee, in effect, was the mayor's overseer. Von Mylius failed. When in 1819 he was also unable to prevent the Prussians from abolishing the city's indirect tax, a mainstay of its revenue base, he quit his office in disgust. Two deputies discharged the mayor's duties until 1823, when a new mayor, Adolf Steinberger, was appointed. Steinberger was as accommodat- 12.

MAGNUS ing as von Mylius had been cantankerous; he suited the new realities well. This wealthy, "much-occupied notary" was the ideal officeholder-from Berlin's perspective. Cologne's archbishop, who would have preferred a more assertive character in the mayor's chair, called him the "imbecile Oberbitrgermeister" and wished him a short career. It was not to be. Stein- berger served until 1848. Von Mylius's departure from office has been seen as a watershed in the city's history, the end of grand challenges to Prussia's will. This is a view particularly stressed by city historian Eberhard Gothein. Mayor Stein- berger, Gothein says, was no match for Struensee, a tough, determined administrator, while the hamstrung, demoralized (and, according to Got- hein, spineless) City Council continually lost ground to the much more vigorous Chamber of Commerce in pressing the city's interests before the Prussians.'5 The Chamber of Commerce, created by the French, had indeed, become an institution of considerable political significance.'6 The French had given its members, founders and scions of Cologne's greatest trade and banking houses, an important consultative role in the administration of economic policy. This precedent of access to and indirect participation in government carried over into the Prussian period. While the mayor's office and the entire apparatus of city government were absorbed into the Prussian bureaucracy and thus, according to Gothein, robbed of independence, the Chamber, as a "semi-official" institution, retained far greater freedom of action as a kind of "loyal opposition."'7 From the outset of Prussian rule through the 1840s, the Chamber vigor- ously championed the city's business community, challenging a host of Prussian economic policies. As it increasingly took on the role of city defender, it became the competitor of the City Council, whose mantle in this 15. Gothein, Stadt C61n, pp. 220-222, 240 ff.; cf.

A bitter power struggle between the two institutions marked the period.'8 There is no challenging this basic presentation of the city's history. Yet there is evidence, ignored by Gothein and other city historians, in which the City Council emerges as anything but submissive toward the Prussians. That evidence is contained in the documents recording the implementation in Cologne of Napoleon's "infamous decree" of 1808.19 On the basis of these records, we might say that if the era of grand municipal campaigns against Prussian authority ceased with von Mylius, an era of determined and audacious rear-guard actions was only just beginning. What I would call the city government's "war of attrition" with Prussia over control of Jewish status in Cologne was motivated by genuine abhor- rence of Jews and: not simply, as Gothein would have it, by a (to him, admir- able) "meticulous accuracy" in administering Napoleonic law.20 As Gothein himself notes, such exactitude was lacking on other issues; moreover, as we shall see, the city's punctiliousness in applying even the 1808 decree was of a very peculiar nature. Jews were no incidental targets of municipal bookkeeping. Their new- ness in Cologne's rigidly stratified society made them outsiders par excel- lence, while the 1808 law touched on the most sensitive area of a com- munity's prerogatives: the power to decide who might live in its midst and enjoy access to its resources and opportunities.21 A Judenpatent, moreover, was a passport not only to discrete economic rights but to privileged social standing. With it, a lowly Jude passed out of stigmatized status and became 18.

MAGNUS a Kaufmann, a recognized member of the most respected social group in Cologne: the business class.22 Cologne's merchants zealously guarded entry into their ranks; what was in general a highly restrictionist admissions policy became particularly so with regard to the despised Jews, traditional objects of city control and exclusion. The city's anti-Jewish stance was also a means of resisting the encroach- ments of Prussian rule, since the Prussians posed as the ultimate arbiters of Jewish status. Economics and communal ego were at stake, and Jews became genuine and strategic targets. Coming to Terms with the Jewish Presence: The Battle of City and Provincial Bureaucracies The most striking aspect of the dispute between the municipal and pro- vincial authorities over the Jews of Cologne, which lasted more than a decade, is that none of the principals disagreed about fundamentals: all upheld the 1808 decree. The law was declared operational as soon as the Prussian provincial administration on the Rhine took over; Berlin formally renewed the decree in 1818 and repeatedly thereafter, ultimately retaining it until 1845.23 Mayor von Mylius strongly endorsed the law, and when Cologne's Chamber of Commerce was consulted, it took an even more re- strictionist line toward the Jews than the City Council.24 22. As Ayqoberry writes, "Le titre de 'marchand' est . .. port6 avec fiert6; en un age ennemi des sup6rlatifs, il ne s'accompagne plus comme autre fois de l'6pithete 'honorable,' et pas encore de l'6pith6te 'grand': pourtant il implique l'honneur en un certain sens de la grandeur, vertus acquises par h6ritage et formation plus que confer6es par une quelconque ordonnance.

It was one of the paradoxes of German Jewish life in the era of emancipation that entry to respectable non-Jewish society on the left bank of the Rhine had to be bought with a special "Jew patent." 23.

Article 16 of the law, barring Jews from moving from one administrative district (dipartement) to another unless they purchased and worked land, proved impossible to implement. Too many Jews were moving, much of the migration was to cities, and virtually all of it was for trade. This certainly was the case for Cologne. Some method of formally exempting urbanizing Jews from the article was necesary, but the decree made no provision for this. Moreover, with the French gone, there were no more departements. Across what boundary lines was Jewish migration to be measured? Enforcing article 7 of the decree, which mandated the special licenses Jews had to obtain, was even more problematic. The patents were to be granted upon the recommendation of a Jew's municipality that he or she had engaged neither in usury nor in other illicit business, and upon the testi- monial of the local consistorial synagogue that the candidate was a person of good conduct and integrity.25 But how, precisely, was a Jew's patent- worthiness to be established? Was each applicant to undergo a thorough investigation, and if so, which bureaucracy was to have the burden of carry- ing it out? An early French ordinance stated that the City Council was to decide on testimonial issuance by a simple majority vote, stating its grounds in case of a negative vote.26 But what kind, and how much justification of rejections was necessary? Or would municipal judgments readily be accepted by the provincial authorities who issued the actual patents? Who, in short-city or state-was to make the real decision about a Jew's worthiness for acceptance into the business community, who to be the mere ticket- stamper? The city and the Prussians fought over many details of the law, but underlying it all was this basic question of hegemony. The struggle began under von Mylius, heated up during the interregnum of the deputies from 25. Independent businesspeople were required to have patents; employees were not. Women, who often worked in family or other businesses, were required to have Judenpatente when they headed a business. This ocurred most often upon the death of a husband, but also in other circumstances. On women's economic activity, see my "Cologne," pp. 429 ff. Because Cologne had been part of France, Jewish religious life was organized under the centralized consistorial system established in France in 1806-1808. That remained the case until Prussia enacted its Jewry law of July 23, 1847. On the consistorial system, see Anchel, Napoleon et les Juifs; Schwartzfuchs, Napoleon, the Jews, and the Sanhedrin; and Phyllis Cohen Albert, The Modernization of French Jewry (Hanover, N.H., 1977). 26.

Throughout, the city rejected the burden of meticulous- ly documenting its implementation of the decree, while insisting on the right to make the ultimate decisions. For the Prussians, it was the same. The City's Position Disagreements between the city and the Prussians emerged as soon as the provincial government began to administer the 1808 decree. The first step was to get a count of Cologne's Jewish population and enough data on individual Jews for judgments about immigration status and Judenpatente to be made. In April 1817, the First Division of the Royal Government in Cologne, a branch of the district president's office responsible for religious minorities, ordered Police President Struensee to compile such data in minute detail.27 Name, birthplace, age, date of settlement on the left bank and in Cologne, occupation, and date of most recent patent were all to be noted for all Jews affected. Struensee was then to send his findings to Mayor von Mylius and the City Council, who would deliberate whether to issue the character testimonials required for the patents. Struensee and his police officers responded with alacrity; the data were ready for delivery to the city nine days later.28 But this and subsequent intel- ligence on the Jews only raised eyebrows at First Division and led to its most persistent complaint: the city was derelict in enforcing the 1808 law. None of the Jews on Struensee's list had been issued patents since 1813 and, though fourteen of the forty-two heads of household had come to the city since 1808, not one of them practiced agriculture.29 First Division would soon 27.

The city, it claimed further, was also doing nothing to police Jewish trading activities. Unpatented Jews, whose business agreements should have had no legal standing, were even making use of the courts! Jewish affairs were in com- plete disarray, First Division charged, because the city administration had recklessly disregarded a law provincial authorities had confirmed since 1814.30 Curiously, the city did not voice the obvious rejoinder: why had the provincial government waited more than three years since the Prussian takeover to begin enforcing the law?"3 The City Council expressed total sup- port for the immigration restrictions in article 16 of the decree, upon whose strict enforcement, it said, the welfare of Cologne's citizenry depended, but it also suggested that the state take measures to keep Jews from coming to Cologne and trading there in the first place. The city also returned another of First Division's accusations: why were Jews who had settled in violation of article 16 not being expelled?32 The city thought this an excellent idea- but left it to the Prussians to execute. June 29, 1820, population survey, six of forty-two male Jewish householders in the city did own Feldgiiter, but none of them cultivated this land themselves, and this, to the exclusion of com- merce, was required under the decree. 30. First Division to von Mylius, June 17, 1817; First Division to Struensee, August 5, 1817. 31. The three-year delay in enforcing the 1808 decree is attributable to stresses on the new provincial government after the 1814 takeover, not to any ideological faltering. When the Prus- sian authorities in Cologne began enforcing the decree in 1817, it was with deadly earnest. First Division insisted that Jews either have patents or be denied the right to trade, pending possible expulsion, and this demand was enforced. While Struensee gathered intelligence and the City Council deliberated its issuance of testimonials in the spring of 1817, First Division authorized von Mylius to issue temporary trading permits to Jews who had lived in the city since 1808 and "conducted themselves blamelessly." First Division to von Mylius, April 18, 1817. The fact that the banker Salomon Oppenheim Jr., among others, urgently applied for such a permit indicates the stringency of the crackdown.

MAGNUS There can be no doubt about the sincerity and depth of official Cologne's antipathy for Jews, expressions of which permeate all its dealings on the subject. If the city had been (and would continue to be) sloppy with regard to the 1808 law, it was not for lack of sympathy with the decree's goals, since it consistently took the most restrictive interpretation of the mandated controls on Jewish activities. Yet not just the substance of pro- posed city policy on the Jews, but the fact of it, served another purpose: asserting a claim for autonomy. The city's insistence on interpreting and enforcing the 1808 law according to its own lights was a jab at the painful reality of Prussian annexation. Thus, for instance, the Council for years denied patent testimonials to Jews who had migrated from locations outside the former French Roer dipartement, although the left bank was now divided into Prussian Regier- ungsbezirke, not French departments. Did not the 1808 law specifically restrict migration between dipartements? the city pointedly asked. The Council was of the opinion, Mayor von Mylius informed First Division in a communication positively bristling with resistance, that Prussia's redivision of the territory into Regierungsbezirke had no bearing on the "political status of the inhabitants."33 Accordingly, Jews coming from nearby Bonn, which was now located in the same Regierungsbezirk as Cologne but had previously been in a different dipartement, were deemed migrants from a "foreign region," subject to article 16 of the 1808 law and ineligible for patent consideration in Cologne.34 Not surprisingly, the provincial authorities and the Ministry of Interior rejected this reasoning, on which point the city acquiesced.35 There were other ways to deny Jews patents. Kurt Grossman, (Heidelberg, 1970), p. 47. There never was a case of an illegal Jewish immi- grant to Cologne being expelled, though First Division repeated its call for this in a letter to Struensee on October 5, 1818. 33. Council session, November 20, 1817. 34. One of the Jews in question, Alexander Oppenheim, had already been denied the Council's testimonial on other pretexts-he was never accused of usury or other illicit business dealings-and had vigorously appealed the verdict. The Council then created this reason for denial, which, of course, had broader implications. On Oppenheim, see Police Inspector Werner to von Mylius, April 30, 1817; Oppenheim's petition to Werner, May 1, 1817; City Council session, May 21, 1817; and below, "Jewish Responses." 35.

First Division conveyed this judgment to Struensee and rejected testimonial denials based on the Council's interpretation. Article 16, First Division declared, restricted the migration of</page><page sequence="15">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 71 The City Council received considerable help toward this goal from the police inspectors of Cologne's four sections and the Chamber of Commerce, to which it turned for "expert advice" in evaluating the business reputations of Jews on Struensee's list.36 Both went well beyond simple comments about the Jews' guilt or innocence of usury or illicit business activity to create other grounds for the denial of patents. Several of the police inspectors expressed prejudices about Jewish petty trade, which was not a crime under the 1808 law. One of them recommended, to good effect, that a testimonial be denied a Jew whose occupation, old clothes' trading, lacked social status, but who otherwise enjoyed a good business reputation.37 The Chamber of Commerce warned in dire tones about the dangers of Jewish immigration and the need for enforcement of article 16 of the decree, about which its opinions had not been asked. In line with its quasi- governmental pretensions, however, the Chamber felt a mandate to advise on general welfare. To its mind, the requirement of Judenpatente was a wholly inadequate expedient against a very dangerous threat: the possible influx of mightily prolific Jews who, through their fertility, would "every- where gain footing like a voluptuous snaring weed."38 The Chamber of Commerce divided the city's Jews into three categories. In the first were long-settled Jews with solid reputations, who were to be granted patents for "unconditional" (business) rights. In the second were Jews whose "reputations were not entirely blameless" although they had committed no actual crime, who were to be given patents for "limited" rights. In the third were Jews who made their living in "any and all manner" and who in the Chamber's view "had earned no trust," although they too were not necessarily charged with a specific crime. These were to be denied all (merchants') rights.39 "alien, that is, foreign Jews," not Jews who possessed French citizenship at the time of the decree's issuance.

MAGNUS The Chamber did not define its terms, but we can deduce its intentions from a look at which Jews it placed in the various categories. Not surpris- ingly, Cologne's wealthiest Jews were in the first. In the third were one Jew with a genuinely suspect record as well as fifteen others whose only offense appears to have been the practice of petty trade or recent arrival in the city. The Jews in the second class lay somewhere between these poles. Of forty- two Jewish householders on Struensee's list, the Chamber classed fifteen in the first category, eleven in the second, and sixteen (38 percent) in the third. Von Mylius and the Council adopted the Chamber's innovation without crediting its source, revising upward the number of Jews recommended for patents: assigning nineteen to the first class and thirteen to the second, deny- ing testimonials to nine applicants (21 percent).40 Most importantly, the municipality defined what placed Jews with questionable reputations in the second, "limited" patent category: having previously been granted a patent and having given no legal cause to be denied one. This liberal-sounding provision was actually a device to broaden the Council's scope for denying patents, since prior receipt of a patent could now be made a precondition for receiving one in the future. Applied strictly, this provision would have frozen patent distribution at its 1813 level, since that was the last time patents had been issued.41 In this manner, the city hoped not only to dimin- ish the already established Jewish population, not all of whom possessed dicates that it was referring to kaufmdnnischen Rechten, merchant's rights, in the usual sense. More than a decade later, the Chamber stated explicitly that this was its intention; see Chamber to Mayor Steinberger, May 14, 1828. "Merchants' rights" conferred freedom to conduct busi- ness, including wholesale trade; more generally, it meant acceptance into the business com- munity. See Diefendorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, pp. 18-19; Aygoberry, "Histoire Sociale," vol. 2, appendices 9 and 10, pp. 47, 57; Miiller, Geschichte der Juden in K61n, p. 198, n. 1. 40. In the first Council session on Judenpatente since the Prussian takeover, on May 21, 1817. 41. As the Council asserted at its meeting of April 18, 1818, and at subsequent sessions, "Jews who did not obtain a recommendation earlier should not receive one now either, since regarding Jews who had previously lived here, the City Council has no grounds to place more trust in them than they enjoyed at the time the requisite certificate was first denied, and con- cerning Jews who have moved here, these have not demonstrated that they have devoted them- selves to agriculture." Cf. the Council's further rationale for this aspect of its policy in its letter to First Division, December 21, 1818. See the Council decision on Judenpatente of May 19, 1820, among others, for examples of Jews being denied patents merely "because [they] did not possess a patent earlier."</page><page sequence="17">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 73 patents, but more importantly, to sabotage the immigration of Jews who, since 1818, had been able to obtain Prussian exemption from article 16 and permission to settle as merchants.42 In 1821, when the Council was headed by deputies, nonmembership in the Jewish community was added as grounds for denying patent testimonial to recent immigrants who had pre- viously been patented.43 None of this-the three-class division, the creation of first- and second- degree patents, the contrivance of prerequisites for patent consideration, grounds other than business crime for the denial of patents-had any basis in the 1808 law, as First Division began informing the Council. But the city, egged on by the Chamber of Commerce, was adamant about its right to judge who was acceptable as a member of its business class, which both bodies consistently identified with society as a whole.44 The city was particularly insistent about its role in controlling Jewish immigration. As it repeatedly told First Division, "no single city, including this one, can be obliged to accept all Israelites born in the kingdom and to permit them to settle and practice trade without futher ado .... The Coun- cil believes it to be most necessary to abide by the most exact legal limita- tions on Jewish residence because the opportunities are more abundant and the ways and means of practicing usury are far more readily available in a large city than elsewhere."45 The city had already stated that inhibiting 42. On this exemption, see First Division to Struensee, October 5, 1818. Several specimens of such exemptions are extant in the Council's records. J. Eschrott (Aschrott)'s, granted by the Ministry of Interior on April 15, 1820, reads: the Ministry will "permit you to settle in Cologne, freeing you of the obligation to devote yourself exclusively to agriculture, to which end the Royal Government there is to be furnished with instructions." The Council denied Eschrott a patent anyway until forced by the Prussians to relent. See Council session, July 20, 1820, and Chamber of Commerce to City, August 11, 1821, lamenting the Prussian decision. 43. This seems to have been the Council's innovation. See "Nachweisung der im Stadt Kreise C61n wohnenden Handels- und Gewerbe treibenden Israeliten" of November 28, 1821, denials to Moises Cassel, Ezechiel Ritter, Leib Voss. 44. It is clear from the context that when the Chamber or the Council used the terms "the public" or "public opinion," they were referring to the city's trading community. 45. Even in perceived victimization, it seems, Cologne wanted special status. Cited in the Council's deliberations of May 21, 1819, and May 19, 1820, and in others. Apparently, the city got the latter formulation, along with other structural elements of its Jewish policy, from the Chamber of Commerce. Two weeks before the Council session in which this formulation was expressed, the Chamber had sent the city a letter which contained a virtually identical, though more elaborate and vicious, paragraph on the Jews.

Limiting Jewish immigration to Cologne by manipulating Judenpatente requirements was a city prerogative. While the Chamber of Commerce and the City Council shared a special horror of Jewish immigration, that is, a fear of "new" Jews, they did not necessarily trust "old" Jews either. Analysis of the cases in which the Coun- cil denied its testimonial in 1820 and 1821 shows that long-settled Jews, including people who had immigrated before the 1808 decree, were denied testimonials without being charged with any particular misdeed.46 The Chamber of Commerce expressed dire concerns about the activities of Jews already in the city, even those with patents. "The public," it alleged in 1820, was convinced that such Jews would secretly begin practicing usury and other illegal activities at the first opportunity; there was no need for the Chamber to substantiate this view.47 Several years later, though, the Council triumphantly produced proof: three patented Jews accused of practicing usury and fraud. The case against these three, it said, only bolstered the "public's view" that legal restrictions ought to be scrupulously applied "against all Jews, without exception."48 For all the rhetoric, the Council's record of patent recommendations shows that it was willing to have a small Jewish population. As Table I shows, the Council granted most requests for testimonials. The same was true even for the Chamber of Commerce, which, despite all its vitriol, had judged most Jews on Struensee's initial list worthy of patenting. Faced with the evidence on the Jews actually in the city, the city authorities obviously concluded that some Jews were acceptable, as long as their practices were carefully controlled. But they were not willing to face an unimpeded influx. 46. Three of eight Jews whose applications were rejected in May 1820 fit this description. The reason given for their denials was that they had not previously held patents; a fourth "long-timer" who was denied a testimonial had held a patent previously, but was accused of association with thieves. Five of fifteen Jews denied testimonials in 1821 had lived in the city since before 1808, three of them had even held patents. A fourth was denied merely because the Council said it "knew nothing about him." 47. Chamber to Council, May 3, 1820. 48. Council session, July 30, 1822.

Note the figure for 1821. It was this City Council patent deliberation which First Division completely rejected, setting off the showdown of 1825. In 1822, while the Council was still refractory, the number of those rejected was again unusually high. From 1825, rejections were rare. These figures reflect only the endorsements granted by the Council. The number of actual Judenpatente issued was often higher, because the Prussians overturned some of the council's denials of recommendations or because applications held in abeyance at the time of a Council vote were later approved. Ultimately, more important than the actual number of patents granted or denied was the power to decide the issue. To make its claim perfectly clear to the Prussians, the city opposed Jewish immigration categorically, and the integration of already-resident Jews only slightly less absolutely. Not even wealth was a guarantee of favorable treatment. In a history of bitter strife</page><page sequence="20">76 SHULAMIT S. MAGNUS with the Prussians over many issues, the city's particular recalcitrance on the Jewish question is attributable to two crucial realities. Unlike trade or tariff policy, in which the city had no recognized voice, the 1808 decree gave municipalities some control over local Jewish affairs. And regarding the Jews, unlike other areas of disputed policy, state as well as city recognized the same law. The city's restrictive interpretation of the 1808 law was meant to defy Prussian rule, yet it also bespoke a genuine abhorrence for Jews. Sheer re- sistance to the Prussians could have been manifested by granting character testimonials liberally, without investigating a candidate's background, had Jews not been seen as a menace. Instead, the city denied testimonials with only the vaguest justification. The specifics of the 1808 decree forced the Council and the Chamber to cite some pretext for excluding Jews, but both bodies obviously viewed the legal niceties as formalities. Faced with the threat they perceived in the Jewish presence, the city authorities felt justified in taking whatever interpretive liberties seemed necessary. Prussian Attitudes and Policy This is where the city collided with the Prussian authorities at the provin- cial level (First Division) as well as the Ministry of Interior in Berlin. The Prussians, as we have seen, started out with an attitude toward the Jews as negative as that of the city. But this quickly changed. From demanding the expulsion of all Jews who immigrated in violation of article 16 or who were unpatented, and specifically of several the Council had particularly con- demned, First Division soon began championing Jews granted exemption from article 16 and demanding hard evidence that the allegedly bad Jews were really bad.49 The Prussians adopted an ostensibly literalist interpretation of the 1808 law, complaining that the city had blatantly disregarded some provisions of the legislation and fabricated others (which of course, it had), while the provincial government was upholding the law. It was not so simple. Both 49. Cf.

On the case of the "bad Jew" M. Pollack, see below, "Jewish Responses."</page><page sequence="21">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 77 Berlin and the Prussian authorities in Cologne took liberties with the decree, amending, even abrogating it. Berlin created a process whereby mercantile Jews could migrate to the city from across district boundaries, a basic sub- version of the decree. First Division overturned negative judgments by the City Council and granted patents to Jews who had never received the Coun- cil's recommendation, which was a stated prerequisite for the patent. And it demanded evidentiary proof of Jewish wrongdoing when the Council with- held its endorsement, a degree of specificity the degree had never mandated. The reasons for this changed attitude will be explored below. Suffice it here to say that where the city rarely admitted the possibility of "good" Jews, the Prussians were much more open-minded. The means they employed to protect "good" Jews was the "philistine fussiness" about procedure which state bureaucracies elsewhere in Germany used when con- fronted with local resistance to their authority.50 Some of this surely was strategic posturing. Yet First Division was genuinely horrified at what, in its view, was the city's completely arbitrary handling of Judenpatent recommendations. The 1808 law, it repeatedly told the Council, specified only usury or illicit trade as grounds for testimonial denial, charges which were to be substantiated. Yet the city had created whole new categories for denying recommendations, as well as denying them without justifying the grounds. First Division rejected Council denials of patent recommendations to Jews who had not previously held patents and, when a denial was based on a charge of usury or illicit trade, demanded that the Council "set out in minute and scrupulous detail the particular facts" of the case.5' It rejected, for example, the Council's denial of a recommendation to one Jew accused of dealing in stolen goods because the Council had submitted no evidence that a court had ever found the man guilty, while the Jew had marshaled considerable evidence of his innocence.52 50.

MAGNUS First Division went through the Council protocols on Judenpatente, meticulously noting changes in the status of a Jew from one Council deliber- ation to the next, as well as inconsistencies in the Council's treatment of Jews with ostensibly similar records. It demanded explanations, insisting on clarity and, above all, on conformity to the rules as it saw them. In short, First Division treated the City Council as the mere bureaucratic tool it judged the Council to be. The Prussians even found fault with the Council's technical procedures. Recommendations were voted at Council meetings lacking a quorum; they were not issued on proper Stempelpapier. Rather than issuing each success- ful applicant a document signed by the entire Council, the Council merely drew up a list of successful applicants and signed that.53 Particularly galling was the lackadaisical pace at which the city dealt with Jewish affairs. The Council took excessive amounts of time to process testimonial applications. It was particularly slow to meet First Division's increasingly frequent calls for clarifications, revisions, or, when an entire Council deliberation on Judenpatente was rejected, for special sessions.54 In 1820, possibly in response to problems with the city, the office of the Royal Government in Cologne set strict deadlines for each phase of the Judenpatent process for the entire government district of Cologne.55 Yet Cologne's Council was perenially late. What began with polite calls for speed ("could you please advise me about this matter as soon as possi- ble," Police President Struensee wrote the Mayor's Office in April 1820) soon turned nasty. "We summon you," First Division wrote the Mayor's 53. See First Division to Mayor, November 26, 1818; Police President Struensee to Mayor's Office, May 24, 1820; First Division to Mayor's Office, June 14, 1820; and especially the correspondence between First Division, Struensee, and the Mayor's Office, regarding the City Council session of November 28, 1821, notably, First Division to Mayor's Office Decem- ber 19, 1821. These and other regulations were spelled out in the "Verordnung und Bekannt- machung der K6niglichen Regierung," of February 26, 1820, Amtsblatt der Koniglichen Regierung zu K61n (1820), pp. 58-60. 54. The Council's November 28, 1821, session, for instance, was thrown out by First Divi- sion for a host of rules violations. As early as December 1818, the City Council held a special session after First Division rejected the minutes of a Council session held in the absence of a quorum.

The ever-punctual Struen- see, who needed the Council's full deliberations and final decisions on Judenpatente in order to make his own recommendations to the govern- ment, was driven to distraction by the city's behavior, imploring it to act with dispatch so that he could meet his own deadlines.57 By the winter of 1821-22, first Division was excoriating the Council for its so "indecently delayed deliberations on Jewish patents." Several months later it accused the city of deliberately obstructing the due process of law through chronic lateness.58 But the charge of passive aggression was only partly true, since the city also defied the Prussians openly, brazenly. One is rather inclined to take the city at its word when it explained delays and sessions held in the absence of a quorum. Members were out of town, particularly in the summer, while others were ill or attending to urgent business.59 The Mayor's Office needed time to investigate the backgrounds of Jews applying for patents for the first time, yet the Chamber of Commerce, to whom it referred such cases, was not always prompt in responding.60 56.

The Mayor's Office, for example, wrote the Chamber on July 26, 1821, with a list of the Jews to be investigated, soliciting the Chamber's negative comments "as soon as possible." The Chamber responded on August 11 with its own request for information. When, on October 29, the Mayor's Office had still not received the Chamber's recommendations, it wrote to urge speedier handling. The Council finally held its session on Judenpatente on November 28, 1821; we do not know if it had received the Chamber's recommendations. It was at this point that First Division first condemned the Council's "indecent delay" (letter of First Division, December 19, 1821), a charge subsequently repeated.

MAGNUS And the Jews were not the Council's most urgent problem, as it plainly told the Prussians several times.6 Cologne's economy was in the midst of a serious recession exacerbated, in the Council's view, by Prussian policies. The city was fighting a desperate battle with the provincial authorities againt a Prussian-imposed reform of the city's revenue structure. Were it not preoccupied with problems of Prussian making, the Council implied, it would have time to deal properly with the Jewish question. But, as it pointedly told Struensee and First Division in 1822, Judenpatente would simply have to wait until urgent work on taxes was completed.62 The city was already doing its job with regard to the Jews in a manner it deemed fitting. It simply lacked the time, energy, or sympathy for the meticulous documentation the Prussians were demanding. Nor was the Chamber of Commerce, on whom the Council attempted to foist the close work of testi- monial processing, willing to follow Prussian directives or timetables.63 Above all, the Council stressed, revealing its still-smoldering rage about the loss of police functions, if it was not being asked for a considered judg- ment about the Jews, but merely for a report on their criminal activities, the entire matter ought to be referred to the police-into whose hands Jewish affairs in Cologne had been delivered, in contrast to policy elsewhere.64 The Denouement Matters began to reach a head in the winter of 1821-22 when, after four years of inconclusive sparring, First Division decided to get tough. It is worth following developments closely from this point, since it was in these years, during the tenure of the deputies, that the Council's audacity in defy- ing the Prussians reached unprecedented heights. 61.

Charging that none of the required conventions had been observed, it returned the Council's minutes and ordered that a new session be held in scrupulous accord with the Royal Government's oft-repeated stipulations.65 Several months passed before the Council responded, only to reject the Prussian demands.66 The Royal Government, it said, was making the patenting procedure inordinately laborious by demanding individualized patent recommendations.67 The Council's practice of merely listing recipients and rejectees had been established under the French (who, it implied, had been far more rational on the subject). The Royal Government, moreover, was misconstruing the Council's quorum requirements; a quorum had been pres- ent at the session in question. Most importantly, the City Council held fast to its position that patent recommendations would be granted only to those Jews whose "public repu- tation" was favorable and denied to all others, whether or not there were specific or proven offenses.68 The Council was clearly tired of hearing itself accused of arbitrariness and of having its professionalism impugned, assert- ing, "One must trust the integrity of the Council not to deny a patent with- out reason." Since there was nothing wrong, in its opinion, with the rejected Judenpatent recommendations for 1821, the Council declared them valid- and blithely proceeded to forward First Division its patent recommenda- tions for 1822. Given the gravity of the Council's provocation, First Division was remarkably restrained, limiting itself to some insults, a vague threat of 65.

The Council had twenty-six members and there were approximately thirty-five Jewish applicants for patents. 68. Indeed, henceforth, the Council dispensed with the three-class patenting system, granting testimonials simply to those who "have practiced neither usury nor other unlawful business, at least insofar as the City Council has learned nothing to the contrary," denying them to those who "have not won the trust of general opinion to have refrained from all usurious commerce." Additional reasons for denial, such as not belonging to the Jewish community, or having recently immigrated and not yet established a business reputation, were sometimes also cited.</page><page sequence="26">82 SHULAMIT S. MAGNUS "unpleasant proceedings" if the city continued refractory, and a point-by- point rebuttal of the Council's position.69 Upholding its nullification of the Council's proceedings, it again ordered deliberation of the patents for 1821 (this, in the spring of 1822), as well as a new and "lawful" deliberation on the patents for the current year. It reiterated its rejection of patent denials based on grounds other than usury or not substantiated. The government, it insisted, would not accept judgments based on mere "rumor or on general opinion" (emphasis in the original). But the City Council did not relent, and began challenging the authority of First Division to oversee testimonial issuance. If ordered by "higher authorities," the Council said, it would prepare individual testimonials for each Jew, though this remained very objectionable. But it would not acquiesce to First Division's demand for hard evidence to substantiate denials.70 The 1808 decree had never placed such a burden on the munici- palities. On the contrary, the French law had presumed all Jews guilty of usury until proven otherwise. It was for the municipality to attest the appli- cant's innocence, not guilt, and this is what Cologne's Council had been doing."7 First Division's stance was dangerous as well as mistaken, more- over, since it would never be possible to prove a case against each Jew denied a testimonial. If First Division's ruling were implemented, every Jew who applied for a patent would receive one by default-and the Council, aided by the Chamber of Commerce, cited cases of patented Jews allegedly practicing usury and fraud to show the danger of such an outcome.72 The city, accordingly, would stand by its earlier resolutions on this subject. It also reaffirmed several denials of recommendations which First Division had specifically and repeatedly rejected. In response, First Division again rejected the Council's deliberations, repeating its demand for prompt new proceedings on the 1821 and 1822 patents, to be conducted according to all the bureau's rules-which, it insist- 69.

When prodded angrily for a response, the Council answered that it had been unable to gather the full quorum upon which First Division kept insisting. Should this number continue to be unattainable, might not First Division consider issuing patents according to the Council's previously for- warded recommendations?74 Temperatures rose on both sides; smoldering resentments flared. First Division heatedly reiterated its demands, setting new "intolerable" dead- lines, charging the Mayor's Office with a "special duty" to obey orders.75 These, however, the Council again rejected on the grounds that its proceed- ings, not those First Division had mandated, were more faithful to the injunctions of the 1808 law. As for First Division's concern that "rumors" might determine a Jew's fate, these were for Struensee, not the Council, to investigate, since-the familiar barb-the Council lacked police power.76 It was now early 1823 and an exasperated First Division decided to sidestep the Council. It issued patents for 1821, 1822, and 1823 according to its own judgment of the Jews' patent-worthiness, overruling many of the Council's denials and issuing patents to other Jews upon whom the Council had never pronounced.77 The Council, now headed by Mayor Steinberger, was incensed. It rejected First Division's instructions to deliberate patent testimonials for 1824 and announced its intention to seek a "higher judg- ment" about the entire matter.78 First Division fumed back that it was not the Council's business to question orders but to execute them dutifully. How dare it presume to challenge First Division's instructions, which, the Coun- cil had already been told, issued from the Ministry of Interior?79 No one in the Council doubted the correctness of its stance on Juden- patente.

MAGNUS ed the Council to the legendary professional loyalty of the Prussian bureaucracy, allowing it even to dream that the Ministry of Interior might overrule one of its own bureaus in the Council's favor.s0 Doubts did arise about the wisdom of refusing to deliberate patent testimonials for 1825, and, by this time, for 1826 as well, while the appeal was processed. The Council was split 11 to 10 between extremists who considered further dealings with First Division an "utter waste of time," and moderates, including Stein- berger, who here exercised his right to vote, arguing that it was the Council's legal obligation to deliberate testimonial issuance while awaiting the verdict from Berlin.8' The moderates lost, setting the stage for the final act of the long dispute. News of the Council's vote was received at First Division with cold fury. The time had come to break the errant Council. It informed Steinberger: We have learned to our great displeasure from your report of December 31 and its appendix that the majority of the members of the present City Council have refused to deliberate the legally mandated testimonials for the Jews of this city for the purpose of drawing up the trading patents these latter have sought for 1825 and 1826. We order you to immediately gather the entire Council at another time; to inform the latter once again of the contents of our instructions of January 24, 1824, and to enjoin the latter at the same time that since the City Council is legally bound to [hold] the deliberation in question, further refusal will consti- tute the crime of insubordination and will necessitate [the appropriate] investi- gation.

See draft and final copy of the Council session of December 17, 1824. The original count was eleven in favor of not deliberating patents (that is, of disobeying orders), and nine who counseled the more conservative course. The latter number, however, was switched from "neun" to "zehn" and the following margin notation appended: "Since the Mayor is also a [Council] member, twenty-one [members] were therefore present." Thus, while Mayor Stein- berger was among the more level-headed on the Council, he nevertheless participated directly in an act of insubordination to Prussian provincial authorities.</page><page sequence="29">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 85 entire Council is present at this deliberation and that no member lacking legal grounds to be excused shall be missing from it.82 Several weeks later, the eagerly awaited response from the Ministry of Interior arrived, and it upheld First Division. Any procedures that office had ordered, it said, originated in Berlin and completely accorded with the "spirit" of the 1808 decree. The Ministry would entertain no appeals. The City Council was to execute patent proceedings exactly as directed.83 Amazingly enough, even this was not the end of it. The Council met in full strength as ordered, and did deliberate Judenpatente testimonials for 1824 and 1825.84 But it again rejected the demand for specifics, much less proof of wrongdoing, in cases of testimonial denial. The 1808 legislation was discriminatory, it insisted. The Prussians were trying to make it fair. If proof were required of a Jewish trader's wrongdoing, how, it asked in bewilder- ment, would the treatment accorded a Jew differ from that accorded a non-Jew? It was for the business community-"public opinion"-to decide a Jew's worthiness for membership; for this community to lift the suspicion of general Jewish guilt from an individual's shoulders, or not. The Council would follow this verdict. The Council could not fulfill its role in the patent- ing process in the manner demanded by the government.85 Indeed, when in subsequent years the Council withheld patent recom- mendations, it was because "public opinion" was negative and the Council was "not convinced that [the Jew] had never been guilty of any usury."86 Undoubtedly because of Prussian pressure, the Council did go to some lengths to obtain intelligence about applicants; its records after the 1825 "showdown" are replete with detailed police reports about individual Jews. These were almost always favorable, and, together with vigilant Prussian prodding, resulted in the reversal of most of the Council's denials. The 82. First Division to Steinberger, January 15, 1825.

MAGNUS notably diminished role of the Chamber of Commerce in the Council's patent deliberations of 1822-the result, in all likelihood, of extreme tension between the two bodies at this point-may also have been a factor in the reversals." But the Council never conceded its right to truly judge Jewish worthiness for patents, not merely rubber stamp the verdicts of the Prussian officials. Several years after the "showdown" between the Council and First Divi- sion, reverberations of this fundamentally opposing view of the city's governing capacities continued. In May 1828, the Council denied its recom- mendation to a Jew who had the Ministry of Interior's permission to settle in Cologne as a merchant. It even urged the man's deportation because he had recently sold his belongings at auction to pay his debts, and the city feared he was about to become a public charge.88 First Division, in one of its most explicit pronouncements on the subject, bluntly informed Mayor Steinberger that "it is not for the City Council to decide questions of citizen- ship in general," nor had the 1808 decree given it such jurisdiction over immigrating Jews: article 16 was the exclusive domain of the state. The only pronouncement the city was entitled to make about a Jew was with regard to usury, to which question exclusively it was to direct its attention in the case at hand.89 87. This conclusion is based on the abundance of material from the local police and the paucity of correspondence with the Chamber of Commerce on the "morality" and patent- worthiness of Jews. The hostility between the Council and the Chamber is evidenced in the Council's Judenpatente records. In May 1828, the Chamber recommended denying a patent to a Jew against whom it had no negative information, but whose business was so insignificant that he had not even paid the minimum trade tax (Gewerbesteuer); the Jew, it said, should be asked to show proof of having paid this tax before being granted the Council's recommenda- tion. Steinberger, who was then embroiled in a bitter turf conflict with the Chamber, remarked to the Council in his notes about the case that matters of Gewerbesteuer were to be left to the appropriate authorities-in short, that this was none of the Chamber's business. The Council granted the Jew in question, M. J. Cahen, an endorsement. 88. Mayor Steinberger to First Division, May 9, 1828. 89. First Division to Mayor Steinberger, June 3, 1828. The Council held in abeyance its decision on the Jew, Mendel Lehman, while it solicited the recommendation of the authorities in his previous place of residence. Apparently this was satisfactory, since the Council quietly granted the man a patent in November 1828. See Mayor Steinberger's memorandum to the Council, undated, entitled "Zum Stadtrath," following Chamber of Commerce to Mayor, May 14, 1828; Council to First Division, June 18, 1828; Council session, November 12, 1818; Stein- berger to First Division, November 15, 1828.</page><page sequence="31">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 87 Jewish Responses From the beginning, Jews denied the Council's endorsement appealed the decisions to the Council, the local police, or the Prussian authorities- Police President Struensee or First Division. While Jews denied endorse- ment are prominent among the "transients" of the Jewish population who disappear from the records, most remained in the city, reapplied each year for patenting, and vigorously appealed their rejections in the meanwhile. There is no evidence that the consistorial synagogue in Bonn or the local synagogue in Cologne ever protested the Council's behavior to the Prussians or appealed denials in individual cases. The Consistory played its legally mandated role, issuing the character references required for patents. As far as we can tell, it did so in virtually every case, and its endorsement some- times factored in the reversal of negative Council decisions.90 But there was no institutional Jewish response to the Council's enforcement of the 1808 law, nor to the basic inequity of the law itself. The behavior of Jews denied patents-their tenacity in pursuing vindica- tion, the language they used when doing so-is the more noteworthy for being individual and undirected. Their petitions, preserved among the records of the City Council, are virtually the only materials in which Cologne's Jews speak in their own voice. That voice is remarkably forth- right, even adamant. It was also not without effect. The most persistent Jewish plaintiffs eventually won patents. Moreover, the abuses they report- ed heightened Prussian awareness of the potential economic cost of the city's Judenpatent policy and, arguably, even sensitized the Prussians to the human predicament of Jews living under the 1808 law. Jews denied patents because of a negative City Council recommendation protested those verdicts from the outset. While unpatented Jews continued to live and work in the city, their business agreements and loans lacked legal 90. Reports of the Consistory's actions, the number of character references it issued, appear occasionally in Prussian or city communications. The Consistory issued highly favorable recommendations to two Jews, Moises Pollack and Salomon Lejonge, who were denied patents; Police President to von Mylius, September 27, 1817. On the strength of the Consis- tory's endorsement, First Division challenged the Council's denial of its recommendation to one Isaac Waller, who had persistently pressed the government for a patent. See City Council session, January 16, 1818. The Council denied Waller anyway, on the grounds that he had immigrated and had not been patented previously.</page><page sequence="32">88 SHULAMIT S. MAGNUS standing and they could not do wholesale business. A Prussian ordinance even threatened them with arrest.9' Given the stakes and the loose manner in which the Council withheld recommendations, it is not surprising that Jews denied patents appealed the decisions. One can imagine, for instance, the horror of one Alexander Oppenheim at the predicament in which he found himself. About to be married, Oppenheim was in the process of leaving a job as an employee of a Jewish firm to go into business for himself when he was denied a patent sole- ly because he had had the bad judgment to declare himself an "old clothes' dealer." Oppenheim spent years trying to have himself reclassified in a more respectable occupational category so that he might gain the Council's endorsement, but every time he tried, the Council came up with a new reason to deny him-including the fact that he had not previously been patented. Only after the showdown between the Council and First Division, when many Jews long denied patents finally obtained them, did Oppenheim succeed, ten years after his first application.92 91. Some unpatented Jews living in Cologne conducted their business elsewhere. See M. Pollack to First Division, August 13, 1818, in which Pollack states that he had lived in Cologne for years and "have supported myself through trade outside the city." Yet Pollack also claimed that he had been forbidden to travel because he lacked a patent. Apparently, Pollack worked on the left bank of the Rhine; presumably, unpatented Jews from the left bank could have con- ducted legitimate trade on the right bank of the river, where the 1808 decree was not in force. There are several petitions for patents from Jews no longer in business, who needed them in order to collect debts. See "Nachweisung der in hiesigen Stadt Wohnenden Israeliten, welche pro 1826 das Judenpatent verlangen" of December 5, 1825, entry no. 18, on Simon Cohen, "this old man, who has been unemployed since 1823 and from that point on has not been fur- nished a Judenpatent, nevertheless requests one since [the patent] is absolutely necessary in any court for collection of outstanding debts"; and the undated document entitled "Judenpatente pro 1827" (placed immediately before document dated February 3, 1827), regarding the Jew David Daniel, who had recently given up the butcher's trade and was, therefore, not on the list of those to be granted Judenpatente, yet who needed a patent in order to collect debts. Jews could not get the normal trading "concession" unless they had first obtained a Juden- patent. In addition, Jews had to pay the trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) required of all merchants. See Struensee to von Mylius, January 9, 1818; Joseph Hollender to Mayor's Office, February 25, 1818. The prohibition of Jews conducting business without a Judenpatent on pain of arrest, which the 1808 decree itself does not specify, can be found in the "Verordnungen" cited in note 53. 92. See the original police report on him, by Police Inspector Werner, April 30, 1817, upon which the first denial was based, and Oppenheim's instantaneous appeal, May 1, 1817. In April 1826, Oppenheim was granted a patent for 1824 and 1825 and was patented thereafter until his death in 1828; his widow, Therese, was then patented in his stead.</page><page sequence="33">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 89 Jews treated in such a fashion were indignant and gave expression to their emotions in their appeals. In the months before he was finally granted a patent in 1826, Alexander Oppenheim wrote to Mayor Steinberger, I hear that the Judenpatente for [this year] have been distributed without my being sent one. I ask therefore, most respectfully, that this mistake be rectified and that a testimonial of my morality for the years 1824 and 1825 as well as for the current year ... be sent to the Honorable Royal Government [First Divi- sion] most graciously, and in great haste [emphasis in the original], since I have come into the position of needing a [Judenpatent] most urgently.93 It should be noted that when Oppenheim appealed his first Judenpatent rejection in 1817, he was told by First Division, then quite hostile to Jews, to drop the matter, since "your request is hereby denied once and for all."94 The Jewish merchant's need for a special patent, which could be with- held on the flimsiest of hearsay, was exploited by non-Jewish competitors seeking the Jew's ruin. The ever-present possibility of such abuse was one of the law's chief liabilities.95 One Jew thus victimized wrote Mayor von Mylius: It pains me deeply and most earnestly that while my other co-religionists have received the Judenpatente they sought, such a patent was refused [emphasis in the original] to me, and indeed, because the present City Council has seen fit to deny me the legally mandated testimonial, alleging that I enjoy no good reputation. I have lived here in Cologne for more than ten years, appear on the popu- lation list, pay all the taxes of a Biirger and have a second-class [general busi- ness] patent. I am among those who had a Judenpatent already in French times, and I therefore find it absolutely impossible to remain silent about the Council's proceedings. I therefore request Your Honor, most humbly, to have the complaints on the basis of which the Council saw fit to deny me a testi- monial most graciously forwarded to me, so that I can vindicate myself as is right and proper.

The following year he was grant- ed the Council's recommendation, though only for a "second-class" Juden- patent, which, as we recall, was given to previously patented Jews who had given no cause to be denied patents yet had somehow fallen short of the Council's full endorsement. Perhaps the most striking example of the inequities and galling frustra- tions of the Judenpatent system was the case of one Moises Pollack, a Posen-born resident of Cologne since 1807 and by far the Jew city authori- ties most loved to hate. Pollack was either a notorious one-time thief or, more likely, the victim of a case of mistaken identity. A Jew by this name had been a member of a robber band of mixed Jewish/non-Jewish composi- tion which had operated in the Cologne vicinity in the late 1790s.97 Although there was some damning circumstantial evidence implicating the "Lob Moises Pollack" of the Judenpatente records, it is unlikely that the two were the same person.98 Lob Moises Pollack had not settled in Cologne until ten years after the thief Pollack participated in a daring raid on Cologne's customs house. According to Prussian records, Lob Moises Pollack had also been granted a Judenpatent by the French in 1813-just a few years after the French succeeded in curbing the depredations of the robber band. The only uncontested blot on Lob Moises' record was that he had been arrested shortly after the Prussian takeover on charges of theft. He had also, by everyone's account, been acquitted for lack of evidence. Pollack was nonetheless denied a Judenpatent by Cologne's City Council because of "his known association with thieves," a charge, were it true, which constituted letter-perfect grounds for patent denial under the 1808 law. Pollack, a peddler, appealed the decision to Police President Struensee 96. Letter received in the Mayor's Office on October 7, 1817. 97.

See the original police report on Pollack in Police Inspector Sch6nig to Mayor von Mylius, May 1, 1817, in which Sch6nig states that although Pollack denied charges of receiving stolen goods, he admitted knowing a man who was under arrest in Bonn on robbery charges.</page><page sequence="35">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 91 (again, hardly the behavior of a thief), bringing evidence of his court acquit- tal and other attestations of his good character. Struensee found it all rather compelling; the Council did not.99 Pollack, whose ability to earn a living was being imperiled for lack of a patent, turned to First Division. If you please, most humbly, to grant me a temporary Concession, since I have lived here for twelve years and make my living outside the city through the sale of goods. I need this Concession in order to ply my trade, which has been for- bidden me because of intelligence sent to the local police by the royal procura- tor in Bonn concerning receiving stolen silver, which authority, however, has written again to the local police to declare my innocence. Sustained by your understanding and knowledge that I am an oppressed, upright citizen, I hope that your most Honorable Government will allow your- self to feel my situation in your heart, [to feel] how necessary it is for me to be granted such a Concession as soon as possible so that I can discharge my duty as supporter to my wife and children, so that I can as quickly as possible be allowed to go on my travels, which has been forbidden me for a year already.'00 First Division ordered the Council to justify why it should not grant Pol- lack a recommendation in light of the evidence. Mayor von Mylius and the Council responded testily that their judgment was not "based only" upon the now-overturned original police report (they did not state on what grounds it was based), and that they saw no reason to change their minds.' 0 They did not-for over ten years. But in December 1827, at a point when the Council, probably at Prussian behest, was thoroughly investigating Jews to whom it wished to deny patents, Pollack's case-he had been applying for a patent annually since 1817-was reopened. On the page margin of a com- munication to First Division regarding patents for the following year, Stein- berger noted, "Pollack has been denied a Judenpatent till now because he was under suspicion of association with thieves. One wonders how he has behaved since then, and whether he has earned a Judenpatent through 99.

It read: "Moises Pollack has thus far conducted himself right well, has given not the slightest complaint, and through honorable, irreproachable conduct has earned claim to a Judenpatent."'03 Pollack was issued a Council testimonial on February 8, 1828, and a Judenpatent several weeks later. In the cover letter to First Division sent with the minutes of the Council's deliberations, Steinberger wrote blandly of the enclosure that it "concerned patents still to be granted various local Jews." After a decade of being typed a dire threat to the welfare of the com- munity-in 1817 First Division had excoriated the Council for even suffer- ing his presence in the city-Pollack's tenacity had finally paid off. He was just another Jew. Assessing the Conflict In his classic study of German hometowns, Mack Walker has written that "community . . . implied outsiders." Jews were not the only social out- siders on the German scene, but until full, legal emancipation was granted, and arguably, even afterwards, they were outsiders par excellence.,04 If ancient patterns of discrimination made it possible to consider Jews alien to "the community" in the south German localities Walker studies, where the Jewish presence was centuries old, we can only imagine how Jews must have appeared to the keepers of the communal gate in a place like Cologne. Still, we must ask if there was a broader context for the city's opposition to Jewish integration, a heightened sense of societal vulnerability or a crack- down against other "outsiders." Cologne did experience considerable immigration after the Prussian takeover, its population increasing 11 percent (from 49,000 to 55,000) 102. Steinberger to First Division, December 31, 1827. 103.

Unfortunate- ly, there is no known official reaction to the influx-which itself would seem to indicate that the immigration was not perceived as a problem and was not resisted.'06 This makes the near hysteria over the proportionately minuscule Jewish immigration-the dire warnings of the Chamber of Commerce about proliferating weeds-the more striking. It would be tempting to ascribe the restrictive positions of the city government and Chamber of Commerce on the Jews to the survival of "proud old Reichsstadt" traditions. Such an explanation could certainly apply to the City Council, whose members had long ties to the governmental order in Colone, and who in some cases were holdovers from the previous era.'07 But it is not possible to write off the behavior of the Chamber of Commerce as a mere throwback, the extended death rattle of an Old Order which refused to disappear. The Chamber was a quintessentially modern institution, created by the French, built on the ruins of the medieval guilds they abolished. While some of its members derived from Cologne's old elite and also served on the City Council, its most prominent figures were "new men": Protestants, immigrants, Catholics who had joined the Freemasons during the French era.'08 The Protestants themselves had enjoyed full civic 105.

MAGNUS rights in Catholic Cologne only since the coming of the French. They want- ed to exploit business opportunities and develop Cologne's mercantile posi- tion, not turn back to some mythical and, for them, dark period of ancient history. Peter Heinrich Merkens, for instance, one of the avowed leaders of the "liberal" faction in the Rhenish provincial diets from the 1820s on, was the Protestant son of a baker from Mulheim. Having achieved remarkable business success in Cologne-he started as an apprentice in a Protestant firm-and election to the Chamber of Commerce in 1810, Merkens utterly dominated the institution in the period in question.109 Yet Merkens signed many of the Chamber's most viciously anti-Jewish pronouncements."0 The label "liberal" is exceedingly problematic in this early period. It has been used in Merkens's case because of his efforts to win the middle class a voice in government and because he championed such innovative enter- prises as steam shipping."' Given his background, the man was, of course, "completely unburdened by remembrances of the Reichsstadt," for whose old families he had a pronounced distaste.12 Whenever Merkens's name is mentioned in secondary literature in connection with Jews, it is with refer- ence to his call in 1843 for their civic equality.'" But the Judenpatent records attest that in the teens and twenties Merkens was an implacable foe of Jews even settling in Cologne, much less having rights there. van Eyll, p. 73; Gothein, Stadt Coln, p. 190; Perlitz, Geld, Bank und Versicherungswesen, pp. 186-187, 326 ff.; and Barbara Becker-JAkli, Die Protestanten in Koln (Cologne, 1983), pp. 131 ff. 109.

Moreover, the two institutions were at bitter loggerheads in pre- cisely these years. Jewish policy was one of precious few areas in which the City Council and the Chamber of Commerce agreed, much less cooperated. What explains the common stance of Cologne's "reactionaries" and "pro- gressives" on the Jewish question? If not fully accounting for it, Cologne's economic circumstances help to situate this collaboration in a broader context. Economic conditions in the city ranged from severely depressed to unstable into the thirties. The teens and early twenties, when the Chamber and Council first articulated their anti-Jewish positions, were particularly dismal years. Of special significance was the monetary crisis, including a shortage of coin, which plagued the whole Rhine region. Under such conditions, interest rates rose and "wild rumors were thrown up everywhere about usurers.""'4 Given popular ster- eotype and the fact that 20 percent of Cologne's Jews practiced some form of moneylending, Jews could easily have loomed as a monstrous threat."5 The Chamber of Commerce and the City Council did accuse several Jews of exploiting conditions "particularly in this period when a general shortage of money has set in," victimizing in particular "poor people," "the lower classes and the petty seamen" through ruinous loan deals. One Jew was accused of circulating counterfeit foreign coins. Another was said to have "ruined many" poor families (fifteen or twenty complaints had been lodged against him). The Jew, having brought these people "to the abyss, then behaved with the greatest mercilessness, often grabbing their beds from under their bellies, his house being a regular depot of such and similar items."

MAGNUS of Commerce recommendations which deeply informed them establishes that, invective notwithstanding, it was the Jewish petty dealer (Klein- hdndler,) not the Jewish usurer (Wucherer,) who was the real target of the authorities."7 And it is here that specifically anti-Jewish animus and broad- er outlooks meet. For all their political rivalry, the City Council and the Chamber of Com- merce shared two basic traits. First, in a city with almost no industrial base, the members of both institutions were wealthy magnates who dominated the trading sector."8 Second, both the Council and the Chamber were highly exclusive clubs-only forty-three men served on the Chamber between 1815 and 1833, with the average term lasting over nine years-and both were determined to maintain that exclusivity.''19 The City Council lost much of its autonomy in this period, but did not undergo a challenge to its internal composition. The Chamber, on the other hand, twice underwent such a challenge, and its response in both instances is of direct relevance to our concerns. In 1820, Prussia, having promulgated a new business tax, attempted to increase the number of businessmen eligible for it. This would have had the effect of broadening the category of "first-class" merchants who, among their "merchants' rights," also possessed the right to vote in Chamber of Commerce elections.120 The Chamber, led by Peter Heinrich Merkens, 117. In 1828, for example, Merkens and two other Chamber of Commerce members recom- mended denying a Judenpatent to a Jew who, by their own admission, had practiced no usury or other illegal commerce, merely because the size of the Jew's business had not warranted a 30-taler trade tax assessment. See Chamber of Commerce to City, May 14, 1828, regarding M. J. Cahen. Such a requirement was blatantly discriminatory, since only 27 percent of Cologne merchants assessed Gewerbesteuer in 1822 paid 30-47 taler; 60 percent paid between 12 and 30 taler.

In the absence of a significant manufacturing sector, there was no split between indus- trialists and merchants over trade and tariff policy, such as existed in other Rhenish cities and would later develop in Cologne.

Once again, Cologne's Chamber balked. Members elected under the new rules refused to take office, while Merkens, his own humble origins notwithstanding, led the charge against the reforms. 22 In both 1820 and 1832 Merkens's argument was the same: the Chamber of Commerce was the proper preserve of a truly "first class" of businessmen, composed, that is, of representatives of old, established, and prosperous firms. The line between notables and "nonentities"-minor merchants- must not be effaced. What the government was proposing was not only unjust, since those paying higher taxes rightfully should have more say in fashioning public policy. It was perverse. If the government had its way, Merkens warned, "petty restaurateurs, artisans, fruit peddlers, dealers in second-hand goods, harpists, organists," would sit alongside bankers, great merchants, and manufacturers in representing the concerns of business before government. 23 Merkens resigned for a time from the Chamber, so insistent was he on the preservation of the exclusivity of the established business elite. 124 This was the Chamber's stand for control of Biirgeraufnahme-the acceptance of "outsiders" as members of (its) society-and it is in this context that the city's struggle against Jews, a parallel Biirgeraufnahme dis- pute, must be placed. The generally restrictionist mentality of Cologne's business elite, as well as the more inclusive outlook of the Prussian authori- ties, carried over with regard to the Jews. Recall the assignment of Jews 121. On this affair, see Schwann, Geschichte der K6lner Handelskammer, pp. 424 ff., Kellen- benz, and van Eyll, Geschichte der Unternehmerische Selbstverwaltung, pp. 87-88, and Diefen- dorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, pp. 291 ff. 122.

MAGNUS practicing petty trades to a fabricated "second-class" Judenpatent category, the blithe denial of recommendations to Jews whose only misdeed was old- clothes dealing-indeed, the city's entire policy of concocting pretexts for barring Jews from obtaining Judenpatente, as well as the Prussians' policy of granting them.'25 Cologne's business elite was tiny-a mere 171 men in the entire city pos- sessed first-class merchants' rights in 1821, according to the Chamber's count. It was, then, exceedingly vulnerable to the dilution of its political influence through expansion of its ranks. Precisely such dilution, according to Jeffrey Diefendorf, was a prime goal of Prussian policy and explains why Merkens, himself an arriviste, fought so hard against newcomers.126 The Jewish policy of Cologne's merchant elite, then, was in accord with their broader policies and strategies. It is certainly unsurprising that a general defense of privilege by "insiders" against "outsiders" would be coupled with an extreme anti-Jewish posture. If, as I think was the case, the Chamber believed its own rhetoric about hordes of Jews poised to overrun Cologne, the Prussian policy of granting Judenpatente liberally-elevating the Jewish hordes to the rank and privileges of the Kaufmannschaft-must have been terrifying.127 125. A Judenpatent was an all-or-nothing business license, while merchants in general were divided into three categories according to the scale of their business and the trade tax paid, with licenses and rights granted accordingly; "class A" merchants had the right to vote in elections to the Chamber of Commerce. See Ayqoberry, vol. 2 appendices 9 and 10, pp. 47-48, 57. Although Jews were also required to pay the trade tax and were, therefore, subject to the same division into merchant categories, the Chamber of Commerce, apparently, was irked by the "classlessness" of the Judenpatent. This, it would seem, was what motivated the Chamber's manufacture of a first and second class of Judenpatente, which, as we recall, the Council adopted. See, too Chamber to City, May 14, 1828, regarding the Jew M. J. Cahen. On the requirement of Jews granted Judenpatente to pay the Gewerbesteuer, see HASK 400-11-16, 1, "Vertheilung der Gewerbesteuer," Royal Police President and Landrat Struensee to Mayor's Office, December 14, 1822, and ff. 126. Diefendorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, pp. 292, 303. 127. The tactics, even the language, which the city authorities in Cologne and the Prussians used in their fight over Jewish status are strikingly similar to those employed by embattled elites and encroaching state bureaucracies elsewhere in Germany regarding other "outsiders." When the state governments in Hesse and Bavaria challenged the control of old economic elites, the elites began to insist on their right to reject newcomers of "bad reputation." The term, legally undefined, generally connoted sexual promiscuity; in the economic realm, it signified laziness or predictable business failure-including failure precipitated by the new environment's own hostility. In response to this tactic, Mack Walker shows, the state governments of Hesse and Bavaria (and, we would add, Prussia) demanded that "bad reputation" be legally defined "as</page><page sequence="43">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 99 One noteworthy event bolsters the thesis that official resistance to Jews was tied to the business elite's revulsion at the prospect of sharing power with "nonentities." In 1822, in the midst of virulent anti-Jewish lobbying, Cologne's Chamber of Commerce elected the Jewish banker, Salomon Oppenheim, Jr., to membership. Regrettably, although the histories of Cologne, the Chamber of Commerce, Cologne Jewry, and the Oppenheim house all note Oppenheim's election, some hailing it as proof of the city's progress toward tolerance,128 none explore its circumstances, and we can only hypothesize the apparent: Oppenheim's money compensated for his religion. The Oppenheim house had moved into the ranks of Cologne's largest banks within a few years of Salomon Oppenheim's move to the city in 1798. It was involved in the full course of financial activities alongside the respected and politically powerful Catholic and Protestant houses of Cologne. In fact, Oppenheim's election to the Chamber of Commerce merely capped his acceptance into Cologne's financial elite.129 Given the influence Oppenheim already wielded, it would have been remarkable had he not gained entry into the body representing the city's business elite. In accepting the Jewish magnate into its ranks while resisting business licenses for petty Jewish traders, the Chamber was being true to its larger biases, and truer to the spirit of the 1808 decree, which penalized petty trade but favored large- scale enterprise, than were the Prussians with their advocacy of middle-level and petty merchants.'30 Was, then, the anti-Jewish stance of the City Council and Chamber of specific actions, identified and judicially condemned by state courts. What other ... criteria could there be for an idea like bad reputation?" Yet, as Walker writes, "The hometowns-men knew: a person's reputation is bad when the town council and the community deputies agree that it is." Walker, German Home Towns, p. 303.

MAGNUS Commerce simply synonymous with a plutocratic defense of power; Prus- sian liberalism, merely an extension of a larger policy of attacking and undermining that same power bastion? Were both anti-Semitism and philo- Semitism, in short, but an expression of something else? Taking the city first, analysis of the behavior of the City Council and the Chamber of Commerce shows that a distinct Jewish policy did exist, because the positions of both bodies on the Jewish issue differed significantly from those they took in the dispute over membership in the merchant elite. Whereas the Mayor's Office, under both the deputies and Steinberger, co- operated with the state government against the Chamber of Commerce in the membership conflict, the City Council and the Chamber collaborated closely against the Prussians on Jewish policy.'3' If, we reason, the city government shared the Prussian desire to see the power of the Chamber of Commerce diluted through expansion of its ranks, its antipathy to Jews was such that it would not consent to using them as tools even in this noble cause. Wealth, moreover, while generally aiding the case of Jews applying for Council testimonials, did not guarantee favorable treatment; witness the Council's stubborn denial of a testimonial to a well-established, previously patented Jewish merchant from Munster, first on grounds that he was not a member of the local synagogue, then because he was a foreigner.132 If economic considerations alone had governed the Council's Jewish policy, we should expect it to have done what the Prussians did in this and other cases where Jews were economically attractive: skirted the 1808 legis- 131. On the city government's assistance to the Prussian authorities against the Chamber of Commerce on the franchise issue, see Diefendorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, pp. 292 ff. 132. The Jew in question was Ezechiel Ritter, denied the Council's testimonial on Novem- ber 28, 1821 and November 3, 1822, finally granted one following Prussian pressure on October 31, 1823. I deduce Ritter's secure financial standing from his stated address on one of the city's better streets (Jewish population list, June 9, 1821), from the relatively high Cultus Kosten con- tribution he was assessed by the Jewish community in 1825-26, and from the fact and nature of the business advertisement he placed in the Ki1nische Zeitung of January 6, 1821 (the latter is preserved among the Judenpatent records, which testifies to the significance municipal authori- ties placed on it). Miller, Geschichte der Juden in Kbln, p. 48, is incorrect in asserting that the Council's deci- sions on Judenpatente were a function of the wealth of the individual applicant.</page><page sequence="45">JEWS IN PRUSSIAN COLOGNE, 1815-1828 101 lation and facilitated Judenpatent issuance.'3 On the contrary. The Council not only shared the Chamber's loathing for Jewish petty trade, it apparently harbored an opposing fear: the fear of Jewish success and competition. Mayor von Mylius expressed it best in 1819 when he quoted to First Divi- sion from some scurrilous tracts purporting to tell the history of the Jews in Germany: "as soon as a German city blossomed in the Middle Ages, it re- stricted or eliminated the Jews, who had gradually drawn all commercial transactions to themselves."'34 Jews, in short, would either subvert trade or monopolize it. Their economic activities, petty or grand, below or above board, were a menace to non-Jewish society simply because they were prac- ticed by Jews. No wonder the unavoidable Oppenheim was never held up, Mendelssohn-like, as an example of what the Jews in Cologne could become. The exception, Cologne's government hoped, would not become the rule. As we know, the city was willing to tolerate a small Jewish community, above all, one of its own choosing. It did not press for a return to the status quo ante, the total exclusion of Jews from the city and its economic life, but was content with the discriminatory 1808 decree-as long as execution was in city hands. This shows that the Council, for all its fear of Jews, did see some economic usefulness in a small, restricted Jewish presence. Paradoxi- cally, though, the fact that the City Council did not deny a much greater percentage of testimonial requests also illustrates the genuineness of the anti-Jewish prejudice: Jews were not simply being used to thwart Prussian intervention. Faced with the Jews who actually applied for patents in Cologne, with police and Chamber of Commerce attestations of upstanding, biurgerlich behavior in almost all cases, the Council granted the majority of endorsement requests. But all the evidence did not allay its fundamental Judeophobia, the suspicion that good behavior by Jews was exceptional; 133. See Minister of Interior von Schuckmann to First Division, November 8, 1820; In- terior Ministry to J. Eschrott (Aschrott), April 15, 1820, granting him an exemption from arti- cle 16; City Council sessions, May 19, 1820 and July 20, 1820; Chamber of Commerce to Mayor's Office, August 11, 1821, bemoaning the fact that the Prussians had granted Aschrott a patent despite the Council's denial of its endorsement. 134.

In one instance, the Chamber of Commerce, in recommending a Jew for the Council's testimonial, lamented that the man's blameless con- duct had left it no other choice.'35 Consistency is not a hallmark of prejudiced thinking. The disparity between rhetoric and record in city Judenpatent policy is evidence not of dis- ingenuousness in the service of strategy, but of a deeply conflicted mentality in which Jews were both a lethal threat and, if controlled in numbers and behavior, economically useful. The crucial point was control. The attitude of the Prussian authorities to the Jews was utilitarian, based on economic considerations. In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, John Gillis writes, Prussian officials, "trained in laissez-faire economics," were staunch advocates of "economic emancipation."'36 This was certainly true of provincial officials on the Rhine. First Division, which began with an extremely anti-Jewish stance, quickly changed its attitude because of financial considerations. The reason for this shift is nowhere spelled out, but it can be surmised from an exchange of letters between First Division and Mayor von Mylius in 1819. When the French abolished the Holy Roman Empire, and with it the electoral state of Cologne (in the midst of which the city of Cologne sat as an autonomous entity), the corporate Jewry (Judenschaft) of the territory owed the electoral treasury a considerable amount of money. Prussia, determined to collect that debt, set up a commission to apportion it among the Jewish communities of the former electorate."'37 Since there had been no Jewish community in the city of Cologne until French times, the Prussians had to find a means to include the newly established community in the assessment. First Division was assigned the task, and in a stiff, rudely worded letter to von Mylius, attempted to build a case whereby the city's Jews might be counted a constituent of the pre-French Judenschaft.'38 135.

No medieval Jewry privilege could be construed to include them. Facts notwithstanding, the Prussians counted the Jews of Cologne as members of the electoral Judenschaft and assessed them a special tax for the retirement of its debt. To financially pressed provincial authorities, no possi- ble revenue source could be ignored. With such an outlook, the activities and potential contributions even of petty Jewish entrepreneurs were wel- come-and, as we have seen, the Prussians by no means championed the cases only of wealthy Jews.'40 First Division's Jewish policy was in accord with that of the Interior Ministry, which generally championed the needs of "lesser but rising businessmen" against Merkens's exclusivity.41 Berlin created and First Division executed an exemption from article 16 of the 1808 decree for Jewish immigrants because of an economic philosophy which valued the contributions of smaller Jewish merchants. This desire to encourage trade at any level violated the values and per- ceived immunities of Cologne's business and governing elite, but the Prus- sians did not construct their Jewish policy in order to have this effect. Had they been using Jews merely as tools to undermine the city's pretensions to autonomy, they would have approved Jewish immigration and patent appli- cations indiscriminately. Yet analysis of the entire Prussian record on such applications shows that their liberality on the Jewish question was not abso- lute and indiscriminate; First Division did deem some Jews ineligible for patents. 42 Financial need and economic pragmatism made the Prussians the best friends of the largely lower-middle-class Jews of Cologne, even engender- ing, it seems, some appreciation of the humiliation and loss which Jews denied patents experienced.

MAGNUS Office of its concern that "harshness and injustice" were too likely to influence Judenpatent proceedings if mere rumors were admitted as evidence against a Jew.143 In another case, the Prussians ordered the Council to judge patent-worthiness strictly according to the stipulations of article 7 of the decree and urged speedy action so that the Jew involved, who was recently arrived (and albeit, happened to have "extremely good attestations of his means"), might "no longer be left in uncertainty" regarding his fate.144 The struggle over Biirgeraufnahme of Jews in Prussian Cologne touched on vital concerns for all the principals. For the Jews of this period, as for their coreligionists in the medieval era, the best hope lay with the higher authorities, a reality they grasped quickly and exploited to good effect. If, perhaps, the long political history of the Jews of Europe helped those of Cologne assess their situation, it was just the opposite for the city authori- ties: centuries of zealously guarded independence ill prepared the city for modern realities. The French absorption was clearly taken as aberration, not portent; better was expected when the city returned to a German realm. But unlike newly absorbed localities in other German states, Prussian Cologne experienced only a progressive tightening of the leash. Prussia was not Bavaria; Frederick William did not need to appease Cologne with even a partial restoration of home rule in order to keep a political hold on it. Prus- sia did not yield to Cologne on any issue of policy, and treated the Jewish question no differently. Of course, Cologne's municipal government had no way of knowing that Prussia would prove so intractable, but its idee fixe about restoring the old Reichsstadt did not facilitate the dawning of wisdom. The resources of the governmental protagonists were far from equal, and with hindsight, the outcome appears inevitable. Yet in the end, Prussian authority was unable to bring an extraordinarily determined City Council entirely to heel. Although the city lost the war for control of Jewish affairs, it managed, with its unrelenting recalcitrance, to wear down the Prussians about a point central to the dispute from its inception: the kind and degree of substantiation necessary to deny testimonials. Even after the 1825 show- down, the city continued to deny its endorsement on the basis of a Jew's allegedly bad reputation and on grounds other than usury.145 All the Prus- 143.

The Prussians won in fact, and what the Council had predicted did come to pass after 1826: virtually all Jews who applied for patents received them without further ado. But the Council, vanquished, was not utterly defeated. Not just the outcome, but the fact of the dispute and the way in which it was waged, is significant. Cologne's assertiveness in defense of its economic agenda was without parallel on the Rhine.'47 Its battle with the state author- ities over the Jewish question was also singular: no other city in the Prussian Rhine Province mounted the kind of challenge for control of Jewish affairs which Cologne did.148 If Cologne's economic offensive was pressed by the Chamber of Commerce, its political offensive-the fight for control of Jewish status-was pressed by the city government, including the mayor, who was a Prussian civil servant. Such was the potency of Jews as a symbol of sovereignty. The long era of Jewish emancipation in Germany was marked by many struggles, on many levels of society and consciousness. The battle over Jews in Cologne was one facet of the greater struggle. Stanford University Stanford, Ca. 146. The tone of Mayor's Office communications after 1825 was markedly different from those of previous years. Judenpatent applications were thoroughly investigated, but usually recommended to the Council for positive action. Steinberger followed Prussian directives, but see his stance on the case cited above, n. 88 and 89. 147. Diefendorf, Businessmen and Politics in the Rhineland, illustrates this abundantly. 148. Cologne's stance might be attributable, in part, to the newness of the Jewish settlement there. Towns like Bonn and cities like Aachen and Mainz had had (ghettoized) Jewish popula- tions prior to the advent of the French and may have been less ruffled by the participation of Jews in economic life. Aachen, like Cologne, had been an autonomous free city until the French, yet there was nothing there like the resistance to Jews manifested by official Cologne. Liibeck, on the other hand, which had also been a freie Reichsstadt, but which had allowed no Jewish settlement prior to the French, re-expelled Jews when it regained autonomy after 1814.</page></plain_text>
