<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guy H. Haskell. From Sofia to Jaffa: The Jews ofBulgaria and Israel. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1994. 235 pp. The Jews of Bulgaria are relatively unknown to contemporary scholars. During the medieval period they did not contribute to the bibliography of Jewish scholarship; moreover, they were in the orbit of Byzantine Jewry. Hence they have been neglected by modem scholars. Similarly, during the Ottoman centuries only merchants appear in the limited responsa literature that touches the Sephardi community of the fertile plains of the Danube and the Black Sea entrepots. Hence they have been neglected by modem scholars. Their attempts to modemize were overshadowed by those of the Central and East European intellectuals and masses, neither of which could be matched by the smaller and less well educated Bulgarians. Hence they have been neglected. Finally, their mass aliyah after 1948 was swallowed up in the great oriental migration that changed forever the Ashkenazi-dominated demography of modem Israel. For that reason too they have been neglected by modem scholars. Indeed, Guy Haskell's useful little bibliography suggests that, save for scholars and laymen of Bulgarian extraction, too few of our contemporary maskilim have bothered to structure or elicit sources for a history of Bulgarian Jewry. And except for a handful of solid monographs limited to specific periods and topics, e.g., the Shoah, there are great gaps in the story of Bulgarian Jewry, a story that goes back to Roman times and wanders through the romantic sex-and-violence interludes of medieval ethnic invasions where dilettantes have hitherto dared to tread. It is as much for his survey of the whole period as for his detailed scholarship in certain areas, on the other hand, that Haim Kochales won a prize for his four-volume Korot Yehudei Bulgariyah (Tel Aviv, 1971-73). Guy Haskel has produced for English readers a useful little book whose three major divisions each deserve a separate critique. The author is a folklorist trained at Indiana University. He identifies himself as a scion of Bulgarian</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 433 Jews, and hence this book should be considered as a quest for identity, which may explain some of its eccentricities. Thus in part I he critiques the social science establishment in Israel, especially against the background of its "salvage scholarship" of the 1950s. Faced with a deluge of ancient and untainted cultures from the length and breadth of the Middle East, Israeli social scientists marshaled their forces to document the newcomers' folklore, languages, songs and dances, oral history, etc., at the same time as the Zionist forgers of the birthing state attempted to Ashkenize these wayward tribes of Israel. Historians and social scientists are well aware of the consequences of the "pressure cooker" approach. American Jews, on the other hand, have looked with pride at the way Israel overcame the vicissitudes of the "melting pot" experience of the masses in their country. Haskell gives an informative overview of the successes and failures of the Israeli social science approach to the ephemeral genizah of the oriental aliyah. He comes to the sad conclusion that what is lacking from their approach and from his discipline of folklore in general is an historical component. Perhaps "perspective" might be a better term, but the author clearly designates "historical" as a necessary supplement to folklore and ethnology, as if the ethnographer Herodotus had never been called "the father of history." Having introduced this hiddush into an otherwise imperialistic Weltanschauung, i.e., folklore as the most sophisticated eclectic approach to the study of culture, Haskell then proceeds to test his thesis in part II. Here he gives the English-reading audience a "history" of Bulgarian Jewry. History is in the mouth of the relator. This section of the book is clearly Haskell's story, and it probably would not run more than an opening night on off-off-Broadway. First of all, the author is not formally or self-trained as an historian, and he has little familiarity with the few sources or with the scholarship on which others have attempted the tale. Moreover, he does not evince the healthy criticism that is so basic a component of the historical method to the limited and biased sources we have. And finally, he does not have a perspective on the predominating patterns that affected Bulgarian Jewry through the ages. In other words, it is slightly presumptuous to write a history of two millennia in fifty-five pages and to pontificate on insoluble historical questions without recourse to the documents that raise these very questions. We are grateful to Haskell for his attempt, however; it shows us what is not known or understood outside a small group of specialists. Clearly a useful overview of Bulgarian Jewry is a desideratum. More important, the</page><page sequence="3">434 BOOK REVIEWS author shows us the limits of his discipline, of which he is a competent and recognized practitioner, in applying itself to questions of the past. Here his clarion call to study history in order to strengthen folklore is a welcome one and should be pursued both on the undergraduate and the professional level in a mutually respectful way. The annual conference of the Association for Jewish Studies is a good medium to initiate these discussions. I suspect we should all benefit from such interaction. After all, a previous generation melded history and sociology to produce seminal studies. In part III of his eclectic book, Haskell shows us his mettle as a folklorist practicing his craft. There he does a serious analysis, replete with inter- views and background research, of the immigration and acculturation of the Bulgarian Jewish community in Israel. His argument is that it is a unique community. Of all the great postwar immigration of the 1950s, only one group was primarily urban and remained so insofar as its integration into Israeli society was concerned: that was the Bulgarians. Already this community had been trained to Zionism for a generation if not two. That is, Zionism, as a specific form of nationalism for Jews, developed in tandem with and not in opposition to modem Bulgarian nationalism. Thus, the community was able to leave intact, arrive intact, settle in Jaffa and Bat Yam intact, and retain its integrity as an urban group without suffering culture shock as did oriental Jews. The author hints that it may have helped their cultural sanity that they were not studied by Israeli social scientists. The book is a welcome addition to an area which has seen little study, the Jewries of the Balkans. Further research hopefully will elucidate the hinterland of the Sephardi diaspora in the Balkans and its dissolution in the mid-twentieth century whether by death (Yugoslavia and Greece) or by emigration (Bulgaria and Albania).
