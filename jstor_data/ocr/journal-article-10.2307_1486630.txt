<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. P. Sanders. Judaism: Practice and Belief 63 BCE-66 CE. London: SCM Press, 1992. xix, 580 pp. E. P. Sanders regards this new work as a personal rethinking of approaches to first-century Judaism, an attack on and revision of "the prevailing view" in scholarly opinion of the last two centuries, which "suppressed the most natural interpretation of some of the evidence" (p. x). His view is that there was a common Judaism observed by the majority of the people, who were not affiliated with sectarian groups. This common religion, along with the internal social and political life of Judea, was not dominated by the Pharisees, as a careful and critical reading of Josephus and the rabbinic sources demonstrates. Josephus' account of the Pharisees varied between War and Antiquities, and Josephus' summaries about the Pharisees' popularity are not borne out by his account of specific events. The Mishnah, a creation of the second century, is not an infallible source for first-century religious practice. Sanders associates himself most closely with the school of Morton Smith, Jacob Neusner, Shaye Cohen, and Martin Goodman in this overall analysis (p. 535, n. 45, and passim). In truth, his book may be seen as a major expansion of the thesis in Smith's "Palestinian Judaism in the First Century," cited by Sanders in its 1977 reprint, but now already thirty-six years old since its original appearance (in M. Davis, ed., Israel: Its Role in Civilization [New York, 1956]). I had, perhaps naively, begun to think that its approach had indeed become the norm that this book now hopes to establish. Sanders acknowledges his debt, and,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 253 differing only on a few points with Smith and Neusner, provides extensive detail to fill in the picture of Judaism as it was practiced. He does so together with a repeated attack on the older views represented by E. SchUrer and J. Jeremias, and their more contemporary exponents, G. Alon, S. Safrai, A. Guttmann, and H. Maccoby. Much of Sanders's text is a manual of factual material discussed from a social-historical point of view, presented through the critical methods referred to above, and enhanced by the author's own illustrative scenarios. Topics include a full physical description of the Temple and the sacrificial cult, the work and income of the priests, taxes, religious observances from artifacts to holidays to purity regulations, the common theology and future hopes of the nation, daily life, and what is really known about the beliefs, practices, and social reality of the major sectarian groups. Several conclusions of Sanders's new views deserve notice: The people. In general the Jewish population supported the Temple worship and did observe biblical laws regarding tithes and purity. Common Judaism was essentially what the people and the priests agreed on. The Temple was a rallying point for the people, as was the Law; most were willing to die for it. They believed that God could and would intervene in history. These basically religious commitments outweighed economic factors as causes for protest and rebellion. The government. Roman taxation plus religious tithes and other exactions were not excessive, and the total was normal for the empire (usually under 28 percent). There was no steady buildup of tension that made the revolt inevitable, but alternating periods of tension and calm. The revolt itself came as a surprise. The term sanhedrin usually refers to an ad hoc court; there were no representative assemblies or legislative bodies in which the Pharisees or anybody else played an influential role. The priesthood and aristocracy. Priests, when not officiating in the Temple, provided public leadership as teachers and magistrates. The priests were not particularly corrupt; attacks on their integrity must be understood as the propaganda of their opponents. Similarly the leading aristocratic families were an upright and responsible group. Along with the "chief priests"--defined as members of the few families from which high priests were chosen-they provided national leadership within the context of Roman rule. Pharisees and Essenes. The first-century Pharisees did not believe that</page><page sequence="3">254 BOOK REVIEWS their "oral law" had actually originated with Moses. No major legal tradition is so described. For the pluralistic Essenes, of whom the Qumran sect is only one representative, the Damascus Covenant (CD) was the document of an extremist party that did not separate itself completely from the Temple, while the Community Rule (1QS) defined a fully separatist sect. Josephus. The more favorable attitude toward the Pharisees in Antiquities than in War is less due to the changed historical circumstances and post-revolt status of the Pharisees (Smith) than to the more liberal use of Nicholaus of Damascus in Antiquities. Because the Pharisees had at first supported Herod, Nicholaus was well disposed toward them. Sanders clearly wants a more sympathetic rendering of the Jews to emerge in a period for which Christian polemicists and the "older" academic views tended to depict a corrupt leadership and a society polarized between overly pious Pharisees and a non-observant population from whom the former separated themselves. He insists on the integrity of the priests and other leaders, minimizes the exclusivist legalism of the Pharisees, and upgrades the rank-and-file's basic piety and seriousness toward the Law. His positive description of the common Jewish religion, "covenantal nomism," with its goal of responding to the will of God, appears to be aimed at Christian readers. There are some important omissions, surprising in light of the Smith and Neusner citations. While the Pharisaic haburah is mentioned, there is no discussion of its initiatory system, and consequently its parallels with the Essenes. There is nothing about the Samaritans and the smaller sects of first-century Palestine. And there is little on the importance of hellenization among all Jewish subgroups or on popular practices such as magic. These might have been worth an additional chapter. The role of Christianity in first-century Judaism already has been explored by Sanders in his previous books. Stanley Isser State University of New York at Albany Albany, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
