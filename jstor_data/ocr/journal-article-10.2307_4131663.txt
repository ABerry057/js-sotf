<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 227-230 INTRODUCTION: AMERICAN JEWISH WRITING TODAY by Naomi Sokoloff This is an exciting time for North American Jewish literature. In the past ten years, there has been an explosion of writing by new and established authors. In the field of fiction alone, the shelves have filled with titles by such fine talent as Pearl Abraham, Melvin Jules Bukiet, Michael Chabon, Nathan Englander, Myla Goldberg, Ehud Havatzelet, Dara Hornm, Jonathan Safran Foer, Joan Leegant, Tova Mirvis, Jon Papemick, Jonathan Rosen, Aryeh Lev Stollman, and many others, as well as new works by veteran writers such as Allegra Goodman, Thane Rosenbaum, and Steve Stem. Add to these names the preeminent Cynthia Ozick, and don't forget Philip Roth, whose productivity continues unabated and whose latest novels include some of his strongest work ever.1 A variety of striking themes has come to the fore in this new wave of lit- erary creativity. Notable trends include an unprecedented attention to religion (especially Orthodox Jewish life); a fascination with women's lives and with questions of gender and sexual orientation; a concern with the experiences of the second and succeeding generations of the Holocaust; a nostalgia for and rediscovery of the old country; a consideration of new Americans in the 1980s and 1990s; and a rethinking of what it means to be a Jew in Israel and in the Diaspora. Perhaps nowhere is the energy of this moment more in evidence than in the venues of Nextbook, a national project that aims to bring books of Jewish interest to the public eye. This organization has arranged for a dazzling array of speakers, book signings, and cultural events in Chicago, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Activities have included a writers series offering presentations by major authors; readings and performances featuring new voices and new books; and lectures on history, culture, and ideas. Nextbook's Web site provides book reviews and recommendations, cultural news, links to resources at both the local and national levels, and information on organizing book groups.2 There never seems to be a dearth of new books or authors to publicize. 1. In addition to individual titles, a new crop of anthologies has appeared, offering both serious art and pop fiction. See, for example, Paul Zakrzewski, ed., Lost Tribes: Jewish Fiction from the Edge (New York: HarperCollins, 2003); and Lawrence W. Raphael, ed., Criminal Kabbalah: An Intriguing Anthology of Jewish Mystery and Detective Fiction (Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights, 2001). 2.

In the opening essay, Sara Horowitz takes as her point of departure the controversy that flared in 2005 over an opinion piece in the New York Times Book Review.4 There, Wendy Shalit criticized portrayals of Orthodox Jewish life in contemporary American novels, setting off a debate about how Jews define who is an insider, who is an outsider, and who has the right to represent the Orthodox world. Horowitz challenges Shalit's assumptions by emphasizing the fluidity of Jewishness and noting that, for many Jews, affiliations and degrees of identification shift many times over the course of a lifetime. She calls attention to a "heightened sense of the instability of boundaries of belonging," bringing these points to bear on an illuminating discussion of Tova Mirvis's The Outside World (2004). That novel explores the boundaries between the modem Orthodox and haredi communities, those communities' rules concerning the boundaries between men and women, and the evolving personal boundaries of the protagonists as they grow both toward and away from each other. The next essay continues the discussion of religious affiliation and self- definition as it highlights shifting American Jewish views of authority and community. Wendy Zierler surveys depictions of rabbis in imaginative literature, contextualizing today's representations of the clergy by first filling in some historical background. She covers a wide terrain, from what are today largely forgotten titles (such as Sydney Nyburg's 1917 novel The Chosen People), to the classics (such as Henry Roth's Call It Sleep, 1934), to Harry Kemelman's rabbi mystery series, which began appearing in the mid-1960s. This broad over- view sets the stage for a presentation of contemporary fiction that marks a radical change, as it features women rabbis-particularly in Jonathan Rosen's Joy Comes in the Morning (2004). Jeremy Dauber's article also starts with the long view, thereby leading us to an appreciation of the present. Commenting first on Will Eisner's lifetime achieve- ments and contributions to the comic book genre, Dauber zeroes in on two recent graphic novels of special interest: Fagin the Jew (2003) and The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (published shortly after Eisner's death in 2005). In an art form whose visual strategies rely on stereotypes, Eisner used caricature to combat antisemitism. In his later work, he pointedly turned to polemics and reassessed his approach to self-disclosure as he grappled with matters of Jewish identity. Dauber analyzes and interprets Eisner's artistry to show how American Jewish history and biography informed his oeuvre and so 3. Recent studies include several special issues of scholarly journals. See, for example, Daniel Walden, ed., "The Emerging Landscape: Tradition and Innovation in American Jewish Literature," special issue, Studies in American Jewish Literature (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2003); and Derek Parker Royal, ed., "Unfinalized Moments in Jewish American Narrative," special issue, Shofar 22, no. 3 (Spring 2004). 4.

In the next essay, "Reading for the Plot?" by Naomi Sokoloff, we move from Eisner's Plot to Philip Roth's The Plot against America. Drawing on narratologi- cal approaches, this paper explores the concept of plot in one of the most talked- about novels of 2004. In his primary storyline, Roth imagines an emerging fascism in the United States, with President Charles Lindbergh fomenting a conspiracy against the Jews. The novel moves forward as it relies on a master plot-that is, an overarching framework of references to the Holocaust. But the novelist compli- cates his counterfactual national history with personal plotlines and a cluster of subplots that thematize family history and the continuities of Jewish identity. All this draws heightened attention to the ways in which the characters construct or emplot their own understandings of collective events and forge narrative accounts of the past. In a text filled with ironies and complexities, one of the wiliest of Jewish-American authors creates a fanciful, alternative history while insisting on a nostalgia for his childhood and affirming that Jews cannot escape their history or the need to understand and struggle against antisemitism. The final essay turns to what is at once the newest topic and the most fam- iliar in American Jewish literature: the experience of immigration. Adam Rovner assesses assimilation and its discontents in writing by recent arrivals to the United States and Canada from the former Soviet Union. Focusing on the reception of authors Gary Shteyngart, David Bezmozgis, and Lara Vapnyar, he argues that readers have welcomed such newcomers partly out of nostalgia: nostalgia for the Old World, for the immigrant experience, and for a reassuring sense that Jews remain different from other Americans, their uniqueness not yet abandoned to the melting pot. Rovner observes that even as more contemporary novels emphasize "an expansive or porous sense of ethnic and religious identity" and view "Judaism as performance rather than essence," new immigrant writers often appeal to their audience's longing for Jewish authenticity and distinctive- ness. Yet when these authors draw on long-established American literary stereo- types and when minority characters are understood as prototypically American, the whole notion of distinctive authenticity becomes problematic. Rovner chal- lenges any easy dichotomy between otherness and acculturation, complicating the definitions of Jewishness and essentialism in American Jewish literature today. Inevitably, our understanding and definition of "today" shifts and changes rapidly. We can expect that North American Jewish literature will go through many new transformations in the years to come. However, the preparation of this special issue of the AJS Review has given us an opportunity-at a particularly rich moment of literary growth and experiment-to reflect on and gather our impressions of recent developments. I am grateful to Martin Jaffee and Hillel Kieval, coeditors of the journal, for their part in bringing this publication to fruition. The papers collected in this volume were first presented at a symposium held in April 2005 at the University of Washington (UW) at Seattle.
