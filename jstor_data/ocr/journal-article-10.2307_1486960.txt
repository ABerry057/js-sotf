Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989. x, 194 pp. Azriah de' Rossi's Me'or Einayim, which was first published in 1573 in the author's native-town of Mantua, poses specific problems for scholars wishing to evaluate the purpose and nature of the work. The polymathic erudition displayed on every page of this collection of antiquarian essays, the diverse subject-matter, ranging from a critique of Philo to chronology</page><page sequence="2">320 BOOK REVIEWS and the nature of biblical poetry, and the employment of over a hundred non-Jewish and more than one hundred and fifty Jewish sources do not per- mit any facile interpretation. The primary task of the reader of the work must be to examine the sources which de' Rossi himself cites and to deter- mine the relevant historical and cultural context which informs de' Rossi's discourses. Lester Segal's elegantly written book is divided into two parts. The first part deals with the nature of de' Rossi's historical inquiry and focuses on the ambiguity of de' Rossi's relation to Jewish tradition; the second is concerned with de' Rossi's discussion of aggadah and the Maharal of Prague's critical reaction to it. In the preface, Segal does not indicate his reasons for con- structing the book in this fashion; in fact, it is sometimes difficult to under- stand the link between the chapters. In attempting to illustrate the back- ground to de' Rossi's historical premises, Segal has disregarded de' Rossi's own testimonies and chosen to analyze the work in the context of various non-Jewish historical writings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries which are of a completely different order from de' Rossi's own antiquarian studies. There can be no way of establishing whether de' Rossi was familiar with these works. What is certain, however, is that he was influenced by the work of polymaths such as the Protestant scholar Sebastian Miinster, and in gen- eral, that his choice of subject-matter and critical evaluation of historical sources bear affiliation with biblical scholars both Catholic and Protestant of his own time. Segal views de' Rossi's extensive use of the forgeries of Annius of Viterbo as "flawing his line of enquiry" (p. 30). While this is undoubtedly true, it is perhaps more significant, for those wishing to deter- mine the cultural milieu to which de' Rossi belonged, to realize that Annius' fabrications were a basic text for the majority of scholars of antiquity in the sixteenth century. In the second part of the book, Segal gives a detailed examination of de' Rossi's critique of aggadah and his citation of geonic and later commenta- tors of the aggadah. He correctly discerns de' Rossi's method of truncating his sources and quoting out of context in order to prove that authoritative commentators agree with his opinion. Segal often adduces arguments which cannot be proved, since they are based on sources which de' Rossi does not quote. In one instance, however, he makes an interesting and plausible case. He suggests that de' Rossi deliberately omits reference to interpreters of the aggadah such as Shemtov ibn Shaprut, although their views were more con-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 321 sonant with his own, because they had been made subject to extreme criticism. A major part of the second section of the book is devoted to the Maha- ral's scathing attack on de' Rossi. In a sense, the investigation of the Maha- ral's approach to the aggadot does not assist comprehension of de' Rossi's position. The two writers are proceeding from different premises and describing different levels of reality. What the Maharal defined as essence is called metaphor or symbol by de' Rossi. Unlike the Maharal, de' Rossi's purpose was not to fathom the depths of rabbinic wisdom, but to demon- strate that the historical and scientific data in the aggadot did not concur with historical or scientific truth. By focusing on the internal Jewish sources and on humanist texts which are not apposite for a discussion of de' Rossi's work, Segal has given only a partial account of the problems which the reader of the Me'or Einayim must confront. The question of the uneasy relation between historical conscious- ness and religious tradition necessarily arises consistently throughout the book. But de' Rossi's purpose was not simply to resolve that question. He saw himself as a kind of mediator between Jewish and Christian scholarship, clarifying problems of Jewish history in respect to non-Jewish evidence which he divested of its ideological or religious bias, while indicating the importance of Jewish sources for biblical and related subjects which were being studied by contemporary Christian scholars.
