<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Cheryl Exum. Tragedy and Biblical Narrative: Arrows of the Almighty. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. xiv, 206 pp. The title of this book is carefully worded. It is not "Tragedy in Biblical Narrative" but "Tragedy and Biblical Narrative." The volume is a literary discussion of selected biblical narratives in light of the concept of tragedy. As defined by Exum, tragedy is not a genre. It is, rather, a dimension of certain narratives, a worldview which lacks the reassurance that all is well or will end well. "Tragedy," says Exum, "deals with catastrophe, guilt, necessary suffering, and their essential but unfathomable connection. . . . Tragedy requires that the disaster have some connection with the protagonist's guilt</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 167 and some meaning in terms of the protagonist's life" (p. 11). The struggle against fate is an important aspect of Exum's definition (p. 12). The narratives discussed in this book are those which focus on Jephthah, Saul, the House of Saul, and David. With the possible exception of Jephthah, all are old chestnuts in literary studies of the Bible, and Exum herself has written on some of them; yet there are new insights here, or at least a good way of putting old insights. The most obvious candidate for inclusion, Job, is mentioned in the introductory chapter but not analyzed in detail. This is not an oversight, for the book is about biblical narrative and most of Job is not narrative. Furthermore, as Exum puts it: "The Job of the folktale who acquiesces is not tragic, but the Job of the poem who argues tirelessly against his friends ... is profoundly so" (p. 12). Since it is impossible to discuss tragedy without reference to Greek tragedy and other world literature, there are ample references to Greek drama, Shakespeare, other relevant works, and the secondary literature-all of which makes the book more appealing to a comparative-literature audience. This raises the question of whether tragedy is a proper category to apply to the Bible. Did ancient Israel have a notion of tragedy akin to that of ancient Greece? Do Exum's readings bring to light previously unrecognized aspects of tragedy? Are her readings really dependent on a concept of tragedy? These questions are not easily answered, for Exum, like many literary scholars, resists being pinned down or boxed in. At most, I think she would claim that the concept of tragedy, as she understands it, is helpful in reading parts of the deuteronomic history and finding a unifying thread in several of its major characters. Judged by this criterion, the book is successful-not because it is the only way to read these stories, but because Exum has given us intelligent, sensitive, and coherent readings of them. Jephthah. Exum works hard to make Jephthah a tragic character, for, as she acknowledges, his character is not well developed, he lacks hubris, and he accepts his fate without struggling against it. He "fails to attain genuinely tragic proportions" (p. 57). Why, then, is he included in this discussion? I think it is because the plot of the Jephthah story sounds so much like a Greek tragedy. This is, in itself, an interesting point generally overlooked by biblicists, but it raises questions which Exum does not seem inclined to pursue (like how did a Greek plot get into Judges, why is it so poorly developed, what is the relationship of the tragic element to the etiological ending, and what is a quasi-tragic character doing in a book otherwise populated by comic or</page><page sequence="3">168 BOOK REVIEWS heroic judges). Exum's explication raised these questions for me, but despite her delicate weighing of the various parts of the story, it is still no clearer why Jephthah made his anomalous vow or why the story is so accepting of human sacrifice. (This chapter contains a feminist excursus which tries to reinscribe the daughter, as several feminist readings have done. Judges 11 is an important text for feminist critics, and the story's perplexing issues do not make the feminists' task any easier. Exum, like others, emphasizes the namelessness of the daughter, and her submission to paternal authority, even at the price of her life.) Saul. Saul has long been identified as a tragic figure. Exum brings this out through a comparison with Samson. Both characters are called upon to deliver Israel from the Philistines, both fail and meet ignoble deaths, yet Samson never achieves the tragic depths of Saul. The comparison reveals two contrasting visions of reality: the comic and the tragic. The Samson story, espousing the comic view, emphasizes restoration and resolution. There is a sense of rightness, affirmation of justice, and Israel's life goes on. The Saul story, on the other hand, moves toward rejection and isolation. There will be no sudden deliverance. Things will end badly for Saul and his descendants (see especially p. 26). The discussion of the fate of the members of the House of Saul is especially good, bringing together many previous studies under the unifying rubric of tragedy. David. David admits and resists a tragic reading. He is not tragic like Saul, for he has none of Saul's defiance of his fate. David is a pragmatist, a compromiser. His end comes slowly and undramatically, and the promise of the Davidic line lives on after him. Exum's analysis here, as elsewhere, is on the mark, but might just as well have been done without reference to the concept of tragedy. Does the Bible have a tragic vision? The tragic view which Exum has uncovered is not so much a matter of "human limits" or "the human condition," as she would have it (p. 152). Exum has spoken throughout about individuals, or about the human condition as a whole, but the Bible is best read as the story of a nation-its self-definition, its relationship with God, its past and its future. Where is the tragic vision here? I think that Exum may have glimpsed something but not seen it clearly. She touches on it on page 149: The tragedy of the house of David has only just begun when David dies. The</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 169 remainder of the Deuteronomistic History ... chronicles the woeful events that afflict the Davidic house after the division of the kingdom ... to the catastrophe of exile. David has begotten a line of kings that will end miserably, even as Saul's house ended miserably. .. . even righteous King Josiah is unable to alter the terrible course of destiny. Is it an accident, we may ask, that most of Exum's tragic texts are from the books of Samuel and, to a lesser extent, Kings? (The case for Jephthah is considerably weaker.) I think not, for these are the books about the monarchy, and the monarchy is the locus of the Bible's tragic vision. In terms of Israel's existence and continuity, its relationship with God, even its land and Temple, the Bible has a classic vision of resolution and restitution. But in reference to the monarchy, the Bible's vision may indeed be tragic. Fraught with false starts, the monarchy sustained itself undivided for only two generations. Even divided, its existence is temporary, ending in the exile of Israel and then Judah. The monarchy runs downhill from the beginning to meet its inevitable end (with perhaps a temporary pause at Josiah). The nation will be preserved and returned to its land, the Temple will be rebuilt, but the kingship will not be reestablished. The monarchy is doomed, its tragic fate to be transformed only in the messianic ideal. Adele Berlin University of Maryland College Park, Md.</page></plain_text>
