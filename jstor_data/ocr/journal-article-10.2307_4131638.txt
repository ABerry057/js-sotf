These trends manifest a common desire to reinstate the revelational text (i.e., the Hebrew Bible, the Qur'an) as the sole basis for religious law and practice. They deny or considerably delimit, on the other hand, the role of "received tradition" (i.e., Jewish torah she-be 'alpeh, Islamic Sunnah) as an independent or complementary source of religious authority and legislation. Consequently, the Karaites' rejection of Jewish oral law as codified in the Mishnah and Talmud and their attempt to reinstate the Hebrew Bible (in its entirety) as the binding source for Jewish law and religious practice, have often been described as the Jewish variation on the theme of sola scriptura.1 Two modes of explanation have been pursued with regard to the compara- tive religious phenomena, which are summarized here: 1.

Though the scripturalist ethos was a prominent feature of Karaite ideology throughout its history, the Karaites were bound to develop their own concept of tradition to codify their religious practice.

The major motivation underlying Karaism is intrinsic to so-called sectarian Judaism, which derives from earlier scripturalist models or movements (i.e., the Sadducees or Qumranites).2 According to these scholars, the contribution of Islam lay in encouraging and creating the right atmosphere for these scripturalist trends to surface and manifest themselves openly, first through the messianic activities of Judeo- Persian sectarian movements of the eighth century that preempted Karaism and were partially absorbed into it during the ninth century.3 Especially from the second half of the tenth century, Arabic literature (notably, Mu'tazilite Kalam) also had a formative effect on Karaism, as it did on Rabbanite literature. The Arabic elements in both religious streams are thus understood as reflecting medieval Judaism's general debt to Islam.4 2. The major drive behind Karaism is external to Judaism, borrowed or grafted onto it from Islamic scripturalist models, mainly of a heterodox nature. Scholars who give precedence to the Islamic milieu in the for- mation of Karaism discuss various aspects and degrees of "influence," "interrelation," or "contact," providing detailed arguments concerning the level of Karaite borrowing from Islamic concepts, methodology, and religious customs.5 Others go further in considering the role of 2.

Some even suggest that all "new" content brought to Judaism through Karaism was Islamic in origin, hence its depiction as a form of "Islamic Judaism."6 These polarized positions have been somewhat oversimplified here for the sake of argument. More than they capture the innate complexity of their subject matter, they appear to reflect the tension between the natural interests and academic training of Judaists and Islamicists, as well as a mixed approach to the unsettled and illusive concept of "influence" between cultures. According to neither path of explanation, however, is the impetus behind Karaism sought within what is considered "mainstream" rabbinic thought, that is, evolving directly from the leading intellectual traditions of medieval (geonic) Judaism. The understanding of the rise of Karaism as a result of inner-Jewish forces unique to the internal crisis and the intellectual dynamic of the late geonic period has largely been facilitated by new developments in the study of Karaism, its literature, and its historical origins over the past two decades. Else- where, I have discussed in detail two factors underlying these new developments: first, the entrance of Jewish studies into what has astutely been called a "postideo- logical" era, and second, the discovery-or rather, the renewed availability-of a large corpus of medieval Karaite manuscripts known as the Firkovich collections.7 Friedlander, "Jewish Arabic Studies," Jewish Quarterly Review 1-3 (1910-13); more recent reapprai- sals by Michael Cook, "'Anan and Islam: The Origins of Karaite Scripturalism," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 9 (1987): 161-72, to be discussed in detail in the following; Daniel Lasker, "Islamic Influences on Karaite Origins," in Studies in Islamic Origins and Judaic Traditions, vol. 2, ed.

See Lasker, "Islamic Influences," 23-25, 33-34. 7. Housed mainly in the Russian National Library of St. Petersburg, these contain around 16,000 medieval Karaite manuscripts collected during the 1860s by the Karaite leader and bibliophile Abraham Firkovich (1787-1874) from the genizot of Karaite synagogues and burial grounds in Cairo, Hit (Iraq), and Jerusalem. The manuscripts have been made fully available to scholars and are now in the process of being catalogued at the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts of the Jewish National and University Library. See David Sklare, "A Guide to Collections of Karaite Manuscripts," in Polliack, Karaite Judaism, A Guide, 893-924.

These are summarized here as necessary background to the leading arguments presented in the main part of this article.8 (1) Moshe Gil has conclusively demonstrated that Karaism emerged as a conglomerate movement during the mid-ninth century-not, as is often held, during the mid-eighth century-as the result of the unifica- tion of two distinctive forces that formed something of an unholy coalition.9 These included, on the one hand, a strand from the geonic establishment, namely, the descendants of the Babylonian exilarch (r'osh ha-golah) 'Anan ben David, and on the other hand, a strand com- posed of the adherents of various Jewish heterodox and messianic groups, mainly active in Persia throughout the eighth and ninth centu- ries.10 It has further been shown that 'Anan ben David's grandson, Daniel, was the one ousted from the post of exilarch around 820- 825.11 Daniel's son, also named 'Anan (i.e., 'Anan II), was therefore the figure who actually headed the Karaite schism in the late ninth century.12 It was he who actively joined forces with the adherents of dis- senting groups, such as Benjamin al-NihdwandT and Daniel al-QfimisT, who were of Persian stock.13 This theory provides an explanation for much of the inner tension witnessed in nascent Karaism, including 8. For a detailed discussion of these developments, see Polliack, "Medieval Karaism." 9. See especially Gil, "Kadmoniyot ha-kara'im," 71-101. 10. These are described in Jewish and Muslim sources. For more on their tenets and relation to nascent Karaism, see Yoram Erder, "The Doctrine of Abai 'Isa al-Isfah8nT and its Sources," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 20 (1996): 162-99; and Gil, "Kadmoniyot ha-kara'im," 91-100. 11. It is only in sources from this period that the term benei-mikr'a (sons and proprietors of scripture) is attested as the name of a distinctive religious-political movement whose tenets include messianism, scripturalism, the rejection of received tradition (Oral Law), and geonic authority. The most convincing explanation of this name is that it derives from the Karaites' general affinity for Hebrew scripture (mikr'a) and their mastership of its text. See Gil, "Kadmoniyot ha-kara'im," 97; and Geoffrey Khan, The Early Karaite Tradition of Hebrew Grammatical Thought, Including a Critical Edition, Translation and Analysis of the Diqduq of Abu Ya 'qub Ysuf Ibn Nu~h (Leiden, UK: Brill, 2000), 3. I agree with Khan's observation that alternative explanations offered for the name are "based on too great an emphasis on their (i.e., the Karaites') supposed religio-political division from mainstream Judaism." 12. See Gil, "Kadmoniyot ha-kara'im," 84-91, 100-101. 13. Sources that report 'Anan ben David's imprisonment in the time of the Khalif al-Mansur (mid-eighth century) and those that depict him as the founder of Karaism are all better understood and more plausibly datable to the period of his grandson and great-grandson, who were fused into the 'Anan ben David figure because of their common name and antiestablishment tendencies (Gil, "Kadmoniyot ha-kara'im," 73-74, 84-91, 100-101). For different views of 'Anan ben David's role and the effect of rabbinic polemic on Karaite historiography, see Haggai Ben-Shammai, "Between Ana- nites and Karaites: Observations on Early Medieval Jewish Sectarianism," in Studies in Muslim-Jewish Relations, vol. 1, ed. R. L. Nettler (London: Harwood, 1993), 19-29; and Judith Olszowy-Schlanger, 70</page><page sequence="5">Rethinking Karaism the criticism found in early Karaite literature concerning 'Anan ben David. It also clarifies the differentiation between Ananism and Karaism in Muslim historiographical sources (see following) as one that reflects the synchronic strands rather than the diachronic develop- ment of Karaism. Additionally, Gil has also shown that the Palestinian branch of 'Anan ben David's family continued to function as geonim, heads of the Pales- tinian yeshiva, well into the late ninth century.14 It was only after they were ousted from their position by the competing geonic family of Ben Me'ir that they, too, came to identify with the Karaite cause. This factor sheds important light on the Karaites' Palestinocentric ideology as part of the wider tensions between the competing Babylonian and Palestinian centers, which formed a continuing source of crisis in Judaism from antiquity to medieval times. Hence, a major motivation behind Karaism, unrecognized until recently, was the attempt to strengthen the intellectual traditions and leadership of Palestine over those of Babylonia. This explanation is complemented by Fred Astren's analysis of nascent Karaism in the context of the clash between the centrifugal pull of the rich local traditions, which sought to maintain their unique identity, and the centripetal force of the intellectual centers, which realized the necessity of unification in the face of Islam.15 (2) Several studies conducted over the past decade have significantly clari- fied the nature of early Karaite grammatical thought and Arabic Bible translation and exegesis, forming an integrative view of early Karaite intellectual creativity in these interconnected fields. The overall con- clusion, independently corroborated by each of these studies, is that the great Karaite scholars who were active in the Karaite house of study in Jerusalem throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries were heirs to long-standing localized Jewish traditions of biblical study and interpretation. Some of these traditions, such as grammatical study of the Bible, were likely to have been transferred by the ninth- and tenth-century Karaite 6migr6s to Jerusalem from their cities of origin in Iraq and Persia; others the Karaites may well have encountered while arriving in Palestine, which had a rich and long-standing history of biblical learning (particularly of Bible translation and Masorah). The specific learning traditions embraced and developed by the Karaites may be traced back to the eighth century and even earlier in the Islamic era, Karaite Marriage Documents from the Cairo Geniza, Legal Tradition and Community Life in Medieval Egypt and Palestine, vol. 1 (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1998), 5-8. 14. This branch included the descendants of 'Anan ben David's other grandchild, Josiah (Daniel's brother). Both were the offspring of 'Anan's only son, Saul. 15. See Astren, "Islamic Contexts," 146-56; and Astren, Karaite Judaism, 26-30. 71</page><page sequence="6">Meira Polliack clearly predating the schism between Karaites and Rabbanites. The Karaites were not only familiar with these local traditions but also apt to preserve them as part of their anticentralistic (anti-Babylonian) stance and to continue developing them because of their fields of interest, specific expertise, and general scriptural orien- tation. Gradually, after Karaism came to be viewed as a separate branch of Judaism, these traditions were wrongly perceived as uniquely Karaite and so became artificially dissociated from their general Jewish milieu. In this context, Geoffrey Khan has convincingly demonstrated the linkage between the early Karaite grammatical tradition preserved in the works of the tenth-century grammarian Abai Ya'qiib Yfisuf Ibn Niih and some Judeo-Persian as well as protomasoretic works mainly preserved in the Cairo Genizah.16 He has also pointed out that the Hebrew term ba 'alei mikr'a, which in some medieval texts designates the Karaites, is also applied to the Masoretes and used in earlier rabbinic literature to define those exclusively engaged in biblical study, as distinct from those who specialize in Mishnah and gemara.'7 Therefore, the Karaites are likely to have derived their name from their identification with such professional Jewish circles, which specialized in the preservation and study of the biblical text per se. On the practical level, they continued the textual study of the Bible typical of these circles, while on the ideological level, this type of specialization endorsed their scriptural focus and orientation. Only at a later stage, when Karaism consolidated into a religiopolitical movement and its antirabbinic stance was sharpened, did the name kara'im take on the antitraditionalist sense of those who hold steadfast to written law as opposed to those who follow oral law. With regard to the fields of Arabic Bible translation and exegesis, the Karaites' intellectual debt to earlier Jewish intellectual traditions has also been demonstrated at length. The great Karaite translator and exegete of the tenth century, Yefet ben 'Eli, relied on the earlier (pre-Saadianic) modes of Arabic Bible translation that were current among oriental Jews. Similarly, some of the exegetical principles he applied to the biblical text openly derived from rabbinic hermeneutics (including certain Hebrew midot) corresponding to the manner in which Ibn Nfih and other Karaite grammarians relied on Hebrew masoretic terminology. These exegetical principles were adapted and developed by Yefet into a much deeper and wider concern with narrative techniques in the Hebrew Bible. 18 16. See Geoffrey Khan, Early Karaite Grammatical Texts, Masoretic Studies Series 9 (Atlanta, GA: Society of Biblical Literature, 2001), 127-49; and Khan, The Early Karaite Tradition, 1-24. Note Kahn's conclusion concerning Karaite grammatical terminology: "One should not necessarily attempt to trace the background of certain terms and concepts to one particular tradition. It is more likely that many of the Hebrew terms have their origin in the early Islamic period (7th-8th centuries), when the Near East was a melting pot of ideas... Some Hebrew terms may have been borrowed by the masoretic and Rabbinic traditions from the Syriac and Hellenistic schools even before the rise of Islam" (24). 17.

The tendency to compartmentalize Karaite literature as that of a Jewish "sect" wrongly disassociated the Karaites' achievements from mainstream rabbi- nic thought, marginalizing and diminishing the importance of Karaite literature as a vital and inseparable manifestation of the intellectual history of medieval Judaism. Unraveling these developments is essential for understanding the hypothesis underlying the main part of this article, including its leading arguments and conclusions--namely; that Karaism, in the main, is more fruitfully explained as an expression of a crisis within mainstream medieval Jewish thought, constitut- ing an "inner-Jewish" development in terms of its historical origins, ideology, and literature. Categorical terms such as "inner-Jewish" only mark artificial boundaries (hence the use of quotation marks). Nevertheless, they still serve our conceptualization of the data. Such a stance does not preclude, however, the significance of "extra-Jewish" or "nonmainstream" catalysts, considering that Judaism's live and organic development never existed in isolation from other cultures. As a complementary part of the endeavor to demarcate the main cultural forces behind the rise of Karaism, however, the bulk of this article is devoted to a fresh examination and reconsideration of some of the major argumentation provided by scholarship with respect to Islamic influence on early Karaism.19 RECONSIDERING THE ISLAMIC INFLUENCE ON KARAISM The question of Islamic influence on-or preferably, the Islamic contexts of-Karaism20 forms part of the wider question of cross-cultural interchange and the ways in which the Jews responded and adapted to Arabic culture. The use of Muslim theological discourse (kaldim), certain Arabic writing conventions (such as prefacing a work or applying genre distinctions), and Arabic exegetical concepts (such as tafsTr and ta'wTl) by the Karaites is essentially no different than their use by Saadiah Gaon and his Rabbanite followers.21 The respective attempts to consolidate an Arabic translation of the Hebrew Bible among the Rabbanites and Karaites, as yet another example, reflect the same motivation in answering the linguistic and religious needs experienced by all Jews of the Islamic world after their adoption of the Arabic tongue.22 19. A parallel endeavor was undertaken with regard to the sectarian (Qumranic) sphere of influ- ence in Polliack, "Wherein Lies the Pesher?" 20. As termed by Astren; see note 5. 21. See, for example, Moshe Zucker, Perushei rav sa 'adyah ga'on li-bereshit (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1984), 35-69; and David Sklare, Samuel ben Hofni Gaon and His Cultural World, Texts and Studies (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1996), 37-67. 22.

In the fields of law, jurisprudence, and religious practice, it is inevitably difficult to determine a clear direction of influence (see dis- cussion in the following), whereas in the fields of theology, literature, language, and exegesis and in the particular terminology and literary models introduced by the Arabs in their respect, the Jews (Rabbanites and Karaites alike) were influenced not so much by Islam as such but by the Arabization of Jewish culture. In this, they took part in the wider phenomenon of the remodeling of Near Eastern cultures and literatures as a result of the linguistic Arabization of the region. This remodeling affected, to a similar extent, Jews, Christians, and newly converted Muslims alike, all of whom were engaged in a process of adoption and adaptation to Arabic culture that continued throughout the ninth and even well into the tenth century, especially in regions such as Syro-Palestine, where Muslims had not yet attained an absolute majority. Moreover, it is often overlooked that some of the new intellectual trends were themselves products of an Islamic (Arab) adaptation of Greek, Syriac, and even Hebrew and Aramaic traditions.23 The peril inherent in discussions that are quick to associate the effects of Arabization with various "borrowings" from Islam is particularly evident when these hang their case on common terminology. Such is the recurrent scholarly claim that the ninth- and tenth-century Karaite usage of interpretive terminology typical of Shi'ite Qur'anic exegesis (such as batin, tdhir, ta'wTl,'ijtihdd) necessarily implies that early Karaism was informed, modeled on, and even prompted by Shi'ite Islam.24 In effect, as has already been mentioned, these terms often appear in Rabbanite sources as well and therefore tell us nothing about Karaism's specific debt to Shi'ism.25 More importantly, however, as illumi- nated by Drory, such exegetical terms and concepts often mislead us into thinking that the actual content or methodology of Karaite exegesis derives from Shi'ite or other Islamic exegetical sources when, in effect, these remain distinctively 23. See Khan's observation in note 16. I would like to express my gratitude to the appointed reader of this article on the part of AJS Review, whose instructive comments sharpened my awareness of this point. 24. See, as a typical illustration, Yoram Erder's recent discussion of this aspect in his 'Avelei ziyon ha-kara'im 'u-megilot qumran, le-toldot halufah la-yahadut ha-rabanit (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz ha-meuhad, 2004), 355-63, wherein he argues for the general influence of Shi'ite exegesis on Karaite exegesis, claiming Imami Shi'ism's view of the Mahdi affected the Karaites' understanding of the role of the moreh zedek and for the specific influence of the works of Isma'ili Shi'ism, particularly Kirmani, on Karaite exegetes such as Yefet ben 'Eli. In effect, Erder relies almost comple- tely on common terms found in these works, which are of an arbitrary nature, and on a selective reading of Zucker's and Drory's detailed studies. He ignores, for example, Drory's important differentiation between aspects of content, methodology, and terminology (see note 26). 25. See note 21. Zucker's study (Perushey sa'adyah, 35-69), alongside Drory's examination of Karaite writing models and exegetical modes (Reshit ha-maga 'im, 81-128), are the most detailed com- parative studies of Qur'anic and medieval (Rabbanite and Karaite) exegesis so far. The majority of com- parative studies that appear to touch on this field (see the list in note 33), however, such as Georges Vajda, Deaux commentares Karaites sur I'ecclksiaste (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1971) are orientated toward common theological (kalam) aspects rather than exegetical practices and ideology. 74</page><page sequence="9">Rethinking Karaism dependent on Jewish and Hebraic exegetical tradition.26 In other words, as in the case of early Karaite grammatical terminology, exegetical terms of this sort often constitute elements borrowed from Arabic thought, which more often than not function as calques that are loaded with the semantic range of a preexisting Hebrew, Aramaic, or Syriac term.27 Ta'wTl, for example, was mostly employed by the early Karaites as a calque for midrash or midrashic ways of interpretation, with little if no echo of its precise sense in Qur'anic exegesis. From a linguistic perspective, this is, of course, quite logical because, in general, terms and concepts borrowed from a dominant (imperial) language or culture tend to constitute the veneer of intellectual debate among other language speakers who come under its sphere of political influence (compare the indiscriminate usage of terms such as "deconstruction" and "narrative" in postmodern Israeli discourse). Such usage rarely conveys an actual, not to mention deep familiarity with the original meaning, context, or source texts in which these terms and concepts were first introduced and defined. Finally, there is a tautological dimension to the compara- tive study of Hebraic and Arabic terminology in the formative period of the eighth to the tenth centuries: It is bound to recoil from the question of initial borrowings of early Islam from Judaism, particularly in the sphere of legal discourse, which in revelational religions is naturally informed by exegetical terminology. This aspect cannot be easily set aside or dismissed when discussing the opposite effect of Islam on Judaism in later generations because it may well have rested on a common consciousness forged earlier in time.28 In sum, giving precedence to inner-Jewish dynamic and development as the decisive factor in the formation of Karaism is not tantamount to denying or under- estimating the formative influence of Islamic and Arabic culture on the intellectual history of medieval Judaism. Scholarly research, as is often the case in the study of comparative cultural phenomena, is marred by unproductive attempts to establish a direction of influence whereas the attainable and fruitful objective lies in the identification and interpretation of the more salient elements within the complex process of cross-cultural interaction. In essence, the search for influence, an outgrowth of nineteenth-century scholarship, obscures our understanding of this formative period in the history of the Near East as one in which there was a "melting pot" of intellectual ideas and traditions; in which Judaism, alongside other religions, including Islam itself, adapted to a new cultural and intellectual 26. Drory (Reshit ha-maga 'im, 119-22) rightly differentiates, in my view, between aspects of structure, general exegetical conceptions, and terminology, wherein the Karaites adopted the Arabic model of exegetical writing as opposed to aspects of content and methodology in which they did not. With respect to the latter two, her detailed study makes clear that the Karaites relied much more on the "internal needs" of Karaite writing and were dependent on existing and ancient modes of Jewish discourse.

Therefore, the following discussion is devoted to reexamining the depiction of Karaism in Islamic sources (section 1-2) and evaluating the role played by the Islamic milieu, particularly sectarian or heterodox Islam, in the formation of Karaism (section 3). 1. Karaism in Islamic Historiography The question of the sources from which the medieval Muslim authors derived their cursory knowledge of Jewish sectarianism has served as the focus of various studies. These sources have been shown to be partly reliant on Christian materials and, to an undefined extent, on Karaite and Rabbanite informers.30 A key issue in the evaluation of the Islamic sources is how much of their relatively favorable depiction of the Karaites and their beliefs, as compared with their view of the Rabbanites, was fashioned by their authors' independent identification of common traits between Karaism and Mu'tazilite kalam. In other words, were the Muslim authors more sympathetic toward Karaism than Rabbanism because they were naturally attracted by these traits, and hence may have come to exagge- rate them in their reports? On the one hand, we know that at least some of the sources they relied on, whether they were Christian reports (traditionally adverse to rabbinic Judaism) or Karaite voices that wished to promote the Karaite image and cause in Muslim eyes, were already tendentious in this respect. On the other hand, the Muslim reports exhibit faithfulness to the historical reality of the Jews of their time (and possibly earlier times) by drawing a clear distinction between various groups among them. The renowned historian al-Mas'tidT (b. Baghdad ca. 280/893) was the first to enumerate four groups of Jews, which are partially referred to in other Muslim 29. I am grateful to the appointed reader of this article on the part of AJS Review for the helpful suggestions in rephrasing this section. 30. See Steve Wasserstrom, Species of Misbelief: A History of Muslim Heresiography of the Jews (PhD diss., University of Toronto, 1985), 35-79, who argues esp. for the Christian origin. Camilla Adang, on the other hand, is more inclined to accept that the Muslim authors' impression of the closeness between Karaism and Islam was fostered by Karaite interlocutors or sources (esp. in the case of Ibn Hazm). See her Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible.: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1996), 95-96. Nevertheless, Adang considers that "none of them exclusively relied on information of Karaite origin." See "The Karaites as Portrayed in Medieval Islamic Sources" in Polliack, Karaite Judaism, A Guide, 195.

S. D. Goitein (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1974), 103-38. 76</page><page sequence="11">Rethinking Karaism sources. These include the Samaritans, Rabbanites ('ashma 'at), 'Ananinites ('ana- niyya, which he defines as "the party that professes the justice and unity of God, or 'ahl al-'adl wal-tawhTd), and Karaites (qara'iyya)."31 The blurring of the names 'Ananites and Karaites in later Muslim sources may, in fact, reflect an authentic understanding that the latter two groups were historically interconnected in some way. In light of the recent reappraisal of Karaism as a substantial intellectual force and constituent of medieval Judaism, as outlined previously, its overall portrayal by the Muslim authors as a parallel stream of thought, juxtaposed with Rabbanism, suggests they captured something of its prominence. This is not- withstanding the limitations of their personal agendas and their specific Muslim interpretation and interest in the comparative phenomenon of heterodoxy.32 In summary, the overall view of Karaism in Islamic sources may be given more weight in its corroboration of the historical centrality of this Jewish religious stream throughout the ninth through eleventh centuries. It still remains difficult, however, to learn directly from these sources the extent to which nascent Karaism was dependent on Islamic religious trends and literature. 2. General notions of Islamic Influence on Karaism After the postwar era, the main historical and literary discussions concerning the extent of Karaite religious and theological borrowing from Islam were published throughout the 1980s.33 These discussions were not yet fully aware of the new deve- lopments, namely, the Firkovich manuscripts and the changing viewpoint on Karaism outlined previously. It is therefore appropriate to reevaluate some of their conclusions. In the following sections, I have chosen to concentrate mainly on Michael Cook's model of Islamic heterodoxy as a representative case (see 31. The term 'ashma 'at appears to derive from Aramaic shema 'ata (Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism, 81-82) in the sense of "transmitted tradition" (see, for example, B. Sotah 40a), yet compare to Wasserstrom's alternative explanation (Species of Misbelief 54-59). On the evidence provided by al-Mas 'tidi, al-Maqdisi and other Muslim authors, see Wasserstrom, Species of Misbelief 86-89, 350f.; Adang, Muslim Writers, 80-109; Adang, "The Karaites as Portrayed"; and Gil, "Karaite Antiqui- ties," 82-83. 32. It should be noted, nevertheless, that al-Mas 'tidi refers to the 'ashma 'at as "the great majority of Jews" (Adang, "The Karaites as Portrayed," 181). Even if this report is not based on Rabbanite informers, it does not preclude the possibility that the Karaites' intellectual force was far greater than their numerical proportion, as is often the case with influential historical movements. 33.

Some general notions or preconceptions of the Karaites' dependency on Islamic methodology and customs are common to almost all of the historical and literary discussions mentioned earlier, and these are briefly surveyed here.34 Principles of law. The Karaite adaptation or application of the four principal methods of Islamic jurisprudence has drawn much attention. These methods include (1) scripture (nass), namely, qur'an in Islamic law and mikr'a in Karaite law; (2) analogy (qiyyds/hekesh); (3) consensus ('ijma'/kibuz or 'edah); and (4) transmitted tradition (naql/sevel or yerushah). The transculturation process of these principles has often been discussed in light of the possible connection between early Karaism and Hanafism. This connection is almost exclusively based on the story that 'Anan ben David served time in prison with a Muslim legal authority, first recorded in the twelfth century.35 Another leading principle upheld by Mu'tazilite Islam concerns individual effort in Qur'anic exegesis ('ijtihad). It has been correlated with the Karaites' emphasis on this type of effort in biblical study, which they call hippus, and for which they use the same concept as the Muslims when writing in Arabic ('ijtihad). On this basis, it has been claimed that the three leading principles of Karaite jurisprudence-namely, scripture, analogy, consensus, and transmission (the latter two are counted as one in Karaism, naql wal-'ijmd')36-when brought together by the methodology of individual exegesis ('ijtihdd), clearly mirror the basic system and principles of Islamic law ('usul al-fiqh). On the other hand, these principles have also been shown to reflect ancient rabbinic methods of biblical study and halakhic derivation in that they partially rely on Hebraic and Aramaic terminology. The connection between Islamic qiyyds and Talmudic hekesh, for example, is a long-standing crux of the study of influence and counterinfluence between Judaism and Islam.37 Even the Karaite emphasis on 'ijtihad/hippus depends, to a certain extent, on ancient Jewish norms of delving into scripture.38 In this respect, it is important to recall that Natronai Gaon (of Sura, ca. 853-61 CE) cursed 'Anan and his descendents for creating "a Talmud of their own.'"39 Pointedly, he did not blame them for 34.

Certain Karaite rituals, such as the washing of feet before prayer and prostration during prayer, have often been cited in support of its derivative nature as "Islamic Judaism," although the evidence, as argued by Lasker, is inde- cisive. Prostration in particular is hinted at in the Hebrew Bible and in rabbinic literature, and Abraham Maimonides actually tried to reintroduce it into Rabbanite worship by claiming that it was originally a Jewish, pre-Islamic mode of worship. The more persuasive argument in this respect, however, is that prostration, like other prayer rituals, may have been an entrenched local custom in certain Jewish communities of the Orient.41 The extensive variety of religious customs between the geonic centers and the peripheries of the oriental Jewish world and the effect of Islamization on the unification of the Jewish world have only recently been fully incorporated into the discussion of medieval Karaism. The severe social tensions that resulted from the authorities' attempts to strengthen their stronghold by uprooting discre- pancies and unifying Jewish worship and religious practice, prompted by the Islamic model, may have served as a significant factor, as suggested by Astren, in the fermentation of the Karaite rift.42 Finally, even if one were to argue that prostration, as a local Jewish custom, can only be dated from Islamic times, this still does not tell us much of the Islamic nature or origin of Karaism. There is ample ethnographic evidence that minorities often adopt such customs from the majority culture without conceiving of them as a compromising influence on the integrity or continuity of their religion.43 The observation of the new moon remains the most difficult aspect of Islamic ritual in Karaism. Nonetheless, it is recognized even in rabbinic sources that the visual establishment of the calendar according to eyewitnesses was standard in Second Temple times (M. Rosh ha-Shanah 1-2). In fact, as Sacha Stern points out, only as late as 1123 did the rabbinic authority and astronomer Abraham b. Hiyya (d. Barcelona, 1136) first claim, on the basis of geonic sources from the ninth century, that the calendar had been reformed into a fixed, calculation-based calendar by Hillel b. Judah, known as Hillel II, and instituted in 358 CE. This tradition was adopted in later Jewish sources and modem scholarship, though other medieval authorities supplied different testi- monies that also attributed the fixed calendar to early rabbinic figures. It is doubtful, therefore, that the fixed calendar was firmly in place among Jews 40. Some of the parallels that have been pointed out between 'Anan's Sefer Mizvot and Islamic law, such as the prohibition against uncle-niece marriages, can be traced to Second Temple Jewish practices, which remained in dispute in rabbinic sources. See Lasker, "Islamic Influence," 33. 41. See Lasker, "Islamic Influence," 33-34. 42. Nonrabbanized local communities, for example, may have wished to defend their identity and traditional practices by espousing the Karaite cause. See Astren, "Islamic Contexts," 146-56; and Astren, Karaite Judaism and Historical Consciousness, 26-30. 43. Similarly, the custom of wearing a white dress at Jewish weddings, documented in Europe since the Middle Ages, does not infer that Ashkenazi Jewry conceived of such Christian influence as compromising its religious integrity. 79</page><page sequence="14">Meira Polliack before the Islamic period; the more likely explanation, offered by Stem, is that it spread gradually throughout the Jewish world.44 Moreover, the Karaites uphold the ancient Jewish practice of intercalation, namely, the fixing of leap years in accordance with agricultural conditions, which is not attested in the Islamic calendar. Vague notions of the previously mentioned traits that are common to Karaism and Islam are often superficially rehashed in general studies without clear-cut evidence or, more importantly, without renewed access to the sources. Such recourse is clearly a desideratum for future research. 3. Karaism in the context of Islamic heterodoxy In a key article titled "'Anan and Islam: The Origins of Karaite Scriptur- alism,"45 Michael Cook addresses in detail the question of the possible affinity between the rise of Karaism and heterodox Islamic trends of the eighth century. Cook begins by pointing out the early scholarly controversy, aroused by Graetz (1895), who first referred to the analogous nature of Karaism and Shi'ism with respect to their scripturalist ethos. In response, Friedlaender (1910-13) and others claimed this was a misinterpretation of the Shi'ites' stance because the followers of 'Ali did not contest the authentic character of the Sunnah. They objected, rather, to the legitimacy of the Companions as the Sunnah's bearers.46 Cook accepts this point of criticism yet remarks that scholars such as Graetz were guided by "the correct perception that orthodox Islam-like Rabbinic Judaism--combines a written revelation with an oral tradition; from this they go on to seek in heterodox Islam a model for Karaite Scripturalism."47 Building on the documentation of Muslim scripturalism in works by I. Goldziher, J. Schacht, J. van Ess, and J. Wansbrough,48 Cook provides eigh- teen additional attestations in "establishing the existence of scripturalism and of the concomitant rejection of tradition in Islam...at a time approximately contemporary with the Karaite schism."49 The attestations are collated 44. See Sacha Stem, Calendar and Community: A History of the Jewish Calendar, 2nd Century BCE to 10th Century CE (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 175-81, 233. I am grateful to the appointed reader of this article on the part of AJS Review, who referred me to this work and made clear the belated claims concerning the fixed calendar. Heated controversies concerning the calendar are known to have continued well into the tenth century. See also Lasker, "Islamic Influence," 33 and esp. n. 71-74. 45. Cook, "'Anan and Islam," 161-72.

These contain antitraditionalist statements attributed to dialectical theologians (muta- kallimi7n) and Kharijites or reported by traditionalists, such as the jurist al- Shafi'i (d. 204/820), who polemicized in their works with scripturalist views.50 As admitted by Cook, the antitraditionalist stance expressed in these sources is by no means unequivocal. They do not uphold scripturalism as the ultimate alternative to tradition: "In Islam, as not in Judaism, we seem to have to do with a spectrum of opinion rather than a polarisation into two camps."5 The evidence provided by Cook nonetheless establishes the existence of a specific anti- traditionalist trend in early Islam. The burden of proof with regard to the Karaites, however, still remains. In other words, does it necessarily follow that if such a trend existed in Islam during the eighth and ninth centuries, the early Karaites were exposed to it and, moreover, adopted it? Early Karaite sources, some of which have only recently become fully available, attest the Karaites expressed a staunch antitraditionalist position and a full-fledged scripturalist stance from the very start of their movement in the mid- ninth century. Moreover, as will be shown later, their ideology in this respect was deeply connected to their historical and ideological view of the national and political state of the Jews in exile (al-jalfit). In light of these sources, it is question- able whether sectarian Muslim views, admittedly of an uneven quality in their antitraditionalist argumentation, would have provided the main impetus behind one of the most enduring and well-argued causes of nascent Karaism. Because this point is central to the understanding of the Islamic context of Karaism, it is important to elaborate on the precise nature of early Karaite scripturalism and to clarify the concept of Jewish scripturalism in general. The early Karaite claim concerning the innate falsity of Oral Law. The Mutakallimun (and later on, the Shi'ites) mostly focused on the unreliability of the transmission chain that traced traditions back to the prophet Muhammad, emphasizing the frailty, faultiness, and manipulative nature of human memory,52 whereas early Karaite sources expressed an unequivocal rejection of 50. Cook, "'Anan and Islam," 166-74 (for attestations derived from al-Shafi'T, see n. 4 and 13 there). Al-Shdfi'i expanded on the generally accepted sources of Muslim law (sharf'ah)-namely, the Qur'an, the Sunnah (custom) of Muhammad, and the inclusive ijmd' (consensus)-by adding qiyyds (analogical reasoning), which remained flexible and widely applicable in the Muslim schools of law. He revolutionized sharT'ah by reducing dependence on local law and establishing a "scientific" method for evaluating traditions emanating from the prophet Muhammad in preference to other traditions that had been used to support the ancient schools (see Schacht, Origins, 44-52, 98-102). Al-Shafi'i set up a different school of jurisprudence to that of Abfi Hanlfa's school of personal opinion and analogy (on whom, see n. 35 herein). He too, nevertheless, is known to have warned against accepting unquestionably either his own or someone else's opinion. 'Anan, who also used ana- logical reasoning, would be credited by the tenth-century Karaite Yefet ben 'Eli with a similar saying, "Search thoroughly in the Torah, and do not rely on my opinion." See Yefet' s commentary on Zechariah 5:8, first cited by Samuel Poznanski, "'Anan et ses Ecrits," Revue des dtudesjuives 44 (1902-03): 184 and fully provided herein. 51.

Karaite argumentation did not explore the weak- nesses in the rabbinic chain of transmission (preserved in M. Avot), which traced the traditions of the Sages (the Tannaim) back to the prophet Moses. Moreover, the Karaites were not preoccupied with exposing faults in the abundant rabbinic 'isncds (chains of attribution) preserved in Talmudic literature. Their starting point was crucially different: They simply did not accept that Oral Law embodied any kind of live or authentic tradition that could hail back to Moses, not even rem- nants of such a tradition. Pioneering Karaite figures such Daniel al-QilmisT (late ninth century) or Yefet ben 'Eli (second half of the tenth century) considered the Mishnaic claim as to the mere existence of such a tradition to be utterly false. Moses was never given an oral Torah by God; the only Torah dictated to him was the written Torah as it has come down to us.53According to the early Kar- aites, therefore, oral Torah was a concept invented by the rabbis during the Second Temple period and served to establish their interpretive authority, over and above the authority of others, in determining the meaning of biblical law and biblical lite- rature in general. The halakhic decisions the Tannaim and Amoraim arrived at in this respect form part of a mistaken tradition, precisely because they confuse a human source of knowledge, "a commandment of men learned by rote" (Isaiah 29:13, mizvat 'anashim melummadah) with a divine one. In the eyes of the early Karaites, this mistaken tradition prolonged the existence of the Jews in a state of sin, which explained, in turn, their extended exile, loss of sovereignty, and humiliation among the nations. The following excerpt from Yefet ben 'Eli's allegorical commentary on Zechariah 5:5-8 exemplifies this viewpoint, which is also attested to in earlier sources:54 And in the end of the time of the exile those books which the people claim to have been (derived) from Moses55 will become obsolete, and no one will their affinity to those of the Hanifi school, see Schacht, Origins, 258-59. With regard to the Kharijite sources, Cook emphasizes that although they clearly attest to a scripturalist stance, "they do not expli- citly identify the rejected alternative as tradition" (170). Among the attestations from traditionalist polemics, the main focus is on the objection to the writing down of oral tradition-see, for example, attestations 17, 18 (173-74). 53. The concept of written Torah was not confined by the Karaites to the Pentateuch, but it was symbolically extended to all twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible, as was common in rabbinic literature as well. 54. Yefet classifies his interpretation as the nonliteral or allegorical sense of this passage (fa-hddhd ta'wTl al-Jasl).

He said (Zechariah 5:7): "One woman"-for they (=the Rabbanites) are one band and they hold onto one tradition. And he said (vs. 7): "sitting in the container (epha)"-for they are subordinated according to cited names as the prophets are cited in God's Scripture, as it is said: Rabbi so and so (=son of so and so) iterated a halakhah to Rabbi so and so. He said (vs. 8): "This is the wicked one"-and he called her a wicked woman in order to demonstrate that they (=the Rabbanites) are sinners before God. For they composed these (Talmudic) books61 and compelled the nation to believe in them and to act according to them and condemned to death those who disagreed with them. They did not say: so we reason, and so it occurred to us, and search62 yourselves O Israel as we have searched. Had they done so, they would have been saved from the condemnation of the Lord of the Universe. For this is what 'Anan (ben David) did, who said "search diligently in the Torah and do not rely on my opinion," and Benjamin (Nihawandi) said in concluding his words: "I Benjamin am one of thousands and scores of thousands and am not a prophet, son of a prophet" etc.63 And so all the Karaite scholars used this method and established what appeared to them as the truth and encouraged people to search (themselves), so much that a man is entitled to disagree with his father and the father will not say to him: why have you disagreed with me? and a student with his Rabbi. This is why God forgave them when error befell some of their opinions, and they were absolved because they opened the eyes of men and brought them out of darkness into light.64 key phrases or sentences, as here, 1IrV t~t N myxN N ''ft  rn~, for the benefit of readers versed in Judeo-Arabic. 56. rmi77:?x r llrnn'x - l' 57.

The rejection of Oral Law as a mistaken interpre- tive tradition would enable the spiritual lifting of the perpetual state of sin in which the Jews had existed since Roman exile and even before. It was thus a necessary step in rectifying their national predicament. The time required for the proper reinterpretation of scripture meant the Karaites could not replace oral traditions at a satisfactory pace. With regard to the legal corpus of the Bible, this presented an existential problem that left them in a state of limbo: not beholden to the accepted norms, yet at the same time, not fully committed to new ones. The Karaites' justification in their own eyes, however, was that they had begun the inevitable process of revision, which would break a millennium of interpretive deadlock and eventually lead the nation back to the right path. They understood this process, however, as one of trial and error and demanded candidness in this respect, partly in counter- reaction to what they perceived as rabbinic conceit in espousing the heavenly (and "free of mistakes") derivation of Oral Law. The concern that they may be committing error in their study of the law and scripture at large is evident in many of their works, including the passage quoted earlier, but it finds poignant expression in the following section from Yefet's introduction to his commentary on Deuteronomy:66 From the Giver of Knowledge I ask that he steady us in the correct way, bene- volently and with kindness, and that he open our eyes to his laws, as the masters of old asked of God, and said (Psalm 119:33, 18): "Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,",67 "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things of thy law."'6 And we ask of Him, whose mention is exalted, that He forgive the errors and mistakes which may transpire, and that He absolve us from any admonition, for He knows our intention, for we do not intend to be at variance with Him, but we seek the truth. (He knows) that we are interpreting the words of the (Karaite) scholars, may God have mercy on them,69 and may he establish them, for they opened the eyes of the people of Exile who dwell in darkness, that in which we are now, and taught them, and instructed 65. -rnxi rin nn'n, m rrn in rli ,?, ,'-ft nn-'l, ?-,n o '7, n% -r m IVA.,, 0' 1I 66.

The Karaite objection to Oral Law was essentially derived from a nationally orientated, messianic frame of mind that had little to do with heterodox Islam but was well rooted in Jewish intellectual tradition and historical thinking and inspired by it. The Karaites were responding to a long-standing Jewish preoccupation when they linked national salvation to the need to reinvent biblical interpretation by dis- connecting it from what they perceived as the distorted interpretation instituted by Oral Law. Their "return" movement to Palestine (they called themselves shavim, in the physical and spiritual sense), which was led by Daniel al-Qilmisi around 880 CE, and their establishment of a center of learning in Jerusalem were yet another manifestation of this messianic drive.70 The Karaites' argumentation with respect to oral tradition echoes the same type of combination of antitraditionalism and messianic sentiment found in ancient sectarian Jewish circles, as well as in later periods of crisis. The Qumranites, for example, contested the interpretive authority of the Pharisees in determining the precise meaning and practice of biblical law by rejecting their assertion that Oral Law derived from a divine source. They clearly believed that in severing this cord, they were hastening their liberation from Roman occupation. This analogy, however, does not prove that the Karaites had access to Qumranic sources, as some would suggest; it simply demonstrates a historical parallel and the existence of similar motivations in the opposition to the institution of Oral Law throughout different stages of Jewish intellectual history.71 Though it is evident that the Karaites also disparaged the chain of rabbinic transmission as such, this should not be confused with the Muslim dispute over the legitimate heirs to Muhammad's Sunnah. For the Karaites, the core issue remained the falsity of the mere conception of an oral tradition attributed to Moses, which they considered to have been concocted by the rabbis. When the Karaites themselves were forced to acknowledge the necessity of some form of transmitted tradition in unifying their halakhah, they presented it as a technical legalistic tool, deliberately naming it sevel or yerushah (a "carried burden," inherited from earlier generations).72 They rejected the term masoret (transmitted tradition), not only 70.

Scripturalism as an Interpretive Orientation in Judaism In Cook's view, the scripturalist attestations embedded in the heterodox Islamic sources not only further establish the existence of a scripturalist trend in Islam but also strengthen the assumption of a doctrinal connection between Karaism and Muslim scripturalism. The question of the direction of influence is, nevertheless, what truly interests Cook, namely, is Karaism the result of hetero- dox Muslim influence on Judaism, or does it represent a form of Jewish scriptur- alism that, in turn, influenced Islam? He eventually endorses the first explanation, not only on the basis of the attestations and their dating but also in consideration of the general criticism voiced in the Qur'an and Hadith literature concerning the Jews' failure to observe the wording of their scripture.73 In other words, the archaic concern with the literal interpretation of Pentateuchal law in early Islam reflects points of polemical contact in the Islamic scripturalist attack on rabbinic Judaism, and this concern seems to have been internalized by some Jews, nurtur- ing the Karaite-Rabbanite rift. If we were to carry Cook's line of thought further than he claims, it could be suggested that the medieval Jewish uneasiness with the nature of rabbinic interpretation of the Bible resulted from a defensiveness toward scripturalist Islamic argumentation against the Jews. The subversion or undermin- ing of the Jews' self-image by the Islamic claim that they had distorted God's original message to mankind and failed to keep his "Word" could thus have created a scripturalist reflex of the kind unknown in Judaism prior to the eighth century CE.74 The examination of such arguments in light of recent research on Karaism deepens the problematic nature of the question of influence, which I have already addressed. On the one hand, in shifting the schism forward from the time of 'Anan ben David to that of his great-grandson (namely, from the mid- eighth to the mid-ninth century), Gil's theory works in favor of the priority of Muslim influence. The emended chronology consolidates the claim that the scrip- turalist attestations preserved in the heterodox sources clearly predate the rise of Karaism, thus providing further support for the direction of influence for which Cook argues. On the other hand, as Cook himself emphasizes, the case of Muslim influence on Karaism can only be established on the basis of certain pre- conceptions, the most central of which is "the assumption that scripturalism appeared in Judaism of Islamic times only with 'Anan." Cook comments 73. On the lack of observance on the part of the Jews of the lex talionis and the biblical punish- ment for adultery serving as prime example, see Cook, "'Anan and Islam," 175-80. In Patricia Crone and Michael Cook, Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 30-32, 38, the possibility of the priority of Muslim scripturalism, and hence its formative influence on Karaism, is also advanced. 74. On the Islamic polemic against the Jews, see the section on Karaism in Islamic historiogra- phy herein. 86</page><page sequence="21">Rethinking Karaism further, "This is a defensible assumption. There is no evidence worth the name for the survival of the Sadducee rejection of oral tradition into the Islamic period and no reason to suppose that such a doctrine played any part in the messianic Jewish sects of the Islamic period prior to 'Anan." Elsewhere he states, "Judaism has experienced no significant outbreaks of scripturalism between the Sadducees and modem times other than the Karaite schism itself; and Islam has been similarly free of such schism over most of its history. This suggests that traditionalist reli- gions, though open to scripturalist attack, are not in historical fact at very high risk. Coincidence is thus an improbable interpretation of the simultaneous appearance of fundamentalism in Islam and Judaism."75 It is in this hypothesis that the weak- ness of the arguments in favor of the scripturalist analogy between Shi'ism and Karaism become apparent. There are two aspects to the problem: One concerns the historical evidence, and the other arises from the restricted definition given by Cook (and others) to the phenomenon of scripturalism within Judaism, one that results in an unbalanced comparison with parallel Islamic phenomena. In considering the historical evidence, it is doubtful, in light of recent studies, that scripturalist movements remained completely dormant in Judaism for almost a millennium between the Second Temple and Islamic periods. The eighth-century sectarian unrest associated with figures such as Abii 'Isa al- Isfahanm, though not flagrantly scripturalist, at least as it is depicted by the tenth-century Karaite historiographer Qirqisdni and in Muslim sources, is nonethe- less described by these very same sources as a precursor to Karaism.76 At least one Jewish source, the polemic of Pirkoi ben Baboi attests to a clear scripturalist stance among Jewish groups of the late eighth century.77 With regard to the Qumranites or Sadducees, even if we reject the theory that such ancient Jewish groups had a direct or indirect influence on early Karaism, the comparative work carried out in this respect has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of Karaite halakhah. Some aspects of Karaite law, as expounded in Erder's works, are substantially similar to earlier nonpharisaic modes of Jewish law, not only in their practical conclusion but also in their argumentative chains.78 Therefore, it is not impossible that there were inner-Jewish channels through which such scripturalist trends were passed and carried on. The direction I would like to develop here, however, concerns our use and understanding of the concept of Jewish scripturalism at large and Karaite scripturalism in particular. 75. Cook, "'Anan and Islam," 174-75, 180-81. 76. See note 10 herein. 77. In "'Anan and Islam," Cook nonetheless acknowledges that "the earliest explicit attestation of scripturalism is the denunciation by the Rabbanite polemist Ben Baboi, in the early ninth century, of those who study the Written but deny Oral Torah" (1 n. 1). In a lecture delivered at Tel Aviv University in honor of S. D. Goitein (2001) on the Pirkoi ben Baboi text (first published by L. Ginzberg, Genizah Studies [New York, 1928], 2:571) and its "new version," also found in the Cairo Genizah, (published by B. Levin), Robert Brody has suggested the "new version" is actually the older and that the polemic should be predated to the eighth century. 78. See Erder's overview of his (and earlier) research on comparative aspects of Karaite, Sadducee, and Qumranic halakhah ('Avelei ziyon ha-kara'im, 116-75). 87</page><page sequence="22">Meira Polliack Scripturalism in Judaism is best defined as a fundamentalist religious stance, which endorses a literal-typed, linguistic-contextual interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and rejects a freer, tradition-based, transmitted form of interpretation. This stance appears to have existed in Jewish circles of the first millennium without necessarily crystallizing into an ideological movement or sociopolitical structure. In other words, until the emergence of Karaism, Jewish scripturalism did not mani- fest itself through a defined ideology and an active political agenda that was meant to undermine existing religious establishment. Nevertheless, the exegetical approach that underlies Karaism-an antitraditionalist literalism in the interpret- ation of the Hebrew Bible-was clearly a consistent streak among several Jewish circles of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. These include not only the Sadducees or Qumranites but so-called mainstream rabbinic circles of medakdekim, peshat followers, or ba'alei mikr'a, such as the Masoretes, who were concerned with the analysis of the language and text of the Hebrew Bible.79 If we delimited the concept of Jewish scripturalism only to a clear socio- political manifestation, then Cook would be essentially right in claiming that the Karaites were the only substantial medieval fundamentalist movement akin to that of the Sadducees in ancient times and paralleling the Shi'ites in Islamic times. But this is not what Cook or others claim in this respect. Cook's definition of Islamic scripturalism, for that matter, is not based on sociopolitical criteria but quite rightly on hermeneutic criteria. As is apparent from the scripturalist attesta- tions he provides, Islamic scripturalism in Cook's definition asserts the literal authority of the Qur'an as the only valid source of religious doctrine, rejecting the body of traditions, which are dependent on human transmitters, in which the Qur'an is interpreted nonliterally or arbitrarily. Cook turns, in effect, to Muslim interpretive history to uncover the roots of Islamic scriptural heterodoxy. This methodology is sound, provided that it is applied in the same manner to the com- parative phenomenon under observation, namely, medieval Judaism. Looking to the interpretive history of Islam to establish a certain trend, which eventually takes on a sociopolitical dimension or serves it, inevitably means we have to look to the interpretive history of Judaism when noting a similar trend. The nature of the analogy between Islamic and Jewish scripturalism-and hence the establishment of the direction of influence between them-relies on the balanced analysis of both interpretive histories. Put differently, to uncover the roots of Karaite scripturalism, we need to examine the degree to which this movement relied on "proto-Karaite" literal trends in biblical interpretation. Such trends, in fact, had been known in Jewish tradition since ancient times, just as similar trends in Qur'anic interpretation were apparent in early Islam. More- over, as highlighted by Gil, at least one of the major contingents that forged nascent Karaism came from the heart of the rabbinic establishment, namely, the geonic branch of the House of 'Anan.80 This contingent was deeply accomplished in rabbinic literature and familiar with its variant hermeneutic systems. Early 79. See the section "General Background" herein. 80. See the section "General Background" herein. 88</page><page sequence="23">Rethinking Karaism Karaite literature generally professes such familiarity. It is likely, therefore, that modes of literal interpretation or linguistic-contextual analysis that appear in rabbinic literature, albeit in a limited form, were no less established in the Karaites' consciousness than the literal stance they may have encountered in the relatively recent interpretive history of Islam. Since ancient times (and, in fact, until this very day), there has existed a literal orientation in the study of the Hebrew Bible, particularly the interpretation of its legal corpus. This orientation, known as peshuto shel mikr'a in rabbinic literature and peshat in medieval literature (namely, the simple, straight- forward interpretation of the Bible) coexisted in constant tension with the non- literal orientation, known as midrash/derash (=derivative, homiletic, nonliteral interpretation).81 Throughout rabbinic literature (as preserved in the halakhic and 'aggadic Midrashim, the Mishnah and the Talmudim, dating between the second to the sixth centuries CE), we find instances in which the Sages deliberate as to the pre- ferable approach to the Hebrew Bible. The methodological differences between the famous and opposing rabbinic schools, such as those of Hillel and Shammai (first century BCE) or Akiva and Ishmael (second century CE), as documented in the rabbinic corpus, often revolve around the issue of a nonliteral versus a literal interpretation of biblical law. The debates over the literal application of bib- lical punishment in cases of adultery or lex talionis are prime examples of this tension, which deeply troubled the rabbinic schools.82 These and other examples would have been known to any beginner in Talmudic study or anyone who had a basic familiarity with the rabbinic corpus, not to mention those families (such as 'Anan's) whose sons were accomplished scholars who took an active part in the Jewish higher education system (the yeshivot) of their time and even headed the yeshiva of Palestine well into the ninth century.83 81. Peter Szondi, Introduction to Literary Hermeneutics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 1-13, highlights the coexistence of both orientations in the history of our understanding of texts (the "grammatical-literal" as opposed to the "nonliteral-allegorical"). In his view, they are active simultaneously throughout the history of interpretation, developing in dialectic reaction to one another. The two modes nevertheless rely on contrary procedures in realizing their common urge to overcome the linguistic and historical distance between the interpreter and the sanctified text. The "literal" con- sciously restricts itself to the conceptual world of the text, whereas the "nonliteral" is a more involved form of reading that affords the linguistic sign a new meaning derived from the conceptual world of the interpreter. 82. Various examples of the conflicting orientations of Rabbis Ishmael and Akiva are reported in rabbinic sources; see the famous instance described in the B. Sanhedrin 52b concerning the interpret- ation of the punishment of an adulteress daughter of a priest. For relevant overviews of trends in rabbinic interpretation and the concept of midrash, see, for example, Yishak Heinemann, Darkhei ha-'aggadah (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1970); David Weiss Halivni, Peshat and Derash, Plain and Applied Meaning in Rabbinic Exegesis (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 3-88; David Stern, Midrash and Theory, Ancient Jewish Exegesis and Contemporary Literary Studies (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1997), 15-38; and Jacob Neusner, Invitation to Midrash, The Work- ings of Rabbinic Bible Interpretation (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1998), 1-19; 263-76. 83. See the section "General Background" herein. 89</page><page sequence="24">Meira Polliack Although scripturalist orientation in biblical interpretation has a long- standing history, the dominant inclination of the Tannaim and Amoraim was, nonetheless, toward midrash (nonliteral exegesis), which became the prevalent mode of rabbinic literature. This orientation allowed a more lenient attitude toward the interpretation of biblical law, one that afforded greater freedom and flexibility in mitigating and adapting the basic meaning of the biblical text to the needs of changing times or to preexisting customs and traditions. The concept of Oral Law as a complementary source of divine knowledge helped ground and legitimize midrashic methodology. Nonliteral interpretations, which were always in jeopardy of being undermined by the scriptural authority of the written word, were thus afforded a sound basis deriving from a divine source. This was why Oral Law became so essential a concept to rabbinic reli- gious definition and where it fulfilled a function essentially similar to that of the Sunnah in orthodox Islam. Despite this overriding inclination toward midrash, literal interpretation was inherent to Jewish exegetical thinking, and the problems it raised when it clashed with the methods and practical conclusions of Oral Law were not easily set aside. These continued to undermine the basis of Oral Law, especially throughout the early medieval period, when the rabbinic corpus had reached canonization and Oral Law came to be written down. Maimonides, in fact, explained the rise of Karaism as the result of this cano- nization process,84 which effectively turned midrashic methodology and the concept of Oral Law into the binding, obligatory mode of Jewish interpretive thinking. Interestingly, he, too (no differently to Natronai Gaon who blamed 'Anan and his followers for "creating a Talmud of their own"),85 considered such developments within the Jewish intellectual milieu to have provided the major motivation behind the Karaite rift. As long as tradition remained an oral medium and rabbinic midrash was not elevated to the status of a sanctified inter- pretive system, the Jews were able to accept and mitigate the inherent tensions between literal and nonliteral interpretation. Once Oral Law was unified and cano- nized in the form of the Babylonian Talmud and disseminated and made binding through the authority of the geonim, the subterranean tensions erupted, and a sociopolitical split was inevitable. Even if we do not accept this original Maimonidean explanation for the rise of Karaism, the fact remains that Jewish scripturalism, as an interpretive orien- tation, represents an existing and long-standing feature in Jewish intellectual history that received expression in its leading literary sources and in the live learn- ing traditions of the Hebrew Bible. Those whose professional vocation was the study of rabbinic literature during the Islamic period were apt at applying scriptur- alist argumentation within a legal debate. 'Anan ben David's nonnormative rulings, preserved in his Sefer mizvot (Book of Precepts), made use of scripturalist (contextual) arguments known from rabbinic sources. These rulings 84. See Guide to the Perplexed, beginning of chapter 71, and Yeshayahu Leibovitch's illuminat- ing comment in his book Sihot 'alpirkei 'avot we- al ha-Rambam (Jerusalem: Shoken, 1979), 15-18. 85. See note 39 herein. 90</page><page sequence="25">Rethinking Karaism have long since been recognized as conventional to mainstream halakhic debates of his time, in which differences of opinion furnished many a debate among the geonim. CONCLUSIONS The attestations collated by Cook undoubtedly manifest a literal orientation in eighth-century Islam. By this time, however, Jewish exegesis had a much longer and well-established tradition of literal interpretation. The scripturalist impetus of Karaism was not likely, in my view, to have been primarily kindled by Islamic models or by the Islamic polemic against the Jewish subversion of biblical law. It is more plausible that the deep tensions that prevailed in Jewish hermeneutic thinking and in the medieval learning traditions of the Hebrew Bible reached a point of friction during the Islamic era, wherein they could not be held together anymore, not even loosely. The question that should be asked, therefore, is not whether Islam influenced Jewish scripturalism, but rather, why did Jewish scripturalism become so accentu- ated in the Islamic era, reaching the point of no return, whence it sought expression as a central part of the ideology of a new sociopolitical movement? The role of Islam in the crystallization of Karaism lies not, it seems, in providing an incentive for Jewish scripturalism as an interpretive orientation or in blazing the trail to a fundamentalist antitraditionalist religious option. Both of these paths were inherent in Jewish intellectual history and fairly latent in Jewish messianic thought. Rather, it was in the sphere of public life that Islam introduced a new language that was unknown to Judaism and of considerable influence on it. The melding of religion and politics emblematic to the Islamic Empire and its attempts, from the eighth century onward, to codify and unify Islamic law and religious practices as a means of establishing political power deeply effected the Jews. The geonim's endeavors to unify Jewish religious practices and to consoli- date their role as binding religious authorities were in part a reaction to the unified world of Islam, and they were conceived as a means of self-preservation and reor- ganization of Jewish religious identity under this towering new force. It is in light of these developments that dormant circles opposed to the traditionalist orientation of rabbinic religion found their opportunity for self-expression, reflecting the same anticentripetal motivation expressed by heterodox Islam. During the ninth through eleventh centuries, the scripturalist ethos contin- ued to serve as the focus of Karaite self-definition and as the major catalyst behind the Karaites' opposition to traditionalist Judaism. They chose to pursue and develop a literal orientation in biblical interpretation that was marginalized in Jewish literature because of the overpowering force of rabbinic midrash. In my view, the Karaites' prime motivation came from their deep knowledge and dia- logue with rabbinic interpretive tradition and less from their encounter with a similar trend in contemporary Islam. The Karaites' knowledge of Arabic, particu- larly in the early stages of their movement, was limited. Some of them, such as al-Quimisi, attempted to write commentaries in Hebrew, and others, such as Yefet, openly professed their limited control of Arabic and chose to write in this 91</page><page sequence="26">Meira Polliack medium because it provided more flexibility in expressing their exegetical thought and wider access to their audience. The Hebrew name they chose for themselves, kara'im, emphasized their scholarly association with grammatical and masoretic circles, known as ba 'alei mikr'a, that cultivated an expertise in biblical study as opposed to the specialist study of the Aggadah, Mishnah, and Talmud.86 Finally, at the core, Karaite scripturalism was deeply inspired by Jewish messian- ism and represented an ideological response to the state of Jewish exile. In this scheme, literal interpretation was perceived as the means of reversing the state of mistake inaugurated by nonliteral (midrashic) interpretation, the matrix of Oral Law-and hence a means of rectifying Jewish religious life-and conse- quently enhancing the possibility of national salvation and independence. Yefet's introduction to his commentary on Exodus is yet another source in which several of the previously mentioned motivations may be gleaned:87 It is incumbent upon whoever reads our book that he should not criticize our words in the Arabic language for it is not our language,88 but fix his intention on the meanings and objectives (=of our commentary), so that if he learns a useful lesson, he should not divert it from its path, and if he comes across any mistake or inattention may he excuse it, for exile is like darkness and the shadow-of-death and men walk in it like the blind, as it is said (Isaiah 59:10): "We grope for the wall like the blind." This is the state of the scholars of the exile from the time in which the Prophets are absent, as he said (Isaiah 29:10): "For the Lord has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the Prophets," and he said (29:14) "and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish." At the end of exile, however, there awakened a people who fixed their intention upon the Lord of the Universe, and they did not seek knowledge for the purpose of (political) leadership in this world, rather their quest was to attain the truths (= of Scripture) and to comply with them in all their might, as they said (Psalm 119:35): "Lead me in the path of thy com- mandments."89 And when the Lord of the Universe perceived their intention he opened their eyes and showed them the way to most of the truths, and they wrote books and taught pupils and they did not become stingy with their knowledge, as it is said (Isaiah 50:4): "The Lord God has given me a tongue of those who teach, that I may know to sustain with a word he who is weary." And we-the most junior of their pupils-have continued from them, and we trace back to them what we have heard concerning this, as it is said (Psalm 40:11): "I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart... do not thou, O Lord, withhold thy mercies from me."

This upheaval was experienced by the geonic elites themselves, particularly among the leading religious forces and distinctive legal traditions of Palestine and Babylonia. To this may be added the dissatisfaction of far-flung local communities who took pride in their own customs and learning traditions. This reorganization, which was largely forced upon the Jewish diasporas, resulted mainly from the geonims' response to the unifying force witnessed in Islam. Certainly other factors also contributed to the rise of Karaism. The appear- ance of a parallel trend that questioned oral tradition in Islam could well have been one of them, alongside the possible rediscovery by the Karaites of ancient, antirab- binic Jewish texts (such as those from Qumran), or the fermenting of messianic and nationalist hopes in the Jewish Persian sphere. In my view, the major intellec- tual impetus of the Karaite movement nevertheless lies in the inner dynamic of Jewish interpretive history and derives from the learning traditions of the Hebrew Bible that were prevalent in the Jewish Orient of pre-Islamic and early Islamic times. In the richness, variety, and pluralism of these existing traditions, as is gradually being uncovered and recognized, lies the main key to understand- ing the emergence of Karaism at the major crossroad between Judaism and Islam.
