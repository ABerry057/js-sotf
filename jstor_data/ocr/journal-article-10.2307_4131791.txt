<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel M. Swetschinski. Reluctant Cosmopolitans: The Portuguese Jews of Seven- teenth-CenturyAmsterdam. London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2000. xiv, 380 pp. When Daniel Swetschinski's dissertation appeared in 1980, it immediately became an indispensable work. It was a wide-ranging, clearly-ordered synthesis of scholarship on the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam in the seven- teenth-century, incorporating some important original research. It surveyed the community's legal, demographic, economic, and institutional history, with a brief chapter on certain aspects of its cultural life. Its most original contribution was a detailed study of demographic data gleaned from the Amsterdam puyboecken, the municipal registers of intended marriages. On the basis of these records, Swet- schinski charted in detail the immigration to Amsterdam of ex-conversos with ori- gins in the Iberian Peninsula. His examination of the community's institutional life relied to a considerable extent on existing studies in Dutch, but also incorporated his own archival work, and it raised important questions about the structure of the community. Moreover, at a time when this was the exception rather than the rule, it dealt with the Portuguese Jews in an unsentimental, unromanticized fashion. The dissertation was far from exhaustive-a task beyond the reach of any young schol- ar-but it was a valuable contribution to Jewish communal history. Reluctant Cosmopolitans draws heavily in structure and contents from this dissertation. To be sure, the book reflects an effort to rethink and update, but it is not a new work, and does not seriously take into account the scholarship of the last two decades. This is not entirely apparent from the bibliography, which lists im- portant recent works, however, in the text itself, Swetschinski tends to draw on these works (if at all) only vaguely, and without attribution. The first chapter, on the history of toleration in seventeenth-century Nether- lands, is a simplified treatment of a complex topic. Much has been done on this topic since Joseph Lecler and Henry Kamen wrote their seminal books in the 1960s. Thanks to recent work in this area by scholars like Jonathan Israel, Nico- lette Mout, Martin van Gelderen, and Benjamin Kaplan, we possess a relatively nuanced and ramified view of the vicissitudes of toleration in the Netherlands, in opinion and practice. None of this work is cited in Swetschinski's footnotes, nor does he make use of it to refine the chapter conceptually. The core of Chapter Two, an examination of immigration to Amsterdam, is 149</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Swetschinski's study of the puyboeken-a painstaking and valuable piece of re- search. But here, as elsewhere, in the book, the failure to use a wider range of sources leads to problems of interpretation. For example, Swetschinski infers- though he has no data on unmarried men and women-that there was a shortage of marriageable women in the early community, and concludes that the Dotar dowry society was established "for the specific purpose" of furthering the migra- tion of single women to remedy the imbalance (pp. 85-88, 100, 180). However, a look at the Dotar records-not to mention existing research-would have shown that the society was not designed to do this, nor did it further such an aim. Of the 68 young women who received dowries in the first twenty-five years of the soci- ety's existence, 38 were already living in the Amsterdam/Hamburg area. Only a very few of the other 30 migrated to Amsterdam, if they migrated at all. (At least one recipient migrated out of Amsterdam, to Izmir). When data is so abundant, it is risky to draw conclusions based on inferences. Chapters Three through Six deal with topics that have been studied exten- sively by a handful of competent scholars in the last two decades: Portuguese- Jewish commerce, the institutional history of the community, conflict within the community, and Portuguese-Jewish cultural formation, respectively. The author makes some use of notarial and communal records, and wide use of indispensable older secondary works, but without a persuasive new perspective or an attempt to integrate new research and/or secondary literature, these chapters are of limited value. Especially problematic is the somewhat bewildering Conclusion, which deals with issues of identity, ethnicity, and memory. Here, Swetschinski chooses to locate his own thinking in relation to that of other scholars-or rather, of an un- likely few. I hope it does not detract from the respect due to Carl Gebhardt (Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa, 1922) and Yitzhak Baer (Galut, 1936) to point out that their work has long been superseded on such matters. In any case, Swetschin- ski's conclusion, rather than providing a satisfying ending to the book, seems a half-hearted attempt to move into a new arena in which he is not very comfortable. There are occasional misstatements that suggest an uncertain grasp, or that may simply be careless generalizations. Let me mention a few. It was not "to in- terrogate [the] converts" that the Inquisition was established (p. 4). Amsterdam's Portuguese Jews were surely not "the first Jews to create a significant body of re- ligious and secular literature" (p. 5). The knowledge of "matters religious" among conversos in the Peninsula cannot be characterized as "probably perfunctory across the board," nor does it make sense to cite Jean-Pierre Dedieu in support of such a generalization (p. 174 n. 26). Moses Mendelssohn was far too sophisticated to have regarded the Portuguese Jews collectively as "in some sense exemplary" (p. 318, and cf. p. 316; no sources cited). Swetschinski does not explicitly refer to his book as a social history, though he strongly suggests it belongs in that category (pp. 5, 271). It would better be de- scribed as communal history, a venerable genre in Jewish historiography. To do him justice, Swetschinski offers occasional glimpses of his ability to use archival data imaginatively to illuminate social life. He uses the puyboecken, for example, to obtain figures on female illiteracy (p. 89); he tells a story of richesse oblige with 150</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews his data on refusal to serve on the Mahamad, and its penalties (pp. 192-94); he ex- tracts from the puyboecken and notarial records indirect evidence about Sabbath observance (pp. 215-16). But we have still seen only the tip of the iceberg, and the archives await. Miriam Bodian Pennsylvania State University Merion Station, Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
