New York: New York University Press, 1993. xiii, 424 pp. Turkey's role in events connected with the Holocaust, such as the rescue of Jews and Jewish immigration to Palestine, has been mentioned in numerous studies. The great majority of them, however, discuss specific areas in which Turkey generally appears to have played a reactive or passive part. The book under review is the first attempt to present a comprehensive picture of Turkey's activities from a Turkish perspective and based primarily on hitherto-unused Turkish sources. Stanford Shaw, professor of Turkish and Judeo-Turkish history at the University of California in Los Angeles, is a foremost scholar in the field of Turkish history and the author of numerous books and articles, including The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic (New York, 1991). Shaw's main argument is that Turkey, a country that remained neutral during most of World War II and whose territory was never occupied by the Axis, was not a major actor in the events surrounding the Holocaust, but that its role was far from insignificant and passive. On the contrary, under the weight of events, Turkey was forced to formulate policies and pursue an active role, especially in matters that affected its own Jewish citizens. The book deals with three broad subjects: the condition of Turkish Jewry during World War II, Turkey's role in the transfer of mostly illegal immigrants to Palestine, and Turkey's attempts to protect and rescue Jews, mostly Turkish citizens, in Nazi-occupied France. During the period from Hitler's rise to power in 1933 to the outbreak of World War II, the most noteworthy event from the perspective of this book's topic was Turkey's admission of hundreds of refugee scholars and scientists, many of them Jews, who had fled Nazi Germany and Austria. Turkey was at the time in the process of modernizing its higher educational system, and the refugee scholars, whose number included many of the most prominent persons in their fields, helped develop and modernize Turkey's universities. They also established and directed new research institutions. The absorption of hundreds of scholars, most of whom were unfamiliar with the Turkish language or with living conditions in Turkey, was not an easy task, as Shaw documents. Many of the refugees accepted Turkish citizenship when it was offered to them. Others, however, preferred to move on, after a while, to other countries, with some continuing their careers on the campuses of</page><page sequence="2">462 BOOK REVIEWS well-known American universities. The experiment proved highly beneficial to both parties; Turkey was able to modernize its academic institutions and enrich its cultural life in several important areas, while for most of the refugee scholars the Turkish haven provided an escape from certain death and an opportunity to continue with their professional careers. When World War II broke out, Turkey was in an unusual situation. Before the war it had concluded defensive agreements with both France and Britain, mainly against Italian and German expansionism. Turkey had entered these agreements on the assumption of Soviet friendliness, in view of Moscow's strong opposition to Fascism and Nazism. But the German-Soviet pact of August 1939 and later the Italian and German advances in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and North Africa left Turkey increasingly isolated from its nominal allies and exposed to the full might of Axis power established along its borders. In order to avoid provoking a German invasion, Turkey maintained an uneasy neutrality while mobilizing a large army of one million men. Turkey's position as a neutral power enabled her to maintain diplomatic representation throughout Nazi-occupied Europe and to serve as a major listening post for developments there. Because Turkey's strategic position was highly valued by the Allies as well as the Axis, both sides turned the country into an arena for propaganda, political maneuvering, and espionage activities. It was within this context that Istanbul emerged as one of the most important centers for Jewish rescue operations. The book details the activities of the various Jewish organizations involved in these operations, their internal rivalries, and their contacts with the Turkish authorities and representatives of the major powers. In spite of closed frontiers, Jewish refugees from Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and even Holland were able to reach Turkey by boat, train, and on foot. There were a number of tragic disasters, the worst of which was the sinking of the Struma in the Black Sea in February 1942, with the loss of 769 Jewish refugees from Romania. In spite of this and other tragic incidents, Shaw concludes that during the war years, 16,474 "official" Jewish refugees passed through Turkey in addition to approximately 75,000 others who entered the country illegally. Most of these refugees continued their journey to Palestine, legally or illegally, by sea or overland through Syria. A separate section describes the rescues of Jews by Turkish diplomats in Greece. Turkish consular officials were able to protect Jews who had valid</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 463 Turkish citizenship papers. In some cases Turkish consuls issued papers to Jews whose Turkish citizenship had lapsed. In July 1944, on the island of Rhodes, the Turkish consul, Selahattin Ulktimen, at great personal risk, was able to save from deportation to extermination camps a group of forty-two Jews, including Turkish citizens as well as spouses and relatives who were not Turkish citizens. In January 1945, the Germans permitted the group to be evacuated to Turkey. In 1989, Ulkiimen was honored by Yad Vashem as a "Righteous Gentile." The largest part of the book, however, and herein lies its most important contribution, deals with rescue operations by Turkish diplomats in France. This part of the book is based primarily on the hitherto-unutilized archives of the Turkish embassy and consulate-general in Paris, as well as on the Turkish Foreign Ministry archives in Ankara. Since 1864, the Paris-based Alliance Isra61ite Universelle had conducted wide-ranging educational and cultural activities among the Jews of the Ottoman Empire, and these continued in republican Turkey until the mid- 1920s. On the eve of the First World War, about 35 percent of all school-age Jewish children living in areas within the borders of present-day Turkey attended Alliance schools, where French was the language of instruction. For this and other reasons, since the end of the nineteenth century France had become a preferred destination of emigration for many Turkish Jews. According to Turkish consular records, at the start of World War II, some 10,000 Turkish Jews lived in France among a total Jewish population of about 300,000. (According to German documents, in September 1942, 3,046 Turkish Jews remained in Paris alone, after many had fled, mainly to unoccupied southern France.) These numbers did not include Turkish Jews who had become French citizens and allowed their Turkish citizenship to lapse. Shaw estimates that another 10,000 Jews who were Turkish citizens in good standing lived in other West European countries. As representatives of a neutral power whose friendship was valued by Berlin and Vichy France, Turkish diplomats and consular officials were in a position to protect their nationals. Several factors, however, made the task difficult. In the first place, the German occupation authorities did not differ- entiate between Jews on the basis of nationality, while Vichy tended to treat "foreign" Jews, including those who had recently become French citizens, with greater severity than native-born or long-established French Jews. Also, due to war conditions, several Turkish consulates in occupied Europe had</page><page sequence="4">464 BOOK REVIEWS to be closed. In France, only the consulates in Paris, Lyon, and Marseilles (transferred to Grenoble in 1942) remained open. Additionally, the Germans generally conducted their anti-Jewish operations-arrests, roundups, depor- tations to extermination camps-with abruptness and arbitrariness. These circumstances made it difficult for Turkish Jews to contact the consulates and for the latter to intervene in time. Following the fall of France, many Jews began applying to Turkish consulates for certificates of Turkish citizenship, and this became a major preoccupation for consular personnel. Among the applicants there were many whose Turkish citizenship had lapsed. The Ankara government was at first reluctant to help them, fearing German reprisals. However, in the face of mounting appeals from Jewish leaders in Turkey, the United States, and Britain, the government changed its position in early 1942. Consulates were ordered to place Jews whose citizenship had lapsed in a special category as "irregular citizens" (gayri muntazam vatandaglar), and to provide them with official protection until the completion of the formal procedures for the restoration of their citizenship. Shaw provides detailed documentary evidence of Turkish diplomatic intervention to prevent the application of anti-Jewish laws against Turkish Jews. Specifically, the Turkish consuls intervened to prevent arrests and deportations of Jews to concentration camps in Eastern Europe and to protect Jewish property from confiscation. As a result of repeated Turkish protests, in February 1941 the German authorities in Paris informed the Turkish consulate that they were prepared to make exceptions with regard to Turkish Jews. Indeed, by May 1941 the Turkish consul-general in Paris could report to his superiors that the Germans were releasing arrested Jews who had Turkish citizenship. But the attitude of the German and French authorities hardened as the war continued. In November 1942, the Germans began to investigate closely the Turkish "certificates of citizenship" and immediately deported for extermination any Jew whose Turkish citizenship had lapsed or was in question. Also, in September 1943 the German authorities in Paris informed the Turkish consulate that they would release Turkish Jews only if guarantees were provided that these persons would be immediately repatriated to Turkey. Indeed, as of 1943 the Turkish consulates began organizing the repatriation of Turkish Jews to Turkey in groups. During 1943 and 1944 about 1,000 Turkish Jews left for Turkey by sea from southern France. During the spring and summer of 1943 three groups left by train from Paris, involving in</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 465 one case 200 persons and in another fifteen families. Between February and May 1944, another eight groups, totaling 414 persons, left by train from Paris. Smaller groups also departed from Brussels. In early 1944, the Turkish Foreign Ministry, at the intercession of the Jewish Agency and the U.S. embassy in Ankara, was able to prevail on Vichy France to abandon plans to deport to extermination camps some 10,000 "Levantine" Jews believed to be former Turkish citizens. Although Shaw does not offer total numbers, it is evident that the activities of Turkish diplomats in France saved thousands of Jewish lives. Shaw's book contains much new information and offers new perspectives on several important issues, and it is, therefore, a valuable addition to the literature on the Holocaust. The reader should be cautioned, however, that in spite of some initial statements to the effect that Turkey was not a major actor in the events surrounding the Holocaust, the author in fact goes on to overstate the significance of Turkey's actions and the humanitarian motives behind them. Perhaps this is unavoidable in a study that focuses on Turkey, but more balance and pespective would have strengthened the case that Shaw is trying to make. Also, the narrative includes a large number of excessively lengthy, unedited excerpts from official documents, correspondence, and the like, which are, at times, repetitive and make it difficult to follow the main argument. Additionally, the book contains an inordinate number of typographical errors and does not have an index. In spite of these shortcomings, this is an important work that no serious student of the Holocaust can ignore. Avigdor Levy Brandeis University Waltham, Mass.</page></plain_text>
