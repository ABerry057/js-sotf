<plain_text><page sequence="1">112 BOOK REVIEWS Shuly Rubin Schwartz. The Emergence of Jewish Scholarship in America: The Publication of the Jewish Encyclopedia. Monographs of the Hebrew Union College, no. 13. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1991. xii, 235 pp. If there is more to be said about the Jewish Encyclopedia (12 vols. 1901-1905) as event, resource, or symptom, I can't imagine what it might be. Shuly Rubin Schwartz tells us about its conception by Isidor(e) Singer, its adoption by Funk and Wagnalls, the operations of its editorial board (including conflicts over matters of interpretation and personality, with helpful biographical sketches of all the board members), the manner of its composition, the structure of its financing, its reception by reviewers (generally favorable) and the public (who didn't buy enough copies to make the project profitable), its reputation and continuing usefulness, as well as what it says. Most important, she does what could not have been done fifty, or forty, or even thirty years ago, when encyclopedias were not acceptable "sources," i.e., not real scholarship: She treats it seriously as a made thing, a conscientious attempt to make sense out of the world as defined in particular ways at a particular time and from a particular point of view, with the same "reliability" (and the same "unreliability") as Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution (1913). That is a peculiarly "postmodern" point of view, in its unwillingness either to stand on the shoulders of our scholarly predecessors or to drive their faces into the mud, and this reviewer finds it particularly welcome- and appropriate-for the discussion of a project in which this very issue, of the validity of "traditional" sources of Jewish knowledge and knowledge about Jews and Jewish life, whether of rabbinic or "modem" origins, was joined. In general, Schwartz argues, the authors of the Jewish Encyclopedia treated their subjects as matters of belief and interpretation rather than of truth (and even the matter of "truth" as a matter of belief and interpretation). For some this approach derived from their commitment to the "modernization" of Judaism as a system of belief and ritual. For some it derived from their commitment to the methods of Wissenschaft des Judentums, i.e., of Judaism as Phenomenon, "one among many" ancient, medieval, modern systems of belief, ritual (and polity). For some it derived from their commitment to universalism (the analogue of contemporary</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 113 internationalism), in which Judaism stood either as the Ur religion or as the modal religion. For some it derived from an acknowledgment that they were writing at once for Jews and non-Jews, that the Jews disagreed among themselves, and that this disagreement was legitimate even if some persons were right and some were wrong, but that even the fact of disagreement demonstrated that Jews and Judaism were one thing in its numerous variations. ("Sensitive" or "disputed" issues were routinely covered in more than one article, reflecting different points of view.) For some-Schwartz examines in detail the contributions of Jacob Lauterbach, explicitly intended to counteract the "reform" interpretations of Kaufmann Kohler and thereby to satisfy "traditionalists" on the board of editors like Solomon Schechter and Cyrus Adler-it derived less from intention, ideology, or practical necessity than from "the spirit of the age" (my phrase, not hers). But unlike the contemporary authors of the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911), whose apparent commitment was to telling the one and single truth, the authors of the Jewish Encyclopedia reflect the essentially modernist recognition of a pluralism of points of view and of truths, including those which change across time according to their usefulness as well as those which change across time in light of new knowledge. And thus also, although Schwartz does not say so, the Jewish Encyclopedia effectively transcended its roots in the scientific positivism of the late nineteenth century (including Wissenschaft des Judentums) and became a symptomatic document of the new age of which America itself soon became the emblem. Were the Jewish Encyclopedia no more than a summary of the "best" scholarship of its age, it would be worth the careful examination Schwartz gives it, to know what they knew, what issues they addressed. But in addition, its editorial board comprised the leading lights of Jewish scholarship at the turn of the century. In addition to Adler, Kohler, and Schechter, and Singer himself, Gotthard Deutsch, Louis Ginzberg, Richard Gottheil, Emil G. Hirsch, Marcus Jastrow, Morris Jastrow, Frederic de Sola Mendes, William Popper, Herman Rosenthal, and the Harvard semiticists George Foot Moore and Crawford Howell Toy all served for varying lengths of time. Out of their (sometimes uneasy) collaboration on this project, Schwartz reminds us, came the experience necessary for subsequent collaborations-most notably the Bible translation project of the Jewish Publication Society-but even more important, their several personal recognitions of the possibility of</page><page sequence="3">114 BOOK REVIEWS Jewish scholarship in America. It is the recognition which justifies the title of this volume, and makes the Jewish Encyclopedia not only a document illuminating its own time, but an event in the history of ours. Henry D.
