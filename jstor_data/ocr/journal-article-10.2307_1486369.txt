<plain_text><page sequence="1">KETIAH BAR SHALOM by HOWARD JACOBSON As far as we know, the rabbis were not well acquainted with Latin, but there are occasional examples in rabbinic literature of their ability to formu- late or understand bilingual (Hebrew-Latin) puns. In Midrash Tanlhuma,' for instance, there is a play on Latin corona/Hebrew qeren, and, according to an observation attributed to Yehoshua Guttman, at B.T. Ta'anit 29a on Latin nasi (nasus)/Hebrew nasi. The talmudic anecdote quoted below can be best understood when we perceive the Latin wordplay on which it is built. What is this story about Ketiah Bar Shalom? A Roman emperor who hated the Jews asked the following of the important members of the govern- ment: "A man who has a growth on his foot-should he cut it off (mi she-'alah lo nima be-raglo yiqle'ennah) and live in comfort or leave it alone and suffer?" They answered, "He should cut it off (yiqle'ennah) and live in comfort." Ketiah Bar Shalom then spoke, "First of all, you can not overcQme them all. [For it is written, "I have spread you out like the four winds ..." (Zech. 2:10) which signifies that just as the world can not exist without the winds, so it can not exist without Israel]. In addition, people will call you a mutilating king- dom (ve-'od qeru lakh malkhuta qalti'a)." The emperor replied, "You have spoken well. However, anyone who bests the emperor must be thrown into the furnace." When they were leading Ketiah away, a lady said to him, "woe for the ship that sails without paying the tax!" He then fell upon his foreskin and cut it off (qat'ah). "I have paid the tax," he declared. "Now I pass on." As he 1. Midrash Tanbuma, ed.

[Rabbi Akiba explained this in accord with the verse, "and it shall be for Aaron and his sons" (Exod. 29:28)-half to Aaron and half to his sons]. A heavenly voice then declared, "Ketiah Bar Shalom is summoned to life in the world to come." Rabbi wept and said, "Some people acquire eternity in one hour, others after years."2 It is reasonable to assume that there is a kernel of historical truth in the above quoted tale about Ketiah Bar Shalom. Some scholars have even attempted to identify Ketiah and the very circumstances of the episode: the emperor is Domitian; the Roman hero is the consul Flavius Clemens who may have had judaizing tendencies.3 Domitian, it is true, was no friend of the Jews, but our information on the affair of Flavius does not jibe very well with the details of the Ketiah story. Flavius is executed on the charge of neglecting the gods, Ketiah for upstaging the emperor. Flavius's affiliation with Judaism (assuming there was such) preceded his condemnation and was presumably its cause, while Ketiah's followed his condemnation and was presumably its result. A careful examination of the rabbinic text will suggest the nature of the historical episode and that in turn may provide us a clue as to the period and emperor involved. The main elements of the story are: 1. an emperor viewed as anti- Semitic; 2. a play on words that involves a name and the concepts of sur- 2. B.T.

Those who have maintained this identification include Heinrich Gr n tz, "Jidisch-geschichtliche Studien," Monatsschrift far Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums S(1852): 196-202 (see also Geschichte der Juden, 4th ed., I11 vols. in 13 [Leipzig, 1899-1911], 4:1 Ill , 402-3); Joseph Derenbourg, Essai sur I'histoire et la ge~ographie de la Palestine (Paris, 1867), pp. 335-36; Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v.

Joseph Kobak, "Adarkhan u-Qe i'ah bar Shalom," Jeschurun 8 (1875): 16 1-70 (Hebrew sec.), rejected Grtz's view and suggested that the emperor is Septimius Severus. His argument relies on forced interpretations, emendations of the text and excisions.</page><page sequence="3">KETIAH BAR SHALOM 41 gery, destruction and circumcision; 3. the act of circumcision. Now it is at once apparent that the Latin conversation at the court of the emperor could not produce a verbal battle of wits in Aramaic. Why then did the rabbis decide to make the heart of the story a fictional war of puns? The reason may be simple. The version that the rabbis knew of the events at the court included a Latin play on words. They then adapted it as best as they could in Aramaic. The basic structure is as follows: Emperor: mi she-'alah lo nima be-raglo yiqte'ennah . Ketiah: qeru lakh malkhuta qatti'a We can reconstruct the Latin dialogue: Emperor: qui tumorem in pede habet, caedat (a man who has a growth on his foot-should he cut it off.?) Ketiah: [si hoc feceris], Caesar caesor appellaberis (if you do this, you will be called a murderous emperor) The rabbis were able to maintain the wordplay by inventing the name Ketiah for the Roman official. Caedo is used to denote the surgical removal of a growth at Juvenal 2:13; caesor is attested in the sense "murderer" at Gloss. 2.472.45. The extension of qi' to refer to circumcision produces the equivalent of the Latin compound of caedo, circumcidere. In short, caedo involves the concepts of surgery, destruction and circumcision and is the verbal root of the name Caesar.4 Thus, the rabbis ingeniously transposed the whole complex of Latin paranomasia here into Aramaic.5 Can this reconstruction help us identify the emperor? Perhaps. On the basis of the narrative we can say that he was considered hostile to the Jews, enjoyed playing with language and imagery, and did not like to be upstaged. One emperor fits this description well-Hadrian. His relationship with the Jews and their attitude toward him need no rehearsing. Our biographical sources inform us that he prided himself on his use of language, that he 4. Our editions at 'Avodah Zarah 10b read (x~yup) n"rup xmnai (cf. Yalqut Makhiri, Zech. 2:10; Yalqut Shim'oni, Ezek. 373 has mnyPi). I assume ,;rmup (Ktup) is active in sense, not pas- sive, "mutilating" rather than "mutilated," though it would make little difference to my interpretation. If passive, the Aramaic pun would be slightly different in sense from the Latin though based on the same wordplay. The oldest complete manuscript of 'Avodah Zarah (pub- lished by Shraga Abramson, New York, 1957) in fact reads 't,uip xS which is then exactly Caesar caesor. 5. Another example of the rabbis transposing a pun from one language into another probably occurs in Mishnah 'Avot where Raanana Meridor has argued ("A Greek Play on Words in the Mishna?," Scripta Classica Israelica 1 [1974]: 131) that the expression "when I have leisure I shall study" (li-khe-she-'eppaneh 'eshneh) reproduces a Greek pun built around the multiple meanings of scholi (leisure, study).</page><page sequence="4">42 HOWARD JACOBSON indulged in writing poetry and that he had a good wit. In addition, he desired to surpass everyone in everything and was envious and hateful of those who excelled. We even hear that he executed a man who outwitted him.6 Two more points may support this identification: 1. An important ele- ment of the Ketiah story is circumcision. It was during Hadrian's reign that circumcision became a bitter battleground for the Jews when the emperor forbade it.' 2. In the story, the leader of the Jews appears to be Rabbi Akiba (note rabbi 'Aqiva va-haverav).8 Again, this best suits the period of Hadrian.9 Department of the Classics University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Urbana, IL 61801 6. For the biographical data see Dio 69.3-4, HA 15.10-16.6, 20.7-8, 21.3. 7. Rabbi Akiba is involved in another story that centers around circumcision at Tanhuma, Tazri'a 5. 8. M.D. Herr, "Sibbotav shel mered Bar Kokhva," Zion 43 (1978): 1-11, has recently argued that Hadrian's ban on circumcision preceded and precipitated the Jewish revolt. 9. Elements of the Ketiah story occur elsewhere in rabbinic texts. At Deut. Rab. 2.24 we read of a Roman senator who committed suicide to save the Jews and circumcised himself before dying. The phrase (,tyup) nlnu mp xn'~ occurs in a Roman-Jewish confrontation at B.T. Pesalhim 87b and Yalqut Shim'oni Shofetim 50. 1 do not see any fruitful connections to be made.
