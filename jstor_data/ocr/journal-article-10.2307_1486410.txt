By the 1880s, Reform Judaism had become the preemi- nent form of Judaism in both institutional growth and organizational cohesiveness; it remained the favored religious pattern of the elite leadership of American Jewry well into the twentieth century. For its part, Unitarian- ism by the 1880s had spread beyond the confines of New England, featured a revitalized Western branch, the Western Unitarian Conference, and was experiencing an articulate denominational consciousness. As the major institutional and liberal expressions of Judaism and Chris- tianity, both Reform Judaism and Unitarianism shared much in common.

They affirmed their respective religions' consonance with reason and progress, and underscored the relevance of their interpretations of Judaism and Christianity for the modern secular age. Not surprisingly, therefore, a growing number of Reform Jewish and Unitarian intellectuals acknowledged each other's thinking and activities, resulting in varied lines of religious communication and social interaction between them. While generally restricted to clergy, scholars of religion, and the more educated laymen, this rapprochement between Jewish and Christian reli- gious liberals was nonetheless seen and felt by the general public. The last third of the nineteenth century, for example, witnessed the innovation of pulpit exchanges between Reform rabbis and Unitarian ministers and the exchange of newspaper subscriptions between editors of Jewish and Unitar- ian newspapers. Religious leaders in both the Reform and Unitarian camps seemed to share a common eschatological vision; they often preached on the imminent arrival of a "religion of humanity," characterized by the belief in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man, which would usher in an era of religious universalism. On a sociopolitical level, Reform Jewish leaders joined forces with Unitarians and other liberals on communal and national levels to promote the complete separation of church and state in America and to protest any perceived, practical negation of that principle. And yet, despite this developing social and religious interaction with its seemingly similar ideal of the religious future, despite a shared political value which advocated a nonsectarian democratic America, the attitude of Reform Jewish thinkers to Unitarianism seems to have been deeply ambiva- lent.' On the one hand, Reform Jews seem to have recognized Unitarians as their most important allies in the fight for religious liberty against the forces of sectarianism and evangelical Christian conservatism. They acknowledged the vital religious progress which Unitarians had made in having cast aside time-honored Christian creeds and dogmas. Nevertheless, the sincere rap- 1.

For one thing, Reform Jewish thinkers and their Unitarian counterparts confronted each other with antithetical claims of religious triumphalism. They each sought to iden- tify their own religion with the "religion of humanity." Commitments to ultimate religious universalism notwithstanding, the religious leaders of each denomination clung to an ideology that justified the separate social and religious existence of their respective religions. Thus when in the 1870s and 1880s Unitarianism increasingly began to be viewed by both some Jews and Christians as identical to Reform Judaism, Reform rabbis quickly moved to underline the fundamental differences and sharpen the somewhat blurred distinction between the two faiths. Adherence to an ideology of reli- gious universalism was not to be equated or confused with the dissolution of contemporary Jewish social and religious life. This Reform ambivalence to Unitarianism, and liberal Christianity in general, finds dramatic expression in the career and writings of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise. Indefatigable champion of American Reform Judaism, archi- tect of its major institutions in the nineteenth century, and editor of the influential (American) Israelite, Wise came into frequent contact with the religious elite of American liberal Christianity. Because of his pivotal role in the history of American Reform Judaism, because of his relations with Uni- tarians and his written analyses of Unitarianism, and because of his desire to win respect for Jews and Judaism especially from liberal Christians, Isaac M. Wise serves as an excellent figure through whom one may reveal both the scope and the limitations of liberal Jewish-Christian rapprochement in nine- teenth century America. His evolving opinions on Unitarianism and interac- tions with Unitarians, though reflecting his personal temperament, char- acter, style, and religious ideology, nonetheless can be regarded as paradig- matic of the broad liberal Jewish-Christian interchange at this time.2 Wise on Christianity Isaac Mayer Wise devoted much of his active life to a vigorous repudia- 2.

Early on in his rabbinic career, he identified the two fundamental enemies of Judaism to be "nihilism" and "Christianity in all its sects." Arguing "that we have no advocates powerful enough to meet our adversaries," the pugnacious and irascible Wise set out to lock horns with the "opponents of Judaism from what quarter they ever may come" and "to attack them from [a] thousand sides."3 From his voluminous writ- ings, however, it seems apparent that, of the two opponents, Wise consi- dered dogmatic Christianity and its orthodox adherents to be the main detractors of Judaism. In response to the multifarious activities of Christian writers, ministers, and missionaries who proclaimed the superiority of Christianity over Judaism, he energetically affirmed the integrity, viability, and future glory of American Judaism.4 Wise perceived a religious triumphalism in mainstream Christianity which equated all religious truth with its own doctrines, which characterized all morality and examples of human virtue as Christian, and which asserted that all humanity would one day become Christian. This triumphalism was also channeled into the social-political arena. Thus, Wise, an ardent sup- porter of a nonsectarian American democratic republic, found himself regularly inveighing against Protestant groups which tried to introduce or 3. Letter of Isaac M.

This took on a dual character. On the one hand, believing that-in his words-the best defense is a good offense,6 he critically analyzed and denigrated the origins and development of Christianity in order to demonstrate its untenability for both the modern age and the future "religion of humanity."7 He never failed to underscore the irrationality of Christian theological dogmas, the lack of any novel religious contributions on Christianity's part, and its historic opposition to reason, human freedom and scientific progress. Whatever was religiously true and valid in Christianity was borrowed from Judaism, Wise often observed, and whatever idea or value was not Jewish in origin was not true.8 He no doubt felt that this rigorous critique of Christianity would, by contrast, only substantiate what he believed to be the superior religious claims of Judaism. He consciously used Christianity as a foil by which to make Judaism appear all the more reasonable and sensible. Then too, his strictures against Christianity were intended not only to silence Judaism's perceived foes, but also for internal Jewish consumption: to instill pride and self-respect among Jews as well as a renewed respect for their Judaism. But Wise upheld Judaism on its own merits and not merely by dint of a favorable contrast with a thoroughly disreputable religious alternative. He resolutely proclaimed his conception of Judaism (as opposed to an "Ortho- 5. Refer to Kraut, "Francis E. Abbot...," p. 111, n. 59, for references to Wise's attitudes on these issues. 6. See Isr., Sept. 2, 1870, p. 8, for an illuminating editorial self-analysis of why he felt it essential to attack Christianity rather than "write about Judaism and its merits and let Christi- anity alone." Much of the same reasoning reappears in Wise's later autobiographical rumina- tions in Die Deborah (1896-97) translated into English and collected in the "The World of My Books," pp. 136-37. 7. In essence, all his books on Christianity, explicitly or implicitly, argued that same point. Over the years, Wise's understanding of the dynamics of the development of Christianity changed, as did his attitude to the historicity of Jesus and the identity of Paul. But his central claim for Christianity's untenability remained constant. See the following books by Wise: The Origin of Christianity and a Commentary to the Acts of the Apostles (Cincinnati, 1868); The Martyrdom of Jesus of Nazareth (Cincinnati, 1874); Three Lectures on the Origin of Christianity (Cincinnati, 1883); Judaism and Christianity, Their Agreements and Disagreements (Cincinnati, 1883); A Defense ofJudaism versus Proselytizing Christianity (Cincinnati, 1889). 8.

Furthermore, this Judaism, whose essence, according to him, was characterized by the Decalogue, was destined to become, in a "pure and denationalized form," the universal "religion of humanity," toward which all mankind was moving.9 His unswerving faith in this ideal and in its real- ization, aptly deemed his "supreme passion,"'0 manifested itself in count- less sermons, speeches, newspaper editorials and in his many books." To be sure, his constant depiction of Judaism as the future religion also fulfilled pragmatic functions: it constituted a direct retort to Christianity's own eschatological expectations and, in addition, was aimed at fostering Jewish self-pride. By reminding Jews of the glorious religious future that was yet to come and their own role in bringing this about, Wise magnified Jewish reli- gious potential and the value of adhering to Judaism in the present. Indeed, many of his Israelite editorials and published sermons on the Judaism of the future read like "pep-talks" to the faithful to keep the faith now because the Jews possess a special mission with a unique spiritual destiny still to be real- ized.12 Wise's religious triumphalism was no doubt buttressed by his somewhat glorified self-image and his combative disposition. He was hot-tempered, energetic and vain. With his overblown-though not totally undeserved- sense of self, he was not averse to informing others of his numerous achieve- ments and to bask in the limelight of Jewish and, occasionally, Christian cir- cles. He regarded himself as the central religious leader of American Juda- ism and the prime mover behind its resurgence. He was the Jewish el Cid 9.

In his view, Judaism was destined to be as triumphant as he felt himself to be; its ultimate success would provide ample testimony to the victorious bat- tles of its most loyal adherent. Not surprisingly, just as he brooked no criti- cism of himself or his deeds, he did not countenance any criticism of Jews or Judaism, especially from the Christian world. Such criticism represented a personal attack, and he responded immediately, often recklessly; his outrage knew no bounds, as his many Christian antagonists were quick to discover. Wise and Unitarianism In comparison with his extensive writings on the history of Christianity generally and his critical evaluation of its doctrinaire offshoots, Wise wrote relatively little on liberal Christianity."3 From what he did write, however, and from his personal interaction with liberal Christian ministers, it appears that his initial attitude to liberal Christianity and its most national, institu- tional outgrowth, Unitarianism, was quite sympathetic. Indeed, from the 1850s through much of the 1870s, Wise noted the existence of a spiritual bond between Unitarianism and Liberal Judaism, and his relations with some Unitarians reflected it. Wise lived through the period of Unitarian expansion in the last half of the nineteenth century which saw the Unitarian movement spread to the Midwest and western United States from the confines of New England. During this time, Unitarians, like other religious liberals, including Reform Jews, attempted to reach a consensus on their own religious self-definition. The relationship of Unitarians to Christianity and to Christian religious beliefs-in fact, their problematic status as "Christians"--were major issues of debate, and resulted in substantive theological and regional cleavages within the movement. Disagreements were often based on highly subtle theological distinctions, and, at other times, on personality differences with- 13. Wise's attitude to liberal Christianity has been almost uniformly neglected in the sec- ondary literature. The only substantive treatment of this can be found in Knox, chap. 8, "Wise and Liberal Protestantism in Nineteenth Century America," pp. 147-58. Unfortunately, the chapter title is a bit of a misnomer, since Knox restricted his subject to a comparative analysis of Wise, Theodore Parker, Ralph W. Emerson, and William E. Channing and placed Wise in the Unitarian milieu of about 1850. Wise's relationship to Unitarianism during the rest of the century is not touched.</page><page sequence="8">186 BENNY KRAUT in the movement.14 While Wise was not really sensitive to the full range of theological nuances within Unitarianism, nor to the social groupings arising from them, he gradually evinced awareness of basic religious developments and allegiances within the Unitarian denomination which manifested itself in his own changing perceptions of Unitarianism over the years. He first encountered Unitarians early in his rabbinic career in Albany. In his Reminiscences, he recalled the aid which he received from Unitarian min- isters in silencing Christian missionaries.'" He also recorded a Washington meeting with Daniel Webster in 1852, in which the two men compared Uni- tarianism and Judaism, leading Wise to conclude "that there was no essen- tial difference in the matter of doctrine, but in historical development."'6 According to Wise, Webster retorted that "you are indeed my co-reli- gionist," repeating his earlier assertion in a morning meeting with Wise that "we are all Unitarians."" Whether these accounts are apocryphal or accu- rate is not of importance here.'" What is significant and of interest is that Wise's judgment of a close spiritual affinity between Judaism and Unitarian- ism corresponded to his views on Unitarianism in the 1850s, when the epi- sodes allegedly took place, and on through the mid-1870s when his Reminiscences was written.19 In August 1852, when Rev. Isaac Leeser declined Wise's invitation to help offset the expenses of putting out a weekly Anglo-Jewish newspaper, Wise wrote Leeser that, in his stead, he could expect Unitarian support for his venture. Wise informed Leeser that he would "make a contract with a Mr. Bendurzen, who is a known publisher and a Unitarian and therefore willing to assist my enterprise."20 Moreover, Wise suggested that he was 14.

See too Robert B. Tapp, Religion Among the Unitarian Universalists (New York, 1973), p. 39, which concludes that fifty-nine percent of Unitarian Universalist members today do not define their own local church as Chris- tian.

The very idea of a Jewish weekly supported by Unitarian readership was rather outlandish if for no other reason than, in 1852, most New England Unitarians were by no means so religiously liberal and open as to be interested in maintaining Jews and their religion. Furthermore, most New Englanders had no real acquaintance with Jews; there was only a very small Jewish community in the region, centered essentially in Boston. That they should be concerned with Judaism and Jewish affairs defies imagination. Still, however naive Wise's expectations were, they too reflected his early perception of a reli- gious bond connecting Unitarianism and Judaism and their respective adherents to each other. Wise acknowledged this bond in word and deed over the next two decades. During this time, his many contacts and friendships with Unitarian ministers resulted both in his praise for Unitarians, and, as well, concrete religious and sociopolitical interaction with them. Upon a visit to Keokuk, Iowa in 1869, for instance, he was delighted to discover the Unitarian church "gratuitously tendered" to a local group of about thirty Jews for their religious services. He took pains to note in his Israelite that Unitarians "pay everywhere a great deal of fraternal attention to our co-religionists, and their ministers ... are enlightened men of broad principles who on the great religious questions of the day fully coincide with us. We feel proud of our allies, and wish to see them prosper."22 On numerous occasions, Wise spoke to Unitarians (and other Chris- tians) who attended synagogue services, and he also lectured in Unitarian churches across the country.23 His ego undoubtedly fed, he seemed to revel 21. Ibid. 22. Isr., Aug. 13, 1869, p. 6. 23. For an example of the type of sermon Wise delivered at a church, see "The Humanitar- ian Standpoint," Isr., Oct. 7, 1870, p. 9, delivered at the Unitarian church of Rev. Thomas F. Vickers in Cincinnati. Basing himself on the prophets Isaiah 2:1-5 and Micah 4, Wise, in majestic language, limned the era of universal peace predicted by the prophets for which all humanity hoped and awaited. What is interesting is that he characterized his futuristic vision as "humanitarian" rather than "Jewish" which he so often did in polemics with conservative Christians.</page><page sequence="10">188 BENNY KRAUT in both these kinds of situations.24 He derived special pleasure from the acclaim he received in liberal Christian ranks as "the foremost advocate of Reform Judaism in America.""25 But ego aside, Wise's personal satisfaction was augmented by a feeling that, as a representative model of American Jews and Judaism, he was able to win for them much deserved recognition. Appalled by the negative stereotypes held by Christians-that Jews were ignorant and that Judaism was a religion of superstition-he continually sought to dispel these images, especially among liberal Christians.26 This was an integral part of his overarching concern to have Reform Judaism rec- ognized as a legitimate religious expression (in his mind, the only true and valid one) in contemporary America. Christian interest in his sermons and attendance at his services indicated to him that, to some extent, he was suc- ceeding. During his years in Cincinnati, Wise counted as friends such Unitarian ministers as Moncure D. Conway and Thomas F. Vickers of the First Con- gregational (Unitarian) Church. Conway, leader of the Church from 1856-1862, portrayed Wise in his autobiography as a valued friend possess- ing good sense and great energy. He attributed to Wise a clear-eyed percep- tion of the affinity between liberal Christianity and liberal Judaism. Wise "recognized even before I did myself," Conway remarked, "that my Christi- 24. His account of his trip to the Western United States records the churches in which he spoke and notes too the presence of Christians attending his guest lectures in synagogues. These accounts published in the AI, summer of 1877, were collected in a small book edited by William M. Kramer, The Western Journal of Isaac Mayer Wise, 1877 (Berkeley, 1974). See pp. 22, 40-42, 52, 56-57. Refer to Jewish Times, Jan. 7, 1870, p. 7 and Jan. 14, 1870, p. 5, in which Max Lilienthal expressed satisfaction that Wise's lectures attracted Christians. Wise was among the numerous Reform rabbis pleased that liberal Christians would come to hear them preach; it represented a mark of personal acceptance for them as well as being a source of social gratification. Thus Solomon Schindler of Boston's Temple Israel, for instance, established his reputation as a liberal religious preacher by regularly drawing large crowds of Christians in the 1870s and 1880s. 25. Isr., Oct. 5, 1866, pp. 4-5. Wise undoubtedly had this reputation. His Israelite was known to many Christians as were his indefatigable battles against Orthodox Christianity. Because of his reputation, Wise was solicited, along with Lilienthal, to join the Free Religious Association (see text below).

He recounted how "intimately acquainted" he had become with Wise and Lilienthal and that "long before any Union of American Hebrew Congregations existed or was publicly pro- jected, they discussed with me the general idea thereof, and many of the 27.

I hoped with them for great things from modern American Judaism."32 In previous years, Wise had paid glowing tribute to Vicker's First Congregational Church. Standing as it did on the corner of Eighth and Plum Streets, opposite both Wise's B'nai Yeshurun and Archbishop Purcell's Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Church was described by him in rather florid prose as the precursor of true religious awakening and humanity: "Liberty's mighty arm protects it. The conscious- ness of humanity salutes it as the sign of the morning, dawning upon the horizon of the human family."33 During the 1860s and 1870s, Wise considerably broadened his contacts with Unitarians, locally and nationally, over a wide range of issues relating in particular to the separation of church and state. Vickers and other reli- gious liberals, for example, joined with Wise in the nationally celebrated Cincinnati School Board controversy in 1869 over the inclusion of Bible readings in the public schools.34 In the 1870s, a national coalition of Protes- tant groups renewed its earlier effort to have the United States formally declared a Christian country by a constitutional amendment. Long devoted to full Jewish equality in a nonsectarian America, Wise had already denounced this proposal in the 1860s and had underscored the two religious groups who would be disenfranchised were the proposition adopted: Jews and Unitarians. Since no congressman or state legislator or lawyer could "practice in our court of justice" or "hold office at all unless he swears to 32. The speech in its entirety was published in the Jewish Tribune, May 6, 1881, p. 6. 33. Isr., Oct. 15, 1869, p. 8. Indicative of the attachment of some Jews to Vickers were their contributions to the building of his church. See AI, May 22, 1885, p. 4. One wonders what hap- pened to the friendship of Wise and Vickers from late 1881 on, as Vickers became embroiled in a major controversy with some University of Cincinnati students who had published a blister- ing nineteen point attack on him in the July issue of their literary society newspaper, The A cade- mia 2 (1881): 40-43, and who appealed to the Board of Directors to have him fired. Among those involved as editors of this journal during the life of this controversy were some of Wise's best Hebrew Union College students who took B.A. degrees at the University of Cincinnati: Joseph Krauskopf, Henry Berkowitz, and David Philipson. The controversy lasted over a year. See The Academia 2 (1881): 78; 2(1882): 88-89, 109; 3 (1882): 18.

Abbot, a former Uni- tarian and religious radical, to have the proposed "Christian Amendment" dropped.36 In 1876, Wise accepted Abbot's invitation to become a vice- president of his National Liberal League which united Jews, Unitarians, religious freethinkers and secularists in a pragmatic alliance dedicated to the cessation of all religious instruction and worship in public schools and to the repeal of all laws enforcing the Sunday Sabbath.37 Wise also came into close contact with the intellectual elite of Unitarian- ism, especially its left-wing branch. In 1867, he was invited to serve as a Director of the newly founded Free Religious Association (F.R.A.) in Boston, an organizational offshoot of radical Unitarians. A few years later, in 1872, Wise, in fact, became a vice-president of the F.R.A. and remained in that capacity until 1878-1879. Then too, Wise probably fostered some contacts between his Hebrew Union College and the American Unitarian Associa- tion. In 1879, no doubt due to his activities and reputation, the fledgling Hebrew Union College Library received thirty-nine "volumes of valuable books" as a gift from the A.U.A. headquarters in Boston. Jacob Ezekiel, secretary of the H.U.C. Board of Governors, thanked the A.U.A. for its "munificent donation" and expressed the Board's "esteem [for] this ... very liberal gift" on the part of the officers of the A.U.A. The Board hoped that one day "it may be in our power to reciprocate for this token of broth- erly-love."38 Apart from the kinship Wise felt for Unitarians based on personal friendships and a sense of commonality in fighting mutual foes, he attempt- ed on occasion during the 1860s and 1870s to define more specifically the theological bond between Jews and Unitarians. He pointedly excluded Uni- tarianism from those "erroneous doctrines" whose mission it was for Juda- ism to oppose: "Pure deism is one item of our programme of protest against 35.

Moreover, he called Unitar- ians "spiritual cousins" who differed from Jews not in the religious truths which they held but only in the sources from which they derived such truths. The rational and liberal Christian of today differs only in one main point from the Israelite. While the latter maintains Moses and the prophets teach us those very precepts which you and I revere as the most holy possession of man, the liberal Christian holds Jesus and the Apostles teach them, just as the modern philosophers view them as the products of developing humanity. The differ- ence lies in the sources, each looks to his own, not in the matter in which we must and do agree. All of us believe in a Supreme Being, Providence, universal goodness, justice, and wisdom; all of us believe in the immortality of the soul, the sanctity of virtue, the majesty of justice, the perfectibility of the human race, the fatherhood of God, and the brotherhood of man. We say Moses and the prophets teach and expound satisfactorily all this; they say Jesus and the Apostles do, and the philosopher maintains philosophy does.40 Wise repeated the same thought twelve years later. At that time, however, with his ardor for Unitarianism somewhat diminished, as we shall see, he emphasized the vital significance these different sources of religious truth had for distinguishing Judaism from Unitarianism.41 At times, especially during the decade following the American Civil War, Wise appeared genuinely ecstatic over the emergence of Unitarianism and various forms of liberal Christianity. He welcomed them as "signs of the times," reflecting a true religious awakening and the tremendous progress of rational religion, and foreshadowing the coming of the millennium. The emergence and flowering of Unitarianism and liberal Christianity seemed to vindicate for Wise his most cherished theological, historical and teleological affirmations. He had argued that Christianity, with its dogmas, supersti- tions, and authoritarianism was irreconcilable with the modern age and doomed to extinction. By stripping away Christology and other anti- rational doctrines from their religion, Unitarians were perceived by him as mighty contributors to that very process of Christian dissolution.42 39. Isr., Feb. 24, 1860, pp. 268-69. By "deism," Wise no doubt intended a rational theism with which he identified both Judaism and Unitarianism. 40. Isr., June 21, 1867, p. 4. 41. AI, May 16, 1879, p. 4. 42. The significance of Unitarianism for Wise's teleological expectations paralleled the sig- nificance of Reform Judaism for Unitarian Christians and other religious radicals who saw in Reform's evolution signs of the dissolution of all positive religions. See Kraut, "Francis E. Abbot .. ," passim.</page><page sequence="15">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 193 Further, the growth of Unitarianism confirmed for Wise his understand- ing of the essence of Christianity, his account of its origins and development, and his formulation of its necessary demise if religious progress was to be achieved. Wise worked for decades on the details describing the historical unfolding of Christianity, but one predominant motif in his writings persist- ed: Christianity consisted of nothing other than pure monotheistic Judaism to which were added, in the course of time, extraneous doctrines, symbols and superstitious rites.43 Religious progress, therefore, was measured and defined by the extent to which Christians peeled off all the dross and excres- cences which they had attached to Judaism over the years and returned to the pristine Judaism of the Decalogue. To Wise, Unitarians were doing pre- cisely that. They therefore functioned as a purifying agent within Christian- ity or, in other words, they served as the bridgehead among Christians for the judaization of Christianity.44 In the course of the 1870s and especially in the 1880s, when Wise's perspective gradually changed and he stressed the Christian character of Unitarianism, he nevertheless continued to portray Unitarians as useful agents for Judaism. They brought Christians closer to the only eternally valid religious truth, the Judaism of the Decalogue.45 The evolution of Unitarianism further confirmed for Wise his triumpha- list religious teleology. Fundamentally convinced, a priori, that Judaism- 43. In his Origins of Christianity (1868), Wise argued that Paul, whom he identified with the talmudic figure of Acher, was a "Unitarian Jew," and "Orthodox Pharisee" and a reformer who wanted to save the heathens. He found, however, that he could only get the heathens to the Father by a symbol of resurrection through the son and so introduced that idea. Paul himself did not believe it, but it was a ploy for the spiritual redemption of the pagan world. Only subse- quent to Paul's age did the ideas of trinity, universal depravity, and grace enter into Chris- tianity. See pp. 364-415. But Wise concluded that "Christianity's solid basis is an abstract from Moses and the prophets" (p. 533). In Judaism and Christianity (1883), Wise noted that the fun- damentals of all religion came from the only authentic revelation, the revelation at Sinai, which was intended for all nations. Whatever, therefore, was true in Christianity was taken from Judaism. See pp. 43, 46, 48. See too A Defense of Judaism (1889), p. 49. 44. See Judaism and Christianity, p. 48: "The world Judaizes and has Judaized for the last two thousand years." The notion of liberal Christians as agents of Judaizing was held by other Jewish Reformers as well. See Jewish Times, March 5, 1869, p. 10, for Rabbi Bernhard Fel- senthal's views on Unitarians and Freethinkers as missionaries of Judaism; see Jewish Times. Nov. 14, 1873, pp. 600-1, in which Ellinger, editor of the paper, called Unitarians, Universa- lists, and Free Religionists "Missionaries of the idea of Judaism"; see too the Jewish Times, Nov. 4, 1870, p. 569 and Jewish Times, April 9, 1869, p. 4. From a vertical perspective, and in a broad general sense, Wise's perception that Unitarianism was helping to judaize the world seems reminiscent of the theological approach to Christianity of Judah Halevi and Maimo- nides. Both men regarded Christianity as a whole as a means by which to spread the truth taught by Judaism to the world. 45.

Since Unitarians, as he understood them, were judaizing and were bringing Christians to the essential ideals and theology of Judaism, clearly then the only religion of the future had to be Judaism. And when Judaism did become universally accepted as the religion of humanity, the millennium would have arrived. In effect, for Wise, liberal Christianity played a significant role in ushering in the messianic age. On occasion, in fact, buoyed by his perceptions of the progress of religious liberalism in America, he prophesied that this age of religious unity wherein Judaism would be adopted-the messianic age-was imminent, as near as the end of the nineteenth century.46 Needless to say, these developments within liberal Christianity, as Wise interpreted them, added fuel to his many polemics with the more dogmatic denominations and churches within Christianity. Then too, these trends could only have helped him in his efforts to shore up Jewish allegiance to Judaism. It is no wonder that he embraced liberal Christians and Unitarians as "spiritual cousins." Wise and the Free Religious Association Wise's perception of liberal Christianity and its historical significance can best be seen in his early, almost heady, relationship with the Free Religious Association. Founded in 1867, the F.R.A. grew out of the intense intellectual ferment over the definition and appropriate characterization of the Unitarian religion.47 This theological soul-searching lasted a generation, 46. See Isaac M. Wise, The End of Popes, Nobles and Kings; or The Progress of Civilization (New York, 1852), p. 20; refer also to Dena Wilansky, Sinai to Cincinnati (New York, 1937), which cites an August, 1858 Israelite editorial in which Wise wrote that he "entertains not the least doubt that, before this century will close, the essence of Judaism will be THE religion of the great majority of all intelligent men in this country." See too AI, May 14, 1875, p. 4. Also, Kaufmann Kohler, in "The Mission of Israel and its Application to Modern Times," Yearbook of the Central Conference of American Rabbis 29 (1919): 280, noted that "Dr. Wise is reported to have said in his intimate circle ... that within fifty years Judaism's teachings will have become the common property of the American people." 47.

During this time, Unitarians groped for a formula which would make a normative statement of their religious orientation and express their predominantly Christian loyalties on the one hand, yet which also would not be taken as a creedal affirmation to exclude any liberal religionists on the other.48 But in the post-Civil War years, when European science and critical rational inquiry into religion were making inroads into American life, any mention of a "Christian" affiliation was anathema to some of the more radical within the denomination who interpreted Unitarianism in the most universal reli- gious terms. Hence, when the National Conference of Unitarian Churches adopted a preamble to a Unitarian Constitution which formally subscribed to the "Lordship of Jesus Christ" in April 1865, and when this preamble was reaffirmed after lenghty debate in a convention one year later, dissenting radicals such as Edward Towne, William T. Potter, and Francis E. Abbot founded the Free Religious Association. Together they prevailed on the prestigious Octavius Brooks Frothingham, minister of the Independent Liberal Church in New York, who was already disenchanted with the Uni- tarian religious direction, to serve as the first president of the F.R.A.49 Over the years, the F.R.A. devoted itself to the creation of a free and open platform for intellectual discourse on religion, to the promotion of religious liberty and the uprooting of religious authoritarianism, and to the scientific study of religion. It counted as officers, members, and lecturers in its numer- ous conventions some of the most prominent American religious liberals of the day, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas W. Higginson, Wendell Phillips, John Weiss, Ednah D. Cheney, Lucretia Mott, Lydia Maria Child, William C. Garrett, William L. Garrison, Gerrit Smith, Anna Garlin Spencer, Minot J. Savage, and John C. Haynes. While some of the main officers of the F.R.A. such as Frothingham, Potter, and Higginson considered themselves "non-Christians" and Abbot perceived himself to be "anti- Christian," the predominant majority of the F.R.A. was Unitarian.

Fur- ther, the question of whether the F.R.A. represented a religious ideology tran- scending all religions or was merely an organization with an open lecture platform plagued the Association to the end of the century.50 On one issue, however, the leadership of the F.R.A. was agreed: The Asso- ciation was open to individuals of all faiths and of no faiths; it was not a "Christian" group, but rather a nonexclusive, liberal religious organization interested in hearing all religious points of view.5' For this reason, Froth- ingham and Potter actively solicited the membership of Jews: Their presence testified both to the liberal character of the organizational as well as to its non-Christian nature.52 Consequently, both Wise and Lilienthal were invit- ed to speak to the first organizational meeting of the F.R.A. held on May 30, 1867. Neither could go, but Wise accepted with delight an invitation to serve as one of the six Directors of the F.R.A.53 The F.R.A. represented the first organized American association featuring Jews and Christians discussing religion and theology from the same lecture platform, and in a sense, ought therefore to be regarded as the first Jewish-Christian interfaith organization in America. The F.R.A. was both denounced and praised by Christians, depending on the part of the liberal-conservative religious spectrum in which they stood. Understandably, however, mainstream Unitarians equivocated. The F.R.A. 50. See, for instance, Octavius B.

Bellows, guiding force of the Uni- tarian denomination, and his followers, that the attempt to force a Unitar- ian consensus uniting all factions had failed.54 Jewish opinion on the F.R.A. tended to split along orthodox-liberal religious lines. Thus, the then tradi- tional Jewish Messenger saw it as a contemptible new religious sect consist- ing of "radicals of all complexions and sexes.""55 In contrast, Moritz Ellinger, radical reformer and editor of the Jewish Times lauded the organi- zation.56 Isaac M. Wise enthusiastically endorsed it. Wise must have been exceptionally gratified by his invitation to serve the F.R.A. and the recognition this entailed in the ranks of the aristocratic elite of America. But the F.R.A. held a far greater significance for him transcending the issue of personal prestige. The F.R.A. signified a clear sign of the progress in religion portending the end of fanaticism and superstition which he felt had caused so much human agony. He viewed the society as a welcome ally against the forces of Christian conservatism; it represented "an association of liberal men who intend to analyze the theological assumptions of the pop- ular creeds, and to do it in strict accordance with scientific principles." Since it was a foregone conclusion to Wise what the results of such an analysis would be-the acceptance of modern Judaism as the one rational religion reconcilable with modernity-he could not help but wish the F.R.A. "the best of success, and promise to do all in our power to aid the progress and final triumph of truth."57 Thus, repudiating a Jewish Messenger attack on the F.R.A. and on him for joining the organization, he accused the traditional paper and its editor, Samuel Myer Isaacs, of religious myopia, stupidity, and personal malevolence. Naturally, Christian conservatives who dread the "overflow of the traditions, dogmas, and usages of Christendom" would savagely attack the F.R.A. "But that a Jew should be stupid enough to raise the mad dog cry of infidelity at the heels of men who declare their intention to fight the battles of truth; that a Jewish leader should clamor along with those who see the divinity of Jesus and the veracity of the Gospel writers put in jeopardy, is so uncommonly absurd that it can only be accounted for by the malicious desire to throw suspicion on the Cincinnati co-religionists."58 54.

A few weeks after the founding organizational meeting of the F.R.A. in May 1867, he condemned Jewish and rabbinic reticence to speak publicly about the merits of Judaism. Pointing to the many Christian groups which met at conventions during the last week of May to articulate their religious ideol- ogy, Wise argued that Jewish silence on the beliefs of Judaism militated against a full appreciation and legitimization of Judaism in the Christian world. "If we could only get our co-religionists to speak publicly and under- standingly," he lamented, "we have no doubt that the masses of all liberal Christians would heartily and cheerfully welcome us as eminent co-laborers in the vineyard of the Lord." Jews and Judaism have so much to offer: "We do possess the great secrets of redemption which rational men begin to guess." While others may "observe a voluntary, though unpardonable silence," he, Wise, would not: "Whenever we shall be invited we will speak to the delight of all liberal Christians, all rational men, to the honor of God and the salvation of man.""59 With this statement, Wise may have also been justifying his association in a formal executive capacity with the F.R.A., which, from a Jewish perspec- tive, was generally regarded to be a Christian organization. One year later, he again reiterated his fervent belief that presenting Jewish opinion to the F.R.A. was most important because Jews have a special contribution to make. This time, however, he added a new justification for Jewish participa- tion in the F.R.A.: Jewish involvement would help fulfill the messianic mis- sion of Israel. It is of special importance that the Hebrew conception of religion, progress, humanity be represented there [at the F.R.A.] not merely for our sake, but chief- ly for the sake of the world and the Messianic duty of Israel. There is a certain train of thought, which only the Hebrew mind can originate and promulgate, the mind without the early impressions and prejudices of established and undisputed views. Only the Jew Baruch Spinoza could overthrow the very foundation of medieval scholasticism, as only the Jew Paul could conceive the scheme of primitive Christianity .... Therefore, whenever a free religious work is proposed, an honest desire after the acquired truth is manifested, the Jew should be present as a co-operative and efficient member.60 59.

Emphasis added.</page><page sequence="21">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 199 For Wise, the F.R.A. may well have assumed the guise of a society already judaizing in part and ripe for more, and he could not have been happier. He suggested that this organization served as a focal point to unite the various enlightened elements within Christianity, individuals who "have disposed of the teachings of the trinity and many Christian dogmas. More or less by so doing they come closer to the Judeo-theological point of view."61 In a letter to Adolph Huebsch one year previously, in November 1866, Wise expressed a similar sentiment about enlightened Christians: "The world of intelli- gence is so Judaized and they don't know it. Only real initiative is missing in order to win over hundreds of thousands to Judaism."62 He must have viewed the New England Brahmin aristocracy which constituted such a major part of the F.R.A. as among the Christian pillars of this "world of intel- ligence" and he sought "to win them over." Through the F.R.A.'s annual Boston conventions, its published proceedings, and its regional conventions, Wise gained a public forum through which he would not only introduce free religionists to the basic contours of a modern rational Judaism, but would also proclaim before this considerable "world of intelligence" that the rational free religion which they themselves espoused was actually nothing other than pure, denationalized Judaism. In short, Wise found a highly desirable public platform among the best educated and most liberal American religious elite to preach his own brand of Jewish religious triumphalism. And he did so without qualms or hesita- tion. In his two lectures at the annual Boston conventions of the F.R.A., he presented his basic vision of modern Judaism consistent with the views he had expressed in his many other writings. He did not alter his fundamental convictions because of his Christian audience. Indeed, he probably even felt or hoped that these liberal Christians would be most receptive to his ideas. Thus, "The Outlines of Judaism" developed some of his most standard notions: All religious truths are fully contained in the Decalogue; all Jewish laws are but concretizations of the spiritual principles of the Decalogue; the Decalogue contains a self-sufficient, complete system of ethics: "Neither Christianity, nor the Islam, nor Philosophy, has been able to add to the Decalogue one principle on which happiness depends, either here or hereaf- ter." Wise concluded with the assertion that "like the prophets of old, I am morally certain that this is the religion of coming generations."63 61. Die Deborah, Nov. 8, 1867, p. 70. 62. Letter of Isaac M.

Wise added that, as a Jew, he was "born into a free religious association which is as old as authentic history itself." Tongue in cheek, no doubt, he mused aloud that besides being a member of the F.R.A., perhaps he should be its president "for mine was the birthright." He resigned his claims because Frothingham was "as free a man as myself."64 The F.R.A. in its early years truly represented an organization of "spiri- tual cousins," and Wise devoted time and energy on its behalf. Besides his involvement in one form or another in its annual Boston conventions,65 he attended regional F.R.A. conventions, as was expected of board members, in Toledo, Detroit and New York.66 He offered his B'nai Yeshurun Temple for the Cincinnati F.R.A. convention in the fall of 1870, which he unfortunately missed because of his participation in the second meeting of Reform rabbis held simultaneously in New York.67 In June, 1871, in a lengthy editorial, Wise defended the entire F.R.A. and two of its more prominent members, 64. Proceedings 3 (1870): 83-89. Wise's claim is reminiscent of other instances in Jewish history in which Jews appropriated as theirs what they defined as the best and most valued ideals of society. Hellenistic literature, such as the Letter of Aristeas, comes to mind; so too does French Jewry's appropriation of the ideals of liberty, equality, fraternity which they found rooted in the prophets. With such claims, Jews sought to justify and solidify their position in society. 65. Wise's numerous activities prevented him from attending any national conventions save for the Third Annual Meeting in May 1870, at which time he delivered his "Permanent and Progressive Elements of Judaism." In 1869, he sent his paper "The Outlines of Judaism." He could not attend the First Annual Meeting in 1868, but sent a letter to explain his absence and confirmed that "I am with the free Religious Association." See Proceedings 1 (1868): 119-20. The dates of the Fourth Annual Meeting in 1871 conflicted with his Cincinnati Conference of American Rabbis, so O.B. Frothingham gave a synopsis of the lecture Wise would have pre- sented.

Bartol, whose speeches at the May, 1871 Boston convention had been criticized by the New York Herald.68 In 1868, Wise "respectfully dedicated" his The Origin of Christianity to the Free Religious Association, noting that regardless of the harsh criticism and scorn the book would receive from some, he could not "think or write otherwise than free," and he therefore placed the book "under the protec- tion of the enlightened and thinking men of the age, whom I believe to have discovered among the Free Religious Association."69 There "is but one common centre for the human family in all these tumultous upheavings of diverging opinions and views," Wise observed, "and this common centre is truth. It is every good man's first duty to approach this centre as rapidly as he can. Therefore I wrote this volume, and therefore I am with the Free Religious Association."70 On the same dedication page, in deliberate allu- sion to himself, the F.R.A., and religious liberals generally, he added: "Truth is the Redeemer of Mankind. The Apostles of Truth and Charity are the Angels of the Most High, and the Priests of Humanity." The dedication of this book to the F.R.A. was rather appropriate, for many of the Association's members were leading scholars of religion who explored the roots of Christianity with modern critical methods. Wise there- fore gained an intelligent audience before whom he could demonstrate his debunking of Christianity. Contending that Christianity consisted merely of pure Judaism supplemented with layers of symbols, dogmas, and supersti- tions, he suggested that he was opening a "new channel of research to histor- iographers, no less than to theological students," by focusing on a compari- son of the New Testament with the Talmud with respect to passages from the time of Jesus and the Gospels.7' In reality, the F.R.A. leadership must have been rather surprised, if not truly astonished, at the labors of a Jew in this domain. There are no indications that they were receptive to his work or took his scholarship very seriously. At any rate, Wise pledged his full support to the F.R.A.: "As long as the Association supports freedom, truth, progress, humanity, and the elevation of human nature; as long as reason is its supreme authority, philosophy the mother of its banner, truth its acknowledged redeemer, and the fellowship 68.

In the free further development of the religious ideal to realize the messianic hopes, this movement [the F.R.A.] is especially important."73 Spiritual Distance Gradually during the 1870s and 1880s, Wise came to realize the limits of "spiritual cousinship" between Jews and liberal Christians generally and Unitarians and the F.R.A. in particular. One can discern the tell-tale signs of the unfolding process of his realization from his reactions to various reli- gious attitudes of his liberal Christian counterparts. Indeed, his emerging perceptions of liberal Christianity coincided with his awareness, periodically expresed in the 1870s, that the millennium was not imminent, that it could not be expected by the beginning of the twentieth century, and that its time still lay in the far distant future.74 By the 1880s, quite cognizant of continued American Christian anti-Jewish expressions (such as the Seligman-Hilton affair), of the erupting European nationalist and racist antisemitism, and of the limited attraction of rational religion to the overwhelming majority of Americans, Wise repeatedly averred that the Jewish mission was not yet ful- filled and that the world "approaches Israel only very slowly." Jewish forms and rituals had to be observed, for the "preservation of Jews through and in Judaism."75 No doubt his commitment to Jewish national institutions such as the Hebrew Union College and the Union of American Hebrew Congre- gations also helped deepen his practical allegiance to Jewish particularism and rendered the fulfillment of his universalist millennial hopes less urgent and compelling. With all these factors to consider, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the precise extent to which Wise's disenchantment with liberal Christianity caused his being resigned to a distant millennium. Assuredly, however, it must have been a significant contributory factor. 72. Proceedings 3 (1870): 83-89. 73. Die Deborah, Nov. 8, 1867, p. 70. 74.

Liberal Christians, including some of the more religiously radical in the F.R.A., still harbored the tradi- tional picture of Judaism's having been superseded by Christianity. Thus, whether they were self-avowed anti-Christians like Francis Abbot or more moderate theistic non-Christians like Frothingham and Potter, the free reli- gionists agreed that, with Jesus and the emergence of Christianity, Judaism was supplanted by a far more advanced religion. "Christianity is the crown- ing glory of religion thus far," Frothingham remarked.76 It "emancipated human nature from terrible Jewish thraldom."77 In this regard the religious left of Unitarianilsm did not differ at all from its more conservative Uni- tarian associates within the F.R.A. like C. D. B. Mills7' and S. R. Calthrop,79 nor from mainstream Unitarians unaffiliated with the F.R.A. such as Henry W. Bellowsso and James Freeman Clarke,8' nor, for that matter, from the Christian right wing of evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics. Bib- lical and postbiblical Judaism was still seen upon retrospective reflection as narrow, tribal, and rigid in contradistinction to early Christianity. Moreover, as an outgrowth of "old" Judaism, modern Judaism at best could be enthusiastically welcomed as an example of rational progress in religion and as a harbinger of Judaism's anticipated dissolution. No liberal Christian, however radical, could grant it the significance which it had for Wise. Ultimately, Frothingham, although President of the F.R.A., perhaps best captured the essential liberal Christian feeling about modern Judaism: It is "a grand anomaly in a generation looking for newer things."82 In keep- 76.

The basic thrust of his theology sought to demonstrate that biblical Judaism, far from being superseded, was in fact the only authentic source of religious truth and divine revelation. The revelation at Sinai, witnessed by six hundred thou- sand adult male Jews, was the core of all religious and moral knowledge, not a transient historical event. Wise, moreover, was understandably quite piqued by this almost axiomatic dismissal of the tenability of modern Juda- ism. Thus, he sharply criticized a speech by Frothingham on "The Religious Outlook of America" delivered at the New York F.R.A. convention in Octo- ber, 1873. He contended that Frothingham had only indicated the negative, that is, what this future religion would not be-it would not be Christi- anity-but he did not describe in positive terms what it would be. Wise, of course, readily supplied the answer-it would be "rational Judaism." What is interesting here, however, is not so much his expected answer, but his analysis as to why Christians refuse to acknowledge this truth and continue to ignore Judaism: prejudice against Jews and Judaism. He suggested that down through the centuries Christians did everything in their power to dis- sociate their religion from Judaism-to "unjudaize" it. They changed their Sabbath to Sunday, for instance, and instituted holidays such as Easter and Pentecost to remove any vestigial Jewish influence. Then, following this dejudaization process, a centuries old hatred for Jews and Judaism was born. "No wonder, then, that the born Christian does not like the idea that he, though not himself a Jew, should believe like a Jew. If this were not the case, it was an easy task to predict what religion in America will be. It will be rational Judaism." In almost petulant tones, no doubt reflecting his irri- tation, he took the opportunity again to characterize the rational core of Christianity as Jewish and predict the universalization of Judaism. But the world has not outgrown its prejudices against the Jew and Judaism; therefore not even Mr. Frothingham, as liberal a gentleman as there is one in this country or elsewhere, can tell us what the religion of America will be, and must stop short in telling us what it will not be. Every thinker in this country knows that the belief in the Christian story, miracles and dogmas, evaporates 83. The Index, April 5, 1873. See Rabbi M. Schlesinger's reply that Judaism is pure theism and that it really is a free religious association.

The unsophisticated and unprejudiced can see no less clear that the rational and humane elements of Christianity will survive the revolution: but these elements are part and parcel of Judaism. Therefore we know what the religion of America will be.84 Besides coming to understand that liberal Christians took the obso- lescence of Judaism for granted, Wise also discerned that they held an intensely emotional attachment to their own historical, religious roots, to their "cherished historical continuity.""8 As Charles W. Wendte, a Cincin- nati Unitarian and later president of the F.R.A., asserted in a public polemic with Wise, "why should I not claim to be a Christian? I was born one.. ."86 Despite having discarded all notions of Christian supernatural origins, lib- eral Christians of varying shades of religious liberalism ultimately sought to preserve in some way their relationship to the historic phenomenon of Christianity, or at least, to the Christian name."87 Hence, even Frothingham, who throughout his active presidency of the F.R.A. (1867-1878) insisted that the future religion would transcend Chris- tianity, could nonetheless not divest himself of latent emotional ties to Christianity which openly surfaced over the last decades of his life. As early as 1870, Wise had correctly portrayed Frothingham as "not entirely free from Christological tincture,""8 and, indeed, the latter seemed to recant from his free religious position in 1881.89 Frothingham's feelings for Chris- tianity best exemplify the socially and culturally rooted attachment to Chris- 84.

See too, Wright, p. 74, who cites Joseph Henry Allen, in 1882: "The name Christian does not rest on any theory whatever about the nature or office or person or doctrine of Christ. It rests simply on the fact that we are Christian by habit or inheritance, unless we deliberately choose to renounce that name in favor of some other." 87. One need but read The Index edited by Francis E. Abbot (1870-1880) and later by Wil- liam Potter to get a sampling of the debate over who was a Christian and how Christianity was to be defined. Cf. May 4, 1872 for an article by William Spencer, "What's in a Name?"; March 17, 1881-John Chadwick, "Are We Still Christians?" These kinds of articles number in the dozens. 88. Isr., Nov. 18, 1870, p. 8. In February of 1871, Frothingham introduced Wise to a New York F.R.A. audience and referred to New York as this "Christian city," for which he was criti- cized by the press. See Jewish Messenger, Feb. 24, 1871. 89. This "christological tincture" may have been with Frothingham all his life. It certainly was the subject of a great dispute among his Unitarian friends and the press in 1881 as to whether or not he recanted of free-religion. See Carruthers, p. 190-207.</page><page sequence="28">206 BENNY KRAUT tianity of some of the more radical religious liberals. For him, as for others, Christianity was identified with a more culturally defined Western Civiliza- tion which it helped propagate and which appealed to their sensibilities and taste; it formed the matrix of all the values, manners, and institutions worth keeping. In his Recollections of 1890, Frothingham observed: "The coming religion must be Christian in name, because Christianity as an ideal faith, has worked itself into our common life. It is the soul of our laws, of our cus- toms, of our institutions. All assume its authority; all respect its sanc- tions."90 These historical-emotional ties to Christianity were not unique to Frothingham; save for a very few religious radicals who transcended their Christianity like Francis E. Abbot, the chief proponents of religious liberal- ism and universalism held wide ecumenical sympathies, but few cut loose from their denominational loyalties.91 Very few truly slipped "all Christian moorings and radically declared for a religion of humanity."92 In previous decades, when Wise had observed that the distinction between Judaism and Unitarianism lay not in doctrine but only in their dis- crete historical lines of development and sources of religious truth, he had minimized the significance of these distinctions. During the 1870s and 1880s, however, he began to acknowledge that the ties liberal Christians had to their Christian past were no less deep than his own to Judaism, and, of necessity, would separate liberal Christians from Jews and Judaism for the immediate and foreseeable future. These impressions deepened as Wise encountered other forms of liberal Christian self-definition which he deemed intellectually indefensible or which he perceived to derogate the value and contributions of Judaism either explicitly or implicitly. Thus, he challenged those Christians who stressed the need to emulate the life's pattern and follow the teachings of a human, but perfect, Jesus, and he denounced others who, by extension, sim- ply equated Christianity with absolute morality. Those religious liberals who found their paradigm of pristine religiosity to rest in the virtuous life and moral lessons of a humanized Jesus rejected the accumulated church doctrines over the centuries. For them, the personal model of Jesus-his moral power and thought-stood as the bedrock of 90. Octavius B. Frothingham, Recollections and Impressions 1822-1890 (New York, 1891), p. 280. 91. Sidney E.

In effect, the centrality of Jesus for these liberal Christians paralleled the central role of the Decalogue for Wise; each represented final and complete religious truth toward which all religious progress pointed. For Wise, however, Jesus was merely a Jew whose life and teaching con- tributed nothing novel to true religion. And, on occasion, besides his books on the subject,93 he disputed specific attempts by Unitarians to use Jesus as a religious model. Thus, when Rev. Henry Bellows wrote that the Church "must come back to reason and religion, must bury its old time dogmas and forms, must seize what is vital and eternally significant in Christianity, must return to the simplicity of Christ. ...," Wise retorted that Bellows was not going far enough. "Christology, the whole dogmatic structure, has to go," he claimed, clearly linking the call for a "return to the simplicity of Christ" with Christology.94 The use of a humanized Jesus as the locus of Christian faith by a Unitar- ian involved Wise in a major public controversy. In the fall of 1877, Charles Wendte published a pamphlet What Do Unitarians Believe? Professing to be a rationalist and religious radical, Wendte nonetheless affirmed that "Uni- tarians believe in Jesus Christ" and that he personally was a Christian because of his belief in Jesus-not in the Christ of dogma but in the "actual- ity and nobility of Christ's life and character" and in his "perfect humanity." Wise delivered a scathing and often sarcastic rebuke of Wendte in a dis- course at his temple which he subsequently published in the American Israel- ite. He called Wendte a "pious fraud," arguing that one could not simulta- neously be a rationalist biblical critic as Wendte was and yet a believer in such a "self-fabricated idol" as a human model of perfection. After David F. Strauss's repudiation of the Gospel's legitimacy, Wise averred, one could not revert back to Schleiermacher's "new idol of perfection" as Wendte had attempted. Moreover, on pragmatic grounds Jesus could never serve as such a model: "The man who lived but half the years commonly allotted to man, was neither parent nor public officer, lived in a narrow circle of enthusiasts, without knowledge of foreign countries or languages, whose mind had a 93. See especially Wise, The Martyrdom of Jesus of Nazareth, which argued that Jesus died not for any idea but to save the lives of his fellow Jewish nationalists fighting against the Romans.

This was not Unitarianism, Wise maintained, because Unitarians have no creed; rather, this was the Unitarianism of Charles Wendte.95 But, in reality, Wendte's attitude did reflect Unitarianism, and repeated- ly Wise found himself at odds with Unitarians over the figure of Jesus. Thus, he criticized an article by Rev. William L. Chaffin in The Unitarian Review on "The Intellectual Greatness of Jesus" and reiterated his opposition to the use of Jesus' life as a pattern of human perfection.96 Similarly, he reviewed critically the book, Institute Essays, by the Unitarians' Ministers' Institute, which, for him, with the exception of two essays by Rabbi Gustav Gottheil and Francis E. Abbot, concentrated all too much on the personality and character of Jesus. "The volume offers excellent reading for Unitarian church-members. For the ordinary reader there is in it too much Jesus, gospel, religion of feelings and emotional philosophy to be assimilated. .. ." Not Theodore Parker is found in the book, Wise declared, but "Plato, Philo, Plotin, the Kabbala, Schleiermacher, and Symbolism.""97 In 1878, Wise published a letter by Moncure Conway reporting the findings of Ernest von Bunsen that Jesus was not of Jewish birth. To this he remarked: "It would not hurt our feelings.... We never thought that Jesus was so very great a man that we ought to be proud of his Jewish origin. ... Jesus of Nazareth and Benjamin D'Israeli should glorify themselves with the fact that they descend from a nation of prophets, priests, and princes."98 By ennobling Jesus as "perfect humanity" embodying absolute morality, by asserting that "his theory of human life is the outline of the best we can hope for,""99 liberal Christians, consciously or not, drew the implicit logical consequence: Any act of goodness, love, or charity was by its very nature and definition a "Christian" act. Morality and Christianity were synony- 95. AI, Dec. 21, 1877, p. 4. Wendte replied to the published attack in the Cincinnati Com- mercial, Dec. 22, 1877, p. 11. 96. AI, March 26, 1880, p. 4. 97.

For many, this sentiment expressed their basic Christian affirmation and identity. Thus, for instance, a man like Andrew White, president of Cornell University, professed belief in Matthew Arnold's "power in the universe, not ourselves which makes for righteousness," and espoused a "pure religion," yet still found this religion in "the precepts and ideals of the blessed Founder of Christianity, Jesus";100 for him, a "Christian" was one who was "moral in the best sense."'0' In this attitude liberal Christians were indistinguishable from their conservative colleagues.'02 Wise took great exception to this type of equation, and on this he was not alone; from time to time other prominent Jews expressed indignation with this phenomenon.'03 When the Unitarian Rev. Charles A. Allen of New Orleans announced that Jews "have accepted Christ and are now good Christians," he resorted to some theological gymnastics which prompted Wise to reply immediately. Allen first identified the "acceptance of Christ" with the "reality of character" and with fulfillment of Jesus' central com- mand, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," and then, noting that Jews were becoming morally upstanding individuals, concluded that they in fact were becoming "Christians." Wise would have none of this spurious logic. It was Moses who first taught Jews to be holy because the Lord God is holy (Levi- ticus 19:2), and while this teaching "may be new to Christians," it was "very old to the Jews." Second, he reminded Allen that the precept of "love thy neighbor" was Jewish, and that "for some years some Christians have begun to believe the old Jewish doctrine of Moses." Therefore, Wise declared, "it is 100. Andrew White, A History of the Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom (New York, 1896), p. xii. 101. Letter of Felix Adler to William C.

This attitude underlay the great movement of the Protestant Social Gospel which attempted to apply Jesus' moral teachings to contemporary society. See Charles H. Hopkins, The Rise of the Social Gospel in American Protestantism, 1865-1915 (New Haven, 1940). 103.

Clearly, not all Jews were pleased to be called "good Christians" or to have their moral behavior labeled "Christian." Contrast this observation with Jonathan D. Sarna, "The Freethinker, The Jews, and the Missionaries: George Houston and the Mystery of Israel Vindicated," AJSreview 5 (1980): 107 and n. 16.</page><page sequence="32">210 BENNY KRAUT evident that some Christians 'accept Moses,' and try to satisfy themselves that Jesus, after all, may have taught the same lessons as Moses did fifteen centuries before him."'04 Wise's reply was not simply facetious and mocking satire; he really believed in the logic of his position. According to him, Christians were accepting "Jewish" truths and therefore were approaching Judaism! But the logical underpinning for this position was identical to that of Allen: Abso- lute morality was defined to inhere in his religious system, and therefore any practitioners of such principles of morality could be identified as adherents of his religion. Because Judaism preceded Christianity chronologically, in this instance where similar moral precepts were at issue, Wise understandably contended that "we had it first." In the general debate over which religion was truly the best, however, Christians like Allen, more often than not, pointed to Christian departures from Judaism, that is, to some moral excel- lences or new religious motifs which Judaism did not have. Three years later, for example, this same Allen proclaimed a "higher inspiration" for Christianity over Judaism based on its supposedly more humanitarian spirit, hope for immortality, and nonracially exclusive character. Wise did not lack for answers.105 In formulating their own definitions of Christianity, understandably, some liberal Christians prophesied the universality of their religion as the religion of the future. This claim, however, clearly challenged Wise's own prediction of ultimate Jewish religious supremacy, and he brooked no com- petition. After all, he had consistently argued that liberal Christianity con- tained nothing of value that was not Jewish in origin, so that the religion of the future ought to be called by its rightful name-Judaism.l06 In 1879, the prominent Unitarian minister and F.R.A. member, Minot Savage, visited Cincinnati and preached in Wendte's Unitarian Church. After having proclaimed that "above and beyond all else, Unitarian stands for morality," he then prophesied on the future of religion: On the supposition that the world advances, that civilization progresses, we are the only faith [Unitarian] that does have a future. We have an opportunity to reconcile between the thought and science of the age and the religious life. Not trying to organize on the basis of a creed, which in a growing universe can 104.

Thus organized, we shall occupy a position absolutely impregnable; one that will ultimately bring the whole intelligent world to our side. Then every step the world takes ahead will be a step toward us. Our confidence, then, is in the belief that God rules, and that intelligence in the long run will govern the world.... Eternity is long; God is not in haste, and we can afford to stand by His eternal principles of reason and righteous- ness and wait.'07 Wise lauded Savage's accent on morality in Unitarianism, but then went on the attack. Unitarianism could not become the universal religion of the millennium because it still smacked of Christianity. As long as Unitarians related to the Christ story, as long as they were obligated "like Hegel, Schleiermacher and their followers, to make something reasonable of that Christ story with its exorcism and necromancy, in order to be called Chris- tian," they stand outside the principle of reason, and can not therefore bear the universal religion. The only true religion of reason and righteousness is Judaism, and the Unitarians have not yet arrived at it. It appears that Mr. Savage forgot in his own zeal that there are several hun- dred thousand Jews in the country, and several millions of them in this little world. He wanted to say, and he did not, that the Unitarian is the only semi- Christian faith which has embraced most of the Jewish principle of reason and righteousness, and therefore has a future of purging itself of the purely Chris- tian element. That is all there is about it.108 This dispute furnishes an excellent example of two liberal theists so close on religious fundamentals such as the role of reason and morality in reli- gion, who were yet separated by their profound loyalty to their respective historical religions and historical lines of religious development. In reality, Wise could have comfortably delivered Savage's speech, and issued the same proclamations about progress, the reconciliation of religion with life and science, and the bringing of the intelligent world to "our side." Indeed, he did so on innumerable occasions, but, for him, "our side" was Judaism. 107. Cited by Wise in AI, May 16, 1879, p. 4. 108. Ibid. Abbot, militant anti-Christian, heartily concurred with Wise that Savage had too much Jesus in his system.

Needless to say, his views were heard and perhaps digested, but few, if any, liberal Christians were convinced. That the "Christian" world, the vast social majority, the locus of Western civilization in which Jews were seen as but marginal, would suddenly define its fundamental beliefs as Jewish could not have been considered anything but ludicrous. What is more, the contemporary American Jewish scene, with its small numbers of mostly business oriented Jews not part of genteel soci- ety, its dearth of outstanding English speaking rabbis, its lack of Jewish lit- erature in English, and its general intellectual poverty, did nothing to grant Wise's call any conceivable semblance of reality. In moments of clear- sightedness, Wise himself acknowledged these Jewish shortcomings and their negative impact on non-Jewish society.109 Wise's perception of the spiritual distance between Jews and their liberal Christian counterparts emerged during the 1870s-1880s as he witnessed the latter's allegiance to the "Christian" name. His relationship to the F.R.A., however, floundered because of other developments, specifically, Felix Adler's accession to the presidency of the F.R.A. in 1878 succeeding Froth- ingham."0 Neither geographic nor theological distance from the Boston- oriented F.R.A. had diminished Wise's support or respect for the organiza- tion in his first decade of membership. But in the wake of Adler's enthusias- tic reception by the F.R.A., which Wise neither understood nor condoned, he broke irrevocably with the group. To Frothingham, Potter, Abbot and others in the F.R.A., Adler was the new sensation of the free thought movement in the late 1870s."'l His cre- ation of the New York Society for Ethical Culture was noticed and applauded, and Frothingham, for one, hoped that the dynamic Adler would invigorate the F.R.A. and instill a new social direction to the organization. "I am the final attenuation of the old school," Frothingham told his friend Jus- tice George C. Barret.

Adler and his Society's perceived transcendence of Judaism seemed to have fulfilled that call from within Jewish circles. The radical Abbot was particularly overjoyed, sensing a religious soul mate whose spiri- tual inclinations seemed to match his own. Wise, on the other hand, deplored Adler and held him in contempt as a vile apostate from Judaism worthy only of denunciation. His loathing of Adler stemmed from a variety of factors. Adler's lectures, publications, and institutional work repudiated all of his cherished ideals. Adler had rejected theism, adopted biblical criticism and applied it to the Hebrew Bible, dis- missed Jewish ritual practices, repudiated the religious centrality and final- ity of the Decalogue, and denied the possible universalization of Judaism. Moreover, Adler had contended that prophetic ethics were reflective of their historical age and therefore dated, while Jesus' ethics, although also inade- quate for modern times, represented an advance over Judaism: "Jesus was one of the noblest and purest characters that ever lived." Wise was further agitated by the extensive publicity Adler received by the "hostile," "anti-Jewish" New York press which was picked up by the national press."13 Thus, not only did Adler, son of Temple Emanu-El's Rabbi Samuel Adler, gain Jewish followers in New York, but he also received national exposure in which he disgraced Jews and Judaism in front of the Christian world with assertions such as "Judaism is dying!""14 Wise saw this as a mockery of Jews and Judaism, and he feared that the positive impressions of Judaism which he had relentlessly cultivated among Chris- tians were being undermined. From his initial tentative evaluation of Adler in 1876 and through the 1880s, Wise vented his spleen against the founder of Ethical Culture in both intellectual disputation and ad hominem invective.'"I In public polemics, he 112.

Wise even compared Adler unfavorably to Frothingham, remarking that he could not match the scholarship and oratorical eloquence of the first F.R.A. president."16 When, therefore, the free-religionists so warmly embraced Adler, Wise knew he was in the wrong company. He bitterly resented the honor this "atheist" received at the hands of one of the foremost liberal Christian groups in the country. This resentment may well have been heightened by personal jealousy. In the course of 1879, Wise withdrew as a vice-president of the F.R.A., probably influenced by a heated interchange with Francis E. Abbot over Felix Adler. Wise had urged that all Jews affiliating with Ethical Culture should be expelled from their synagogues: "No man can serve two masters," he exclaimed."' In his defense of Adler, Abbot pointed out that it was Wise who was serving two masters, by serving as rabbi of his synagogue and as vice-president of the free-thinking F.R.A.'18 In June of 1879, Wise was no longer listed as a vice-president of the F.R.A, and his position on the board was taken over by Rabbi Bernhard Felsenthal, a close friend of Adler's.119 Wise's rancor at the F.R.A., and free religion generally, lingered on. In the spring of 1879, he looked back at twenty-five years of progress for American Judaism and observed: "We are no longer pitied, hunted, or con- verted by bigoted sectarians; all the new-fangled creeds pass by us unno- ticed; atheism, nihilism, and the so-called free religionism make no impres- sion in our ranks."120 No longer did he wish to associate either himself or Judaism with free religion. His previous identification of Judaism as a pure free religious association went by the wayside. In an obvious reference to Adler and the F.R.A., Wise suggested in 1886 that the F.R.A. had been "debased by . . . various social, political, and atheistical schisms" following 116. AI, Nov. 3, 1876, p. 5; AI, Jan. 10, 1869, p. 41. Interestingly, the Christian Register made the same identification of Ethical Culture with Unitarianism. See The Index, April 1, 1886. 117. AI, Jan. 10, 1879, p. 4. 118. The Index, Feb. 20, 1879. Wise had not yet formally requested that his name be deleted when Adler became President. Without a formal request, the F.R.A. tended to carry over its Board members. 119. On this friendship, see Kraut, From Reform Judaism to Ethical Culture, pp. 161-65. 120.

Frothingham from the Presidency of the Free Religious Association, it has changed its character into a non-free, irreli- gious society of a semi-political character, with which we could have no fur- ther connection. It does no longer want us. It seeks atheists, materialists, com- munists and such other extremists, among whom we do not want to be count- ed. We never "went back on them," ... but we cannot be one of them. We did not go back at all, as the proceedings of the society amply show, but the soci- ety left us to fish in the air, and we could stand on positive grounds only.122 Apparently, Wise had been asked frequently to comment on the F.R.A. on which he had lavished such praise in former days, because he concluded his observations on the F.R.A. with the hope that his statement would "satisfy the friends who again and again call our attention to this society." The election of Adler as President of the F.R.A. in 1878 represented a decisive defeat for Wise's anticipation that the most liberal Christians would recognize their purely rational religion as Judaism and openly avow it. One week following the 1878 F.R.A. annual national convention, Wise wrote one of his most pessimistic yet highly penetrating essays explaining why Judaism would not make great headway in America in the next twenty-five years. Affirming that many gentiles simply will not affiliate themselves with Hebrew congregations, he had particularly harsh words for liberal Chris- tians. 23 Other factors may also have contributed to his somewhat defeatist mood, but the Adler situation seems to have been uppermost in his mind. Wise listed a number of reasons why the prospect of progress for Juda- ism among the gentiles was bleak. It was more socially desirable to be a Christian; it was also more economically advantageous. Then, too, four- fifths of all men have neither the capacity nor time to think, so they pay their priests, ministers and missionaries to think. Under these circumstances, "truth that would upset their situation is banished." The other fifth does reason, and on utilitarian grounds, declares that the moral state of society needs religion lest it would fall prey to communism, socialism, free love, spiritualism, materialism and atheism. Religion is defined as Christianity, 121. AI, July 16, 1886, p. 4. 122. Al, March 24, 1882, p. 308. 123.

Wise also pointed to Jewish shortcomings to help explain the lack of attraction of Judaism to Christians. Jews were relatively recent arrivals in America, so they could not yet hope to have impressed their principles on the American community. More significantly, American Judaism had no able exponents, no intelligentsia, who could write and speak in "classical English." Most Jewish preachers were Germans with limited appeal. Conse- quently, Judaism had no English Jewish literature expounding the religion in rational, attractive language, and as long as this prevailed, Judaism would make no positive impression on the community nor prove its religious supe- riority over Christianity. But what of liberal Christians like Unitarians and members of the F.R.A.-why did they not acknowledge and accept Judaism? An apparently despondent and bitter Wise answered: anti-Jewish prejudice. He had briefly suggested this before in reference to Frothingham,124 but here his sense of frustration and anger, and his alienation from liberal Christians reached its highest expression. Old prejudices will not wear out so fast. Christian prejudices are averse to the idea of being a Jew or Jewish, or anything like it. Thousands, tens of thou- sands, are rooted with their convictions deeply in Judaism, think, believe, and feel exactly like the religious Jews, believe in God, immortality, and revelation plain and simply as reconcilable with reason and science; yet their inveterate prejudices would not let them confess that they actually are Jews. They must be in their own opinion something better than, or at least something different from, the Jews. Any of your enlightened neighbors, if he is candid enough, will testify to this fact. Why do your freethinkers or so-called liberal Christians not at once say we are denationalized Jews? They do not believe the Gospel story, they do not believe the dogmas of the church, they protest against every point in Christology; they profess to believe in God, immortality and revelation; why do they not make common cause with the Jews whose belief is exactly like theirs? On account of the inborn prejudice against the Jew and the Jewish name is the only reply we can give.'25 Wise further asserted that, in discussion, any "advanced" Christian, cleric 124. Isr., Nov. 14, 1873, p. 4. 125. AI, June 7, 1878, p. 4. Emphasis added.</page><page sequence="39">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 217 or layman, would agree with Jews on all religious principles, yet at the very end, would insist that his belief is "just a little better than yours, although to save his soul he could not tell you that particular point." It is in consequence of that inveterate prejudice that so-called liberal Chris- tians rather sail under the false colors of Jesus and Christianity than stand by the old flag of denationalized Judaism, the old covenant under the new era of freedom. One of the most advanced champions of enlightened religion once told us after we had concluded a lecture: "Your doctrines are mine exactly. You are all right, but had better change your firm."126 The mercurial Wise often resorted to hyperbole to make his point. His blanket indictment of liberal Christians' prejudice against Jews as the sole factor militating against their acceptance of Judaism must therefore be taken with a considerable grain of salt.127 His religious triumphalism some- times refused to accept the reality that liberal Christians were unwilling to give up their own religious heritage, and that they preferred to resolve intel- lectually their problematic identity as "rational," "liberal," "Christians" within their own sociocultural and religious context. Whatever merits Wise exhibited as theologian, rabbi, and thinker, his insights into the anthropol- ogy and sociology of religion left something to be desired. Indeed, in that very essay, he furnished other socioeconomic and historical reasons why Christians would not accept Judaism; only the similar disinclination of lib- eral Christians and free thinkers was interpreted in terms of prejudice. However well reasoned and perceptive the rest of his essay may have been, the section on liberal Christianity is valuable more as a gauge of Wise's mood than as an accurate historical explanation. It was written not in a cool, dispassionate voice but in heat. It reflects his deep-seated fury and frustration with a liberal Christian organization which had chosen a defec- tor from Judaism and the Jewish community as its head. This represented the ultimate insult to Judaism from intelligent people who, in Wise's opin- ion, should have acted more responsibly. It is against this background of disappointment and animus that Wise forcefully argued that only inveterate 126. Ibid. 127.

This momentary religious setback for Wise by no means extinguished his undying faith in the anticipated spiritual triumph of Judaism. Only one week after his detailed and lengthy exposition as to why Judaism would not attract Christians over the next twenty-five years, Wise encouraged his Jew- ish readers to take heart. "Be careful, men at the helm," he wrote, "for the time is rapidly approaching when Judaism will again exercise its influence upon the reconstruction of the world's religion. Be cautious, in order to be ready for the great work whenever your services shall be wanted. Be pre- pared with strong convictions, and with sufficient learning and skill to express them well. The day is coming."'28 The precise time of Judaism's influence and ultimate supremacy was left to the undefined future, but of its inevitable arrival, Wise had no doubt. In the few instances in the 1880s when Wise wrote anything on Unitar- ianism, he continued to emphasize the Christian nature of this religion, rather than to stress its similarities to Judaism as he had done in earlier decades. In part, this reflected his awareness of substantial Unitarian loyalty to the person of Jesus and the "Christian" name. But also, Wise attempted to refine his distinction between Unitarianism and Judaism so that adherents of both religions would understand the fundamental religious points of view separating them. During the 1880s, some Jews and Christians were apparently beginning to confuse Unitarianism with Reform Judaism and to assume that their reli- gious and theological beliefs were identical. This is not too surprising given the increasing incidence of Reform-Unitarian pulpit exchanges in the 1870s and the somewhat platitudinous and gushing sentiments advocating the common belief in reason, justice, God, progress, and millennial hopes which emanated from the pulpits on such occasions. As early as 1870, one Chris- tian lady, wife of a prominent Superior Court Justice, remarked upon hear- ing Rabbi Max Lilienthal's sermon in Vickers' Church: "We all will yet become Jews."'29 In the 1880s, some of the more prominent Reform rabbis such as Emil G. Hirsch, Solomon Schindler, and Solomon H. Sonneschein felt constrained to clearly distinguish their religion from Unitarianism. They 128. AI, June 14, 1878, p. 4. Emphasis added. 129.

Indeed, at times, Reformers and Unitarians were challenged by people of radically diverse backgrounds to merge. Thus, in 1869, the clerical Christian right in Chicago, including its Christian missionaries, proposed that Unitarians unite with Reformers and not let "the small matter of cir- cumcision stumble their minds."'30 Twelve years later, Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch had to underscore the theological divergences between Reform Judaism and Unitarianism and to reject a suggested merger of Reform with the Western Unitarian movement as unfeasible.'"' And, in the aftermath of the Reform Pittsburgh Platform of 1885, Felix Adler-who had left Judaism and the Jewish community and founded the Society for Ethical Culture- also proposed a fusion between Reformers and Unitarians in light of their common religious beliefs.132 These trends served as the general background for two very striking arti- cles Wise wrote in July 1886 comparing Unitarianism and Judaism.'33 But these essays also reveal that he was reacting to two more immediate events. In April, 1886, Rabbi Solomon H. Sonneschein of St. Louis, a close friend and colleague of Wise, ventured to Boston to meet with Minot Savage and other Unitarian officials to inquire about the possibility of obtaining a Uni- tarian pulpit should he resign his synagogue pulpit. Experiencing difficulties with a faction of his Shaare Emeth Temple, Sonneschein was exploring job opportunities. Nothing practical resulted from these meetings, but when they finally became public knowledge, the resulting furor in the American Jewish community lasted through the summer months. Shaare Emeth estab- lished a board of inquiry in June to determine exactly what had transpired between Sonneschein and the Unitarians and disseminated a circular on the affair to some rabbis posing the following question: Is a rabbi who sought to serve a Unitarian church fit to lead a synagogue? Besides the specific issue raised by this episode, as well as questions pertaining to Sonneschein's char- acter and motives, the more general concern it pointed to was simply this: 130. Jewish Times, March 19, 1869, pp. 6-7. 131. The Index, May 19, 1881. 132. See Kraut, From Reform Judaism to Ethical Culture, p. 219; also, the American Hebrew, Dec. 4, 1885 which published Adler's call, and the same paper, Jan. 15, 1886 through Feb. 26, 1886 for Rabbi Gustav Gottheil's reply. Nathan Glazer has suggested that such a merger was not so far-fetched, but Glazer has overstated the case. See Nathan Glazer, Ameri- can Judaism, 8th ed. (Chicago, [1957]; reprint ed., Chicago, 1968), p. 53. 133.

Wherein do the religions really diverge? With Sonneschein mentioned in both his articles, clearly the affair was in the back of Wise's mind as he wrote his two essays delineating the distinctions between the two religions.134 Wise also followed closely the inner religious debates within the Western Unitarian Conference which came to a head at its Cincinnati Conference held May 11-16, 1886. Organized in 1852, and considered more radical than Eastern Unitarianism, the Western Conference nonetheless experienced the same basic tension endemic to Unitarianism: how precisely to articulate its relationship to Christianity in view of a concomitant commitment to total religious freedom and openness to all religious points of view. By 1886, two ideological wings had developed within the Western Conference, each of which vied for control. At the Cincinnati meeting, the more radical wing of William Channing Gannett gained the upperhand, and by a vote of thirty- four to ten, the delegates passed a resolution expressing the total religious inclusiveness of the Western Unitarian Conference: ". . . the Western Uni- tarian Conference conditions its fellowship on no dogmatic tests, but wel- comes all who wish to join it to help establish truth, righteousness and love in the world."'35 Wise's two essays took into account these internal divisions within Unitarianism as he tried to define the essential nature of its religious orientation. Reminiscent of his 1866 declaration of Jews and Unitarians as "spiritual cousins," Wise again labeled them "cousins" because of their common anti- trinitarian stance and belief in one sole sovereign of the world. But in con- trast to his earlier description, he now stressed the limits of this "cousin- ship." A great gulf separated Jews and Unitarians: Unitarians still main- tained they were Christians-Jews clearly did not; Unitarians still looked for religious inspiration to Jesus and the New Testament-Jews had alter- nate sources of truth; and, a "considerable number of cardinal doctrines and principles peculiar to Judaism, as, for instance, the covenant, revelation, law, and mission of Israel" separated the two groups. This last motif, in par- ticular, represented a new emphasis which he had not previously enunciated. To be sure, these differences did not prevent "good understanding and mutual respect between the two denominations" since both were committed to such essential points as intellectual freedom, truth, righteousness, love, 134. Given his friendship with Sonneschein, Wise treated the episode gingerly. See A I, July 2, 1886, p. 4; July 9, 1886, p. 4, and Sept. 17, 1886, p. 4. 135. See Wright, pp. 84-89.</page><page sequence="43">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 221 and the "uprooting of intolerance, fanaticism, and mental bondage." There- fore, the "relation of cousinship was well grounded and established," but "there our relationship ends."136 Wise averred that Jews could never be Unitarians. They could not join the Eastern Unitarian denomination because it repeatedly reaffirmed its Christian character at Unitarian National Conferences. "It is self- understood that a Jew could not become a Christian Unitarian without becoming a renegade to Judaism." But Jews also could not join the Western Unitarian Conference because, with Gannett's resolution, that wing of Uni- tarianism, according to Wise, ceased to be a religion and had transformed itself into a purely humanitarian society. Ignoring not only all connections with Christianity, that resolution welcoming all who affirm love, truth, and righteousness, "ignored the very idea of an ecclesiastical or even theistic foundation." The promulgation of love, truth, and righteousness in the world was only one religious principle, but the pillars of religious expres- sion-the soul's yearning to worship God, the human yearning for eter- nity-these and others were deleted. No man could live without them. Wise therefore asserted that a Jew could "co-operate" with these radical Unitar- ians without thereby reneging on Jewish commitment, but could not "affili- ate" or "identify" himself with them "without renouncing, or professing to have renounced, the most essential principles and doctrines of his Judaism." In reality, Wise continued, Jews stood no closer religiously to Western radical Unitarianism than they did to the more Christian Eastern branch. The Western Conference adopted no criteria by which to establish what truth, love, and righteousness were, and therefore every individual's opinion in these matters was equally true and untrue. Consequently, this lack of established authority helped deny Western Unitarianism the status of reli- gion, since "religion theoretically means the authoritative definition of what is truth, what is righteousness, what is love, and what is their negative; reli- gion practically means to know, believe, and conscientiously reduce to prac- tice those very definitions.""'3 In Wise's estimation, the orientation of West- ern Unitarianism was directly antithetical to Judaism, since Judaism was based "upon the highest possible authority, revelation in harmony with the postulate of reason and the demonstration of three thousand years of his- tory." The Jew therefore "knows what is truth, what is righteousness, what 136. AI, July 16, 1886, p. 4, and AI, July 23, 1886, p. 4. 137. AI, July 16, 1886, p. 4.</page><page sequence="44">222 BENNY KRAUT is love, theoretically and practically; and the Unitarian cannot define either. ... The Jew can be no Unitarian."'38 Parenthetically, Wise remarked that Sonneschein could not be charged with apostasy, because if he had attempted to join the Unitarians, it was the radical branch, with no Christianity in it, which he had considered.139 And if he had actually affiliated with it, and sought to establish truth, love, and righteousness in the world, "it would certainly be no crime, but it would be a sham, a self-delusion or an imposition." Wise felt that Sonneschein certain- ly understood truth, love, and righteousness according to the teachings of Judaism and, "being an honest man," he would have expounded these ideals accordingly. But then he would have disseminated "Judaism under the false color of Unitarianism, and either deceived himself or others, who would suppose they were hearing the teachings of Unitarianism, while in fact they would be taught Judaism." At worst, Sonneschein could be charged with deception. In effect, Wise rose to his colleague's defense by concluding that "no man of principle would sail under a false color."'40 Wise ended his second essay with a novel proposal, at least partly in jest, for those Jews whose religion really was identical to humanism, that is, for those Jews "believing that to do good to man is all that is required of man." On practical grounds, he suggested that these Jews join the Freemason movement and change their congregation into Masonic bodies rather than affiliate with Unitarianism. The Masonic movement was much larger than the Unitarian one; it also had "established principles, with a history to back it" and was "well versed in the mission to establish truth, righteousness and love in the world." Yet, Jews were not really prepared for this step, Wise exclaimed, because they recognized that Judaism was not tantamount to humanism. Thus they could not join the radical Unitarians either: "... the Jew can be no Unitarian, because Unitarianism is by far no Judaism yet. We can afford to wait till our cousins shall come to us."'41 It matters little that Wise really did not fully comprehend the ideological or personality tensions within Western Unitarian ranks and the profound theistic and even Christian sympathies of the radicals. The Western Unitar- 138. AI, July 23, 1886, p. 4. 139. Ibid. Wise should have been more precise. Even though he was located in Boston-the East, home of "Christian" Unitarianism according to Wise-Minot Savage, whom Sonne- schein went to see, was one of the most radical Unitarians in the country, Westerners included. 140.

Gannett was a "reverent theist"l42 who, in an 1887 meeting of the Western Conference, offered an omnibus resolution which meshed the 1886 resolution with a new declaration of "Things Most Commonly Believed Today Among Us" which passed by a vote of fifty-nine to thirteen. Gannett acknowledged that with few exceptions Unitarians "may be called Christian theists; theists, as worshipping the One-in-All, and naming that One, 'God, our Father'; Christian, because revering Jesus as the greatest of the historic prophets of religion."'43 Wise was simply determined to demon- strate and underscore one fundamental idea: Under no circumstances could the Jew become a Unitarian and retain allegiance to Judaism. The differ- ences between Unitarianism and Judaism were clear, distinct, and radical, and even the more humanitarian posture of Western Unitarianism, as Wise understood it, did not bridge this gap. In 1890, Wise responded to an individual who had equated Judaism with Unitarianism and again noted the fundamental, qualitative distinctions between them.'44 He argued that the historical record of Judaism and its his- torical process of development over time constituted rational evidence for its superiority over Unitarianism. (Interestingly, Wise did not here refer to the revelation of the Decalogue at Sinai to support Judaism's religious authority which he had consistently done in almost all of his writings on the subject; his stress on history undoubtedly reflected the impact of the evolu- tionary thinking of his age.) Judaism had a history of three thousand years, he recounted, and it developed in all lands, all civilizations, and religious, social, political and philosophical climates. "That which is peculiarly and specifically Israelitish" was not the product of a few speculative minds or of speculation at all. Rather, it was "the product of history, growing naturally out of human nature, with those millions who started and proceeded on their long journey of development with the loftiest conceptions of monothe- ism, and the theological, metaphysical and ethical doctrines legitimately derived from this first principle, and realized in the lives, forms, and institu- tions of those millions, all of which withstood all vicissitudes, all influences from abroad." This pattern stood in marked contrast to Unitarianism which was the product of a few speculative minds which did not result from the "natural growth of the masses" and which had "not been tested in the cruci- 142. Wright, p. 87. 143. Cited in Wright, p. 89. 144. AI, Oct. 2, 1890, p. 4.</page><page sequence="46">224 BENNY KRAUT ble of history's wild and stormy process, being too young for all that." Therefore, Wise concluded, when it comes to a question of "firm and ratio- nal authority," "Judaism stands as high above Unitarianism as the sun above the moon, and is as much more reliable as is the promontory than the sandbank." Moreover, Judaism was not to be identified with Unitarianism because their conceptions of the "first principle" differed. Wise now introduced a subtle theological distinction which he had not made previously. Hereto- fore, he had concurred that Jewish and Unitarian perceptions of the one antitrinitarian God were identical. Now, he remarked, that the "Living God of Israel is simply one," "Echad," and His attribute is "oneness" corre- sponding to the German "Einheit." This one God "is not composed of ele- ments, parts or persons, and there is no God besides him." In sharp con- trast, the "Unitarian God is Unity," and unity and all its derivatives- union, unified, united-always implies composition and combination, the direct opposite of oneness. Wise drew significant historical and theological lessons from this differentiation. Starting with a positive revelation, Judaism "abides by the oneness; ... Unitarianism, starting from trinitarianism, could only think of the negative unity, i.e., the God who is no Trinity. But that is not God. He may, according to this attribute, be a duality or even composed of an infinite number of elements, parts and persons. Therefore, as far as we have heard and read, Unitarianism has no definite idea of Deity and is with the one wing akin to Agnosticism [Western Unitarian Confer- ence] and with the other wing an uncertain negative of Trinitarianism [the National Unitarian Conference of the East], with some indefinite ideas of Jesus and the Holy Ghost blended somehow with monotheism." Pragmati- cally, therefore, he proclaimed, "the doctrines, precepts, institutions and forms growing out of the first principle of the non-conception of Deity [the Unitarian] could at no time be identical with those growing out of the posi- tive conception of Deity [the Jewish]." Wise's analysis is replete with errors about Unitarian theistic belief and again reveals real lack of familiarity with or appreciation of Unitarian theo- logical thinking. In effect, he set up a straw man only to demolish it. Unitar- ian theists did not believe in a composite God and, no less than Jews, had a definite idea of God as single, sovereign, and one. Unitarian repudiation of trinitarianism did not result in a new philosophic abstraction of Unity (of composite parts); this observation reflected more Wise's specious reasoning than historical reality. Wise was much nearer the mark when in later years, he remarked that it was the "leadership of Jesus" which ultimately estranged</page><page sequence="47">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 225 Reform Jews from Unitarians.145 That, and not such rarified theological nuances, differentiated one group from the other. His analysis, however, is neither important nor accurate as an explanation of theological distinctions. Rather, it should be taken as indicative of his attempts in the last two decades of his life to dissociate Reform Judaism unequivocally from its lib- eral Christian Unitarian counterpart. "Judaism is not Unitarianism and Unitarianism is not Judaism," he proclaimed. Perhaps the unsophisticated "non-reasoners" may "identify in principle" Unitarianism and Judaism. But the intelligent segment of the population, the reasoners, "must see pri- ma vista the difference in the systems, in all their ramifications." Conclusion: Religious Triumphalist Over the course of his lifetime, Isaac Mayer Wise's perceptions of Uni- tarianism changed as his understanding of the denomination's evolving reli- gious direction and theological postures deepened. From an early youthful anticipation that Unitarians would support his Jewish weekly newspaper through a later expectation that these most liberal Christians would soon acknowledge their religion as Judaism, Wise came to realize the significant religious beliefs and fervid religiohistorical loyalties standing between Jews and Unitarians. He sensed that while Unitarians and Jews could join forces in the sociopolitical arena on key issues relating to the separation of church and state, while they could work in concert against varieties of orthodox, authoritarian religions to insure religious and intellectual liberty, while they could even occupy the same lecture platform and exchange pulpits to affirm common beliefs in the "Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man," there nonetheless existed clear limits to the theological rapprochement between liberal Jews and Christians. Interestingly, Wise's changing attitude to Unitarianism illustrates a fas- cinating paradox of nineteenth century American religious liberalism: reli- gious liberals were most parochial and narrow when preaching their most universal and liberal ideal, the coming of an all-inclusive "religion of humanity" which would embrace all mankind in the future. The essential character and central affirmations of this universally shared religion, as out- lined by Jewish and Christian religious leaders-the Fatherhood of God, the 145. AI, March 3, 1898, p. 4.</page><page sequence="48">226 BENNY KRAUT Brotherhood of Man-appeared identical. Potentially, this vision of a future religious unity might have led to concrete unification of religious liberals professing the same ideal. In reality, however, Jewish and Christian teleolo- gical portraits only fostered and assured the continuation of religious cleav- ages between Jewish and Christian forms of religious liberalism in the present. The reason for this paradoxical phenomenon is not too difficult to dis- cern. Religious liberals were no more free from a theologically rooted reli- gious triumphalism than were their coreligionists of more conservative religious orientations. A certain measure of denominational religious tri- umphalism was present in both the Unitarian and Reform Jewish promulga- tion of the "religion of humanity," and the overwhelming majority of these religious liberals who avowed religious universalism found religious justifi- cation for remaining within the broad framework of their own religious tra- dition or specific denomination. Invariably, the universalism which they propounded reflected their own conception of the universalization of their interpretation of liberal Christianity or liberal Judaism. Each group identi- fied the best and purest form of religion as its own and claimed to be its legitimate bearer until the advent of the millennium. Individuals whose com- mitment to a religious universalism which compelled them to transcend their religious roots-men like Felix Adler who stepped out of Reform Judaism and Francis E. Abbot who left Unitarianism-represented the exceptions which proved the rule. Certainly this triumphal pattern was true for Wise. Often characterized as a "religious universalist,"'46 he might better be portrayed as a "religious triumphalist." At the very least, for Wise, universalism and triumphalism represented two sides of the same coin. "Religious universalism" as applied to him is accurate in that it conveys his belief that a modern denationalized Judaism would be universally accepted and universally acknowledged as true. But the phrase tends to obfuscate the deep seated "we're number one" psychology that underlay his religious teleology. In his descriptions of the religious future, it was not so much the prospect of a religion universally adopted that excited him as much as the fact that that religion was to be spe- cifically Judaism and no other: Ultimate religious unity meant victory for Judaism. 146. See Andrew F. Key, The Theology oflsaac Mayer Wise (Cincinnati, 1962), p. 59; also, see Heller, pp. 625, 657 in which the author stresses Wise's belief in a universal religion but fails to appreciate his triumphalism.</page><page sequence="49">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 227 Wise reiterated in all his published writings as well as in his sermons and (American) Israelite editorials that Judaism was the only realistic religious alternative to atheism, and that it would prove "dominant," "victorious," "triumphant," and heir to a magnificent "destiny."'47 These terms and the ideas they suggested were not merely dramatic homiletical devices intended to rouse the congregants and readers, although they undoubtedly must have achieved that end at times; rather they truly represented the cherished feel- ings of a man jealous and zealous for the glory of Israel. Wise's religious triumphalism was rooted in and nourished by an impassioned and inde- structible allegiance to Jews and Judaism. This allegiance shaped the con- tours of his interpretation of the Jewish past and future and generated the spirit animating his multifarious involvements in practical Jewish affairs of the day. He felt driven to preserve some form of Judaism and constructive Jewish life in America at all costs. This was a sacred task, a consuming pas- sion and abiding commitment from which he never wavered. His methods may have oftentimes precipitated or heightened tensions within American Jewry and may have stimulated a volley of polemics and ill will within Reform Jewish circles as well as within the broader Jewish community. Con- temporary scholars have questioned his judgments and religious ideology, have derided his inconsistencies, and have labeled him an opportunist, com- promiser, and pragmatist.'48 Even if accurate, these characterizations of 147. For examples of his triumphalist attitudes, refer to Isr., March 7, 1873, p. 4; AI, June, 14, 1878, p. 4; AI, June 13, 1879, p. 4; AI, Oct. 24, 1879, p. 4. Note that this sense of triumpha- lism pervaded both the general tone and style of his writing and went beyond his selection of specific words and phrases. On his view that the only real religious alternative to atheism was Judaism, see Isr., March 28, 1873, p. 4, and AI, Oct. 17, 1889, p. 4. 148. See Rubinstein, especially pp. 53-56, 74, and passim. Such characterizations of Wise are often unhelpful and misleading because they fail to appreciate the significance of his reli- gious triumphalism to explain the motivations or reasons behind his inconsistencies. For example, some of his apparent intellectual inconsistencies can be explained as a result of his devout loyalty to Judaism and his triumphalist religious orientation. Thus, he accepted biblical criticism when applied to the New Testament, but rejected it as invalid with regard to the Hebrew Bible. This inconsistency reflected not so much the lack of sophistication or intellectual blindness on his part as it did a legitimate, tangible fear that his entire system of religious authority, based on the revelation at Sinai and the Decalogue, would be undermined. For Wise, a totally humanized Bible was simply untenable. It would be interesting to discover why Wise could not accept a reinterpretation of revelation, such as Geiger's, to avoid this problem, but he clearly did not. See Wise, "World of My Books," p. 143. On Geiger, see Kraut, From Reform Judaism To Ethical Culture, pp. 62-63; also, Nahum M. Sarna, "Abraham Geiger and Biblical Scholarship," and Michael A. Meyer, "Abraham Geiger's Historical Judaism," in Jakob J. Petuchowski, ed., New Perspectives on Abraham Geiger (Cincinnati, 1975). See too, Michael A. Meyer, "Universalism and Jewish Unity in the Thought of Abraham Geiger," in Jacob Katz, ed., The Role of Religion in Modern Jewish History (Cambridge, Mass., 1975). Similarly, Wise</page><page sequence="50">228 BENNY KRAUT Wise, nevertheless, reveal a man devotedly at work for the sake of a revital- ized, triumphant Israel. One simply cannot deny Wise's wholehearted com- mitment to the upbuilding of American Judaism or dismiss his impressive accomplishments. For Wise, the glory of Israel was magnified by the simultaneous, thor- ough demolition of Christianity. He derived intense emotional satisfaction from his perception that a heretofore powerful dogmatic Christianity was losing its hold in the modern world and that the quintessentially Jewish reli- gious, moral, and intellectual doctrines of Judaism would one day acquire religious dominion. By the late 1870s, he extended his harsh critique of Christianity to liberal Christianity as well. While he conceded that even dog- matic Christianity may have enlightened non-Jews with ethical teachings, these were in substance really Jewish;149 certainly, Christianity, even in its liberal forms, had contributed nothing to Judaism.' o Despite his protes- tations to the contrary, his almost gleeful, triumphal defiance of Christian- ity-as if he had a "Jewish chip" on his shoulder daring any Christian to knock it off-must have offended many Christians, liberals and conserva- tives alike.'1 embraced science and reason, but when others used scientific conclusions to cast doubt on his religious beliefs such as revelation, immortality and the like, he opposed the evidences of science with the evidence of a three thousand year historical Jewish experience which he judged the stronger on such matters as he felt were beyond the ken of science. And by resorting to the tradition of six hundred thousand adult male Jews having stood at Mt. Sinai to demonstrate the event's historical facticity, Wise sometimes gave the appearance of a nineteenth century Judah Halevi defending his faith against Judaism's detractors in both the rationalist and Christian camp. See AI, Dec. 1, 1876, p. 4; Heller, pp. 519, 526-27; Knox, pp. 155-56; Wise, A Defense of Judaism, pp. 20-22. It was the attempt to harmonize his commitment to the religious trium- phalism of Judaism with the intellectual demands of the modern age which made it impossible for Wise to work out a coherent religious ritual practice. 149. Wise, A Defense ofJudaism, pp. 31-49, and Judaism and Christianity, p. 43. 150. Wise staunchly opposed the attitude expressed by Felsenthal, citing Abraham Geiger, that the one reform for which the world and Judaism remains indebted to Christianity was the "deliverance from the yoke of the ceremonies. This reform, and solely this one, Judaism of our days has to imitate." To Wise, Judaism was not indebted to Christianity for anything. See the Jewish Times, March 12, 1869, p. 11. For David Einhorn's attitude, similar to that of Felsen- thal, see Jewish Times, June 18, 1869, p. 2. 151. Compare Moritz Ellinger's diatribe against Wise for the "shameful manner" and utter disrespect in which "he assails a sister religion," Jewish Times, Aug. 26, 1870, p. 409, with Wise's own assertion of respect for Christians, but not for Christianity, Isr., Sept. 2, 1870, p. 8. Wise later consistently affirmed respect for Christianity as well as for Christians. See his Judaism and Christianity, p. 43 and A Defense of Judaism, p. 3. He also claimed that he lost no Christian friends because of the tone and nature of his attacks on Christianity; see his "World of My Books," p. 138. This latter claim is simply inconceivable, and must be viewed with con- siderable skepticism as must his claim to have "induced all of liberal Christianity to adopt a friendly and brotherly attitude towards Judaism." Ibid.</page><page sequence="51">JUDAISM TRIUMPHANT 229 Ultimately, therefore, Wise's attitudes to Unitarianism and liberal Christianity were largely determined by his personal and Jewish religious triumphalism-and therein lay the basis for the limited nature of his theo- logical accomodation with Unitarians. When he interpreted Unitarianism to be judaizing, that is, coming closer to his perceptions of pure Judaism, he lauded the denomination's growth as a "sign of the times." He welcomed the Unitarians as true "spiritual cousins" merely differing in their sources for commonly held religious truths. Their religious liberalism played a valued role in his ideological conception of religious progress and his anticipation of a not too distant messianic age. When, however, he encountered what he understood to be Unitarian retrenchment within Christian lines, he still retained respect for individual Unitarians,152 but depicted Unitarians gener- ally as "cousins" whose substantive differences in religious doctrines and sources clearly demarcated their religion from his. Perhaps the style and tone of Wise's trimphalism as applied to Unitarianism were distinctive, but its essential drift or central idea was typical of nineteenth and even twentieth century Reform thought."53 For their part, Unitarians, no less than their Reform counterparts, mani- fested a religious triumphalism of their own, and they emphasized the his- toric Christian ties through which fundamental universal religious ideals were derived. Their spokesmen also evaluated Jewish religious liberalism in so far as it approximated universally held religious ideals considered their heritage. Thus, for example, the Unitarian Rev. Robert David Collyer, upholding a more pristine Christianity over and against dogmatic Orthodox Christianity, praised Reform Judaism because "rationalistic Judaism is nearer in its tenets to primitive Christianity than the Christianity of the Orthodox churches."'54 Wise, of course, would have reversed the claim and would have suggested that primitive, predogmatic Christianity was simply Judaism with the addition of a few symbols for the pagans. Isaac Mayer Wise was prototypical of those Jewish and Christian reli- gious liberals who made so much of religious universalism, yet who exhib- 152.

Parallels to Wise's changing attitude to American liberal Christians appear in Europe as well. For exam- ple, Abraham Geiger, for a time, held high hopes for the emergence of a religion of humanity from within Liberal Protestantism. When he realized that this would not be forthcoming, he came to believe that only Judaism could reshape itself as the religion of the future. Cf. Michael A. Meyer, "Universalism and Jewish Unity in the Thought of Abraham Geiger," especially pp. 100-1. 154. Jewish Times, March 19, 1869, p. 6.</page><page sequence="52">230 BENNY KRAUT ited a form of religious triumphalism that sought to claim the prestige of victory for the universalization of commonly held ideals that were defined as their own. The application of the label "Jewish" or "Christian" was crucial to these individuals."'5 It reflected not only their sincere scholarly under- standing of the true origin of such ideas, but also and perhaps more so, their irrevocable emotional attachments to their historic religious ties and descent.'56 So long as these loyalties to their historic religious family per- sisted, the theological rapprochement between Jews and Unitarians was necessarily circumscribed. Oddly enough, yet understandably, it was mutually exclusive forms of religious triumphalism which separated reli- gious liberals such as Wise and other Jewish Reformers from their Unitarian counterparts, just as contrary religious triumphalist claims separated all reli- gious liberals from the more conservative denominations within their respective religions.

See Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman's statement in 1928 introducing a Christian clergy- man's sermon at his temple: "You teach Christian ethics-I teach Jewish ethics. There is no dif- ference between the two. What you call Christian character, I call Jewish character." Pamphlet, An Account of a Historic Exchange of Pulpits Between Rabbi and Minister, p. 6, in Ferdinand M. Isserman, Nearprint Box, Biographies, American Jewish Archives. 156. An excellent example of Jewish triumphal expression can be found in Rabbi Leo M. Franklin's response to a paper by Julian Morgenstern, "Were Isaac M. Wise Alive Today," Yearbook of the Central Conference of American Rabbis 29 (1919): 251. Franklin's comments in this series of Wise Centenary Addresses actually exemplified Wise's own attitudes: "We are 'Judaizing' the Christianity of today ... for the modern movement of the religious world ... means simply that those ideals for which the Jew through all the ages has been struggling, have become the common property of all humanity-and that instead of fighting single handedly for Justice and Truth and Brotherhood . . . the Jew will henceforth call to his standard to fight for his ideals, the brain and brawn of the Christian world. It is the token of Judaism triumphant." Franklin argued that this type of "assimilation" was welcome.</page></plain_text>
