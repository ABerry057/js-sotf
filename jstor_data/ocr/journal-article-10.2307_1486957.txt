History, Religion, and Antisemitism. Berkeley: Univer- sity of California Press, 1990. x, 380 pp. What is antisemitism, when did it start, and why? For three decades medieval historian Gavin Langmuir has focused his scholarly energies on these vital questions, and the two volumes here under review present the fruits of his investigations. Toward a Definition of Antisemitism assembles fourteen of Langmuir's essays (all but three published previously) on hostile attitudes toward Jews in medieval Christendom, on the shortcomings of modern historiographical treatment of antisemitism, and on proposals for conceptualizing antisemi- tism more profitably. The ordering of the essays reflects neither the chronol- ogy of their subjects nor that of their composition-Langmuir's 1960 paper "'Judei nostri' and the Beginning of Capetian Legislation," marking his initial unanticipated entry into the field of medieval Jewish history, appears sixth on the list-but their author's agenda for confronting and responding to the questions at hand. Antisemitism has suffered from neglect in the dominant traditions of modern Western historiography (chap. 1), and from</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 309 the religiously grounded biases (chap. 2) of those Jews and Christians who have sought to chart its annals. Particularly in the wake of the Holocaust, one does well to differentiate between the blatantly irrational hatred of a Hitler (antisemitism) and socioculturally more accountable-and less extraordinary-varieties of prejudice against Jews (anti-Judaism). Lang- muir distinguishes further between Christian anti-Judaism and the prejudi- cial traditions of classical antiquity which preceded it, inasmuch as the former weighed much more heavily in the world view of its proponents. "For Christians, the ability of Jews to maintain their own identity was not only annoying or hateful in the way ethnic differences so often are; it was an intimate and enduring threat to their sense of identity, a challenge built into their own religion" (p. 7). As antiquity gave way to the Middle Ages, anti-Judaism (chaps. 3-4) continued to function significantly in European culture, lending itself to vio- lent expression when Christian religiosity nurtured aspirations that found no fulfillment within existing social structures, as in the case of the First Crusade. Still, while granting the novelty of the 1096 massacres, Langmuir rightly emphasizes that the violence proceeded primarily from religious, not economic, considerations. Those Jews who underwent baptism escaped de- struction; for Jews had attracted the wrath of crusaders because of their Judaism and their refusal to accept Christianity. Anti-Judaism and the harm which it wrought had thus proceeded from matters of fact; or, in the words of the author, "the Jews who died in 1096 to sanctify the Holy Name at least had the satisfaction of . . dying for what they were proud to be: Jews who chose martyrdom rather than apostasy, not helpless victims of a collective delusion" (p. 301). Yet the period of the crusades also signaled change in the nature of anti-Jewish prejudice. Singled out by crusaders, theologians, and legislators alike for their nonconformity and their insecu- rity (chaps. 4-7), Jews came to bear the brunt of widespread Christian anx- iety as a constellation of political, economic, and scientific changes trans- formed the character of medieval civilization. Change enkindled doubt vis- a-vis the fundamental beliefs of Christian faith, most notably the sacrament of the Eucharist; repressed on a conscious level, such doubt resulted in a host of fearful, irrational fantasies concerning the infidel of Christendom par excellence. Western antisemitism accordingly began in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when Jews came to be persecuted not for what they were-those who refused Christianity-but for what they were not (chaps. 8-13): ritual murderers and cannibals, desecrators of the host, well-</page><page sequence="3">310 BOOK REVIEWS poisoners, etc. Langmuir finally applies a taxonomy of varieties of prejudice to the results of his inquiry (chap. 14). Distinct from the largely realistic, ethnocentric Jew-hatred of pagan antiquity and the xenophobic anti- Judaism of patristic and early medieval Christianity, antisemitism reflects a chimerical form of prejudice, that which attributes "to outgroups character- istics that have never been empirically observed" (p. 336). The quest for a vocabulary with which to make social scientific sense of antisemitism-in a word, to define it-provides the link with Langmuir's new monograph, History, Religion, and Antisemitism. This book departs from the premise that modern historians of religion in general and of anti- semitism in particular must free themselves of the preconceptions of their subjects in order to develop legitimate, objective explanations of the past. The religious individual's own understanding of the essence of religious experience ought not to constitute the foundation of critical scholarly dis- course on religion, just as Jewish and Christian explanations of antisemitism cannot suffice for the social scientist investigating the history of anti-Jewish prejudice. Thus driven to ground his analysis of religion and antisemitism in "rational empirical thinking" (p. 46), Langmuir wades through a mass of scholarly treatments of religion and ultimately proposes to define it (p. 136) as "those elements of religiosity that are explicitly prescribed by people exer- cising authority over other people," and religiosity (p. 160) as "the salient patterns or structure according to which the individual human organism consciously correlates all the diverse processes occurring within the organ- ism with those that surround and impinge on it in order to develop, main- tain, and ensure the coherence and continuity of the distinctive elements of its identity." Religious doubt in turn arises either from the conflict between appealing and/or prescribed beliefs (nonrational doubt) or from that be- tween received beliefs and perceptions of reality (rational empirical doubt). Nonrational religiosity yields to irrationality when individuals repress the latter form of doubt-that is, when they totally deny the empirical reality challenging their faith. "More than that, not only do they refuse, or are un- able, to acknowledge the knowable characteristics of certain realities, they also project on them, or attribute to them, characteristics that the realities do not possess, attributes that are the creation of their own nonrational thinking and express their sense of their own identity" (pp. 255-256). Hence the basis for antisemitism's appearance in high medieval Chris- tendom: the growth of religious doubt which, when repressed in various social circles, resulted in the irrational projection onto the Jews of all the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 311 opposition to Christian faith which Christendom had generated in itself. Even as traditional forms of Christianity later yielded to modern "phy- siocentric" religions, the pattern of antisemitic projection remained, along with many of the specific stereotypes which medieval antisemitism had spawned. The transition from psychocentric to physiocentric faith in fact only aggravated the phenomenon. Since "physiocentric religions are based on beliefs about unobservable material processes whose existence is sup- posed to be immediately demonstrated by what is observably going on immediately here and now" (p. 317), they lay greater claim to rationality, are more subject to empirical challenge, and are more productive of irration- ality. The horrors of Hitler's Final Solution testify only too well to the vita- lity of antisemitism in a post-Enlightenment, positivist Christendom. Toward a Definition of Antisemitism and History, Religion, and Antisemi- tism offer a learned, literate, and refreshing new look at antisemitism and its treatment in modern scholarship. A master of historical research and his- toriographical detective work, Langmuir has assembled a formidable array of medieval and modern sources on Christian-Jewish relations, prejudice, and religion with which to develop his case. This merits far more extensive consideration than that for which a brief review allows; I can here hope simply to highlight several concerns evoked by these volumes-in the theory, the methodology, and the specific historical explanations of their arguments. As noted above, History, Religion, and Antisemitism (along with several essays in the other work) proceeds from the author's stipulated need to dis- tinguish in social scientific terminology between antisemitism and other per- ceived forms of religious/ethnic and even anti-Jewish prejudice; the categories and definitions proposed by the author in response to this need then come to govern the discussion and evaluation of anti-Jewish prejudice. Paraphrased rather crudely, the argument might run as follows: Remember- ing the extermination of much of European Jewry by Hitler's Third Reich, the author feels impelled to classify in academic terms what strike him as the most salient characteristics of the Nazis' anti-Jewish program. These he finds in the irrationality of their prejudice, grounded in doubts about them- selves, their value system, and their world, and resulting in the projection of absurd, pernicious fantasies onto the Jews and their culture. He labels this variety of prejudice antisemitism, finds the first evidence of such a phenome- non in the anti-Jewish behavior of twelfth and thirteenth-century Euro- pean Christians, proceeds to classify earlier anti-Jewish prejudice as essen-</page><page sequence="5">312 BOOK REVIEWS tially different (i.e., anti-Judaism), hurriedly summarizes the entire history of anti-Jewish prejudice in accord with this distinction (as in History, Reli- gion, and Antisemitism, pp. 275-346), and arduously seeks a definition of religion and religiosity to explain it. Langmuir's research has shed considerable light on many chapters in the history of anti-Judaism/antisemitism, and any caricature in the previous paragraph does not intend to detract from due recognition of his contribu- tion. Rather, my paraphrase seeks to highlight the personal, or self- referential, basis for the author's inquiry. For someone else might well discern other distinguishing characteristics in particular manifestations of anti-Jewish prejudice, move on to define antisemitism differently, present a correspondingly divergent history of Jew-hatred, and, as the numerous defi- nitions of religion (by Weber, Durkheim, Otto, Eliade, Stark and Bain- bridge, Berger, Geertz, Bellah, et al.) rejected in History, Religion, and Antisemitism suggest, arrive at an equally compelling understanding of reli- gious experience. Indeed, one senses at times (pp. 8 ff., 129 f., 147, 349 ff., etc.) that History, Religion, and Antisemitism is in part the intellectual auto- biography of a historian of antisemitism. This is hardly undesirable. Its bearing on the applications of the volume's theoretical model simply demands acknowledgment. Much the same can be said concerning methodology. Langmuir pro- fesses an uncompromising faith in a critical objectivity appropriate to modern historical scholarship-specifically, an insistent distinction between the scientific explanation of past phenomena and rationalization deriving from the historian's subjects themselves-and admits its determining influence on his perspective: "I have no desire to make elements of my own religiosity a religion, other than my commitment to rational empiricism" (History, Religion, and Antisemitism, p. 129). And alongside rational empiri- cism stands a stated preference for the perspective of the cognitive scientist over that of the semiotician or literary critic. Langmuir sees little value in the historiography of religion grounded in the religious identification of the his- torian (see esp. Toward a Definition of Antisemitism, chap. 2). He has repea- tedly stressed that his ultimate concern lies not with Christian or Jewish texts, knowledge, ideas, and acts, but with the behavior and psychology of real human beings (see his article in American Historical Review 91 [1986]: 623-624). Again, one might grant the legitimacy of such an approach and still</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 313 question its claim to superiority over others. Furthermore, while History, Religion, and Antisemitism makes occasional mention of referentially focused theories of textual criticism, it fails to grapple with the problems of interpreting medieval texts which comprise evidence of anti-Judaism and/or antisemitism. If one seeks to understand the hatred of Jews within the matrix of medieval Christian culture, how does one evaluate the cultural meaning, value, and significance of a document? How can one move directly from story to putative event, simply assuming, for example, that the events of 1096 in the Rhineland occurred just as the Hebrew crusade chronicles recount them? How can one gauge the importance of Christian anti- Judaism in a real historical context without analyzing the Hebrew literature of the medieval Jew alongside that of the Christian? Such questions have become commonplace in various realms of scholarly discourse which these volumes sidestep, but this avoidance does not eliminate the validity of the questions. Any reconstruction of the past on the basis of its literature requires a methodological framework for determining meaning, and this too must be justified. Its positivist ring notwithstanding, the hermeneutical dis- course of Langmuir's "rational empiricism" entails no less of a Gadamerian fusion of horizons than the "ethnocentrism" (History, Religion, and Antise- mitism, p. 51) which the author discerns in much of modern Jewish historio- graphy. As a medievalist, it is in Langmuir's treatment of the Middle Ages that I find his opus most engaging and illuminating. The link between medieval Christian doubt and anti-Jewish fantasy, demonstrated so insightfully in the three new essays in Toward a Definition of Antisemitism (chaps. 5, 8, 11) and explored more theoretically in History, Religion, and Antisemitism, contri- butes amply to our understanding of how and why Christian attitudes toward Jews and Judaism changed during the twelfth and thirteenth centur- ies. Langmuir might have made his case more effectively in a single, more comprehensive synthesis of the separate medieval studies in Toward a Defini- tion of Antisemitism. But this is not criticism of its substance, which, like the best of modern empirical scholarship, induces us to consider old questions afresh.
