<plain_text><page sequence="1">Adele Berlin. Biblical Poetry Through Medieval Jewish Eyes. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991. xvii, 205 pp. Adele Berlin's book comprises lightly annotated English translations of texts by eighteen Jewish authors on aspects of biblical poetry and poetics. The Hebrew and Arabic texts span about eight centuries and are culled from writings of diverse genres. Most of them have been collected previously, and they have also been the subject of a major analytical study (see p. 4), but only a few have been available in English before. The texts are introduced by a desultory overview of the issues with which they are concerned.</page><page sequence="2">80 BOOK REVIEWS Some may wonder whether a translation of this material was necessary. One might argue that premodern Jewish literary theory is of interest mainly to specialists in the history of Jewish thought, who will be able to read it in the original languages. Adele Berlin suggests, on the contrary, that her anthology "should be of interest" to both biblical scholars and literary scholars, "for different reasons" that she does not expound. In her view, access to the texts contained in the volume will enhance modern literary-critical study by "mak[ing] us more appreciative of earlier attempts ... to apply poetic theory to the Bible" (pp. ix-x). Given that the book's purpose is to introduce a corpus of recondite texts to an audience of nonspecialists, a reviewer need not focus on its contribution to scholarship, but on the quality of the translations and of the context that the author provides for understanding them. This brief review can provide only a small indication, by way of a few examples, of the work's shortcomings in those areas. Berlin presents two texts by Joseph Ibn Kaspi, one of which is his brief introduction to Song of Songs (pp. 105-107). Since this text is concerned with hermeneutics rather than with poetry or poetics as such, the reason for its inclusion is unclear.' In the middle of the selection there is a passage that Berlin singles out as an example of "the interplay between issues and views which seem modem and those which seem hopelessly outmoded" (p. 5). The passage in question begins as follows:2 ir")" 'I ?yt X;7 ;1"Y 7 R xhnn ,1"2y:1, "lrlrn 1'"37rxy1 ' tr iO I -n,'1 n ' 1"Y, ,Inl ;*1) nr rX -I o) "nt v "nwil1 non *nz Mtp nn ?n "ln In7=I lulatvD ;*1) *nvw "nwNl .1yt ,nlbn ;MIDI 1,1 107 " 15o) In w "ntX a nn *,n "nnta 1 -11m 71ITI?r Tr " i?a , n 1. On the other hand, one misses such texts as the surviving fragment of Saadiah's poetics (in N. Allony's edition of the pain [Jerusalem, 1969], pp. 386-389); also Meiri's important remarks on the difference between "i, and 5vn (in the introduction to his Proverbs commentary, ed. M. Meshi-Zahav [Jerusalem, 1969], pp. 5-8), ignored in the discussion of the topic on pp. 33-35. With the notable exception of the Abravanel selections (pp. 119-133), n~mtr is excluded from the anthology. The author asserts that "discussions of poetry were not apt to be found in commentaries" (p. 10). It would have been useful, nonetheless, to cite instances of such expressions as D1?i nyu and 1') SD---especially when they are associated with stylistic elegance (mnny); also Ibn Ezra's controversial comment on Qohelet 12:9, where he may be implying the existence of metrical poetry in the Bible.

The first is entirely open and literal, with nothing beyond this-this is called "all silver." The second is entirely hidden, with nothing revealed, having only metaphors and imagery-this is "all gold." The third has both hidden and revealed [i.e., literal and figurative meanings]-this is called "apples of gold." The translation misses the mark completely. In the first place, the ref- erences to Proverbs 25:11 should have been noted and explained, with mention of Frank Talmage's splendid treatment of the subject.3 But the more fundamental problem is the failure to disclose Kaspi's source: the introduction to part I of Maimonides' Guide4 is certainly one of the most famous passages in Jewish literature, but it is not likely to be familiar to the average biblical scholar or literary critic. And Kaspi's terminology needs to be understood not in a vague "literary-critical" manner, but in the light of Maimonidean usage. Kaspi's fti? and "ino reflect Ibn Tibbon's rendering of Maimonides' Inmw't t=11, "external and internal." This fact is confirmed by Kaspi's use of min, another Tibbonism (lain = ,mt ). Berlin translates %,*a1 inconsistently as both "open" and "revealed," neither of which is correct (it means "external" or "exoteric"). Then she compounds the problem by having Kaspi characterize the "nno as consisting of "metaphors and imagery" (p'rT,r lu), as if they were poetic figures rather than the Maimonidean ,lnn--the prophetic "parable" that contains "wisdom concerning the truth as it is" (nm i m~ nin vorn ~ni Next Berlin proceeds to misrepresent the text's content: "Ibn Kaspi is concerned with differentiating genres, for, as he explains, and as literary scholars and biblical Form Critics know, one cannot understand the meaning of a passage if one does not know its genre and the conventions of that genre" (p. 5; cf. pp. 32-33, 101). The last clause is unexceptionable as a general 3.

But the statement has nothing to do with Kaspi, whose comments are not concerned with genre even by the most capacious definition of the term. In the passage following the above-quoted text, Kaspi describes the act of W0,1V as arriving -morn Vnn nfn i nl'n -TY. Berlin seizes upon that statement to make the following remark: "Ibn Kaspi is also concerned with the original intention of the author, something rejected by the New Criticism as the intentional fallacy yet not entirely dispensable to most biblical scholars" (p. 5; cf. p. 101). It is difficult to comment on such a sentence. Suffice it to say that Kaspi's -nM has nothing to do with "intention" as defined in the classic literary-critical essays of Wimsatt and Beardsley, and that the New Criticism did not reject "the original intention of the author." What Berlin intends to say about the attitude of biblical scholars toward intentionality ("not entirely dispensable") is obscure. The other Kaspi text in the anthology is the introduction to the so-called second version of his Proverbs commentary. A brief portion of this text will provide further illustration of the difficulty of presenting this kind of material to nonspecialists. Once again Kaspi is reflecting on exoteric and esoteric interpretations:5 The translation (p. 102): When it says "To save you from a strange woman" [Prov 2:16], and "Here comes a woman to meet him" [Prov 7:10], and all that follows this, Solomon did not intend to refer throughout this whole book to matter and form. There is a note on the words "matter and form" that reads as follows: "That is, to an esoteric thought disguised as a commonplace" (p. 106, n. 5). The translation and its accompanying note betray a poor command of Kaspi's language, intention, and context. Using the standard philosophical antithesis of matter and form, Kaspi alludes to and rejects the allegorical interpretation of the t t nt as the seductiveness of the material world-Iinanni 5.

As these examples indicate, all too often the author shows an inadequate grasp of her corpus in the context of arnz' and Jewish thought. Berlin's desire to make these texts accessible to nonspecialists may be laudable, but the weaknesses described above preclude my recommending this book to them.
