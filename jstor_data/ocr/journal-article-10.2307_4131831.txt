Madison: Universi- ty of Wisconsin Press, 2004. xiii, 360 pp. For a half-millennium until the 1940s, the history of Poles and Jews was in- extricably intertwined. In particular, from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Poles and Jews alike were faced with sweeping economic and social changes that challenged-even threatened-livelihood, traditions, and identity. One way in which both Jews and Poles attempted to make sense of "modernity" (to use the word as shorthand for industrialization, secularization, and the communications revolution of this period) was to subscribe to one or another form of socialism. In the Polish lands, socialism and nationalism were never mutually exclusive, indeed on the whole, the two movements overlapped considerably. Again, this was just as true for Jews (Bund, Poalei Tsiyon) as for Poles (PPS). Josh Zimmerman's impor- tant book examines relations between the two most important pre-1914 Polish and Jewish socialist parties, the Bund and the PPS. Both parties aimed simultaneous- ly to pave the way for international socialism and to develop their respective na- tions (Jews and Poles). Both parties rejected national chauvinism or prejudice, ar- guing in a Herderian vein that only when each nation developed its full potential could true internationalism reign. Despite their theoretical agreement, however, the parties frequently clashed on practical issues. Examining these practical dif- ferences, Zimmerman has much to tell us about the nature of being Jewish, Pol- ish, and/or socialist in late imperial Russia. The two central heroes of this story are, as said, the Bund and the Polish So- cialist Party (PPS). Both aimed to spread socialism throughout the Polish lands and both rejected any kind of exclusivist nationalism. But herein lay the rub: the PPS wanted to consider all denizens of the region as potential Poles on a political lev- el at least. It would be wrong-very wrong indeed-to accuse the PPS of exclu- sionist nationalism. Indeed, the problem was exactly the opposite: the Polish so- cialists wanted to include Jews (and, at least potentially, Lithuanians, Belarusians, Ukrainians) within their political nation. The PPS also clearly stated on numerous 190</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews occasions its commitment to cultural rights (e.g., use of native languages, includ- ing in schools). While one may view the PPS's relations toward non-Poles as based on questionable assumptions and overly optimistic, chauvinist, or overtly "polo- nizing," it was not. Neither did the Bund see the nation as an unchanging entity and a value above all other sociological categories. Indeed, Zionists (and others, including Si- mon Dubnow) accused the Bundists of fomenting class hatred within the Jewish community. But for the Bundists, Jewish culture (not necessarily religion) did rep- resent a cherished value and one they were dedicated to protecting and furthering. Thus for both practical and ideological (one could almost say "spiritual") reasons, Bundists rejected the appeals from the PPS (and the Russian social democrats) for closer organizational relations. The Bund's rocky relationship with the Russian so- cial democrats (and Lenin) is rather well known, but actually less interesting than the Bund-PPS relations that Zimmerman examines here. Although Lenin and the Russian social democrats were in organizational terms arch-centralists and intol- erant of even the concept of a Jewish nation, the PPS's views on the subject were considerably more nuanced and friendly. It is this complicated and, in a sense, trag- ic relationship that forms the center of Zimmerman's study. This book makes important contributions to our knowledge in several re- spects. First, it provides an excellent overview of the parallel development of Bund and PPS conceptions of nationality, in particular as this concept was applied to Jews. Secondly, based on careful readings of party platforms, press, and corre- spondence combined with ajudicious use of archives, Zimmerman establishes that the PPS position on the "Jewish question" could not fairly be described before 1914 as "assimilationist." Finally, Zimmerman's work illuminates an oft-neglect- ed aspect of Polish-Jewish relations. For all the squabbling and disagreement be- tween the Bund and the PPS, they agreed on fundamental issues of toleration, the need for cooperation between national groups (not subordination, as the Russian socialists implicitly demanded), and respect for Jews as a cultural group. If more Polish political movements (and thinkers) had expended as much energy in at- tempting to find a modus vivendi between Poles and Jews in a future Polish state, the history of the interwar republic would likely have be considerably happier. To be sure, one can always quibble with certain conclusions. For example, Zimmerman's reliance on party platform statements may make him underestimate the level of "creeping assimilationism" among Polish socialists. And there are, as always, some errors, for example, Vilna University was not closed in 1869 (p. 26), polu-inteligenty would probably be better translated as "quasi-intellectual" than "worker intellectuals," and it was not a "PPS-Bund alliance" (but wealthy and on the whole conservative electors) that helped elect a socialist to Warsaw seat in the fourth Duma (p. 272). Still, these are small matters. This book is an important work that deserves to be read by anyone interested in the history of Jews, Poles, or na- tionality in Europe. Theodore R.
