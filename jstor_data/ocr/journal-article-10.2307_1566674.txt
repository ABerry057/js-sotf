Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. x, 265 pp. Israel is an intensely political and literate society in which writers are often asked to comment on the (recurring) issues of the day, and where daily routines are often carried out against a backdrop imbued with a sense of drama. One would think that theater, the most political of all genres, would be the perfect outlet for cultural expression, yet until recently theater has been considered one of the least developed areas of Hebrew literature, and its study has been the most neglected. Glenda Abramson has made impressive strides in addressing this neglect, first in her earlier work, Modern Hebrew Drama (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, 1979), and now in her current study. Abramson starts at a potential disadvantage in conducting this research from outside of Israel, thereby missing out on the significant component of performance. She is aware of this, noting at the beginning of her book that she is focusing on drama rather than theater, emphasizing the textual analysis over performance and experience. This distinction is at once limiting and liberating. The author's stated aim is to acknowledge the texts' "value as documents that reflect extra-theatrical social reality" (p.13). She observes that reactions to political theater are generally ideological and not aesthetic, and that once writers are labeled political, they have difficulty in ever shedding or transcending the label. Abramson's stated purpose largely confines her to a similar stance. Fortunately she does not limit herself as strictly as her introduction may suggest, and both performance and aesthetics are considered. The definition of political drama at the heart of this study is very Israeli. The plays under discussion deal with Zionism, its interpretation, expression, and current status. While the author defines her subject as "original works which deal one way or another with the social and political problems of Israeli society" (p. 9), plays by women who "tend also to view social realities from a personal perspective, offering individual response to the same national problems" (p. 8) are omitted from the discussion (including Edna Mazya's drama based on a kibbutz gang rape). The personal may be political, but not in Israeli culture. Except for briefly treating plays that helped create the Zionist master narrative, this study favors the literature of dissent. Critiquing the national ethos and mythos</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 153 is seen as political, but establishing or promoting the same is not (this may be the reason for the dearth of works from the right). It is perhaps this perspective on what is political that helps us define what is Israeli about the body of work, even more so than Abramson's assertion that it is the added moral dimension. The genre of political theater demands extraliterary knowledge of the audience (whether reader or spectator), as Abramson notes. To this end she begins with a three-part introduction. The first part offers a dense survey of Israel's short history, focusing on the development of Zionism, from the publication of Herzl's The Jewish State through the Intifada. The second part then covers the history of Hebrew drama. Abramson concentrates on the development in the Land of Israel rather than the Russian roots of the genre (see, for example, Mendel Kohansky, The Hebrew Theatre: Its First Fifty Years, 1969). This first chapter concludes by offering a bird's-eye view of the theater scene in Israel, considering state subsidy of theater and the question of audience. For the most part, the Israeli theater-going audience is not unlike its counterparts in other (read Western) countries: middle- aged, educated, high-income. Additionally, the majority of Israelis buying tickets to plays are also secular and Ashkenazi or Israeli-born. Zionism sits at the center of Abramson's introductory material because it also sits at the center of the master narrative and the national myths. Issues of gender, racism, sexual orientation, and class (except for embourgeoisement as the failure of Zionism) are barely considered. Central political events give rise to new forms and themes. The book points to the wake of the Six-Day War as the beginning of satirizing the hero from the previous generation, and to 1972 for the dawning of the enfant terrible. (While the reason for this date is not directly addressed, the author implies that the premiere of Kenan's Friends Talk About Jesus ushered in the new era.) The targets of political theater noted here include the ideology of sacrifice (epitomized in Shamir's He Walked in the Fields) and war, the means of collective mourning and-later-the materialism of the mainstream (Israeli Ashkenazi) middle class. Recurring issues include the Holocaust, the conflict between religion and the state, and the Palestinian question. Arab characters, as in fictional works, are often incorporated as symbols rather than as characters in their own right. But more and more this seems to be changing. (In fact, Naomi, a one-woman show staged at the Akko Festival of fringe theater earlier this decade, subverts the typical use of Arab-as-</page><page sequence="3">154 BOOK REVIEWS symbol. In this play the character of a Palestinian woman says something about the status of women in general. Abramson does not include this play in her study, as her focus is on works performed by mainstream theater companies.) The book's strongest chapters are those that concentrate on fewer plays, linked either by themes or playwrights. While Abramson treats Hanoch Levin as the enfant terrible par excellence of Israeli theater, commends Nissim Aloni for his ability to transcend Israeli particularism, and analyzes Mittlepunkt's use of the past to comment on the present, it is Yehoshua Sobol who comes to dominate the book, and especially his play Ghetto. (A scene from the play appropriately graces the cover.) The Holocaust as event and as literary subject brings to the fore the myths regarding the founding of the state, the image of the new Hebrew, Israel's military and moral superiority. The very many plays dealing with the Holocaust in the canon, and the attention paid to them even in this study, belie the assertion of a limited response to the Holocaust in Israeli literature. By the end of the 1970s, Abramson notes, the Holocaust had become an integral part of the Israeli perception of history. It is curious that this is true a generation removed from the actual historical events, and also among those born in countries far away. While presumably contributing to the centrality of the Holocaust, these plays challenge the culture of victimhood. Moral ambiguities color the dramas. Here Abramson offers a reading of Sobol's masterful play as a "metaphor for the ideological conflicts of the 1980's" (p. 179), yet the metaphor is not fully spelled out. The play traveled well, she observes, garnering a strong reception in Germany and the United Kingdom. Her conclusion that its reception was less positive in the United States is based on one review (albeit by Frank Rich) regarding one production. (Philip Boehm directed a very successful staging of the play in St. Louis in 1997.) Consideration of the play Ghetto and the questions raised by its staging in Germany naturally leads to a discussion of the theatrical experience Arbeit Macht Frei in Todland Europa, an interactive drama about the Holocaust. In dealing with this play, originally presented at the Akko Fringe Theater Festival, Abramson goes furthest beyond analyzing the written text to ask probing questions about performance and reception.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 155 Her discussion makes it clear that the issue of response cannotbe ignored in a study of political drama. This is true as well in the case of Mittlepunkt's drama Gorodish, a docudrama taking on a military hero. Abramson points out the curious misreading of the play that has allowed it to become a popular choice for schools and youth groups. The response to these plays is as interesting as the works themselves. While Abramson acknowledges the imperative to interpret response within a political context-"it has to be said that media comment on the original drama is often conditioned by critics' political views" (p. 12)--she gracefully declines to characterize the critics' politics. Abramson is an astute reader herself; I would like to have heard more of her voice. Too often it seems that she accepts someone else's pronouncement. Surely she does not need Michael Handelsaltz to judge Levin-a playwright whose works include onstage vomiting, the title "Shits," and characters endowed with gross flatulence-as having crossed the "boundary of good taste." Surprisingly--or is it an encouraging sign?-in a volume surveying political drama the issue of censorship is mentioned only a handful of times. (Civil theater censorship was abolished in 1991.) "Creators of political drama still function within the same ideological framework as that of national consensus" (p. 56), she states. So do audiences and critics. This is yet another reason to commend the author of this work coming from the outside-yet with much of the literary and extraliterary knowledge of those on the inside-for offering this carefully researched study of drama and ideology in Israel. This book is a welcome addition to the slight but growing body of work in English about Hebrew theater that includes her earlier book, and Kohansky's, and Linda Ben Zvi, ed., Theatre in Israel (1996). Furthermore, though abridged, the bibliography will provide a valuable resource for anyone wishing to read further. Nancy E. Berg Washington University St. Louis, Missouri</page></plain_text>
