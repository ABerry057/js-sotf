Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 2001. 323 pp. (Hebrew, English precis) Talmudic chronology is an uncertain science. Aside from stray data here or there in the Talmud, there are only two sources: Seder Tanna'im ve-'Amoraim and 'Igeret Rav Sherira Gaon. Both are Geonic, separated by centuries from the Amora- ic period. Moreover, they deal mainly with heads of yeshivot (or perhaps master- disciple circles), not with individual Amoraim. Avinoam Cohen's revision of the dating of the sages named Ravina and of a few other Babylonian Amoraim who functioned during Rav Ashi's time (d. 427) and afterwards is a closely reasoned study and, as such, a paradigmatic work of talmudic historiography. Through painstaking readings of Talmudic passages and medieval commentators, Cohen takes issue with the regnant dating of those Amoraim and, in arguing for his revi- sions, explains how to identify historically relevant information in talmudic sugy- ot and how to utilize it. The traditional view is that one Ravina was extremely long lived. He studied under Rava (d. 352) and again under Rav Ashi, as an older talmid-haver (disciple- colleague). This Ravina would have had to live another seventy years beyond his age at Rava's death (352-before 427). It would stand to reason that he predeceased Rav Ashi, and a line in the version of Seder Tanna'im ve-'Amoraim in Mahzor Vi- try as well as a passage in Rabbenu Hananel's commentary on Mo'ed Katan 25a-b support that notion. Cohen claims that Rava's disciple and that of Rav Ashi are two, and he demonstrates the errors of the aforementioned sources. Cohen thus adds a second Ravina, a young student of Rav Ashi who died after the latter. This revision contributes to the solution of another conundrum, namely, the identification of Ravina, the Amora who, along with Rav Ashi, concluded the cen- tral Amoraic Talmudic process: hora'ah (TB Bava Metsia 86a). Previous theories had held that the final Ravina (bar Rav Huna), a sage who lived after Rav Ashi and died between 475 and 501, was the one who brought hora'ah to a close. This led to confusion and made problematic the identity of Rav Ashi. Cohen's second Rav- ina as a young talmid-haver to Rav Ashi makes good chronological sense as Rav Ashi's partner in closing hora'ah, and still leaves room for the final Ravina. Cohen's demonstration is cumulative, carefully built up over several pains- taking analyses. Thus, he shows that sugyot in which Ravina apparently contradicts himself make sense if two Ravinas are understood. He calls attention to the achronological presentation of sages in sugyot, a phenomenon he had noted else- where.1 This allows him to establish consistency in the representation of the two Ravinas, taking into account the exigencies of logical presentation on the ideation- al level. Social data demonstrate the unlikelihood of the latter being Rava's Ravina, for example, the fact that Rav Ashi accords respect to Amoraim older than him- self, including those younger than the Ravina who studied with Rava, whereas he 1.

Moreover, Cohen shows that Ra- vina Rava's student lived in a town near Mehoza (where Rava taught), and engaged exclusively in agricultural pursuits, whereas Ravina Rav Ashi's disciple lived near the latter's home (Mata Mehasya), and trafficked in wine, money, and loans, as well as agriculture. They were two different people. Previous hypotheses regarding Ravina affected the dating of other Amoraim. He is also associated with Rav Aha. When it was thought that the final Ravina was the only one alive after Rav Ashi, Rav Aha was dated late. Now Rav Aha can be seen as relating to the second Ravina. Furthermore, it was unclear whether a Rav Aha (without a patronymic) can be identified with Rav Aha bar Rav or Rav Aha bereh de-Rava, and whether the two with such similar patronymics are identical. Cohen noticed that one is always mentioned before Ravina, whereas the other al- ways comes after him in sequences of names. Viewing this consistency of repre- sentation in terms of the rule that the elder Amora (or the one who died first) is always enumerated before the younger one (cited simply as yaduda-"well- known"-on p. 173) allowed Cohen, having taken into account textual variants and parallels, to differentiate between the latter two Amoraim (Chapter 6). There are some areas in which one may disagree with Cohen's assumptions or reasoning. For example, his appeal to achronological presentation of Amoraim in discussion as support for his identification and differentiation of the two Rav- inas might strike a reader as circular reasoning. His acceptance of Talmudic data, for example, descriptions of dialogue as a maga' hai (living interaction) may seem naive. However, the arguments are cogent even if the text as formulated does not reproduce unmediated the ipsissima verba of the interaction. Moreover, intensive examinations of textual evidence such as this counter the contemporary notion that most attributions in the Talmud are suspect, whether as pseudepigraphs or due to the vagaries of tradental and scribal error. On the other hand, Cohen's acceptance of a citation formulation like 'amar leh (he said to him), as opposed to 'amar (he said), at face value as clear evidence of a maga'h ai (living interaction), is prob- lematic because of confusion in the manuscripts. This work could be a first stage, a methodological prolegomenon that serves as foundation for an intellectual history of the late Amoraic period. Differentiat- ing further between the various Ravinas and the three Rav Ahas, Cohen could pro- duce intellectual-halakhic biographies that enrich our understanding of the attitudes, ideas, and methodologies current among the late Amoraim in all their di- versity. Moreover, through his interest in the relations between teachers, students, and colleagues Cohen may be in a position to make a contribution to the current debate about the nature of the academic setting in the later generations of the Baby- lonian Amoraic period, despite the fact that of the 900 citations of Ravina in the Talmud, only those that contextualized Ravina in dialogue with another Amora aid- ed in dating and differentiating the collocutors. But perhaps Cohen can build on his present findings to develop methods to further distinguish between the authors of more of those other statements. Clearly thought through and formulated, this book merits (and requires) careful reading and consideration: chapters end with appendices, and footnotes are 331</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews full of information and judicious analysis.
