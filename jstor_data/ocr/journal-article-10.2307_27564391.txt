Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2007. xviii, 200 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001487 In the introduction to his 1919 anthology, the modernist poet Zishe Landoy consigned all American Yiddish poets preceding him to "an episode in the labor movement" (42). As Marc Miller suggests in his provocative new book, Repre senting the Immigrant Experience: Morris Rosenfeld and the Emergence of Yiddish Literature in America, Landoy thus initiated a perception of Morris Rosen feld that remains little changed today. Indeed, Rosenfeld, one of the most popular and beloved Yiddish poets, continues to be associated with the "sweatshop" or "proletarian" poets, a group known for privileging the message of social protest over the poetic medium. While other critics have explored the special status Rosenfeld enjoyed among Yiddish readers, they have similarly downplayed Rosenfeld 's aesthetic achievements, foregrounding instead the authenticity of his depictions of Jewish immigrant life. Whether dismissed as a "propagandist" or celebrated as a "representative of the people," Rosenfeld has not been regarded as an artist. His poems have been "revolutionary" or "genuine" but never literary. Miller's study of Morris Rosenfeld takes a critical step toward correcting this view. Determined to expose the "anti-Rosenfeld biases" that have led to the poet's marginalization in Yiddish scholarship and letters, Representing the Immi grant Experience presents Rosenfeld as a singular literary artist (62). For Miller, the category of "sweatshop poets" is misleading, as it has obscured the distinctive ness of Rosenfeld 's individual career as well as his poetry. As the biographical opening chapter reveals, this distinctiveness extends to the poet's professional ambitions and his ability to gain the support of patrons and the attention of a non-Yiddish-speaking audience. Further, in synthesizing the varied critical approaches to Rosenfeld, Miller highlights how Rosenfeld became a figure through whom readers negotiated important questions about Jewish identity, including whether Jews constituted a nation and what a Soviet Jewish culture ought to look like. 467</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Miller's most compelling challenge to prevailing images of Rosenfeld as a member of the labor party's "rhyme department" is, however, in his identification of a shift in the poet's oeuvre from early "ideological" and "propagandistic" verse to carefully crafted poems that portray the everyday struggles of his fellow immi grants in the shops and tenements of New York's east side. In contrast to the revo lutionary rhetoric and rousing optimism of his early work, Rosenfeld's "mature" poems are highly pessimistic about the possibility for change. In Miller's opinion, these works represent the height of Rosenfeld's artistic achievement and, as such, become the focal point of his discussion. Through close analysis of some of Rosenfeld's best-known poems, Miller succeeds in presenting Rosen feld as a sophisticated literary artist whose poems operate according to specific aesthetic principles. In doing so, Miller effectively challenges the usual distinction between modernist "artists" and their "ideologue" predecessors. Although Miller singles out the New Critics for inaugurating a trend of favoring modernism in poetry, the legacy of which he sees in contemporary Yiddish scholars' marginali zation of Rosenfeld, his own impressive readings draw on New Critical techniques in their emphasis on the formal complexity of Rosenfeld's poems and their effec tive use of imagery and verse form. Noting the variety of literary conventions in which the poet was conversant and exploring the poet's deliberate and stylistically effective use of daytchmerish, Miller makes a convincing case for Rosenfeld's creation of a "new and original aesthetic in Yiddish literature" (72). While intent on treating Rosenfeld from a "literary" perspective, Miller's actual line of argument leads him to draw conclusions about the relationship between Rosenfeld's art and its historical context. This secondary objective is evident in the book's title, Representing the Immigrant Experience, which promises a discussion of how Rosenfeld's poems offered audiences a particular way of under standing the Russian Jewish immigrant. Miller suggests that Rosenfeld portrayed laborers and their families as passive and helpless, as this "reflected" or "mirrored" the changing immigrant experience. That is, the poet was responding to his own despair and the growing sense of "apathy" among a Yiddish immigrant community that had grown increasingly skeptical that radical movements could alleviate their conditions (149). Here, Miller's sweeping claims would have been strengthened by providing some historical evidence from recent scholarship on the Jewish working class in America. Indeed, while Miller offers readers a richly textured image of the poet, his interpretations could be further strengthened by acknowledging the complexity of some of the key concepts he employs. For example, Miller does not consider the vast body of scholarship devoted to the practice of representation, which explores the way literature both reflects and departs from lived reality and drawn attention to the way a writer's choices are circumscribed by considerations of audi ence and publisher. In a similar fashion, Miller's use of "ideology," which here has a wholly negative value and seems somewhat synonymous with rigid political belief, does not reflect the way the term is conceptualized in much contemporary criticism. Still, Miller's discussion of Rosenfeld's use of the conventions of sentimentality makes an especially important contribution to the study of Yiddish poetry. Drawing on Joanna Dobson's discussion of sentimentality in mid-nineteenth-century American writing, Miller makes, albeit implicitly, a strong case for the Americanness of 468</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Rosenfeld's verse. However, in his assertion that Rosenfeld's "mature" poems were "depoliticized" and "sentimentalized," Miller takes for granted an antithetical relation ship between the realm of politics and a set of literary conventions designed to evoke an emotional response (91). Here, Miller might have cited scholars in American litera ture who have engaged in vibrant debate about the kind of cultural work sentimental literature accomplishes. For example, Jane Tompkins and Phil Fisher have linked sen timentality to a politics of activism and resistance. Such readings of sentimental re presentations argue that by portraying individuals as despairing and helpless, readers begin to feel a sense of injustice that encourages them to initiate a program of social change. Other readings of sentimental literature have argued that in its focus on the impossibility of change, sentimentality has been complicit in racial, gender, and class oppression. Extending such a reading to Rosenfeld could prompt readers to ask whether, in their portrayal of a capitalist economic system as inevitable, the poems were complicit in class oppression. In his brief concluding chapter, Miller leaves his readers with an array of questions about Rosenfeld: What accounted for his unique popularity among Jewish workers? Why did he become the object of so much opprobrium on the part of critics? How did he become representative of the people? In raising these questions, Miller suggests rich possibilities for future study and the impor tance of attending to Rosenfeld's very different audiences. While the single-author approach and lack of engagement with scholars in related fields lends Miller's study an insular feeling, his work poses a convincing challenge to readings that have denied Rosenfeld's artistic ability and highlights new avenues for the exploration of the Jewish working class and its literature.
