<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 27:2 (2003), 227-252 "DESIGNATION IS SIGNIFICANT": An Analysis of the Conceptual Sugya in bSan 47b-48b* by Leib Moscovitz Explicit rabbinic legal concepts and principles-notions such as "multiple causation is prohibited/permitted" (zeh ve-zeh gorem muttar/'asur), "retrospective determination of reality is/is not valid" (yesh/'ein bererah), and the like-occur frequently in the Babylonian Talmud (BT), especially in the later strata of that work.' Most concepts and principles of this sort are applied to a case or two, al- though we sometimes find extended conceptual sugyot in BT that systematically analyze a particular legal principle. Such passages generally analyze a group of tannaitic sources in light of the specified principle, which is assumed to apply to all the cases cited; these cases may be adduced either to support or to refute the relevant principle. The cases addressed in conceptual sugyot are often quite diverse both legal- ly and factually. Consequently, explaining such cases in light of a single principle often entails legal, conceptual, textual, and exegetical difficulties, as the relevant rulings can frequently be accounted for more plausibly on other grounds-for ex- ample, in light of different principles or distinct and localized considerations of narrower scope. Nevertheless, attempting to account for multiple cases based on a single principle often reflects remarkable conceptual creativity, since the scope of the relevant principles is extended to almost every case imaginable. Indeed, such use of rabbinic legal principles as "grand unified theories" reflects rabbinic con- ceptualization at its most innovative and sophisticated, conceptually speaking. In this paper we analyze one such conceptual sugya at some length,2 BT's * My thanks to the Israel Science Foundation (grant #4347) for supporting the research on which this paper is based, and to Mr. Binyamin Katzoff for his research assistance. 1. See generally Leib Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning: From Casuistics to Conceptualization (Tiibingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002), especially pp. 292-342, with extensive references to earlier litera- ture. 2. Various aspects of our sugya and the principles it contains ("designation is/is not signifi- cant") have been discussed by Binyamin De-Vries, Toledot Ha-Halakhah Ha-Talmudit, 2d ed. (Tel- Aviv: Avraham Zioni, 1966), pp. 152-153; Ephraim E. Urbach, Ha-Halakhah: Toledoteha Ve-Hitpattehutah (Givatayim: Yad La-Talmud, 1984), p. 128; and Louis Jacobs, The Talmudic Argu- ment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 122-132. However, none of these studies addresses all of the issues associated with this sugya; hence, the present discussion. 227</page><page sequence="2">Leib Moscovitz discussion of the principle that "designation3 is/is not significant" (hazmanah [flav] milta, bSan 47b-48b). This passage presents numerous textual and concep- tual difficulties, which have not been addressed satisfactorily either by the classi- cal commentators or by modern scholars. Our goals in this paper, therefore, are threefold: (1) to account for these difficulties based on a critical analysis of this passage; (2) to account for the evolution of this sugya; and, above all, (3) to ana- lyze the literary and conceptual character of this sugya and especially the rela- tionship between them. A proper understanding of our sugya requires due attention to its Palestin- ian Talmud (PT) parallels. Accordingly, our analysis commences with a discussion of relevant aspects of these sugyot. This is followed by a discussion of the BT sug- ya and, finally, a summary of the principal conclusions that emerge from our analy- sis of all these sources. The sugya in bSan 47b-48b has three partial parallels in PT. Two of these (yMeg 3.1, 73d and yNed 9.2, 41c) are essentially identical; the third, yYom 3.6, 40c, differs in important respects from the other two. The first two PT sugyot, parts of which have parallels in the third, are not all that important for solving the diffi- culties in BT, although the third is; hence we present this passage here, comment- ing on those aspects of its text, structure, and content which are indispensable for properly understanding the BT parallel.4 (Important features of the other two PT sugyot are considered briefly at the end of section IV.) 1. If leather was tanned for use as an amulet, a. one may write a mezuzah on it. b. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel prohibits this. 2. Rabbi Jose said, We originally thought: About what do they disagree- about non-Temple use [le-hedyot], but not for Temple use [le-gavoah]. From what we have learned: Sacred stones must be hewed in a sacred 3. This translation is not fully adequate; I use it here and elsewhere in this paper for lack of a better term. 4. Certain parts of this sugya, especially the beginning (2-4), are problematic both textually and exegetically. Since much of our analysis of BT hinges on the correct interpretation of the PT sug- ya, we treat the textual and exegetical problems in PT pericope in the following notes (critical aspects of structure and content are generally discussed in the text); see especially nn. 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13. For further discussion, see the classical commentaries ad loc.; the comments of Nahmanides in his Milha- mot Hashem on bSuk 9a (4b in the printed editions of Alfasi); R. Abraham b. Azriel, cAruggat Ha- Bosem, vol. 2, ed. Ephraim E. Urbach (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1947), pp. 45-46, 49-50; and R. David Friedmann, She'elat David (Pieterkow, 1913), Orah Hayyim #3, s.v. 'od sham and ve-cattah "assig (pp. 3b and 4a). Nevertheless, most of the explanations suggested by these scholars are almost certainly untenable, and the correct interpretation is apparently that found in Qorban Ha-'Edah (al- though we occasionally consider possible ramifications of alternative explanations of PT where relevant). 228</page><page sequence="3">"Designation is Significant" place and hewed in sanctity5 ... and Rabbi Hananya said in the name of R. Yassah:6 This is disputed- 3. This implies that [the scholars cited in la-b] also disagree about Tem- ple use.7 4. It was taught:8 "If one made a utensil for sacred use9 [ha-'oseh keli le- gavoah], an ordinary person may use it before it was subjected to sa- cred use; after it was subjected to sacred use, an ordinary person may not use it." 5. But it was taught [in another baraita]: "If one makes a utensil for sa- cred use, an ordinary person may not use it!"'o. .. 5. At first sight this expression might seem to be a doublet, although this is unlikely, since a similar formulation appears in the next sentence (not cited here). For possible explanations of the rep- etition (which in any case does not bear directly on the discussion here), see Penei Moshe and Qorban Ha-'Edah ad loc. and R. Abraham Isaiah Karelitz, Hazon Ish, Orah Hlayyim, Moed (Jerusalem, 1967), Hilkhot Tefillin 6:12, s.v. u-va-qodesh, p. 15a. 6. This is almost certainly a different sage from the R. Jose cited in the beginning of this sec- tion; otherwise, it is impossible to understand how R. Jose disproves his original suggestion based on the dictum cited here. See the next note. 7. As indicated by the breakdown of the sugya as presented here, the Talmud's conclusion is ap- parently based on the statement of Rabbi Hananya in the name of R. Yassah in the previous section, while the next part of the sugya constitutes an independent unit (cf. Qorban Ha-'Edah). Thus, the Tal- mud's point here is that just as the first tanna and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel disagree as to whether leather initially tanned for profane use may be used later for a mezuzah, so too they disagree about whether the Temple stones and vestments mentioned in (2) require advance designation. Accordingly, the barai- ta in (2), though anonymous, is disputed. See further the following notes. 8. The text here reads di-tenei, "as it was taught," implying that the baraita that follows con- tinues the previous discussion and supports the line of reasoning advanced there. However, this inter- pretation does not seem to fit the context, as the material that follows seems to introduce a new and distinct line of argumentation. Accordingly, I have rendered the text as if it reads tenei, "it was taught," the term ordinarily used to introduce an independent tannaitic source. (Our text was emended this way by Ze'ev Wolf Rabinovitz, Sha'arei Torat Eres Yisra'el [Jerusalem, 1940], p. 250, and cf. R. Jehiel Michel Epstein, Mikhal Ha-Mayim ad loc., s.v. amar R. Yoseh, although our reading is confirmed by the citations in Nahmanides [above, n. 4] and R. Abraham b. Azriel, Aruggat Ha-Bosem, 2:46, 49.) In- deed, the term di-tenei is often used in PT to introduce tannaitic sources which have no connection with the previous discussion, and in some of these passages certain witnesses read tenei rather than di-tenei (in our sugya, this reading might have resulted from ashgara from an earlier part of the Yerushalmi where the term di-tenei appears; see above, line 55 in the editio princeps). For additional discussion of this use of di-tenei, see Leib Moscovitz, "Sugyot Maqbilot U-Masoret Nosah Ha-Yerushalmi," Tarbis 60 (1991): 543-544, and the literature cited there. 9. The exact meaning of this expression is not fully clear, although it does not directly bear on the discussion here; see further Saul Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah (New York: 1955-1988), 5:1154, 1158. 10. The next part of the sugya, which has been omitted here, discusses a case which seems like the mirror image of (4): "If one made a utensil for profane use [le-hedyot], the Temple [gavoah] may use it before it was subjected to profane use; after it was subjected to profane use, the Temple may not use it." However, this statement, like the rest of the material omitted here, might just be a corrupt dou- blet (through ashgara) of the previous part of the discussion, as evidenced by (6), which clearly refers 229</page><page sequence="4">Leib Moscovitz 6. R. Huna said in the name of the rabbis from there [=Babylonia], this [second baraita] refers to [a utensil] coming from contributions to the Temple treasury. 7. When do ministering vessels [kelei sharet] become sanctified-im- mediately or upon use?... 8. If stones were hewed for the sake of a dead person ... 9. If one threw a utensil in front of the bier of a corpse ... outside of four cubits, benefit from it is permitted. This sugya contains three principal parts, all of which deal with designation (except for 9, on which see below). For the issue addressed in 1-3 is whether it is necessary to designate objects for sacred use to render them fit for such use (or, perhaps, whether designation for profane use disqualifies certain objects for sa- cred use)."I The issue addressed in 4-6 is whether designation for sacred use ren- ders an object unfit for secular use-in other words, whether such designation takes effect in the same way as actual use. The last part of this passage, too, which has parallels in yMeg and yNed (unlike the other parts of this passage), deals with the question of whether designation takes effect. Now, there is a critical distinction between the types of designation discussed in 1-3 and those in 4-8. For the issue addressed in 1-3 is whether designation for sacred use is necessary, whereas the issue addressed in 4-8 is whether designa- tion is effective, that is, whether designation for ritual use has the same effect as actual use.12 Logically speaking, these are distinct issues: designation might be to a baraita along the lines of (5). Cf. Qorban Ha-'Edah ad loc., s.v. R. Hananyah (and cf. Leib Moscovitz, "Lishanei Aharinei Bi-Yerushalmi," Sidra 8 [1992]: p. 64 n. 8, for similar, though admit- tedly not identical, textual phenomena in PT). In any event, even if this baraita is not a corrupt doublet of material appearing earlier, the issue it addresses is already analyzed in 1. (If this baraita is not a cor- rupt doublet of (4), the term which precedes it in the editio princeps of PT, di-tenei, should presumably be emended, interpreted as equivalent to tenei [cf. above, n. 8], or deleted; note that this term is miss- ing in the body of MS Leiden and was added in the margins there secunda manu. Of course, even if this baraita is not a corrupt doublet of earlier material, the rest of the passage omitted here almost cer- tainly is, as suggested by Qorban Ha- Edah.) 11. Strictly speaking, these issues, which are addressed in separate stages of the discussion (dis- qualification by designation for profane use in (1), and the necessity of designation for sacred use in (2)), are distinct and perhaps even logically independent. Thus, it could be argued that positive desig- nation for improper use disqualifies an object for ritual use, although the absence of proper designa- tion does not; likewise, proper designation of a sacral object might be necessary, although initial designation for profane use might not disqualify the object so designated, provided that proper desig- nation is performed later. Nevertheless, the fact that the Talmud conflates these issues, as demonstrat- ed by the inference in (2)-(3) (at least according to our understanding of these parts of the sugya; see below, n. 12), proves that the Talmud holds that a single issue is at stake here-whether designation for ritual use is necessary, at least in certain cases. 12. According to some commentators (so already Penei Moshe), (3) addresses the same issue as the next part of the sugya-whether designation for sacred use is effective, and not whether desig- nation for sacred use is necessary. However, even if this interpretation is accepted--and it is highly problematic (see the previous notes, although a more detailed analysis of this view lies beyond the 230</page><page sequence="5">"Designation is Significant" necessary to sanctify an object for ritual use, although the object in question might not assume its sacred status until it is actually used. (Likewise, designation might take take effect immediately if performed, although there might be no obligation to designate objects for ritual or other sacred use.) Indeed, although inferences are drawn in different parts of this sugya, no comparisons are drawn between cases discussed in 1-3 and cases in 4-8,13 presumably because the issues addressed in these parts of the sugya are logically independent of one another: these issues are neither explicitly claimed nor implicitly assumed (insofar as we are able to deter- mine) by PT to be contingent upon one another. The question accordingly arises: why were these ostensibly independent is- sues discussed together here? It might be argued that this is the result of superfi- cial association, possibly through late scribal transfer (a common phenomenon in PT),14 whereby what were originally two distinct units, 1-3 and 4-8 (or 4-9; see below), were conflated. However, this suggestion is problematic because 4-6 does not appear elsewhere in PT, and we thus lack evidence of an alternative context from which this part of the sugya might have been transferred to its present con- text. Accordingly, two other explanations of why these issues were discussed to- gether are possible. There is evidence that superficial thematic association of the sort attested here, whereby different parts of a single passage address a common theme, albeit distinct issues, was practiced by the amoraim." (This distinction be- tween theme and issue is essentially the difference between a concept-here, des- ignation-and an assertion predicated of that concept-for example, that designation takes effect or is necessary.) Thus, there is nothing anomalous about assuming that 1-3 and 4-6 were included here as an integral and organic part of the same discussion, since they address a common theme, designation. (Of course, this does not preclude the possibility that 7-9, which has parallels in yMeg and yNed, was transferred here from that sugya.) Alternatively, PT might have been following the lead provided by the Tosef- ta (or a similar baraita), which also juxtaposes diverse issues. (Note that Toseftan baraitot provide the context for other PT discussions as well.)16 Thus, we read in tMeg 2.13, 16 (ed. Lieberman pp. 351-352):'7 purview of the present study)-it is clear that (2) (q.v.) deals with the necessity and not just the effec- tiveness of designation. 13. At least according to our understanding of the sugya; see the previous note. 14. See most recently Leib Moscovitz, "The Formation and Character of the Jerusalem Talmud," in The Cambridge History ofJudaism, vol. 4 (forthcoming), "Parallel Sugyot and 'Foreign Bodies,"' with references to earlier literature. 15. See Yaakov Sussmann, "Ve-Shuv Li-Yerushalmi Neziqin," Mehqerei Talmud 1 (1990): 91, n. 156, and cf. Leib Moscovitz, "Sugyot Mesutatot Ba-Yerushalmi," Te'udah 10 (1996): 43. 16. See pro tempore Leib Moscovitz, "'Od 'Al Ha-Baraitot Ha-Haserot Bi-Yerushalmi," PAAJR 61 (1996): 4-8 (Hebrew section), and Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Com- position, and Culture (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins, 1999), pp. 264-265 and p. 369, n. 65, and the references there. 17. Sections 2-3 have a parallel in tMen 9.21 (ed. Zuckermandel, p. 526); see below, n. 17. 231</page><page sequence="6">Leib Moscovitz 1. [13] If one made an ark or wraps for a [Torah] scroll, before they were subjected to sacred use an ordinary person may use them; after they were subjected to sacred use an ordinary person may not use them18... 2. [16] Before being used by the Temple, sacred vessels [kelei gavoah]19 may be used by an ordinary person; after being used by the Temple they may not be used by an ordinary person. 3. Utensils initially made for an ordinary person may not be made [= used] for sacred use [la-gavoah]. 4. Stones and beams initially hewed for a synagogue20 may not be built in the Temple Mount. This baraita, like the sugya in PT, addresses two distinct issues2--whether designation without use is effective in conferring sacred status (1-2; cf. 4-8 in PT), and whether improper designation (i.e., designation for profane use) disqual- ifies objects for sacred use (3-4; cf. 1-3 in PT).22 Now, it is clear from the Tosef- ta that these issues are not governed by a single, shared principle.23 For designation to confer sacred status does not take effect immediately; by contrast, improper des- ignation immediately disqualifies the relevant objects for sacred use in the future. In any event, whether PT follows the structural framework provided by the Tosef- ta (or a similar baraita) or independently associates the issues it addresses, there is clearly nothing anomalous or conceptually objectionable about the juxtaposition of these issues, since PT draws no inferences from one to the other. Finally, a few words about 9. This case differs from all of the others in our sugya, since the action considered here-throwing objects at a grave-does not seem to entail either designation or actual use. The criterion specified for prohibit- ing such objects is proximity to the legally significant item (here, the grave)-four cubits-rather than functionality. Yet, although this part of the sugya does not ad- dress the same theme as the rest of the sugya, it is easy to understand why this case was discussed here: it follows associatively from the previous case, which deals with other types of prohibitions generated through corpse association-hewing stones for use in a cemetary. As we shall see below, this association-based structure of our passage is crucial not just for PT, but also for a proper understanding of BT. 18. MS Erfurt and the editio princeps include an additional sentence here which is very simi- lar to (2) (see below), but which might refer to Temple vessels rather than to ordinary religious items; see Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, 5:1153-1154. However, this sentence is missing in MSS Vienna and London; therefore we do not cite it here. 19. The parallel in tMen 9.21 (ed. Zuckermandel, p. 526) reads kelei sharet ("ministering ves- sels"); see Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, 5:1158. 20. Other witnesses read "for non-sacred use" (le-hedyot), although this reading does not sig- nificantly affect the argument here; see Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, 5:1160. 21. Even though other laws intervene between sections 1 and 2 of the Tosefta, sections 2 and 3-4 of the Tosefta, which address different types of designation, are contiguous. 22. Note, though, that the Tosefta, unlike PT (see above, n. 1 1), does not explicitly address the issue of whether an undesignated object is acceptable for sacred use, i.e., whether designation for sa- cred use is necessary. 23. Assuming, of course, that the Tosefta reflects a single, consistent viewpoint and was not generated through the conflation of conflicting literary sources. 232</page><page sequence="7">"Designation is Significant" III We now turn to the BT sugya, beginning with a translation of this passage24 (considerably abbreviated because of its length) and followed by comments on sig- nificant aspects of this sugya. These comments focus primarily on difficulties in the sugya, especially difficulties stemming from the Talmud's generally implicit assumption25 that the various prooftexts cited should be interpreted in light of the principles that "designation is/is not significant." (The numeration of these com- ments follows that of the text.) The next section attempts to solve the difficulties noted below, and a summary and broader conclusions appear in the final section of this paper. 1. It was stated: If one wove a shroud for a corpse, Abbaye says: [The shroud] is forbidden, and Rava says: It is permitted. a. Abbaye says: [The shroud] is forbidden-designation is significant [hazmanah milta]. b. Rava says: It is permitted-designation is not significant. 2. What is Abbaye's reason? He drew a verbal analogy [gamar] ... from [the case of] a heifer whose neck is broken26 [ceglah 'arufah, Deut. 21:1-9]: just as a heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited through designation,27 so too [a shroud] ... 3. And what of Rava? He drew a verbal analogy ... from idolatry: just as idolatry ['avodah zarah] is not prohibited through designation, so too here [the shroud] ... 4. Why didn't Rava draw an analogy from ceglah carufah? He would say to you: We infer appurtenances from appurtenances, which excludes ceglah carufah, which is intrinsically sacred... 5. An objection was raised:28 "If a head covering was ritually impure 24. The translation follows the standard printed editions; significant variants are discussed in the notes, although there are hardly any such variants in our passage. (My thanks to Dr. Mordecai Saba- to for allowing me to consult his synopsis of text-witnesses to bSan.) 25. The fact that this principle is not explicitly invoked in most of the discussion is of no sig- nificance for our purposes, as it is clear that this notion underlies the entire discussion. Indeed, failure to explicitly invoke a legal principle subjected to multiple applications in the course of a talmudic sug- ya is not uncommon in BT, and does not necessarily reflect anything about the conceptual character of the discussion. Cf. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, p. 324, n. 128. 26. According to She'iltot de-RavAhai, Shelah, ? 143 (ed. Mirsky, 5:38) and Huqqat, ? 150 (ibid. 5:72), Abbaye's inference might have been drawn from the laws of sacrifices (qodashim), suggesting that the author of that work might have had a different reading in the Talmudic text here. (Note R. Naf- tali Zvi Yehudah Berlin's discussion ad loc., and cf. Yad Ramah on our sugya, p. 46d, s.v. 'ittemar.) However, there is no evidence of such a reading in any of the extant MSS. 27. That is, before it is killed, once it enters the valley where it is supposed to be executed; see ySot 9.6, 24a and bQid 57a. 28. The source cited here seems quite similar to mKel 28.5. However, the reading netanattu le- (see below, n. 30) is not found in any of the major witnesses to the text of this Mishnah; cf. Yaakov Nahum Ha-Levi Epstein, Mavo Le-Nosah Ha-Mishnah, 3d ed. (Jerusalem: Magnes; Tel-Aviv: Devir, 2000), p. 549 (although some of Epstein's remarks here are unclear). These witnesses read netano ~al, lit. "placed it upon," which seems to suggest use rather than designation. The reading netanattu/netano 233</page><page sequence="8">Leib Moscovitz ... and one placed it for29 [netanattu le-,30 i.e., designated] a scroll, it is pure .. ." [implying that designation is significant]!- 6. Say [=emend]: "If one placed [=designated] it and wrapped it." 7. Why are both designation and wrapping necessary? In accordance with Rav Hisda. For Rav Hisda said: If a cloth had been designated for wrapping phylacteries and one wrapped phylacteries with it, one may not wrap coins with it. If one designated [the cloth] and did not wrap [phylacteries] with it, or if one wrapped [phylacteries] with it and did not designate it, one may wrap coins with it. 8. And according to Abbaye, who holds [de-'amar]:3' Designation is sig- nificant- a. if one designated it, even though one did not wrap with it, [it is for- bidden]; b. if one wrapped [phylacteries] with it, if one designated it, it is [for- bidden, but] if one did not designate it, it is not ... 10. Come, hear [mSheq 2.5]: "The surplus of a collection for the dead32 'al- (rather than le-) in the Mishnah is also confirmed indirectly by some Mishnah commentators, who attribute the latter reading to BT, implying that this reading was not found in the Mishnah; see R. Sam- son of Sens' commentary ad loc., and cf. Melekhet Shelomoh. (Melekhet Shelomoh might just have followed R. Samson of Sens, although it is noteworthy that the former cites no other evidence of the reading netanattu le- in the Mishnah.) In any event, it is clear from the content of the sugya and not just from the reading of the MSS that BT read netanattu le- here; see below. Accordingly, it seems more likely that the source cited here is a baraita that closely resembles the Mishnah but is not identical to it. See R. Gershon Hanokh Leiner, Sidrei Taharot, Massekhet Kelim (1873; reprint ed. with additions, New York: 1961), 255a, s.v. kippah and especially ibid., s.v. 'al ha- sefer and 255b-256a, s.v. kippah. Cf. also Epstein, ibid., who notes another difference between the Mishnah and the source cited in BT (in part of the text not cited here). Interestingly, a very similar baraita that reads netanuhu le-, rather than 'al, is found in tKel BB 6.10 (ed. Zuckermandel p. 596); cf. Epstein, ibid. However, even according to the Talmud's reading (netanattu le-), interpreting the root ntn as "designate" rather than "place" is problematic; see below. 29. I intentionally translate this literally, to convey the problematic character of the original; see below. 30. So all witnesses here except MS Munich, which reads 'al ("on") instead of le- ("to"); this reading might have been influenced by mKel 28.5, which also reads 'al (see above, n. 28), or by stylis- tic considerations, as the expression ntn le- sounds awkward; see below. (The reading 'al is also found in MS Karlsruhe before correction, although this reading was subsequently changed to le-, as in the other witnesses.) 31. Lit. "who said," although this is not a verbatim citation of Abbaye's ruling (see 1 above). Here the Talmud presents the viewpoint attributed (apparently by the anonymous stratum) to Abbaye; see our comments on la-b below. For such use of the term (de-)amar in rabbinic literature, see Sacha Stern, "Attribution and Authorship in the Babylonian Talmud," JJS 45 (1994): 37-38; Yaakov (Jeffrey) Rubenstein, "R. Peloni Le-Ta'ameh," Sidra 10 (1994): 111, n. 1, and the literature cited there; Sham- ma Yehudah Friedman, Talmud 'Arukh, Pereq Ha-Sokher 'Et Ha-'Ummanin: Ha-Nosah (New York and Jerusalem: The Jewish Theological Seminary, 1997), p. 437, and the literature cited there; Leib Moscovitz, "Double Readings in the Yerushalmi," in The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Cul- ture, vol. 1, ed. Peter Schifer (Tiibingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1998), p. 106. 32. Precisely what type of collection is meant here is not fully clear. An explanatory baraita cit- ed later on in the Talmud (not translated here) states: "How so? If they collected [gavu] for dead peo- 234</page><page sequence="9">"Designation is Significant" is for [other dead people]; the surplus [of a collection] for a [partic- ular] dead person is for his heirs," [implying that designation is not significant; otherwise, the heirs should not be allowed to use the sur- plus]! ... 11. Come, hear: "If one's mother and father were throwing garments33 at [a grave], others should save the [garments," implying that designa- tion is not significant, for if it were, it would be forbidden to save the garments]!- 12. There [they are throwing the garments] out of their grief, [but this is not considered designation]. 13. If so, how [shall we] explain what was taught in connection with this: "Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: When is this so? When [the gar- ments] did not touch the bier. But if they touched the bier, they they are forbidden"! [If the clothing was thrown out of grief, it should make no difference whether it touched the bier or not.] ... 14. This [the status of designation] is [the subject of] a tannaitic dispute, as was taught: a. If one overlaid [phylacteries] ... with the leather of a clean ani- mal, they are acceptable, even if [the leather] had not been tanned for this purpose [li-shemah]. b. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: Even the leather of a clean an- imal is unfit unless it was tanned for this purpose. 15. Ravina said to Rava: Is there any place where a corpse lies and a shroud is woven [afterwards] for the corpse? He said to him, Yes, as with the corpses of Harpania.34 1: Rava's and Abbaye's rulings here are formulated casuistically;35 these rul- ings discuss weaving shrouds and not the legal status of designation. By contrast, the Talmud's explanations of these rulings, which are formulated in Aramaic and appear after repetition of the original casuistic rulings in (1)a, were apparently not formulated by amoraim, but by the anonymous stratum of the Talmud.36 Interest- ingly, the only other part of this sugya (15) in which amoraim participate directly ple in general ... ," suggesting that the Mishnah refers to the collection of money (the usual object of "collection" in tannaitic Hebrew), although this argument is not conclusive, as the object of "collec- tion" in at least one tannaitic passage is food; see t'Er 2.15 (ed. Lieberman, p. 97, according to MS Vi- enna; the strange reading of MSS Erfurt and London in this passage, gibbu, might reflect some sort of attempt to deal with this linguistic anomaly). See our comments on this section below. 33. Lit. "utensils" (kelim), although the context (see especially below, 15) suggests this term should be rendered "garments" (cf. Rashi). 34. This part of the sugya is followed by a dispute about whether Abbaye's or Rava's view is ac- cepted. However, we do not cite this part of the discussion here, as it does not seem to contribute any- thing to our understanding of the literary or conceptual character of our sugya. 35. Here and throughout this paper, I use the term casuistic to refer to case law. For this use of the term see Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, pp. 1-3. 36. Cf. Jacobs, The Talmudic Argument, pp. 122-123. (For the shift of language and the use of resumptive repetition as criteria for identifying post-amoraic material in BT, see Shamma Yehudah 235</page><page sequence="10">Leib Moscovitz in the discussion (as opposed to merely glossing tannaitic sources; however, such glosses might not have originated in the course of the present discussion)37 also deals with weaving shrouds, and not with the legal status of designation.38 Thus, almost this entire sugya is anonymous and probably postamoraic.39 Nevertheless, for the sake of brevity we shall generally refer to the principles that "designation is/is not significant" as Abbaye's and Rava's viewpoints, rather than as viewpoints attributed to these scholars by the Talmud. 2: The "source case" of eglah 'arufah proposed to support Abbaye's view- point is problematic in various ways, although none of these considerations, indi- vidually or collectively, demonstrates that this case is an invalid prooftext. (Recall that significant disparities between analogue and inferendum are not uncommon in analogies, Bible-based or other, in rabbinic literature.) First, the Talmud's as- sumption that a heifer is prohibited through designation-actually, through en- trance into an unsown wadi-is disputed.40 Thus, Rav rules elsewhere (bKar 24b) that such a heifer is prohibited only after its neck is broken, implying that desig- nation is not effective, although Rav Hamnuna disagrees (ibid.). Accordingly, this case can hardly prove that designation is significant, although Abbaye (or the anonymous authors who suggested this case as a source or prooftext for his view- point) presumably adopted Rav Hamnuna's viewpoint (or a similar notion). Indeed, it is noteworthy that no explicit literary source, tannaitic or amoraic, is adduced here to prove that a heifer is prohibited even before its neck is broken, although it is possible that some tannaitic sources indirectly support this view.41 Likewise, there is an important difference between the designation of a heifer and the types of designation discussed in the beginning of our passage and else- Friedman, "Pereq Ha-Ishah Rabbah Ba-Bavli," in Mehqarim U-Meqorot, vol. 1, ed. H. Z. Dimitrovsky [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary], pp. 301-303.) Interestingly, while amoraic discussions about various types of designation appear elsewhere in BT (see e.g. bBer 26b and parallels and bShab 50a), these passages do not explicitly mention the principle that "designation is significant." This prin- ciple is mentioned in three other BT sugyot (bBer 23b, bMeg 26b, and bMen 34b), although it is not explicitly attributed to amoraim in any of these passages. 37. For example, Ulla's comment on 13 (not cited here) might not be a response to the anony- mous objection in the previous stage of the discussion, but an attempt to account for the "logical" dif- ficulty which R. Shimon b. Gamaliel's distinction raises, namely, what difference does it make whether the garments touched the grave or not. 38. The attributed-and casuistic--sections of the sugya, (1) and (15), form a sort of inclusio, although this might be sheer coincidence, rather than the result of intentional literary device. 39. Following the general, though admittedly not universal, scholarly consensus about the chronological provenance of most of the anonymous material in BT. See Friedman, "Pereq Ha-Ishah Rabbah," pp. 283-300, and the literature cited there; the introductions to David Halivni, Meqorot U- Masorot, Shabbat (Jerusalem: The Jewish Theological Seminary, 1982), pp. 5-27, and idem, Meqorot U-Masorot, Bava Qamma (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1993), pp. 7-21; Sussmann, "Ve-Shuv," pp. 108-109, n. 204, and the literature cited there; and especially Friedman, Talmud cArukh, pp. 16-18, 22-23, and the references there. For a contrary view see Robert Brody, The Geonim ofBabylonia and the Shaping ofMedieval Jewish Culture (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), p. 6, n. 12. 40. This point was already noted by the medieval commentators; see e.g. Tosafot ad loc., s.v. mai ta ama. 41. See mQid 2.9 and especially mHul 5.3, and cf. the talmudic discussions of these mishnay- ot. For post-tannaitic support for this viewpoint, see n. 42. 236</page><page sequence="11">"Designation is Significant" where in this sugya. Abbaye and Rava discuss designation performed by manufac- turing a certain object (shrouds) for a particular purpose. Designation of a heifer, however, is performed by having an existing object, the animal, enter an unsown wadi.42 And although it might be argued that this distinction is insignificant, since it is clear that a heifer is forbidden without actual use, implying that designation is significant, it is noteworthy that mere purchase of a heifer for use as an ceglah Car- ufah does not seem to render it prohibited according to any of the extant sources.43 Thus, even if we assume that the law of ceglah earufah is based on or otherwise par- adigmatically reflects a general principle about the legal status of designation, rather than local (exegetical?)44 considerations, this case cannot prove that all sorts of designation are halakhically significant. At best, it suggests that certain types of designation are significant.45 Needless to say, adopting such a viewpoint would ef- fectively neutralize many and perhaps most of the objections raised in our sugya. 3: The source case adduced here to support Rava's viewpoint is also prob- lematic (although, once again, the difficulties do not warrant automatic dismissal of this case). Here as in the previous part of the sugya, no explicit literary source is adduced to support the Talmud's assumption that idols (or appurtenances of idol worship; see below) are not forbidden through designation. Indeed, examining pos- sible sources suggests that all of these sources are objectionable. One such source, a baraita found in the Tosefta and cited elsewhere in the Talmud,46 was suggested by Rashi:47 One who says "This house is for idolatry, this cup is for idolatry" has said noth- ing, for there is no consecration for idolatry [ein heqdesh la-'avodah zarah]. However, further scrutiny suggests that this passage does not necessarily im- ply that designation for idolatrous use is insignificant. Thus, various other tannaitic sources indicate that designation for idolatrous use is halakhically significant. For example, m'AZ 3.7: There are three [types of] houses: a house originally built for idolatry is pro- hibited ... There are three [types of] stones: a stone originally hewed [to serve as] a pedestal [bimos] is prohibited ... 42. See ySot 9.6, 24a and bQid 57a and parallels. 43. This is implied fairly clearly by all of the talmudic sources which state that the heifer's en- trance into the wadi prohibits it (see the previous note), and it is stated explicitly in bQid 57a. 44. See ySot 9.6, 24a, the only extant source that explains why a heifer is prohibited after en- tering the wadi. 45. The idea that only certain types of designation are effective-and, more specifically, that designation at too early a stage is ineffective-seems to be adopted later on in the sugya ("is there anyone who holds that spinning yarn for weaving [is forbidden]," not cited above); cf. R. Abraham Bornstein, She'elot U-Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, Orah Havyim (reprint ed., New York, 1954), ?493:15, pp. 124a-b. 46. See bIAZ 44b, and cf. t'AZ 5.10 (ed. Zuckermandel, p. 469) = tTem 5.3 (ed. Zuckerman- del, p. 555); here I translate the baraita from BT. 47. This source was already suggested in two passages in She'iltot de-Rav Ahai; see the refer- ences above, n. 26. 237</page><page sequence="12">Leib Moscovitz And similarly in t`AZ 6.2 (ed. Zuckermandel, p. 469): If one designates [meyahed] his house for idolatry, the entire [house] renders people unclean [implying that designation is effective]. Moreover, numerous tannaitic sources indicate that an animal designated for idol worship (muqseh) but not yet worshipped is prohibited in the same way as an animal which had actually been worshipped (ne'evad).48 Accordingly, it seems that the principle underlying the baraita cited by Rashi (assuming, of course, that this baraita does not contradict or disagree with the other sources)49 is not that desig- nation for idolatrous use is not significant, but that one particular kind of idola- trous designation is insignificant-designating an existing object for idolatrous use ("consecration for idolatry"). By contrast, other types of designation for idol- atrous use-for example, manufacturing objects for idolatrous use, which resem- bles weaving shrouds much more closely than the case discussed in the baraita adduced by Rashi-presumably would be considered significant and render such objects prohibited.50 And while it might be argued that this baraita proves that cer- tain types of idolatrous designation are not significant, adopting this approach would pose serious problems to what seems to be the thrust of the sugya as a whole, namely, that designation per se, no matter how and on what it is performed, is not significant according to Rava. An alternative source for the Talmud's assumption here that idolatrous des- ignation is ineffective might be found in m'AZ 4.4 (according to the Palestinian reading in this Mishnah), although further scrutiny reveals that this source, too, is problematic.51 The Mishnah states: The idol of a non-Jew is prohibited immediately, and that of a Jew [only] af- ter it was worshipped. 48. See e.g. mZev 8.1, mTem 6.1, and very frequently. While the Tosefta (tiAZ 5.9 [ed. Zuck- ermandel, p. 469]) states that an object is considered muqseh only if it is subjected to some sort of phys- ical action or change (mere verbal declaration does not suffice), actual idolatrous worship is not necessary to prohibit the animal. For further discussion of these rulings, many of which seem to reflect contemporary realia, see Saul Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theolog- ical Seminary of America, 1962), pp. 147-152. 49. Significantly, the Talmud explains later on (in part of the passage not translated here) that Abbaye would reject Rava's argument because "we derive [the law concerning] something customary from something customary, excluding idolatry, which is not customary," and not because Abbaye re- lies on alternative and conflicting prooftexts. 50. Note that the baraita cited by Rashi refers to verbal designation of an existing object, in contrast to the case discussed in the beginning of the sugya--manufacturing clothing to serve as shrouds. Cf. R. Jacob Ettlinger, cArukh La-Ner (Warsaw, 1873), 30b, s.v. be-hazmanah. 51. To the best of my knowledge, no commentator explicitly maintains that our sugya alludes to this source. Note, however, the interesting observations of R. Akiba Eiger, Teshuvot Rabbi Akiba Eiger (Warsaw, 1834), Mahadurah Qamma, #3, s.v. ve-nir'eh (3b). See also the interesting suggestion of R. Shlomo Ganzfried, Qeset Ha-Sofer, Lishkat Ha-Sofer (reprint ed., Benei Braq, 1961), 48c, note gimmel. 238</page><page sequence="13">"Designation is Significant" The parallel Toseftan passage (t'AZ 5.3 [ed. Zuckermandel, p. 468]) pre- serves a conflicting tradition: If a Jew made an idol, it is forbidden even though it was not worshipped ... If a non-Jew made an idol, it is permitted until it was worshipped. Without entering a detailed discussion of these passages, their text-tradi- tions, and parallels,52 one thing is clear: the legal status of an idol which was des- ignated but not yet worshipped depends upon who made the idol, a Jew or a non-Jew, and not just on whether the idol was merely designated or actually wor- shipped. 53 Indeed, all of the tannaitic sources seem to agree that under certain cir- cumstances, manufacture of an object for idolatrous use renders it prohibited. Thus, this source, too, can hardly prove that designation, even idolatrous designa- tion, is insignificant. A third possibility, which seems at least at first sight to be somewhat less problematic than the other two, is suggested by the next part of the sugya (4), ac- cording to which Rava's source case deals with appurtenances for idol worship rather than actual idols. According to this interpretation, the term 'avodah zarah in (3) should not be interpreted as "idol" (assuming, of course, that (3) and (4) are the handiwork of the same author or reflect the same approach),54 as suggested by the plain sense of this term,55 but as "idolatry," and hence, by extension, as refer- ring to appurtenances for idol worship. However, this suggestion is also problematic. First, its clear implication that 52. See David Rosenthal, "Mishnah 'Avodah Zarah: Mahadurah Biqqortit Be-seruf Mavo," Ph.D. thesis (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 175-178, and Christine Elizabeth Hayes, Between the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 35-42. 53. Some rabbinic passages base this distinction on biblical exegesis; see y'AZ 4.4, 43d and b'AZ 52a. The view that idols manufactured by gentiles are prohibited immediately, even before they were used, can also be accounted for on logical grounds: gentiles might be assumed to seriously respect the idols they manufacture, and hence such idols are prohibited immediately. By contrast, Jews might have been assumed to treat such objects as devoid of value or even with contempt until proven other- wise, viz., by actual worship. (A variation on this possibility-gentiles, unlike Jews, presumably wor- ship idols immediately after manufacturing them-is highly implausible for various reasons; see already the objection of R. Jose in y'AZ 4.4, 43d, and see further Ephraim E. Urbach, "Hilkhot 'Avo- dah Zarah Ve-Ha-Mesi'ut Ha-Archeologit Ve-Ha-Historit Ba-Me'ah Ha-Sheniyyah U-Va-Me'ah Ha- Shelishit," Eres Israel 5 [1958]: 193 and n. 39 = idem, Me-'Olamam Shel Hakhamim [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1988], pp. 137-138 and n. 39, and Gerald Blidstein, "Nullification of Idolatry in Rabbinic Law," PAAJR 41-42 [1973-1974]: 15-16 and n. 44.) However, it is difficult to find any logical ex- planation for the opposite view, according to which idols manufactured by Jews are prohibited imme- diately after they manufactured and before they are used. 54. It is no by means clear that this is the case, even though both parts of the sugya are anony- mous. For similar possibilities in connection with other BT sugyot, see Friedman, Talmud cArukh, p. 419, s.v. ba'al gemara sheni. See also our comments on (4) for evidence that the argument there was not accepted by the author(s) of other parts of our sugya. 55. See also Rabbenu Hananel ad loc.: "Rava ... drew a verbal analogy from avodah zarah: just as eavodah zarah is not prohibited through designation until it is worshipped ...," implying that "avodah zarah refers to the idol rather than to an appurtenance. However, this might be an expanded paraphrase of the Talmud rather than a verbatim citation; note that no such reading is found in any of the extant witnesses to the text. 239</page><page sequence="14">Leib Moscovitz only the designation of appurtenances is insignificant according to Rava's view- point, but not the designation of objects with intrinsic legal status, seems to be con- tradicted by other parts of the sugya.56 Moreover, although two anonymous passages in BT state that the designation of appurtenances for idol worship is not effective," this notion is contradicted by the plain sense of at least one tannaitic ruling.58 Thus, the stone mentioned in m`AZ 3.7 and claimed there to be prohibit- ed through designation (see above) is described as a bimos59-ostensibly, a pedestal for the idol, and hence an appurtenance rather than an object which is it- self worshipped!60 Likewise, it is clear from PT's discussion of this Mishnah (yCAZ 3.10, 43b) that such a stone is considered an appurtenance.61 To be sure, some sages in PT (the matter is disputed there)62 apparently maintain that designation of appurtenances for idol worship is ineffective, and hence these sages had to ex- plain away the relevant mishnaic rulings, although these explanations clearly do not reflect the plain sense of the relevant tannaitic sources. 4: As indicated above and noted by various commentators,63 the discussion here implies that, according to Rava's viewpoint, only the designation of appurte- nances is insignificant, and not the designation of objects with intrinsic legal sta- tus.64 Now, most of the designated objects discussed in our sugya are apparently 56. See our comments on (4). 57. See b'AZ 19b and 52b. This is also the overwhelming consensus of the medieval commen- tators, who, not surprisingly, adopt the approach espoused by all of the relevant BT passages; see the sources cited in Moshe Goldstein, ed., Hiddushei Ha-Ritba, 'Avodah Zarah (Jerusalem: Mossad Har- av Kook, 1978), cols. 220-221, n. 249. For a contrary view see R. Abraham ben David, Perush cAl Massekhet ?Avodah Zarah, ed. Abraham Sofer (New York, 1960), p. 114 (and cf. n. 47, ibid.). 58. The Mishnaic and Toseftan passages cited above about designation of houses (m'AZ 3.7 and parallels) also seem to imply that designation of appurtenances is effective, although these passages could be explained with difficulty as referring to houses which are themselves worshipped; see e.g. y'AZ 3.9, 43b and parallels. 59. So all direct witnesses to the Mishnah's text here (with trivial orthographic variants, which need not concern us here); see Rosenthal, "Mishnah 'Avodah Zarah" (text), p. 48. Some indirect wit- nesses apparently read la-'avod ("to worship")-see Meiri, Avodah Zarah, p. 169 and n. 11 there-al- though this reading seems secondary, and was presumably motivated by the desire to bring the Mishnah into conformance with BT's view that appurtenances for idol worship are only prohibited after they were used (see above, and cf. the next note). 60. The contrary interpretation of various medievals (see e.g. Tosafot on b'AZ 47b, s.v. bayit) is extremely forced. Note that this suggestion is not based on any sort of textual or philological evi- dence, but on the desire to bring the ruling of the Mishnah into conformance with the Talmud's afore- mentioned position about designation. 61. See e.g. Mar'eh Ha-Panim ad loc., s.v. ha-mattikh. 62. See the aforementioned PT sugya, and note the remarks of R. Eleazar cited in y'AZ 3.9, 43b, which seem to imply that a house is an "appurtenance" (a place for storing idols). 63. See e.g. the sources and discussion in Berur Halakhah, in Talmud BavlicIm Halakhah Beru- rah ... Massekhet Sanhedrin (Jerusalem: Makhon Halakhah Berurah U-Verur Halakhah, 1991), p. 147, ?2 (the list there is incomplete), and see further ibid., ?3. 64. Interestingly, PT does not seem to distinguish between the designation of appurtenances (e.g., an ark for a Torah scroll) and of objects with intrinsic sanctity (e.g., ministering vessels): these cases are discussed in proximity in yMeg and yNed, albeit without drawing inferences from one case to another. On the other hand, PT does draw inferences from the designation of an ark for a Torah scroll (appurtenances) to designation of an area for use as a synagogue (see the beginning of the aforemen- 240</page><page sequence="15">"Designation is Significant" appurtenances (shrouds for the dead, graves for burial, etc.), but the last case (14a- b) almost certainly refers to objects with intrinsic sanctity: leather or parchment for phylacteries.65 Thus, this last case seems to contradict the upshot of the sugya here.66 5: This prooftext, which deals with the purity laws, is particularly problem- atic. First, it is surprising that this source-the only one cited here that deals with the purity laws-was adduced instead of other, clearer and more explicit passages dealing with these laws.67 Thus, mKel 25.9, the locus classicus about this issue, states: All utensils descend [=become susceptible] to ritual impurity through thought, but they only ascend from [susceptibility to] ritual impurity through physical change. This Mishnah is much more explicit about the status of designation and utensil im- purity than the source cited in our sugya, and also draws an important distinction which is overlooked by our sugya: that designation through thought is effective for rendering utensils susceptible to impurity, although such designation is not effec- tive for rendering utensils insusceptible to impurity. Even more problematic is the assumption underlying the Talmud's objection (cf. also 6-7) that the case discussed here entails designation and not use. Pre- sumably, this interpretation was prompted by the odd phraseology of the barai- ta-netanattu le-, lit. "placed/gave for," and hence (presumably) "designated." However, this interpretation of the phrase seems untenable,68 as this usage of ntn tioned PT sugyot), and a synagogue was apparently deemed by at least some rabbis to possess intrin- sic sanctity, although this point requires further analysis. See generally Steven Fine, This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1997), and the summary of previous scholarship in Lee I. Levine, TheAncient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 185-188, 220- 221 (and see now the interesting observations of Seth Schwartz, Imperialism and Jewish Society, 200 B.C.E. to 650 C.E. [Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2001], pp. 236-237). 65. It is not fully clear whether the baraita refers to the phylactery parchments (parashiyyot), straps, or leather boxes (cf. Yad Ramah, s.v. ta shema amar, 47c). However, according to all of these possibilities the leather is presumably intrinsically sacred and not just an appurtenance (against Yad Ramah, ibid.; see further Berur Halakhah, p. 148). 66. Interestingly, some commentators maintain that Rava himself might not have distinguished between appurtenances and objects with intrinsic sanctity (or other types of intrinsic legal status). Thus, Nahmanides (above, n. 4) suggests that only where the biblical text uses the word sham, as in the cases discussed in 2-3, does Rava maintain that designation of objects with intrinsic halakhic status is ef- fective. See also R. Naftali Zvi Yehudah Berlin, Ha'ameq She'alah (reprint ed.; Jerusalem: Mossad Har- av Kook, 1967), Huqqat, ?133, nn. 7 (3:116a-b) and 9 (118b), and cf. ibid., Vayyaqhel, ?67, n. 28 (1:444b) and Shelah ? 126, n. 8 (3:52b), and the comments on Rashi of R. Shlomo Ganzfried, Qeset Ha-Sofer, 48c, note gimmel. 67. For designation and utensil impurity, see e.g. mKel 20.4 and 26.5-9. For other aspects of designation and the purity laws, see e.g. the tannaitic discussions of designation of a door for taking a corpse out of a room (m'Ahil 7.3, etc.), disqualification oflustral water (mPar 9.4), and rendering food- stuffs susceptible or insusceptible to impurity (mToh 8.6, etc.). 68. This difficulty might be resolved by assuming that a different line of argumentation, which 241</page><page sequence="16">Leib Moscovitz le- is linguistically awkward and all but unattested in tannaitic literature (ordinar- ily this expression means "give to," as suggested by a literal interpretation of this phrase).69 6: The Talmud's attempted resolution of the objection from the baraita in (5) is problematic for two reasons. First, according to the suggested emendation the baraita requires both designation and use, and thus seems to disagree with both Abbaye's and Rava's viewpoints! Second, the objection raised in the previ- ous part of the sugya could have been resolved by a much simpler, less radical, and almost self-evident emendation from le- to Cal, altering the presumed mean- ing of this text from "designated for" to "placed on." Why then did the Talmud suggest such an extreme and seemingly unnecessary reconstruction of the baraita in 5? 8: Part (b) of this statement, according to which Abbaye holds that use with- out prior designation has no effect, is problematic: why should we assume that Abbaye holds this? Abbaye's original ruling about shrouds proves only that desig- nation is effective, but not that designation is necessary to confer a particular legal status, and there is no need to adopt such a position to resolve difficulties occur- ring anywhere else in the sugya. 10: Precisely what sort of collection is meant here is not fully clear.70 If the Mishnah refers to money for funeral expenses (which seems to be the plain sense of our passage), then this source seems to contradict the Talmud's earlier assertion (not cited above) that "spinning yarn for weaving" is not forbidden, i.e., that designation at too preliminary a stage is insignificant according to all opinions.71 Moreover, the plain sense of the Mishnah (as reflected, inter alia, by the con- text in which this Mishnah appears; see mSheq 2.3-5) suggests that this ruling is not based on some sort of principle about the legal status of designation, but on ideas about how money allocated by a donor for charity or other expenses should be disbursed-in other words, about how the donor's intentions should be assessed and honored.72 This interpretation of our Mishnah is supported by the relationship was somehow corrupted in the process of transmission, originally appeared in the talmudic text: the Talmud might have adduced the baraita to prove that designation is insufficient, as only actual use of the veil (i.e., placing it on the scroll, following the reading of all witnesses to the text of mKel 28.5, ne- tano cal) purifies it. If this reconstruction is correct, however, we are left with a very severe and seem- ingly insoluble problem: how and why did our current version of the Talmud, which clearly interprets this baraita differently (as proven by the following discussion), originate? 69. See e.g. mMS 4.7, mYom 4.3, mBQ 8.1, and frequently. However, ntn le- in the passive voice (not used in our source) sometimes means "[be] designated/set apart"; see especially mShevi 6.10, and see further mShevi 8.2 and mMS 2.1, although even passive forms of ntn le- frequently mean "be giv- en to." 70. See n. 32. 71. See the medievals ad loc., some of whom attempt to distinguish between designation of money in this case and "spinning yarn for weaving" mentioned above. However, their proposed dis- tinctions are not very convincing. 72. Cf. Hiddushei Ha-Ran on bSan 48a, s.v. motar (although he suggests this interpretation only with regard to motar ha-metim, not motar ha-met), and R. Abraham Isaiah Karelitz, Hazon Ish, Tohorot (Benei Beraq, 1974), Ohalot 22:31, s.v. sanhedrin, pp. 94-95. 242</page><page sequence="17">"Designation is Significant" between the two clauses of this passage. The first clause states that leftover mon- ey designated for the dead must be used for other dead people, implying that des- ignation is significant73 (assuming, of course, that the issue underlying this ruling is the legal status of designation); otherwise, one would presumably be allowed to use the money as one wishes. By contrast, the second clause seems to imply that designation is not significant, for here the surplus may be used by the heirs. In light of this apparent contradiction (which our sugya totally disregards), it seems that the issue underlying our Mishnah is not the status of designation, but a different problem: how to honor the donor's wishes when his contribution (or part of it) turns out to be unnecessary. This part of the sugya presents yet another difficulty. A baraita74 in the next part of the sugya (not cited here) presents views that disagree with the view of the anonymous first tanna cited here, which ostensibly assumes (if interpreted in light of the sugya's assumption that the issue at stake here is whether designation is sig- nificant) that designation is significant! Accordingly, the question arises: why did the Talmud raise an objection from our Mishnah and dispose of it through an oqim- ta (again, not cited above), when there are ostensibly no grounds for objection in the first place-Rava's and Abbaye's viewpoints correspond to the views of the different tannaim in the baraita! Further, should it be argued that the sugya pre- ferred to explain each amoraic view according to all tannaitic precedents, as the Talmud does indeed suggest further on, this suggestion too is problematic. The Tal- mud ultimately (14) seems75 to explain that the dispute between Abbaye and Rava corresponds to an earlier tannaitic dispute, albeit one that accounts only with great difficulty for the post-tannaitic dispute about the status of designation.76 There- fore, if the Talmud was willing to assume that the debate between Rava and Ab- baye had tannaitic antecedents, why not find such antecedents in a more appropriate passage, mSheq 2.5?77 11: As noted in our comments on the PT parallels, throwing utensils or gar- ments at a grave does not seem to entail either designation or use; the issue here seems to be whether or what sort of proximity to a grave renders utensils prohib- ited. This interpretation seems to be supported by R. Simeon b. Gamaliel's com- ment in (13) about clothing touching the bier (although the legal basis of this comment is explained differently further on by our sugya): if the criterion for pro- hibiting such clothing is designation, it should make no difference whether the clothing touched the bier or not; in both cases the garments were designated! Like- wise, it is difficult to construe mere contact with the bier as use, suggesting, once 73. Cf. Hiddushei Ha-Ran, ibid., although his attempt to distinguish between the first and sec- ond clauses here is unconvincing. 74. While this source is quite similar to the continuation of the Mishnah cited here, it is not identical to the Mishnah (see Epstein, Mavo, pp. 832, 857, 952), although the exact identity of this source is not critical for purposes of the present discussion. 75. I phrase matters this way in light of Nahmanides' interpretation of this passage; see text at n. 82. 76. See our comments on (14a-b). 77. I am not claiming, of course, that the basis of the dispute in mSheq 2.5 is whether designa- tion is halakhically significant; my point is simply that the dispute in mSheq 2.5 accounts for the post- tannaitic dispute about designation much better than the debate in (14a-b). 243</page><page sequence="18">Leib Moscovitz again, that the issue underlying the tannaitic rulings here is the legal status of con- tact or proximity, and not designation versus use. 14: This is probably the most problematic part of the sugya, and indeed the medieval commentaries disagree about which tannaitic view supports which amoraic view. According to Rashi and others,78 the first tanna of our baraita main- tains that intention is not necessary when tanning leather for phylacteries (at least de facto) because designation is insignificant. According to this view, the inten- tion mentioned here (li-shemah) is a form of designation, and "designation is in- significant" here means that designation is unnecessary, in contrast to the meaning of this principle elsewhere in our sugya, that designation is ineffective. Rabbenu Tam79 and other medievals, however, maintain that R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, like Rava, holds that designation is insignificant. According to this in- terpretation, proper intention for tanning (li-shemah) and designation (hazmanah) are distinct concepts. Precisely how and why the insignificance of "designation" necessitates proper intention according to this view is not fully clear, although it has been suggested that both of the views in the baraita would agree with Rav His- da in 7 that both designation and use are necessary, and that the leather mentioned here was somehow designated for sacred use (but not through proper intention for tanning), even though no mention of such designation is made here.s80 Thus, the anonymous first tanna (14a) holds that designation is significant, and hence fur- ther intention is unnecessary, whereas Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel maintains that the initial unmentioned designation was ineffective, rendering subsequent inten- tion for tanning necessary. Of course, this interpretation is extremely problematic, for if designation is ineffective, it is extremely difficult to understand how inten- tion can substitute for it. Likewise, while Rav Hisda maintains that designation is ineffective on its own, he agrees that it is effective in conjunction with action; why then should designation cum action be different in our case?8' A third explanation of this part of the sugya is offered by Nahmanides.82 He suggests that both views in the baraita can be explained according to either the viewpoint that designation is significant or that it is insignificant. Thus, the Tal- mud's assertion in (14) that "this is the subject of a tannaitic dispute" does not mean 78. This interpretation was already adopted in a geonic responsum (apparently by Rav Hai Gaon, citing Rav Moshe Gaon); see Osar Ha-Ge'onim, Shabbat, ed. B. M. Lewin (Jerusalem, 1930), p. 77 (Responsa), ?250. (See also ibid., p. 75, although the reading of the text there is somewhat prob- lematic; see nn. 4 and 5 ad loc.) 79. Cited in Tosafot on bSan 48b, s.v. af 'al pi, and subsequently in other medieval commen- taries. This view seems to have been accepted by Rabbenu Hananel in his commentary ad loc., which states that Rava's view corresponds to Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel's, although Rabbenu Hananel does not explain explain how or why these views correspond. Significantly, the advocates of this interpre- tation did not base it on logical difficulties with Rashi's explanation (see below), but on the contradic- tion between Rava's viewpoint, which was assumed to be halakhically binding (see bQid 52a and parallels), and another talmudic sugya, which seems to rule in accordance with R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. 80. This interpretation of Rabbenu Tam's explanation is found in Yad Ramah ad loc. (47c), s.v. ta shema 'amar. 81. These difficulties were already noted by Yad Ramah, ibid. (although his attempt to resolve them is quite forced); cf. R. Abraham b. Azriel, cAruggat Ha-Bosem, 2:45. 82. Milhamot Hashem on bSuk 9a, 4b in the printed editions ofAlfasi. 244</page><page sequence="19">"Designation is Significant" that Rava follows one tanna and Abbaye the other, but that the objection to Ab- baye's view raised from a baraita in the previous part of the sugya (not cited here) can be solved by assuming that Abbaye accepts the view of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel in 14b, who presumably disagrees with the baraita cited in the previous part of the discussion. According to this interpretation, Abbaye would hold that R. Simeon b. Gamaliel requires proper intention when tanning leather for phylacter- ies because designation is significant. Thus, Nahmanides' interpretation of Ab- baye's position is essentially equivalent to Rashi's interpretation of the sugya.83 By contrast, Rava would maintain that our baraita proves nothing about the signifi- cance or insignificance of designation: even according to Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel, the need for proper intention when tanning leather reflects a different principle, namely, that intention is necessary when preparing ritual objects.84 How- ever, there is no connection between this principle and the issue of the legal status of designation as discussed elsewhere in our sugya, that is, that designation con- fers ritual status on an object which has not yet been used. Nahmanides' interpretation draws our attention to a critical and seemingly insoluble problem with this part of the sugya, a problem that, in the final analysis, arises according to all interpretations of our sugya. The issue in 14a-b is whether intention/designation is necessary, in contrast to the issue addressed in the rest of this sugya-whether designation is effective, that is, whether it confers the same status as use. Thus, both of the views in this baraita, and certainly R. Simeon b. Gamaliel's view (according to Nahmanides' interpretation of Abbaye), seem total- ly irrelevant to the original debate about whether designation is significant!85 (Sig- nificantly, another sugya that discusses our baraita, bMen 42b, explains this baraita in light of the notion that proper intention [li-shemah] is necessary, with- out even alluding to the question of whether designation is significant.)86 This dif- ficulty is compounded by the fact that of all the sources adduced in our passage, this baraita was chosen to conclude the argumentation in our sugya and thereby to resolve the question of whether designation is significant, even though this barai- ta is the only source in this entire passage which does not address the issue ana- lyzed in the rest of the sugya: is designation effective or not. IV The various difficulties in our sugya can be accounted for by a combination of conceptual and literary factors. The role of conceptual considerations is obvi- 83. Nahmanides himself suggests that even the first tanna in (14a) could agree that designation is significant. Thus, the first tanna might disagree with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel because this schol- ar holds that the necessary intention (li-shemah) can be supplied even after the leather is tanned. How- ever, the conceptual basis of the first tanna's ruling is of secondary importance for purposes of the present discussion, and hence we do not consider this issue at greater length here. 84. See also R. Abraham b. David, Katuv Sham (Jerusalem: Makhon Le-Heqer Kitvei Yad 'Al Shem Maran Ha-Hatam Sofer Zatzal, 1990), on bSuk 9a, pp. 76-77. 85. Cf.

Friedmann, She'elat David, s.v. od sham, p. 3b, commenting on the discrepancy between these passages, apparently holds that they disagree. 245</page><page sequence="20">Leib Moscovitz ous: here, as elsewhere in BT, legal principles are assumed to apply to varied legal rulings from different and seemingly unrelated legal domains, even if such rulings can be explained just as well, if not more convincingly on other grounds. The cre- ators of such sugyot, with their "grand unified theory" approach to conceptual- ization (whatever the reasons for adopting it may have been) thus preferred to lump as many cases as possible under a single heading, rather than distinguishing such cases from one another and explaining them on the basis of narrower, essentially localized considerations. Nevertheless, this proclivity for broad-based, wide-ranging conceptualiza- tion cannot account for all of the problematic aspects of the sugya, such as the problematic source about head-coverings in (5) and the equally problematic treat- ment of this case; the location and analysis of mSheq 2.5; and especially the barai- ta in (14)a-b. These aspects of the sugya are better accounted for by literary considerations. Two possible explanations of why the baraita in (5) was discussed may be considered. This baraita might have been chosen precisely because it was one of the most problematic, least explicit, and "out of the way" sources available. In other words, this source might have been adduced to display intellectual vir- tuosity for its own sake, a phenomenon frequently encountered in BT, as noted both by classical commentators and modern scholars, who termed this phe- nomenon "magnifying and aggrandizing the Torah" (le-hagdil torah u-le-ha'adi- rah).87 However, another factor might have played a role in the Talmud's decision to cite this source. The artificiality of both the objection from this baraita and the emendation proposed to solve it suggest that the objection might have been dic- tated by the answer rather than vice versa. Thus, the Talmud might have sought a tannaitic antecedent for Rav Hisda's ruling, which is ostensibly at odds with both Abbaye's and Rava's viewpoints"8 and unsupported by any other tannaitic ruling.89 Such an antecedent was found-or, perhaps more accurately, created-through 87. See generally David Rosenthal, "Pirqa De-Abbaye," Tarbis 47 (1977): p. 100 n. 13; Fried- man, "Pereq Ha-Ishah Rabbah," pp. 327-329; David Halivni, Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara (Cam- bridge, Mass., and London: Harvard University Press, 1986), pp. 87-89; Shamma Yehudah Friedman, Talmud 4Arukh, Pereq Ha-Sokher Et Ha-Ummanin: Ha-Perush (Jerusalem: The Jewish Theological Seminary, 1990), p. 2, nn. 4, 6; Sussmann, "Ve-Shuv," p. 99 n. 184; and the literature cited in all of these works. Note also the suggestive observations of Abraham Goldberg, "Hitpattehut Ha-Sugya Ba- Talmud Ha-Bavli U-Meqoroteha," Tarbis 32 (1963): 144. 88. A similar difficulty was noted by R. Meir Ha-Levi Abulafia, Yad Ramah on bSan 48a, s.v. u-mefareqinan (46d-47a in the standard editions of this work; cf. also ibid. 47a, s.v. ta shema qever). Even though the designation of idols (or idolatrous appurtenances) without use is ineffective accord- ing to Rava, idolatrous worship without designation is effective; on what basis, then, should a combi- nation of designation and use be required by Rav Hisda when dealing with other types of objects? (The solution to this question suggested by Abulafia himself is unconvincing.) 89. It has been suggested that tMeg 2.13 (ed. Lieberman, p. 351), line 41, might provide a tan- naitic antecedent for Rav Hisda's ruling; see Tosefta Ki-Fshutah ad loc., p. 1154. However, this inter- pretation of the Tosefta is uncertain (since the "use" mentioned there was presumably not intended to sanctify the wrapping). Moreover, BT seems to been unaware of this baraita, which is not cited in our sugya. 246</page><page sequence="21">"Designation is Significant" the contrived reconstruction of the baraita in (5). In other words, the bona fide tex- tual difficulties in this passage-the strange combination of ntn and le-, whether based on a different reading in the Mishnah, a baraita, or some sort of pseudo- baraita specially composed for the occasion (perhaps through authorial or redac- tional reworking of existing sources)90-provided a springboard for the exegetical pyrotechnics which eventually yielded (pseudo)tannaitic support for Rav Hisda's ruling.91 So construed, the Talmud's decision to cite this baraita and to analyze it as done here should not be taken as evidence of textual, exegetical, or legal in- competence, but, on the contrary, of legal and exegetical-actually, eisegetical- virtuosity.92 As for the discussion of surplus collection in 10 ff., while the decision to an- alyze mSheq 2.5 can be readily accounted for by conceptual considerations of the sort discussed earlier, such considerations cannot explain why the Talmud ulti- mately dismissed this source as irrelevant, preferring to conclude the dialectical core of the sugya with an even more problematic source. Once again, though, this might reflect the artificial literary character of our passage, and especially the au- thors'/editors' desire to display intellectual virtuosity:93 these scholars did not want to bring the discussion to a close too quickly! They were willing to dismiss mSheq 2.5 as irrelevant to resolution of the debate in (1), thereby artificially pro- longing the sugya and ultimately-and intentionally-resolving the dispute in (1)a-b94 by presenting what is probably the most conceptually problematic case in the entire sugya.95 We now consider the two remaining problematic cases, (11), throwing gar- ments at a grave; and (14a-b), intention when tanning leather for phylacteries. The issue addressed in (11) might have been treated here because it was considered a variation or extension of the issue addressed in the beginning of the sugya, name- 90. For the possible existence of such phenomena in BT, see Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, pp. 261-262, and Shamma Friedman, "Uncovering Literary Dependencies in the Talmudic Corpus," in The Synoptic Problem in Rabbinic Literature, ed. Shaye J. D. Cohen (Providence, RI: Brown Uni- versity Press, 2000): 43 and n. 34 and the literature cited there. 91. Why Rav Hisda's viewpoint had to be mentioned at this early stage of the discussion is not fully clear. Perhaps this is a literary technique-a kind of foreshadowing-whereby the Talmud sought to provide tannaitic support for Rav Hisda's ruling at the earliest possible opportunity, since Rav His- da's ruling seems to conflict with all the other views in our passage. 92. A slight variation on this explanation is also possible: the baraita here might not have been adduced to foreshadow Rav Hisda's view, but to display legal, literary, and exegetical virtuosity for its own sake. This might also account for the Talmud's use of a somewhat esoteric source from Seder Tohorot. 93. Alternatively, this source might have been included here under the influence of the Tosefta or a similar baraita (see n. 97); note that related, though admittedly not identical, material about the designation of certain types of money is found in tMeg 2.15 (ed. Lieberman, p. 352), in the same con- text as the Tosefta's discussion of ritual designation (see text at n. 17 and following). 94. Even if (14a-b) was not meant to provide tannaitic antecedents for both of the amoraic views in 1, but only to rebut the objection to Abbaye in the previous section, as suggested by Nah- manides, the fact remains that this could have been accomplished just as convincingly and probably more so by citing the view of Rabbi Nathan in mSheq 2.5. 95. See further the interesting observations of Jacobs, The Talmudic Argument, p. 132, on the order of the sources in our sugya. 247</page><page sequence="22">Leib Moscovitz ly, does an action that falls short of actual use take effect?"96 However, this expla- nation cannot account for the case in (14a-b), since the issue addressed there is whether designation is necessary and not whether designation is effective. Ac- cordingly, two other explanations of the Talmud's treatment of (1 4a-b) may be con- sidered, both of which reflect literary rather than conceptual concerns. This sugya might have evolved through redactional reformulation of a pericope similar to that preserved in yYom (or, perhaps, under the influence of the Tosefta discussed ear- lier or a similar baraita).97 As noted above, the PT sugya juxtaposes rulings deal- ing with the issues of whether designation is necessary and whether designation is effective, although it does not attempt to draw inferences from one issue to the oth- er, since these issues are conceptually distinct. BT's editors or authors might have been familiar with a sugya fairly similar to the extant PT parallels, which they transformed from a collection of essentially independent and unrelated cases98- or, perhaps more accurately, of thematically related but legally and conceptually distinct cases which address diverse issues-into a dialectical discussion, all of whose components function inferentially. This transformation of a collection of in- dividual rulings into a dialectical pericope presumably stems from the common BT predilection for "give and take," which, in turn, was ostensibly motivated by liter- ary rather than conceptual considerations.99 This assumed transformation radical- ly altered not only the literary character of the putative Palestinian source sugya, but also its conceptual character, as the cases discussed were now expected to in- stantiate a wide-ranging, common legal principle. However, this imposition of a dialectical literary framework on the earlier collocational and largely inference- free framework attested by the PT parallels came with a heavy price-forced reconceptualization of certain parts of the sugya, especially (14a-b). This suggestion, which assumes that PT (or, more likely, a similar, though non-extant, Palestinian sugya) served here as a source for the BT sugya,'00 might 96. For an alternative explanation of why this issue was addressed here, see text at n. 101 and following. 97. For the possibility that the Tosefta or a similar collection of baraitot might provide the im- plicit contextual background for BT sugyot, see pro tempore Leib Moscovitz, "'Od 'Al Ha-Baraitot," p. 4 n. 19, and Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, pp. 264-265 and p. 369 n. 65, and the references there. 98. Note that while the extant PT sugyot do contain some inferences, all of these inferences are drawn between similar cases. By contrast, no comparisons are drawn between cases that clearly reflect different views about the effectiveness of designation-presumably, because PT assumed that these rulings were issued casuistically, on the basis of localized considerations, and not on the basis of broad, general principles about the legal status of designation. Thus, the sugyot in yMeg and yNed indicate that designation of a courtyard for a synagogue and arks or wraps for Torah scrolls has no effect before these objects are used, although designation of stones for use as gravestones renders them prohibited immediately, while two possibilities are considered regarding the designation of ministering vessels. 99. Cf. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, p. 234 n. 23. 100. A comprehensive discussion of the nature and scope of BT's familiarity with PT, whether the extant version of PT or some other form of the work, lies beyond the purview of the present study. See pro tempore David Rosenthal, "'Lo Itparesh Lan Mai Ba'ei Hakha,' " Bar-Ilan 18-19 (1981): 159- 160 n. 48, and the literature cited there; Friedman, Talmud 'Arukh, pp. 9-16; Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, pp. 25-26 and the accompanying notes (pp. 310-312) and the literature cited there; David Rosenthal, "Masorot Eres-Yisre'eliyyot Ve-Darkan Le-Bavel," Cathedra 92 (1999): 7-48. 248</page><page sequence="23">"Designation is Significant" also account for other difficulties in the BT passage,101 most notably the inclusion of the discussion of throwing clothing at graves (11). As noted above, 02 inclusion of this case in PT (based on associative editorial considerations) is understandable, whereas the use of this case in BT, to determine whether or not designation is sig- nificant, is not. Alternatively, but less likely in my opinion,'03 the Talmud might have orig- inally cited a different baraita here, which was subsequently replaced by a similar but ultimately incorrect baraita-presumably, because copyists or other early trans- mitters'04 of the text unwittingly substituted the other baraita, with which they were more familiar, for the original baraita. (Such citations of incorrect baraitot are apparently attested in both Talmudim.)o05 Specifically, the Talmud might have cited a baraita dealing with the effectiveness of designation for profane use, rather than a baraita stating that proper intention (li-shemah) is necessary when tanning leather.'06 Indeed, such a baraita appears in la-b in the sugya in yYom:'07 "If leather was tanned for use as an amulet ... Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel prohibits [writing a mezuzah on it]." Thus, the Talmud might have interpreted this barai- ta as implying that designation for profane use is effective, since such desig- nation confers a special profane status on the object so designated, thereby disqualifying this object from sacred use in the future (perhaps because it was considered disrespectful to use what was originally a profane object for sacred purposes).1'8 101. For an excellent example of how BT reliance on an earlier Palestinian sugya generated serious difficulties in BT, see bSan 5b and the discussion of this pericope (with references to earlier lit- erature) in Rosenthal, "Lo Itparesh," pp. 158-160, and Menahem Kister, "Masorot Aggadah Ve- Gilguleihen," Tarbis 60 (1991): 220. 102. See the end of section II. 103. Although there is no positive evidence supporting this suggestion, I consider it and its pos- sible implications here, since it is the only other a priori possibility that can account for the difficulties in (14) (as noted earlier, the interpretations of the classical commentators here are untenable). 104. If this suggestion is correct, substitution of the incorrect baraita must have occurred at a fairly early stage of transmission, since the baraita in our texts is attested by all of the extant text-wit- nesses. 105. See most recently Leib Moscovitz, "Kulho Sevira Leho," Sefer Ha-Zikkaron Le-Tirzah Lif- schitz (forthcoming), nn. 38-41 and the literature cited there. 106. For a similar explanation see Friedmann, She'elat David, s.v. od sham, p. 3b. (To be sure, Friedmann did not claim that the wrong baraita appears in our text of BT; rather, he attempts to explain the baraita there the same way as the baraita cited below.) However, Friedmann's suggestion as cur- rently formulated is extremely difficult to accept, since his interpretation of the BT baraita does not fit the plain sense of this baraita. 107. See also tMeg 2.16 (text at n. 17ff.) and the beginning and end of yMeg and yNed, where the Talmud considers the possibility that certain objects originally designated for profane use cannot be consecrated later (although this possibility is ultimately rejected). Note also the baraita found in our texts of yYom 3.6, 40c, line 62 ("if one made a utensil for profane use, the Temple may not use it"), al- though this baraita (and the conflicting baraita cited ibid., lines 60-61) might have arisen through tex- tual corruption; see n. 10. 108. Cf. Louis Ginzberg, Ginzei Schechter, 2 (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1929), p. 531. Ginzberg stresses the difference between the PT baraita, which discusses disqualification of an object designated for profane use, and the BT baraita, which deals with the requirement of proper in- tention (li-shemah) when preparing certain types of religious objects. 249</page><page sequence="24">Leib Moscovitz As indicated, this explanation is conjectural. However, its implications, if correct, are far reaching, as it reflects a highly innovative perspective on designa- tion, conceptually speaking. There is no reason to assume that the effectiveness of designation for sacred use must depend upon the effectiveness of designation for profane use and vice versa, especially if the rationale for prohibiting the sacred use of objects initially designated for profane use is disrespect for sancta, as suggest- ed earlier. Indeed, the Tosefta distinguishes between these issues,109 maintaining that designation for profane use is effective, at least in certain cases,110 whereas designation for sacred use is not. Therefore, if this explanation is correct-and it must be stressed, again, that this explanation is strictly conjectural-the Talmud's decision to conclude the dialectical part of our sugya as it did might have stemmed from the desire to conclude the sugya in as conceptually innovative a fashion as possible.'I We may now consider the relationship between our sugya and its PT paral- lels.112 The BT and PT passages"13 discuss many similar cases (e.g., grave-prepa- ration, throwing garments at a grave, and proper intention when preparing various types of ritual objects), although the exact literary sources discussed in each sug- ya differ. Other cases discussed in BT, however, are unique to that work, viz., the source cases in 2-3 about eglah carufah and designation for idolatry, and the cases of impure veils and surplus collection for the dead.114 Significantly, all of these cases are conceptually remote from the case discussed in the beginning of the BT sugya-weaving shrouds. Thus, the cases unique to BT are apparently those cases 109. See text at n. 23. 110. A slightly different approach is taken by yMeg and yNed, which maintain that designation of an area for profane use does not disqualify this area for subsequent use as a synagogue. 111. In concluding this discussion of the difficulties in our sugya, two other difficulties should be briefly considered. The problematic "source cases" in 2-3, neither of which seems to provide nec- essary or even valid instantiation of general principles that designation is or is not significant, were ap- parently adduced because these were the only clear-cut biblical precedents indicating whether designation is significant, at least in certain cases. (Strictly speaking, these precedents are not biblical, as neither of the cases alluded to in 2-3 is explicitly discussed in the Bible. Nevertheless, I deem these cases biblical precedents because the relevant legal institutions, idolatry and eglah 'arufah, are dis- cussed in the Bible, enabling the Talmud to adduce a gezerah shavah from these cases.) A second difficulty is the inconsistent approaches that the sugya seems to adopt concerning the designation of intrinsically sacred items and the status of excessively preliminary designation (see our comments on (4) and (10)). These inconsistencies could be explained on source-critical grounds if we assume that the relevant parts of the sugya are the handiwork of different authors. (The fact that the en- tire sugya is anonymous does not prove that it is the work of a single author; cf. above, n. 54.) Howev- er, there is no need to adopt this suggestion, as the authors/redactors might have wanted to analyze every literary source on its own terms and from its own perspective, without taking exegetical or con- ceptual possibilities raised elsewhere in the sugya into consideration. 112. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only extended BT conceptual sugya with close parallels in PT. 113. Here I refer to all the PT parallels, not just the passage from yYom. 114. R. David Friedmann (She'elat David, s.v. cod sham, p. 3b; q.v.) attempts, rather uncon- vincingly, to explain why the case of the head-covering in (5) was not discussed in PT. Note that while PT contains gemara on Mishnah Sheqalim, in contrast to BT, the legal basis of mSheq 2.5 is not dis- cussed in that Talmud. 250</page><page sequence="25">"Designation is Significant" that entail forced and problematic extension of the principles about the signifi- cance of designation. Such cases might have been included because the authors and/or redactors wanted to include as much material from as wide a variety of le- gal domains as possible. In addition, they might have wanted to display their in- tellectual virtuosity by citing prooftexts that are particularly far-fetched, thereby "magnifying and aggrandizing the Torah." Alternatively, the authors/redactors might have wanted to analyze a fixed, formulaic number of sources.115 This sug- gestion might be supported by the fact that the selection of cases here is not ex- haustive" 16 (even though the cases and literary sources discussed in this passage do address a wide variety of legal domains): some ostensibly relevant tannaitic sources, including but not limited to the legal domains addressed in the various parts of the BT sugya,117 are not cited here. V We may now summarize. The tannaitic sources adduced in the BT sugya, like those discussed in its parallels in PT, deal with legally and factually diverse cases of designation. Neither the tannaitic sources nor PT's treatment of them seems to be based on broad general principles about the legal status of designa- tion; the issue at stake in all of these sources seems to be what types of designa- tion are legally significant, with the answer depending upon the particular case addressed' 18-in short, on localized considerations of limited scope.1 19 It is note- worthy, too, that while the theme of designation implicitly underlies most of the discussion in PT and the tannaitic sources, nowhere do these sources explicitly mention this notion,'20 although it might be argued that the absence of such a term reflects literary or linguistic considerations-the lack of appropriate terminolo- gy-rather than conceptual considerations. Matters change significantly in BT. This Talmud attempts to subsume all of 115. For such phenomena in BT, see Friedman, "Pereq Ha-Ishah Rabbah," pp. 316-319. How- ever, it is difficult to determine how the sources should be counted here, since it is not clear whether or not the source cases should be counted, whether different clauses of a single source should be count- ed separately, etc. 116. Note, though, that the collection of sources dealing with corpse designation (not cited here), the issue that most closely resembles that discussed in the beginning of the sugya, is fairly com- prehensive. 117. See our comments on the relevant parts of the sugya. For other potentially relevant tan- naitic sources, see e.g. mMa'as 4.2 and mBes 1.3, 4.7. 118. See further R. Meir Simhah Ha-Kohen of Dvinsk, Or Sameah (Riga, 1926), Hilkhot Tefill- in 4:9, s.v. hinneh talei. 119. In some of the cases discussed in these passages, the relevant laws are inferred in other passages through biblical exegesis, although it could be countered that such exegesis is based on or could at least serve as the basis for broader principles (cf. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, pp. 37-38). See the discussion of 'eglah 'arufah in ySot 9.6, 24a; the sources cited by Lieberman, Tosefta Ki- Fshutah, 5:1158 (on lines 53-54), which indicate that Temple appurtenances must be prepared in sanc- tity; and the biblical verses cited in bSuk 9a to prove that proper intention (li-shemah) is necessary in connection with certain religious precepts. 120. Indeed, terminology denoting abstract concepts is generally not found in PT; cf. Moscovitz, Talmudic Reasoning, p. 292 and n. 1. 251</page><page sequence="26">Leib Moscovitz the diverse cases considered under a single, common principle of exceptionally broad scope. This approach accords with BT's general proclivity for "grand uni- fied theories," even though the cases so explained often differ significantly from one another. In addition, our analysis of the BT sugya suggests that literary con- siderations account for certain features of this passage. The selection, arrange- ment, and treatment of certain cases in this sugya were apparently motivated by the desire to display intellectual virtuosity, to artificially fill out the sugya, and by dependence on an earlier Palestinian discussion of relevant laws. However, in con- trast to this putative Palestinian source and the extant PT parallels, the BT authors/ editors imposed an inferential framework on the collocational PT sugya, thereby creating a discussion replete with legal and conceptual difficulties, since this peri- cope compared rulings which, though superficially similar, are ultimately not comparable (and which were therefore not compared by the parallels in PT). Thus, the sugya should not be considered a comprehensive, hermeneutically and con- ceptually rigorous analysis of designation, since the character of this pericope was determined by literary artifice no less than by the adoption of a particular con- ceptual approach. Nevertheless, this combination of literary and conceptual fac- tors ultimately produced a literary and conceptual tour de force that reflects rabbinic conceptual thought and BT compositional and redactional techniques at their most sophisticated. It remains to be determined how many extended BT con- ceptual sugyot originated under similar circumstances; hopefully, this study will stimulate further investigation of this important issue. 252</page></plain_text>
