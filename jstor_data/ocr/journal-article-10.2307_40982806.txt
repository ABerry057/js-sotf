Becker Now is an appropriate time to reconsider the historiographical benefit that a comparative study of the East Syrian ("Nestorian") schools and the Babylonian rab- binic academies may offer.* This is attributable both to the recent, rapid increase in scholarship on Jewish-Christian relations in the Roman Empire and late antiquity more broadly,1 and to the return by some scholars of rabbinic Judaism to the issues of a scholarly exchange of the late 1970s and early 1980s about the nature of rab- binic academic institutionalization. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, scho- lars of classics, Greek and Roman history, and late antiquity have significantly added to the bibliography on the transmission of knowledge - in lay person's terms, education - in the Greco-Roman and early Christian worlds.2 Schools continue to be an intense topic of conversation, and my own recent work on the School of Nisibis and the East Syrian schools in general suggests that the trans- formations and innovations of late antiquity also occurred in the Sasanian Empire, at * This article is based on a paper given at the Annual Conference of the Association for Jewish Studies in 2005. 1 thank those who provided feedback at the time, as well as Jeffrey Rubenstein, Natalie Dohrmann, Ra'anan Boustan, and especially Michael Pregill and Bridget Purcell.

Becker a great distance from the centers of classical learning, such as Athens, Alexandria, and Antioch.3 The recently reexamined East Syrian sources may help push the con- versation about rabbinic academic institutionalization forward. However, the sig- nificance of this issue is not simply attributable to its bearing on the social and institutional history of rabbinic institutions. Such inquiry may also reflect on how we understand the Babylonian Talmud and on the difficult redaction history of its constituent parts. Furthermore, I hope that the discussion offered herein will contrib- ute to the ongoing analysis of the late antique creation and formalization of cultures of learning, which were transmitted, in turn, into the Eastern (i.e., Islamic and "Oriental" Christian and Jewish) and Western Middle Ages within their correspond- ing communities. The purpose of this article is to ask how we can better conceptualize the relationship between the respective histories of Jewish and Christian institutions of learning in late antique Mesopotamia, in order that they may shed light on each other. I will describe the East Syrian material and review the scholarship that employs the internal talmudic evidence to examine rabbinic institutionaliza- tion. I will also address some recent work on the Sasanian Persian cultural context of the Babylonian Talmud. My focus will be methodological, raising the question of how we should understand the relationship between these two cul- tures of learning, especially in light of recent scholarship on the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. I do not pretend to make a new contribution to the discussion of the rabbinic sources through actual source analysis. I come to this material as a Syriacist, not a talmudist, but I hope that an outsider's specu- lation on an issue in the field of rabbinics may help spur future work among scho- lars engaged with the social history of the Babylonian Talmud. The recent interest in Syriac among nonspecialists is noteworthy, and the increasing use of Syriac sources by scholars of Islam and rabbinics, and, of course, Patristics and the history of late antiquity, will no doubt have a salutary effect on Syriac studies, just as it will contribute new sources for consideration to these various other fields. The East Syrian schools From 1886 to 1897, the Russian Jewish scholar Daniel Chwolson published numerous late thirteenth- and fourteenth-century grave inscriptions found in modern-day Kyrgyzstan.4 More recently, these inscriptions have been employed to partially reconstruct the history of a community of "Nestorian" Christians 3.

Chwolson thought this term was used to refer to lawyers (cf. Gr. scholastikos);7 however, this rendering is wrong.8 To strike the right nuance in translating the word 'eskoldyd is difficult, but for lack of a better term, we might render it as "school student," or even "scho- lastic" or "schoolman," labels commonly used in English to refer to those associ- ated with the medieval Latin schools of Western Europe (cf. Lat. scholaris). Like other school titles found in these inscriptions, the term was commonly used from the late fifth century on to designate both the students of East Syrian "schools" and those associated with the "schools" as instructors.9 One of the numerous Greek words to creep into Syriac in late antiquity is the word schole, or in Syriac, 'eskole, the root of 'eskoldyd. 10 Initially, this word shows up most often in the various sources for the School of Nisibis, the most prominent of a number of East Syrian schools attested from the sixth century on.11 By "East Syrian," I mean Syriac-speaking "Nestorian" Christians and the ecclesiastical hier- archy they developed, particularly in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. 12 To be sure, these schools, despite sharing an obvious etymological link, have little in common with our own modern notion of the school. In fact, one part of my research has been to attempt to understand these "schools," as they were called, in which one learned to read and write (as we do in our own schools) as part of a larger 5.

The long e (e) ending is often marked in manuscripts by the seyame, which is the double dot placed above a Syriac word to mark it as plural, as such a long e (e) is common to masculine plural nouns. 1 1 .

Becker system of devotional practice aimed at forming elite Christian men - gender is not inconsequential here - who, in turn, would guide the Church of the East. This ped- agogical system led to a social group of "schoolmen," which became common enough in the church that it persisted, as the Kyrgyz gravestones attest, until much later in the Middle Ages. The East Syrian practice of devotional study, the elevation of the man of learning to an authoritative position within the community, and the development of correlative social institutions correspond to a similar phenomenon in rabbinic ciilture, the effects of which are still easily apparent in Judaism today. This cultural development occurred among the East Syrians at the same time and place - the late antique and early Islamic period in Mesopotamia - as the formation of the rab- binic yeshivot (and, of course, the cultural processes that contributed to this devel- opment persisted in early Islamic times among Muslims, despite the rather late emergence of the madrasa). The Syriac sources attest to the spread of East Syrian schools throughout Mesopotamia beginning in the sixth century CE. We can roughly divide these East Syrian schools into three categories: independent schools, institutions that were not based in, or wholly dependent on, a local church or monastery and that provided both elementary literacy and higher learn- ing; monastic schools, that is, centers of learning based within monasteries; and village schools, which can be divided into those that taught elementary lessons in reading and church service and those in which a higher form of learning could also be acquired.13 The two most developed and well-attested schools in the sixth century were independent schools: the School of Seleucia, in the agglomeration of towns com- monly referred to as Mehoza in rabbinic sources, and the School of Nisibis. The former would not have been far from contemporary rabbinic institutions. It was founded in the Sasanian capital in the mid-sixth century, possibly by the Catholi- cos Mar Aba I (d. 552), who had studied at the School of Nisibis.14 The latter was founded after the so-called School of the Persians in Edessa (modern Urfa in Turkey) was closed in 489 by the bishop of the city, Cyrus, under orders from Emperor Zeno (d. 49 1).15 Numerous leading figures in the Church of the East in the sixth and seventh centuries passed through this school, and it seems also to have played a significant role in the importation of Western texts and ideas into the Sasanian Empire. Furthermore, before the School of Nisibis's fame spread, and for some time running parallel to the rise of such formally structured East Syrian schools, Christians also studied with individual teachers. However, 13. Becker, Fear of God, 155-68. 14. J.-M.

The sources are thin, and there is no chronological overlap. However, because Nisibis shows up in rabbinic sources, some have tried to draw connections to the Christian school there. Rabbi Yehudah ben Bathyra, a first-century rabbi (Tanna), is said to have been an agent in charge of the trans- fer of Temple funds from Jews in the region of Nisibis to Jerusalem. See, e.g., Jacob Neusner, History of the Jews in Babylonia (Leiden: Brill, 1965-), 1:43-48. 94</page><page sequence="5">The Comparative Study of "Scholasticism" one of the most significant developments within the school movement was that, as I have stated elsewhere, schools were no longer centered around charismatic tea- chers, but became actual places of learning.16 In the same way, the Babylonian rabbinic yeshivot were transformed from study circles centered around learned masters to formal institutions that remained intact after the death of individual masters. The rabbinic academies David Goodblatt puts forward such a model of institutionalization for the rabbinic academies - from study circle to school - in Rabbinic Instruction in Sasanian Babylonia, in which he suggests that rabbinic academies did not exist in Babylonia in amoraic times, but rather only came into being later.17 Goodblatt argues that yeshivah and its Babylonian Jewish Aramaic equivalent, metivta, do not mean "school" or "yeshivah" in the Babylonian sources. Rather, the word tends to be used to refer to a "learning session" or a "session of study," and not to the place where study occurs, which is commonly rendered by the words be rav, "at the house of or "with the master." Though it is not mentioned by Good- blatt, his argument is aided by the regular use of the Syriac mawtbha, the equiv- alent of metivta, for just this: a period of study.18 Goodblatt is responding to the standard scholarly position, derived from an uncritical reading of later geonic sources, that the academies of the Islamic period existed as essentially the same institutions in the Sasanian period, even as early as the third century CE, when Rav and Samuel supposedly founded their academies in Nehardea and Pumbedita, respectively. While formal academies did not exist, Goodblatt suggests that the disciple circles and other informal congeries organized around learning did develop. For example, he argues that a specific group with certain halakhic inter- ests can be identified in Nehardea in the early fourth century.19 In more recent scholarship on Palestine, scholars have examined similar social practices and institutions, eschewing formal "schools" for social networks and local traditions.20 As is well known, Goodblatt and Yeshayahu Gafhi engaged in a back-and-forth debate over the issue of academic institutionalization 16.

Becker in the pages of Zion and Tarbiz (1978-82). Gafiii argues, pace Goodblatt, that the words yeshivah and metivta are, in fact, used in the Babylonian Talmud at times to refer to formal institutions of learning.21 Gafhi continued to address the topic, engaging with Goodblatt's criticisms but coming to conclusions less radical vis-a-vis the historiographical tradition, and included the issue in his later syn- thetic work of 1990.22 Furthermore, this question of institutionalization has been closely tied to that of the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud: scholars often work with the assump- tion that the two correspond in some way.23 While the common assumption has been that the Talmud was produced in some form of yeshivah setting, Daphna Ephrat and Yaakov Elman argue that the institution may have come about after the formation of this literature, perhaps even because of it.24 Goodblatt has recently produced a summary of the issue, going back to what he argues was the origin of this problem in the geonic sources themselves.25 One factor that has become the center of this conversation in recent scholar- ship is the role of the stammaim, those rabbis who redacted amoraic traditions within the stratum we call the stam ha-talmud, that is, the unattributed or anon- ymous material that makes up the majority of the Babylonian Talmud. The stam as a distinct stratum, with its own interests, arguments, and tendencies, has received scholarly attention since the 1970s. However, until recently, the halakhic (legal) argumentation of the stam was the focus of study, not its aggadic (narrative) or cultural tendencies.26 The most recent piece that Goodblatt cites in his review is an article written in 2001 by Jeffrey Rubenstein, who tries to resolve the difference between Goodblatt and Gafhi by laying evidence within the framework provided by scholars such as David Weiss Halivni and Shamma Friedman on the stammaitic stratum of the Talmud.27 Rubenstein argues that those places where Gafhi finds 2 1 .

In this regard, there is a correlation between textual, pedagogical, and institutional developments. The silencing of the Amoraim, the macro-formation of the Babylonian Talmud, the institutionalization of the trans- mission of knowledge, and the development of schools had all begun by the end of the fifth century (or perhaps the mid-sixth century).28 Rubenstein summar- izes the issue: Indeed, the development of rabbinic academies may have been a critical factor in the shift from amoraic to stammaitic times, that is, in the decision no longer to preserve attributions, as the introduction of new forms of social organiz- ation often entails significant cultural shifts. Fully integrating the theory of the stammaitic redaction - or rather, creation - of the Babylonian Talmud into the historiography hence promises to subvert and transform what we know about ancient and early medieval Judaism.30 Further- more, because we find the absence of attributions as well as the creation of false ones in later Palestinian sources, we might ask the following in general: what is the relationship between anonymity and institutionalization?31 Comparison to the East Syrian sources may shed light on these issues. Furthermore, such a comparison need not be limited to fully developed inde- pendent institutions, whenever they finally did come into being. The elementary levels of study practiced at all three types of East Syrian schools, especially the village school, are not unlike the kind of study we might imagine at a belt midrash, the center of elementary Jewish learning, whereas some of the insti- tutions that the East Syrian sources describe as "schools" seem to be informal circles around learned men, comparable to the rabbinic study circle. Moreover, as I will address later, the two religious cultures are comparable on multiple levels with regard not only to their practice of learning, but also to their conception of it. The question of Jewish-Christian relations Before continuing, I need to make explicit the larger framework within which I understand the relationship between these two school cultures, and between Judaism and Christianity in general, in late antique Mesopotamia. Recent scholarship has increasingly questioned the assumption that Judaism and Christianity were shaped by a definitive "parting of the ways," after which 28. Cf. David Halivni, "Aspects of the Formation of the Talmud," in Creation and Composition, 346. 29. Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, "Social and Institutional Settings of Rabbinic Literature," in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, ed. Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert and Martin S.

See the comments by Adiel Schremer, "Stammaitic Historiography," in Creation and Com- position, 219-35. 31.1 thank the anonymous reviewer for pushing me on this question and regret that I am unable to address it in any detail. The various Christian catena traditions are directly related to this issue. 97</page><page sequence="8">Adam H. Becker these two religions followed wholly separate trajectories.32 According to this tra- ditional model, Judaism and Christianity institutionalized their differences after the Bar Kokhba revolt (135 CE) and became distinct and autonomous religions. From that point on, the two "religions" existed as relatively isolated entities and developed separately, only interacting through polemical conflict and mutual mis- perception, with the exception of limited instances of unidirectional influence of one religion on the other.33 In challenging this "parting of the ways" model with regard to a comparative history of institutions of learning, I do not claim that there were no Jews and no Christians and that there was only a hodge-podge of in-between groups. Such hybrid groups did exist, and they continue to defy our (and ancient religious elites') categories, but there were also thoroughly non- Jewish Christians and thoroughly non-Christian Jews. I am not interested in non-"Orthodox" Jews and Christians who blur the boundaries. Rather, in looking at the schools and academies, we are examining learned elites, those who enjoyed some dominance in their communities and who saw themselves and were able eventually to get others to see themselves as representative of the norms of the Jewish and Christian communities, respectively. The problem I wish to address is how we can transcend reliance on the notion of simple "influence," on the one hand, where one autonomous and distinct entity affects another, and a vague idea such as Zeitgeist or "Spirit of the Age," on the other, as tools for explaining the similarities that existed between the two social groups. A similar issue is raised in Peter Schafer's Mirror of His Beauty (2002), in which he suggests that the strong focus on the shekhinah as a feminine being and the meaningfulness of this gender attribution in Jewish mysticism may be under- stood within the context of the high Mariology of southern France in the twelfth century.34 Schafer rejects the kind of diachronic history found in, for example, the classic work on mysticism of Gershom Scholem, for a synchronic analysis that examines religious communities as ultimately porous. The relationship between East Syrian schools and rabbinic academies raises the same question. Regarding the schools, we might ask, how do we understand religious diversity and inter- action and the shared religious discourses that existed among different religious communities living side by side in the same empire? How do we do this without relying on the problematic notion of "influence" or the equally proble- matic notion of "Zeitgeist"? To put the two points on the spectrum in stark con- trast, I would say that, on the one hand, I do not think it is a coincidence that the Jewish and Christian communities had parallel institutions of learning. Jews and Christians in Mesopotamia spoke essentially the same language,35 were 32. See note 1 herein. 33.

Syriac is a literary dialect deriving originally from Edessa in Osrhoene in northwestern Mesopotamia. Christians farther east in Mesopotamia spoke a dialect closer to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. For later Christian dialects and their relation to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, see Samuel 98</page><page sequence="9">The Comparative Study of "Scholasticism" subjects of the same state, and shared a common imaginary world, which included notions of magic, mysticism, eschatology, revelation, and the need for inquiry into the meaning of that revelation. Furthermore, as Christine Hayes suggests, there was probably greater economic interaction between rabbinic Jews and non-Jews in Babylonia than in Palestine.36 On the other hand, I doubt we should imagine in our historiographical recon- struction that, for example, a Jew walked by a Christian school one day and said to himself, "I have a great idea. Let's build schools instead of having these study circles of ours." We are addressing a historiographical problem of multicausality. Because we can trace the independent development of Jewish and Christian forms of learning in Mesopotamia, such an inquiry entails a synchronic analysis of dia- chronically distinct entities. But if each entity has its own separate trajectory, do we then assume that these trajectories have no relation to one another? Can each trajectory not be drawn in certain directions by the other, perhaps like a cathode ray drawn by a magnet? Points of interaction of both religious and non- religious nature between these communities may have existed, but we need to reconceptualize our model of understanding this interaction, if "interaction" is even the right term. I might add that with regard to the question at hand, such study will unfortunately continue for the foreseeable future only with texts, as the kind of archeological work that needs to be done has been delayed by the bloody political situation in Iraq.37 The kind of analysis produced by Steven Wasserstrom in his Between Muslim and Jew (1995) goes one step beyond this dichotomy of Zeitgeist and "influence."38 In this study, "symbiosis," a metaphor taken from the biological sciences, allows us to imagine two distinct entities mutually interacting over time, responding to each other, critiquing, and sharing. However, Wasserstrom's book addresses the early Islamic period, a time when such interactions between Muslims and Jews are well attested. It is much easier to demonstrate intercommu- nal interaction within the new oikoumene created by the Arab conquest. For example, Sidney Griffith's recent book addresses the world of Kalam, Islamic speculative philosophy and theology, shared by Muslims, Christians, and Jews.39 In contrast, the study of religious communities in the Sasanian Empire E.

Becker and of the interrelationship between them is far less developed, in part because of the obscurity of the evidence compared to that for the later Middle Ages both in Latin Christendom and in the Muslim Middle East.40 Parallels and fundamental differences One type of comparative, intercultural research that has begun is the study of the relationship between rabbinic and Middle Persian-Zoroastrian culture, most notably in numerous articles published in Irano-Judaica (Jerusalem, 1982-), the work of Shaul Shaked, and, more recently, several pieces by Yaakov Elman in which acculturation, accommodation, and resistance in the rabbinic relationship to Persian culture are examined.41 A recent contribution to this journal by Shai Secunda synthesizes such a historical contextual approach with a focus on internal talmudic hermeneutics.42 An article by Geoffrey Herman lays out some of the issues for Irano-talmudic inquiry;43 he examines "Jewish-Zoroastrian syncretistic tendencies" in rabbinic literature:44 [T]he insular quality of this religious literature would naturally tend to avoid explicit references. It would, indeed, not be surprising to find various religious and other influences or borrowings dressed up, reformulated, or otherwise judaized. Herman characterizes Elman's work as "the identification of legal processes and principles, common to both Sasanian and Talmudic corpora."46 In this article, Herman then examines two instances of the assimilation of Persian elements 40.

He looks at the account of how King Ahasuerus served as a stable master for his predecessor Belshazzar and how this tale employs the Middle Persian Kdrndmag (Book of the Deeds) of Ardashir, son of Babag, and examines the Middle Persian influence on the figure of Alexander the Great in the Talmud. Notably, these are both places where parallel dependencies exist for Christian sources: in his book on the legend of Mar Qardagh, Joel Walker shows the Syriac Christian dependence on sources such as the Kdmdmag,47 while numerous Syriac Christian sources on Alexander still require further study.48 Even more apt to the topic of schools, some time ago, Daniel Sperber provided a close reading of b. Bava Qama 117a-b, demonstrating the Persian context for the famous story of Rav Kahana's flight from Babylonia to R. Yohanan's yeshivah in Palestine, where Rav Kahana soon dies, but is then raised from the dead to engage in further discussion.49 The East Syrian sources are verbally, thematically, and historically compar- able to the rabbinic ones in a variety of ways. Even without systematic study, a number of parallels are immediately apparent.50 For example, some rabbinic aca- demic terms have Syriac equivalents {rav, metivta,51 siyyuma,52 qam b-resh53). Even if Gafhi is inaccurate in suggesting that the Greek kella (the source of the Syriac kellayta or "monastic cell") is also the source for the rabbinic kalla (the term used for the period of several days when scholars convened to study a specific tractate- a practice formalized in the geonic period),54 we perhaps are able nevertheless to find a parallel between the semester system of the respective academies. Indeed, the School of Nisibis had a summer and a winter semester, as 47.

Becker did later rabbinic academies.55 The pair of scholars, or zug (from Gr., zugos), has its Syriac equivalent in the use of the same word for the relationship between East Syrian holy men and saints.56 Chains of transmission, ultimately deriving from classical sources, are common to both cultures.57 The shekhinah commonly appears in East Syrian speculation about the divine presence as a distinct entity (Syr. shekhinta). The rabbinic pirka, or public lecture, may find its equivalent in the performance of the East Syrian 'elltha, an extant etiological genre of public address apparently also presented to a wide audience.59 The rabbinic "service of the heart" has its equivalent, "prayer of the heart," in Ephrem the Syrian's fourth-century writings, and became common in East Syrian spiritual lit- erature.60 Both cultures discerned angelic opposition to humans' special status within creation, though this status was attributable to Israel's reception of the Torah for one, and the human being's identity as the image of God for the other.61 We could expand from terminological and thematic parallels to consider broader social structures. For example, a comparison of the exilarchate and the East Syrian office of Catholicos has only recently been taken seriously.62 However, my interest is in another issue, one that is more difficult to address because of its nebulous character.

In contrast to the rabbinic academies, there was no legal dimension to East Syrian study. The East Syrian schools taught basic literacy as well as the East Syrian exegetical tradition, which derived heavily from Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 428), the Greek church father held as authoritative in the Church of the East. Moreover, from the literature produced by "schoolmen," we can observe an acquaintance with Greek Patristic literature translated into Syriac, as well as translations of Greek philosophical texts, particularly Aristotle's logical works and a portion of the neoplatonic commentary tradition on them. The East Syrians studied their own liturgical tradition and developed an etiological genre, the "cause" ('elltha), which examined important events on the sacred calendar. Apart from church canons, the East Syrians composed almost no legal texts and did not seem to have been interested in law, nor is there evidence that they were well acquainted with contemporary Jewish law.64 Similarly, as we know, the rabbis did not produce texts in any of the multiple genres in which the East Syrians composed, nor is there significant evidence that they were aware of East Syrian learned literature, such as East Syrian monastic and theological literature or texts employing Greek philosophical logic. Furthermore, scholars have emphasized the "pervasive orality," as Yaakov Elman expresses it, of amoraic and even post-amoraic culture.6 Elman even argues for the oral composition of the Babylonian Talmud in the sixth century. This is in stark contrast to the East Syrians, who had caught the Christian writing bug, a symptom of which is a predilection for textuality. The similarities between these two school cultures are reflected not in what was studied, but rather in the very idea of study and its multiple effects on, for example, social organization, ethics, and the idea of the self. 63. See, e.g., comments in J. Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Chris- tianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity (London: University of London, 1990), 1 14. By "paralle- lomania," I refer to the term made famous by Samuel Sandmel in "Parallelomania," Journal of Biblical Literature 81 (1962): 1-13. 64. However, the East Syrians did have a rather positive notion of "divine law." See, e.g., com- ments in Adam H.

Becker The scholastic habit as structuring principle Considering these fundamental differences in content, how were these cul- tures of learning similar, even once the rabbis had formal academies, whenever that was? The two communities were strikingly similar in structure. By "struc- ture," I mean syntactical relations, both objective and imagined, within which the scholastic social type of each community fit. This structure was pedagogical: both communities were guided by a pedagogical paradigm, or what I have referred to elsewhere as the "pedagogical model."67 In a volume dedicated to the question of the benefit of "scholasticism" as a cross-cultural category of analysis, Jose Cabezon lays out what he sees as the characteristics of scholasticism, including hermeneutics, epistemological accessibility, and systematicity.68 In the same volume, Michael D. Swartz demonstrates the applicability of the label scholastic to rabbinic Judaism.69 Elsewhere, I have argued that several of these character- istics, as well as the embodied, imaginative, and historiographical aspects of the "scholar" and the scholastic life - also emphasized by Swartz - may be applied to the East Syrians.70 With regard to a comparative scholasticism, Martin Jaffee's characterization of rabbinic pedagogical culture can be applied, without any changes, to the culture of learning found in the Church of the East: The disciple-community is a setting for the transmission of transformative knowledge in which emulation of the imparter of knowledge is both a primary goal of knowledge and proof of its possession. Although the existence of such "disciple-communities" was not uncommon in the early church, the East Syrians maintained the most quantitatively and qualitatively to the issues addressed here, see especially Edward Watts, "The Student Self in Late Antiquity," 234-52. 67.

For example, in the third volume of his History of the Jews of Babylonia, Jacob Neusner presents a formal comparison of the supposed amoraic yeshivot to "Nestorian" schools and monasteries.73 Neusner's comparison is apt because, apart from addressing details such as a common use of military terminology, he also focuses on structural similarities between the two. Neusner provides a composite, structural perspective on the rabbinic academies: What is most striking about the schools is the conception that in them lived holy men, who more accurately than anyone else conformed to the image of God conveyed by divine revelation through the Torah of Moses "our rabbi."74 Remove the emphasis on Torah - obviously, for the rabbis, the defining character- istic of the religious life - and again we have a statement that could be made about the East Syrians. The emphasis on the school as a factory for the holy, a place where the raw human being was worked to bring out his essential nature provided by the creator, can be found in both these cultures of learning. One fundamental problem that arises when we return to Neusner's discus- sion forty years later is that although his comparison is correct, he applies it to the wrong period. Neusner's work derives from a time before the critical turn that began with Goodblatt's work, and he addresses supposed academies in the .amoraic period under Shapur I (241-72) and Shapur II (309-79). Furthermore, he relies on the outdated work of Arthur Voobus for details about East Syrian monasticism and the history of the East Syrian schools.75 In fact, both Voobus 's work and Neusner's (I am not singling out Neusner here) suffer from the same flaw: they employ sources that project much later institutions onto an earlier period.76 Other scholars, such as Isaiah Gafhi, have further raised the issue of com- parison to the Syriac material and improved on Neusner's work, but unfortunately this further work has depended on what is now obsolete secondary literature.77 72.

In a brief piece published after his exchange with Goodblatt, Garni provides a comparison between the School ofNisibis and the rabbinic academies. The purpose of this article is, in part, to use the high level of institutionalization of the school as a comparandum to confirm the possibility of the development of academies in the amoraic period. The parallels and similarities he notes are significant, 105</page><page sequence="16">Adam H. Becker Recent developments in both rabbinics and the study of the Church of the East have created the possibility of new approaches. For example, in his The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud (2003), Jeffrey Rubenstein, whose recent work on the stam was mentioned earlier, briefly addresses the origins and structure of the School of Nisibis as demonstrating how the fifth- or sixth-century origins of the rabbinic academies "coheres with the broader cultural climate."78 After describing the main contours of the life of learning at the School of Nisibis and several "structural parallels" between it and that of the rabbinic academies, Ruben- stein states, This kind of scholastic lifestyle and piety describes that of the rabbis in general and in particular the Stammaim, who dedicated themselves to the systematization, interpretation, and analysis of earlier traditions. In contrast to Neusner and Gafhi, who compare the East Syrian "schoolmen" to the Amoraim, Rubenstein suggests that they are closer to the stammaim, both institu- tionally and in intellectual method. Furthermore, the East Syrian engagement with Greek texts and ideas serves for Daniel Boyarin as evidence confirming the "Hellenism" of the Babylonian rabbis.80 Boyarin rejects a simplistic model of "influence" for one of "shared and overlapping cultures imbricated on each other and partly simply just the same culture in different variants."81 In the Babylonian Talmud, we find "dialectic without telos";S2 furthermore, "the act of study was made an end in itself."83 These developments were simultaneous with a growing apophasis (negative theology) among the East Syrians as well as with a similar shift toward study as devotion. These parallels serve to demonstrate rabbinic Hellenism, especially because the and some of them deserve further study. Garni addresses the possible contact points between the Jewish and the Christian communities, but he is careful to qualify his argument: the similarities may just be structural and do not necessarily point to actual contacts between the two communities (Gafhi, "Hib- burim nestoryani'im k-maqor 1-toledot yeshivot bavel"). 78. Rubenstein, The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud, 35. 79. Ibid., 37. 80. "The Church of the East (and other Syriac-speaking Christians) provide then a pendant on which to hang - by analogy - the plausibility of claims for Hellenism in Jewish Babylonia as much, or more, than a vehicle for transmission. The extent to which the post-amoraic rabbinic community in Babylonia seems to have been open to the scholasticism of the Nisibene foundation renders the notion of a hermetically sealed, exclusively inner-directed community less and less convincing" (Daniel Boyarin, "Hellenism in Jewish Babylonia," in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, 350). However, this seems to be an intellectualist notion of Hellenism, in con- trast to what we find, e.g., in Glen W. Bowersock, Hellenism in Late Antiquity (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1990). 81. Ibid., 349. 82. Ibid., 347. 83. Ibid., 349. 106</page><page sequence="17">The Comparative Study of "Scholasticism" East Syrians relied heavily on Greek monastic and philosophical thought to move such developments forward.84 Future work needs to build on the suggestions of Neusner, Gafhi, Ruben- stein, and Boyarin. Jews and Christians in Mesopotamia developed similar insti- tutions aimed at inculcating a specific pedagogical religious identity in young males who traveled to them. This similar notion of the student who would later become the teacher corresponds to the shared pedagogical metaphors the two cul- tures of learning employed in talking about God and the projection of this peda- gogical imagery onto an imagined biblical past. These schools provided a particular scholarly habitus (including deportment, implicit values, and identity) and advocated ritualized study as an obligation with as much religious valence as prayer.85 Furthermore, the East Syrian and rabbinic material may be compared as scholastic systems engaged in certain kinds of reason and argumentation: Aris- totelian for one, halakhic for the other. The recognized indeterminacy of the Baby- lonian Talmud finds its correlative in the apophatic theology of the upper echelons of East Syrian study, that is, the Evagrian spirituality of the monastery.86 Compe- tition was an important element in both of these cultures of learning, and a system of honors and punishments that functioned to prevent deviance, such as we find among the rabbis, is also identifiable in the East Syrian school sources.87 We find the eroticization of learning in both religious traditions, the object of desire being the Torah in one and Jesus the Bridegroom in the other. Such an eroticization inversely corresponds to the generally ascetic attitude taken to study, and often to life.88 Characteristics such as these may also be labeled as shared content, but, structurally speaking, this eroticization represents part of the affect that kept the system going. The East Syrians and the rabbis projected their scholastic practice into heaven and the biblical past.89 Numerous examples attest to a scholasticizing of 84. Cf. Becker, Fear of God, 16-17. Unfortunately, I did not have time to incorporate into this article Boyarin 's new book, Socrates and the Fat Rabbis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), which suggests that the rabbis had access, even if through oral transmission, to Greek authors such as Plato and Lucian via the Christian community. This is highly implausible. 85. See, e.g., Becker, Fear of God, 204-209 ("Conclusion: Study as Ritual in the Church of the East"). 86. David C.

Becker history: later Babylonian sources understand Roman imperial "persecution" of Jews specifically as an attempt to restrict access to Torah (i.e., as an obstruction of study), whereas the East Syrian Cause of the Foundation of the Schools pro- vides a history of learning from the time of God's creation of the world to the time of the text's composition in the late sixth century CE by recasting patriarchal, Israelite, "pagan," and Christian history as a long series of schools.90 Furthermore, East Syrian and rabbinic sources both self-consciously attempted to reconcile their relationship to a tradition deriving from the distant West. Just as Jewish learning and traditions, after a period of back-and-forth exchange between Palestine and Babylonia, arrived in Mesopotamia from the littoral of the Mediterranean basin, so was there a continual influx of "Western" texts and ideas into the Mesopotamian Christian milieu.91 The rabbis and the East Syrians felt the need to renegotiate imaginatively this long-distance transmission of learning.92 This led to the development of what we can perhaps call a scholastic historiographical paradigm in both communities. However, in contrast to the Babylonian Talmud and later geonic responsa, only rarely did East Syrian texts move west- ward (e.g., Cassiodorus mentions the School of Nisibis in the beginning of his Institutes)?3 The conversion of the protagonist in the History of Mar Aba, the East Syrian Catholicos who died in 552, serves as a prime example of the pedagogical under- standing of Christianity common to many East Syrian sources.94 Before his con- version to Christianity, we are told, Aba met up with an East Syrian "schoolman" ( 'eskoldya) whose deportment and humble dress impressed him. According to the text, Aba was unable to tell whether this man was a Jew or a Christian.95 Aba's conversion is described in pedagogical terms, and soon after he became a Chris- tian, according to the History, he entered the School of Nisibis. As I have suggested elsewhere, this text takes for granted that a Zoroastrian could have 90.

It is the pedagogical paradigm shared by Jews and Christians in this Meso- potamian context that allows for Mar Aba's confusion. In comparing the East Syrian and rabbinic academies, we should bear in mind the shared timeline. Although there is much disagreement in the secondary literature, it seems that the earliest Babylonian Jewish academies developed between 450 and 650, precisely the same time as the spread of East Syrian schools throughout Sasa- nian Mesopotamia. What do we make of this? Do we simply say that schools and scholastic ideology were a shared discourse between Jews and Christians at this time? It is clear from looking at the history of the School of Nisibis that one contribut- ing factor to its development as a formal institution at the turn of the sixth century was the model that the monastery offered for such a social organization. Perhaps, then, the East Syrian schools spread more quickly and widely because of this institutional pre- decessor. Furthermore, endowments of monasteries and schools were not uncom- mon within the Church of the East, an aspect that raises comparable economic questions for looking at the slower, but eventual, rise of rabbinic academies.97 Sep- arate factors such as these need to be delineated, but at the same time, our analysis requires that we address the problem of identical phenomena in a shared spatial and ideological realm. To simply describe the situation as a "shared discourse" risks providing an overly theoretical and anemic explanation. The problem I am addressing may be exemplified in the pedagogical version of Jesus imagined by both communities. It has been commonly noticed that Jesus as he appears in the Talmud and in later Jewish tradition (e.g., in the Toledot Yeshu) is depicted as a student, and a bad one at that, who sometimes engaged in illicit magical practices.98 Modem scholars seem to understand this as reflecting the rabbinic ten- dency to put things in scholastic terms, in the same way that biblical patriarchs are understood in the Talmud to be members of a yeshivah. Now that we are aware of how thoroughly pedagogically inclined, practically through actual institutions as well as metaphorically, the Church of the East was, it seems that the yeshivah bokher Jesus is not simply a rabbinic distortion. Rather, it is an inversion of the East Syrians' Jesus, a teacher who founded a new school for humanity and taught through both his words and his death.99 The pedagogical paradigm shared by the two groups created a link bridging the chasm caused by their own ideological and 96.

This is comparable to the dialogic relation between Judaism and Christianity posited by Israel Yuval, who argues that the two traditions employ mutually constitutive, reciprocal images - as when, for example, medieval Christian accusations of ritual murder, the so-called blood libel, may be read next to the Jewish martyrological response to attacks on Jews during the First Crusade.100 The common world of enchantment Another perspective is offered by the incantation bowls from late antique and early Islamic Mesopotamia. Two related aspects of the economy and circulation of the bowls that point to a religious space shared by Jews, Christians, and others are, first, that they served as objects of exchange between members of different com- munities, and, second, that the form of ritual expertise required to produce them fit into a larger intercreedal system in which the learned scribe had power over health, wealth, and the other mundane matters that make up many of the concerns of what we call "religion." As Michael Morony states, "The incantation texts themselves provide social information for a population about which there is virtually no other source of knowledge."101 Judging from the scripts and the names of the clients, it seems that the market- place for the bowls was wider than the creedal boundaries set up by the religious elites of each community. Jews seem to have been the most common producers of bowls, but they also produced them for people with particularly un- Jewish names.102 Formulae are shared from one religio-conununal dialect to the next, with rabbinic figures appearing in Syriac and Jesus being invoked in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. Assessing the incantation bowls, Shaul Shaked writes, "One can speak of a broad common denominator in the field of popular religious beliefs, around which members of different communities could be united, and which made it possible for them to turn to magic specialists outside their own community."104 100.

Learning was authoritative, and the language of learning was employed in a number of places where we would not expect it, functioning to expand its discursive range into areas not usually labeled as belong- ing to the realm of learning. For example, the standard Syriac word for conversion to Christianity, 'ettalmad (the passive of the denominative verb meaning, literally, "to be made a student"), and the Mandaean word for a lower-level priest, tarmida, are both cognate with, and derive from, the Hebrew talmid. The scribe as religious figure already had a long history in Mesopotamia, and the Babylonian god of scribes, Nebo (Nabu), remained popular even in late antiquity.105 Furthermore, outsiders to this culture of sacral literacy were drawn in from the periphery. For example, Arabs in Petra and Palmyra inherited Aramaic literacy and, with it, the worship of Nebo.106 This elevation of the man of esoteric learning to a place of symbolic and religious power within Sasanian culture may also be under- stood as structurally parallel to the existence of such scribal authority within the bureaucracy of the Sasanian Empire.107 The content of learning was specific to different communities (except for shared scriptures), but the ideology of learning was common to them all. This ideology of learning was concomitant with the insti- tutionalization of the transmission of knowledge among these different religious communities, even if orality, for example, was the dominant mode of transmitting knowledge among Zoroastrians and rabbis. On a level other than that of communal elites, we can see the power of learning playing out in the incantation bowls. The bowls attest to a popular interest in writing that may be seen as directly parallel to that of the literate religious elites of the period and inversely related to the rejection of writing by some. The use of bills of divorce for banishing vexatious demons, the invocation of scriptural verses, and the insertion of Mishnah passages into the "in the name of (be-shum) formulae, as well as the aping of textuality and scholarly practices within these ritual objects through fake writing, all demonstrate the existence of a belief in the power of written words among consumers of such objects.108 The use of incantation bowls and the importance attributed to writing in this ritual technology are but two intercreedal phenomena - that is, religious discourses that transcended religious communal boundaries. The "magic" of the bowls serves as another paradigm shared by Jews and Christians (and others), 105. Ted Kaizer, The Religious Life of Palmyra (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2002), 89-99; H. J. W.

Becker while at the same time, the emphasis on writing and esoteric knowledge. to which they attest suggests that this paradigm overlapped in certain areas with the pedago- gical one. This helps explain why Jesus, the wayward student, is taken to be engaged in magic by the rabbis: this action is not simply a rationalizing attempt to explain his power, but also it renders him in an idiom, like the pedagogical one, that others can recognize. The transposability of the scholastic paradigm that we see here is also apparent in the "scholastic magic" studied by Swartz, who argues that "social circles outside of the academy took up rabbinic scholasti- cism and made it their own."109 Conclusion More work needs to be done. This is both the conclusion and the main point of this article. In an oft-cited piece, "Jewish Traditions in Syriac Sources," Sebas- tian Brock suggests that the fourth century saw the end of living Jewish traditions being employed by Syriac authors.110 However, the connections that have been drawn for the fourth century with a number of Syriac texts may be attributable, at least in part, to a closer study of these texts (e.g., the writings of Aphrahat and Ephrem or the Martyrdom of Simeon bar Sabba 'e). Further study of East Syrian sources would perhaps confirm this, but it seems that the divergence Brock finds remains true - with regard to content. On the rabbinic front, the dis- cussion of the minim and minut as heresiological terms continues,111 and there is recent work suggesting that we can find knowledge and intentional parodying of the Gospels specifically in the Babylonian Talmud.112 However, as Richard Kalmin states, "the universe of experience of Babylonian rabbis, more so than of Palestinians, tended not to extend beyond the four walls of the study house."113 Much of Kalmin 's recent book emphasizes the "internally focused character" of the rabbis.114 In the rabbinic sources, again, no smoking gun of Jewish-Christian contact is going to be found. As I have argued, we should be thinking about religious diversity and struc- tural parallels rather than creating lists of shared terminology and exegesis or evi- dence of boundary-breaking Jews who were interested in Christianity, even if there were a few such people.115 For example, we might further consider the usefulness of the rubric of scholasticism for thinking about rabbinic Judaism and the Christian 109.

Furthermore, a broader, comparative study of similar cultures of learning may help us think about this material, as it could work in other fields, such as South Asia, where the sources are more extensive and diverse.116 As with the Syriac sources, Armenian, Middle Persian, and other sources are yet to be plumbed to their depths. Some will perhaps posit that despite numerous overlaps, rabbinic and East Syrian institutions of learning differ in essence. However, this would render certain practices and ideas, which the rabbis and East Syrians understood as central in their own communities (e.g., Torah and Jesus), to be the sole categories for interpreting the life of the schools. We must listen to our sources, but not be seduced by them so as to allow their internal, subjective self-understanding to serve as the only objective terms of analysis. This would result in a reification of rabbinic and East Syrian subjectivity, thus reiterating their perspective and reifying what is already a religious reification!117 Furthermore, it is not enough to recognize the pluralism, if I may use that term, of the Sasanian Empire, as it remains necessary to reassess our notion of Sasanian or any other premodern cultural and religious pluralism, lest we anachro- nistically understand religious diversity in modern pluralistic terms (i.e., as diverse religious communities participating either in a transparent common ground of shared core values or in an independent secular space, in either case a society where, as Charles Taylor examines in his recent book, A Secular Age, belief is treated as an option).118 It is now commonplace to point out that the category of religion, as it is used today, is a modern invention. Therefore, religious diversity as it is commonly understood, as well as the intercommunal dynamic within this diversity, needs to be reconfigured when we address religion before the modern political theological formation that has produced "religion."119 Adam H. Becker New York University New York, New York 116. Again, see the essays in Jose Ignacio Cabezon, Scholasticism.
