Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996. xviii, 262 pp. Initially a 1992 Ph.D. dissertation at Columbia University, this monograph is a specimen of perfection in bringing a research project to its fulfillment through publication. The clarity of method with which Birnbaum traces Philo's use of terms</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 251 and analyzes their context in passages that define Jewish identity from biblical Israel to his own time, tracking them down separately through each of his three exegetical series (the Allegory, the Exposition, and the Questions and Answers on Genesis and Exodus), sets a standard for word studies and exegetical analyses in voluminous authors. Her lucid introduction paves the way for a well-guided tour into Philo's thought: the ideas which he uses in his interpretation of passages regarding ancient Israel and in his references to his people. Besides highlighting his particular and mostly systematic use of the term "Israel" vis-a-vis other proper nouns designating the patriarchs or the people of God, such as Hebraios, Chaldaios, and Ioudaios, Birnbaum considers his use of related key words like genos, ethnos, laos, politeia, etc. Her delineations of these terms in the light of their Philonic usage and her frequent summaries make this otherwise technical study an interesting reading for the nonspecialist as well as for the specialist. Most of the book is devoted to unpacking the recurring meaning Philo gives to "Israel" in his exegetical treatises as horon, hor6n theon, horatikos, horatikon genos, horatikon kai epistemonikon genos, all suggesting a special relationship with God in which all people-Jews and non-Jews-might participate in "seeing" the truly Existent. Obviously, the meaning Philo gives to "Israel," however ambiguous, derives from his understanding of the Hebrew etymology of the name as "one that sees God" (linguistically and contextually linked with Gen. 32:29 [p. 31]). Bimbaum observes that on the whole he refers to Israel as seeing God much less frequently in the Exposition than in the other two exegetical series. Her explanation that this has to do with Philo's intended audience(s) is very convincing, especially as we come to realize that Philo started out as an exegete and gradually became more and more apologetic in his later works. This is further indicated by her observation that outside the exegetical writings the etymological meaning of Israel as seeing God is found but once, in De Legatione ad Gaium 4. The greater justification for Birnbaum's study, however, comes in the form of a question: "If Philo does allow for a legitimate relationship with God outside Judaism, then how shall we assess the place of Judaism in his thought?" In the course of her research the "if"' becomes "since," and further interesting observations emerge, such as Philo's referring to "Israel" as genos ("race/class") and not as laos ("people") or ethnos ("nation"). Ultimately, the question is answered by appealing to Philo's presentation of Judaism as a philosophy and to his own commitment to being a Jew, seen in his involvement with the Alexandrian Jewish community and its way of life.</page><page sequence="3">252 BOOK REVIEWS Birnbaum seems to be aware of the characteristic weaknesses of word studies that seldom venture beyond the sought terms into the concepts that lie beneath them. A good example of this is her observation of the fact that Philo never uses the word "Judaism" even though the term was current in his time. Yet, as she points out, the concept of Judaism is prevalent in his thought as a philosophy that leads to the one true God and as a way of life experienced in the Jewish community. Consequently, she is absolutely right in the pursuit of her subject by (1) singling out Judaism as the only first-century monotheistic religion and (2) dwelling on the place of monotheism in Philo's thought. Although the Judaism in Philo's thought is neither defined nor identified, we may presume that it represents the beliefs, concepts, and customs of postbiblical Judaism with which he was chiefly in contact-with all its diversity. It need hardly be stressed that Philo was very much at home in matters of halakhah and haggadah. Yet Birnbaum's study, unlike earlier studies that approximate her work, is not an exploration of Judaism in Philo's thought with the purpose of ascertaining above all else how justified--or unjustified-the strictures of Alexandrian Judaism are vis-a-vis the Palestinian or rabbinic tradition, or what some would call "mainstream" or "normative" Judaism. Because Philo refers to one of his visits to the Land of Israel near the end of the second book of De Providentia, we would presume that he was acquainted with the prevalent traditions there. Moreover, his exegetical works indicate that he was cognizant of more than one well-defined form of Jewish religious expression, if not also of several groups or sects. Even a degree of Apocalyptic Judaism is discernible in his De Praemiis et Poenis. Indeed, Philo himself may have belonged to a priestly family with a long-standing commitment to ancestral practices and devotion to the Pentateuch in its Greek version. By not defining Philo's Judaism, Bimbaum seems to avoid what in our day has been a false and one-sided presentation of Jewish theology in Late Antiquity, a presentation to which there has been considerable reaction in recent decades. There can be no doubt, however, that Philo's Judaism was shaped not only by the Judeo-Greek works of his predecessors, who wrote for apologetic purposes, but also by the experiences of the large Jewish community in Alexandria, which, as everywhere in the Greco-Roman world, included slaves, fugitives, annual workers, craftsmen, and others who were deliberately marginalized by Roman policies well known to Philo. Moreover, as Birnbaum points out, Judaism challenged the prevailing cultural norms of the Greco- Roman world through its family and community lifestyle to the point of being</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 253 countercultural. Given the sociopolitical realities of the time, especially the turmoil in Alexandria, the observations made in the last chapter ("Proselytes in Relation to God, Jews, and 'Israel' ") become doubly significant. Here again, Philo reserves the term "Israel" for those spiritually qualified or privileged to see God, regardless of ancestry. More importantly, it is not as though proselytes constituted new communities that marked the boundary separating Jews and non-Jews. Proselytes are considered Jews for having come over to the laws and worship of the one God; they are part of the Jewish community. There is no description, however, of the rite(s) by which proselytes join the collectivity, and this, perhaps, is because of Philo's silence on the subject. One misses some analysis in this chapter of the "dialogue" of Judaism with paganism, as Philo obviously endeavored in some of his works, especially in the Exposition. It must be said that The Place of Judaism in Philo s Thought is a very cautious study, and Birnbaum has given us a definitive work on what Philo means by his numerous uses of the word "Israel" besides other terms that define Judaism in the first century. Authors are seldom faulted for what they do not discuss, and their vulnerability to adverse criticism is often limited to downright blunders in what they assert. Birnbaum, by contrast, deserves to be commended profusely for the thoroughness of her coverage of the subject and the absence of any discernible inaccuracies in her work. She could well say with Philo, "May I never devote study and pains to anything of which I am not afterwards to be a defender" (Quod Deterius Potiori Insidiari Solet 64).
