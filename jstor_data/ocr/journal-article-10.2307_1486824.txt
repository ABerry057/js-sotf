<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Mordechai Cogan. Obadiah: Introduction and Commentary. Uriel Simon. Jonah: Introduction and Commentary. Miqra' le-Yisra'el. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1993. xi, 96 pp. (Hebrew) These two works appear under one cover in the new series, Miqra' le- Yisra'el, edited by Moshe Greenberg and Shmuel Ahituv. The series carries the subtitle Perus' Mada'i La-Miqrd', "A Scientific Bible Commentary." Indeed, each of the studies under review here is both a Bible commentary for Israel and a scientific Bible commentary. The Hebrew in the "Bible Commentary for Israel" is modern, clear, and to the point, thus making the latest Scripture scholarship accessible to the Hebrew-reading public in a pleasing form. Simon's language and style, moreover, are even rich and elegant. The mada'i, or "scientific," designation in the subtitle is an apt one, in that the approach is a critical investigation of the classical biblical literature. Neither work in the volume under review is merely a textual and historical study, although both investigators do address these exegetical aspects to the degree that their respective books allow. For example, beyond the name "Obadiah" in the superscription to the book so designated, the Bible provides no details regarding the identity and time of the prophet. This has given rise to many theories. Mordechai Cogan succinctly presents an historical review of the various identifications of the prophet and his time. Cogan begins with the Talmud's equation of the prophet with the Obadiah who was over the palace during the reign of Ahab (b. Sanh. 39b): "Rabbi Isaac said, 'Why did Obadiah merit the gift of prophecy? Because he hid one hundred prophets in the cave' " (cf. 1 Kgs 18:4). There is, however, no basis for this identification in the words of the prophet himself. Cogan then cites several Jewish and Gentile views propounded in the course of time up to the present. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (12th cent.), for example, wrote, "We do not know his [Obadiah's] generation, and we cannot say that he is the one mentioned in 389</page><page sequence="2">390 BOOK REVIEWS Kings." Rabbi David Qimhi (13th cent.) held: "This prophecy was [uttered] in the time of the Second Temple because of the Edomites' mistreatment of Israel." Even today there is no unanimity. The approach our commentator takes is to compare the words of Obadiah (vv. 10-14) to the many descriptions of Edom's active participation in the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 B.C.E. (see Ezek 25:12, 35:5; Lam 4:21; Ps 137:7). On the basis of this comparison Cogan concludes that the prophecy belongs to the period of the destruction, perhaps as that of an eyewitness. Uriel Simon also deals with the historical dimension in his study of the book of Jonah. But in the case of Simon's Introduction and Commentary, the great value and force is in the sensitivity to style and lucid literary explication of the biblical work. Simon displays these qualities particularly in his introductory essay on the theme(s) of the book. The biblical short story's preference for indirect expression over explicit ideational, ethical, and psychological statements is obvious in Jonah. It is therefore difficult to uncover the one central unifying theme. Under four basic headings, Simon examines the numerous views, from rabbinic midrashim to modern biblical exegesis, that have been advanced. The four headings are "Repentance and Forgiveness," "Israel and the Gentiles," "False Prophet and True Prophet," and "Justice and Mercy." Our commentator clearly presents the several positions in the name of their proponents and then provides his own critique and endorsement of each. The writer of Jonah masterfully embellishes the story with intensive wordplays that complement and reinforce the strong thematic coherence. Simon's careful reading and aesthetic sense prove equal to the task of elucidating, for modern reader and scholar alike, the many literary gems in the book of Jonah. Simon does not fall prey to the all-too-common practice of merely pointing to rhetorical devices. Each stylistic feature plays a role in the total work. The accomplished biblical artist introduced significant features creating particular effects. The able critic identifies the features and demonstrates their significance. Examples of two of Simon's insightful explanations of the recurrence of key words and not their mere identification follow: First, he points out that in the scene aboard ship, the verb twl in the Hiph'il construction, "cast" or "throw," appears three times: in the presentation of the problem-"The Lord cast (hif.tf) a great wind upon the sea" (v. 5); in its erroneous solution-"They threw (hi.tla) the cargo that was in the ship into the sea" (v. 5); and in its</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 391 correct solution-"They picked up Jonah and cast him (wayyittfla) into the sea" (v. 15). The second example is the repetition of the verb yd', "know," which serves to contrast the prophet's confident knowledge in the ship ("for I know," 1:12) and in Nineveh ("for I knew," 4:2) with the sailors' desperate request for knowledge ("so that we may know," 1:7), the religious humility of the Ninevite king ("who knows," 3:9), and the lack of knowledge that shields the myriads of children of the city from destruction ("who do not know," 4:11). The two commentaries are fine examples of biblical scholarship. By the nature of the the biblical book that each examines, the more valuable study is clearly Simon's work on Jonah. Theological, moral, and psychological insights abound within a well-crafted whole in Jonah, and Simon explicates these and other relevant aspects masterfully. Obadiah, the smallest book in the Hebrew Bible, numbering a mere twenty-one verses, illustrates the care the canonizers took to preserve even small, isolated prophecies. Obviously, however, the abbreviated size and genre of Obadiah do not permit Cogan to make the same contribution that Simon does. Nevertheless, within a neces- sarily smaller compass Cogan treats in an able manner issues of language, style, history, and intertextuality that arise from the words of Obadiah. Cogan's Obadiah and Simon's Jonah well deserve the labels "A Bible Commentary for Israel" and "A Scientific Bible Commentary." The general reader as well as the scholar will derive much benefit from the two works in this volume. Daniel Grossberg State University of New York at Albany Albany, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
