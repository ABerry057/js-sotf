Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. xvi, 301 pp. The attention given to the Jew in England in the later years of the nineteenth century owes much to Disraeli's overwhelming presence. Brian Cheyette quotes a famous letter of Goldwin Smith: "The secret of Lord Beaconsfield's life lies in his Jewish blood. . . . Certainly a century and a quarter of residence in England on the part of his ancestors and himself has left little trace on the mind and character of Lord Beaconsfield. He is in almost every essential . . . a Jew" (p. 15). What to make of Lord Beaconsfield and of his theories about race was an important aspect of the British response to Jews. For Disraeli the Jew represented the spiritual nature of man, and "religion, property, and natural aristocracy" (p. 55). Because Disraeli was associated with imperialism and foreign possessions, when imperialism foundered, as it did in the Boer War, Jews were often blamed. As Cheyette argues in chapter 3, "Both Buchan and Kipling were to locate a supposed Jewish financial power within the realm of Empire in terms which were to oppose liberal and socialist constructions of mythologized 'Jewish financiers' in Southern Africa" (p. 92). In Lord George Bentinck: A Political Biography, a remarkable book of self-writing that is often as much a disguised autobiography as a biography of its subject, Disraeli writes: "The Jews represent the Semitic principle: all that is spiritual in nature. They are the trustees of tradition, and the conservators of the religious element. They are a living and the most striking evidence of the falsity of that pernicious doctrine of modern times, the natural equality of man" (p. 59). But rather than blame Disraeli for introducing racial discourse, one should understand him as taking up a defensive position to ward off those who would have excluded Jews from Parliament and who</page><page sequence="2">434 BOOK REVIEWS denigrated his qualifications because of his ancestors. Cheyette shows how the English response to the Dreyfus case included virulent antisemitism on the part of Belloc and Chesterton, who used the 1911-14 Marconi financial scandal to justify their antagonistic position on Dreyfus. And by quoting from contemporary biographer-apologists of those figures, Cheyette shows how antisemitism was reinscribed from generation to generation. What Cheyette discusses with remarkable insight and thoroughness is "the protean instability of 'the Jew' as signifier" (p. 8). He defines his mission boldly: "This study of semitic 'cultural difference' is an attempt to rewrite the discipline of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century English literature by placing a dominant racialized discourse at the heart of what constitutes the received definitions of literary 'culture' " (p. 4). Cheyette argues that the Jew was perceived as a double figure-simultaneously a mysterious exotic other like Disraeli, with magical potential to hypnotize the English into acceptance, and an insidious force to corrupt the purity of the British race. In each case, the British totemized him as Outsider. As Cheyette makes clear in his shrewd discussion of Culture and Anarchy, "The acculturated 'Jew', in terms of this ambivalent Arnoldian liberalism, was an extreme example of those that may draw closer to 'grace' and 'beauty' by surpassing an unaesthetic, worldly Hebraism" (p. 5). Yet the presence of Jews, increased in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by emigration from tsarist Russia, exacerbated "the fear that a supposedly homogeneous national culture was being overwhelmed by an unassimilable 'other' " (p. 6). Cheyette's reading of Culture and Anarchy is particularly shrewd. Con- sciously or unconsciously responding to the antisemitism of Thomas Arnold, his father, Matthew Arnold proposed the idea of a transforming culture "where Jews, newly assimilated into the nation-state, exemplify the Enlightenment virtues of tolerance, justice and equality" (p. 5). For Arnold, Hebraism was "both an alien 'semitic growth' and, at the same time, a metonym for the English Puritan tradition" (p. 20). The liberal humanist Arnold believed that culture could transcend racial differences, but-and this is a significant but-for Arnold, as Cheyette puts it, "The 'other' . . . must divest itself of racial particularism before being assimilated into a supposedly universalist culture" (p. 20). Cheyette shows that Jews became whatever English writers needed them to be: cosmopolitan or unpolished and boorish; capitalists indifferent to the national interest or homogenizing socialists. He shows how "writers [did]</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 435 not draw on the eternal myths of 'the Jew' but actively construct[ed] them in relation to their own literary and political concerns" (p. 268). Indeed, Jews were totemized into Other much as hegemonic cultures always do to their minorities--and now, alas, as all too many cultural enclaves do to all outsiders. For English writers Jews have often served the role of a cultural psychotherapist on whom are projected whatever feelings are inherent in the writers; thus the constructions of Jews are really submerged English autobiographical and cultural data. What and how we totemize Other, including ideological constructs that justify the act of totemization-as Doestoevsky shows in his great Grand Inquisitor scene in the Brothers Karamazov, where Ivan constructs a dialogue that reflects his needs, and his character the Grand Inquisitor does the same-says everything about ourselves. I have some trouble with Cheyette's discounting of the teleological significance of the Holocaust: "Unlike other studies of pre-war literary anti-semitism, which mistakenly foreground the Holocaust, my approach is to stress the enlightened expectation that a superior 'culture' can modernize and civilize even 'the Jew' " (p. xi). And some of the terminology of cultural studies troubles me in a book which necessarily has and should have a humanistic cast: "As with Joyce, Eliot's poetry constructed 'the Jew' as a site of confusion and uncertainty" (p. 207). I found his discussion of Eliot quite compelling, but I think he somewhat misreads the dramatized consciousness of the antisemitic speaker of Eliot's Gerontion: "But the indeterminacy in Eliot's use of language is reflected, in particular, in Gerontion's own inability to completely separate himself from 'the jew"' (p. 247). Gerontion may unwittingly speak in the base language he would attribute to Jews, but Cheyette's formulation is reductive. While his reading of Joyce's Ulysses has many fine insights, I cannot always follow the logic of the argument. He argues that "Joyce makes [Bloom] the site on which to challenge the reader's faith in a literary text to order 'reality' " (p. 206). Or: "His refusal to contain 'the Jew' within a realistic narrative, therefore, should be linked to his skepticism concerning conventional, modernizing discourses" (p. 218). Cheyette interweaves many prior critics and perhaps does not quite find his own voice. He misses the important link between Bloom and the Hasidic legend of the Lamed Vav-the thirty-six Just Men. Driven by his thematic engine, he also-perhaps understandably-misses much of Joyce's humor and fun in the passages he</page><page sequence="4">436 BOOK REVIEWS discusses. It is surprising that he does not take up why Joyce refers so frequently to the Boer War and why Bloom is associated with the Boer hero Christiaan de Wet. In fact, the Irish were particularly sympathetic with the Boers as fellow victims of imperialism, but perhaps Joyce is drawing a parallel between Bloom and other discriminated Jews, since in England Jews were being blamed for the Boer War by people who thought like Joyce's Deasy-the antisemitic Ulsterman in the "Nestor" section of Ulysses. Yet Cheyette has some compelling moments on Ulysses: "Far from postulating an alternative 'Jewish' history of 'persecution' to that of the Citizen's chauvinism, Bloom's uncertain Jewishness is set against the fixity of the myths of Irish nationhood which are ruthlessly parodied throughout this episode" (p. 221). Cheyette sees literary works as sites where discourses are constructed as if they were buildings; but while one can admire the architectonics of buildings, Cheyette sometimes gives aesthetic concerns-as opposed to thematic issues-short shrift. The burgeoning field of cultural studies has become a respectable way of introducing thematic concerns into literary studies, whereas I grew up in a world where themes took a back seat to formal and aesthetic considerations. The concept of site has succeeded text as if authors were building constructions on ground that they had cleared. (We might recall the architectonic metaphors of the New Criticism, as influential formalism of the thirties through sixties which eschewed contextualism.) Nor is this book without the jargon of cultural studies, a jargon that has its own essentialistic premises: "While the historicizing of the semitic discourse under consideration avoids the essentialism that may be associated with the eternally 'mythic' construction of 'the Jew,' it should be stressed that it is as subjects of a 'discourse' and not as historical subjects that 'Jews' are situated in the literary texts under consideration" (p. 11). Of course every theoretical approach, including cultural studies-and of course deconstruction, its once powerful predecessor as the theoretical Holy Grail-substitutes its own kind of essentialism for others. At times, has not New Historicism and its offspring cultural studies become a kind of imperialism, willfully changing the geography of the literary texts they discuss to include subjects areas outside the borders of literary studies and willfully changing the semiotics to fit its own purposes? Cheyette has written an important and well-researched study, even while raising issues about the field of cultural studies. Cheyette's historical scope and his wide and deep reading are impressive. His chapter titles give a sense</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 437 of the range of his studies: "The Promised Land of Liberalism: Matthew Arnold, Anthony Trollope and George Eliot"; "Empire and Anarchy: John Buchan and Rudyard Kipling"; "The 'Socialism of Fools': George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells"; "The Limits of Liberalism: Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton"; "Modernism and Ambivalence: James Joyce and T. S. Eliot." It might have been useful to devote an entire chapter to Disraeli, since the response to him seems to play such a pivotal role in the subsequent English constructions of Jews, especially Arnold's and Buchan's. Cheyette might have had a coda on post-World War II constructions of the Jews, including Ishiguru's The Remains of the Day, for is it not the kind of racial discourses Cheyette discusses that leads to the rationalizations of that novel's Lord Darlington? And does not that book show how the teleology of the Holocaust is always a major signifier? And he needs more on how the various waves of Jewish immigration impacted on the writers he discusses. Clifford Geertz has written, "The problem of the integration of cultural life becomes one of making it possible for people inhabiting different worlds to have a genuine, and reciprocal, impact upon one another."' Disraeli's encounter with the dominant culture and his triumphant, if contentious, political career teach us that culture is dynamic, and at any given point heteroglossic, a dialogue of diverse thoughts, feelings, goals, and values. According to Isaiah Berlin, "Cultures-the sense of what the world meant to societies, of men's and women's collective sense of themselves in relation to others and the environment, that which affects particular forms of thought, feeling, behavior, action-... cultures differ."2 What we learn from Cheyette's study is that we need to honor cultural differences and respect the claims of cultural enclaves.
