<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KELIM AND OHALOT By JACOB NEUSNER Brown University The central conception distinguishing rabbinic Judaism from all other conceptions of Judaism, past and present, is the belief in the myth of Moses as "our rabbi," and the conception that when God-also conceived in the model of the rabbi-revealed the Torah to Moses, he gave Torah in two parts, one in writing, the other as tradition handed on orally.' The tradition handed on orally is now contained in the Mishnah and its cognate literature, Tosefta, Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds, the various Mid- rashim, and the like. Accordingly, at the center of Rabbinic Judaism is the concept of the dual Torah and the fundamental conviction that the written Torah is not the whole record of revelation. Indeed, one may say that just 1.

Accordingly, from the beginning of modern Jewish scholarship, one crucial problem in the study of the history of Judaism has been the nature and meaning, defined in particular in terms of the origins and development, of Mishnah. In traditional circles, this problem, of course, was readily solved. The contents of the Mishnah constitute Torah shebe'al peh; their history is co- extensive with that of Torah shebikhtav. That conception is phrased in historical language, and, when so stated, is hardly compelling. But, as I shall try to show, that conception, when viewed from another, a phenom- enological, angle, is essentially correct and represents a wholly accurate interpretation of the nature and meaning of Oral Torah. The reason that modern Orthodoxy phrased its conception of Torah shebe'al peh in historical, rather than theological, terms is that Orthodoxy had to respond to the claim, also phrased in historical language, of Jewish scholarship beginning in the nineteenth century, that the concept of Torah shebe'al peh is to be defined in terms of beginnings and growth, under- stood in the light of origins and change. Since the Reformers approached the reform of the tradition through historical means, the traditionalists re- affirmed the convictions of tradition in historical language. It was unavoid- able. What is it that the Reformers alleged concerning the origins and meaning of Torah shebe'al peh? The Reformers, beginning with Zechariah Frankel, saw the Oral Torah as historical and contingent, not supernatural and autonomous. Oral Torah was represented as the product of the exegesis of the Written Torah. It had no independent existence, no autonomy as a separate corpus of revela- tion, correlative to Torah shebikhtav. The Mishnah is the end-product of about six centuries of the exegesis of Scripture. Frankel held that the scribes explained the commandments, then joined their explanation to the written Scriptures. This, he said, is the crux of the oral law. Only later on were materials organized thematically, rather than exegetically, that is, by the formulation of abstract law, "law which was meant to explain an issue of the Torah without being attached to the text of the Torah." So the beginning of Oral Torah did not lie in remote antiquity-the time of Moses-but in the time of Ezra and the scribes. The Mishnah in no way is to be regarded as an autonomous and separate Torah, but merely as the</page><page sequence="3">JACOB NEUSNER 153 end of a long period of study and exegesis of the one written Torah of Sinai. The Mishnah serves merely to organize vast quantities of exegetic- ally based laws. It would carry us far afield to investigate the historical circumstances, intellectual influences, and philosophical necessities, which led Frankel, Briill, and their successors to the present day to stress the historical origin of Torah shebe'al peh in the period from Ezra to the editing of the Mish- nah, accomplished through the process of exegesis. Rather, let us test their most fundamental allegation, that Oral Torah essentially is nothing more than the exegesis of Written Torah, against the evidence of Mishnah itself. It seems to me that it is only by an inductive inquiry into the actual inter- relationships between Mishnah and Scriptural law that we shall come to a sound picture of what classical, Rabbinic Judaism really understood by Mishnah, that is, by Oral Torah. I hasten to add that the issue is not felicitously phrased in terms of Frankel's theory or of the traditional and Orthodox conception either. That is to say, when we ask about the relationship between Oral Torah, represented by Mishnah-Tosefta, and the written Torah, we stand wholly within the mythic framework established by the second- and third-century rabbis. In point of fact, so far as Mishnah and Scripture are related, it is because the one holds views diametrically opposite those of the other upon the same issue. As we shall see, Scripture-Leviticus and Numbers-takes for granted that cleanness is important only in the Temple. The Oral Torah -Kelim, also Parah-takes for granted that cleanness interpenetrates the world outside of the Temple. Scripture assumes that the priests are in charge, the Oral Torah-Negaim-assumes that the sage is in charge. Scripture speaks of tents, places in which people live. Mishnah Ohalot, as we shall show, is about the Tent, a space capable of retaining, or inter- posing against, that which exudes from the corpse upon death. In other words, while Mishnah does much with the themes of Scripture, in the tractates under study it always rejects even the simplest suppositions of Scripture. Why then should we ask ourselves to analyze Mishnah in terms of the rabbinic myth of correlative and autonomous Torahs? And there is a further consideration. Mishnah-Tosefta, in the tractates before us (as in other tractates, except for Avot), is not a work which claims to constitute Torah at all. We do not come across a single sentence in Mishnah-Tosefta Kelim, Ohalot, or, for that matter, Negaim and Parah, in which Mosaic or Scriptural authority is claimed to stand behind or</page><page sequence="4">154 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH generate a rule. True, once in a while, particularly in Negaim, we find exegeses in which Scripture provides proof-texts for a proposition. But said proposition also is established without proof-texts. In any case, it is difficult to demonstrate either that laws were created by looking into Scripture (Negaim in fact is a special case, for reasons spelled out in my History of the Mishnaic Law of Purities. VII. Negaim. Sifra); or that Mishnah-Tosefta for the tractates before us ever was conceived within the scheme of the two Torahs of Moses "our rabbi." That conception, I think, comes after the completion and promulgation of Mishnah, and does not stand at the outset of the process of the formulation of the law. I am inclined to think that the history of the myth of the two Torahs is separate from, though intertwined with, the association of that myth with Mishnah-Tosefta in particular. We may for the moment observe that our tractates are remarkably uninterested in Moses "our rabbi" and in his dual Torah. The real problem facing modern scholarship of Mishnah is the defini- tion of Mishnah. The established framework of argument presents us with two choices: Mishnah is a law-code, or Mishnah is a school-book. But when we ask, What is Mishnah? in fact we take up the search for an ap- propriate analogy. Frankel's analogy had to do with the spinning out of Oral Torah by exegesis of Written Torah. The more recent analogies take Mishnah to be separate from the written Scripture. When it is said, "Mish- nah is a law-code," however, what is meant is, "Mishnah is like a law-code, like other law-codes." And the same is so for the analogy to the school- book. Neither analogy is suitable. The definition of what Mishnah is- what is the work as a whole-will have to await the results of inductive study of the entire document, and, at the very least, the Order of Purities. I am inclined to think Mishnah is sui generis. For when we examine other documents of the first and second centuries which deal with the same topics as are dealt with in one tractate or another, we find that the modes of thought and expression of Mishnah, quite apart from the utterly dis- tinctive substance of the laws, are entirely without analogy or parallel in other documents. Since there are no literary or cognitive parallels, there also can be no compelling analogies. Whatever Mishnah may be, as rep- resented by the tractates before us, whatever functions it is meant to serve, and whatever the purposes of those who created the law and com- piled it-these have to be discovered wholly within the limits of Mishnah itself. No court enforced the laws of cleanness, or much of the remainder</page><page sequence="5">JACOB NEUSNER 155 of Mishnah-Tosefta, after 70, so we simply do not have a law-code in the ordinary sense. People did study the laws, and that is why we have them. But for what purpose? What are we supposed to mean by "school-book" or "text-book" when we can scarcely demonstrate that there were schools for this purpose and cannot adduce evidence of other similar sorts of parallel school- or text-books? The choices under debate are inappro- priate and impoverished. The reason for the urgency of the question, what is Mishnah? is to phrase in secular terms the issue of analogies raised in mythic terms when Mishnah is made into part of Torah, the Oral Torah. That too is an analogy, an effort to define and explain the character of the strange and curious document which is the foundation of rabbinic Judaism-therefore of all Judaism from the second century. II We shall focus upon two tractates in Seder Tohorot, Kelim and Ohalot.2 The reason is that the laws of purities in Scripture are substantial and important. Further, we know that the Pharisees believed those laws were operative in ordinary life, not only in the Temple. Therefore, if any corpus of Mishnaic law is apt to rest upon a considerable heritage of exegesis of the written Scriptures, we have to choose a corpus of law for which Scrip- tures to begin with provide abundant laws. At the same time, if any corpus of Mishnaic law is apt to derive directly and immediately from the Phari- saic authorities of the period before 70 and to represent what surely is the creation of Pharisaism, it will be the laws of purities, concerning which the Pharisees held distinctive beliefs.3 My argument is that we can fairly 2. It may fairly be objected that the challenge to Frankel's notion ought to be conducted on a base larger than Kelim and Ohalot. I may say that nothing in Parah or even in Sifra to Negaim, that is, Parshiyot Nega'im and Mesora', change the picture. Frankel will find little support in Sifra's exegeses for Mishnah-Tosefta Negaim, for nearly all of them indicate knowledge of Mishnah-Tosefta Negaim; and a fair amount of Sifra cites the materials of Mishnah-Tosefta verbatim or nearly verbatim. Still, before us are forty-eight chapters of Seder Tohorot, 38% of the whole. Frankel himself held that our order is the oldest ("because it is the largest") in Mishnah. It is a good sample of the order he cited and allows a reasonable test of his supposition. But, it should be stressed, the purpose of our work is not to test old theories but to investigate the sources and their cognitive structure. 3. But the several tractates are not necessarily Pharisaic at their beginnings or even comparable to one another in origins. Kelim assuredly is Pharisaic, because only the Pharisees held that the susceptibility to uncleanness of domestic utensils, not employed in the Temple, mattered. But, as we shall observe, Ohalot turns out to be a deeply philosophical tractate, engaged in a profound inquiry into the state of the soul after death, an inquiry which, phrased in philosophical and abstract terms,</page><page sequence="6">156 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH test the twin concepts, first, that Mishnaic law is generated by the concep- tions of Scripture through exegesis, and, second, that Mishnaic law is the product of the period from Ezra to the second century, specifically by examining laws which, we can agree at the outset, relate to major corpora of Scriptural legislation. These laws are Pharisaic,4 that is, reflective of the distinctive convictions of authorities in the period of which Frankel and Briill speak. Our problem is in the history and morphology of ideas. On the one hand, we have to ask, what laws or principles lie at the very foundations of the two tractates under examination? And on the other, what concepts and fundamental ideas are contained within those laws, and how do those concepts and ideas relate to the written Scriptures? We shall answer these questions by asking, what is the verifiable datum, the absolute, minimum given, underlying the earliest assigned or attributed sayings in a given tractate of Mishnah? If we can trace the ideas and conceptions of Mish- nah from the time of Rabbi backward to Usha, and from the time of the Ushan authorities, for instance, Meir, Judah, Simeon, and Yose, back- ward to the Yavneh rabbis, for instance, Aqiva, Gamaliel, Eliezer, and Joshua, and if we further can discern that rulings assigned to those earliest named masters rely upon conceptions never under dispute and always taken for granted in all rulings, then I believe we have gone as far back as we are able in the analysis of the history of Mishnaic laws after 70.5 Since, it is generally assumed, the Houses of Shammai and Hillel come before the destruction of the Second Temple, we may further will not have proved alien to Hellenistic philosophy. Even its very title, "Tents," evokes a simile much used by the New Testament writers, in particular Paul and the author of Hebrews. So Ohalot need not lead us deep into the circles of pre-70 Pharisaism. Negaim is a quintessentially "rabbinic" tractate, beginning in the thought of Aqiva, though based upon a rich antecedent corpus of (probably Priestly) study of the laws of Leviticus 13-14. Parah is Pharisaic in its supposition that we create a realm of cleanness outside of the Temple, that is, the place in which the red cow is burned, but its subject-matter, the burning of the red cow, is not necessarily of interest to Pharisees only. We know that the Samaritans burned red cows and used their ashes for many centuries after the destruction of the Temple in 70 (which meant nothing to them anyhow), and we may assume that Temple priests had some interest in Numbers 19:1-20. Accordingly, the four tractates on which the work is done are hardly comparable to one another, and only Kelim is to be assigned, from its very beginnings, to Pharisaic thinkers. 4. Only within the qualification of the preceding note. 5. But what we claim to uncover is the history of the ideas of interrelated and correlative pericopae, not of the exact formulation of those ideas in the very words before us. A vast amount of restatement of pericopae of Yavneh went on at Usha,</page><page sequence="7">JACOB NEUSNER 157 ask, What are the givens of legal problems and disputes even in the period of the Houses? In stating matters thus, I report the result of my inquiry into the history of the Mishnaic law of purities, which has shown that there is a fairly orderly sequence or progression of legal and conceptual principles, one built upon the last, from the time of the Houses and the earlier authorities of Yavneh up to the time of the Mishnah. One generation does depend upon and make use of the legal conceptions of the previous one." Accord- ingly, we can trace the history of the Mishnaic law backward to the earliest named authorities and then, with remarkably little speculation, state with some precision the fundamental principles upon which the entire structure of Mishnaic law is built. True, we shall not then know where or how these fundamental principles originated. But we can, at the very least, test the allegation that Mishnah-Torah shebe'al peh-begins in the exegesis of Torah shebikhtav. III Let us begin with Kelim and ask, What is the absolute and minimum given of the entire tractate? The pre-history of the Mishnaic law of Kelim begins with the assumption that the status as to uncleanness of utensils outside of the cult does matter, is consequential. That is, extra-cultic utensils have to be kept clean for any purpose whatever. If we have no reason to consider the status of the utensils as to cleanness, we also have no cause to begin with to investigate whether they are susceptible to uncleanness or insusceptible to uncleanness. Since only the Pharisees, among those known to us, thought someone who was not a priest had to keep pure outside of the cult (the Essene community at Qumran is a spe- and I think still more of the formulation of Mishnah was done by Rabbi. The distinction between verbal formulation and cognitive content of pericopae should be kept in mind throughout. In my earlier volumes, I-V, I did not sufficiently stress this distinction. 6. To be sure, not all Yavnean rules are taken up and developed at Usha, and some pericopae attributed to Ushans deal with subjects simply not touched by pericopae assigned to Yavneans. We have therefore, to distinguish reliable attribu- tions of historical sequences, those in which a primitive idea is attributed to an earlier authority, and a development of that idea and a refinement of its details are assigned to a later one, from merely probable assignments of those pericopae which do not stand in logical sequence to others, either earlier or later. But it is pleasant to report that most laws of Mishnah do exhibit such a correlation of developments of logic with chronological sequences of attributions, and so our history of legal ideas is upon firm grounds.</page><page sequence="8">158 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH cial case),' we need not doubt that the fundamental conception of Kelim is part of the primary structure of Pharisaism. The laws of Kelim do not begin before Pharisaism in the formulation given it by lay people pre- tending to be priests. The one specific concept characteristic of the Mishnaic law of Kelim, beginning to end, is that a utensil which is susceptible to uncleanness is one which is whole, complete, useful-normal. That notion is to be dis- covered in Scripture. Leviticus 11:33 tells us that to clean an unclean utensil, one has to break it, make it useless. Then a utensil which can become unclean is one which is not broken, which is useful. The same exegete can have understood a utensil-a KLY-to be defined in the same place, "Every KLY made of any material" refers to anything at all; "any KLY used for any purpose" limits the foregoing to useful objects only. Autonomy, and distinctiveness follow in the wake of purpose. A second important early concept is that utensils are regarded as divided into their inside or inner part and their outside or outer part.8 The first implication of that division is that something which has a "midst" or an inner part or a receptacle is susceptible to uncleanness, and some- thing which does not-which is flat-is insusceptible. Leviticus 11:33 readily generated that concept. To be sure, that Scripture in the first place need not have brought the idea into mind. The importance of a receptacle in containing uncleanness may have derived from the larger notion of uncleanness. If one conceived uncleanness as a kind of gas of heavy viscosity, which will flow every which way unless it is contained within some receptacle-a utensil or a Tent-but which then will be kept in that one place, then the importance of the receptacle depends not upon Leviticus 11:33 but upon a quite separate conception of the material qualities of uncleanness. Accordingly, the first major development in the formation of the law of the susceptibility of domestic utensils stressed two points, (1) usefulness as the definitive criterion of what is a utensil which can be made unclean, and (2) the presence of a receptacle as the requisite for the containment of uncleanness. Other early rules or con- ceptions cannot be so readily formulated. 7. I have found no rules, e.g., in CD, relevant to Kelim. On this subject, see now L. Schiffman, The Halakhah at Qumran (Leiden, 1975). 8. See my "First Cleanse the Inside," New Testament Studies, March 1976. I try to show that the Hillelite view, that the condition of the inside of the cup determines the status of the whole cup, is later than the Shammaite view on the same matter, and that the stories in the Gospels on the matter presuppose that the status of the inside has no affect upon the status of the outside, the Shammaite view.</page><page sequence="9">JACOB NEUSNER 159 If we stand back from this first stage and ask what the Written Torah has contributed to the Oral Torah, the question may be simply answered. The Written Torah has said that those things which break the natural rhythm of life are unclean. The Oral Torah has said that those things which, among all objects, serve, or are part of, the normal course of life are susceptible to becoming unclean. The abnormal affects what is normal. Our firm result is that the laws of Kelim could have begun their develop- ment at any point, from the redaction of Leviticus onward, at which some- one opened the pertinent Scriptures and decided to apply them to utensils not involved in the cult, part of a larger intention to keep purity laws outside the Temple. No considerable exegesis was then required to demon- strate that the Torah required pretty much what the authorities before 70 and immediately afterward took at face value. While, as I said, the laws of Kelim could have begun their development any time from the comple- tion of Leviticus to the first century, the greatest probability is that the laws of Kelim began their development shortly before the time of the Houses. It is only then that the traces of a secondary exegetical tradition are to be found, resting on something more complex than the simple and plain meaning of the Scriptures themselves. The fundamental theory of Kelim thus is that what is normal and useful is susceptible to uncleanness. What is abnormal or useless is in- susceptible. So susceptibility is to the unusual and abnormal, which are represented by the sources of uncleanness-things which are out of the ordinary and regarded (for whatever reasons) as distasteful. These ab- normal things affect their very opposite, things which are commonplace. To put it differently, the negative-the out-of-the-ordinary and dishar- monious-affects the positive, the whole and complete, but not the negative. Accordingly, for Kelim we may describe the relationship of Torah shebe'al peh to Torah shebikhtav as follows: Kelim in Scripture tells us about the negative; Kelim in Mishnah describes the positive. Without Mishnah the Priestly Code describes only part of reality. Mishnah therefore completes the partial conceptions of Leviticus. And, a second major innovation in Kelim: while Scripture speaks of the cult, Mishnah speaks of the world outside the Temple. Scripture addresses itself to the realm of the sacred, Mishnah, to the world and to the secular reality outside the cult. Just as Scripture tells what must not affect the cult, so Mishnah tells us what does affect ordinary things.</page><page sequence="10">160 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH IV The relationship between Mishnah-treatise Ohalot and Numbers 19:11- 21 is completely different from that between Mishnah-treatise Kelim and Leviticus 11:33ff. Before briefly outlining the history of the laws of Ohalot, let me focus upon what is the crucial issue. What is the conception of a Tent characteristic of Mishnaic law? If we list the most profound presup- positions of Ohalot, held by the earliest named authorities, we find the following: (1) a Tent requires egress. This, logically and concomitantly, links to (2) the sealed tomb. But that presupposition should not obscure the conception upon which these statements, in their turn, depend. Corpse- uncleanness passes through a squared handbreadth of open space. Its passage may be prevented, therefore, by a minimum of a handbreadth of closed space. The entire tractate of Ohalot is founded upon a single conception, to which we may refer, for the sake of convenience, as the standard measure. And what imposes that "measure" is the trait of corpse- uncleanness. Everything else in one way or another is logically spun out of that single, fundamental trait of that which exudes from the corpse. In no way is that concept related to Scripture. No exegete even tried to find Scriptural foundations for it. And, as we recognize, what is at issue is not merely the measurement of a handbreadth, but all which is expressed by that simple measurement. For what the "handbreadth in breadth, depth, and height" means is that the Scriptural tent, a place where people actually live, has been left far behind us. The Tent as conceived by the Oral Torah, culminating in Mishnah, is anything but a place in which people dwell. So, while Sifr6 Numbers seems to preserve important exegeses which originate before the earliest laws of Mishnah-Tosefta Ohalot," it contains no hint that that tradition begins with the exegesis of Scripture, the discovery in the Written Torah of the foundations of our tractate. We have the Talmud's own statement to the same effect: little Scripture, many laws. What, then, is the conception of Tent laid out in the Oral Torah? The Written Torah speaks of a tent or a house in which people, whole and healthy in body and soul, live. The Oral Torah speaks of a Tent capable of containing that which exudes from the body at the moment of 9. That is to say, some exegeses in Sifr6 Numbers raise questions logically prior to the suppositions of anything in Mishnah-Tosefta, and the latter document builds upon the results of those exegeses. In substance, therefore, the exegeses in a few instances seem to come before the law of Mishnah-Tosefta.</page><page sequence="11">JACOB NEUSNER 161 death, a Tent which takes the place of the body. It goes without saying that the laws of Numbers 19:11ff. were not understood in this way by others who make reference to them. What therefore has the Oral Torah contributed? On the surface, we have nothing more than a useful definition, a filling out of the Scriptural law with some necessary additional information. What is this tent, re- ferred to in Numbers 19:11? It is simply an enclosed space of a certain dimension. And what is that dimension? A handbreadth of enclosed space. If this were the primary conceptual contribution of Mishnah, then our notion of the Oral Torah should be stated as follows: The role of Oral Torah-of Mishnah-is to fill in some unimportant gaps in Scrip- tural law, to supply some needed definitions. But a closer look at the basis of Mishnah's contribution requires a revision of our conception of the Oral Torah. For that squared hand- breadth, which is at the foundation of everything else, is nothing other than a brief and elliptical way of referring to the space through which the contaminating effects of the corpse will make their way. We observe time and again that "a corpse is assumed to pass through four hand- breadths, its contaminating effects through one." When, therefore, we define a Tent as a handbreadth in height, breadth, and depth, what have we said? We have defined a Tent not as a house or a building in which people can live or even in which a corpse will fit. We have defined a Tent as the space occupied by the gaseous effusion of the corpse. This self- evidently has nothing to do with the house or building which people see and use. It has much, I think, to do with the house or building in which the person has existed, the body. More explicitly: when we say a Tent must measure a handbreadth, either to prevent uncleanness from entering its enclosed space, or to keep uncleanness within its enclosed space (without regard to the nature of the enclosure-walls or no walls), what is the meaning of such an alle- gation? What is this Tent to which reference is made in Ohalot? (Even if we substitute house for Tent, when house is used in Ohalot, the referent at some point seems to be burial niche, kokh, as much as a real house.) And what is it that can be contained in the Tent of which Ohalot speaks? The answer is not the body, for a whole body by definition is four times larger than a handbreadth, and therefore a body cannot be contained in a Tent. The terms of the answer, moreover, have to include that invisible viscous gas which is uncleanness, because it is everywhere taken for</page><page sequence="12">162 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH granted that uncleanness cannot penetrate a closed area of a handbreadth or less, on the one hand, or will be prevented from exuding by that same closed area, if it is enclosed by it. Corpse-uncleanness is something which can be contained by a Tent. A Tent is something which can contain or interpose against corpse-un- cleanness. The one has-in the nature of things-to be defined in terms of the other. Our definition of a Tent is curiously out of phase with the simple meaning of Scripture. The issue of Scripture is drastically revised, indeed, when Tent becomes "that which can contain what exudes from a corpse." When, therefore, we define Tent as we do here, and as is taken for granted throughout the Mishnaic laws which depend upon the simple definition before us, we mean something entirely different from what Scripture means. If the conception of death is that when a person dies, something leaves, exudes from, the body, then the Tent serves as the functional equivalent to the body, for it is able to receive and contain that which exudes from the body. The Tent, therefore, takes the place of the body, makes a place for that which, in the body, leaves at the point or moment of death. The Tent is to be understood as a surrogate for the body, restoring the order which has broken with the exit from the body, of that which exudes from it. Death has released this effusion. The Tent then contains it. We have avoided naming this thing which "exudes from the corpse at such a vis- cosity as to pass through an open space of a handbreadth or more, but no less." I see no point in calling it the soul and to allege that the "un- cleanness" of the corpse is the "soul" which is the "spirit" surviving after death and requiring a new locale. (Simeon b. Gamaliel does refer to corpse-uncleanness as tum'at hanefesh, Tosefta to Mishnah Ohalot 11:1.) Philo seems to have had just such a notion: Further, too, those who enter a house in which anyone has died are ordered not to touch anything until they have bathed themselves and also washed the clothes which they were wearing. And all the vessels and articles of furniture, and anything else that happens to be inside, practically everything is held by him to be unclean. For a man's soul is a precious thing, and when it departs to seek another home, all that will be left behind is defiled, deprived as it is of the divine image. For it is the mind of man which has the form of God,</page><page sequence="13">JACOB NEUSNER 163 being shaped in conformity with the ideal archetype, the Word that is above all. Special Laws 3:206-207 (Trans. F. H. Colson, p. 605) Neither Kelim nor Ohalot begins in the Priestly Code. Neither tractate develops the lines laid out therein. Indeed, the most fundamental con- victions of both tractates lie wholly outside of Scripture. For Kelim the issue is the susceptibility and insusceptibility to impurity of various non- cultic utensils. For Ohalot the issue is the nature and functioning of Tents (and utensils). Scriptural law knows little of either issue. The Mishnaic conception that we must ask about the susceptibility of one object as against that of another is utterly alien to those few references to Scripture which are even relevant to the laws of Kelim. The question, what is a Tent? would be ludicrous to the authority behind Numbers 19:11-22, for he takes for granted that a Tent is a tent.'0 Proof of the irrelevance of Scripture to the two Mishnaic tractates is contained in the exegetical compilations which purport to link the Oral Torah to the wholly Written one. Sifra has virtually nothing which, in conception, let alone in articulation, does not depend upon Mishnah- Tosefta as completed compilations. Sifr6 Numbers does have exegeses which clearly seem in conception prior to, and in formulation autonomous from, anything in Mishnah. But these accomplish virtually nothing in linking Scripture to the underlying conceptions of the Tent (which are far, far earlier than our tractate's inquiry). And even if, for both tractates, we had considerably richer collections of exegesis, we could hardly claim 10. In point of fact, Mishnah-Tosefta contains two distinct conceptions of a Tent. One is formal. A tent interposes against uncleanness if it is of a certain size and shape. The other is functional. A tent is formed by any substance which is insus- ceptible to, therefore can prevent the passage of, corpse-uncleanness. The two names of the tractate, Ohalot for Mishnah, Ahilot for Tosefta, preserve these two distinct conceptions, ohalot, the substantive, treats that which bears the shape and form of the tent, and ahilot refers to that which functions to overshadow. Interestingly, Ushan thought on the nature of the utensil also is divided among two groups, one which defines a utensil in terms of materials, the other in terms of the function and shape of a utensil-that which can serve as a container or receptacle. Those interested in form, in both Kelim and Ohalot, are not interested in materials and their sus- ceptibility; those interested in function, in both tractates, stress the susceptibility of materials. In Kelim I think both groups can find in sayings of Aqiva support of their respective philosophies. In Ohalot it is difficult to find Yavnean sources for the Ushan conceptions. Aqiva, for his part, sees the Tent not as passive and formal but as active, something which unites discrete bits of corpse-matter within its shadow and draws together and makes affective their contaminating potentialities.</page><page sequence="14">164 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH that many specific laws have been worked out in response to the exegesis (let alone eisegesis) of the Scriptures. The contrary is the case. Perhaps the exegetes took for granted that the bed-rock convictions of the laws also were assumed by the Scriptures. But they still have not shown us where, in Scripture, they locate those laws or principles, and I think the probable explanation is that they could not (and did not care to). That is why they remind us that Ohalot has much law but little Scripture. When, therefore, we refer to Scripture in seeking the beginnings, the pre-Mishnaic history, of Mishnaic law, we commit an error of gross anachronism. To put it very simply: Kelim begins somewhere, but not in Leviticus. At some stage in its early history, however, the sages who formed the law responded to such verses in Leviticus as seemed relevant to it, though the law's datum, its basic assumption, comes before the inquiry into Scripture. The problem of Ohalot, of course, is somewhat different, for the appended tractates, fore and aft, Mishnah Ohalot 1:1- 3:5, Mishnah Ohalot 16:3-18:10, do little more than add some clarifi- cations and explications to what Scripture tells us about corpse-con- tamination and modes by which corpse-contamination is conveyed. Yet the Tents, meaning the processes of overshadowing, of which Ohalot speaks, bear no relationship whatever to the tent, the real tent, in which a person has died, mentioned by Numbers 19:11, 14-16, etc. We have, consequently, to address ourselves first to what is everywhere taken for granted, and only second to what is found pertinent in the Priestly Code to that datum of the law, its primary conception. V Implicit in the contents and concept of Oral Torah therefore is the notion of the independence and autonomy of that Oral Torah. If, as I have suggested, the Mishnaic law is separate from, and autonomous of Scripture, though in its unfolding it is made to interrelate, where it can, to Scripture, then we must wonder whether we have not simply stated in historical language what the ancient rabbis meant in speaking, to begin with, of two Torahs, one in writing, the other transmitted orally. It cer- tainly is a drastic misstatement of the facts to see these two Torahs as interrelated in their beginnings, so far as the pertinent and reciprocally relevant segments of Leviticus and Numbers, Kelim and Ohalot, are concerned. It is an accurate statement of the facts as they were in the third century to regard Leviticus and Numbers as one Torah, Kelim and</page><page sequence="15">JACOB NEUSNER 165 Ohalot as another, separate but correlative, one. The authorities of Mish- nah-Tosefta do not derive their laws from Scriptures. On occasion they do twist Scriptures to make them fit preconceived conclusions. The im- plicit question of the exegetical compilations on the law is, "How do we know X from the Torah," with X the given law or belief. The problem is, then, to justify it from Scripture, not to find out what Scripture teaches about that subject. If we started with Scripture and asked what it taught, we should never, never discover even the simplest datum of rabbinic law. When we start with the answers-the rabbinic law-and ask how Scrip- ture can be made to justify that law, the answers are anything but per- spicuous. That the authorities of Mishnah-Tosefta understood these facts full well seems strongly implied by their conception of two Torahs, one written, the other oral. Having carefully distinguished Mishnaic from Pentateuchal concep- tions in respect to utensils and Tents, Kelim and Ohalot, we now see that there is virtually no fundamental and reciprocal relationship whatever. True, as I said, a few verses in Leviticus prove not only relevant to Kelim but also formative of elements in the basic stratum of laws, and the same seems so for Numbers and Ohalot. But the generative concept, the mytho- poeic event or force, from which the Mishnaic tractates emerge is not Scripture, precisely as the rabbis of the second and later centuries claim, but an entirely separate "Torah"-"revelation" in theological language. We have, therefore, to ask about the relationships between the two "Torahs," Scripture and Mishnah, just as did the third-century exegetes who stand behind much of Sifra and Sifr6. We eliminate one theoretical relationship at the outset: the historical and exegetical relationship. Be- cause of their utter disparity, I cannot see how the two Torahs relate in some causal and sequential way, the written one first, which then origi- nates or generates the oral one. And, it follows, exegesis of the Written Torah, the Pentateuch, did not create, and does not stand behind, the fundamental conceptions of the Oral one, the Mishnah, although once those primal conceptions were in being, the Pentateuch obviously would shape their articulation.1x 11. Since this is so obvious, I am at a loss to explain why Frankel came to such a conclusion and why so many thereafter persisted in it. I look in vain for a twentieth- century scholarly account of "Oral Torah," whether in encyclopedias or in more sustained studies, which does not tell us about how "the rabbis" from Ezra to the first century spun out through the exegesis of Scriptures the laws now found in Mishnah. The explanations of why we have no evidence that such "rabbis" existed</page><page sequence="16">166 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH The sole reciprocal relationship we can describe, therefore, is concep- tual, or, in a loose sense of the word, metaphysical. And here the rela- tionship is amazingly close. The two Torahs complement one another, are necessary to one another, balance and complete the conceptions of one another. The world-view of the one invites and instigates the reflections which lay the foundations of the other.12 Specifically, in the case of Kelim, we noticed that the sources of un- cleanness specified in Scripture are things which break the natural and normal course of life, the unusual or the abnormal (or, that which was perceived in remote times of antiquity to be unnatural or abnormal). Objects which are abnormal or useless are not affected by these processes. Susceptible to the unusual and abnormal are things which are common- place, normal, everyday, and useful. The negative, the out-of-the-ordinary and disharmonious, affects the positive, that which is whole and complete. There is a striking correspondence between the priestly conception, in Leviticus, of the sources of uncleanness and the Mishnaic conception, in Kelim, of objects susceptible to the uncleanness imparted by those sources. are diverse and very imaginative. And a further curiosity in the intellectual history of modern Jewish scholarship is why the name of Sherira Gaon, who originally proposed the theory of the exegetical foundation of Mishnah, is mentioned only uncommonly. I recommend, as by far the best account of the established theory, Jacob Z. Lauterbach, "Midrash and Mishnah" in his Rabbinic Essays, edited by Lou H. Silberman (Cincinnati, 1951), pp. 163-258. Lauterbach does credit Sherira (p. 166, n. 4). He himself states, "Modern scholars have . . . recognized it as an established historic fact that the Midrash was originally the exclusive form in which all teachings of the Halakah were given." "Mishnah-form is of a much later date" (p. 167). I think that, standing by itself, that statement is valid. We have ample evi- dence of various types of exegesis of Scripture-none of it "rabbinic," to be sure- in the period before 70, while what Lauterbach calls Mishnah-form is not apt to derive much earlier than the middle of the first century A.D. The rabbinic traditions about the Pharisees, for example, do not even allege that that form pertains to say- ings of authorities before Shammai and Hillel, who are the first to be given an ample corpus of materials in standard attributive form (X says . . .) for instance, not to mention in the form of disputes (Statement of problem, X says... Y says...). But, it is clear, the issue is not whether there were exegeses, nor whether these exegeses are preserved in forms given them before 70. The issue is the origins of the fundamental conceptions of the "Oral Torah" now contained in Mishnah. Since the exegetical compilations alleged to contain the beginnings of the Oral Torah make no pretense of proving the most basic convictions of the Oral Torah, so far as our tractates are concerned, it is difficult to find much evidence in favor of the theory that those conceptions begin in exegesis. But, it is to be stressed, that is simply beside the point. 12. But, I repeat, this is a post facto judgment, not a claim as to the generative force behind our tractate.</page><page sequence="17">JACOB NEUSNER 167 For Ohalot, we may discern parallel correspondences. When someone dies, a change affects the economy of nature. The body which has housed the person lies lifeless. Scripture is clear that that body produces "un- cleanness," specifying the various ways in which the uncleanness is trans- ferred and the things affected by it. (This imbalance specified by Scripture uses the language "uncleanness" to refer to that which has taken place, and we do not have to diverge from that language.) What then happens to the uncleanness released from the body? Where does it go? What is it? The Oral Torah's answer, suggested above, is that that uncleanness now will find a new container, something which will keep and contain it as the body has done. What will do so? Something a handbreadth in height, breadth, and depth, with adequate entry (thus: egress) for the effusion of the corpse to find a way in. This new "house," the Tent, takes the place of the old, the body, thus restoring the natural economy and order. It may be envisioned as a "house"/Tent, or it may be seen as something far more abstract, simply as that which will prevent the pas- sage of uncleanness, keeping it in ("bringing the uncleanness") or pre- venting its entry ("interposing against the uncleanness"). The two processes, interposition or containment, are one and the same thing. The point of interest of the Oral Torah, therefore, is in righting the imbalance specified by the written one, in explaining how the whole, complete order or economy-the whole house-of reality is to be conceived. The Written Torah tells about the unbalancing, the Oral Torah records the restoration of the wholeness and completeness, the order and perfect form, of reality. This is so for both Kelim and Ohalot. I therefore affirm the view of Mary Douglas, who sees the total structure of purity laws as a "symbolic system." 13 She says, "A symbolic system consists of rules of behavior, actions and expectations which constitute society itself. The rules which generate and sustain society allow meanings to be realized which otherwise would be undefined and ungraspable .. In the case of the Bible, purity and impurity are the dominant contrastive categories leading to holiness. As in any social system, these rules are specifications which draw analogies between states. The cumulative power of the analogies enables one situation to be matched to another, related by equivalence, negation, hierarchy and inclusion . . . The purity rules of the Bible . . . set up the great inclusive categories in which the whole uni- verse is hierarchized and structured. Access to their meaning comes by 13. Stated in my Idea of Purity in Ancient Judaism (Leiden, 1974), pp. 138ff.</page><page sequence="18">168 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH mapping the same basic set of rules from one context to another." Douglas argues that each set of purity rules matches the next: "In this exercise the classification of animals into clean and unclean, the classification of peoples as pure and common, the contrast of blemished to unblemished in the attributes of sacrificial victim, priest and woman, create in the Bible an entirely consistent set of criteria and values. The table, the marriage bed, and the altar match each others' rules, as do the farmer, the husband and the priest match each others' roles in the total pattern ..." Unintentionally, and in a very circuitous way, I have found the rela- tionship between the conceptions of purity, the respective articulations of the rules, of the Written and the Oral Torahs, to supply an apt illustration of Douglas's proposition. She has argued that the purity laws are a set of expressions, in discrete materials, of a single set of cogent and coherent categories, each parallel to the next, all necessary for a complete, whole conception of reality. In much the same way, the two Torahs, Written and Oral, create an entirely cogent and consistent set of conceptions. If we had one without the other, our structure (our "metaphysics") should be partial and incomplete. We can say what constitutes the incompleteness of the one Torah without the other, just as Douglas can say what consti- tutes the uncleanness of the unclean animals and the cleanness of the clean. Just as she has told us about a whole symbolic system, so we have been able to discern elements in a vast expansion and completion of that same whole symbolic system, though only through discerning what must be a very tiny part of the metaphysic. Yet that is not the whole story. Clearly, the people who stand behind those segments of the metaphysic we discover in Kelim and Ohalot (and expect to see elsewhere) have done a great deal of selection. Why, after all, should a handful of verses in Leviticus have produced so vast a trac- tate as Kelim? The uncomplicated picture of Numbers 19:11ff. has been made to yield the extraordinarily complex laws of Ohalot. So what has been selected is not merely the Scriptural themes. Someone at some point has seen as terribly important what Scripture at best alludes to, and then not in a conceptual framework remotely resembling what is before us in Oral Torah. A world-view is contained within the laws of the Oral Torah. As I said, that world-view not only corresponds to, but also complements and completes, the conceptions, such as they are, of the Written Torah. Yet the disproportions, the disequilibrium are such as to prevent our claiming anything like balance and correspondence. Two massive and all-encompassing conceptions of reality-the one</page><page sequence="19">JACOB NEUSNER 169 now in the Priestly Code, the other far in the background of Mishnaic law-existed, each with its distinctive areas of emphasis, special obses- sions, deep concerns. These are seen by us to be complementary, but this is only after the fact. To begin with, they were not. Why not? Because to the Priestly legislator, what is in the center of things is the cult. Utensils made unclean are not used in the cult. That is nearly the whole story, and a very minor story at that. In like manner, the person made unclean by a corpse cannot enter the cult. The predicate expressing the ultimate value in both cases is cultic. For the Oral Torah, by contrast, the obsession is not with the cult, which rarely explicitly occurs, but with the fact of cleanness or uncleanness itself. Uncleanness affects pots or houses, is contained or released, creeps through windows and doors or is kept out. The laws before us see cleanness and uncleanness not as contingent, de- pendent upon the cult for their importance, but as important in and of themselves. That does not mean that for the Priestly legislator uncleanness was relative and not absolute, immaterial and not material. To him it was very real. But its importance-not its reality-depended upon the cult. For the Mishnah, by contrast, at times uncleanness may seem relative and immaterial, e.g., dependent upon a person's intention or conception of usefulness or upon time and circumstance. But uncleanness always is a given, a datum, assumed to affect all of one's affairs, not solely the cult or equivalent cultic activities. The Priestly legislator homogenizes all sorts and sources of "uncleanness" within a single term, tum'ah. The Mishnaic legislators differentiate that simple "uncleanness," assigning to it a rich vocabulary of highly articulated and definitive words.'4 Working with the same themes, and, I think, working partly with the inherited materials of Scripture, the mind behind Mishnaic law has given us something quite different from those Scriptural materials. What is it? It is the picture of the relevance and importance of uncleanness as it must have existed before the Priestly lawyers took all modes and forms of uncleanness and turned them into a single cultic concern. In Mishnah, as in the time before the Priestly Code, uncleanness is everywhere con- 14. I wholly accept the arguments of Baruch A. Levine, In the Presence of the Lord. Aspects of Ritual in Ancient Israel (Leiden, 1974) in behalf of the view that cleanness and uncleanness were not relative but material and palpable realities: "Underlying the priestly regulations relevant to the purity of the sanctuary was a demonic conception of sin, offense, and transgression." The contrary view, put forward by W. Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites (1889, repr. New York, 1956) and copied by Y. Kaufmann, seems to me decisively refuted by Levine.</page><page sequence="20">170 MEANING OF TORAH SHEBE'AL PEH sequential, not merely in the cult. It is highly differentiated both as to causes and as to effects. Mishnaic law seems, therefore, to carry us back to the situation prevailing before the Priestly reformulation of purity. It not merely complements Scripture but reverses and revises Scripture's basic assumptions. I hasten to stress that in claiming our tractates give us the picture of the relevance and importance of uncleanness as these were understood before the compilation of the Priestly Code, in no way do I offer an historical statement, but rather, a phenomenological one. That is, we see clearly in P that the priestly lawyers have taken over a vast and differen- tiated variety of taboos and made all of them focus upon the Temple, even though, to begin with, many of them can have had little if anything to do with the cult in particular. The Pharisaic lawyers differentiate what was homogenized, as I said, and at the same time claim that cleanness and uncleanness are concerns of the home, the table, the bed, and much else, and not solely, or primarily, important in the cult. Accordingly, we may say that the traits of the Pharisaic and later rabbinic thought on cleanness and the supposition of the torahs of cleanness compiled and revised by the priestly writers of P are diametrically opposed, and that the priests of Leviticus and Numbers revised and rejected conceptions of the locus and meaning of uncleanness in no way alien, in principle, to those of the Pharisees and later rabbis. So far as the second and third century rabbis were concerned, however, both Torahs, written and oral, came down from Sinai as one whole Torah. In a strange way we must now agree that the Oral Torah, contained in Mishnah-Tosefta, not only corresponds to but completes the Written Torah. The Oral Torah returns us to the conceptual world prevailing long before that time, restoring what was reformed by Leviticus. Perhaps a certain logic, inherent in the subject matter, dictated that there should have to be two Torahs, the written one for the cult, the oral, other one for the world outside the cult, one for the place of the holy, the other for the realm of the ordinary and profane. If indeed there is such an inherent logic, then it is that which we may conclude-to speak in the language of rabbinic myth-was truly revealed to Moses at Sinai, one whole Torah indeed, completing the sacred with the profane.'5 15.
