<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Goulder. The Prayers of David (Psalms 51-72): Studies in the Psalter II. Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Supplement Series 102. Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1990. 266 pp. The book under review is the second in Michael Goulder's projected three-volume Studies in the Psalter Goulder considers the collection in which the psalms are gathered and the order in which they stand as the keys to their interpretation. In The Psalms of the Sons of Korah (Sheffield, 1982) he studied the collection of psalms carrying in their superscription the designation libne qorah (Pss. 42-49, 84-85, 87-88). The present volume examines the collection, "The Prayers of David" (Pss. 51-72), and the final volume will address "The Psalms of Asaph" (Pss. 50, 73-83). In chapter 1, Goulder clearly announces his hypotheses (pp. 24-25): (1) "The Prayers" were written "for David" by a court poet, a priest, and close attendant during David's lifetime; and (2) the prayers are a response to the events in the final years of the king's life arranged chronologically and sequentially from the death of Uriah (Ps. 51) to the succession of Solomon (Ps. 72). In the same chapter, Goulder also defines and delimits his study of "The Prayers of David." The postscript at Psalm 72:20 reads, "The Prayers of David, son of Jesse, are ended." Where, however, do they begin, and what characterizes the grouping?, asks Goulder. Is it merely the appearance of "David" in the superscription to several psalms that marks the prayers? All but four of the psalms in Book I of the Psalter (Pss. 1-41) also carry David's name. Are all the psalms in Book I and II, therefore, "The Prayers of David"? Goulder identifies "The Prayers" as a distinct collection beginning with Psalm 51 and going through to Psalm 72. The overwhelming preference for YHWH over Elohim in Book I and the reverse in Book II sharply distinguish the two books, as does the statement of division of the books after Psalm 41. These</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 297 distinctions permit Goulder to separate the psalms of Book I from those of Book II. Book II opens with a series of psalms "of the Sons of Korah" (42, 44-49) and a "psalm of Asaph" (50). Goulder rejects taking the collection of "The Prayers of David" as beginning with the first psalm of Book II (42), since this would involve an insertion of Korah and Asaph psalms into "The Prayers of David." Beginning with Psalm 51, however, and continuing to the end of Book II, which is identical with the end of "The Prayers of David," we have a grouping consisting mainly of David psalms. Only Psalms 66, 67, 71, and 72 do not carry l&amp;dawtd in the superscription. Goulder, nevertheless, takes these also as belonging in the collection from the beginning. On the basis of his lexical and thematic treatment, Goulder demonstrates that Psalms 66, 67, and 71 exhibit a content and tone consistent with their immediate context. He furthermore points to Greek evidence for a David superscription to Psalms 67 and 71. Moreover, he argues, consistent with many Hebrew manuscripts, that Psalm 71 is a continuation of Psalm 70. As to the final psalm of the collection (72), which bears the name s'ell6mdh and not dawtd, Goulder understands this prayer as having been composed for the accession of Solomon to the throne, an event that took place during David's lifetime, close to David's death. In chapter 2, Goulder reviews the 2 Samuel-i Kings Succession Narrative, suggesting that only in the light of such a narrative can "The Prayers" be understood. Penitence and atonement for the sins of the preceding year was an important theme in the Israelite autumn festival. The story of David's troubles supplies the myth to accompany the people's liturgy. The ceremony, posits Goulder, recapitulated the sufferings of David, whom God chose to be the founder of a perpetual dynasty. "David sinned, and in his trials atoned for his sin, and so brought in an age of peace and prosperity: we re-enact his trials, in hope to atone for our sins and to bring in a happier time," suggests Goulder (p. 48). The remainder of the book is given to a close exposition of Psalms 51-72. In his exegesis, Goulder insightfully and convincingly argues his case. Goulder regards the technical terms in Psalms, topographical notes and musical notes, and the sequence of the prayers as supporting the thematic evidence that "our psalmist put into David's mouth suitable words of penitence for his ill deeds [in the death of Uriah] in 51; he expressed the king's anguish through the hard days of the retreat and his triumph after battle in 52-68; he wrote two long laments for the revolts of Sheba (69) and Adonijah (70-71); and here [72] is his psalm of hope for the young Solomon" (p. 246).</page><page sequence="3">298 BOOK REVIEWS Goulder treats other commentaries in an able and evenhanded manner. Even those works which do not support his thesis are cited fairly and refuted effectively. Anyone interested in the psalms, their provenance, and their application would do well to study this work.
