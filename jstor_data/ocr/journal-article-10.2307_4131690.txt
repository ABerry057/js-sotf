<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Golomb. Nietzsche and Zion. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004. xii, 274 pp. The history of "reader response" to Nietzsche's writings, among both his critics and his admirers, includes views that are often inconsistent with each other and contentious in themselves. In writing about Nietzsche's impact on Zionist thinkers, Jacob Golomb is especially conscious of this minefield as he con- fronts the apparent contradiction between Nietzsche's acute and harsh opposition to nationalism, German or otherwise, and Zionism's ultimate ideal of a Jewish state. ("The state," Nietzsche famously wrote, "is the coldest of all cold mon- sters.") Yet as Golomb makes clear, Nietzsche did influence the major Zionist thin- kers: Herzl, Nordau, Berdichevsky, 'Ahad Ha'am, Buber, and Hillel Zeitlin. And if the differences among these figures' views of Zionism suggests how partial their appropriations of Nietzsche's thought would be, Golomb fully demonstrates this fact itself, disclosing its effects on them even during Nietzsche's lifetime, when he was relatively unknown to the larger public. 477</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Golomb confronts the obstacles of Nietzsche's antinationalism with a com- bination of candor and qualification. The candor comes in his acknowledgement that "[t]here were in reality no Jewish [Zionist?] Nietzscheans par excellence" (15), implying that even Zionist thinkers who were influenced by Nietzsche none- theless parted company with him on certain essential points. But Golomb justifies applying the label "Nietzschean" to anyone "who at some point in his creative life admitted to having been influenced ... by Nietzsche and sought to give this influ- ence some concrete expression in his oeuvre" (4-5). This seems a narrow conception of "influence"-thinkers may, after all, refuse to admit or may even be unaware of the influences on them-but it is clear enough, and Golomb demon- strates that the figures he discusses satisfy the criterion. Certain evident and common features of Nietzsche's thought, according to Golomb, attracted these thinkers. Nietzsche himself might not have seen such fea- tures as detachable from others in his work, but this proved no more an issue for Zionist authors than for the many other groups that also appropriated Nietzsche in a piecemeal fashion, such as socialists, feminists, monarchists, fascists, Jungians, and liberal democrats. Some readers of Nietzsche have viewed him as making no systematic claims at all and so as inviting a fragmented afterlife, but Golomb is not among them. Thus, he points to elements of Nietzsche's thought that Zionists would understandably have been drawn to: the coming of a "new man" as Zionism broke with the "ghetto" Jewish past and Nietzsche's anticlericalism and secularism, which, notwithstanding the Zionist attachment to aspects of the Jewish tradition, echoed its rejection of clericalism's historical constraints on Jewish life. Above all, Nietzsche preached the value of individual authenticity--Werde wer du bist-and Zionism, although affirming a collective ideal, demanded for that realization individuals who looked inward as well as outward for a source of authority. Nietzsche was also an early and severe critic of the purportedly universalist aspirations of Enlightenment thought, and, notwith- standing its recognition of the benefits in Europe of the "Emancipation," Zionism opted even more strongly for the particularism asserted in the goal of a specifically Jewish homeland. To be sure, the figures whom Golomb focuses on differ in the parts of Nietzsche they appropriate and the interpretation they give them. Their affinity for him, moreover, almost always appears early in their careers and then diminishes (for 'Ahad Ha'am, it vanishes altogether). Herzl is arguably an exception here, perhaps because he died so young; certain Nietzschean images (for example, the charge of "slave morality") persist in his critique of European Jews, though his Nietzschean fervor (as in Der Judenstaat's proclamation, "I must demolish before I construct") weakens over time. This pattern, Golomb notes, still more egregiously marks Buber's association-beginning with an early, unpublished essay affirming Nietzsche's emphasis on individualism and self-creation that is, however, superseded by Buber's growing aversion to Nietzsche's materialism and rejection of community, as well as by Buber's increasingly pointed commitment to a specifically Jewish identity. (Buber's bina- tional political advocacy through Brit Shalom, Golomb argues, only accentuated the latter emphasis.) 478</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Golomb anticipates the problem of claiming 'Ahad Ha'am as any sort of Nietzschean but justifies the claim by pointing to 'Ahad Ha'am's interest in Berdichevsky, who took Nietzsche very seriously. Certainly, 'Ahad Ha'am's advocacy of a Jewish homeland as a "spiritual center" clashes with Nietzsche's conception of the role of ideas (or "spirit"). At other junctures as well, Golomb's claim that the Zionists were indebted to Nietzsche seems strained this surfaces in his concluding optimism on the prospect of recovering Nietzschean individual authenticity in the social context of contemporary Israel. But as the main thrust of his book demonstrates Nietzsche's presence in Zionist thinking, it moves convincingly in two directions. Most immediately, it displays the range of differences in Zionist and, to some extent, Jewish responses to modernity-a reaction with which Nietzsche allied himself in more general terms. Nietzsche thus serves as a reference point for the elaboration of Jewish thin- kers' views on what the Jewish future will or should hold, and Golomb thus advances our understanding of an important aspect of modern Jewish history through Nietzsche. The second direction is the view Golomb provides of Nietzsche as thinker. Although his own interpretation of Nietzsche becomes evident-Nietzsche as protoexistentialist, endorsing authenticity and affirming the will to Macht (power) as distinct from Kraft (force)-Golomb withholds judgment on whether the Zionist authors he discusses got Nietzsche "right" in their interpretations. His agnosticism here seems fully warranted, as it was their understanding of Nietzsche rather than what he "really" meant that determined his influence on them. Admittedly, the answer to the question of what Nietzsche's views were-specifically, for example, how he would have viewed the creation of the Jewish state that Herzl prophesied after the First Zionist Congress in 1897- cannot be based on the responses of any one group of readers, much less a group that was itself of several minds. Again, the question of whether Nietzsche asserted any doctrines at all will no doubt persist. But Golomb's book valuably contributes to the substantive issues at the root of these disagreements, showing how Nietzsche entered the divided world of interpretations of Jewish history.
