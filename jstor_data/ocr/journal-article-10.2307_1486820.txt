<plain_text><page sequence="1">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES: UNDERLYING FORMS AND ANALOGIES IN HAYYUJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS by ROGER JAY KAPLAN 0.0 Introduction This study examines Rabbi Yehuda Hayytj's (945-1000 C.E.) use of two derivational processes: underlying forms and linguistic analogies (singular: Arabic , J; Hebrew rip),' which were an integral element of his work. Since his goal was to show the derivation of Hebrew verbs from triliteral roots, he focused on weak verbs whose surface forms did not demonstrate all three radicals. He compared many weak verbs to other verbal forms in order to identify the exact inflection of words, especially their verbal pattern (Qm) and consonantal roots. HayyOj was the author of linguistic treatises in which the concept of the triliteral root in Hebrew morphology and lexicography was first proposed. This article is adapted from my dissertation on Hayyclj's works and a paper delivered at Ohio State University on February, 25, 1992. I would like to thank Michael Zwettler and Zilla Goodman for reviewing earlier versions of this article. Hayyfij = Rabbi Yehuda Hayydij, The Weak and Geminative Verbs in Hebrew, ed.

His works, all written in Judeo-Arabic, include: (1) .,S, ? j , c JiW Iv ("The Book of Verbs Containing Weak Letters"), in which he argued for the existence of the triliteral root and the phenomenon of weak radicals in the Hebrew verb system; (2) 1f 1 J3 J.i ', I  ' ("The Book of Verbs Containing [Two] Similar [Letters]"), which focuses on roots whose second and third radicals are identical; (3) 1J.J:., ~L( ("The Book of Vocalization"), in which HayyOj explained the behavior of the seven Hebrew vowels in various phonological and morphological environments;2 and (4) 1 j .:JI . ("The Book of Plucked Feathers"), which is a semi-exegetical and semi-philological analysis of select biblical passages.3 IHayyOj developed two methods to examine the derivation of weak verbs in order to identify the verbs' triliteral consonantal roots. First, he distinguished between the underlying form (deep structure) and the surface form of the verb. Typically, IHayyOj used the underlying form because it demonstrated the three radicals before they underwent any morphological or phonological changes. Second, he applied linguistic analogies to show the inflection and derivation of a verb. He employed two types of analogies. In one, he compared the verb to an analogous verb in the root 'D. Given forms were compared to analogous inflections from this root in order to distinguish which letters of the verb were radicals and which were formatives. In the second type of analogy, he compared the weak verb to a strong verb of the same inflection. The discussion of HayyOj's uses of derivational processes is organized according to the different types of underlying forms and analogies as shown in Figure 1. While each of these procedures will be detailed below with specific examples from Hayyctj's works, the focus of this paper will be on the first process, "underlying forms," and the three types of them found in Hayyoj's works: namely, unattested verbs, attested verbs, and individual radicals. 2. These three works were published as The Weak and Genzinative Verbs in Hebrew and translated into Hebrew in the Middle Ages by Moshe ha-Kohen ibn Giqatilla as ,'1Do l,?v pr'p'r, ed. John W.

First, since Hayytj was the first to propose triliteral roots for Hebrew, it is important to understand the critical methods he employed in developing his revolutionary attempt to derive weak verbs from triliteral consonantal roots.4 Second, modem scholarship's description of these methods need to be reexamined in light of a detailed analysis, a study of terminology, and a comparison to modem linguistics. The intention here is to show that Hayylj developed methods to explore verbal derivations, including underlying forms and analogies, in order to derive the consonantal roots of weak verbs and to prove his hypothesis of triliteral roots in Hebrew. Furthermore, when one 4. By "weak" verbs is meant verbal forms with absent radicals, i.e., forms in which not all three radicals appear in the surface structure; consequently, I have elected to use the terminology of "weak" and "strong" when referring to roots and verbs. Since Hebrew morphology allows for the regular transformation of weak roots, it would be improper to call their inflections "irregular." HIayytj defined weak roots as those that include among their radicals one of the letters Xt,r, 1, , . Strong roots do not include any of these letters. Hayytj also made note of other radicals, namely, 5, 2, and rn, that behave like weak letters, but the focus of his work is on the former set of consonants. See Hayytj, p. 122, 11. 10-12, and Roger Jay Kaplan, "A Critical Analysis of the Philological Methods of Yehuda ben David (Hayytj)" (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1992), pp. 156-157.</page><page sequence="4">316 ROGER JAY KAPLAN examines many underlying forms, it is revealed that simply defining the linguistic term asl as such does not adequately describe HayyOj's intentions in these particular derivations. An important aspect of this work is understanding the nature of the underlying form, which Hayytj identified by the Arabic linguistic term asl. Hayytj never specifically defined asl, but from the contextual usage of the term, his intentions are evident. In his writings, asl means three things: (1) consonantal root (used 278 times; 36 percent of the time) (2) an individual radical (used 25 times; 3.2 percent of the time), and (3) the underlying form (of a verb or radical) (used 470 times; 60.8 percent of the time). Regarding the third use of the term asl, in his 1984 examination of HayyOj's terminology, cAli-Khilid translated it as "basic form" (t10' nm1y).5 The verbal forms chosen by HayyOj for these analogies, however, are not "basic forms" (i.e., minimally inflected forms of the verb), nor are they necessarily "stems," but rather, many are underlying forms or deep structures of the verb. In order to prove the derivation of verbs, .HayyOj compared verbs to other verbal forms of the same root or of different roots. The forms used in these derivational processes were either attested biblical words or lexical forms created by Hjayyfj, some of which are not accepted lexemes of the language. Then, in his 1991 article, Ilan Eldar correctly identified this linguistic form (asl) as n'nflvn nto' rrn~, or "underlying basic form"; yet his ensuing discussion and analysis is limited (only six pages).6 The bulk of his work focuses on HayyOj's application of the concept and not on the development of the concept itself. Furthermore, Eldar failed to account for all of the variations of the derivational processes. He said, The concept of asl with reference to derivational process it [sic] is applied to underlying form and it refers to a theoretically expected form, i.e., that which conforms to the qiyds. The theoretical underlying forms are abstract and not 5. cAli Khalid Wathad, "The Linguistic Thinking of Rabbi Yehuda Hayyij Through His Terminology in Its Arabic Original and Their Hebrew Translations" (Master's thesis, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1984) (in Hebrew). 6.

The asl as applied by Hayyflj is not always an underlying form and in these cases cannot be identified as a stem, as implied by the phrase "nltin mna. Eldar's generality regarding HIayyOj's references to underlying forms with the linguistic term asl must be qualified. In effect, many of what Hayytj identified as underlying forms do not conform to modem scholarship's definition of the concept, in particular in transformational grammar. In contrast to Eldar's and cAli-Khalid's perspectives, the underlying form is not always the basic form (stem?) from which the surface form derives. The problem in correctly identifying the form used in these analogies is that Hayylj used one term, asl ("root"), to refer to different concepts and different processes. Though the same term is used, one cannot assume that the same method of derivation is occurring. A perusal of Hayyfj's works reveals some ambiguity in understanding his intentions regarding these derivations; some think that since HayyOj identified many verbs as "roots" (using the term asl), the indicated form must be a basic form. This, however, is not the case. A basic form implies a minimally inflected morphological unit of the verb--the verb at its most primitive state--other than its consonantal root. That is, the verb before the addition of formative letters, inflection markers, etc. But the form Hayytj identified was not always a basic form. Though he accepted many basic forms, when he compared verbs to others, more frequently than not the verbs used in the comparisons were not basic forms. Thus, it is best to call these items something other than "basic forms." In regard to analogies, their use was very common among both medieval Jewish and Muslim scholars.8 They made comparisons based on analogies in many disciplines, including philosophy and linguistics. In linguistics, philological analogies allowed grammarians to understand the relationship between words. Identifying this relationship, whether it was morphological or etymological, was important because then the meaning of one word could 7. Ibid., from English summary, p. vii. 8.

One use of morphological analogies was in determining the derivation of words. That is, two verbal forms could be semantically likened to each other if it could be shown that they were morphologically similar. 2.0 Asl: Underlying Form The first derivational process to be examined is that of underlying form, which is revealed through HayyOj's use of the Arabic term asl ("root"). It is recalled that even though the focus of Hayy0j's treatises was the presentation of the concept of the triliteral root, the most common usage for asl was the concept of underlying form, as stated above. The high frequency of the use of asl as "underlying form" reflects Hayy0j's immediate goals in writing ..d ,.j I j,,c. l, i JWY ,I and? .)L*I , JL cj . I y kS. While these are works of a philological nature, Hayyfj's primary goal was not to identify and list the consonantal roots of biblical verbs, but rather to introduce the concept of weak letters and identical radicals and their behavior. The use of the term asl for analogies was a very useful tool to that end. A verb's underlying form demonstrates that the verb derived from a triliteral root, and that its weak radicals underwent various morphological and phonological transformations. This comparative process effectively allowed Hayydj to support his new approach to Hebrew philology. The idea of deriving a verb from another form of verb in order to determine its morphological origin was first applied by Arab grammarians; the use of analogies was a popular tool used by such philologists as Sibawayhi (8th cent.) and ibn Djinni (10th cent.). In fact, Sibawayhi claimed that a primitive form of the surface forms of verbs existed. Haim Blanc explained Sibawayhi's approach: The most pervasive notion found in the Kitdb, as in all subsequent grammarians, with reference to derivational priority, is that of 'asl, lit. 'origin, root'. It is applied to basic, primary or underlying form; no explicit definition of it occurs, and it refers now to historically older form [sic], however vaguely conceived, now to theoretically normal or expected form, consistent with the (largely inexplicit) qiyds. The 'asl may or may not differ from the lafz. 'concrete, surface form', and is, in short, what the given form is, or should have been, "in principle."9 9. Blanc, "Diachronic and Synchronic Ordering," loc. cit.</page><page sequence="7">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYOJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 319 Thus, the idea of underlying forms, both ungrammatical forms and biblically attested words, was first used by Sibawayhi. Later Hebrew and Arabic grammarians also adopted this useful method. One of the first Hebrew philologists to use underlying forms in his work was Yehuda ibn Quraysh. In his tenth-century linguistic treatise "itftVin,'~ roots are referred to by the Arabic terms asl ("root") and uss ("foundation"). In discussing verbs in the hitpa 'l pattern that demonstrates the metathesis of the initial v of the root with the n of the pattern prefix, Ibn Quraysh did not directly identify the root. Instead, he compared the verbs to other verbs in order to suggest that they were from the same root. For example, regarding the verb inn.outl ("and he bowed down" Gen. 18:2), he wrote, "nVI... nM ,I ....I Inv =l I ,.I nnwn .1 [regarding] way-yifta~hn the foundation of the word is ?ahat ["bow!" Prov. 14:19] . .. . way-yiffaI ["and he bows" Isa. 2:9] ... wi-&amp;ah ["and he bowed" Isa. 2:17]. Dan Becker, in his 1984 critical edition of InSoWin, asserted that the intention of the author was not to say that there were three roots to the verb innull but rather to infer that its root was the same as the root of these three other words, i.e., the biradical n-v.'2 This is true, but more can be said of this passage. Ibn Quraysh said that the "foundation of the word" was ". inv, n ..o. . n. ..." He did not say that they share the same foundation. This is because he saw a derivational relationship between the verbal form inniv'n and the forms iniv, nvn, and ni. In modern linguistic studies, transformational-generative grammar distin- guishes between deep and surface structures of sentences. Noam Chomsky argues "that the phrase structure rules (and lexicon) generate the deep structures of sentences and that the rules of the transformational component of the syntax map these into surface structures."'3 Applying this theory to morphology, a surface form is one which is produced using the rules of the language from a specific form, known as the underlying form. This underlying 10. Yehuda ben Quraysh, n;1ro1n, ed. Dan Becker (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1984). 11. Ibid., p. 337. 12. Ibid., p. 63. 13.

In contrast, a stem is a form that is representative of an entire paradigm of forms; it allows for the addition of affixes.14 In other words, there is a direct morphological-derivational relationship between a deep structure and a surface structure; in fact, the surface form is predicted by rule. In Hebrew, abstract consonantal roots generate stems which in turn are transformed, with the addition of affixes, into lexemes of the language. Though in some languages, roots and stems may be identical, this is not the case in Hebrew. Even Hayytj differentiated between abstract roots and forms of a word. He identified roots as sets of individual consonants and not minimally inflected stems, which appear to be the third-person masculine singular perfect inflection in the pa'al pattern."' In the inflection of these stems, certain morphological and phonological changes occur to create other forms, some of which represent the deep structure of the language's lexemes. For HayyOj, the underlying form is an intermediary step in the application of linguistic and grammatical rules from the inflection of the stem to the creation of the surface structure. Actually, Hayyhj was less concerned with demonstrating a direct deriva- tional relationship between the underlying and surface forms than he was with providing examples which identify the triliteral root of the weak verb. In doing so, Hayytj used three types of underlying forms (all identified by the use of the term asl): (1) unattested/ungrammatical forms;16 (2) attested forms; and (3) geminated forms of radicals (see Figure 2). Yet, not all of these conform to the definition of a deep structure in transformational grammar or to the "primitive form" used by Sibawayhi. For Hayy0j, the underlying form (asl) was not always a form from which the verb derived or even a 14. Bent Jacobsen, Transformational-Generative Grammar (Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Co. 1977), p. 240. 15. For example, Hayyfij identified the root by its three individual radicals and not by any vocalized form, i.e., by the consonants n''p and not the lexeme nij, which appears to be the basic stem. HayyOj, p. 203, 1. 12. 16. "Ungrammatical" means that the verb does not follow the morphological or phonological rules of the language and consequently is not an accepted lexeme. For instance, the verbal form ?,!.p* ("will fall") is neither grammatical nor acceptable because the weak 3 should assimilate into the second radical in this inflection (see Figure 3). This definition is in contrast to "nonattested" forms, which refer to lexical items that may be grammatical but are not found in the Hebrew Bible.</page><page sequence="9">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYOJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 321 verbal form from the same root as the word in question, and consequently is not strictly a deep structure. In effect, one cannot always find a direct relationship between the underlying form and the surface structure, which cannot necessarily be predicted by rule. This is true in some places where the indicated form is an attested form derived from the same root as the verb in question. In these cases, the asl is often given only for the purpose of an analogy. Figure 2. Types of underlying forms a. Unattested/ungrammatical form representing intermediary step in inflection of verb; illustrates how verb would appear had weak or geminated letter not been assimilated, elided, or undergone some other morphological or phonological transformation. b. Attested-surface form of same root (often in another verbal pattern) which best preserves consonantal radicals. c. Geminated radical which is not geminated in given form due to phonological restrictions and/or morphological irregularities. 2.1 Unattested Verbs First, Hayy(j's application of an underlying form of an unattested verb is examined. An example of an unattested verb can be seen in the derivation of the third-person masculine singular imperfect inflection of the root ?-D-3 ("to fall"). There are three stages in the inflection of this verbal form, as shown in Figure 3. It is the form 5inl ("will fall") in (c) that represents the surface structure of the verb. The underlying structure is the intermediary form (b) ?5tr*. Recall that the underlying form usually demonstrates all three radicals, as is the case in (b). In effect, a deep structure form that fails to do this would not have any practical application for Hayyfj. Consequently, the philologist often identified unattested and ungrammatical verbal forms like 5iq,:* since they exhibited all three radicals.</page><page sequence="10">322 ROGER JAY KAPLAN Figure 3.

The application of this type of unattested underlying form is seen through- out Hayyfj's linguistic works. For example, regarding the verb 02 ("he rose"), Hayyfj wrote, llTtv) slnv) P.A 0 4- 1 '2,), 1 -.4,,i jll 6 ? , ..W jjj.2 I will make this clearer, saying that the underlying form of yaqmrn ["he rises up"] is [*]yiqyom, like yilm6r ["he judges"] yilprt ["he guards"]. Regarding the phrase "IN i'l1 ("the morning was light" Gen. 44:3) from the root "'--N ("to light"), Hayyfj said, I contend that the underlying form of the perfect 6r is [*]dwaw r [unattested] on the pattern qat^ntt ["I am not worthy" Gen. 32:11] yaq^itt ["I have laid a snare" Jer. 50:24] ydkh6l ["he is able" Gen. 32:26]. 17.

Ibid., p. 89, 1. 9.</page><page sequence="11">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYOJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 323 In text (2) HayyOj compared an ungrammatical verbal form (~'i'p*) with one which is attested (t inv). The verb utay is the third-person masculine singular imperfect inflection of the strong triliteral root V-D-v. Assuming that the verbal form M.'p2 is from the weak root lint0, HayyOj inflected this root in the same person, gender, number, and tense as tn9p, but as if the medial radical were strong. (He concluded that the medial radical was one of the matres lectiones because, among other things, the ' is consonantal in the verbal form _ip ["validated" Est. 9:32].) The outcome was ilt*,19 which Hayy(j then compared to two verbs with no weak radicals, namely itg, and "inY . A one-to-one comparison of each letter confirmed the philologist's hypothesis; just as "1-n-v were the radicals of the root of liny, so were u---p2 the radicals of n,~i*. Thus, HayyQj concluded that the underlying form of the verb 0112 was the form M~i',* not only because it was this ungrammatical form that represented how the verb should have been inflected had it not contained a medial weak radical but also because it demonstrated all three radicals. Text (3) is similar to the first as it uses a verb derived from a different root to create an analogy for the proposed underlying form. As he did with the form 13,2*, Hayyfj formed a hypothetical inflection of the root, in this case the root 1-1r derived the form "ilr*. This unattested verb is vocalized just as the verbal form 5'1 is. Similarly, the verbs 'nSt'~ and ',in.ip are inflected on the same pattern, but with the first-person perfect morpheme -ti^. Therefore, given that the three radicals of the verbal form 5i; are 5-D-' on the pattern pd'61, HayyQj asserted that the triliteral root of "~1 was r--K. Thus, the underlying form here is this ungrammatical form (nilx*) which demonstrates the three radicals of the weak root. It is worth pointing out that the underlying forms given by .Hayyoj do not represent stems of the surface forms. Yet, in each the underlying form allows one to predict the surface form. For example, with ni',2*, Hayytj argued that the medial weak radical requires the transformation to the surface form of r.. In fact, a difference between the applications of the underlying forms in passages (2) and (3) reveals an important point. The ungrammatical forms of each example are inflected according to different patterns-pd'al (in text [2]) versus pdc2' (in text [3]); in addition, a derivational relationship is drawn between a perfect inflection and an imperfect inflection (as in the case of the verb 0r), and between two perfect inflections (as in the case of the verb nix). 19. HayyQj accepted the I and ' as being interchangeable as medial weak radicals; conse- quently the form Wi',_* with ' from the root -r-ip was acceptable to him.</page><page sequence="12">324 ROGER JAY KAPLAN In the latter example, an imperfect form of ?ivl is attested: ?5D (Gen. 13:16). Therefore, it seems that HayyOj did not impose a hierarchical order for the tenses; that is, Hayyoj did not claim that one tense is derived from the other, or that the underlying form must be perfect (or imperfect). Instead, HayyOj chose whatever form, conjugation, or tense that best allowed him to illustrate his point and make the analogy. For the verb tnp;, it was the pdcal imperfect, but for "i, it was the pdC61 perfect. 2.2 Attested Verbs In contrast to the examples above, HayyOj used attested verbal forms as underlying forms of some weak verbs. Using the same root, HayyQj changed the verbal pattern of the underlying form from that of the surface form. In other words, HayyOj may have used the pic'l form of a root as the underlying form of a pd~al surface form of the same root. In effect, in these cases "underlying forms" function for comparative purposes and not to demonstrate a derivational relationship, but were specifically chosen because they demonstrate all three radicals of the root of the surface structure. Since these grammatical forms are inflected in another verbal pattern, there is no direct derivational relationship, and consequently they do not conform to transformational grammar's definition for deep structures. One example of an underlying form of an analogy that includes an attested verb as given by Hayyfj is the form v)_ ("validated" Est. 9:32). To illustrate the absent medial weak radical (1) in the verbs ani ("they rose up" Ps. 86:14) and ai ("he rose up" I Sam 17:48), HayyOj wrote, z,ivirl , vi(sic) nx mDp 0' A; m?, ,.,lj I Lj. I _l 1. " 1.4 Between the qaf and mern is the latent quiescent which is the second radical, its underlying form is qiyyain as in qiyyanm it divriy ha-purim hd 'elle ["validating these observances of Purim" Est. 9:32]. Text (4) shows that the underlying form of the verb in, is the form ip. The latter verb, from Est. 9:32, with the geminated , reveals that the radicals 20. HayyQj, p. 66, 11. 12-13. HayyQj's (or the scribe's) version of this biblical passage is defective; the preposition nf is not in the Masoretic text.</page><page sequence="13">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYOJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 325 of the former are '1 and a with a medial weak radical-the '. Hayyfj used M0,. because it showed all three radicals of the root as inflected in the pical pattern. In order to demonstrate that the perfect inflection ty derived from the medial weak triliteral root l-j-a, I;Hayytj found another form of the verb, in this case an attested biblical form, that preserved the three radicals. Hayytj concluded that if the form 19,. was from the root '-'-p, then by analogy, so was the verb .va. Again, even though both verbs have the same consonantal root and Hayytj used the term asl for these processes, i'. is not the stem or the deep structure of the verb =1 derived. In fact, the surface form cannot be predicted from the indicated form: tWi? is a third-person perfect pd'al verb, and trp is a third-person imperfect pical verb. Another example of a derivational relationship with an attested form involves the verbs 'Sryin ("I made known" Hos. 5:9) and 'Syi ("I have appointed" I Sam 21:3). Regarding them, H.ayyftj wrote,21 Indeed (the verb) is said with yod and with hlz' (as in) w'-et ha-nd'riun y6da'tt ("and the young men I have appointed" I Sam. 21:3), and its underlying form is h6da'tt (Ezek. 20:11, Hos. 5:9). In text (5), Hayytj claimed that the underlying form of the verb '1'i' was '?nyri-both derived from the root T"-'. Hayyfj's analysis of these words differs from that of modern linguists. Whereas HayyOj concluded that the two words were the same verbal form with only the orthographic difference of the initial letter-i versus ', modern scholarship derives the two words from different conjugation patterns with different meanings. Specifically, it is argued that the verb '1nYi' is inflected in the p6'al pattern meaning "I have appointed" (I Sam 21:3),23 and that 'Swyin is inflected in the hifil meaning "I make known" (Hos. 5:9). Hayyfj's use of the linguistic term asl here indicates that the underlying form is the "correct" form, i.e., the way that he thought the word should have been written. That is, he saw 'i.Yi' as being directly derived from 'nylin; the underlying form of 'T.i' is 'nlin. because the latter 21. Ibid., p. 15, 11. 6-7, see n. 23 below. 22. Ibid., p. 15, 11. 6-7. 23.

HayyOj derived the form 'Inylin from the hifil inflection of the weak root ~-r-,, making it the "correct" spelling, and considered 'inYi' a defective form of this verb. Consequently, one can conclude that here the asl is, in fact, an underlying form of the surface form. HIayyfj believed that the form 'i.P' could be predicted from the underlying form '9.P iY since the consonants r and' were often interchangeable.24 2.3 Individual Radical Hayyfj used the same comparative process when discussing specific radicals of a root. He identified a few words which he thought required clarification regarding their pointing, in particular the gemination of one of their radicals. In these cases, Hayyftj claimed a non-geminated radical should have carried ddgS-'. Thus, he referred to the geminated form of the radical as the underlying form of the non-geminated radical. For example, Hebrew phonetic rules do not allow for ddg-s' in the gutturals and the consonant 1 even though morphological and/or phonological conditions may call for such pointing. These circumstances led HayyOj to argue that since the radical should have had ddgj?, the underlying form was the geminated guttural. To illustrate this point, let us look at the verb ping ("I will be exalted" Isa. 33:10), which Hayylfj compared with the unattested form rinxt, both from the root -n-. Of onif, HIayyfj wrote,25 The rjyl should be geminated to account for the assimilation of the taiv. Hayytj considered this verb an inflection of the hitpe' l pattern. In effect, he argued that because the n of the hitpaeil prefix has been assimilated, the following consonant, the I (also the first radical), should have taken ddgi?. In text (6), the underlying form is not another verbal form or conjugation of the word in question, but rather the orthographic representation and the corresponding pronunciation of a radical in that word. Here Hayyoj used the term asl ("underlying form") to refer to the gemination of the letter I in 24. Kaplan, "Critical Analysis," p. 208. 25. HayyQj, p. 121, 11. 11-12.</page><page sequence="15">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYUJJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 327 the word and not to another lexeme of the medial weak root -rn-. .HayyOj explained the peculiarity of this verb by showing how one of its radicals theoretically should have been written and/or pronounced. He demonstrated this by showing that the radical 1, in the given word Don~, was not geminated even though it should have been. Therefore, even though the underlying form, the geminated 1, is hypothetical, it demonstrates what Hayyoj thought the correct form was and how the verb in question deviated from it. Again, the underlying form is not the whole verbal form, but rather the deep structure of just the radical. 3.0 Analogies The second process by which Hayyfj examined derivational relationships was the use of analogies, a method of inquiry common to medieval Jewish and Muslim scholars, as mentioned above. Two types of analogies are found in Hayyoj's works. One is analogies to forms derived from the abstract root 5-Y-!, and the other is analogies to forms derived from strong verbs. In each, Hayyoj's primary intent is maintained-to show the derivation of weak verbs from triliteral roots. 3.1 Analogies to the Root 5?-' HayyOj examined derivational relationships by comparing given verbs to their analogous inflections in the Hebrew root 5-Y-D (P-c-L). This type of analogy was effective for several reasons. First, a verb that does not display all of its radicals in its surface form can be hard to identify, but by showing its analogy with a strong verb, not only can the three radicals be identified more easily but so can its full inflection, including verbal pattern, tense, gender, and person. Second, being a strong root, ?-Y- can be used as an abstract example in Hebrew morphology, because it does not lose any of its radicals in any inflection.26 In these cases the Arabic term asl does not appear and thus these analogies are not underlying forms. 26. This is so despite the guttural Y in the root, which cannot be geminated in the pi'cl and hitp~ijl patterns. For HayyQj's purposes and according to his definition of weak radicals (i.e., X, ,I, I, or '), the root ,-Y-D is an appropriate choice as it does not include any weak radicals and consequently none is omitted from any inflection.</page><page sequence="16">328 ROGER JAY KAPLAN Hayy0j's deliberate choice of the Hebrew root -i,-D for these analogies is significant. In doing so, he rejected the opinion of the "first Hebrew grammarian," Sa'adia Gaon (882-942), who chose the root ,-a-t, for the model abstract Hebrew root.27 Hayy0j's rejection of Sa'adia Gaon's choice revealed the influence of medieval Arabic grammarians who began using the cognate Arabic root F-'-L (J-~ -j) to abstract morphological forms as early as the eighth century.28 The tenth-century Arabic grammarian ibn Djinni made this very clear when he wrote: Know that when he [the grammarian] speaks of the root he means the fd', the 'ayn, and the idm [i.e., the first, second, and third radicals of the root], and the additions [formatives] are what is not fd', Yayn, or ldm: An example of this is daraba ["he hit"]; the ddd from daraba is the first radical of the root, the rad its second, and the ba' its third ... In both Hebrew and Arabic, the words meaning "verb," pocal ( D) in Hebrew and fi'l (J.%) in Arabic, are derived from the same Semitic root. Clearly, Hayy0j saw the effectiveness of using this root in Arabic and thus applied it to Hebrew for the same purposes. Though Hayyoj did not rely solely upon the root 5-,-D for analogous forms, he frequently employed it. By using the abstract root, Hayyfij was able to indicate which radicals of a verb were the first, second, and third by showing their analogous places in a form derived from this root. He also identified the tense and/or person of a verb using this process. For example, he compared the imperfect inflections of the root ,-T-'- to analogous inflections of the root 5-Y-D. The verbs r.n ("you will know") and ,Y1 ("I will know") were likened to the forms ?,y.n and _px, respectively. IHayyij's 27.

By doing so, HayyQj showed that the geminated (which represents two "s, i.e., In,,o*) of this imperfect verb was both the tense inflection marker and the first radical. In other words, when each word is stripped of all inflectional markers, the remaining letters are the radicals. Consequently, just as the root of 'D1' is b?--D, the root of .n nl is nn-'.31 This type of analogy was also used by HayyQj to show that a verb is not from a certain weak root. For example, Hayy0j contended that the verbal form on'.in ("you measured" Num. 34:10) was not from the final weak root n-T-n. If it was from this root, then the analogous form derived from the root 'b--D would be mnn)brn. He said, however, that no such form existed in all of the Bible and concluded that opn'n, was not from this root but from another.32 In other words, the n does not represent the first radical as the ! of ?l'!~Yr does.33 3.2 Analogies to Strong Roots The third type of derivational process was analogies to strong verbal forms. For example, in discussing initial weak verbs, HayyQj compared the verbal form '3~t ("he covered me" Isa. 61:10) to the strong verb '324 ("he guarded me" unattested). He wrote, y dtdct^ is like mrinr 34, . .8 30. Hayylj, p. 44, 1. 15. 31. Ibid., p. 45, 1. 15. 32. Ibid., p. 218, 11. 2-6. He may have been making this point to argue against Menahem ben Saraq (Menahem ben SartOq, Sifer Mahberet Menathem, ed. Herschell Filipowski [London: Hevrat Me'orerei Yeshanim, 1854], p. 183), who said that this verb was from the biliteral root n-r. Brown (et al., Hebrew and English Lexicon, p. 16) derived it from the root '-r-H inflected in the hifil pattern. 33. Hayyfj, p. 218, 11. 2-5. It can be said that Hayyfij contradicted himself by deriving the form nrn and then saying that it did not exist. 34. Ibid., p. 54, 1. 6.</page><page sequence="18">330 ROGER JAY KAPLAN This passage (8) shows the analogy of a weak verb to a strong verb. Here, HayyOj did not use the Hebrew root '-"-D to find an analogous form for the verb. Instead, he directly compared the verb ~ot to the verb tmipt in order to indicate what were the three radicals of the former verbal form (i.e., 0-t-') and what was its inflection-that being third-person masculine singular perfect with the first-person singular pronominal suffix. In other places, Hayyoj added that a word's morphology was "i#j ," ("on the pattern") of a strong verb. For instance, the pa'al infinitive of the weak root nv- is jiv? ("to sleep"), which, according to HayyOj, was "on the pattern" of ~lbV ("to keep") and li.t. ("to break").35 The analogy of the form jiv? to an infinitive of a strong verb explains its unusual inflection and that it is also an infinitive of the pd'al verbal pattern. This type of analogy is rare in his works, but nonetheless is one of the methods by which HayyQj identified the morphology of verbs. 4.0 Summary and Conclusions This study has explored derivational processes in Hayytj's linguistic treatises. There are two processes by which Hayyaj examined the derivational relationships of weak verbs: (1) he identified the underlying form (deep structure) of the verb; (2) he employed two types of linguistic analogies: (a) he compared the verb to an analogous verb in the root ?-,-D; and (b) he compared the verb to a strong verb of the same inflection. In order to understand what methods were used by HayyQj, we first looked at his use of the term asl ("root"), which was found to have more than one meaning. Besides referring to consonantal roots and one individual radical of that root, asl refers to the underlying form of a verb. The underlying form proved to be the most frequent and productive process by which Hayytj explored Hebrew morphology. In fact, he utilized three types of underlying forms: (1) unattested/ungrammatical forms, (2) attested forms, and (3) geminated forms of radicals. By using the underlying form in analogies, Hayytj was able to show how weak verbal forms derived from triliteral roots. The examination of these derivational methods revealed that the underly- ing form was not the basic form or the stem of the weak verb. For Hayytj, the underlying form, identified by the linguistic term asl, was frequently a 35. Ibid., p. 63, 11. 4-5.</page><page sequence="19">DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN HAYYOJ'S LINGUISTIC WORKS 331 theoretical ungrammatical derived form of the verb in question, similar to the "primitive form" employed by Sibawayhi. These forms, as well as those for individual radicals, were found to be true deep structures of the verbs in question. Some attested forms, however, in particular those derived from verbal patterns different from that of the weak verb, cannot be called deep structures; this even though HayyOj continued to label this type of derivational process with the term asl. Despite his attempt to show the derivation of weak verbs from triliteral roots, he did not always give the underlying form of the verb that would indicate its direct derivation. Instead, in a number of cases, H.ayy0j applied the same term (asl) for forms that did not demonstrate a direct derivational relationship with the weak verb in question. In fact, the forms indicated by asl cannot be used to predict the surface form by rule; instead they merely demonstrated the three radicals of the root. After all, Hayytj's overriding purpose in writing his linguistic treatises was to show the derivation of weak verbs from triliteral roots. Though he may have derived the underlying forms in the process, he did not seek to indicate them for each example. Consequently, not all his references to the linguistic term asl are truly deep structures. Transformational grammar requires a direct derivational relationship between the deep and surface structures, but in a number of Hayytj's examples, only an indirect relationship can be cited. Thus, while HayyOj may have been responsible for introducing the concept of deep structures to Hebrew philology, he did not consistently apply the term with which he associated the concept. Furthermore, regarding analogies made to verbs derived from the abstract root ?-Y'D and to strong verbs, HayyOj did not provide underlying forms to show the exact derivations, but rather, he sought verbal forms which indicated which radicals of the verb were the first, second, and third. Again this illustrates the philologist's goal to provide proof of the derivation of weak verbs from triliteral roots and not necessarily to document the deep structures of those verbs. By showing analogous derivational relationships, Hayy0j supported his thesis regarding the behavior of weak radicals, and introduced valuable new tools to Hebrew linguistics, including the abstract root ''''. HayyOj was not only responsible for articulating the concept of trilit- eral roots and weak letters in Hebrew morphology, but for adding to our understanding of Hebrew philology. His comparative processes, some of which have been explored here, were new and innovative approaches to</page><page sequence="20">332 ROGER JAY KAPLAN understanding the Hebrew language in the Middle Ages. HayyOj introduced students of the Hebrew language to the concept of the triliteral root and explained in depth the process by which he arrived at his conclusions. While one's conclusions are of the utmost importance, it is equally important for scholars to develop a methodology and systematically prove a thesis. Hayyoj did just that; he developed new ideas and also provided new tools of inquiry for Hebrew studies which have been in use ever since. Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio</page></plain_text>
