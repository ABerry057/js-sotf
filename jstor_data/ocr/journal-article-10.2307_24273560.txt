Key moments in this sugya center center around food: the shame of Bar Kamza at a feast sparks his eventual eventual betrayal of the Jews, the tale of Marta bat Boethus recounts the the starvation of the wealthiest woman in Jerusalem, and Caesar destroys destroys Tur Malka in retaliation for an opulent banquet. This article contextualizescontextualizes these rabbinic narratives within the social politics of Roman Roman and Sasanian banquet culture, while also parsing the intersec Hons Hons of gender, class, and social status in these disaster tales. Through its its critical representation of high-class oblivion, the sugya calls atten tion tion to the ethical cost of elite status by highlighting the physical and moral moral dangers of social privilege. Its stories of luxurious eating emphasize emphasize how corrosive concerns about status and shame often lead lead elites to protect their private interests by sacrificing the well-being of of the broader community. Its feasting narratives assert that wealth, luxury,luxury, and social privilege distance elites from the awareness of suf fering in their midst. In the fifth chapter of Bavli Gittin, one of the Babylonian Talmud's most elaborate narratives on the destruction of Jerusalem lays the blame for the destruc tion on a disastrous late antique dinner party—on the inhospitality, shame, and betrayal sparked by a banquet gone wrong. Sharing food plays a central role in the sugya, making visible the politicized abundance of conspicuous consumption, the bountiful largess of wealthy patrons, the ritual practice of public fasting, and the abject disaster of famine. Most existing scholarship on food in rabbinic literature has focused on the way eating expresses Jewish identity, examining how particular culinary traditions, food abstentions, and table practices fashion a certain kind of Jewish difference.1 By contrast, the food narratives in this This article was written while I was a Research Associate and Visiting Assistant Professor in the Women's Studies in Religion Program at Harvard Divinity School. I am profoundly grateful to Harvard Divinity School for their generous support of my scholarship, and to Missouri State University for granting me professional leave to pursue my research.

Instead, the sugya's focus on food draws attention to dynamics of social status and shame, dramatizing complex intersections of gender, class, and social prestige through the public experience of feasting, fasting, and starving. Feasting narratives expose what Michael Dietler has called "the micropolitics of daily life," illuminating complex social dimensions of disaster.2 Through the recurring motif of food and its absence, Bavli Gittin navigates the social and material implications of disaster—expressing both rabbinic culp ability and human vulnerability through the fantasies of a well-stocked larder and the fear of gnawing hunger. The Bavli draws attention to the social and pol itical dynamics that drive conspicuous consumption and luxurious desires, as well as the material realities of hunger and famine. These stories of luxurious eating emphasize how corrosive concerns about status and shame often lead elites to protect their private interests by sacrificing the well-being of the broader commu nity. By dramatizing the social allure of the feast, the Bavli sheds light on the way that elite culture promotes spectacles of consumption that draw all eyes toward the privileged table. The sugya,s feasting narratives also make visible the way that wealth, luxury, and social privilege distance elites from the awareness of suffering in their midst. Over the course of the sugya, the Bavli articulates striking concerns about the collateral costs of opulent wealth, calling attention to the way that extra vagant luxury isolates and insulates those who dine at the fanciest tables from the gritty realities of violence and danger. Feasting Politics: Status, Shame, and the Late Antique Banquet Bavli Gittin's sugya on destruction opens with a startling suggestion: Rabbi Yohanan claims that Rome's destruction of Jerusalem and violent response to the Bar Kokhba revolt came about through three tiny but tragic misunderstandings. When an anonymous host instructs his servant to invite a friend named Kamza to his feast, the servant instead brings Bar Kamza, his enemy—a mistake that sparks a disastrous chain of events that culminates in the destruction of the Temple. When the master finds the wrong man dining at his banquet, he refuses to play host to his enemy and throws Bar Kamza out of the feast. Seething with the shame of this public indignity, Bar Kamza resolves to turn informer, reports to Rome that the Jews are rebelling against the emperor, and then frames the eating systems and the phenomenon of "transgressive" Jewish eating that pushes or breaks religious or cultural boundaries. Rosenblum examines how tannaitic sources craft distinctive Jewish identity through dietary regulations, cooking practices, and table fellowship, emphasizing how foodways com municate social identity. 2. Archeologist Michael Dietler argues that feasts and feasting rituals represent a critical area in which people express social, economic, and political relationships, describing feasts as both "inherently political and ... a fundamental instrument and theater of political relations."

Bar Kamza prompts Caesar to send the Jews a calf to sacrifice as a test of their loyalty, but deliberately maims the animal so that it cannot be sacrificed according to rabbinic halakhah. As they are torn between the conflicting demands of appeasing the ruling kingdom and acting according to their own interpretation of the law, the rabbis' inaction provokes Rome's ire: Rabbi Yohanan said: What is it that is written: "Blessed is the man who is always afraid, but the one who hardens his heart falls into misfortune?" (Proverbs 28:14) Jerusalem was destroyed over Kamza and Bar Kamza. Tur Malka was destroyed over a rooster and a hen. Beitar was destroyed over the shaft of a litter. Jerusalem was destroyed over Kamza and Bar Kamza: A man who was friends with Kamza but who hated Bar Kamza held a feast. He said to his servant: "Go and bring me Kamza." [The servant] went and brought him Bar Kamza. [The host] went and found him sitting there. He said, "Since you are my enemy, why did you come here? Get up and go!" [Bar Kamza] said to him, "Since I have come, leave me alone and I will give you money for what I eat and drink." [The host] said to him, "No." [Bar Kamza] said to him, "I will give you the money for half your feast." He said to him, "No." He said to him, "I will give you the money for your entire feast." He said to him, "No." [The host] seized him and forced him to get up and go. [Bar Kamza] said, "Since the rabbis were sitting there and did not protest, I will go and inform against them at the king's palace." He said to Caesar, "The Jews are rebelling against you." He said to him: "Says who?" He said to him, "Send them an offering and see if they sacrifice it for you." He sent with him a three-year-old calf. As he was traveling, he caused a blemish on the upper lip—and some say, a cataract in its eye, which for us is a blemish but for them is not a blemish. The rabbis reasoned that they should sacrifice it for the sake of peace with the kingdom. Rabbi Zekhariah ben Avkulos said to them: "They will say that blemished creatures may be sacrificed on the altar!" They reasoned that they should kill him, lest he go and tell him. R. Zekhariah ben Avkulos said to them: They will say that one who brings a blemished sacrifice should be killed!" Rabbi Yohanan said: "The meekness of of R. Zekhariah ben Avkulos destroyed our temple, set fire to our sanctuary, and exiled us from our land."3 The Bavli's story dramatizes the far-reaching consequences of a mistaken banquet invitation. But while the feast is a critical element in the tale, the rabbinic account provides little discussion of the meal itself: food matters socially, not as suste nance.4 The banquet serves as a space to contest the host's lavish generosity and portray the intense danger of public shame. 3. B. Gittin 55b-56a. 4. In this respect, the rabbinic story is manifestly at odds with many Roman writers who focus extensively on the food served at banquets. John D'Arms discusses the role of elaborate food and drink 91</page><page sequence="4">Julia Julia Watts Belser In the coveted social circles of late antiquity, banquets helped shape elites' awareness of their own cultured nobility, singling out the illustrious few from the plebian masses. Situating the narrative within elite Roman and Sasanian feasting practices illuminates the way the Bar Kamza story uses the visible space of the feast to communicate complex dynamics of friendship, loyalty, and hatred.5 In elite Roman and Sasanian circles, banquets afforded hosts a privileged opportunity to display their largess and demonstrate their esteem for their invited guests. Hosting an elaborate banquet was a central strategy for representing oneself as a generous, urbane man.6 Public generosity granted the host considerable power and generated social debt—at least until guests had the opportunity to reciprocate.7 Analyzing the talmudic narrative in this context highlights the cultural signifi cance of public feasting and heightens the significance of Bar Kamza's mistaken invitation. By inviting the wrong man to his master's banquet, the servant inadver tently forges a social bond between the host and his enemy. When the host sees Bar Kamza at the feast, he refuses to tolerate his enemy's presence. The host's abrupt command, "Get up and go!" reasserts control over the social space of the feast. But Bar Kamza resists. Threatened with public humiliation and facing the prospect of eviction from the coveted social space of the banquet, Bar Kamza negotiates for a in crafting the atmosphere of spectacle at elite Roman banquets, noting Macrobius's opinion that food and drink are commonly on exhibition and parade, "more for show than for nutritional use." See Macro bius, Saturnalia Convivia, 7.5.32. John D'Arms, "Performing Culture: Roman Spectacle and the Ban quets of the Powerful," in The Art of Ancient Spectacle, ed. Bettina Bergmann and Christine Kondoleon (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 303. 5. While the Bar Kamza story is set in Palestine and concerns the behavior of Palestinian Jews, the Bavli's narrative is likely shaped by a feasting culture common among both Roman and Sasanian elites. Matthew Canepa suggests that, beginning in the late third century, both Roman and Sasanian rulers used increasingly similar rituals of public display at banquets, rituals, and other public events to communicate visually to their own subjects and to each other the majesty of their kingship and the magnificence of their largess. Matthew P. Canepa, The Two Eyes of the Earth: Art and Ritual of Kingship Kingship between Rome and Sasanian Iran (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009), 188. 6. D'Arms emphasizes the importance of hosting in elite Roman culture: "For a Roman notable, the ostentatious exhibition of wealth was part of self-representation; it reinforced the great man's sense of his own power over those personally bound to him by the ties of clientela, and it set him and his social and political equals, the lofty few, apart from the rest of Roman society, the obscure many." D'Arms, "Performing Culture," 308-9. 7. My thinking about feasting is shaped by anthropological thought on the social and political implications of gift exchange. Dietler emphasizes that while feasts are commonly viewed primarily as a means of expressing social solidarity and reinforcing a sense of community, they also create relation ships of social superiority and inferiority. In this regard, he argues that hospitality has great potential "to be manipulated as a tool in defining social relations." Michael Dietler, "Feasts and Commensal Poli tics," in Food and the Status Quest: An Interdisciplinary Perspective, ed. Polly Wiessner and Wulf Schiefenhovel (Providence: Berghahn Books, 1996), 91-2. Marcel Mauss emphasizes that agonistic forms of gift exchange foster competitive and aggressive responses, in which shame plays a significant role. By contrast, nonagonistic forms of gift exchange tend to foster relationships through hospitality. Marcel Mauss, The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies, trans. W.D.

"Since I have come," he says, "let me stay." He offers to compensate the host for his own food and drink, thus relieving the host of the need to cover the cost of his own plate. When that offer is rejected, Bar Kamza offers to pay half the host's expenses and then to pay for the entire feast. But the host rejects Bar Kamza's bid, refusing to allow Bar Kamza to play generous provider to the other man's guests. Through the escalating negotiations, the Bavli reveals Bar Kamza's increasing desperation—his willingness to pay any price to avoid the stigma of forcible expulsion from the feast. Many studies of rabbinic society have focused on the profound fear of shame within the intense study-house culture of rabbinic Babylonia.8 Yet in elite late antique culture, banquets also evoked powerful fears about public shame. The cultural power of a banquet had a double edge: while elites could gain prestige through public attendance at the feast of a powerful patron, they also suffered scrutiny and risked considerable potential for shame. Public feasts made plain the realities of social status: guests' relative status was visible and on display through complex seating and serving hierarchies.9 Classicist John D'Arms notes the widespread presence of Roman banquet anxieties in Roman sources, especially the fear of ridicule by the host or a more powerful guest. "At some banquets," D'Arms writes, "feelings of inferior status left guests con vinced that they had been placed under sinister surveillance [convivarum censura,censura, in Seneca's phrase] by their hosts or by powerful members of their hosts' households; in effect, they felt themselves transformed from watchers to watched."10 Roman and Sasanian royals even used banquets to administer public punishment. After the late sixth-century Sasanian ruler Kosrow II regained his throne from a usurper, he brought the defeated general to a royal banquet in chains, to display his mutilated body before the jeers and mockery of guests, and then publically executed him. Another ruler, Kavadh I, rebuked a general for his failures on the battlefield by stripping him of his sash and other marks of favor at a royal banquet. Banquets were a potent space for expressing power through the use of public shame.11 8. Many interpreters connect this shame with the common rabbinic motif that the Second Temple was destroyed on account of causeless hatred. The tradition that the Second Temple was destroyed on account of causeless hatred appears in T. Menahot 13:22, and paralleled in Y. Yoma 1:1 1:1 38c and B. Yoma 9b. See David Kraemer, Responses to Suffering in Classical Rabbinic Literature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), 176-7. By contrast, Jonathan Crane demonstrates that other rabbinic sources emphasize the ability to feel shame as a sign of moral development. Accordingly, B. Shabbat 119b describes shamelessness as one of the causes of the destruction of the Temple. Jonathan K.

As Jeffery Rubenstein notes, the talmudic narrative includes no mention of rabbinic presence at the Bar Kamza banquet.12 Ironically, Bar Kamza's words evoke rabbinic authority in order to condemn the rabbis' inaction. His remark serves to rabbinize the story, bringing the elite banquet into the orbit of rabbinic culture and introducing a rabbinic presence in what originally appeared to be a nonrabbinic feast.13 Bar Kamza's anger highlights the heightened stakes of rabbinic authority. It reveals the dramatic consequences of the original moment of rabbinic silence—and the rabbis' failure to respond decisively once Bar Kamza presents them with the sacrificial calf. Through this vivid portrayal of the terrible price of rabbinic inaction, the rabbis shoulder responsibility for the devastation that follows. In the rabbis' own accounting, their piety, prestige, and communal leadership obligate them to an exacting standard of behavior. Their flaws are magnified; their failures bear bitter fruit.14 Because the rabbis did not protest his treatment, Bar Kamza resolves to inform upon them before the Roman emperor. The Bavli uses an idiomatic expression to describe the act of turning informer, describing Bar Kamza as 12. Jeffrey Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 148. 13. The term "rabbinization" has been used to discuss the Bavli's tendency to describe early Jewish wonder-workers and other nonrabbinic figures in ways that make them resemble rabbis, thereby appropriating these figures as protorabbis and bringing them into the realm of rabbinic culture. Bar Kamza's remark seems to serve a similar purpose, retroactively situating the feast within rabbinic space. On the phenomenon of rabbinization in rabbinic literature, see William Scott Green, "Palestinian Holy Men: Charismatic Leadership and Rabbinic Traditions," ANRW II 19, no. 2 (1979): 619-47; Baruch M. Bosker, "Wonder-Working and the Rabbinic Tradition: The Case of of Hanina ben DosaJSJ 16 (1985): 42-92; Richard Kalmin, "Christians and Heretics in Rabbinic Lit erature of Late Antiquity," The Harvard Theological Review 87, no. 2 (April 1994); and Richard Kalmin, "Holy Men, Rabbis, and Demonic Sages in Late Antiquity," in Jewish Culture and Society under under the Christian Roman Empire, ed. Richard Kalmin and Seth Schwartz (Leuven: Peeters Press, 2003). 14. A similar dynamic appears in other talmudic stories in which famous rabbis are rebuked or suffer intense grief on account of seemingly minor ethical lapses, suggesting that the rabbis held them selves to higher standards of piety—and often suffered on account of this expectation. B. Nedarim 62a recounts a tradition about Rabbi Tarfon, who reportedly grieved "all the days of his life" for making use of his status as a Torah scholar to save himself from murder. For a discussion of this narrative, see Shu lamit Valler, Sorrow and Distress in the Babylonian Talmud (Boston: Academic Studies Press, 2011), 18-24. Jonathan Schofer argues that a motif of "trivial sins" appears frequently in rabbinic literature, in which God punishes harshly apparently minor transgressions committed by sages. Schofer argues that this motif emphasizes the ethical significance of a sage's every action and intention, no matter how minor. See Jonathan Wyn Schofer, "Protest or Pedagogy? Trivial Sin and Divine Justice in Rabbinic Narrative," Hebrew Union College Annual 74 (2003): 243-278; and Jonathan Wyn Schofer, Confronting Confronting Vulnerability: The Body and the Divine in Rabbinic Ethics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003). 94</page><page sequence="7">Opulence and Oblivion going to "eat destruction" at the house of the king.15 Denied satisfaction at the Jewish banquet, he aims to dine, at least symbolically, at the emperor's table.16 But Bar Kamza not only partakes of imperial largess, he manipulates it. Once he shifts his allegiance to Rome, he persuades Caesar to send a barbed "gift" to his erstwhile compatriots, a calf for sacrifice that will serve as a test of Jewish loyalty to Rome. By convincing Caesar to send the Jews an animal for sacrifice, Bar Kamza accentuates long-standing tensions over Jewish loyalty that were expressed through the symbolic performance of sacrifice. Though many Roman subjects made sacrifices to the reigning Roman emperor, Jews were generally allowed to make a sacrifice to the God of Israel on the emperor's behalf—a complex negotiation of loyalties that aimed to allow Jews to express the exclusiv ity of their religious commitments, while still demonstrating political allegiance to Rome.17 Because the rituals of sacrifice were sites of complex and contested pol itical and theological meanings, sacrifice was often a flashpoint for controversy and revolt.18 Bar Kamza forces the rabbis to accommodate Caesar's dangerous gift. Imperial generosity entangles the Jewish community in the fraught politics of sacrifice—and exposes them to the spurned emperor's deadly rage. Patronage and Conspicuous Provision: Food, Famine, and Generosity in Wartime Vespasian's siege of Jerusalem initiates the second cluster of food narratives in the Bavli Gittin sugya, which dramatize the political significance of food in the context of war. In the Roman world, famine was a deliberate strategy of war, not simply an inadvertent side effect of conflict.19 Ancient accounts of cities under 15. The literal meaning of the expression is difficult to parse. In this form, it appears only in the construction 'okhlei karz'a: to inform against.

(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), 1003. In B. Berakhot 58a, the phrase is used in a story that likewise pits the rabbis against the emperor: Rav Shila lashed a man who had sexual relations with an Egyptian woman, and the man went and informed upon him before the emperor. 16.

Hunger made a city significantly 95</page><page sequence="8">Julia Julia Watts Belser siege provide vivid portrayals of famine, often using depictions of cannibalism to dramatize the horrors and inhumanity of life within.20 The Bavli's discussion of Vespasian's siege highlights the political causes of famine, heightening the drama of the disaster by emphasizing that starvation was not inevitable: [Caesar] sent Vespasian against them. He came and besieged them for three years. In the city were three rich men: Nakdimon ben Gurion, Ben Kalba Savu'a, and Ben Zizit Hakeset. Nakdimon ben Gurion—the sun cut through [nakdah][nakdah] [the clouds] on his account. Ben Kalba Savu'a—for anyone who entered his house starving like a dog [kalba] left satisfied [sav'a]. Ben Zizit Hakeset—because the [ritual] fringes [zizit] [of his garment] dangled from fancy cushions [kesatot]\ and there are those who say—because his seat [kesoto][kesoto] lay among the great ones of Rome. One said to them, "I will provide you with wheat and barley One said to them, "And I, with wine and oil." One said to them, "And I, with wood." The rabbis praised the wood, for Rav Hisda entrusted all of his keys to a servant, save for the woodshed, for Rav Hisda said, "One storehouse of wheat requires sixty storehouses of wood." They had provisions enough for twenty-one years. But there were some rebels among them. The rabbis said to them, "Let us go and make peace with [the Romans]." [The rebels] did not permit it. They said to [the rabbis], "Let us go and make war against them." The rabbis said to them, "It will not work." [The rebels] arose and burned all the stores of wheat and barley, and there was famine.21 In this scene, Bavli Gittin recounts how three wealthy men give provisions abun dant enough to sustain Jerusalem for twenty-one years.22 Unlike the anonymous host who refuses Bar Kamza a place at his table and thereby initiates the more likely to capitulate to a siege—and late antique war manuals discuss strategies for destroying crops, trees, and food stores, as well as methods for poisoning wells or water reservoirs. See discussion in Dionysius Ch. Stathakopoulos, Famine and Pestilence in the Late Roman and Early Byzantine Empire:Empire: A Systematic Survey of Subsistence Crises and Epidemics (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing House, 2004), 46-8. 20. Noting that "no siege was complete without [the depiction] of a mother eating her child," Shaye Cohen emphasizes that this motif was already common in literature by the sixth century BCE, appearing in Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10. Shaye J. D. Cohen, "The Destruction: From Scripture to Midrash," Prooftexts 2 (1982): 22. Sage also notes the widespread appearance of this trope in Roman sources. Sage, Republican Roman Army, 282. 21.21. B. Gittin 56a. 22. The tale is surely hyperbolic on this point—twenty-one years is an unrealistic amount of time in the context of ancient siege warfare. Even large, fortified cities rarely held out for more than a a year when under siege. Analyzing the relationship between famine and siege warfare in the Roman and Byzantine Empires from the mid-fourth to the mid-eighth century, Stathakopoulus notes that the duration of sieges varied. A year was common for a larger, well-fortified city, with smaller ones often capitulating in half that time. Of the cases he has collected, "no siege surpassed a period of 14 months." Stathakopoulos, Famine and Pestilence, 47. 96</page><page sequence="9">Opulence and Oblivion destruction of Jerusalem, this scene highlights three wealthy men whose patronage (could have) sustained Jerusalem. The symbolic names of the three men exemplify aspects of idealized patron age: abundant generosity, great wealth, powerful social connections, and an intimacy with God that can bring about miraculous rescue. Ben Kalba Savu'a satisfies every one who enters his home, even though they arrive as ravenous as starving dogs. Unlike the anonymous host, Ben Kalba Savu'a guarantees that all his guests leave satisfied. Ben Zizit Hakeset has powerful connections with Rome—his "seat5' (keset)(keset)(keset) can be found among the Roman elite and his zizit dangle from his seat cushion, visible markers of Jewish identity. In contrast to Bar Kamza, who breaks with the Jewish community in order to affiliate with Rome, Ben Zizit Hakeset main tains the ability to engage with Rome and remain loyal to Jerusalem. Nakdimon's name recalls a rain miracle which allows him to provide for festival pilgrims during a time of intense drought. While the Bavli Gittin narrative does not retell the full story of Nakdimon's name, the sugya references a talmudic legend that recounts Nakdimon's prowess as a bountiful provider and a man whose great inti־. macy with God allows him to call forth miracles.23 Yet despite their exemplary gifts and powerful connections, Jerusalem's patrons prove unable to protect the city. Famine occurs because "rebellious thugs" burn these gifts in a disastrous attempt to compel the people of Jerusalem to rise up and fight against the Roman army. Jerusalem starves because of rebels who refuse the rabbis' suggestion to nego tiate peace, not because of the Roman siege and not because of God. The tragedy of famine becomes even more acute because of its political, profoundly human cause. Marta bat Boethus: The Tragedy of Women in Famine The next scene in the sugya contrasts the profound but ultimately fruitless generosity of three patrons of Jerusalem with the frivolous selfishness of Marta bat Boethus, a wealthy woman who starves to death on the streets of Jerusalem. Marta was a well-known figure for rabbinic audiences; several rabbinic texts mention her by name, always in the context of sumptuous wealth. In the tannaitic corpus, Marta bat Boethus appears as a paradigmatic example of a rich widow,24 as 23. An explanation of Nakdimon's name appears in B. Ta'anit 19b-20a, after a tale that describes a crushing drought in Jerusalem, when the people are making a festival pilgrimage to the Temple. Nakdimon negotiates with a nobleman for the loan of twelve wells of water, promising to repay the water with rainfall before an appointed time. Late afternoon on the last day, Nakdimon enters the Temple and prays that God grant rain—reminding God that he made the pledge not for his own honor, but for the honor of God, so that the pilgrims would be able to fulfill their obligations. But the nobleman claims that the rain fell too late to fulfill Nakdimon's word, so Nakdimon reenters the Temple and pleads with God again. The sun pierces through the clouds—a miracle that the Bavli takes to reveal the intimate love between Nakdimon and his God. The conclusion of the narrative likens Nak dimon to Moses and Joshua, who also had miracles performed on their account. A foil discussion of this narrative will appear in my forthcoming book. 24. Sifrei Devarim reads: You shall not...take a widow's garment in pledge: whether rich or poor, even if she were [as rich as] Marta bat Boethus.

Bavli Gittin's Marta tale is one of many rabbinic stories that recount the poverty of once-illustrious daughters and use their desperate circumstances to exemplify the tragedy of destruction.27 Bavli Gittin recounts the tragic story of the last days of Marta bat Boethus, fashioning her into a symbol of pathos that embodies the misery and suffering of ruined Jerusalem: Marta the daughter of Boethus was the wealthiest woman in Jerusalem. She sent forth her agent and said to him, "Go and bring me bread of the finest flour from the market." While he was gone, it sold. He came and told her there was no fine flour, but white flour remained. "Go and bring it to me." While he was gone, it sold. He came and told her there was no white flour, but poor-grade flour remained. "Go and bring it to me." While he was gone, it sold. He came and told her that there was no poor-grade flour, but barley flour remained. "Go and bring it to me." While he was going, the barley sold. She took off her shoes and said, "I will go out and I will see. Perhaps I will find something to eat." She put her foot in excrement and died. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai applied to her the verse, "And she who is most tender and dainty among you [so tender and dainty that she would never venture to set a foot on the ground, shall begrudge the husband of her bosom and her son and her daughter the afterbirth that issues from between her legs and the babies she bears; she shall eat them secretly, because of utter want...]." (Deuteronomy 28:56) 25. M. Yevamot 6:4 rules that a high priest may not marry a widow, but that he may marry a widow whom he betrothed before he became high priest. The Mishnah uses Marta as an example of the latter case, writing "There was the case of Joshua ben Gamla who betrothed Marta bat Boethus and the king nominated him high priest and he took her to wife." 26. T. Kippurim 1:13-14 describes "the case of the sons of Marta bat Boethus." Tal llan regards this case as another situation that dramatizes the wealth and prominence of Marta and her sons.

For Rabbi Zadok sat and fasted for forty years, so that Jer usalem would not be destroyed. When he ate anything, it could be seen from the outside [because he was so thin.] When he was regaining strength, they brought him dried figs and he sucked them and threw them away. While she was dying, she brought out all the gold and silver that she had and threw it in the market. She said, "Aie—what has it brought me?" Thus it is written, "They shall throw their silver into the streets and their gold shall be treated as something unclean. [Their silver and gold shall not avail to save them in the day of the Lord's wrath—to satisfy their hunger or to fill their stomachs. Because [their beautiful adornments] made them stumble into guilt . . . (Ezekiel(Ezekiel 7:19)28 The Bavli characterizes Marta as a frivolous and selfish aristocrat, a woman who refuses to moderate her high-class tastes even in times of crisis.29 Marta's request for "finest flour" stands out as a culturally significant claim of elite status, reflect ing a common Mediterranean preference for white bread as a mark of high status.30 Rabbinic sources suggest that barley bread had particularly strong class associations—commonly treating it as food fit only for animals and for the poorest of the poor.31 Through intensely patterned language that dramatizes the exchange between Marta and her agent over the declining quality of bread, the Bavli highlights Marta's unwillingness to relinquish her high-class status. She holds out for the richest food her agent can find and thereby forfeits her oppor tunity to purchase anything at all. 28. B. Gittin 56a. 29. In this narrative, the Bavli seems to exhibit strong disapproval for the practice of sustaining the formerly wealthy poor according to their previous social status.

Marta takes off her shoes—thereby fulfilling the curse articulated in Deuteronomy 28:56, which describes the downfall of a woman so tender and dainty that she would never let her bare feet touch the ground.32 Other rabbinic texts use a similar association between wealthy women and protected feet to portray Marta as the ultimate aristocrat. Eikhah Rabbah describes Marta going to see her husband, the high priest, on the day of Yom Kippur.33 Even on the Day of Atonement, when one might expect an embrace of asceticism, Marta walks along carpets that were laid from the door of her house to the Temple, so that her feet never touch the ground. Bavli Gittin inverts this image of "pampered feet" to portray Marta's tragic end. Until the destruction of Jerusalem, Marta never exposes her bare, tender toes. By taking off her shoes, Marta enters into a direct encounter with the misery of of Jerusalem. According to one version of the story, she dies from the shock of stepping into excrement. Within rabbinic narrative, the association between once wealthy daughters and dung dramatizes the bitter change in the circumstances of these aristocratic women. In Bavli Ketubot 66b- 67a, for example, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai laments seeing the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion scavenge barley from the dung in horses' hooves. When she sees him, she covers herself up with her hair and begs for food—a narrative the Bavli uses to teach the importance of charity and to rebuke Nakdimon ben Gurion for not giving away enough of his fortune.34 But unlike the more common motif of women who search for grains in dung, Bavli Gittin's Marta does not scavenge. Instead, the Bavli uses the excre ment to highlight her delicacy and helplessness, emphasizing her inability to forage for food. She expires before she can seek out the nourishment that might be hidden in the midst of offal. Her tender flesh cannot withstand an unmediated encounter with feces on the streets of Jerusalem. In the second version of her death, Marta does forage—attempting to sustain herself on the cast-off figs that Rabbi Zadok used to sustain himself during his lengthy fast, when he sought to prevent the destruction of Jerusalem. Marta and Zadok experience profoundly different perceptions of crisis: Marta is the pinnacle of unknowing, the woman whose obliviousness to the siege propels her into an 32. Naomi G.

Eikhah Rabbah 1:47, to Lamentations 1:16 (ed. Buber, p. 86). The Leningrad manuscript gives the woman the name of "Marta." Printed editions read "Miriam." The names and stories of these two women are often interchanged in the literature. See Visotzky, "Most Tender and Fairest of Women." 34. The motif of women picking grains from dung appears widely: B. Ketubot 67a; T. Ketubot 5:9-10; Y. Ketubot 5:13 (30b-c); Eikhah Rabbah 1:48, to Lamentations 1: (ed. Buber, p. 86); Sifrei Devarim, Nizavim, pis. 305, to Deuteronomy 31:21 (ed.

In many cases, the sage who sees her is Rabbi 'El'azar ben Zadok. See extensive discussion of the relationship between these narratives in Visotzky, "Most Tender and Fairest of Women." 100</page><page sequence="13">Opulence and Oblivion arrogant, ignominious death. Zadok is the ultimate visionary, the one who fasted for forty years in anticipation of the crisis, long before others recognized the danger.35 Their divergent responses to the figs reveal a stark contrast between a rabbi fasting and a wealthy woman starving. Rabbinic fasts make deliberate use of a voluntarily weakened body to make visible the implicit threat of famine— revealing an awareness of human vulnerability and human culpability in the face of crisis.36 Rabbi Zadok's fasts script the looming catastrophe onto his flesh, rendering his body transparent; as the Bavli recounts, everything that goes inside him is visible from the outside. Despite the fast, his body remains pro foundly resilient. Like many pious rabbinic rabbis and wonder-workers, Rabbi Zadok proves able to survive on meager nourishment.37 While his body is wea kened, his ability to undertake the rigors of a forty-year fast signals a profound spiritual and physical discipline.38 While Rabbi Zadok is revivified by the juice of a few figs, Marta dies trying to draw sustenance from his husks.39 By contrast, the Bavli portrays Marta as highly sensitive—a vulnerable body that cannot bear contact with the grim reality of besieged Jerusalem. Marta's delicacy becomes her death sentence. Frivolity and Danger: Women's Wealth in Bavli Gittin's Narrative of Destruction Marta's story stands within a long history of representing crisis through womanhood, a tradition in which visual and textual images of women's bodies become icons of disaster.40 Marta's glorious wealth provides a backdrop against which the Bavli can narrate her spectacular fall. Anthony Saldarini suggests that 35. In B. Yoma 39a- b. the Bavli attributes significance to forty years before the destruction, associating it with signs and portents that prefigure the destruction. 36. See further discussion in my forthcoming book. 37. A famous example is Hanina ben Dosa, who is described as subsisting on a handful of carobs from week to week. In his study of poverty in Greco-Roman Palestine, Gildas Hamel notes that the fruits of the wild carob tree were considered a typical poor man's food and actually used pri marily as fodder for animals. The human consumption of carobs was synonymous with living in poverty. Hamel reads the rabbinic narratives of Hanina ben Dosa as well as Shim'on bar Yohai and his son, who lived for twelve years in a cave hiding from the Romans and eating carobs, to suggest that "only extraordinary individuals could subsist on so meager a food."

Drawing upon longstanding biblical metaphors that imagine Jerusalem as woman, Marta embodies both the glory and tragedy of city, nation, and people. The coupling of a devastated Jerusalem as a ruined woman appears most prominently in the book of Lamentations. For an analysis of rabbinic use of gender and destruction in Eikhah Rabbah, see Galit Hasan-Rokem, Web of Life: Folklore and MidrashMidrash in Rabbinic Literature (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), especially Chapter 6. I hope to explore the ethical implications of this trope of suffering women in detail in another paper. 101</page><page sequence="14">Julia Julia Julia Watts Belser the Babylonian Talmud uses Marta as a paradigm for the suffering and death among all Jerusalem's residents, positioning her as an extreme case that highlights the horror of the destruction. In Saldarini's view, Maria's wealth dramatizes the profundity of the crisis, revealing how the destruction brings suffering to all people, regardless of wealth.41 Marta's story clearly underscores a theological premise that wealth will not save a person from suffering. The narrative concludes with a sharp denunciation of wealth via the evocation of Ezekiel 7:19, and Marta's final words explicitly proclaim the uselessness of her riches. But the Bavli portrays Marta's wealth in a particularly negative light, contrasting Marta's frivolity with the generosity of Jerusalem's patrons and emphasizing the way in which her own destruction came about because she failed to use her wealth well. While Marta's final days are narrated in the context of famine, the Bavli emphasizes that the cause of her own death lies in her foolish unwillingness to relinquish her high-class desires. Marta begins the story in a position of consider able power, issuing precise instructions to her agent, setting the terms of her own purchase, and employing an agent to insulate herself from the risks of the market.42 But as the tale unfolds, the Bavli strips her of agency, neutralizing the utility of her wealth. By emphasizing the foolishness of her instructions, the Bavli positions Marta as the architect of her own doom. Had she used her wealth judiciously at the start of the crisis or instructed her agent to purchase what ever food he could find, Marta might have escaped disaster. While Marta began the tale as a woman who does not need to go out because she has a servant to shop on her behalf, she becomes a woman who should not go out because she cannot survive on her own. The discourse of women's risk binds women's possibilities. Marta's death on the streets of Jerusalem reinscribes images of female dependency and vulnerability, underscoring the harsh costs that upper-class women pay when they are exposed to danger. Through Marta's tale, the sugya crafts a striking contrast between a wealthy woman's frivolity and the patronage of three aristocratic men who seek to sustain Jerusalem. While each of these figures use wealth in a way that ultimately proves ineffective, the three men make a credible effort to deploy their riches for the good of of the community. They provide consumable gifts of grain, oil, wine, and wood— with the Bavli quick to point out that "the rabbis praised the wood" as necessary for feeding the people. Patronage is not out of the question for Marta; wealthy women did serve as patrons in late antiquity. Josephus portrays Queen Helene of Adiabene as a major patron of Jerusalem, recounting how she sent her servants out to secure grain from Alexandria and figs from Cyprus in order to relieve a 41.

Her wealth brings no benefit to the city or its populace. When she relinquishes her riches at the end of the tale, she throws silver and gold in the street. Even this final act of renuncia tion has no charitable purpose. With the bread gone from the market, what profit will her coins bring? The Dangers of Privilege: Wealth, Servitude, and Unknowing in Bavli Gittin Through the narrative of Marta bat Boethus, Bavli Gittin crystallizes a dis course of wealth as a physical and moral danger. By closing the tale with reference to Ezekiel 7:19, the Bavli uses Marta as fulfillment of a verse that prophesies a situation in which people will throw their silver into the streets, recognizing that wealth will neither save them from God,s wrath nor fill their hungry bellies. But Ezekiel 7:19 does not simply condemn the uselessness of wealth, it situates wealth as an active source of danger: the people's riches "caused them to stumble into guilt." By deploying this verse to conclude the Marta tale, Bavli Gittin emphasizes a link between wealth and moral danger. In purely sociological terms, the Bavli's connection between riches and risk is profoundly counterintui tive. Access to wealth provides immense material protection from the threat of famine. Poverty is a central factor in determining a person's likelihood of death through famine, and ancient sources testify to the disproportionate risks that dis aster and famine bring to people living in poverty 45 But the sugya's representation of the relationship between the master or mistress and the lower-status men who serve them reveals a critical awareness of the "risks" of economic dominance— and may shed oblique light on the corrosive power of systems of servitude and slavery slavery 46 Low-status, subordinate men play a critical role in driving the plot of the sugya. The Bar Kamza tale begins by attributing the destruction of the Temple to a servant's mistake, describing the disastrous chain of events that unfold when the host's servant (shamaeh) fetches his master's enemy instead of his friend. While the narrative gaze never returns to the servant's error, the entire plot is set in motion by his failure to follow precisely the master's instructions. In the Marta narrative, Bavli Gittin inverts the man's character flaw. As the tale recounts the obsessive back-and-forth from Marta's home to the market, the 43.

As Jeffrey Rubenstein notes, the confusion between Kamza and Bar Kamza stems from a servant's minute but disastrous deviation in his instruc tions—but Marta's death rests in part on her agent's unwillingness to compromise his charge.47 Marta's reliance on an agent also plays a critical role in fostering her own disastrous ignorance of besieged Jerusalem. Not only does extravagant wealth diminish Marta's physical capacity to grapple with the gritty realities of famine and war, her patrician status insulates her from an awareness of suffering in the streets of Jerusalem. While the Bavli makes no explicit critique of Marta's reliance upon an agent, the narrative dynamics suggest that her use of the agent veils her own awareness of the urgency of famine. Marta's use of the agent keeps her in the dark, obscures the realities of famine, and fosters the tragic obliv iousness that leads to her downfall. By accentuating the perils of wealth and the dangers that high status poses to elites, the Bavli diverts attention from the risks born by the underclass. In the talmudic narrative, Marta's agent goes for her into the gritty streets of Jerusalem—the streets that proved toxic to Marta's tender flesh. Her agent bears the risk of this encounter, a danger that goes entirely unspoken by the text. This silence likely stems from the rabbis' intensely gendered discourse about women and danger in the marketplace.48 Yet it also underscores a common tendency to overlook the ways that slavery, servitude, and other econ omically stratified labor systems force subordinates to bear risk by exposing lower-class bodies to danger.49 Celebration and Oblivion: Feasting and Slaughter on the King's Mountain Later in the sugya, the Bavli once again uses a feast narrative to draw critical attention to issues of opulence, danger, and oblivion to catastrophe. The story begins by evoking Rabbi Yohanan's original teaching that blames the destruction of Tur Malka (King's Mountain) on a rooster and a hen, once again recounting how a set of seemingly minor misunderstandings lead to disaster: Tur Malka was destroyed over a rooster and a hen. When they processed out with the bride and the groom, it was the custom to lead a rooster and a hen before them, so as to say: Be fruitful and multiply as the birds. A troop of Roman soldiers passed by and took [the birds] from them, so [the Jews] fell upon [the soldiers] and beat them. [The soldiers] went and told Caesar: "The Jews are rebelling against you!" and he came [to attack] them. 47. "If in the first scene the servant confuses his instructions and invites the wrong person, in this case the servant does nothing, leading to death.

Caesar took his crown and placed it on the earth. He said: "Lord of All the World, may it not please you to surrender me and my kingdom to the hand of a single man." Bar Droma was brought down on account of his mouth, for he said: "But You have rejected us, God. You do not march with our armies." (Psalm 60:12) But David also said this! David only wondered whether it was so. While [Bar Droma was] on the toilet, a snake came and tore out his intestines and he died. [Caesar] said, "Since a miracle was done for me, I will leave them alone this time." He left them alone and they rejoiced—they ate and they drank and they lit lamps so abundant that the seal of a signet ring could be seen for more than a mile. [Caesar] said: "The Jews are rejoicing greatly over me!" So he returned and came against them. R. Asi said: Three hundred thousand swordsmen ascended Tur Malka and [the swordsmen] slaughtered them there for three days and three nights, while on the other side of the mountain, they celebrated and made merry, and one side did not know about the other.50 According to the Tur Malka story, Jewish custom calls for communities to parade a rooster and a hen before a bride and groom on their wedding day to bring the new couple fertility. In the midst of this celebration, a troop of Roman soldiers snatch up the birds. The Jewish wedding guests mob the soldiers, who report to Caesar that the Jews are rebelling against imperial authority. Like the Bar Kamza story that began the sugya, the Tur Malka narrative rests on a critical mis understanding: the soldiers believe the Jews are rising up in revolt, but Jewish vio lence is actually a spontaneous response to the soldiers' desecration of a Jewish wedding custom. As with the rabbis' original refusal to sacrifice the blemished animal, the Bavli once again emphasizes that Roman elites see rebellion where none is intended. By framing the destruction as resulting from a tragic or foolish misunderstanding, the sugya provides what David Kraemer calls "a remarkably naturalistic explanation for the subsequent destructions."51 While Roman power is evident in both the destruction of the Temple and the brutal massacre on Tur Malka, the sugya also highlights Roman ignorance and the Roman emperor's vulnerability to misinformation. The Bar Kamza tale begins with a feast where a Jewish man is shamed by another Jew, turns informer, and then crafts an elaborate hoax with a blemished sacrifice that leads Caesar to think the Jews are rebelling against him. Caesar is vulnerable to Bar Kamza's machinations because he does not know the intricacies of Jewish sacrificial law or because he is duped by a treacherous informer. Set up by Bar Kamza's sabotage, Caesar regards the rabbis' unwillingness to sacrifice as an act of defiance and launches an unnecessaiy military campaign against the Jews. In the Tur Malka story, the feast is the final straw—not the first. Inverting the motif of the Jewish informer, the Tur Malka assault is first set in motion by Roman informants who 50. B. Gittin 57a. 51. Kraemer, Responses to Suffering, 181. 105</page><page sequence="18">Julia Julia Watts Belser give poor counsel because they fail to recognize their own culpability for causing violence. The soldiers' ignorance of Jewish customs leads them to mistake a wedding mob for an actual Jewish revolt and prompts another needless military action that nearly results in Caesar's destruction. Once again, subordinate men lead elites into error. The narrative telescopes the conflict between Rome and the Jews to an engagement between two men: Bar Droma, the Jewish hero whose physical prowess allows him to kill the Roman forces; and Caesar, who pleads with God to avoid being subjected to the hand of this one man. The Bavli's account links Caesar's ultimate victory with his humble stance before God, while connecting Bar Droma's downfall with his blasphemous claim (via Psalm 60:12) that God has rejected the people of Israel and does not march with their armies. The Bavli describes Bar Droma's brutal and ignominious end, narrating how a snake came upon him while he was in the privy and tore out his intestines. Caesar inter prets Bar Droma's death as a miracle performed on his behalf and decides to leave the Jews alone.52 When Caesar withdraws, the Jews rejoice with a great feast— and the opulence of their celebration prompts Caesar to return and annihilate them. Through this image of the provocative feast, the Tur Malka story again dramatizes the dangerous repercussions of a banquet, linking the elaborate display of wealth with destructive emotions of anger or shame. The final lines of the Tur Malka tale give haunting voice to the revelers' ignorance of the disaster unfolding just beyond their borders. Caught up in the extravagant celebration, half the people of Tur Malka feast in the midst of disas ter—unaware of the brutal violence Caesar deploys on the other side of the moun tain. With its description of the lavish lights that mark this feast, the Bavli once again emphasizes that wealth obscures the realities of war, famine, and crisis. The Bavli pays particular attention to the extravagance of the Jewish victory banquet, describing how "they ate and they drank and they lit lamps so abundant that the seal of a signet ring" could be seen at a great distance. Though the lights of the feast illuminate the seal by which an elite man might mark his identity, the same lamps veil the brutalities of suffering. Despite (or perhaps because of) those glorious torches with their exuberant light, nothing illuminates the murders beyond their sight lines. With their attention fixated on the luxuries of the feast, the partygoers never glimpse the violence on the other side of the mountain. Through its tales of feasting and famine, Bavli Gittin's sugya on destruction calls attention to the ethical cost of elite status—highlighting the physical and moral dangers of social privilege. In the story of Bar Kamza, the Bavli casts a criti cal eye on the social politics of elite banquets, dramatizing how a host and guest's personal intrigues over status and shame endanger an entire community. By linking Bar Kamza's treachery with the public humiliation of his expulsion 52.52. This remark echoes an important moment earlier in the sugya, when Rabbi Yohanan is rebuked for failing to ask Vespasian to withdraw from the city and spare Jerusalem. See Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, 356 n. 72. 106</page><page sequence="19">Opulence and Oblivion from the feast, the sugya casts negative light on the great lengths to which elites might go to preserve their own status or avenge its loss. Seething with the indig nity of his exclusion from the host's banquet, Bar Kamza aligns himself with Roman power and turns informer for a taste of the emperor's bread. In the story of Marta bat Boethus, the Bavli portrays the tragic downfall of an aristocratic woman as a consequence of her foolish unwillingness to forgo her taste for luxury. By linking Marta's wealth with frivolous desire in the midst of crisis, the sugya suggests that social privilege insulates her from the reality of suffering, leaving her unable to accurately perceive the gravity of the situation. While the Bavli uses the Marta tale to articulate a gendered critique of elite women's frivolity that contrasts sharply with the generous provision of wealthy male patrons and visionary fasting rabbis, the sugya's final feasting tale extends the Bavli's concern more broadly to encompass the moral danger of extravagance. Through the tale of Tur Malka, the Bavli intertwines opulence with oblivion: the bright lights that illuminate the lavish feast black out the violence on the other side of the mountain, leaving the revelers unable to see the cost of luxury. , Julia Watts Belser Georgetown University Washington, D.C. 107</page></plain_text>
