<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Chernick. Gezerah Shavah: Its Various Forms in Midrashic and Talmudic Sources. Lod: Haberman Institute for Literary Research, 1994. 274 pp. (Hebrew). The term gezerah shavah refers to one of the hermeneutic rules by which the ancient rabbis were able to derive details of a scriptural law that were not specified in the text in which the law was set down. The rule was applied in cases where two scriptural passages shared a common framework and vocabulary; in such instances, one might deduce that what was said in one passage also applied to the law in the other passage. For example, Scripture uses the term bemo'ado ("at its appointed time") to indicate the time of the Passover sacrifice. The same term is also used for the daily tamid offering. Bemo'ado is not defined in the passage about the Passover sacrifice, but its meaning can be deduced by reference to what is said about the tamid. Scripture explicitly states that the tamid offering is to take place at its appointed time every day and even on the Sabbath. This definition, explicitly operative in the description of the tamid offering (the "parent" law), is analogously posited to describe the Passover sacrifice (the "orphaned" law), where the term bemo'ado also occurs and is now seen to imply "even on the Sabbath." Since this term is utilized only in the tamid and Passover passages, only these sacrifices, and no others, have scriptural warrant to push away the Sabbath.</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS The Talmud points out that this particular example of reading the context of one scriptural law to apply to another is not unassailable, and that received statements about practice are more reliable indicators of proper law than this gezerah shavah. The gezerah shavah of bemo'ado is said to date from the first century B.C.E. and to have been used by Hillel, the Pharisee. Thus the gezerah shavah is attributed to the earliest layers of rabbinic exegesis as an inheritance from the Pharisees. Michael Chernick's goal in this volume is to describe the techniques of this principle and to examine their varying usages in the various strata of the documents which house them. Technical works like this one illustrate historical development in the use of rabbinic forms, styles, and language. They are most important to scholars of Talmud and Midrash, for they provide the keys to unlocking such questions as how to date various layers in the literature and how to evaluate its editorial processes. Unfortunately, only a handful of scholars who study postbiblical Judaism work in areas appreciably close to Chernick's discipline. The vast majority work in areas which demand less investment in the tedious minutiae of talmudic legal hermeneutics. His work is far removed from the popular "faddy," creative, imaginative books in vogue today. Yet ultimately all scholarly work in rabbinic literature must engage the hermeneutic rules of the rabbis if it is to be credible. The careful reader will find that Chernick provides a good introduction to the several types of gezerah shavah. Some of his "scientific" findings have to be considered with much caution and skepticism, and in the end will probably not be of use to those who are looking for quick keys to date or classify material. I remain unconvinced that he has broken new ground in his own work over what others have done in the past. What he has done well, and this is a major achievement, is to summarize and explicate in a clear, concise fashion the hermeneutic rationales behind gezerah shavah. They are, he shows, neither as arbitrary nor as mystifying as might at first appear to be the case. Serious scholars in the field of rabbinics will learn a great deal from this book by looking at the materials Chernick has assembled and the way he has assembled them. The work is more mature than his earlier Hermeneutical Studies in Talmudic and Midrashic Literatures (Tel Aviv, 1984), in Hebrew, which is still useful after ten years. We shall now consider his presentation from the standpoint of what readers can expect to find in the book. The first thing they will want to know is what assumptions feed his work. They must know this so that when they come to test materials by his standards, they do not simply discern as their</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 161 own finding what he has already programmed in as an assumption. Then they will want to know what framework he imposes on his material, and whether it is the best framework by which to understand the materials he studies. Third, they will want to know whether they can trust that his examples tell them what he says they do. We should therefore indicate what he has done, why he has done it, and how accurately he has done it. Chernick convincingly types the various controlling factors which induced gezerah shavah techniques in the tannaitic period (prior to 200 C.E.). He delineates these factors into three "simple-integral" ones associated with Rabbi Akiba and his school, and three "elaborate-dispensable" ones associated with Rabbi Yishmael and his school (e.g., blatantly redundant words in the orphan law trigger the search to look elsewhere for a parent text). In all cases some hierarchy of procedure dictates only one good choice of word-pairing between the two laws. The more uniquely similar the literary settings, the higher the priority for choosing a particular law as the parent of a particular orphaned law. Chernick cites literature that suggests why in some comparisons only one detail from the parent is applied, while in others more or even all details are applied to the orphan. He is well aware of the expanding and limiting factors which discipline the applications of the hermeneutic. These categorizations, accompanied by illustrations and explanations of the tight rules, form the strongest part of Chernick's work and commend the book to all who would understand the fixed logic behind the rules of tannaitic or early rabbinic gezerah shavah. As a result of this analysis, he corroborates that there are not only full-fledged forms explicitly called gezerah shavah but formalized word comparisons that are later called gezerah shavah but perhaps only for convenience. Chernick says that his work is an advance over previous scholarship because he can utilize the consensus of modern scholars on three counts that improve the understanding of this hermeneutic principle. 1. He maintains that the amoraim developed the gezerah shavah beyond the tight controls of the tannaim until they had to admit that matters were getting out of hand and no more pseudo-gezerah shavah arguments should be produced, although older ones could be repeated. In actuality Chernick shows us that what the tannaim used as an unnamed form of exegesis the amoraim assimilated to the term gezerah shavah. The medieval scholars, he says, already recognized the amoraic quasi-gezerah shavah as deficient and not the full-fledged kind of the tannaim. However, only a semantic change occurred, not a substantive one. Form A and form</page><page sequence="4">162 BOOK REVIEWS B are tannaitic in substance. One type was named gezerah shavah, and there was a cousin type that had no name. Then later teachers simply called the two formally related but separate hermeneutic strategies by the same name. Thus the application of terminology of the early hermeneutic would have changed, but the substance of the arguments remained the same. The amoraim did not necessarily invent a new form of hermeneutic, they appear to have enlarged the use of the label. We might even wonder whether there is any hard proof that such labels were not used by tannaim themselves, or is the argument one from silence alone? Chernick's claim to have shown development of gezerah shavah usage may be said to refer to semantic innovations. His claim that he has located new amoraic hermeneutic forms is much less certain. 2. Chernick begins by telling us that his work advances beyond earlier work because we now "know" that the composer (or stam) of the anonymous frame of the Talmud is post-amoraic, and we can isolate the period as one of new development of the gezerah shavah technique. Subsequently, Chernick simply says that their method was the same as that of the later amoraim in that they had a wide terminology for what they called gezerah shavah. It turns out that it is irrelevant for his purposes whether they are a later stratum than the amoraic or the same stratum. He indicates no substantial difference in hermeneutic in these putative strata. 3. Chernick claims that his work is an advance because he can utilize the consensus that Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiba had different schools and utilized different terminologies and different exegetical techniques. It is true that the Talmudim and Midrashim, as well as all the commentators, are well aware of the two schools, and that modern scholarship has tried to identify which works emanate from one school and which from the other. Chernick introduces some sophistication in his discussion of the schools but at times leaves us bewildered. For example, on page 27 he cites Sifra and Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai to the effect that Rabbi Yishmael drew analogies between "resident" and "hired worker" in regard to Passover laws and heave-offering laws. In essence Rabbi Yishmael argues that just as the law forbade an uncircumcised person to eat of the Passover offering (the parent law), so the similar wording intends to forbid an uncircumcised priest from eating of the heave offering (the orphaned law). Apparently on the grounds that modern scholarship attributes Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai and Sifra to the Akiban school, Chernick believes this gezerah shavah to be from Rabbi Akiba even though it is reported in the name of Rabbi Yishmael in these works. Chernick insists that there is no hint of</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 163 the "elaborate-dispensable" technique that characterizes the actual gezerah shavah arguments of the school of Rabbi Yishmael. Rather, he asserts, the argument is of the "simple-integral" type that is typical of Rabbi Akiba. This claim cannot stand. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Yishmael and both Talmudim, at the beginning of the eighth chapter of Yevamot, explain that this must be the "elaborate-dispensable" type of gezerah shavah. The Bavli and the Mekhilta of Rabbi Yishmael record this in the name of Rabbi Eliezer; the Yerushalmi, Sifra, and Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai record it in the name of Rabbi Yishmael. Whatever tradent we choose, whatever corpus we consider, there is explicit indication in the sources that we are dealing with Yishmaelian "elaborate-dispensable" hermeneutics. Not only that but more. Both Talmudim know that Rabbi Akiba explicitly argued against utilizing gezerah shavah here. There is no room at all to claim it as Akiban. Chemick deals with the same tradition fifty pages later. On page 79 he cites this very gezerah shavah but this time from Mekhilta Rabbi Yishmael. Although the midrash is the same, he notes here that it is indeed of the "elaborate-dispensable" variety, since this is, of course, what we can expect to find in the Mekhilta from the School of Rabbi Yishmael. Yes, after all is said and done, the same gezerah shavah is Yishmaelian and follows his rules for gezerah shavah. Chernick provides a footnote here that refers us back to page 27. I have no way of explaining the contradiction of why he asserts on page 27 that this gezerah shavah (when found in Sifra and Mekhilta RaShb"Y) is Akiban in every way and on page 79 that (when found in Mekhilta R"Y) it is Yishmaelian. Perhaps the way in which moderns describe the history of a corpus (Sifra and Mekhilta RaShb"Y are said to be Akiban, Mekhilta R"Y to be Yishmaelian) tells Chernick how to understand everything in it. If so he has trained his mind to look through foggy theories and ignore clear facts. This I rather doubt, and the puzzle remains. I do raise the flag of caution regarding his theories of development. Let the reader beware. In relation to his reliance on general theory without examining cases individually, one further cautionary note must be sounded. Since Chernick nowhere provides us with the total number of possibilities of a phenomenon upon which he collects data (I should think it impossible to do), his gathering of frequency of occurrences tells us nothing. We must know not only how many, but how many out of a total possible number. A sample of 1 might mean 100 percent if there was only one possible case, while a sample of 100 might mean 1 percent if there were 10,000 possible cases. Only the view of relative occurrences in the two Mekhiltas can be taken as significant, since</page><page sequence="6">164 BOOK REVIEWS there the total pool will be the same; they analyze the very same verses of Scripture. Since Chernick categorically believes that the types of midrashim in one Mekhilta are Akiban and in the other Yishmaelian, he does not correlate them in any comparative way. At any rate, I doubt that much of value could be gained by knowing accurate, statistical distributions of gezerah shavah. These caveats need not deter anyone from tasting the rich array of materials Chernick shows us. We look forward to future works by the author collecting and analyzing samples of rabbinic hermeneutic.
