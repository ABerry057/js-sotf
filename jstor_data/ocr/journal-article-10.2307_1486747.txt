Chicago Studies in the History of Judaism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. 303 pp. Orthodox Judaism is diverse. No matter how unified Orthodoxy appears to ,outsiders, multiple views on critical issues abound, separating Orthodox Jews into movements that alternately coalesce, ignore, and battle each other. Followers of the teachings of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, who spearheaded Jewish settlement in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, insist that the State of Israel embodies Messianic redemption. Satmarer Hasidim and their allies in the Neturei Qarta and the Edah Haredit in Jerusalem see the Satan's hand in Israel's formation and subsequent political and military victories. The leaders of the Agudat Israel movement have devised an ideology that declares Jewish life in the State of Israel, governed as it is by secular Jews, to be exile, and devalues Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel. Viewing itself as the embodiment of the Jewish people and its now-deceased Rebbe, Menachem Schneerson, as potentially the Messiah, Habad Hasidism forbids the Israel Defense Forces from handing any of the Holy Land to non-Jews. These movements articulate the overlap of theological and political cleavages within Orthodox Jewry. Aviezer Ravitsky, professor of Jewish thought at the Hebrew University, offers a fascinating account of these ideological positions. The volume details the competing views, offering the reader a window into Orthodox Judaism as it has developed since the Holocaust and the formation of the State of Israel. The volume abounds in insightful analyses of particular rabbis, including elaborate and original studies of Rav Avraham Yitzhak Kook, Rabbi Yo'el Teitelbaum, the previous Satmarer Rebbe, and Rabbi Schneerson of Habad. The analysis of Rav Zvi Yehuda Kook and his disciples elucidates a worldview that has been accused of fostering violent opposition to the State of Israel. As important, the study exposes the rabbis' claim that they are the rightful leaders of the Jewish people. Ravitsky offers a model of how to combine the insider's knowledge of Orthodoxy with intellectual history. The rise of the State of Israel, Ravitsky maintains, demanded ideological and theological meaning. Indeed, the successes of the Zionist movement in power produced a radical response by the ideologues of Orthodoxy. "In short, the religious mind found it difficult to view Zionism and messianism as two unrelated, parallel phenomena" (p. 38). He uses this theme to categorize the ideological responses and to justify the choice of movements to be examined,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 137 leading him to focus exclusively on radical ideological and political responses. Even so, the selections are not adequately justified. There is no discussion of the writings of Rav Shlomo Goren, a Chief Rabbi and a central figure in the development of radical religious positions in the aftermath of the Six-Day War; nor is there an analysis of Rabbi Meir Kahane and the Kach movement. Absent too are the pronouncements of Israel's Chief Rabbinate (a Zionist institution that did not become a movement) and the works of Rabbi Joseph Ber Soleveitchik, the leader of Modem Orthodoxy (albeit in the United States), who retained his Zionist principles without becoming messianic, to mention but two of many alternative formations and thinkers within Orthodoxy. Consider also Ravitsky's reasons for not examining the Shas movement: It has an ethnic social base (p. 165); the halakhic and political authority, Rav Ovadia Yosef, "takes a rather independent, ad hoc position" (p. 208); and Shas is a moderate movement. Certainly, the anti-Zionists and the Agudah also depend primarily on Jews of a particular ethnic origin, and few of the Gush Emunim are Sephardim. More important for a study of ideologies, the analysis of religious radicalism would have benefited from an examination of the contrasting positions: religious moderation and ideological flexibility within Orthodoxy. Finally and directly relevant to a study of religious movements, Ravitsky does not examine the large numbers of Orthodox Jews who do not grapple with the theological and messianic implications of the State, implicitly affirming the positions of Rabbi Jacob Reines, the founder of the Mizrachi movement (see p. 34). No matter the visibility and political significance of the four positions studied, they do not adequately cover the world of Orthodox Judaism. Ravitsky offers a confusing analysis of the theological and political implications of the "three oaths." Two oaths taken by the Jews--not to "ascend the wall" (interpreted as a prohibition on mass aliyah) and not to "rebel against the nations"; and a third, offered by the nations-"not [to] oppress Israel overly much" (p. 212, citing a passage in the Talmud [Ketubbot 101a])-seem to prohibit a sovereign Jewish state in Israel. By establishing the three oaths as a theme in the book's introduction, and by presenting an analysis of the oaths as an afterword that stands in place of a concluding chapter, Ravitsky emphasizes their centrality. At the same time, he recognizes that no classical sources and hardly any thinkers have treated them as binding halakhic pronouncements, as principles of Orthodoxy. As such, Ravitsky does not show that the oaths serve as useful analytic points against which to understand the development of Orthodox religious thought.</page><page sequence="3">138 BOOK REVIEWS Intellectual history by itself can serve as a starting point in the analysis of religious movements. Offering a detailed presentation of the views of Orthodox leaders, Ravitsky depicts some of the multiple ideologies that define contemporary Orthodoxy. The analysis omits much of the social and political context that surrounds the movements and the competition among the movements; it pays scant attention to the Jews who make up the world of Orthodox Jewry. It offers a world of knowledge that will aid future analyses. Alan S. Zuckerman Brown University Providence, R.I.</page></plain_text>
