Usually groundbreaking studies of this kind try to cover the entire field and end up being rather thin on in-depth analysis. Not so here, for remarkably, Berger manages both to introduce us to all the major figures and to offer incisive discussions of their works. Berger's previous book, Crisis and Covenant: The Holocaust in American Jewish Fiction (SUNY Press, 1985), deals with the works of such American classics as Saul Bellow, I. B. Singer, Elie Wiesel, Bernard Malamud, and Cyn- thia Ozick. This book and Lillian Kremer's Witness Through the Imagination: Jewish American Holocaust Literature (Wayne State University Press, 1989) are to date the most comprehensive studies of a generally overlooked aspect of modern American literature. While Kremer divides up the field by authors, Berger presents the works through the prism of thematic categories. Thus, Berger's analysis of literary responses to the Shoah is found under these headings: "Judaism as a Religious Value System," "Judaism as a Secular Value System," and "Symbolic Judaism." In Children of Job, Alan Berger studies writings, documentaries, and docudramas by second-generation artists whose work, according to Berger, falls under one of two overarching themes: "Jewish Particularism" or "Jewish Universalism." Among the writers discussed we find Art Spiegelman, whose Maus, the two-volume cartoon-drawn narrative of living with survivor parents, brought him instant celebrity status, as well as lesser-known though equally talented writers like Melvin Bukiet, Thomas Friedman, Lev Raphael, and Thane Rosenbaum. In Berger's scheme, "Jewish Particularism" means that certain second- generation writers are "wrestling with the meaning of Jewish identity after Auschwitz in terms of both the Holocaust's psychological effect on their lives and its theological impact. The psychological effect is seen in a variety of frequently contradictory ways. For example, as adolescents, the second generation both rebel against and identify with their parents' victimization. There appears to be guilt for not having been in the Holocaust and denial that the Shoah has any bearing on their identity" (p. 35). Thomas Friedman's novel Damaged Goods (1984), Bukiet's collection of short stories, While the Messiah Tarries (1995), and Spiegelman's Maus I &amp; II (1986, 1991) are three "particularist" narratives that Berger examines in detail. In all of them, major characters who are children of survivors are trying desperately to carve out an existence in families possessed by dark memories, guilt, and ambivalence about God and humanity. In lucidly</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 421 written, jargon-free style, Berger analyzes these writers' handling of the complex parent-child relationship, especially as it affects the question of legacy, the concern with the continuation of bearing witness to a past that is integral to these "children of Job" although they are foreign to it. To bolster his arguments, Berger engages a distinguished group of sociologists and psychologists-Aaron Hass, Robert J. Lifton, William Helmreich, Eva Fogelman, and Helen Epstein-whose studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the lives of Holocaust survivors and their children who live in America. While the "particularists" focus primarily on issues of post-Holocaust identity, family relations, and theological rebellion, "Jewish universalists" set these concerns in the context of "articulating the broader societal implications of antisemitism and the Shoah" (p. 88) In other words, these artists would like to appropriate the lessons of the Shoah to tikkun olam--combating racial, ethnic, or religious hatred, fighting all forms of prejudice, wherever they may occur. Carol Ascher, Julie Salamon, and Lev Raphael are some of the writers examined by Berger in this chapter. Children of Job deals mainly with American writers and filmmakers, but the production of Holocaust-related art by second-generation artists is a world phenomenon. In fact, in a New York Times article, "For the Holocaust's 'Second Generation,' an Artistic Quest" (Dec. 23, 1997), Dinitia Smith mentions the work of Israeli rock stars Yehuda Poliker and Shlomo Artzi, singers who have incorporated their parents' experiences into their music and films. Smith also interviewed Deb Filler, a Canadian stand-up comedian, whose "Punch me in the Stomach" is a series of comic monologues about family and friends who, one way or another, have been touched by the horrible events in Europe. No doubt, as the remaining survivors draw near the inevitable end, increasing numbers of second-generation writers will emerge to tell stories like those covered by Berger. These are not easy stories to write, since their creation involves a great deal of guilt, ambivalence, and inadequacy. Aren't all stories about parents like this? Kal vachomer here, where in addition to parent-child issues, these children find themselves in the difficult role of sustaining the voice of witnesses to the worst disaster in Jewish history, and to this waning century's most horrible crime.
