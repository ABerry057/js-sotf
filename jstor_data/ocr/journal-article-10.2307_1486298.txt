<plain_text><page sequence="1">"MEETING IN JERUSALEM": MESSIANIC EXPECTATIONS IN THE LETTERS OF THE CAIRO GENIZA by SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, New Jersey To Gershom Scholem With the sure touch of the true historian (a rare gift) Gershom Scholem has opened up for us new avenues toward the understanding of Jewish messianism and, in particular, its most fateful manifestation after the catas- trophic Bar Kokhba revolt: Sabbatianism. There are no pseudomessiahs, he teaches us. For any attempt to translate the idea of messianism into reality is doomed to end in failure, but failure is not its end. This is demonstrated by the movement connected with Sabbatai $evi, or, if one may associate two such incongruous phenomena, the death of Christ on the cross. The relationship between Kabbalah and messianism has occupied Scholem's mind throughout almost his entire scientific career. Naturally, the results of his research on the subject are embedded in his major works. The relevant papers included in his volume, The Messianic Idea in Judaism and Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality, provide a convenient introduction to his thought on the matter and permit also a glimpse into his workshop, I 43</page><page sequence="2">44 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN mean, how he proceeded to ever wider views and adopted ever stricter and bolder formulations.' Scholem is somewhat impatient with what he calls "laymen's messian- ism," that is, persons who did not belong to the circles of Jewish religious scholarship, but tried to do something to bring about "the end of days." This attitude of the master is understandable. Those self-appointed medieval messiahs or harbingers of good tidings have left us no writings; we learn about them from the accounts of members of the Jewish establish- ment, who mostly did not take them seriously, or from non-Jewish sources, whose information was necessarily limited. Thus the nature of their spiritu- ality, the matter in which Scholem is mainly interested, escapes us. In the concluding section of this article a story from the Geniza about a "lay- men's" messianic stirring is discussed, in which the narrator, who partici- pated in the event, transforms failure into success by demonstrating that "signs" of messianic times had indeed been apparent. The main purpose of this paper is an enquiry into the question of how far an awareness of the messianic syndrome was present in the minds of ordi- nary people during what I call the "classical" Geniza period, approximately the centuries between Saadya Gaon (d. 942) and the son of Moses Mai- monides, Abraham ha-Nagid (d. 1237). That was the time when classical Judaism in all its manifestations took final form; consequently, attitudes apparent in the day-to-day correspondence preserved from that period are not without interest for the knowledge of its spirituality. The opening of an important business letter, sent on March 5, 1026 from al-Ahwiz in south-western Iran to the capital of Egypt, contains this passage: "God knows the strength of my longing for you-may He always sup- port you. I ask Him to bring us together when His holy city will be built." The letter was addressed to the three senior Tustari brothers, prominent Karaites, resident in the capital of Egypt. I assume that the senders were Karaites as well.2 1. The Messianic Idea in Judaism and Other Essays in Jewish Spirituality (New York, 1971). Attention is drawn to David J. Biale, "The Demonic in History: Gershom Scholem and the Revision of Jewish Historiography" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, 1977), and, in parti- cular, to chapter 7: "Apocalyptic Messianism," pp. 249-86. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky's short, but penetrating paper "Messianism in Jewish History," in Jewish Society through the Ages, ed. H. H. Ben-Sasson and Shmuel Ettinger (New York, 1971), is recommended as an introduction to the subject. 2. Edited in S. D.

Isma'il (=Samuel), opens a business missive with the wish: "May God unite us soon in his holy city, He can be relied upon for this and He has the power for achieving it." Accord- ing to the products sent (1,000 pounds of shelled almonds and 50 pounds of Sicilian silk) the letter was sent from Sicily.3 Of particular interest is a letter from Sfisa, Tunisia, where, after the destruction of Qayrawan by bedouin hordes in 1057, the refugees, including the great Rabbenu Nissim b. Jacob, had found a temporary shelter. The writer, Labrat b. Moses Ibn Sighmdr (later dayyan in al-Mahdiyya, which replaced Qayrawan as the capital) describes the situation of the refugees as hopeless: "death is preferable to life" (Jeremiah 8:3), we "long for death, and it does not come" (Job 3:21), but goes on to write eighty long lines on a great variety of business and family matters. The addressee, his younger brother Judah, whom Labrat had brought up (probably because of the early death of their father) and for whom he harbored tender feelings (as did Moses Maimonides for his brother David), was later to become a great mer- chant and renowned philanthrophist in Egypt.4 On 11. 30-38 Labrat con- gratulates Judah on his marriage, excuses himself that, because of the state of his mind, he was unable to write to Judah's father- and brother-in-law, clearly personally known to him, and admonishes Judah to accept his mother-in-law as a substitute for his own mother (whose death is reported in the same letter) and his father-in-law as a replacement for himself, who had been to him like a father. He concludes: "I am writing this letter, over- whelmed by tears, for this is a separation for lifetime, and here I have no one on whom I can rely and with whom I can share my sorrow and my joy. I ask God to unite us soon in his holy city, if God will."' It was customary in merchants' families that one member, mostly a sanctuary," but now prefer "holy city." Even Heb. beit ha-miqdash could be understood in those days as meaning Jerusalem.

Labrdt and Judah (like later Moses and David Maimonides) had divided the family business between themselves in such a way. Judah had already been on a business trip from Qayrawin to Egypt in the summer of 1048, about ten years prior to the writing of that letter.6 Now that through his marriage he had become, so to say, a member of another firm, there was little likelihood that the two brothers would see each other again. Only a miracle, such as the ingathering of the exiled to the Holy City, could achieve this. In the first two examples provided above, the messianic reference might have had a similar meaning. Deserts in one case and the Mediterranean Sea in the other separated the senders of the letters from the recipients. To be sure merchants were very mobile in those days. But for some reason or another, such as old age, the correspondents might have not expected to meet again. At first blush it appears somewhat awkward, when a man in Yemen, who remarks in another letter that he used to visit Aden only once a month, writes to Halfon b. Nathanel, a renowned India traveler, who sojourned in that south-Arabian port. "May God privilege me to meet you in the courtyards of the Temple in Jerusalem." The long letter shows that Halfon and the writer knew each other personally and had many interests, communal, busi- ness, religious, and scientific, in common. However, that Yemenite had great veneration for the Holy Land and seemingly wished to be buried there, for "its soil atones for its people" (Deuteronomy 32:43.) The letter to Halfon was written in the 1130s, during which Halfon frequented Aden.' A more substantial hope for the restoration of Jerusalem is expressed in this passage of a letter sent from Old Cairo to Alexandria by the school- teacher, cantor, court clerk, and bookseller Solomon, son of the judge (and former physician) Elijah b. Zechariah, a prominent member of Abraham 6. TS 20.69v, 1. 27, where he is referred to by his Arabic designation Abat Zikri Ibn Sighmir. 7.

May He not let me die in this place, but unite us in our city where we will be safe, joyful, and happy with one another. May He do so for the sake of His venerable, awesome name, as it is written: 'Even when your exiled are at the ends of the sky, from there the Lord your God will gather you and from there He will fetch you'" (Deuteronomy 30:4). During his childhood Solomon had lived in Jerusalem. His eldest brother Abfi Zikri was physician in attendance to the Ayyubid Sultan Muwaffar, who, in 1219, dreading a Crusaders' attack, laid Jerusalem waste. At the writing of this letter, Jerusalem, with the exception of the Temple area and the Holy Sepulcher, was practically uninhabited. Why should it not be filled soon with the ingathered of Israel?8 Solomon's messianic outburst was induced by a remark made in the pre- ceding line, that a relative was coming to stay with him over Passover. Any mentioning of a holiday required a good wish, usually paired with the expression of messianic hopes. The standard wish was: "May God grant you many years in happiness and joy, and may He grant you to behold the beauty of the Lord and to visit His Temple (Psalms 27:4)."9 Since in ancient times a Jewish man was required "to appear before God" on a holiday, the addressee was wished the same privilege during his lifetime. This wish was expressed in many different forms, often in rhymed Hebrew prose. A com- monplace judicial report sent from a small town to the future Nagid Mevo- rakh b. Saadya, at a time when he still was a kind of president of the supreme court for his elder brother, the Nagid Judah (in the 1060s), ends with good wishes for holidays: "And may He bring us and you and all Israel together to His sanctuary [meaning Jerusalem], when His congregation will be assembled and His Temple renovated."'0 Each of the holidays had, in addition to the general wish, just discussed, a specific one, mostly connected with the Temple service, on Passover, of course, the wish to partake in the sacrifice of the Passover lamb and other 8.

The wish for Shavuot is a combination of Numbers 14:14, referring to the revelation on Mount Sinai, and Isaiah 52:10, God's return to Zion, as for instance in this fragment writ- ten in large letters: "May you be granted to see the Messiah, son of David, and to behold the Presence of God face to face, as it is written, etc."'2 Hanukkah and Purim, which in their liturgy are described as days of miracles, were rated in the miracle-ridden world of the Geniza far higher than in Ashkenazi Judaism of yesteryear. Both were described as holidays, '[d in Arabic, mo'ed in Hebrew, and as "noble days," the same expression as used for the most holy days of the month of Tishri.'3 One sent special letters of congratulation. The standard wish was: "He who wrought miracles for our fathers in these days, may do the like for me and you and all Israel."l4 Occasionally it was modified and enlarged to fill an entire letter, compris- ing ideas about exile and redemption, or wishing the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy on the new heaven and new earth (66:22).15 On Hanukkah one traveled to stay with relatives or friends, as one did for Passover, or the Day of Atonement, and one would celebrate Purim in Jawjar, a town whose synagogue, named after Elijah, the harbinger of redemption, was a goal of pilgrimage.'6 It is almost needless to say that letters and poems of congratulation 11.

In another letter of congratulation for a holiday TS 20.78, Meshullam is wished (by a dayyan, son of a "great rav") success, welfare, and a prominent position.

When a Gaon or Nagid, that is, the head of the Jewish community at large, was addressed or referred to, it was wished that his leadership should endure until "Salvation," or "the Redeemer," or "the Teacher of Righteous- ness" would come. His authority, so to say, was temporary and derived from the real one whose appearance was expected.'8 Salvation, yeshu'ah, was the technical term for messianic times, a usage foreshadowed through- out the books of Isaiah and the Psalms and confirmed in the second benedic- tion of the 'amidah, the daily prayer. In its Palestinian version, the one in use in the Geniza synagogue, the benediction had this form: "May He let Salva- tion sprout as quickly as the blinking of an eye," that is, with miraculous suddenness. How seriously this attitude was taken might be concluded from the way in which the Geonim, responding in kind, signed their letters. Extended phrases were impracticable. The Gaon and nasi (member of the family of the Exilarch) Daniel b. Azaryah, head of the Jerusalem yeshiva (1052-1063), signed with one word: yeshu'ah, "Salvation." Hay Gaon of Baghdad (d. 1038) and his younger contemporary Solomon, Gaon of Jerusalem (d. 1051), signed: yesha' ray, "Complete Salvation"; Solomon's predecessor, and later also his own son Abraham: yesha' yubash "may Salvation be soon." Lesser dignitaries imitated this practice, using as signature a phrase like "May Salvation be renewed," an allusion to Jeremiah 31:30, or with direct reference to that verse: "A new covenant!"'9 When a large community addressed another, as when that of Palermo, 17.

The senders, one feels, expected him to be just around the corner.20 As we have read in the letter of Solomon b. Elijah written in the 1220s, private persons expressed the desire not to part this life before the exile was terminated.21 Two hundred years earlier, in May 1028, a parnas from a distinguished family, while sign- ing a court record, adds in minuscules written crosswise above and beneath his name: "May God keep him [meaning: me] alive until the Redeemer comes."22 The first of three signatories on an old fragment, probably from the tenth century, writes crosswise above and beneath his name: "Salvation during his [meaning: my] lifetime."23 An inscription containing the ancient prayer "Remember me, O Lord, when You show favor to Your people and take note of me, when You bring Salvation" (Psalms 106:4) shows that the writer was anxious not to be left out of an event which could occur any moment.24 Finally, attention must be paid to the numerous messianic names popu- lating the Geniza scene.

Thus it is natural that their example was followed by the common people.26 There were other messianic names such as Meshullam (Isaiah 42:19, meaning doubtful), which is common, or simply Mashiah (Messiah), which is rare.27 There might have been family traditions in this matter, as when a man is called Mashiah b. Semab,28 or Meshullam b. Mevasser,29 or Meshullam b. Furqdn, the latter being the Arabic equivalent of Hebrew yeshu'ah, Salvation.30 Yesha'dh, which, we remember, is the technical term for the coming of the Messiah, is one of the names most frequently occurring in the Geniza. Although feminine in form, it was given exclusively to boys. M. Stein- schneider, in his trailblazing study on Jewish onomastics in Arab countries thought that abstract nouns used as male names such as yeshu'ah, were found among Karaites and Samaritans, but were not at all, or very rarely, met with among Rabbanites. Geniza research has changed this. Without making any special investigation, I have noted about ninety persons bearing that name, and, as far as I was able to ascertain, all were Rabbanites. One awaited salvation and wished the son to witness it, or perhaps even take an active role in it.3' 25. Unlike our own times, where the meaning of a name is mostly unknown to the parents. Cf.

Shortly before the Muslim year 500 (1111 C.E., the beginning of the Crusader period), a merchant, making dispositions in contemplation of death, appoints his only daughter as his sole heir and his wife as her guardian and executrix. He draws up a long list of his possessions, assets, and liabilities, but at the very beginning of the document he states: "The girl shall not marry before the year 500 of the Arabs is out, which is the End of the Period." From the writings of the Muslim theologian al-Ghazali it is known that the turn of the century was expected to bring about "a renova- tion of the religion" (to which the theologian himself, who died in 1111, hoped to have contributed). From the very succint way in which the mer- chant referred to the End of the Period it is evident that everyone under- stood what that year meant, as far as Jewish expectations were concerned.32 The preceding survey has demonstrated that the belief in the sudden and miraculous appearance of the Messiah was a fact of life. The great event had to be miraculous, not natural, because thus it was foretold by the prophets and expounded in great detail by the theologians, especially Saadya Gaon, whose writings dominated most of the Geniza period.33 There was, however, one great difference: popular messianism was optimistic; it looked forward to an aeon when Israel would be united, safe and happy, being dedicated to the service of God, as laid down in the holy scriptures; the "Pangs of the Messiah," the catastrophes foreboding his appearance, as described in the traditional theory, are not echoed in the day-to-day Geniza correspon- dence. The period did not lack Armageddon-like events, such as the des- truction of Qayrawin in 1057, mentioned above, or the conquest of Jeru- salem by the Crusaders in 1099, terrible famines, plagues, and complete breakdowns of authority; synagogues were destroyed and Torah scrolls desecrated, but I have nowhere read that such occurrences were regarded as Because of its frequency, the name was abbreviated to Sha'a from which a form of endearment: Shuway' was derived. 32.

One mourned the dead, organized help for the refugees and the hungry, and redeemed the books which had fallen into the hands of bedouins or Crusaders. But the mood was not apocalyptic. The pressure of the Galut was always present. But on holidays, or, as one says in Hebrew, "good days," one yearned for the day which would be "completely good." In cataclysmic times one was not eager to be reminded that even more terrible experiences might be ahead. This attitude explains perhaps the strange response found in the Geniza to a most intense crisis of Islamic messianism, which affected also the Jews of Egypt and Palestine in a most tangible way: the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim (996-1021). Al-Hakim regarded himself, and was re- garded by Isma'ilite (Shi'ite) theologians, as the Mahdi, the Savior, "who would fill the earth with justice as it is now full of corruption." Some theolo- gians even declared him to be the Presence of God on earth, and he, at least for some time, did not object. A recent study by J. van Ess has clarified many aspects of this dark period.34 The caliph was inspired by high ideals, but his mind, as is proved by his bizarre edicts, was utterly unbalanced. Acts of messianic self-humiliation (riding on a donkey clad in wool, Zechariah 9:9), and attempts of enforcing stern justice and chastity alternated with vexatious prohibitions imposed on his subjects35 and endless executions (the messiah "who smites the land with the breath of his mouth," Isaiah 9:4, as one Isma'ili theologian put it). All this was done in expectation of the critical Muslim year 400 (lunar years reckoned either from the beginning of the era in 622, or from Muhammad's death in 632). As to Christians and Jews, the Prophet had promised them protection. However, now that 400 years had passed with neither Christ having reappeared nor the Jewish messiah having come, their time was up. They had the choice between conversion to Islam, expulsion, or death. Al-Hakim, the son of a Christian woman, directed his persecutions especially against Christians. In September 1009 (the beginning of the Muslim year 400) the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and many other Christian buildings were destroyed. However, as late as January 1013 the caliph intervened personally and saved the lives of twenty-three Jewish 34.

One of the less obnoxious, but still troublesome, edicts was the prohibition of eating mulfkhiya, a mallow plant made into a dish which was as popular in Geniza times as it is in modern Egypt, or that of eating eels and other fish without scales (which is, of course, biblical; see Deuteronomy 14:10).

This did not hinder him from ordering soon afterward the destruction of the synagogues and applying to the Jews the pernicious edicts inflicted on the Christians. Not long after, however, the fickle caliph permitted the new converts to return to their original religion and to rebuild their houses of worship. What echo did these tremendous events find in the Geniza? We read much about the endeavors of the Jewish authorities to replace the destroyed synagogues, but practically nothing is said about the persecutions. Instead, the Geniza has preserved several copies (or fragments of them) of an "Egyp- tian Megillah," or festive scroll, in which the deliverance of the twenty-three notables is celebrated as a miracle, and the caliph al-IHIkim, "who loves jus- tice and hates iniquity" is extolled as a messiah-like ruler (see Psalms 45:8). A yearly fast and feast were instituted, on which that Megillah was read. The persecutions were forgotten; the miracle was remembered. The wishful optimism of the messianic mood, as described above, prevailed.36 The unforgettable Paul Kraus has shown that the Isma'ili theologian Kirmani not only quoted the messianic passages from Isaiah and Zechariah mentioned above (and others) in Arabic, but reproduced them in the Heb- rew original, both in Hebrew script and Arabic transliteration.37 J. van Ess wonders whether this was done to convince the Jews."3 I should not be sur- prised at all if it were discovered some day that Kirmini, who hailed from northeastern Iran, was himself a Jewish convert to Islam, or a son of one. His excessive use of gematria,39 although not unknown in Islam before him, makes him suspect. In any event, the Geniza indicates that Jews in Egypt did read Shi'ite books. I found an extensive piece of admonitions of a father to his son, in Hebrew characters, which is an abridged version of the caliph 'Ali's ethical will to his son IHusayn, taken from a Shi'ite treatise of the fourth Muslim century. The piece consists of gnomes of pietist ethics, and 36. Mann, Jews 2: 432-36, formerly in Hebrew Union College Annual 3 (1926): 258-62.

When al-IHlkim was murdered, Christians and Jews could realize that Muslim messianic expectations did not fare better than their own. But this did not discourage anyone who was inclined to believe from clinging to the certitude of an impending advent. This is beautifully exemplified by the story of messianic stirrings in Baghdad in the years 1120-21, alluded to earlier in this paper. The historical circumstances of that event, especially in comparison with nearly contem- porary messianic movements, have been discussed by me extensively in con- nection with the edition of the text. Here attention is drawn to the way in which the debacle of failure is overcome by the deft expressions of faith in the basic validity of messianic expectations.41 In a nutshell, the story, told in Arabic,42 was this: a woman from a physi- cian's family, renowned for her piety both before and after her marriage, had an apparition five days before Rosh Hashana 1120: the prophet Elijah ordered her to appear in public43 and to announce in his name that yeshu'ah, Salvation, was near. In response the Jews assembled (what they did is lost; see below), and the Seljuk Sultan, the actual ruler of Baghdad, became paralyzed with fright: "The Jews say 'our kingdom has come; we shall not leave any other kingdom in existence"' (an allusion, of course, to Daniel 2:44). The caliph who was in charge of the affairs of the non- Muslims was not less consternated and ordered "the Jews" (meaning, their notables) imprisoned in the Mint (where in any event many of them were active). Then he sent a letter to the chief qadi as follows: "The time of the Jews is up.44 Either a new prophet (=their messiah) appears among them or they accept Islam. Otherwise they are doomed. Do not stay in my way and in the way of all the Muslims." But the chief qadi, the keeper of the law, remained adamant: "No one doing harm to that people has ever remained 40.

It is steady with God" (Isaiah 66:22). The caliph called Abfi Sahl Ibn Kammina (a man from a Jewish family whose members were in government service for a period of 200 years and asked him to tell the story of the apparition and who saw it.45 After having learned that a woman had originated the commotion, the caliph laughed and made fun of the Jews. "They must be fools to rely on the intelligence of a woman. Tomorrow I shall burn the woman and declare the Jews' lives forfeited." This happened late in the evening, just before the viziers took their leave. Hardly an hour had passed when the caliph himself was honored with an apparition of the prophet Elijah holding a pillar of fire in his hand. The caliph became frightened. As a result, Ibn Kammina and later also the other Jews were freed. What actually happened, we learn from a Muslim historian. The Jews, in their messianic excitement, tore off the badges (yellow ones, as before im- posed on non-Muslims in Baghdad), which they were obliged to wear on their clothing, and, as is evident from the Jewish version of the story, apparently also stopped to deliver certain contributions, and even the poll tax. The end was that they had to pay a very heavy fine, 4,000 gold pieces to the caliph and 20,000 to the Sultan. The "Jilflt," that is, the Rosh Galut, or Exilarch, collected the money.46 The story makes no mention of these impositions. There is a faint allu- sion to the poll tax, optimistically described as a means of protection (as which it is indeed defined in Muslim law). Otherwise, the report is essentially a tale of a miraculous redemption, accompanied by appearances of the pro- phet Elijah and replete with hidden workings of the living word of God. The Seljuk Sultan is disquieted by Daniel 2:44, the chief qadi takes Isaiah 66:22 literally, and the caliph reckons with the possibility of an impending advent of a new Jewish prophet. The popular messianism of the Geniza writings was neither apocalyptic, nor universalistic, and certainly not antinomian. It was a burning desire for redemption from a state of humiliation and a yearning for being with God where He was nearest, in His sanctuary in Jeru- salem. (One lived in a Muslim environment, where the thirst for seeing God was quenched by the pilgrimage to the holy sites of Mecca.) There was a third motive involved: because of the immense mobility of the Geniza society, members of an extended family, who ideally should live in one 45. Ibid.
