In Kabbalah in Liturgy, Halakhah, and Custom, Moshe Hallamish asks the seminal question: From where does the kabbalist, whose sources are heavenly, or at best heard from a teacher, gain the ability to speak into the halakhic tradition (p. 118)? Presumably, the principle of "lo ba-shamayim hi" should prevail, exclud- ing any kind of kabbalistic privilege. He asks further, Is there a historical point where there is a sudden penetration or was it through progressive process? Does the Kabbalah create new forms to exert its influence or does it use the halakhic forms in existence? This collection of thirty-one articles is the most comprehensive at- tempt to assess the relationship between kabbalah and halakhah, prayer, and cus- tom, and as such marks a significant milestone in this important area of research. The book is divided into three sections: "Foundational Issues," "Personali- ties and Approaches," and "Halakhah and Minhag under the Influence of Kabbal- ah." The first chapter of the book, "Problems in Researching Kabbalah's Influence on Prayer," is a consideration of the parameters of the question, and the methods and methodologies required. Hallamish frames the questions of influence as fol- lows: Given that all religions are conservative by nature, and that prayer is an em- phatic carrier of that value, how can change occur? Are the changes due to inter- nal or external developments? Hallamish shows how the Kabbalah jumps over the traditionalistic hurdles of minhag avot and minhag ha-makom through the proliferation of printed tikku- nim and migrations of populations. Mysticism's appeal to a higher authority led to the famous principle attributed to David ibn Abi Zimra (1479-1573) that one should follow the kabbalistic practice if it is a stringency and does not conflict with the rulings of the Talmud. In this manner, the normal channels of due halakhic process were not contravened. Hallamish suggests that the key to success of the Kabbalah-practice relationship is humrah and hiddur, stringency and beautifica- tion. In other words, by appealing to spiritually-minded people, the Kabbalah could exercise leverage on the tradition without necessarily making demands on the pop- ulace as a whole. The call for proper kavvanah, before and during prayer, and before the per- formance of commandments remains a primary popular legacy of the Kabbalah. We witness the advent of "prayer before prayer," to use Hallamish's phrase, in the form of verbal or mental kavvanot. An interesting ramification of attempts to in- spire spiritual directedness through the utterance of a verbal formula such as the le-shem yihud formula was that they raised further anxieties about the lack of prop- er fulfillment. Objections arose from Yehezkel Landau (1713-1793) and others, who declared it arrogance to imagine that his contemporaries might be in posses- sion of an essential formula that previous generations lacked. The middle section of the volume treats texts and personalities considering, for example, "The Halakhic Authority of the Zohar," "The Status of the Ari as a Jurist," and "North African Songs in Honor of R. Shimon bar Yohai." One of the strengths of this section and, indeed, of the book as a whole, is Hallamish's ex- pertise in the Halakhah and customs of the North African Jewish communities. 136</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Among the valuable contributions that Hallamish makes is to correct the prevail- ing assumption, purveyed by R. J. Zvi Werblowski and Jacob Katz, regarding Yosef Karo's (1488-1575) guarded reliance on kabbalistic teaching and experience. He demonstrates in "The Kabbalah in the Jurisprudence of Rav Yosef Karo" that there are more than a few instances in which Karo's experiences with his maggid also left impressions on Karo's halakhic rulings. The third section contains studies dealing with a variety of focussed topics: times to give charity in the prayer service, the liturgical custom regarding love for one's neighbor, familiar and perennial battles over mundane conversations in the synagogue, and a series of blessings that fell in and out of practice as a result of the influence of kabbalah. In "The Place of Kabbalah in Minhag," Hallamish points out that kabbalistic minhagim have a prestige that rises above time and place inasmuch as they are more portable than other minhagim, appealing as they do to a sense of authority. In reading the entirety of the collection, one gleans an historical narrative of the Halakhah-Kabbalah relationship: the Zohar as early innovator of kabbalistic praxis and mindset, Karo integrating Kabbalah into normative halakhic practice, the turning point coming with the plethora of practices introduced by Isaac Luria and his disciples that soon became widespread. This popularization was facilitat- ed through popular kabbalistic-ethical manuals such as Reishit Hokhmah of Eli- jah de Vidas (d. ca. 1593), the Shnei Luhot ha-Brit of Yeshayah Halevi Horowitz (c. 1570-1630), Seder ha- Yom of Moshe Makhir, the Magen Avraham of Avra- ham Gumbiner (c. 1637-1685) which conferred legitimacy on Lurianic kabbalah, and the influential works of the Hida, Hayyim Yosef David Azulai (1724-1806). Hallamish's collection will be an invaluable resource for all those interested in the nexus of Kabbalah with Jewish practice of the last 500 years. His vast re- search entailed investigation of kabbalistic ta'amei ha-mizvot literature, halakhah, minhag, siddurim, and the tikkunim literature. As a collection of discrete articles the book inevitably lacks some unity, but Hallamish asserts that, in any event, many more detailed studies are first required before a comprehensive history of kabbal- ah's effects in these areas can be written (p. 16). The bibliographical plenitude of a number of the articles makes them a valuable resource for further research; more- over, this voluminous compendium of detailed studies will provide those who study the evolution of liturgy, Kabbalah, or Halakhah much with which to be sated.
