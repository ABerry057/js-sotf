<plain_text><page sequence="1">GHOST-WRITING: PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST by DONALD KARTIGANER In writing a trilogy of novels on the life and times of Nathan Zuckerman, American Jewish Writer, Philip Roth has waded manfully into a tradition even more thickly and brilliantly populated than the one he selected as liter- ary background for The Breast. If the grotesque metamorphosis of David Kepesh into a six-foot, one-hundred-and-fifty-pound female breast com- pels us to compare Roth's novel with some of the great texts of Kafka and Gogol, in Zuckerman Bound Roth invokes the more formidable context of James, Proust, Joyce, Lawrence, Mann, and Gide (to mention only a few), several of whose artist-portraits are identified in the trilogy and all implied. Roth has said in an interview that the novelty of this particular portrait is that it describes "the comedy that an artistic vocation can turn out to be in the U.S.A."' The comedy pertains not only to the career of Zuckerman him- self, a series of zany encounters with writers, readers, and critics, whose responses to one Zuckerman fiction become the action of the next, but also 1.

The crux of Rothian comedy is to expose, embarrass, and ridicule, to break bonds and boundaries, pieties and platitudes. The target of Zuckerman Bound, which consists of The Ghost Writer (1979), Zuckerman Bound (1981), and The Anatomy Lesson (1983), is, among other things, the very tradition that authorizes the trilogy's existence. But the aim is by no means simply to dismantle that tradition-the Rothian attack is never so one-sided as that-but rather to situate it within a larger and more tangled arena. Common to the artist-portraits of the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries is the sense of a circumscribed Art and Artist, of rigid demarcations cutting them off from the world of their origins and their effects. But demarcations are precisely what Roth's comic sense finds intolerable. Thus the revision of the tradition in Zuckerman Bound takes the form of an interaction with it; not a substitution that merely results in a new set of boundaries-a Post-Modern portrait, for example, displac- ing a Modern one-but a genuine expansion of our understanding of that world of diverse contexts and relationships in which we all write and read and are read by our fictions. In this essay I will be concerned almost entirely with The Ghost Writer, which sets up the theme of writing that will be explored throughout the tri- logy. The plot of this opening novel, appropriately, is a pilgrimage to the place where the supreme art of an older time is still being practiced-but it is a pilgrimage that has the effect of both honoring and contaminating the sanctuary. In 1956 Nathan Zuckerman, a young writer with four published stories to his credit, comes to the home of the master, the short-story writer E. I. Lonoff-the "most famous literary ascetic in America"-now living in a remote farmhouse in the hills of Western Massachusetts.2 Zuckerman, who has quarreled with his own father over the contents of an as yet unpub- lished story which the latter deems potentially detrimental to the Jews, is in quest of paternal approval from another source: "I had come, you see, to submit myself for candidacy as nothing less than E. I. Lonoffs spiritual son, to petition for his moral sponsorship and to win, if I could, the magical pro- tection of his advocacy and his love" (p. 9). How much he is and is not the 2.

Looking back on this experience-it is now 1977 or 1978-Zuckerman recalls Lonoff as an artist who on the face of it is utterly different from the one which, as the rest of this novel and the trilogy as a whole make clear, Zuckerman himself has become. Nevertheless, now, as then, Zuckerman idealizes Lonoff into the "Maestro," the measure of whose genius and accomplishment is the immaculateness of a life consumed in forging an immaculate art. Lonoff becomes Zuckerman's High Modernist myth of the isolated, inhumanly disciplined artist: an East European Jewish immigrant (pace the more romantic versions of Mallarm6, James, Yeats, et al.), living with his New England heiress wife in the "goyish wilderness of birds and trees" (p. 4). There, surrounded by Berkshire woods to which he is wholly indifferent, Lonoff spends his days "turning sentences around" until a com- pleted text, itself inhumanly disciplined, finally emerges-like an urn, or perhaps a jar, and, like its maker, like nothing else in Massachusetts. The greatness of Lonoff is that he has divorced himself from the world of turbulence and unruliness and from it fashioned an art of perfection and prohibition. The emptiness of his life is exquisitely refined into emptiness enacted as a fiction. Lonoffs typical fictional character, Zuckerman tells us, is a man "thwarted, secretive, imprisoned . . . a nobody from nowhere," whose surprising willingness to risk some change in his routine only leads to a confirmation of his former caution. He discovers that there is really nothing to be done except to make "everything worse." The climax of Lonoffs work has been a collection of stories in which there is no action at all. Even the most tentative consideration of a move breaks itself against "the ruling triumvirate of Sanity, Responsibility, and Self-Respect, assisted handily by their devoted underlings: the timetable, the rainstorm, the head- ache, the busy signal, the traffic jam, and, most loyal of all, the last-minute doubt" (pp. 12-15). The perfection of the stories is the perfection of a still- ness, an evocation of life so finely wrought it bestows on the absence of action an eloquence, perhaps an agony, that a merely tragic act can never have. Lonoff claims for himself a life as uneventful as the lives of his charac- ters, the difference being that instead of even considering action he painstak- ingly inscribes the sentences that compose their paralysis. "I've written</page><page sequence="4">156 DONALD KARTIGANER fantasy for thirty years. Nothing happens to me. .... I turn sentences around. That's my life. I write a sentence and then I turn it around. Then I look at it and I turn it around again. Then I have lunch ..." (pp. 16-18). In the evening he reads the sentences that others write. The view from his wife, Hope, violently corroborates Lonoffs account. She is the partner of his severe enterprise, but one who cannot help but erupt occasionally at its constraints. Weary of her own absence from his world of fiction-making, Hope regards Lonoffs "religion of art" as primarily "rejecting life": "Not living is what he makes his beautiful fiction out of!" (p. 174-175). The immaculateness of the fiction is for Hope the sterility of the life. There are, in fact, disturbances that assault Lonoffs extreme detach- ment: a family, including three children now grown, a wife capable of outcry, even a young woman, Amy Bellette, who may be his mistress. But none of these can penetrate his fiction, except as the sublimated image of that distance from life which the disturbances are designed to bridge. Zuckerman recalls, "I could not think of a single hero who was not a bache- lor, a widower, an orphan, a foundling, or a reluctant fiance" (p. 71). Not a single hero, in other words, who weds, fathers, fornicates, or flees for life from the all-pervading deadness. Nor, finally, do these disturbances make any lasting difference to Lonoff. He rejects Amy's plea that they run off together to Florence, undoubtedly will bring back Hope-who ends the novel by rushing out of the house in hysteria-to her place by the side of his "noble calling" (and dies, five years later, along with news of the subsequent decline of his reputation, in a long Zuckerman parenthesis). In short, both the fiction and the life are impregnable, a fortress of Art and Artist against all the entanglements of being. Their strength, and for Zuckerman their glory, lie in their oneness: the artist gathered into his arti- fice, "a man, his destiny, and his work-all one" (p. 73). Behind this portrait of Lonoff is clearly the High Modernist conception of art and the artist, one that Zuckerman claims to admire, even revere. Derived from German and English romanticism and the French symbol- ists-and for Zuckerman most memorably articulated in the fiction of James and Joyce-the conception holds that the artist is one who necessarily separates himself from normal human activity, sacrificing what Lonoff dismisses as "Ordinary human pleasures" (p. 40). The fruit of that sacrifice is the privilege of producing a comparably isolated art: autonomous, rid of what we normally mean by reference and relevance, uttering through its</page><page sequence="5">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 157 intricate arrangements what Frank Kermode calls "a radiant truth out of space and time."3 This is an art immaculate in its complete melding of Meaning into Being, and in the absence of any of the signs of its makings or its maker. In the classic passage from Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen Dedalus describes the personality of the artist at the furthest stage of his development: it "finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises itself, so to speak.... The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails."4 Although he speaks warmly of Lonoff and his fiction, the bulk of The Ghost Writer consists of Zuckerman's challenge to Lonoffs standards of art, even as he has had to challenge his father's. Unlike the theory of art as a "radiant truth," remote from the ordinary world, Zuckerman's art is appar- ently all too full of reference. "Well, Nathan," his father has told him, regarding his unpublished short story based on the disputed inheritance of a great-aunt, Meema Chaya, "you certainly didn't leave anything out, did you? ... I mean ... you didn't leave anything disgusting out" (p. 85-86). The roots of Zuckerman's stories-the story of Meema Chaya, the story of Amy Bellette that he will imagine in this novel, the novel Carnovsky that will become the occasion of Zuckerman Unbound-these roots are destined always to display themselves, however complicated may be their relation- ship to the fiction itself. The actual details of Zuckerman's life, certainly up to 1956, come to little more than the unexceptional experience of his family and upbringing in Newark, New Jersey, but this is the life he depends on for his art and it is never very far from its surface. Moreover, his shaping of that life into fiction is a process that becomes the virtual center of fiction; the origins and their transformation into new yet vaguely familiar guises become both the essential action and its thematic core. To use a term of Zuckerman's from Zuckerman Unbound (and of Roth's from Reading Myself and Others), we can say that in place of Stephen Deda- lus's idea of impersonalization Zuckerman substitutes the idea of impersona- tion. The writer does not refine himself out of existence or absorb himself totally into his characters; he impersonates his characters, masks himself 3.

Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (New York: Viking Press, 1964), p. 215.</page><page sequence="6">158 DONALD KARTIGANER with their identities even as he exposes his own. The key to the deception is both its extravagance, the sheer distance between origin and disguise, and the disclosure of the fraud while it is going on. Roth comments in an interview: Think of the ventriloquist. He speaks so that his voice appears to proceed from someone at a distance from himself. But if he weren't in your line of vision you'd get no pleasure from his art at all. His art consists of being present and absent; he's most himself by simultaneously being someone else, neither of whom he "is" once the curtain is down. You don't necessarily, as a writer, have to abandon your biography completely to engage in an act of impersonation. It may be more intriguing when you don't. You distort it, caricature it, parody it, you torture and subvert it, you exploit it-all to give the biography that dimension that will excite your verbal life. (RM, p. 144) Impersonation is the heart of Zuckerman's artistic practice; it is also the fundamental theme not only of the trilogy but of all Roth's fiction. In every text we see acts of character transformation, metamorphoses in which old and new selves collide in a tortuous, often grotesque relationship that is incapable of resolving itself or displacing one self with the other. The greater the gap between selves, and the more insistent a character's refusal either to abandon his disguise or completely assume it, the more compelling and cen- tral the character becomes. Commenting on The Anatomy Lesson, for exam- ple, Roth has noted: The thing about Zuckerman that interests me is that everybody's split, but few so openly as this. Everybody is full of cracks and fissures, but usually we see people trying very hard to hide the places where they're split. Most people desperately want to heal their lesions, and keep trying to. Hiding them is sometimes taken for healing them (or for not having them). But Zuckerman can't successfully do either, and by the end of the trilogy has proved it even to himself. (RM, p. 143) The divisions of Zuckerman are the divisions of Roth's major characters, from the title character of "Eli, the Fanatic" a successful attorney who, torn by fear and guilt, eventually dresses himself in the clothes of an emasculated Hasidic refugee, to the notorious Portnoy, knight of rectitude and lunatic of lust, and David Kepesh, son, lover, and-associate professor of literature, wedded, in fantasy or reality, to a giant female breast. The power of these</page><page sequence="7">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 159 metamorphoses, their madness and the condition of their moral break- through, lies in their incompletion: the seemingly irrevocable conflict of warring selves who are yet sustained, and even enlightened, by each other. Impersonation exposes itself as such-it's all an act, the ventriloquist and dummy are equally visible; and thus there is no single identity, no origin or transcendent image that can escape its partner in performance. A new, more complex identity-or meaning, or referent-suspends itself between, enacts itself in the space between selves, "neither of whom he 'is."'5 What Lonoff burns away in a score of drafts Zuckerman dramatizes; Lonoffs tiny parables of silence, of impulse extinguished, become the loud Zuckerman turmoil of identity struggling frantically between disguises. More than anything else, impersonation is a theme and an aesthetic of change--of changing, since no role or guise is to be given up or repressed. For Zuckerman, the most striking quality of Lonoffs art is also its most serious deficiency. It is an art of and about changelessness: stories of action prohibited, echoed as the frozen perfection of an art that carefully conceals the human struggle of its own making. II The Ghost Writer describes the elaborate process of impersonation that produces chapter 3 of the novel, "Femme Fatale"-a piece of fiction created by Zuckerman, the subject and process of which are also impersonation. The plot of Zuckerman's story, which he imagines during the sleepless night he spends in Lonoffs study, is that Amy Bellette, who he has learned is in love with Lonoff, is in actuality, or at least claims to be, Anne Frank. She has managed to survive the Holocaust but has refused to reveal her identity until very recently, and only to Lonoff. The story of Anne Frank's survival is subsumed in the story of Amy's impersonation of Anne: her transformation of herself into an acclaimed writer. The transformation is as fragile or as firm as Amy's shifting explanations of how and why she has continued to 5.

Watson, eds., Reading Philip Roth (New York: Macmillan, 1987), pp. 82-104.</page><page sequence="8">160 DONALD KARTIGANER conceal her identity--even from her father, who at the time of publication of the diary is still alive. Initially, so Amy claims, even as a young refugee in England, she desired to downplay her Jewish identity so that she might achieve a distinction not based on the fact that she had been in the concentration camps; years later, with the surprising publication of the diary she left behind when she and her family were taken prisoner, she decided that the effect of her book and of the lessons it might teach depended on the grim detail that Anne Frank was murdered by the Nazis-that her story was not merely one of "a young teen- ager's... trying years in hiding during the German occupation of Holland" (p. 145). Soon realizing, however, that the world would learn nothing from her book, she saw its function as only "to restore in print [the dead] . . . for all the good that would do them" (p. 147); and with that realization, she switched to a rationale of vengeance, which she could exact only "fatherless and all on her own" (p. 147). But then-Amy's imagination is swift and remarkably fertile-she recognized she had become an object of universal empathy and pity, a figure from which the world was begging forgiveness: "It was too late to be alive now. I was a saint" (p. 150). These shifts are at once carefully wrought and wildly improbable. They are the strength of the story and the exposure of its metamorphic existence: the slightly vibrating lips of the ventriloquist, the gap of revealed making that does not so much give the game away as it is the game. Despite the emphasis in "Femme Fatale," however, on Amy's various maneuvers in supporting her unlikely claim of identity, we must recognize that there is a Lonoffstory embedded here as well as a Zuckerman story of impersonation. The self-exposed process of making does not simply dis- place the finely honed tale, but incorporates it, interacts with it, imperson- ates it as part of a more inclusive aesthetic and action. "Because," Amy says to Lonoff following her disclosure, "it's like one of your stories . . . you'd know how to tell it in three pages. A homeless girl comes from Europe, sits in the professor's class being clever . . ." (p. 124); and then, with an incredi- ble daring, she reaches out for the impossible, pronounces to her mentor that "of all the Jewish writers, from Franz Kafka to E. I. Lonoff, she was the most famous" (p. 152). The professor, who has now moved from writer of his own tales to actor in Amy's, will not budge from the role of Sanity and Responsibility he has always upheld. He suffers mightily for Amy's his- tory-Westerbork, Auschwitz, Belsen-marvels at, even envies, a story that</page><page sequence="9">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 161 has "left my poor art far behind," (p. 125), and does not believe that a word of it is true. Confined by Lonoff's severe economy, the story would project a charac- teristic stasis and silence-Amy pretending to a book without having writ- ten a word, revealing herself plainly as a Lonovian "nobody from nowhere" whose grasp at glory only makes "everything worse." But told by Zucker- man, who is more concerned with the process of daring-the metamorphic action of Amy-aspiring-to-Anne-than he is with the inevitable defeat of daring, the story puts on a different guise. The Zuckerman story releases Amy from mere silence into an incredibly inventive and expressive silence: the "explanations" piling up like patches of plaster on a dissolving mask; the assertion that Anne Frank is impersonating Amy Bellette!-"So I took the sweet name-to impersonate everything that I wasn't" (p. 153); the com- bination of madness and cunning as the naively adoring college girl fanta- sizes herself into an image of terrible suffering transcended by genius. Most Zuckermanian of all-and most challenging to the Lonovian tale, to fiction- al decorum, and, no small matter as we shall see, the sensibility of Jewish readers-there is the ultimate purpose of Amy's stunning performance and her final explanation of why Anne Frank will remain dead. She wants to seduce her professor. Oh, Manny, I want to live with you! That's what I need!... I want to go home to Europe with you. Listen to me, don't say no, not yet. This summer I saw a small house for rent, a stone villa up on a hillside. It was outside Florence ... Oh, Manny, their Anne Frank is theirs; I want to be your Anne Frank. I'd like at last to be my own. .... And as for who I am-well . .. you've got to be somebody, don't you? (pp. 153-54) Implicit to Amy's resourceful revisions of why it is necessary to keep Anne Frank as a victim of the Holocaust is the revision of the Lonovian story into the Zuckerman story-or, more accurately, into a Zuckerman- Lonoff story. "Femme Fatale" foregrounds its making, opens to public view the bravura performance of itself; yet it also sustains the jewel-like tale of boldness denied. The fully metamorphic text involves both a deconstruc- tion, an "un-grounding" of the Lonovian tale, and a "regrounding" of it, revising it into part of the dynamic that constitutes such a text. The quality of firm structure and self-sufficiency, of process purified into product, has</page><page sequence="10">162 DONALD KARTIGANER been disturbed, yet the tale survives within the dynamic of impersonation, of meeting: Amy Bellette-as-Anne Frank; Zuckerman-as-Amy Bellette- as-Anne Frank; the Lonovian tale-as-Zuckermanian tale. "Femme Fatale" is the scene not only of Amy Bellette's impersonation of Anne Frank, but of Nathan Zuckerman's impersonation of Amy Bellette impersonating Anne Frank. For the story, of course, is really Zuckerman's, and The Ghost Writer is the revelation of how it comes to be written, lifts that act of impersonation to the surface of the text. In the pages preceding "Femme Fatale" we get a full account of the per- sonal experiences, the pressures and desires that Zuckerman will carry into the creation of the story. The metamorphic interaction of Amy and Anne Frank is the refined replica of another metamorphosis, which would be mute in the story were it not for the fact that the condition of Amy-Anne's impersonator has been so graphically divulged beforehand. Virtually every- thing Zuckerman tells us about himself in chapters 1 and 2 of the novel is grist for the mill of "Femme Fatale." The major details are Zuckerman's instant sexual attraction to Amy, itself immediately complicated by his inference that Amy is Lonoffs mistress (never conclusively confirmed); his deep admiration for Lonoff and his desire to win his approval; and the fact that Zuckerman is presently embroiled in a quarrel with his father over the story of Meema Chaya. In chapter 2, "Nathan Dedalus," when Zuckerman has presumably retired for the night in Lonoffs study, we follow Zuckerman through what appears to be a characteristically incongruous series of actions: reverently sliding his fingers across the keys of Lonoffs typewriter, then masturbating on his daybed; reading (twice) the James story "The Middle Years," a quo- tation from which is pinned to the study wall, and then standing on the volume on top of Lonoffs desk in order to eavesdrop on the conversation between Lonoff and Amy taking place overhead ("Ah, the unreckoned consequences, the unaccountable uses of art!" [p. 117]). And while all this is going on, Zuckerman is pondering the larger problem of his father's insis- tence that to the gentiles who read it the story of Meema Chaya "is about one thing and one thing only.... It is about kikes. Kikes and their love of money" (p. 94). Judge Wapter, the family's culture contact, has written Zuckerman, pointing out the pleasure the story will bring the anti-Semites, and has suggested that he see the play The Diary ofAnne Frank as an exam- ple of what a Jewish writer can-and should-do for her people. Out of this unwieldy mix of thoughts and emotions-Zuckerman's high</page><page sequence="11">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 163 esteem for James, Lonoff, and Art, his hope of fulfilling Lonoff's expecta- tions for him as a writer, his lust for the mysterious Amy Bellette, his in- satiable curiosity as to what is going on between the great writer and his former student in the room above, his fury at Judge Wapter, his anguish at his father's withdrawal of approval and his eagerness to regain it, his affec- tion for the old Sunday family rituals and yet his loud insistence, "I am on my own!" (p. 109)--out of these ingredients Zuckerman imagines "Femme Fatale," inscribing every detail within its simple outline. Although Zuckerman is as invisible as Stephen Dedalus's God in the words of the story itself, the novel as a whole allows us to recognize every- where a ghostly Zuckerman enacting each of his discordant desires through an imagined Amy Bellette (who is also a real Amy Bellette) enacting her emotions through an imagined and real Anne Frank, who has already enact- ed hers. The achievement and complexity of the story is that it encompasses this series of transferences even as it maintains their contradictions. Zuckerman makes the central character in his story that Jewish writer whose credentials are indeed impeccable-what could please his father, or Judge Wapter, more?-but he has chosen to impersonate her through the medium of another impersonator who is either crazy or wholly unscrupu- lous (perhaps what the gentiles will call a "kike" after all). Zuckerman's reverence-for Lonoff, for his father-masks itself as rebellion, his desire for approval as a quest for independence. Zuckerman's Anne Frank is at once the author of a diary over which the gentiles weep in horror and shame and the egomaniacal artist who will hide her identity from the father she loves in order to secure the power of a "masterpiece" (p. 146). These contradictions, and the exhaustive account of how Zuckerman's inner turmoil has given voice to them within the actions and motives of the fiction, bring the theory and style of impersonation to the climax of its rich- ness. The contradictions are the metamorphic tensions of the story-and of The Ghost Writer. The meanings of writing and living are embodied in the impersonations we see everywhere in the text: the engagement of each of Zuckerman's desires with its opposite, of Amy Bellette with Anne Frank, of Zuckerman with nearly every character in the novel. The effect of these impersonations is to ironize and illuminate both terms of the engagement. Zuckerman's incredible behavior in Lonoff's study debases and empowers "Femme Fatale," exposes motives that complicate even as they contami- nate. The story seeks to transcend its origins, transmuting indecency into tragedy, only to find itself constantly sliding back into its all-too-mundane</page><page sequence="12">164 DONALD KARTIGANER beginnings. It is merely another story about a writer, Zuckerman-as- Amy-as-Anne Frank, exploiting every available scrap of material in hopes of producing-or at least being given credit for-a supreme fiction.6 III My focus on metamorphosis and impersonation in The Ghost Writer- particularly as a mode of writing that incorporates and subverts a Lonovian or High Modernist art-suggests similarities with two distinct and in certain ways opposing aspects of Post-Modern literary theory, one of which addresses the question of the origins of texts, the other the question of how-and whether-texts can ever arrive at coherent meaning. The first of these insists on the necessary reflection within a text of the socioeconomic- political-cultural moment of its making, and regards the High Modernist description of the immaculate work of art transcending that moment as both illusory and reactionary. The second aspect, while acknowledging the entanglement of the text within the various pressures that have produced it, also rejects the High Modernist claim that the literary work comprises a complex but completely harmonious system of interlocking elements, whose meaning may no longer be reducible to "paraphrase"-that is to say, what passes for meaning in the workaday world--but nevertheless speaks an intelligible, universal truth. Making use of the deconstructionist critical method, this approach exposes all texts as webs of contradiction, the strands of which are ultimately traceable to an impasse of undecidability. Linking both of these approaches is the common enemy of what they regard as High Modernist mystification-whether it be a mystification of making or of meaning. A text is nothing more than the articulated stuff of "space and time"; and its meaning is less a "radiant truth" than, at best, a stay against confusion, and, at worst, a network of irreconcilable attitudes. Clearly The Ghost Writer, with its elaborate disclosure of the disparate and at times vulgar origins of "Femme Fatale," demystifies the High Modernist notion of the immaculate text whose origins have been con- 6. For a somewhat different version of the relationship between Amy's and Zuckerman's use of Anne Frank as a way of gaining acceptance in the Jewish community, see Hana Wirth- Nesher, "The Artist Tales of Philip Roth," Prooftexts 3 (September 1983): 263-272.</page><page sequence="13">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 165 sumed, leaving behind a kind of pure, sourceless utterance. Moreover, the novel challenges the possibility of coherent meaning, primarily through its demonstrations of character as a dynamic of clashing identities. Irresolution of character, not only in The Ghost Writer but in Roth's fiction generally, becomes the measure of one's authenticity and even one's courage, as opposed to those who engage in self-deception or repression. The contra- dictions of The Ghost Writer, as I have tried to demonstrate, are most com- pletely realized in the character of Zuckerman, whose desires constantly turn over into their opposites-his ambition and self-deprecation, reverence and defiance, affection and resentment, modesty and aggressiveness, trans- lating themselves into a fiction as apparently duplicitous as he. But The Ghost Writer, and Roth's fiction generally, goes beyond the Post-Modern inclination to undecidability, to textuality as a perpetual pro- cess of its own unraveling. Crucial to Roth's fiction is a version of center or ground, but one that is complicated by the fact that each text carries out a deconstruction of ground through its action of metamorphosis. The burden of the text becomes its effort to divest itself of a secure center-to challenge the conventions of character consistency, of clear, coherent action (not to mention the conventions of social decorum and good taste)-and yet to re- ground itself, to regain a less substantial center that does not retract the metamorphic disruption. This re-grounding resides in the dramatization of new meaning in the space between conflicting identities-meaning as the very meeting of which impersonations are made. Roth's central characters all experience the recognition of themselves as at once Origin and Other, as ventriloquist and dummy, as given and imagined selves whose "real" iden- tity lies in the experience of that recognition. In The Ghost Writer Zuckerman re-grounds his disparate desires, and all their metamorphic versions, in a complex central image of Zuckerman as the Jewish Writer of Silence-that is, as the Jew whose essential identity is to write in and of his silence. This is a "center" which opens into countless con- tradictions, yet it asserts a genuine control over the entire trilogy, transform- ing it into a vehicle of meaning-however multilayered-rather than a vast exercise in aimless role-playing, or even nihilism.7 This image of the Jew begins, significantly enough, as the center of 7. Jonathan Brent, in "Philip Roth: Imagination and the Self," in Milbauer and Watson, Reading Philip Roth, makes a strong argument for Zuckerman as in fact a nihilistic character: "a character with no centre at all, a vortex of energy producing a vacuum within" (p. 184).</page><page sequence="14">166 DONALD KARTIGANER Lonoffs High Modernist parables, and becomes "impersonated" by Zuck- erman into the center of the entire trilogy. Lonoffs stories, according to Zuckerman, are free of every element of Lonoffs life except one, which exists everywhere in the canon: "I think of you as the Jew who got away," Zuckerman says, "Away from all the Jews, and a story by you without a Jew in it is unthinkable" (p. 51). This is the single ounce of personal self that the immaculate artist Lonoff can allow into his fiction. Each of those "nobod[ies] from nowhere" is a Jew, whose condition epitomizes the para- lysis, the "Not living" of which Lonoff has made his eloquent art. Lonoffs spare parables of frustration are the kernel of the Jewish Writer of Silence from which the trilogy emerges. In his revision of the Lonovian aesthetic, Zuckerman borrows that image of the Jew, revising it to his own need. His fictional act in The Ghost Writer is to impersonate the Jewish writer Anne Frank, the writer whose silencing by the Nazis is a crucial part of the eloquence of her art-as Zuckerman claims through his fictionalized Amy Bellette, herself a Jewish writer trying to write her silence through The Diary ofa Young Girl. The figure of Anne Frank becomes the means by which Zuckerman breaks through the writing block-the threat of silence-which he experiences in the chapter "Nathan Dedalus." He is unable to complete a letter to his father-who has urged him not to publish his latest story-refuses to write a letter to Judge Wapter, and finds himself imaginatively frustrated by the extraordinary scene be- tween Lonoff and Amy Bellette that has just occurred in the room above him: "My astonishment at what I'd overheard, my shame at the unpardona- ble breach of his trust, my relief at having escaped undiscovered-all that turned out to be nothing, really, beside the frustration I soon began to feel over the thinness of my imagination and what that promised for the future" (p. 121). Having just been toasted at dinner by E. I. Lonoff-"To a wonder- ful new writer" (p. 29)-Zuckerman suddenly finds himself overwhelmed by life itself into an awareness of the poverty of his talent-and turns imme- diately, in a burst of bizarre impersonation, to Anne Frank, the murdered writer who made a book about incarceration, who became the most famous Jewish ghost writer of them all. The Jew silenced is what writers make words of in The Ghost Writer, whether the writer be Lonoff, Zuckerman, Amy Bellette, or Anne Frank. And this situation of the writing of silence-this metamorphic tension-is the center of each of the fictions that make up the trilogy and its epilogue.</page><page sequence="15">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 167 The second novel, Zuckerman Unbound, is the silencing of Zuckerman through his very eloquence: his inability to get beyond the consequences of his own stunning success, the novel Carnovsky. No longer writing, he spends all his time running from, sleeping with, or being verbally assaulted by his readers, who range from Alvin Pepler to members of Zuckerman's own family. Pepler is himself a silenced Jew. Champion for three weeks on a rigged quiz show, he was compelled to lose to another contestant, Hewlett Lincoln, because "they couldn't afford to let a Jew be a big winner too long. ... To break the bank you had to be a goy like Hewlett. The bigger the goy, the bigger the haul" (p. 214-215). Now he showers on Zuckerman the words of his victimization by the media and, as it turns out, by Zuckerman himself. In The Anatomy Lesson Zuckerman is silenced by a mysterious pain in his shoulders and back that prevents him from writing, as well as by a liter- ary critic, Milton Appel, who has not only condemned Carnovsky but has rescinded his praise for Zuckerman's earlier work. Following his decision to remain silent by halting his writing career for good and going to medical school, Zuckerman begins to create again, at least vocally, this time by impersonating his critical silencer, Milton Appel-but not before altering Appel's identity from literary critic to editor of a pornographic magazine, Lickety-Split. At the end, however, having shattered his jaw falling on a gravestone, Zuckerman is in a hospital, his "mouth clamped shut" (p. 683). "The Prague Orgy" expands Jewish silence into the national experience of Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia, yet for Zuckerman the condition of the Czechs solidifies around another image of Jews silenced. The Prague he visits reminds him of what as a boy he imagined as a Jewish homeland, a city like this, dark, deteriorating, filled with stories, "the national industry of the Jewish homeland .... What you smell are centuries and what you hear are voices and what you see are Jews, wild with lament and rippling with amuse- ment, their voices tremulous with rancor and vibrating with pain.... That such things can happen-there's the moral of the stories-that such things happen to me, to him, to her, to you, to us. That is the national anthem of the Jewish homeland" (pp. 761-762). Zuckerman's quest in Prague, which is to retrieve a collection of unpub- lished Yiddish stories by a dead Czech Jew, culminates in failure. The police confiscate the manuscripts, which Zuckerman, lacking Yiddish, has been unable to read. The outcome of his quest is nothing more than that</page><page sequence="16">168 DONALD KARTIGANER "Another Jewish writer who might have been is not going to be" (p. 782). The writer with whom the ghost writer disguises himself is himself another ghost. This image of the Jewish writer silenced operates in the trilogy as a re- grounding of the deconstruction of a more stable Modernist ground. And yet the image is replete with ironies which threaten to dissipate its power as any kind of center. Nathan Zuckerman is the image at its most complex point of contradiction, for he impersonates the Jewish writer silenced into a trilogy of words; ties himself to the victimized, the frustrated, the muted, the dead as the vehicle for his voice; writes on and on, of and as the nightmare of his own potential silence. The ultimate re-grounding here, however indirect or oblique the refer- ence, is the Jewish writer imagining the Holocaust-the ultimate Silence. This is the fragile center of the trilogy, always imperiled by its position in the context of destabilized utterance that the very fact of the Holocaust has created. The event is not only the silencing of the Jews; it is the event that silences itself, that does not speak, that throws into doubt the validity of all effort at articulation. Imagining-"impersonating"-the Holocaust is Zuckerman's act of re-centering as his only means of understanding that event which is itself the de-centering moment of our time. "The difficulties of telling a Jewish story," Roth has commented, "was finally to become The Ghost Writer's theme" (RM, p. 166). The Jewish story here is the Holocaust, the "difficulties" are the processes of Zuckerman, who projects himself into the Holocaust through the image of the writer of silence. As remote as anyone can be from the event itself, Zuckerman nevertheless knows first-hand the writing and silence that are the twin terms, the metamorphic dynamic, of his profession. He writes a trilogy of novels about that tension, establishing it as the condition of every writer, of all writing, seizing it as his only possible entrance into what he cannot and must understand. The Jewish writer born and raised in New Jersey imper- sonates the Jewish writer born in Frankfurt, raised in Amsterdam, and dead at sixteen in Belsen-herself metamorphosed into the voice of six million. That the various silences of Zuckerman should become a metaphor for the Holocaust, or even for the silence of Anne Frank, whose voice survived her death, must appear as unseemly a fictional tactic as anything else in this writer who has never hesitated to shock his readers, particularly the Jews. And yet this is the underlying thrust of Zuckerman Bound, a fact suggested by Roth in an interview shortly before the publication of the trilogy as a</page><page sequence="17">PHILIP ROTH'S PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST 169 single volume. Commenting on the incident in The Anatomy Lesson in which Zuckerman's mother, just before her death, writes on a piece of paper the word "Holocaust" instead of her name, Roth identifies the Holocaust as an unstated yet indispensable theme of the trilogy. "Without this word there would be no Nathan Zuckerman, not in Zuckerman's fix" (RM, p. 136). Roth quickly qualifies the statement, as if reinstating a decorum that even he will not violate: "No, no, of course not"-the subject of Zuckerman Bound is not the Holocaust. And yet, in much the same way that Rothian characters are themselves and others, live their lives on the dual planes of surface and shadow, the subject is the Holocaust. This is the powerful yet ghostly force that darkens and deepens this trilogy of novels about writing: "it is simply there, hidden, submerged, emerging, disappearing, unforgot- ten."
