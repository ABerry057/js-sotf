Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2005. xiii, 650 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001165 At the beginning of his book, which won the Koret Foundation's Jewish Studies Publication Program prize, Marcus Moseley points to "a contemporary ten dency for the critics of autobiography themselves to yield to the autobiographical impulse in their discussions of the texts at hand" (2). As a scholar of Yiddish auto biography, let me briefly indulge in such a recollection. In the fall of 1991, I was fortunate enough to take a course on "Jewish Autobiography" at the Jewish Theological Seminary, cotaught by Moseley and David Roskies. The course was modeled on Moseley's recently completed doctoral thesis, Jewish Autobiography in Eastern Europe: The Prehistory of a Literary Genre, published by Oxford University in 1990. Moseley's dissertation and the class helped me develop the concept for my doctoral thesis on Yiddish autobiographical writing. Main points and sections of his dissertation reappear in Moseley's book, which has been considerably expanded and reads fluently as an extended magisterial essay. 206</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Moseley focuses on Jewish autobiography in Hebrew and Yiddish, thereby excluding works in other languages that, according to Moseley, "would require a very different methodological model from the one here adopted" (2). In the intro ductory chapter, Moseley points out "that the Yiddish autobiographical voice ... differed markedly from that of Hebrew. It became clear to me that treatment of the topic thus necessitated a conceptual and literary historical framework other than that here employed in tracing the origins of Hebrew autobiographical writing and thinking?a much less Rousseau-centric framework" (15). He prom ises a sequel about Yiddish autobiographical writing that will examine that body of work (479). As has been well documented, Rousseau's Confessions (1781) is a major influence on modern Hebrew autobiography. Rousseau's work was particu larly important, as Moseley repeatedly stresses, for creating the autobiographical discourse that would enable the publication and reception of premodern Hebrew and Yiddish autobiographical writing in the late nineteenth century. However, as Moseley acknowledges, the Rousseau-centric model is far less relevant for the formation of Yiddish autobiographical writing. Except for interest ing general observations and close readings of Glikl of Hameln's and Meir Viner's memoirs, Moseley does not systematically examine this body of Jewish autobio graphy in eastern Europe. A good starting point for such an analysis is Dan Miron's seminal study A Traveler Disguised (1973),1 which traces the origins of Yiddish fiction "according to which this language was construed as the archetypi cal language of the other, the non-self, or even anti-self (16). Like Yiddish fiction (the novel and the short story), Yiddish autobiography originated in a different cul tural context and with a different readership (more working-class, female, and socialist) than Hebrew literature. Although classical Yiddish writers such as Sh. Y Abramovitsh and Y L. Peretz also became classical Hebrew writers and worked within a bilingual Jewish discourse, a distinctive Yiddish literary system started to crystallize in the 1890s. Yiddish autobiographical writing in the twentieth century (its most prolific period) can therefore be discussed separ ately from that of Hebrew. Nonetheless, the similarities and mutual influences between autobiographi cal writing in Yiddish and Hebrew are evident even after 1945, as Moseley points out in his comparison of autobiographical works by Agnon and I. B. Singer. The various cultural and ideological contexts in the United States, Soviet Union, Poland, and minor Yiddish centers (Buenos Aires, Paris, Melbourne, Montreal, and Johannesburg) created a variety of local contexts for the development of Yiddish autobiography. As a rule, the Yiddish autobiographical genre is more con cerned with depicting the collective and the Other than delving into self-revelation and self-reflection. As a major offshoot of the genre in eastern Europe, Hebrew autobiographical writing in Israel has mostly been framed by Zionist ideology, in some cases in critical and subversive ways, as, for example, in Amos Oz's 1. Dan Miron, A Traveler Disguised: The Rise of Modern Yiddish Fiction in the Nineteenth Century (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996). 207</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews much-acclaimed A Tale of Love and Darkness (2001), translated by Nicholas de Lange into English in 2005. Moseley's selection of autobiographical texts highlights their transgressive potential, hybridity, and fusion of multiple genres. A prime example is Moseley's analysis of Ya'aqov Halevi Lipschitz's Zikhron ya'aqov (1924-30), the autobio graphy of an Orthodox rabbi, which he reads as a clash between the religious char acter of the sefer (the holy book) in contrast to the bukh (the secular book) concerned with the more mundane life experiences. This work's fragmented and, in some cases, subversive character underscores the tension between autobio graphical expression and collective religious ethos that is also a key to Moseley's reading of Glikl of Hameln's Zikhroynes (written in the late seventeenth century and first published in 1896). Moseley develops his model for the study of Jewish autobiography in contrast to what he brands the "tradition" model represented by Yankev Shatski and David Roskies. The "tradition" model views Jewish autobiography as a response to collec tive catastrophe in Jewish history that, beginning with autobiographical fragments from the Bible, produced a Jewish genre of autobiographical writing that developed autonomously and independent of the genre in the main languages (67-68). In con trast to this model, Moseley rightly points out the centrality of Rousseau for the origins of Jewish autobiography in German (Solomon Maimon's Lebensgeschichte, 1792-93) and Hebrew (Mordecai Aaron Guenzburg's Aviezer, 1864, and Moses Leib Lilienblum's Hattot ne'urim, 1876). Moseley elaborates on how the develop ment in imaginative prose (particularly the novel and the mayse?the story) shaped the themes, form, and narrative style of Jewish autobiography, for instance in Berdichevsky's work, pointing to the centrality of delineating the blurry territory between fiction and "the autobiographical." Moseley's study, Michael Stanislavsky's Autobiographical Jews: Essays in Jewish Self-Fashioning (University of Washington Press, 2004), and my own Ima gining Lives: Autobiographical Fiction of Yiddish Writers (University of Wiscon sin Press, 2005) introduce various models and methodologies in the study of Jewish autobiography. Deriving much of their theoretical and methodological apparatus from the field of autobiographical studies that began in the 1970s with Philippe Lejeune (a main influence on Moseley), James Olney, and Paul J. Eakin, these three new works chart the field of Jewish autobiography from very different vantage points. Jewish autobiographies, particularly the ones written in the premodern period are frequently labeled sui generis in Moseley's book. Similarly, the three new scholarly works provide the first systematic attempt (in English) to establish coherent theoretical and historical frameworks for the study of Jewish autobiography. Moseley's application of the Rousseau paradigm grounds the field in a historical context of publication data, critical reception, and textual influence. His flexible approach to the definition of Jewish autobiography allows for the inclusion of fictional genres, testimonies, letters, encyclopedia entries, and other texts. As Moseley notes, the decline of Hebrew-Yiddish bilingualism and the increased fragmentation of Jewish culture after World War I make his conceptual model less appropriate for examining the increasingly multilingual and multicultural qualities of Jewish autobiography in 208</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the second part of the twentieth century. The scholarly attempt to provide theoreti cal models for studying Hebrew and Yiddish autobiography is, as Moseley stres ses, inherently problematic because of the genre's amorphousness and variety, which tend to undermine any attempt at categorization and demarcation. Neverthe less, Jewish autobiographies written in many languages proliferate as never before in the early twenty-first century, continuing to raise questions about self-revelation and self-concealment and what it means to write about "life" in a Jewish context.
