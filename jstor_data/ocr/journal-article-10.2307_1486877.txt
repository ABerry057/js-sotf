<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Y. B. Hood. Aquinas and the Jews. Philadelphia: University of Pennsyl- vania Press, 1995. xiv, 145 pp. This book tries to rescue St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) somewhat from the deplorable tradition of Christian hostility toward Jews which the medieval Church encouraged off and on in word and deed, most egregiously during and after the Crusades. Hood's rescue is only half-hearted, it seems, partly because of his evident moral revulsion at the long shadow of Church-related Jew-hatred (whose origins he traces briefly to the Gospels and Paul's Letters), and partly also because of his evident intellectual impatience with medieval theology in general (and so with Aquinas in particular). The result is an uneven account, whose many fine and sensible insights are all too frequently mixed with careless errors of fact and dubious ideologizing interpretations. The chief documentary sources for Aquinas' view of Jews are his remarks on the Old Law (Summa theologiae I-II.98-105), his consideration of the general question of religious unbelief (II-II.10), and his responsum to the duchess of Brabant concerning Jews and usurers (the so-called De Regimine Judaeorum), as well as his passing treatments of the crucifixion in his various biblical commentaries and in Summa theologiae III. As for this last, Hood</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 123 rightly shows how Aquinas moderates or softens the harsh view handed down from patristic and other authorities, that all Jews (not just Jesus' contemporaries) were guilty of Jesus' death; Aquinas on the contrary restricts Jewish guilt to the leaders of Jesus' generation, and then too only on the grounds that they were familiar with the signs of Jesus' divinity and acted against him out of envy. Here as elsewhere, Aquinas "typically opted for compromise" (p. 73). Unfortunately, Hood does not always notice the textual subtleties which are indicative of just how far-reaching that compromise may have been. For example, in the passage just referred to (111.47.5), Hood paraphrases Aquinas unsubtly concerning the Jewish leaders' purportedly sufficient "evidence to know" the signs of Jesus' divinity (p. 74), whereas Aquinas (following his sources carefully) uses a Latin verb more suggestive of "recognition" or "acquaintance" (cognoscere), though in any case Aquinas maintains (in agreement with 1 Cor. 2:8) that all of them "ignored," or perhaps "remained ignorant of' (ignorebant), the mystery of his divinity. As for Aquinas' remarks on the Old Law, Hood is instructive in pointing to Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed as the source for his understanding of the literal details of the biblical legislation; here Aquinas "consciously chose to follow Maimonides rather than the patristic tradition" (p. 52). But Hood fails to consider the full implications of Aquinas' Maimonideanism--say, by exploring the pertinent analogy between Maimonides' contention that biblical law, unlike the nomoi of other nations, aims at the well-being of the soul over and above that of the body, and Aquinas' defense of the Church's view that over and above the literal (i.e., strictly historical) meaning of each of the various laws are symbolic meanings whereby the laws prefigure Christian events and teachings. Generally speaking, Hood does not give Aquinas credit for discerning in Maimonides et al. a philosophical prudence which underlies his softening of the excesses of the patristic tradition. Instead Hood commits such howlers as to claim that Maimonides, lacking Aquinas' literary access to Aristotle's Politics, was "unable or unwilling" to understand the Bible's judicial precepts in their political context as part of "a civil and criminal code" (p. 57)-as if Maimonides had not read Plato or Farabi and had never written Mishneh Torah or indeed Guide 111.26 ff.! Similarly, in a different but related context, Hood states peremptorily that for Aquinas the Jews' continuing practice of the ceremonies of the Old Law, being tantamount to a denial that their symbolism has been fulfilled in Christ and that the ceremonies are therefore superseded, is a mortal sin-without noticing, however, that Aquinas later in the passage in question indicates in his statesmanlike way</page><page sequence="3">124 BOOK REVIEWS that the sin applies only to Christians, not to Jews, with the implication that Jewish worship ought to be tolerated (Summa theologiae 1-11.103.4 ad 2, with II-II. 10.11). Hood's underappreciation for Aquinas' quasi-Maimonidean statesman- ship in reformulating Church doctrine is likewise evident in his confusions about the Summa's treatment of Jews under the general heading of unbelievers. Hood admires Aquinas' arguments against forced conversions, etc., but sees them as rather eclectic and idiosyncratic, without any solid basis in the theological tradition (as if this were not the very problem Aquinas was trying to correct!), and therefore in the long run politically ineffective. Indeed this last is Hood's most frequently leveled criticism: in looking at Aquinas as a kind of retail distributor of the wholesale goods of Church doctrine such as he takes them to be, and so judging him, as it were, by the standards of an efficiency expert, Hood underestimates the importance of Aquinas' having inherited as well the deep resources of the tradition of pre-Christian political philosophy. He does take note of Aquinas' elaborate "nontheological" appeal to "natural justice" (pp. 89-90), though without reflecting further on how that appeal might be integral to theological considerations which are guided, as Aquinas' are, by the principle that grace does not destroy nature but perfects it (cf. I.1.8 ad 2, 60.1 ad 3). Only in passing does he touch on the crucial point that the distinctive difficulties Aquinas faces or is forced to face concerning Jews come up under political circumstances which no longer obtain today, namely, "in a Christian society" (p. 93), that is, where Church doctrine quand meme is held to be the social bond. Hood crudely mistakes Aquinas' abiding caution and conservatism in these matters as a naive and narrowly aristocratic class-interest (cf. p. 66). He might have been better led by his own bons mots to the effect that Aquinas' overall position in favor of tolerating Jews "is more like a determinatio, the act of making the best possible prudential judgment given the circumstances, than a straightforward deduction from first principles" (p. 92), and that "As usual, if [Aquinas] had doubts about the Church policy, he kept them to himself' (p. 88). Finally, a gem of Aquinas' statesmanlike rhetoric is his responsum to Marguerite, daughter of King Louis IX of France and duchess of Brabant. Hood describes Marguerite simply as a powerful patroness of the Dominicans, but she also seems to have been a lady of remarkable prescience for directing her practical questions about Jews and related matters to Aquinas in the first place. From his responsum, we gather that she has asked eight questions, five of which concern the Jews in her duchy, but that the general worry</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 125 prompting her inquiry is financial--more specifically, the financial abuses of her own tax officials and the widespread financial corruption, of which tolerance of usury is a symptom-for her three other questions concern the sale of public offices, the taxing of Christian subjects, and the extortionate practices of her tax-collectors. Aquinas answers her first four questions (which concern receiving monies from usurious Jews, whether as taxes, fines, gifts, or restitutions to victims of usury) by indicating a need for close financial supervision of those whom she delegates to administer the recovery of usurers' illegitimately acquired profits. Among other things, he repeatedly counsels the duchess to seek legal guidance from long-standing precedents, i.e., from the time before her duchy fell into its present moral abuses; he seems ever alert to the danger that Jews will be used as scapegoats to excuse those abuses, and his advice if followed would in every case circumvent that danger. Aquinas thus practices theological conservatism for the sake of political moderation. Throughout he applies two implicit maxims. First, wanton expropriation is never justified. (Thus, usurious profits may be expropriated from Jewish usurers only if they are restored to the original victims.) Second, sudden despoliations are improper. (For example, usurers must not lose all means of livelihood but should be directed to other occupations, etc.) Pace Hood, Aquinas' pellucid casuistry here, as elsewhere, combines impeccable logic with a gentle rhetoric designed to allay potential predators among his coreligionists.
