<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Gutwein. The Divided Elite: Economics, Politics and Anglo-Jewry,</page><page sequence="2">276 BOOK REVIEWS 1882-1917. Brill's Series in Jewish Studies, vol. 5. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. 501 pp. In The Divided Elite, a revision of his doctoral dissertation, Daniel Gutwein challenges what he calls the "monolith" conception of the late- Victorian communal elite, the so-called Cousinhood. In his view, historians mistakenly treat the London Jewish haute bourgeoisie as a homogeneous social unit, sharing a common outlook and values, and even when they acknowledge internal rivalries and divisions, ascribe little significance to them. It is Gutwein's contention that there was an important rift within the elite, that this division manifested itself in opposing policy positions in communal and national politics alike, and that these were conditioned by the nature of the economic activities in which the rival parties were engaged. Because communal leaders were integrated into the British financial elite, enjoying "unconditional membership," their politics, including their positions on intracommunal issues, were formed by the mechanisms that shaped the outlook of other City men rather than by uniquely Jewish concerns or sentiments. Gutwein's account is a valuable corrective to the tendency to treat the late-Victorian elite as homogeneous and dismiss the rivalry between its two most powerful figures, the first Lord Rothschild and Samuel Montagu, as basically a personal clash of two financial titans determined to have their way. In what is the most innovative section of the book, Gutwein demonstrates how their differences in the communal arena mirrored their differences in national politics and the banking community. Montagu was a radical liberal and supporter of Gladstone, one of the few City men to remain loyal to the Liberal Party after 1886; Rothschild was a classical liberal, a Unionist after 1886, and an opponent of state social welfare schemes. Montagu, whose firm was not part of the inner circle of merchant banking houses that controlled the Bank of England, wanted Parliament to curb the Bank's power and redirect monetary policy to serve commerce and industry better; the Rothschilds, on the other hand, were associated with the merchant banks that derived their profits from foreign loans. In Jewish life, Montagu opposed "the very plutocratic principle upon which the Cousinhood's rule in the community was based"; he worked to decentralize community power and democratize community politics, in part by generating "new practices of independent public action among the lower classes" (p. 157). Lord Rothschild and his</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 277 family headed the communal establishment whose exercise of power Montagu assailed. Gutwein states his case without subtlety or nuance, but it is sound, nonetheless. Had he been content to leave matters here, showing the interrela- tionship between communal politics, on the one hand, and economic interests and national politics, on the other, his contribution would be uncontested", I believe. However, he takes his argument a step further, claiming that Montagu's and Rothschild's views in communal affairs were epiphenomenal, that is, derivative of their positions in a much larger arena, and were formulated without reference to matters that affected Jews in particular, such as antisemitism and the aliens question. This kind of historiographical reductionism, while novel, illuminates little. Its view of the determinants of human behavior is simplistic. It overstates the social integration of Jewish bankers and brokers and the extent to which they were subject to the same influences as their Christian counterparts. And it is at odds with recent efforts to understand the formulation of communal policy in the context of British hostility to Jewish particularism. Can Gutwein expect us to believe that gentile perceptions of Jews and Judaism exerted no influence on the ways in which communal leaders responded to East European immigration or Zionism? Are we to believe, as he suggests, that Edwin Montagu's raging self-hatred and neurotic eagerness to distance himself from his Jewish background exerted no influence on his hostility to Zionism? Significantly, Gutwein seems unaware of the relationship of his thesis to the current debate about the character of antisemitism in Victorian Britain and its precise impact on Jewish identity and politics. Were his thesis correct, rather than idiosyncratic, it would be a powerful refutation of the view that the conditional nature of Jewish emancipation in Britain crippled Jewish assertiveness and creativity. But as it is, his book fails to engage this position, giving the appearance of having been written in intellectual, if not geographical, isolation from current scholarship on the history of English Jews. There are, in addition, errors of fact and judgment that suggest that the author's grasp of English Jewish history is not as sure as it might be. He situates the Hambro Synagogue and the Great Synagogue in the East End of London, for example, rather than in the city. He writes as if the members of the Montagu-sponsored Working Men's Club were immigrant workers, rather than better-off, native-born East End residents. He describes the English Hibbat Zion movement as a rising power in communal politics,</page><page sequence="4">278 BOOK REVIEWS wielding considerable influence in the East End (which he believes explains Montagu's enlistment in it), when, in fact, it was quite marginal. Although the book's title suggests that it is a study of the communal elite, its focus is, in fact, more narrow, being essentially a study of two prominent families. This in itself is not troublesome, given the current penchant in academic publishing for inflated book titles. What is problematic is the author's use of "family" as an organizing concept. Gutwein considers the Rothschilds a single family unit and the Montagus and their kinfolk, the Franklins and the Samuels, another, and writes as if the two groups operated as cohesive factions or blocs in both communal and national politics. It is this assumption that is questionable. While it is true, for example, that Samuel Montagu used his wealth and influence to advance the political careers of his son Edwin and his nephews Stuart and Herbert Samuel, and that they, as well as the Franklins, were Liberals, it would be wrong to infer from this that they held similar positions in regard to Jewish issues. As is well known, Herbert Samuel and Edwin Montagu clashed head-on over the question of Jewish nationalism. Other cousins of the same generation-Lily Montagu, Marion Montagu, Hugh Franklin Bentwich-held equally diverse views in regard to Jewish issues. Despite my reservations about the larger claims of Gutwein's book, I believe there is much to be learned from his account of the links between policy issues in communal governance and national politics. This being so, it is unfortunate that the book has a list price of $125. It will be acquired by few libraries and even fewer, if any, historians. Even latter-day Rothschilds and Montagus may find it beyond their means. Todd M. Endelman University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Mich.</page></plain_text>
