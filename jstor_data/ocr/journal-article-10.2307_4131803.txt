<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Berkowitz. The Jewish Self-Image in the West. New York: NYU Press, 2000. 176 pp. Images are popular these days, and even scholars of the Jewish experience are turning to them seeking to find another avenue to gain further insight into the historical past. A spate of recent studies has given more credence to this direction. One hopes that soon, authors will not have to begin their work, as has traditional- ly been the case, by rejecting the perceived implications of the adherence to the Second Commandment for Jewish creativity. Michael Berkowitz has contributed to this development in his various studies on Zionism, in which he has argued for the centrality of iconography to the movement, in particular the images of Theodor Herzl, for the emerging sense of a national consciousness. In the present study, Berkowitz places visual material of sixty years (from 1880) at center stage and widens his scope and trajectory to show how Jews "perceived representations of themselves" and "appropriated modern media to exert a greater control over their lives as well as to realize their humanity more fully" (p. 11). This is certainly a tall order to achieve in an introduction and two additional chapters ("The Gallery of Zionists" and "Greater Deviations"). This, then, is not an easy book to review. I admit from the outset that the book 177</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews suffers from the author's inflated promises of its contribution to our understand- ing of the modern Jewish experience. Much more is expected than is offered. Its contours are revealing: There are 105 illustrations, 16 pages of references, and 19 pages of bibliography, leaving very little room for interpretive text. Even if pic- tures are worth a thousand words, the minimal text can hardly attempt to answer seriously the wealth of questions posed in the introduction (pp. 11-52). Though we are told that the book is also meant to be "an interpretation of applications of art, graphics and photography, over time, which accompanied and fostered the eth- nic mobilization of Western Jews in the realm of popular culture" (p. 11), Berko- witz leaves much to be desired in creating the links between the visual material and the social and political framework. How does Berkowitz show the contribution of the visual sphere to the po- litical and "ethnic mobilization" and what form does the "interpretation" of the vi- sual imagery take? I will begin with the latter question, as it relates to many of the author's methodological comments in the introduction and elsewhere on the sig- nificance of visual material and its use for historical research. Berkowitz has brought together a wide array of photographs, paintings, drawings and other me- dia from archives, journals, postcards and other ephemera. They focus on Zionist personalities, Jewish athletes, and political figures of an anarchist and Yiddishist bent, and on various paintings and drawings. His purpose was not, I presume, to reveal unfamiliar images, as most have been published, and many are well known to scholars of Zionist history and iconography and to students of American Jew- ish history. Berkowitz could have easily expanded the corpus by consulting a fine catalogue dealing with Zionism, where he would have found some less common images that provide unique insights into Zionist iconography, the place of Herzl in the imagination of Jews from different countries, and the role of symbols in modern Jewish discourse.' Berkowitz rejects a "formalist analysis of Jewish iconography," preferring "to illuminate the historical processes that are accessible through Jews' public self- representation" (p. 19). What this means is not perfectly clear and one is hard- pressed to find a definite method to his use of the visual imagery. The images, though central to the raison d 'tre of book, are treated in an unsystematic and care- less manner. Many are brought without reference to their date or context, others are left without any comment or discussion, and hardly ever are we offered an in- sight into the resonance (or reception) of the work mentioned. The failure to deal with reception is all the more surprising when one of the goals of the book is to give substance to the claim that "the visualization of Jewish politics" (p. 51) made ethnic politics possible. Berkowitz may prefer a non-formalist analysis but one still expects some basic information on the sources that constitute the heart of the book. Thus, for example, we are shown an interesting portrayal of Herzl by Max Kurtz- weil (p. 59), but told nothing about the artist, or whether it was done before the Zionist leader's death, or what the work was meant to convey. In other cases, we are left wanting either because we are provided with erroneous information, as in 1. Rachel Arbel, ed., Blue and White in Color: Visual Images of Zionism 1897-1947 (Tel Aviv: Cat. of Beth Hatefutsoth, 1996). 178</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the caption to illustration 42 where both the year and Hebrew translation rendered are incorrect, or because his remarks on the illustrations (as in the case of nos. 52- 54 and in many others as well) provide only minimal or partial information. More- over, except in the cases of Herzl (where Berkowitz is at his best) and Albert Ein- stein, the author rarely provides us with a sustained interpretation of a visual im- age while taking into consideration imagery that challenges that interpretation. Just as it requires a detailed argument to prove that Herzl's visibility and repre- sentation enabled Jews to feel a sense of belonging to an emerging nation, so it seems important to address the way images of socialist figures facilitated ethnic politics. I am thus regrettably unclear why certain visuals were chosen, how they communicate the social and political messages attached to them, and what under- lies the method of interpretation. Has the author succeeded in showing the contribution of the visual sphere to the political and "ethnic mobilization"? In "Greater Deviations," he treats a wide spectrum of Jewish political movements in the United States, Britain and Western Europe (pp. 94-129)-anarchism, Jewish communism and radicalism, trade unionism and workers' associations-and a wide gallery of individuals, some of whom are visually represented in the book. Berkowitz finds that these movements and individuals showed a clear desire to integrate into the surrounding society while asserting a uniquely Jewish sense of pride that manifested itself in the im- ages appended to the chapter, but how these connections are made escaped me, like the caption to the image of Meyer London of New York, stating: "Unques- tionably a favourite son of New York's Lower East Side, he did not need a beard to be identified as Jewish" (p. 116). The other figures and movements brought to- gether here, almost at random, help Berkowitz make the claim that they were all engaged in a new form of ethnic politics. Hardly, I daresay, a radical thesis for any- one who has read the work of Chimen Abramsky, Jonathan Frankel and Ezra Mendelsohn, to name but a few scholars of the Jews and of the political left. Visual imagery has much to offer historians of the Jewish past, however, its usefulness depends upon the way it is processed and interpreted. In this work we are treated to many images but left wondering what guided the author in this book-the illustrations or the themes he wished to explore. Incorporating images in historical writing is not an end in itself but a means to widen our historical un- derstanding and through historical interpretation to further the meaning of the vi- sual material.
