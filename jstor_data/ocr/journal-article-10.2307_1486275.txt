<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan F. Segal. Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Chris- tianity and Gnosticism. Studies in Judaism in Late Antiquity 25. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1977. xxiv, 313 pp. This book, a revision of a dissertation directed by Professors Judah Goldin and Nils Dahl at Yale University, consists of two distinct halves.' The first (pp. 33-155) is a discussion of the rabbinic texts which oppose, or seem to oppose, a belief in "two divine authorities" (or "powers," shetai reshuyot). The second (pp. 159-258) is a survey of the likely targets of the rabbinic polemic (Philo, Jewish "sectarianism" [including New Testament Christianity], Christianity of the second and third centuries, Marcion, and Gnosticism). The whole is preceded by a long introduction and followed by a brief conclusion, extensive bibliography, and detailed indices. What is the heresy of "two powers in heaven"? The best brief discussion remains that of George Foot Moore, Judaism in the First Centuries, 1:364. If the leaders of Palestinian Jewry had little fear of actual lapse into polytheism and idolatry, they had greater concern about a defection from the strict monotheistic principle of a different kind, the currency of the belief that there are "two authorities." The references to this error do not define it. A theory of "two authorities" might be entertained by thinkers who held that God is the author of good only, and that for the evil in the world another cause must be assumed; or by such as in their thinking so exalted God above the finite as to find it necessary to interpose between God and the world an inferior inter- mediate power as demiurge; or ... both these motives might occur. Moore proceeded to note that a belief in two antagonistic deities is implicitly 1.

Two Powers in Heaven is an elaboration of Moore's insight. Segal argues that the rabbinic polemic against complementary dualism ("binitarian- ism") is older than the polemic against antagonistic dualism (henceforth simply "dualism"). The binitarian heresy which disturbed the Yavnean sages, notably R. Akiva and R. Ishmael, was based (1) on Daniel 7:9 ff. (Daniel sees two figures in heaven, the "Ancient of Days" and the "Son of Man"), (2) on various other verses which seemed to suggest the existence of an angelic mediator between man and God, or (3) on the idea that the divine attributes of justice and mercy were independent beings. Another form of the heresy was that Adam or one of the angels assisted God in the creation of the world. R. Nathan, who lived a generation after R. Akiva and R. Ishmael, is the earliest attested combatant of a dualistic heresy, the idea that the God who created the world and gave the Torah is not identical with the highest God, because the former is wicked and the latter is good. In the second part of the book Segal develops the conclusion that many varieties of first-century Judaism (including nascent Christianity) were binitarian, but that dualism, the hallmark of Gnosticism, is a product of the second cen- tury. Segal suggests that the rabbis rejected Christianity precisely because it was a "two-power" heresy, and that this rejection caused within certain segments of Christianity (characterized by the church fathers as "Gnostics") the shift from binitarianism to dualism. The power responsible for evil was identified with the God of the Jews. The book has numerous strengths, mostly in the second half. Segal has demonstrated that (some of) the rabbis would have regarded not only Gnosticism but also Philonic Judaism and early Christianity as "two- power" heresies. He has also demonstrated that the arguments of the here- tics were based on scriptural exegesis no less than those of the rabbis. Many rabbinic stories have a "philosopher" or a gentile pose a difficulty drawn from Scripture, and Segal's work shows the reality which might be lurking behind this literary convention. The book has numerous fine observations about the connections between rabbinic and Christian exegesis (see esp. pp. 119 and 220 ff.) and about the nature of Gnostic dualism (Segal shows that rabbinic-style polemic would not have impressed Marcion much, but I wonder whether the rabbis would have known that). Segal's suggestion about the origins of Gnostic dualism has provoked much discussion (see now van den Broek in Vigiliae Christianae 37 [1983]: 41-71).2 2.

In the transition from dissertation to book the text should have undergone further revision. It is overly long, repetitious, diffuse, difficult to follow (in places), and marred by numerous misspellings and typographical errors-Tertullian would have cringed to find the phrase alterius deus attri- buted to him (pp. 239 and 241). The first part of the book is thorough, almost exhaustive (although the rabbinic accounts of the changes intro- duced in Scripture by the Septuagint deserve more than a footnote [p. 129, n. 13]), but the second part is not, and the criteria by which material was included or excluded are not readily apparent. Segal practically ignores the magical papyri (including Sefer ha-Razim) and the christological contro- versies of the second to the fourth century, and could have extracted much more than he does from the Nag Hammadi texts. Segal also omits the patris- tic testimony that the Jews worship angels. More serious is Segal's abuse of the rabbinic evidence. If pages 33-155 are read before pages 159-258, the sequence suggested by the page numera- tion, Segal's exegesis of the rabbinic texts often seems farfetched. Even when approached after a reading of the analysis of the nonrabbinic material, his exegesis is not always convincing. The oldest texts which explicitly refer to the "two-powers" heresy are (1) Mekhilta Shirata 4 (discussed on pp. 33-57), (2) Mekhilta Ba-.Hodesh 5 (discussed on pp. 57-59), and (3) Sifre Deuteronomy 379 (discussed on pp. 84-89). Texts (1) and (3) are anony- mous, (2) is a statement of R. Nathan. Segal admits that (2) and (3) oppose dualism, not binitarianism, but suggests that (1) opposes a binitarianism based on Daniel 7:9 ff., on the two different names of God (YHWH and Elohim), and on the belief that the divine attributes of justice and mercy were independent beings. This exegesis is unlikely, since the Mekhilta does not know that Daniel 7:9 ff. is a potential source of error (it quotes the passage as part of the rabbinic response to the heretics), does not refer to the variety of God's names and attributes (Segal's long discussion of the doctrine of the attributes of justice and mercy is irrelevant), and contrasts one verse in which God appears as "a warrior doing battle" with another in which God apears as "an old man full of mercy"-a conception which seems more dualistic than binitarian. Mekhilta Shirata 4 is paralleled by Ba-.Hodesh 5, a version which contains R. Nathan's polemic against dualism, not binitarianism. Segal knows from Philo and first-century Christianity that binitarian ideas were shaped by Daniel 7:9 ff. (see now Jane Schaberg, The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit: The Triadic Phrase in Matthew 28:19b [1982]) and the doctrine that God had different names and</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 117 attributes. Segal assumes that the Mekhilta knows this too, but his exegesis is forced. To a reader not yet aware of the Philonic and Christian evidence, it seems farfetched.3 The earliest rabbinic text to refer explicitly to a binitarian belief in an angelic mediator is the famous baraita about Aber (called R. Aher by Segal on p. 72) in B. Hagigah 15a, whose historical reliability is subject to debate. In sum, the rabbinic evidence neither supports nor refutes the view that binitarianism precedes dualism. Segal does not extract this view from the rabbinic texts as much as he imposes it upon them. Segal makes two assumptions which are important for his case but which do not command universal assent: (1) the tannaim were active and informed participants in the dialogue with Christianity, and (2) the "Jewish- Christian" split was provoked by theological, rather than halakhic, division. Tannaitic texts seldom refer to minim and evince little interest in defining either heretical or normative theology. Although the Mishnah never refers to angels, we may assume that the rabbis of the second century, like their later continuators, believed in angels, demons, and spirits of all sorts. What made the belief in two powers heretical was not the belief itself but the consequences of the belief: the worship of a power other than God. Proverbs 8 could inspire some amoraim to imagine that God created the world with the assistance of Wisdom or Torah, but this belief was not heretical because the rabbis did not pray to Wisdom or Torah. Belief in angels and angelic powers was not heretical, worshipping them was. Segal ignores this approach and focuses exclusively on the theological debate. Furthermore, Segal regularly refers to rabbinic "orthodoxy" without defining what this might have meant in the second century of our era and without assessing the theological diversity of rabbinic Judaism. In sum this is a provocative book which deals with some of the non- monotheistic forms of ancient Judaism. It is important for students of Gnosticism and "Hellenistic Judaism," but they should not blindly follow Segal's interpretation of the rabbinic material. And it raises methodological issues which the author does not address. Shaye J. D. Cohen Jewish Theological Seminary of America New York, N.Y. 3.
