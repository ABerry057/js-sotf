<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven Weitzman. Song and Story in Biblical Narrative: The History of a Literary Convention in Ancient Israel. Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1997. xiv, 209 pp. The present volume is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation written under the direction of James Kugel at Harvard University. Steven Weitzman learned well from his mentor. Both scholars have mastery over ancient Near Eastern comparative literary studies and methodology. Furthermore, Weitzman deals with aspects of biblical prose and poetry, as did his teacher. This in no way demeans Weitzman's study; on the contrary, it enhances it. Weitzman builds upon his teacher's work for his own research. In the introductory chapter of the present volume, Weitzman sets the intellectual stage for the impressive show that follows. His investigation here rejects the notion that biblical mixing of story and song is "a mixing of reason and emotion, of objectivity and subjectivity, or of the sublime and the mundane." This interpretation is but an imposition of our own literary culture and sensitivities onto the Bible. Weitzman insists that the sense of poetry and</page><page sequence="2">366 BOOK REVIEWS prose is contingent and culture-bound. Hence, his copious and persuasive comparative analyses. In this learned and extensively researched work, Steven Weitzman tracks the development of the incorporation of songs in biblical narratives from a mere literary feature to a self-conscious, scripturalized convention. Originally, the fusion of song and story reflected Israel's recombination of preexisting materials shared with other ancient Near Eastern cultures into new composi- tions. Weitzman reviews, for example, the likelihood that Exodus 15, Judges 5, and Deuteronomy 32 were composed prior to their present literary setting in the Bible. He demonstrates, however, how the biblical narrators reworked the earlier materials for their new narrative surroundings. The new combinations draw God into the action of a battle and present the final teaching of a dying sage. Weitzman also cites the biblical fear that the introduction of foreign cultural elements constituted a threat to Israel's belief in God. Israel, therefore, often disguised its indebtedness to other Near Eastern literatures. The clear literary influence of the surrounding cultures on Israel is seen, nevertheless, in the stories and songs of Exodus 14-15, Judges 4-5, and Deuteronomy 31-32, which raises the interesting issue of Israel's tension between two opposing forces: borrowing from other Near Eastern cultures and striving to establish independence from them. Weitzman draws freely upon all the necessary comparative evidence. He argues that in the course of time, as the narrative and song compositions developed into the early stages of precanonized literature, early Jews came to look upon the literature as norms for religious action and literary composition. It was this perception that led the canon-conscious Jews to incorporate songs into other biblical-narratives-in-the-making. The merging of story and song was not merely stylistic. Weitzman makes a compelling case that "the early Jews expected their biblical heroes to break out into song whenever they were delivered by miracles. When biblical figures failed to do so ... early Jewish readers ... responded by re-imagining and even rewriting biblical history so as to provide the missing song" (p. 127). This subsequent development was a "theologizing" and not solely a literary adaptation of the material. Later, Tobit, Judith, Joseph and Asenath, the Apocalypse of Abraham, the Testament of Job, and the Gospel of Luke also have their heroes utter songs of praise upon their miraculous rescues. The rabbis, too, creatively invented songs for their biblical heroes. Weitzman looks upon this development as momentous in the literary history of ancient Israel. For it is here, he notes, that a special sanctity and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 367 authority was ascribed to inherited texts. This stage, he contends, completely reshaped the act of reading and writing in ancient Judaism. The extension of this idea, the idea of the Bible as literary and liturgical paradigm, eventually resulted in nothing less than the full canonization of the Bible as holy scripture. It is not a new idea in biblical scholarship that several of the songs embedded in biblical stories were secondary interpolations. Commentators, however, have not satisfactorily explained the reasons for the introduction of these songs. Weitzman's work fills this void. It shows that many of the songs were the products of correctives inserted by canon-conscious Jews who sought to harmonize biblical narrative with its elevated literary and paradigmatic status. Although many of the paraphrases and interpretations of the Jewish readers were preserved in postbiblical literature, in some instances--and this is the bulk of the study--"early scribes evidently rewrote the biblical text itself-'postscripted' it--to overcome the difference between biblical narrative as it was and as it was expected to be in the wake of its scripturalization" (p. 129).
