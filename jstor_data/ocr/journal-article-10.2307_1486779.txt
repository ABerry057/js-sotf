<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeffrey Herf. Divided Memory: The Nazi Past in the Two Germanys. Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997. 527 pp. In the last decade, the scholarly literature on the topic of memory and the Holocaust has grown exponentially, with the result that an entire cottage industry has grown up around vague theorizing about social and collective memory. Jeffrey Herf's new book is a superb antidote to this trend because he offers a balanced, lucid, and archival-based portrait of exactly how the personal experiences of postwar leaders in the two Germanys contributed to the very different paths taken to reconstitute German identity and politics after the Second World War. After what Herf calls the Nuremberg Interregnum, which was so crucial because Germans could henceforth disagree about the causes of Nazism, but not about its fundamentally evil nature, the political culture of the two German states evolved by appropriating various and sometimes conflicting historical narratives about Nazism, and equally diverse interpretations of its causes. Herf argues that the main historical narrative in what became West Germany centered on the destruction of democracy in the Weimar period as the crucial mistake to be avoided in any future political reconstruction. West Germany's most important early political leaders agreed, across the political spectrum, on the moral and political necessity of public atonement for the crimes of the Nazi regime and on financial restitution to and political relations with the State of Israel. In the East, on the other hand, after Stalin dropped his initial support for Israel in 1948, an older Communist narrative, in which the issue of antisemitism was marginalized, led to a stress on the sacrifice of Communists in the fight against fascism. Hitler's war against Bolshevism was viewed as the essence of the Nazi regime, while its war against the Jews was deemphasized, with the result that the memory of Jewish victims and the centrality of the Holocaust became obscured and politically dangerous for any Communist leader to advocate. In comparing the two political cultures, Herf applauds, on the whole,</page><page sequence="2">416 BOOK REVIEWS West Germany's confrontation with the fascist past, while the East German Communist government is depicted as morally bankrupt, self-serving at best and criminal at worst. He is careful, though, to point to the checkered path in both cases and how in West Germany the unambiguous recognition of guilt was interspersed with sporadic moods of self-pity and moral equivocation. Konrad Adenauer pursued a two-pronged strategy of rhetorically condemning Nazism, along with Communism, as nihilistic and un-Christian, while he worked hard to put an end to the prosecution of former Nazis and facilitated widespread rehabilitation of compromised civil servants and professionals to their former positions. Conservatives have long argued that these measures were politically astute because the Adenauer regime was thereby able to stave off a right-wing revival and integrate reluctant Germans into new democratic forms of government. To his credit, Herf punches holes in this argument and shows how Adenauer's policies allowed criminals back into the German judicial system and, in the context of the Cold War, allowed average Germans to fall into a collective amnesia about the full extent of German crimes on the eastern front. The chancellorship of Willy Brandt from 1969 to 1974 was a crucial turning point in this regard, because the Social Democrats realized that a more thorough reckoning with the crimes of the Nazi occupation in the East was the only way to assure Eastern Europeans that postwar, democratic Germany had really changed. With the election of Helmut Kohl in 1982, Herf traces the resurgence of a self-exculpatory right-wing discourse on the German past, culminating in the disturbing symbolism of the Bitburg cemetery, where Ronald Reagan and Kohl honored German SS soldiers, thereby eliminating any distinction between victims and perpetrators. Herf's narrative is underpinned by many new and exciting archival sources from the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) and the infamous Stasi files of the paranoid and bizarre East German secret police. One of the heroes for Herf is the Communist leader and secret comintern agent Paul Merker, who returned from Mexican exile after 1945 with the hope of guiding East German policy toward restitution for Israel and placing the Holocaust at the center of Communist antifascism. Merker was pushed out of the Politburo in 1950, and after a series of secret trials was sentenced to eight years in prison in 1955 for being an "agent of Jewish capitalists." Like a detective, Herf brilliantly pulls together the desultory narrative of betrayal and opportunism from an incomplete archival record. Although it is perhaps a touch naive to believe that Merker's program had any chance of success in Moscow-dominated Berlin, Herf does show that the alignment of East Germany with the Arab world,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 417 including training and arming Palestinian terrorists, could have come about only with incredibly independent ideological blindness about the history of antisemitism. This is an important contribution to the history of postwar German political culture and leaves one with the optimistic impression that people can indeed learn from historical mistakes. My only criticism is that Herf tends to project the lessons learned by Germany's postwar leaders, the majority of whom suffered at the hands of the Nazis, onto the general population. It is not clear that ordinary Germans assimilated the lessons of the past as seamlessly as the Sunday speeches of German presidents that he often quotes. But the important questions that Herf asks in this book, and goes a long way to answering, will undoubtedly help other scholars in formulating future research projects in this area.
