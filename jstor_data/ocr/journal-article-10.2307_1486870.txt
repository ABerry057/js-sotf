Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995. xvi, 279 pp. The Indiana University Press is to be commended on another brilliant study in its Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature series. Herbert J. Levine studies Psalms employing methodologies that recognize both the aesthetic and the ritual nature of these prayer-poems. The psalmists essentially speak and sing to an unseen listener. Levine, therefore, brings the study of orality and speech acts to bear on the psalms and uncovers the conventions of human speech and communication that shaped those creations. And, in order to better understand the relationship to the "Unseen Auditor," Levine takes advantage of findings from the study of anthropology, religion, and religious symbolism and conventions of the ancient Near East. Among the discerning discussions in this volume is a section entitled "The World of the Psalms: The Perspective of Ritual." Levine here examines how societies define their purity rules, and how they use rituals and ritual language to effect transitions from states of impurity back to purity. The Psalms, argues Levine, are ritual utterances parallel to the ritual sacrifices offered in the Jerusalem Temple and described in Leviticus and Numbers. Both the words and the rites symbolically concretize for worshipers their status as vulnerable creatures dependent on God's grace. Thus, the Psalms accompanied the Temple offerings and drew out the implications of the sacrifices. Several of the Psalms, for example, feature a "sheep" metaphor for the people of Israel. Levine argues that sacrifice is a dramatization of this metaphor. "Both the nietonym and the metaphor of animal sacrifice converge in the people's experience of itself as innocent lamb, dependent on God's protecting love, or utterly vulnerable to its seeming absence. In the act of sacrifice, the people align themselves with God's power over life and death.</page><page sequence="2">106 BOOK REVIEWS Though mute, the sacrificial act is saying, in effect, 'We can be like you in killing this sheep, which stands in for us; do not be this kind of God to us' " (p. 58). "From Here to Eternity: The Perspectives of Time and Space" is the most enlightening chapter in a fully insightful and informative book. Leaning heavily on Mircea Eliade, Levine distinguishes between human and divine time-frames. Ordinary time, as seen by humans, is continuous, flowing, and irreversible, whereas sacred time recovers, repeats, reverses, and reactualizes. Through ritual, humans can reverse the course of time. The Sabbath, for example, is a weekly reactualization of the primordial rest of God following the Creation. Through participation in religious ritual, humans connect them- selves to the divine perspective on time. Time flowing ever onward can also be defeated, as many religious cultures tried to do, by invoking an afterlife for the individual or for all human history. The afterlife is an end-time parallel to the primordial beginning time. In a conception of human history as linear but stretching between two atemporal states, "the most distant past in effect becomes the future. At the moment of transition, the present era ends with a great destruction, presaging the beginning of a new era" (p. 133). The poetic language in Psalms vividly depicts God's eternal, cosmic time-space. Levine recognizes the human need of the psalmists to bridge the gap between the human and the divine realms through discourse about God. The psalmists praise and interpret the world they experience, thus establishing a relationship to that which is beyond their limits. The awesome heavens depicted in Psalm 8, for example, testify to God's being, but they also point to the insignificance of humankind. "What is man that You have been mindful of him, mortal man that You have taken note of him?" (8:4-5). "The human task, accordingly," writes Levine, "is to acknowledge the true relation between the incommensurable partners in dialogue: 'YHWH, our Lord, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth!' (8:2, 10)" (p. 139). The readings of the Psalms through the various lenses of contemporary rhetorical, linguistic, religious, historical, and anthropological scholarship are sensitive and convincing. Levine's book is a valuable addition to the literature on the Psalms. Daniel Grossberg State University of New York at Albany Albany, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
