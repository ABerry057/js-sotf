<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bruce Zuckerman. Job the Silent: A Study in Historical Counterpoint. New York: Oxford University Press, 1991. viii, 294 pp. Bruce Zuckerman's new book is both a highly unusual and a very engaging study of one of the most enigmatic documents in the Hebrew</page><page sequence="2">294 BOOK REVIEWS Bible. The book is unusual in that Zuckerman analyzes Job and its literary growth by comparing it to a famous Yiddish folktale called "Bontsye Shvayg," or "Bontsye the Silent," written in the late nineteenth century by Y. L. Perets. Zuckerman begins his study by noting that it is rather strange that Job is remembered by tradition as the pious patient believer even though almost the entire book reveals a Job who is anything but patient. In order to better understand how the traditional reading came to overshadow the more obvious but less pious reading, Zuckerman finds a modern example of the same phenomenon. He demonstrates, rather convincingly, that Perets's story is actually an indictment of the traditional view that one must remain silent in the face of suffering. The specific motivation behind this story was "the palpable anti-semitism of Perets' time and the violent pogroms that were its clearest manifestation" (p. 45). Perets was criticizing those traditionalists who maintained that one must silently accept disaster as God's will. Yet, the vast majority of later translators and interpreters of the story miss the parody and read it as a simple reaffirmation of traditional piety. Zuckerman argues that this process of misinterpretation is due primarily to the fact that the experience of the Holocaust has changed the figure of Bontsye from a figure who was a parody of piety into "what he must become in a post-Holocaust world: no longer the ultimate fool, the ultimate schlemiel, but, rather, the ultimate victim" (p. 68). Zuckerman makes the hermeneutical wager that similar historical factors may be at work in the way that the Book of Job reached its current canonical shape. In a subtle and articulate manner, Zuckerman speculates that the largest body of material in the Book of Job, including most of the poetic material found in chapters 3-31, was a scorching parody of an earlier, more traditional folktale about a pious man named Job who suffered in silence and was rewarded in the end. Zuckerman provides strong support for his reading of this material as a parody by adducing a small arsenal of traditional motifs that are turned upside down and inside out. Next Zuckerman turns his critical eye to the question of how the story of Job was transformed into the text that we find in the Bible today. His answer is that the tradition really could not afford to ignore or discard the poetic material because it would have remained a greater threat outside of the tradition than within the tradition. To neutralize this threat, the tradition absorbed the material and, furthermore, began to temper the critique by appending material such as the Hymn to Wisdom in chapter 28. Zuckerman</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 295 speculates that just as the Holocaust transformed the character of Bontsye, so too the author of the Hymn to Wisdom may have "felt, as he stood in the shadow of the tragedies of his time, that the 'joke' of the Joban parody wasn't funny anymore-that the time for satire had passed" (p. 145). Zuckerman also analyzes the motivations behind other additions to the book, such as the Elihu speeches, and the prose framework at the beginning and end of the book, in an attempt to demonstrate that different redactors read the text in different ways. In turn, each redactor responded by making additions to the text in order to bring it into line with his specific theological hermeneutic. Zuckerman's brilliant analysis has its weak links as well. He posits that the poetic section of Job is earlier than the prose framework, which he argues was created in order to bring the anti-traditionalist stance of the earlier poetic chapters into line with the more traditional viewpoint held by the later redactors. But in order for this hypothesis to be true, one must assume the following dubious facts: (1) the existence of an earlier and widely known tradition of Job the patient that the author of the poetic section was reacting against; and (2) that the poetic material originally stood by itself without a narrative framework, or alternatively, that it had a different framework that is now lost. While Zuckerman's ideas cannot be completely refuted, it seems more natural and more plausible to argue that the author of the poetic materials broke open the earlier story now found in the prose framework and in certain other sections of the poetic material (e.g., chaps. 27-28), and inserted his poetic dialogues into this earlier story, thus changing the original story of Job the patient into the more ambiguous story we find in our Bible today. This is to say, in agreement with Zuckerman, that the effect of the combination is one that indeed mutes the message of the poetic section, but in disagreement with him, that this effect may have been created by the author of the poetic section rather than by a later, more traditional, redactor. The author of the poetic section could have intentionally edited his scathing critique of piety into the traditional story of Job both to heighten the sense of parody and to make it more palatable to the general reading audience, who could accept the critique more easily because it was cloaked in the earlier tradition out of which it had grown. To Zuckerman's credit he fully acknowledges that his reconstruction of the canonical growth of the Book of Job, like any other, is very speculative. What makes Zuckerman's book so compelling is that even if one disagrees</page><page sequence="4">296 BOOK REVIEWS with aspects of his highly conjectural thesis, he unfolds his carefully crafted argument with such finesse that he manages continually to bring new and interesting insights into focus.
