<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY THE SHEFFIELD DICTIONARY OF CLASSICAL HEBREW by GARY A. RENDSBURG David J. A. Clines, ed. The Dictionary of Classical Hebrew. Vol. 1: Aleph. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1993. 475 pp. It is not difficult to see the massive amount of excellent work that went into the production of this new dictionary of ancient Hebrew. Unfortunately, it is equally easy to see its faults and failings. First let us set the book under review in the context of other dictionaries of ancient Hebrew. The two standard works of Biblical Hebrew currently in use are BDB (Brown-Driver-Briggs, Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, 1907) and HALAT (Koehler-Baumgartner, Hebrdiisches und Aramiiisches Lexikon zum Alten Testament, 1967-90, this work has now begun to appear in English translation). Both of these are based on older works, the former going ultimately back to Gesenius (1815) and the latter based on an earlier work by the same authors (1953). Most importantly, both works rely heavily on etymologies, and both are limited solely to Biblical Hebrew (with additional sections on Biblical Aramaic). By contrast, the present project, headed by D. J. A. Clines, calls itself The Dictionary of Classical Hebrew (hereafter DCH), by which is meant all sources of the Hebrew language up to 200 C.E. Accordingly, this work lists all words occurring in the Bible, inscriptions, Ben Sira, Qumran, Nahal Hever, Wadi Murabba'at, etc. The nonbiblical materials comprise about 15 percent of the corpus. Because of the expanded corpus and because of the larger amount of information it includes, this new dictionary will, upon completion, AJS Review 21/1 (1996): 111-118 111</page><page sequence="2">112 GARY A. RENDSBURG be more than double the size of HALAT and nearly four times the size of BDB. The project plan calls for eight volumes with an estimated 3,835 total pages. DCH departs from its predecessors in listing no etymologies. The editors (I use the plural form to refer to Clines and his staff of researchers) believe that the presence of cognate material in other dictionaries "is highly problematic, and it is difficult to see what purpose it serves," and that "data about the meaning of cognate words in Akkadian and Arabic, for example, are strictly irrelevant to the Hebrew language" (p. 17). Thus, instead of emphasizing the meanings of words with attention to etymology, DCH emphasizes the uses of words. Or in the editors' words: "we subscribe to the dictum that the meaning of a word is its use in the language. The focus here, then, is not so much on the meanings, or the translation equivalents, of individual words as on the patterns and combinations in which words are used; and attention is paid primarily not to the unusual and difficult words but to the common words" (pp. 14-15). With this in mind, DCH displays "in exhaustive detail, all the subjects and objects that are attested for every verb, and for nouns, all the verbs and all the other nouns with which they are connected" (p. 15). (As we. shall see with our example below, the information presented is in fact even more complete.) This feature is undoubtedly the most important contribution of this dictionary.' To take an example, let us look at the common noun 'xT. The entry is divided into four sections, based on the different uses of the word: "humanity, people," "individual," "the man" (with article), and "son of a person, individual" (in the specific expression tr7? 1:). Under the first of these definitions the entry presents the following information: the approximately forty verbs predicated of nxN as subject (r'n,, T'51, a~n, mD, pTyp , p Kt, n?v, ?mt, n', ?ttn, wS,, ~t, ino, and so on); nominal clauses such as "m DT (Ps 144:3); the approximately thirty verbs of which vix serves as object (nri, wi, 5, at, nsr, ;'a, nn, ~ , etc.); dozens of construct phrases with 0tt serving as both nomen regens and nomen rectum (e.g., nai v uN [1QS 11:9], 'N :a [Gen 8:21], etc.); appositional usages (in this case there is but one: 'tV T'r t [Isa 22:6]); adjectives attached to nu8 (e.g., Yi in Ps 140:2); prepositions used with the word (most of the standard ones [-:, -5, -=, p7, etc.]); and finally various collocations (with anumn, V), etc.). Also, 1. The fourth and final volume of HALAT moved in this direction, though not with the completeness of DCH; see my review in AJS Review 18 (1993): 95-102.</page><page sequence="3">THE SHEFFIELD DICTIONARY OF CLASSICAL HEBREW 113 scattered throughout the entry are indications of various words found in parallelism with otM (e.g., u', ynx, etc.). And all of this appears only in the first section of the entry, under "humanity, people." For the following three sections corresponding to the other uses of t1u, the same wealth of detailed information is found. It is the totality of these data that I had in mind when I opened this review by referring to "the massive amount of excellent work that went into the production of this new dictionary." This approach to the Hebrew vocabulary represents a major departure from all previous efforts in the field of Hebrew lexicography. But I also referred at the outset to the faults and failings of DCH, and it is to these that I now turn my attention. First, one must question very seriously the decision not to include cognate material. I include here several samples of errors which can arise from such omissions. The hapax legomenon D't? in Isa 19:3 is listed as a plural noun meaning "ghosts" under the entry 'i.p (in brackets to indicate that the form is not attested) with the note "sg. perh. Og or Og" (p. 202). Attention to etymology, however, reveals that the word is a borrowing from Akkadian e.temmu "spirit of the dead."' While it is true that native Hebrew speakers may have understood m'tr as a plural noun, there certainly is no absolute proof of this. Since in origin the mem is part of the word, listing the entry under 'p. and suggesting the above singular forms are both inappropriate. Similarly, DCH assumes that the famous crux mrl,t in Deut 33:2 is to be understood as comprising the vocables I,, "fire" and nT "law," though at least the partial disclaimer "appar." is added (p. 401). But a glance at etymology reveals, as any Hebraist knows, that nT is a Persian loanword in Hebrew. Do the editors of DCH assume that Deuteronomy 33 was authored in the Persian period? Clearly the poem is much earlier, and obviously nirv means something else.3 As these two examples plainly indicate, lexicographical research cannot proceed as if the language in question existed in a vacuum. If the editors wish to eschew cognates, fine, but at the very least loanwords demand special attention. The user of the dictionary is entitled to know, for example, that the hapax legomenon pt "linen" in Prov 7:16 is a loanword from Egyptian, 2. Cf. H. R. [C.] Cohen, Biblical Hapax Legonzena in the Light of Akkadian and Ugaritic (Missoula, Mont., 1978), p. 42. 3. For a survey of opinions, see G. A. Rendsburg, "Hebrew T'dt and Ugaritic idymn," Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages 8 (1980): 81-84.</page><page sequence="4">114 GARY A. RENDSBURG especially since this word occurs in the construct phrase ,'1t T1u in its only attestation (as DCH notes [p. 202]). Similarly, the reader would be enlightened to learn that the hapax legomenon I'niM'tM "her towers" in Jer 50:15 (listed under in,v in brackets [p. 413]) is a loanword from Akkadian as tu,4 an important point in light of the fact that the sole occurrence of this word appears in the prophet's oracle to Babylon as an example of what I call addressee-switching. And, of course, a variety of Persian loanwords attested only in books of the exilic period should be so indicated. The editors may respond to my criticism with their aforecited statement that "attention is paid primarily not to the unusual and difficult words but to the common words." But this disclaimer is no compensation for the kind of omissions (and, in some cases, errors) that I am pointing out regarding rare words. Furthermore, cognate evidence sometimes affects our understanding even of common words. DCH continues the time-honored tradition of translating ;nW. as "fire offering" (p. 411). But Ugaritic instructs us that we are dealing with different roots, for in this language "fire" is ist, and the rarer word itt means "gift, offering."5 Thus, .W should be disassociated from ttxr and instead should be rendered "gift, offering" with no connection to fire. I turn now to another issue. The editors decided to close their corpus at 200 C.E. The reason for this is clear: to have adjusted it by another few decades would have entailed incorporating a vast amount of additional material from the Mishnah and the Tosefta (perhaps also various tannaitic midrashim, depending on one's view as to the date of the Mekhilta and other texts). One certainly can empathize with the dilemma, and one can fully understand why these materials were not included in the corpus. To have included tannaitic sources would have made the project all the more massive, and I can imagine that many more years would have passed before this first volume appeared. And yet if the editors were fully to be faithful to their goal of producing a dictionary that "differs from traditional Hebrew lexica in that it designates and defines a phase of the language as Classical Hebrew" (p. 14), they would have included tannaitic texts as well. The phase of the language known alternatively as Mishnaic Hebrew or more properly Tannaitic Hebrew is part and parcel of Classical Hebrew. Some may argue otherwise; but everyone, I 4.

To illustrate this point, in its entry for ',nxR "guarantor" (p. 195), DCH lists just one attestation, Murabba'at 30 2:24. But this word occurs several additional times in the Mishnah and Tosefta, and the user of DCH would benefit from this knowledge. Again, I understand how much more work would have been involved by extending DCH's corpus to the Mishnah and related texts; but on the other hand the database already exists in microfiche form in The Historical Dictionary of the Hebrew Language: Materials for the Dictionary, Series I: 200 BCE-300 CE (Jerusalem, 1988), produced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language. In fact, the editors state that they utilized this valuable resource for most of the Dead Sea Scrolls vocabulary (p. 31). Another criticism I shall raise concerns emendations. The editors of DCH decided "as a rule to include all emendations that are adopted" in BDB, KB/HALAT, and BHS (p. 17). "But we never say whether we agree with an emendation or not; . . . our policy has been to avoid making judgments on such issues" (ibid.). I am in full agreement with this position, but one must question why list proposed emendations at all. The editors state clearly that "unlike previous dictionaries [DCH] has a theoretical base in modem linguistics" (p. 14). I know of no linguistic approach which would waste time and space dealing with proposed emendations. Avi Hurvitz is absolutely correct when he states that "a linguistic study whose central purpose is to seek facts and avoid conjectures, should base itself on actual texts--difficult though they may be-rather than depend on reconstructed texts."6 And while I do not accuse DCH of basing itself on emendations, the very mentioning of them in the entries of individual words will lead users of the dictionary away from the work's stated goal. There are some very useful features in this work. Each entry begins with the number of occurrences in each of the subcorpora. For example, we learn that p) occurs 790.55.228.3 times, referring, respectively, to the Bible, Ben Sira, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and inscriptions. In addition there is an exhaustive table listing "Words Beginning with Aleph in Order of Frequency" (pp. 67-88), taking us from the ubiquitous nr with 11,826 occurrences to the several hundred instances of words which occur only once (most of these are proper names). 6. A Linguistic Study, of the Relationship Between the Priestly Source and the Book of Ezekiel (Paris, 1982), p. 19.</page><page sequence="6">116 GARY A. RENDSBURG As just indicated in the parenthetic remark, DCH includes all proper names, both personal names and toponyms. The former appear in large numbers not only in the Bible, but also in inscriptions, especially seals. It is a major advance of this dictionary to include all such data. When we combine this exhaustiveness with the distribution given, we learn at an instant that a name such as "1rn, occurring 0.0.0.3 times, appears only in inscriptions. The entry then lists the specific occurrences, one of which is in Arad ostracon 21 and two of which are on seals (p. 290). Toponyms are included with specific geographic information where available. Thus, for example, since little or nothing is known about aDn, the entry states simply "second station of exodus" (p. 461); in contrast to the entry for Mum, which states "town in Jordan Valley, appar. ident. with Adamah, T. ed-Damye, S of confluence of Jabbok and Jordan" (p. 129). The volume closes with a reverse English-Hebrew index. It appears that only words representing primary glosses are included. Thus, for example, to cite some of the words discussed below, neither "lamb" nor "army" is listed in this index. I append here comments on selected entries, recognizing fully that some of my remarks devolve from attention to cognate usage (I have omitted references to secondary literature): 1u/wS: This Ketiv/Qere occurs in Prov 31:4, but means neither "or" (p. 147) nor "where?" (p. 202). The best interpretation is "any" (related to the negative particle ') "not") as both the context and the Ugaritic cognate ay demonstrate. 1at (p. 151): The gloss given is "body or perh. belly"; but given the use of this word in Ugaritic, specifically in Krt 88, 178, where it refers to a large army, the meaning "body" is assured and "belly" can be dismissed. 1m (p. 164): DCH errs in continuing the identification of Ur of the Chaldees with the famous Ur "in southern Babylon, on right bank of Euphrates, mod. T. el-Muqayyar." There simply is no evidence for this identification. Instead, Abraham's Ur should be identified with modem Urfa in southern Turkey (near Harran), which not only accords with local Jewish and Muslim tradition, but truly is "beyond the River," to use the biblical expression. p~t "weigh" (p. 170): Somewhere the reader should be apprised that the Semitic root of "weigh" is wzn, not to be confused with the word for "ear,</page><page sequence="7">THE SHEFFIELD DICTIONARY OF CLASSICAL HEBREW 117 hear," whose root is 'dn. Note that these two words have only one root consonant in common. ?:?t "eat" (pp. 240-245): Somewhere in this long entry should be a reference to the sexual usage of this verbal root, seen most clearly in Prov 30:20, but also in Gen 39:6 and perhaps in Exod 2:20. z'iM (pp. 277-286, especially p. 286): The word appears 2,848 times in the corpus. According to DCH it always means "God, god, gods, etc.," except in 1 Sam 28:13 r1" jp I, Y vwl', t'Lt, where DCH uses the gloss "ghost," though it renders the phrase "a god (Samuel) I have seen rising from the ground." This is an admittedly difficult phrase, but the usage is clear. In Egypt and elsewhere in antiquity, and no doubt in popular belief in ancient Israel, the dead were considered divine. These words in the mouth of the medium of Endor indicate that she considered the deceased to be gods, and in any case the plural verb shows that et,,rM needs to be a plural subject. I suggest "gods (i.e., the deified dead) I have seen rising from the ground." tlap, (p. 300): This word is a hapax appearing in Prov 30:31. The gloss reads "God, i.e. var. of aI,,.," after which appear several suggestions based mainly on emendations. Only at the end of the entry does DCH note "the army" as a possibility. In my estimation, this is the only meaning that makes any sense in the context, though "the kinsfolk" or "the tribe" would be more precise. This understanding is based on Arabic, where the phrase al-qawm means "the kinsfolk" or "the tribe." Note that Prov 30:1-31:9 are the words of Massaite kings of the Syrian Desert, whose language in antiquity would have had much in common with both Aramaic and Arabic, as a quick glance at these chapters demonstrates. This factor explains the presence of a pure Arabism in the Bible. "i 'nnx ?E: This phrase occurs in Gen 49:21 and has elicited much dis- cussion. DCH assumes it means "words of beauty" (p. 326) or through emendation "branches/antlers of beauty" (p. 314), and only tertiarily suggests "lambs of beauty." I find this last interpretation the most convincing by far, and the word deserves its own entry (on p. 326 under .nN the reader is directed elsewhere). The word is cognate to the common Aramaic word for "lamb," and it is no surprise to see this lexeme in the words about Naphtali, one of the northernmost tribes. It stands, therefore, as an exemplar of Israelian Hebrew. *,x "hero" (p. 365) and ?'I?. "altar hearth" (p. 377): Somewhere the reader should learn that 5tv"t occurs in Mesha Stele, line 12, which has been interpreted as either of these rare words.</page><page sequence="8">118 GARY A. RENDSBURG I am quite sure that the scholars responsible for this dictionary will read my review and claim that I have misunderstood their goals of concentrating on uses of words instead of meanings, and of devoting most of their efforts to the common words in the language. I understand these points; I commend the researchers involved in this project for the major strides taken to achieving their stated goals; and I recognize the major contributions that this important reference work makes. My negative comments are a reaction mainly to the claim that cognates "are strictly irrelevant to the Hebrew language," as I hope to have demonstrated in this essay. Admittedly I have concentrated my -efforts in this review on the rare words in the language, something which DCH professes not to have done. But then one might ask, why bother including rare words at all, especially the hundreds of proper names? If the dictionary wished to deal mainly with the uses of a word, and not its meanings, presumably a critical mass of data is necessary by which to ascertain such information. The point is that DCH chose to be exhaustive, and to include all words in the language (as opposed to dealing only with words which occur, let us say, at least ten times in the corpus). Having made that choice, I believe that the project needs to devote additional energies to these rarer lexemes, and of course it is specifically these items which require an eye to cognate usages. In sum, one is tempted to recall H. L. Ginsberg's dictum concerning Ugaritic studies and apply it to Clines and his staff: the only ones who have not made errors in writing dictionaries are those who have not attempted to do so. Clines himself anticipated some of the criticisms of this essay with the following words: "Critics can easily think of many things we might have done, and blame us for these omissions. They have already started to make such criticisms, and most of their criticisms are valid. In the end, though, we have to say that we prefer our way of writing a Hebrew dictionary to their way of not writing a Hebrew dictionary" (p. 10). Yet, at the same time, I cannot help but feel that just a little more work in selected areas would have increased the value of this project immensely.
