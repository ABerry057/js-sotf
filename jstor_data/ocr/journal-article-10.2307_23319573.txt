The term "black slavery" is used for reasons of accuracy, with no intention of disrespect. The texts discussed in this article deal with African slaves transported to many colonies in the New World before, during, and after the Atlantic crossing as well as slaves bom into slavery on the American con tinent and some in colonies on the African continent—e.g., black slaves on plantations in Senegal. Although "African American" is more politically acceptable today, in the case of the persons described herein this term does not provide an accurate description, as is also true of the term "African." Likewise, since the skin color of the slaves was such a significant defining factor during the period in which these texts were composed, it is appropriate to use "black" here. 2. For a detailed discussion of blacks in American Yiddish literature, see Isaac E. Rontch, Amerike in der yidisher literatur [America in Yiddish Literature: An Interpretation] (New York: Martin Press, 1945), 203-55; Merle Lyn Bachman, "American Yiddish Poetry's Encounter with Black America," Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies 21, no. 1 (2002): 3-24; and Bachman, Recovering "Yiddishland": Threshold Moments in American Literature (New York: Syra cuse University Press, 2008), 114-73. 3. Parallels between black and Jewish experiences have been drawn frequently since the ante bellum period. As Hasia Diner notes, since much American rhetoric of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries reflects the Old Testament heritage of the Puritans, the image of black slaves as the Children of Israel was used repeatedly in sermons, editorials, literature, and other media by blacks and white abolitionists alike. These parallels were similarly drawn in Yiddish prose and poetry of the early twentieth century; Diner writes in In the Almost Promised Land (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1995), 20-21: "decades after Emancipation American Jews would point with pride to the fact that the Old Testament had been an inspiration to the cause of abolitionism." For a modern academic com parison of the situations of the Jews in Europe and the blacks in America, see Robert Phillipson, The Identity Question (Jackson: University of Mississippi, 2001), ix-xii. 43</page><page sequence="2">Rebecca Wolpe traders.4 Jonathan Schorsch claims that "under the sign of the Haskala...little changed" in this respect.5 In discussing a reference by Isaac Satanov to black slavery, Schorsch notes: One cannot gauge from this brief comment whether Satanov knew about the abolitionist movements beginning to agitate in England and France at the time. Satanov's reportage was remarkably non-committal, betraying little, if any, sympathy for these developments.6 In addition to Schorsch,7 other researchers also contend that Jews in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century continental Europe had only "the scantiest exposure to color and race differences before migrating to the United States."8 According to Diner they may have heard of blacks through letters from friends in the United States; or, if they had visited London, Vienna, Berlin, or Paris, they may have been aware of the political debates on race relations. Likewise, European Jewish readers would have encountered blacks in literature and what Diner calls other "spotty sources of information"—in the newspaper Forverts that reached Europe, through the work of some American novelists published in Warsaw and Vilna, or in the Hebrew and Yiddish translations of Uncle Tom's Cabin published in the nineteenth century.9 The subject of black slavery appears to have been distant both geographi cally and practically from nineteenth-century European Jewry. Yet an examination of maskilic literature published in that period demonstrates that knowledge of blacks and black slavery was less "spotty" than Diner has suggested. Although Satanov's comment as examined by Schorsch may not indicate opposition to slavery or knowledge of abolitionist movements, both of these did appear in the writings of other maskilim. Indeed, not only did the plight of black Americans strike "a responsive chord in Jews in Europe,"10 but from the early nineteenth century staunch opposition to the slave trade as well as, in some cases, abolitionist views are to be found in references to and at times lengthy discussions of the raging debate on slavery current in European politics in the compositions of 4. On Jewish involvement in the slave trade see, e.g., Jonathan Schorsch, Swimming the Chris tian Atlantic: Judeoconversos, Afroiberians and Amerindians in the Seventeenth Century (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2009); Schorsch, Jews and Blacks in the Early Modern World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); and Iris Idelson-Shein, '"Blessed is the Changer of Beings': Uses and Representations of 'the Exotic' in the Jewish Enlightenment" (PhD diss., Tel Aviv University, 2010), 3-5. 5.

Although some academics have noted maskilic opposition to slavery, the phenomenon has not yet been ana lyzed sufficiently as a topic worthy of academic discussion in and of itself.11 This article will explore the motif of maskilic opposition to black slavery by discussing the sources of this apparent convention through an analysis of its recurrence in one specific maskilic literary oeuvre: sea adventures.12 Although the topics of black slavery and colonialism and the descriptions of non-European peoples are obviously interconnected, this article will focus only on the issue of black slavery. First of all, it is impossible to do justice to these three major topics in the space of one short article. Furthermore, support for treating these topics separately arises from the sources themselves. Many enlightenment thinkers, and the maskilim in particular, clearly distinguished between the issues of slavery and colonialism. While slavery was unjustifiable, colonizing activities were not only justifiable but often endorsed. As Sankar Muthu has noted in his extensive study, Enlightenment against Empire", "virtually every prominent and influential European thinker in the three hundred years before the eighteenth century and nearly the full century after it were either agnostic toward or enthu siastically in favor of imperialism." Indeed, any attacks on imperialism "generally decried the abuses of imperial power, but not the imperial mission itself," a gen eralization that applies to the corpus under analysis herein.13 Likewise, objections to the treatment of slaves and campaigns for abolition did not translate directly into a belief that non-European or nonwhite peoples (including not only Africans but also native Americans and Asians) were equal to Europeans and should be treated as such. Abolitionists did not necessarily support granting full rights to peoples they regarded as "savages." Despite many romanticized images of what has come to be known as "the noble savage," abolitionists regarded non-European cultures for the most part as inferior and believed they should be supplanted by European civilization.14 Maskilic writers sought to associate themselves, and the Jewish people as a whole, with Europeans; yet many maskilim in fact viewed the Jewish masses as savages: ignor ant and superstitious, and in need of civilizing by the maskilim, who in effect became the European colonizers. In Robinzon: Di geshikhte fun alter leb, avne vare und vunder bare geshikhte tsum unterhalt und zur belerung (Galicia, ca. 1820),15 for example, Yosef Vitlin critiques various Jewish (in this case, Hasidic) 11. See Idelson-Shein, '"Blessed is the Changer of Beings,'" 171. 12. For a discussion of maskilic commentary on black slavery outside of sea adventures, see ibid., 170-78. 13. Sankar Muthu, Enlightenment against Empire (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003), 1-4. 14. On the noble savage, see, e.g., Ter Ellingson, The Myth of the Noble Savage (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001). 15. The first (and incomplete) edition of the anonymous Robinson, The Story of Alter Leb: A True and Wonderful Story for Entertainment and Instruction (Alter Leb) held by the National Library of Israel was printed in Lvov in 1850/51. However, this is not the first edition of the work, which Leah Garrett dates to 1820. The fact that Shlomo Ettinger, writing in the 1830s, refers to a Yiddish translation of Robinson Crusoe titled ''wb'?}* indicates that the earliest edition was published 45</page><page sequence="4">Rebecca Wolpe traits through his descriptions of the savage Shabbes, who he censures for his superstition as well as other negative traits. Such an accusation was. common among opponents of the Hasidic movement. Menahem Mendel Lefin offers similar social criticism of the Jewish masses through the medium of non-European peoples in his treatment of the Pelew Islanders in Masa'ot ha-yam (Zolkiew, 1818).16 In their discussions of non-European peoples, maskilic writers often used the education and transformation of the savage to symbolize the process necessary to transform the European Jewish masses into functional members of European society. For Vitlin, Shabbes's improvement from uneducated, uncivi lized, and superstitious to rational, civilized, and thinking represents the potential of Eastern European Jewry to improve themselves, while Lefin continuously praises the Pelew islanders' interest in everything European and their desire to learn.17 These trends, however, are not found in discussions of slavery. Iris Idelson-Shein contends that opposition to black slavery was an intellec tual convention, or a fashion, among maskilic writers, suggesting that their lack of direct contact with slavery perhaps facilitated the development of their opposition to it. She claims likewise that the maskilim's expressions of opposition to slavery do not indicate feelings of solidarity with the oppressed that reflect the low Jewish status within Europe and illustrate their own desire for emancipation. Rather, they are a consequence of the maskilim's identification with the Europeans and Euro pean patronage.18 An analysis of the texts under study here is partly in agreement with her findings, but suggests a different purpose for their references to black slavery. These texts show no indication that the Jews saw in the oppression of slaves any parallel to their own status in Europe, and in fact none of the writers compare their own, however problematic, situation to that of a slave. At the same time, however, their discussions of black slavery were not simply a conven tion or an attempt to emulate non-Jewish writers and thinkers, but were included in maskilic works to impart education and ethical lessons. In the writings of Isaac Meir Dik we also find hints of political commentary in his discussions of slavery. Haskalah Literature: Aims and Methods The Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah, was a movement of many faces, locations, and ideologies, beginning in Germany in the second half of the well before the extant one. Ber Shlosberg's 1937 identification of Yosef Vitlin, a Galician maskil, as the translator has been followed by Dov Sadan, David Roskies, and Leah Garrett, who has discussed this adaptation at length in her article "The Jewish Robinson Crusoe," Comparative Literature 54, no. 3 (2000): 215—28. See M. Weiner, Tsu der geshikhte fun der yidisher literatur in 19tn yohrhundert (New York: YKUF, 1945), 255; and Garrett, "Jewish Robinson Crusoe," 216. 16. Lefin's Masa 'ot ha-yam and the anonymous (although attributed to Lefin)'Oniyah so'arah are not discussed herein since they do not contain commentary on black slavery. 17. This issue is discussed in my forthcoming doctoral dissertation, The Sea and Sea Voyage in Maskilic Literature. 18.

The Haskalah movement was never a formal organization but comprised groups of Jews seeking to change the values of their society and to "normalize" European Jewry in keeping with current European trends, within limits that would prevent the annihilation of Judaism. In Shmuel Feiner's words, the maskilim "assigned themselves the historic task of leading their brethren in the transition from the epoch of immaturity to the epoch of matur ity."19 As such, the maskilim's aims were to "reshape and re-form Judaism and the Jews in accordance with the needs of modern times and the requirements of the European Enlightenment milieu."20 In practice, despite many programs of com prehensive reform drawn up by maskilim, they worked primarily in the fields of culture, literature, and education.21 The maskilim sought to expand Jewish education beyond traditional Torah study to embrace modern languages, sciences, and history.22 This mission of edu cating the Jewish people would be achieved both through the founding of new enlightened schools23 and through literary means, using instructional texts and works of belles lettres that were entertaining but also contained edifying material: pleasurable instruction.24 19.

In Divrei shalom ve-'emet (1782) Naphtali Herz Wessely suggested that the study of the humanities has an intrinsic value and is not subordinate to that of Torah—rather it should be either equal to or above the latter in terms of importance, since it is vital to the understanding of religion. He outlined the need to study the law of humans—language and grammar (both Hebrew and German), social behavior, and good manners—alongside the law of God, i.e., the Bible, religious pre cepts, the Talmud, and rabbinic literature. 23.

In addition, the Haskalah produced numerous treatises and primers for children that dealt specifically with the questions of ethics....28 This concern with moral improvement resulted in part from external criti cism of Jewish morality: the maskilim sought to encourage Jews to embrace the values of Bildung and enlightenment. By embracing these values, Jews would improve themselves, enabling them to fully enter European society. For example, Mendel Lefin's Heshbon ha-nefesh discusses the importance of (among other qualities) calmness, patience, order, cleanliness, justice, frugality, diligence, silence, tranquillity, and truth;29 and in Masa'ot ha-yam Lefin returns to many of these qualities. Humanist values of tolerance and love of one's fellow human being also took on significant roles in maskilic works, especially in translations of the works of Joachim Heinrich Campe. As part of their role as musar preachers, the maskilim frequently expressed allegiance to their states of residence and their desire to become fully functioning members of these societies. Such expressions are also to be found in literary 25. On this, see, e.g., Nancy Sinkoff, Tradition and Transition: Mendel Lefin of Satanow and the Beginnings of Jewish Enlightenment in Eastern Europe, 1749-1826 (PhD diss., Columbia Univer sity, 1996), 93—94; and Garrett, "Jewish Robinson Crusoe," 224. 26. See Harris Bor, "Enlightenment Values, Jewish Ethics: The Haskalah's Transformation of the Traditional Musar Genre," in Feiner and Sorkin, New Perspectives, 48-63. Bor describes musar as the "theoretical underpinning for halakhah" or "theological grounding for religious life" (49-52). Musar literature, especially the kabbalistic ethical works popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth cen turies, also voiced social criticism, attacking religious or moral laxity and aiming to rouse readers to repentance, greater observance, and intense piety. The focus of most of this literature was on the after life, and works often advocated ascetic penitence and used threats of punishment to invoke fear, as opposed to love, of God. Maskilic writers sought to move away from these views and inspire their readers to love God. Musar literature became an area in which maskilim could innovate without tres passing into the more sensitive domain of halakhah. Maskilim also began to associate morality with the Haskalah, stressing the importance of social improvement. As Bor notes, "In the Enlightenment period political, philosophical, religious, and scientific developments merged to shape a climate dedicated to a worldly morality based on rational principles." 27.

For example, in Hame'asef one finds many poems, in both Hebrew and German, dedicated to Frederick II of Prussia and others in praise of the Austro Hungarian monarch Joseph II, who issued the Toleranzpatent in 1781. However, while the aim of German works was to provide evidence of Jewish loyalty to non-Jewish readers and their leaders, the goal of the Hebrew works praising the Prussian monarch was to foster similar feelings among Jewish readers. By describing and praising the acts of governments and monarchs, mas kilic writers sought to arouse in their fellow Jews the desire to become useful members of the societies where they resided.30 To accomplish this complex combination of aims, the maskilim in Germany at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century turned to German literary sources.31 They found a perfect vehicle in the works of Joachim Heinrich Campe, a pedagogue and one of the first German writers of chil dren's literature;32 they turned especially to his "sea adventures," which combine exciting adventure stories with general and moral edification.33 The corpus under study here consists of Hebrew and Yiddish translations34 of Joachim Heinrich Campe's Die Entdeckung von Amerika, Sammlung 30. On this, see Lederhendler, Modern Jewish Politics, 125 ff; and Israel Zinberg, A History of Jewish Literature, ed. and trans. Bernard Martin (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1972-78), 10:32-33; Zinberg, however, suggests that these comments reflect the maskilim's belief that the government was protecting them. 31.

This term is used by David Roskies; see, e.g., "The Medium and Message of the Maskilic (Yiddish) Chapbook," Jewish Social Studies 41, no. 3/4 (1979): 275-90. The term designates the corpus under study here whose recurring characteristics include: the central presence of the sea, elements of the adventure genre (see Martin Green, Seven Types of Adventure Tale: An Etiology of a Major Genre [Philadelphia: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991]); and shared ideological, and especially pedagogical, aims. However, the works also exhibit many influences from other genres. On the difficulty of categorizing texts according to literary genres, see, e.g., David Fishelov, "Genre Theoiy and Family Resemblance—Revisited," Poetics 20 (1991): 123-38; and Mary Gerhart, "The Dilemma of the Text: How to 'Belong' to a Genre," Poetics 18 (1989): 355-73. 34. Although the term "translation" is used here, these are free reworkings and not close trans lations of Campe's works. They remove and add material, make changes in the narrative and plot, and often Judaize the source text. See Rebecca Wolpe, "Judaizing Robinson Crusoe.

This combination was apparently very successful: maskilic writers continued to use this recipe until the late nineteenth century, and further editions were pub lished in the early twentieth century. Enlightenment Europe and the Debate on Slavery As Dorinda Outram explains, slavery is as old as human society itself, and until the Enlightenment was almost universally accepted: Slavery has existed as the most extreme form of unfree labor in most human societies. It has assumed a myriad of legal, economic and social forms, and still exists today in many countries. Slavery has not only existed in almost The Sea Voyage Narrative as an Educational Tool in the Early Haskalah (Master's thesis, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005). 35. There are seven extant Jewish adaptations of Robinson derJiingere (see Wolpe, "Judaizing Robinson Crusoe") and five of Die Entdeckung (see Wolpe, Sea Voyage Narrative). Six of Campe's works were adapted by maskilim for Jewish readerships: Robinson der Jiingere, Die Entdeckung von Amerika, Theophron oder der erfahrne Rathgeber fur die unerfahrne Jugend, Sittenbiichlein fur Kinder aus gesitteten Standen, MerkwiXrdge Reisebeschreibungen, and excerpts from Sammlung inter essanter und durchgdngig zweckmafiig abgefafiter Reisebeschreibungen fur die jugend. Robinson der Jiingere, Die Entdeckung von Amerika, and excerpts from Sammlung were the most popular. The first two have been adapted by various writers. All three have been published in numerous editions.

Even the Greek philosopher Aristotle argues that for some men, slavery was natural to their being. In the centuries between Aristotle and the Enlightenment no one argued that the slave's lot was enviable, and many had pleaded for the more humane treatment of slaves. But it was not until the eighteenth century that there were more than isolated attacks on the institution of slavery itself.38 Almost from the beginning of the importation of Africans to the newly dis covered Americas in 1518 an ongoing ideological discourse raged on the issue of the slave trade. The renowned seventeenth-century Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius claimed that slavery is an unnatural state, yet justified it on the basis of Roman law, which permits the enslavement of various classes of people, among them prisoners of war and paupers. This is clearly preferable to the other option that faced prisoners of war: slaughter. Moral and religious arguments were also advanced by Christian theologians and merchants: the strongest of these was undoubtedly based on the "Ham ideology," which linked the African peoples directly to Ham, who was cursed by Noah to become a slave.39 From the beginning of the eighteenth century onward, increasing numbers of political thinkers, philosophers, and economists attacked the institution of slavery, arguing that slavery was a sin, "tantamount to stealing humans and... therefore a contravention of the eighth commandment."40 Montesquieu main tained that Grotius's justification of slavery as preferable to slaughter was no longer relevant. Many economists also advanced arguments against slavery, even if they did not oppose the institution of slavery itself. In 1752, for example, David Hume contended that the disproportionate ratio of slaves to free men created insecurity and the need for severe discipline. Some deemed slavery to be more expensive than free labor, claiming that it also deprived the poor of necessary employment and enfeebled the rich with luxury and the pursuit of wealth. Many economic thinkers argued that free labor on the part of contented workers was preferable to slavery.41 However, in the writings of Hume, the Marquis de Mirabeau, Benjamin Franklin, and others, despite their arguments against slavery, one finds no concern with the situation of the black slaves or any interest in abolitionism: their arguments are solely based on economic considerations.42 38.

Although the ideals of the Enlightenment—among others, equality, freedom, and controls on arbitrary power—would seem to condemn the institution of slavery, which treated human beings as no more than possessions, its existence continued to be tolerated, and in the eighteenth century the importation of slaves from Africa to the colonies in the Caribbean, Brazil, and America had reached its height. For enlightenment thinkers, slavery presented something of a paradox; enlightenment ideals could in fact serve both defenders and opponents of slavery. The issue also played into the larger concerns of the time—the authority of the central government, conservative nobility, tyranny, and the enslavement of the European peoples. The abolition of slavery could be perceived, on the one hand, as an act of tyranny in itself and, on the other, as an assertion of the central government's control over landowners.43 As Outram concludes, for enlightenment thinkers, "treating people as commodities, slavery raised more sharply than before such questions as the definition of a person, and the impor tance, both economic and political, of property"; yet to question the institution of slavery was not only to suggest dismantling a massive, global economic enter prise but also to allow government control over individual interests. By the middle of the eighteenth century, slavery "was increasingly being seen, even by ordinary people, not only as cruel and wrong, but also as somehow unalterable..."; "it is not difficult to see why anti-slavery mobilization took so long to come together."44 The debates were also troubled by constant contradictions relating to the development of racial thinking and the concept of "what is a man." Even those advocating the abolition of slavery often claimed that blacks were inferior in terms of intellect and moral behavior and thus should not be allowed to enter fully into society or mate with whites. Skin color became a defining characteristic; black, with its connotations of gloom, darkness, and misfortune, became a symbol for bad, and white a symbol for good. Some scientists asserted that blackness was an aberration (white being the norm and black the deviation from that norm), others that it was a kind of illness or skin disease. Hume suggested that extremes of climate accounted for the inferiority of nations in certain areas: according to him, blacks were naturally inferior and had produced no civilized nations, no eminent individuals in the arts and sciences, and no government. The "assertion of racial inferiority cloaked in the cautious, reasoned language of science" was used to justify black slavery 45 By no means all thinkers were of this opinion, however; standing against it were the founder of the Methodist movement, John Wesley, and philosopher Adam Smith, who in 1764 provoked reactions from advocates of slavery and black inferiority with his provocative comment that 43.

Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when she subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails of Europe.46 It is interesting to note that despite his concerns with liberty, his hatred of servitude, and his notion of the "good savage,"47 Jean Jacques Rousseau never mentioned the problem of black slavery; his name was noticeably missing from a list of French abolitionists. Rousseau considered the blacks to be merely a tiny minority of enslaved humanity; he attacked instead a much more "extensive" slavery in his comment in the introduction to his Social Contract that "[m]an was born free, and everywhere he is in chains." This is reinforced by Rousseau's comment else where that "civil man is born, lives, and dies in slavery" and in his discussion of enslavement to despots. Yet many comments in The Social Contract were applied to the fight against black slavery—for example "no man has natural auth ority over his fellow," or "the words slave and right contradict each other, and are mutually exclusive." 48 Many of the French abolitionists were Rousseau's disciples. From Traditional Jewish Attitudes toward Slavery to Maskilic Abolitionism Over the past two decades increasing attempts have been made to target Judaism, and in particular the biblical curse of Ham, as the source of antiblack prejudice in Western civilization,49 and to claim that Christianity and Islam then adopted it from Judaism. According to the biblical text, Ham "saw his father's nak edness" when Noah was drunk. Upon waking, Noah cursed Ham's son Canaan:50 (Genesis 9:25) rnx1? mrr tnny las? ins And he said: Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.51 46.

Ham and the dog copulated in the Ark and were punished.52 David Goldenberg discusses the textual evidence produced by scholars who claim that antiblack sentiment is pervasive in rabbinic literature. He describes this evidence as "meager," occurring in only a tiny percentage of rabbinic writings that express the views of individual writers; and he concludes that these texts in no way reflect some overall "talmudic" view of blacks. Discussions of blacks in rabbinic sources are etiological, explaining the existence of different skin colors, and if the sources do express derogatory views of blacks, it is in all likelihood due to a preference for the surrounding racial norm, which is white.53 Goldenberg goes on to note that the argument "hinges on the assumed linkage of blackness and slavery. But such linkage is not found in the Bible or later Jewish literature.... Slavery and dark skin are two independent etiological myths. Nowhere in early Jewish literature.... is that distinction violated."54 In fact, Abraham ibn Ezra spoke out against the Muslim claim that blacks are slaves because of Noah's curse on Ham. Indeed, the link between slavery and black skin did not occur in Judaism but rather, according to Goldenberg, among Islamic writers from the seventh century onward and in societies that institutiona lized black slavery. "When Blacks became identified with the slave class in the Islamic world and in the Christian world after the fifteenth century, the etiology was dusted off and reborn as the 'Curse of Ham' in order to justify the social struc tures."55 In rabbinic literature, on the contrary, Goldenberg argues, the perception of blacks is generally positive. The issue of black slavery may appear very distant, geographically and socially, from the maskilim in Germany at the beginning of the nineteenth 52. J. Theodor and Ch.

Among the literary works in which maskilic writers discoursed at length on this subject were translations of Campe's Die Entdeckung von Amerika and Robinson der Jiingere. Die Entdeckung von Amerika (The Discovery of America), first published in 1781, is a three-part work describing the discovery of America by Columbus and the conquests of Mexico by Hernan Cortes and of Peru by Francisco Pizarro. This pedagogically directed work of creative nonfiction presents a historical narrative by way of conversations between a father and his children, with digressions to explain various matters of educational interest. It is almost impossible to categor ize this work within a certain genre: it combines elements of sea stories, geo graphical works, historical narratives, biographies, and moral tracts. The same is true of Campe's 1779 reworking of Robinson Crusoe, Robinson der Jiingere,56 which is also told through a series of dialogues but is put forth as a pedagogical tract rather than a novel. In both the works, the sea is a major force and factor, enabling travel, discovery, and conquest; wreaking havoc; and causing death and destruction; yet at the same time bringing life, vitality, and connection. Because the sea is also the medium that must be crossed to transport African slaves to the New World, it enables the discussion of slavery in both of these works. Campe condemns the slave trade but applies a caveat to his descriptions of the institution of black slavery in the New World that is typical of enlightenment ambivalence, as he expresses his awareness of the sugar plantations' importance for the world economy and the provision of food.57 In volume 1 of Die Entdeck ung, Campe first describes in detail the treatment of native Americans and then relates how the decision was made to import slaves from West Africa when the native population had become so depleted that the work force needed 56. For further details, see Wolpe, "Judaizing Robinson CrusoeAngelika Reinhard, Die Kar riere des Robinson Crusoe vom literarischen zum padagogischen Helden: Eine literaturwissenschaf tliche Untersuchung des Robinson Defoes und der Robinson-Adaptionen von Campe und Forster (Frankfurt am Main: Lang, 1994); Elisabeth Stambor, L 'entree de Robinson Crusoe dans la litterature enfantine: naissance du mythe, de De Foe a Campe, 1719-1779 (Master's thesis, Tel Aviv University, 1992). 57. It is interesting to note that Elizabeth Helme, the English translator of Die Entdeckung (Columbus or The Discovery of America as Related by a Father to his Children [London, 1818]), 245, adds a footnote on this issue, in which she strongly disagrees with Campe and takes an even stron ger antislavery stance: "The translator must differ in opinion from Mr. Campe, and consider it as a per nicious thought, for those millions of pounds of sugar cannot surely be put in competition with the numberless barbarities the culture of that plant has occasioned, any more than can the luxury of Eur opeans be considered of sufficient consequence to be purchased at the yearly expense of the lives of thousands of their fellow creatures. In the eye of the world, the death of a few negroes may be immater ial; but in the eye of God, will it not be the death of men and brethren, who, however destitute of exter nal advantages, and deficient in the refinements of education, are equally estimable in his sight as the polished European?" Campe is a clear supporter of colonialism, as is apparent from his discussions of its benefits for both Europeans and the "conquered nations" in volumes 2 and 3 of Die Entdeckung. 55</page><page sequence="14">Rebecca Wolpe reinforcement. He expresses emotion about these matters through the reactions of the father/narrator in his discussions with his children, for example, as he deplores the origins of an institution that has caused so much suffering and the loss of freedom and lives, calling it inhuman and a shame for mankind: [U]nd von dieser Zeit an nahm der unmenschliche Sklavenhandel seinen Anfang, der noch bis auf den heutigen Tag, zur Schande der Menschheit, jahr lich fiber vierzigtausenden unserer schwarzen Brfider iher Fleiheit, ihre ganze Glfickseligkeit und selbst ihr Leben kostet. Und dabei blieben die armen Amerikaner nichts destoweniger, was sie waren—armselige, bis auf den Tod gequalte Sklaven.58 In his translation of Die Entdeckung into Hebrew,59 Frankfurt Moses Men delsohn not only reiterates Campe's criticism of slavery, but goes further: he updates his readers on the latest developments in the abolitionist field and con demns both the trade in slaves and more broadly the enslavement of other human beings. He praises the Danish king, who outlawed both the importation of slaves to the Danish West Indies and their export from Danish holdings on the Guinea coast in 1792, long before other empires had made any move toward banning slavery; this set him up as an example to the other monarchs of the world:60 iap'i ,irrn m 'n -ran -ie&gt;x ^pnansn -f?a sin ,DDtran tiki ,pm ,ron "fraa vroY'i 61....p nra "ics pnsa Tnwin sim .ln^ns maipa to □"tinnn annsrt' im And they should learn from the pious, merciful king who is glorious injustice, the king of Denmark, whose spirit was roused by God and called for the freedom of the Negro slaves in all of his kingdom, and he is the first in the world to do so....62 Mendelsohn exaggerates the importance of this edict: it did not abolish slavery in all Danish colonies nor was the ban on the import and export of slaves effective in all colonies. However, this exaggeration only serves to empha size Mendelsohn's opposition to the institution of slavery and his desire to build 58. Joachim Heinrich Campe, Die Entdeckung, 6th ed.

In his article on the subject Daniel Hopkins is not as positive about the Danish king's actions as was Mendelsohn: "The historic prohibition was hailed—and not only in Denmark—as a landmark in the affairs of the human race....

Likewise, it stresses his respect for the king of Denmark and the enlightened moral values that he upholds.63 Haim (Haykl) Hurwitz, who adapted Die Entdeckung into Yiddish for the first time as Zofnas paneyah (Revealer of Hidden Things), published in 1817 in Berdichev, takes a typically mercantile and also somewhat ambivalent perspective, noting, as did Campe, the global importance of sugar production and other pro ducts from the colonies. Although Hurwitz constantly deplores the treatment of native Americans, who were enslaved by the conquering Spaniards and their populations decimated by cruelty, hard work, and disease, his tone when describ ing the slavery of blacks is somewhat resigned, as though black slavery is indeed "unalterable." Although he follows Campe and condemns the slave trade, Hur witz's descriptions are not particularly emotive. -raxnrx tn era px pmm sx-ixnw cuspid ^n's odip1! p'x xpnsx fx oxn ism lis ymsnw ys'ip ixs is Tan iva inrrs avn is? ps .□•antra msn® -isp1? iki is?n dnh oxniN ,px spnsas oxn asms nnsn® ybx ps ,spnsax i»p ,spnss ps pwo:m .cnsiw in dsti i»» tin sxnai® tn o'o ira And in Africa they bought thousands of black people and together with the Indians worked them very hard, and until today people always sell black people from Africa to America; and all the harsh labor that is done in America is done by the blacks, and they are called Negroes. Mordecai Aaron Guenzburg, who translated Die Entdeckung into both Hebrew64 and Yiddish,65 is clearer in expressing his disgust for the slave trade. In his afterwords to both his Hebrew and Yiddish translations, he elaborates on the financial and productive benefits of the colonies (following Campe and akin to Hurwitz), yet he also condemns the slave trade, following Campe. On this, his Hebrew translation is most explicit: man rtD-irf? 7ay maaa ci-Da1? cptma -iasnrf? nxrn nasnnn nx-isnn niftm &gt;rnn raai ■far rutto n:® 'to 'a .□rr'wa ran nsinn rto x1? nrn nvn Tin crtmn ....lias?1?! un-in1?

However, it is an expression of the writer's respect for everything European and enligh tened, and his desire that his readers, and the Jewish people as a whole, aspire to these values. 64.

Another Campe text that expresses his opposition to slavery is his German rework ing of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe into a pedagogical text, Robinson der Jungere.66 In the English novel, the hero, Robinson, spends a number of years as a plantation owner in Brazil, where he owns slaves—an acceptable and standard part of colonial existence. He is shipwrecked on a desert island during a voyage he undertakes with several other plantation owners to purchase slaves from the western coast of Africa to bring to Brazil. In keeping with his ideology, Campe removes all links between Robinson and the slave trade: his hero never reaches Brazil. However, Campe introduces the issue of slavery and enters into a discourse on the subject at another point in the work.67 When a Spanish ship carrying slaves is wrecked off the coast of Robinson's island during a storm, the crew is forced to release the slaves from their chains under the deck so that they can pump water out of the sinking ship. The slaves revolt, rushing to the lifeboat to flee for their lives. Outnumbered by the slaves, the masters are left begging for their own lives: Und hier kan ich nicht umhin, die GroBmuth und Menschlichkeit dieser armen Sklaven zu riihmen. Ohneachtet unser Verfahren gegen sie sehr hart gewesen war, liessen sie sich doch von Mitleid riihren, und erlaubten uns, zu ihnen hinab zu steigen unter der Bedingung, dafi wir keine Waffen mitnahmen. Wir gingen die Bedingung ein und sprangen in die Bote...."68 This text contrasts the humanity of the slaves with the inhumanity of those who had forced them onto the ship and into slavery and describes as well the ter rible conditions in which the slaves are transported across the Atlantic Ocean, packed like herrings. Most of the Hebrew and Yiddish maskilic translations of Robinson der Jungere follow this condemnation of the slave trade. Translators often use the device of the biblical inlay (shibuz), or fragment of a biblical verse, to condemn the slave trade 66. It is of course impossible to discuss the attitude to slavery in Robinson der Jiingere without mention of the character Friday. In Robinson Crusoe Friday is very clearly Robinson's servant, far below his master in hierarchy, able to speak only a pidgin English and totally uncivilized. In Campe's adap tation of Robinson Crusoe Friday remains servant to his master, but the relationship between the two is far more complicated. Friday swiftly learns to speak fluent German and is shown to be capable of all intellec tual pursuits. He excels at certain physical skills far beyond Robinson's abilities; he is able to light a fire whereas Robinson has repeatedly failed to do so; and he saves Robinson from drowning early on in the story. There is an exchange of knowledge and skills between the two men, rather than a simple hierarchy, yet Friday remains a servant. So too the Jewish adaptations of the work follow Campe's characterization of Friday. However, the character of Friday is more relevant to a discussion of colonialism and the approach to the exotic than to a discussion of the institution of black slavery. 67.

Zamosc uses a shibuz associated with the Exodus from Egypt to describe the slaves' escape "from slavery to freedom": nnn1? nvnva.73 In the Yiddish Alter Leb, the hero suggests that the shipwreck was probably an act of God to free the slaves; he condemns the mistreatment of the slaves with harsh descriptions of their physical conditions: they were naked and barefoot, hungry and thirsty, and sold for money to be used for the harshest labor. To describe this labor, the adaptor uses an inlay within a Yiddish text— "ps rnus (harsh labor) —as found in Exodus 1:13, where it describes the physical labor inflicted upon the Jews in Egypt. The use of this phrase is evidence that Vitlin saw a parallel between the plight of the black slaves and the slavery of the Children of Israel in Egypt and used it to evoke sympathy among his readers for the plight of contemporary slaves.74 He sums up his attitude: tx rx ox! tonaix v'x ixs oxn ira1? -pa rx isoors nx -pa rx -wa...x,n 'ix .■psaix xitx unna snsrn era r^xr iswtnsa Oy vey, bitter and dark is my life that there can be such an injustice, that people should treat so their brothers.75 69.

Rauch too omits the hero's involvement with the black slave trade. As Idelson-Shein notes, the opposition to the slave trade or to slavery in these works is not a necessary result of the writers' Jewish backgrounds.78 Yet at the same time, their reactions to slavery do not arise only from their contacts with European thought and literature. Although the maskilic observations on slavery discussed so far are all to be found in reworkings of Campe's books, since these texts are free adaptations and by no means close translations, the pres ence of these discussions indicates that the adaptors actively chose to include them. Reinforcing this conclusion is the authors' decision to include additional information, descriptions, and discussion of the topic; and their use of the shibuz to describe black slavery and identify the plight of the slaves with that of the Children of Israel in Egypt. Some of the writers also go further than Campe in their critiques of slavery. In fact, a complex set of factors motivated these mas kilic writers to discuss the topic of black slavery: their desire to educate and morally edify, to praise the enlightened values of abolitionists, and to instill in readers respect for European society. However, most of these writers, while oppos ing the trade in slaves as inhuman, were resigned to the use of slaves on plantations in the New World and were well aware of the advantages of this system.

Vertical legitimization is achieved by invoking biblical/historical precedents; by Judaization techniques; and/or by an authorial, thematic presentation similar to that of Jewish ethical lit erature."82 For the most part, Dik's works are concerned with problems and issues within Jewish society—for example, calls for productivity or warnings against arranged marriages, sectarianism, and superstition—and with imparting moral messages to his readers on these and other topics. In some works Dik also provides his readers with general edification on topics as varied as history, geography, wildlife, natural phenomena, anthropology, politics, and more, as the above quotation demonstrates. Within Dik's bibliography sea adventures form a homogenous group.83 In these works, the sea serves not only as the backdrop to adventure or as a plot device, taking characters far away from their places of origin and separating them from familiar surroundings and society; as a platform for substantial intro ductions or digressions, it is also used to accomplish unmistakable moral and general educational aims. In all the sea tales Jewish themes and perspectives feature prominently—at times they are integral to the original stdry (for example, in Dik's translation of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura's sea voyage to the land of Israel in Der Bartenure)4 and at times a result of heavy Judaization by the author (as in Ma'oz ha-yam, 'Iyei ha-yam, Der apekun, and others). Furthermore, in all his works where the sea plays an educational role as well as one important work with no connection to the sea—his translation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom s Cabin or Negro Life in the Slave States of America as Di shklaveray oder di laybeygnshaft (Slavery),85—Dik addresses Frieden.

On the basis of Dik's use of this prooftext it could be argued that Ma'oz ha-yam is a continuation of the polemic that raged between the two groups through the medium of sea literature. 81.

For Dik, the topic was clearly bound up with the sea, because he digresses to discuss slavery in relation to sea travel even when his nar rative bears no connection to black slavery. Dik first addresses black slavery a year into his writing career in 1856, nine years before the abolition of slavery in the United States, and he returns repeatedly to the topic even after abolition achieved success in 1865. His approach to black slavery clearly develops as he moves from condemnations of the slave trade in his earlier work to outright abolitionism in his later texts. Dik's choice of subject matter may be explained by both the traditional stance of the maskilim against the slave trade and the moral lessons he wished to impart to his readers using this material. An analysis of his works demonstrates that one source he used for composing his narratives of sea travel was Campe's work, possibly through Hebrew or Yiddish translations.86 Campe's work, along with the writings of other maskilim, may have influenced Dik's views on the slave trade. Also affecting him was the political climate of Russia during the second half of the nineteenth century. As David Hecht notes, almost "all outstand ing Russian progressive intellectuals were united in condemning the system of American Negro slavery. They sensed keenly the connection between serfdom at home... and the system of American Negro servitude. They hated both."87 In the repressive years under Nicholas I, Russian intellectuals could voice criticism of American slavery but not of serfdom in Russia. Even after Alexander II ascended the throne in 1855 and political repression lessened, these intellectuals continued to support the abolition of black slavery and accordingly sided with the Northern states in the Civil War.*8 Interest in the issue of slavery, both at home and abroad, was reflected in the success of Uncle Tom's Cabin in Russia (it was published in Russian translation in 1853, one year after its publication in English in Boston); the American book in fact created more of a sensation in Russia than Turgenev's Sportsman's Sketches (1852) or The Inn (1855), which depicted the lives of Russian serfs.89 Dik's wide and varied reading, as demon strated repeatedly by his eclectic sources, are evidence of his exposure to the anti slavery views of the Russian intelligentsia.90 86. Evidence of this is to be found in his descriptions of journeys to the poles in piVel Ha-shem and Das ayngefrorene shif oyf dem ayzmer, which draw upon volume 1 of Sammlung interessanter und durchgangig zweckmafiig abgefafiter Reisebeschreibungen fir die Jugend, and in his descriptions of the history of the conquest of America and Mexico in Amerikaner geshikhte. 87.

Alongside Dik's familiarity with Campe, a wide range of travel literature, novels including Eugene Sue's Les mysteres de Paris, Jewish and non-Jewish folktales, his up-to-date knowledge indi cates that he read newspapers and maintained a constant interest in current affairs, within and outside the Russian Empire. His narratives of the exploration of the poles and the Sahara Desert, for example, 62</page><page sequence="21">From Slavery to Freedom Although Dik does not mention the slavery of the Russian serfs before their emancipation in 1861 by Alexander II, in works published after that date he praises the emperor extensively in this regard. After Alexander II's assassination in 1881 and the pogroms that followed, Dik returns only once to this topic. Despite his many and detailed descriptions of the harsh conditions of black slavery in the New World, Dik touches only rarely on the condition of the Russian serfs before 1861, and then only to note that slavery in America was harsher than Russian serfdom; in Der apekun (The Trustee), for example, he notes that the slave owners in America gave their slaves , ...(o"1? ^srrN) n'sns snvmx isu is ov -inra Vo -ps rims? much harsher labor than our nobles were accustomed to [give]...,91 using terminology evocative of the Israelites' slavery in Egypt. In all his compari sons between the process of abolition in the United States and the freeing of the Russian serfs, Dik paints a favorable picture of the Russian government: in Russia serfdom ended peacefully, without bloodshed, and the government worried about the serfs' future, giving each one a parcel of land; in the United States, on the other hand, slavery was abolished at a terrible cost through a bloody war, and after abolition many slaves were left destitute.92 Dik clearly saw many parallels between the situations in the two countries, but his comparisons always serve to praise Russia.93 In this respect, Dik joins the many Jewish voices praising Alexander II throughout the 1860s. Eli Lederhand ler's comments on political expressions in Hebrew newspapers during the 1860s are relevant here to Dik's Yiddish works: When the Hebrew Hamelitz responded to anti-Jewish claims with apologetics and refutations, the editor's righteous indignation or sermonic references to demonstrate his familiarity with the latest developments in exploration and colonialism. He also dis plays current knowledge of the British imperial expansion in several works. For a fuller discussion of the influences on Dik, see Roskies, "Annotated Bibliography"; and Roskies, Ayzik-Meyer Dik and the Rise of Yiddish Popular Literature (PhD diss., Brandeis University, 1975). 91. Isaac Meir Dik, Der apekun (Vilna, 1872), 6. A similar comment also appears in Isaac Meir Dik, Amerikaner geshikhte (Vilna 1899), 15. 92. Similar sentiments appear in his praise of the tsar's emancipation of the serfs in Ha-carmel (Vilna, 1861, e.g., 259) alongside portraits of the bloody war raging in America. 93. As Roger Dow notes in his comparison of the antebellum South and prereform Russia, the two were in fact very similar: Legally there was indeed a vast difference between serfdom and slavery, but in practice the points stressed were of no great importance.... In America the laws were harsh, but common-sense and ordinary humanity had so modified them that, practically, they did not differ from those in Russia. American law regarding slavery pretty generally rested on the maxim: "A slave has no rights that a white man is bound to respect," whereas a Russian jurist summarized the Russian situation as follows: "The serf has no property rights which can be effectively defended against his master." The phrasing is different, but the results were the same. (Dow, "Seichas: A Comparison of Pre-Reform Russia and the Ante-Bellum South," 3-15.) 63</page><page sequence="22">Rebecca Wolpe civic virtue and patriotism contained a hidden agenda: The maskilic claim for full-participant status in Russian society was being advanced in Hebrew in order to convince the Jewish reader, not the Russian.94 Maskilic authors writing in Yiddish and Hebrew did not praise the tsar to garner favor with the Russian authorities or the Russian intelligentsia. Written in the languages most familiar to a Jewish public, these texts were specifically directed at Jewish readers: the Hebrew newspaper Ha-magid, for example, recognized as its own purpose the rousing of Jews to good and useful social purpose. So too, through many of these texts, maskilic writers sought to instill feelings of patriotism to the Russian Empire and love and respect for its leader.95 The aim of these works was to convince Jewish readers of the desirability of gaining wider education and improving themselves so that they would be granted full rights and entrance into Russian society. While not directly requesting that the tsarist government integrate Jews fully into Russian society, these writers encour aged their readers to begin transforming themselves in order to achieve this goal. Dik's comparisons between Russia and America may also hint at his under standing of where the future of the Jewish people lay. In an article titled "America in the Works of I. M. Dik," Shmuel Niger asserts that Dik counseled Jews to emi grate to the United States and that following the pogroms of the 1880s he sided with the 'Am 'Olam group, which favored emigration to the United States over emigration to Palestine. As examples Niger cites Di yidn in lite (1871), in which a Lithuanian Jew becomes a pious and successful plantation owner in Louisiana, and Der unbegetener gast (also 1871), in whose introduction Dik calls America the God-given solution to the problem of continuing population expansion in Europe; at some point the European population would become too great for mainland Europe to contain.96 Although Dik certainly saw the possibilities for Jewish life in America, his comments on America's treatment of slaves and on the corrupting effects that American life had on Jewish settlers indicate that he was not as enamored with the United States as Niger suggests. Dik understood the negative consequences of relocation to America, including the detrimental influence of luxury, the lust for wealth, and isolation, and many of these perceptions come to fore in his dis cussions of black slavery. In Der apekun and Amerikaner geshikhte oder keyn soyne zol dir tsu kleyn zayn (An American Story, or Don't Underestimate Your Enemy),97 Dik demonstrates how slave ownership can corrupt Jewish immigrants. Although he may have sided with 'Am 'Olam following the events of 1881, before 94. Eli Lederhendler, Modern Jewish Politics, 126-28. For purposes of public relations with non-Jews the short-lived Russian newspaper Raszvet (1860-61) and later Zederbaum's Vestnik russikh evreev (1871-73) and Odessa Den (1869-71) were created. 95.

Isaac Meir Dik, Amerikaner geshikhte (Vilna 1899). 64</page><page sequence="23">From Slavery to Freedom this, during the reign of Alexander II, Dik appeared to be a firm believer that Jews should aspire to integrate into Russian society rather than leave for the New World.98 Dik's first comments on black slavery appear in 'Iyei ha-vam (The Islands of the Sea).99 To appeal to a traditional readership, Dik uses both Judaization and bib lical allusion and imagery, which are found in the title of the work itself: 'Iyei ha-yam is a fragment of the biblical verse Esther 10:1. His hero/narrator is a Jewish doctor who joins an English battleship bound for Asia. Slavery is certainly not a central theme of 'Iyei ha-yam; rather Dik digresses from his description of sharks to a discussion of slavery.100 Dik notes that sharks follow ships in the hope of a meal of human flesh, gathering especially around ships that are stranded or carrying sick people. Many more sharks follow the slave ships transporting black people bought by "our Europeans" to become their slaves in America, since so many die during the voyage and their corpses are thrown overboard. Those who arrive in America alive will be worked like cattle. Despite his criticism of the "Europeans" and their actions, in his discussion of slavery in 'Iyei ha-yam Dik also makes an uncharacteristically harsh comment about the black Africans, noting that mothers sell their children for needles, beads, and other baubles, thinking that they have taken advantage of the Europeans. In none of his other works dealing with slavery does Dik repeat this statement or any thing similar to it. Dik describes the harsh conditions of the Atlantic crossing, with slaves packed into ships like herring. Due to these conditions, he notes, many die in transit; and the slave dealers are happy if a third of their merchandise arrives alive. He then goes on to bless the French, Russian, and English governments who "these days" are sending warships to patrol the seas, capture slave ships, and put an end to this terrible trade.101 Dik reiterates the same information about slave trading in Ma 'oz ha-yam}02 This time his hero and narrator, a young British Jewish sailor, spends two years as a castaway on an island as punishment for an unspecified misdeed aboard ship.103 Again Dik's digression on slavery has no connection with the narrative account, 98. In the latter part of his career Dik published fewer travel accounts and sea adventures, a choice that may be attributed to changes not only in ideology but also in the literary milieu. Dik was threatened by the sensational romances written by Shomer (Nahum Meyer Shaikevitz, who began publishing in 1876), as is clear from his critique of these "new" novels in Dos ayngefrorene shif oyf dem ayzmer (The Frozen Ship on the Ice Sea) (Vilna, 1882). 99. Isaac Meir Dik, 'Iyei ha-yam (Vilna, 1856). 100. Ibid., 11-12. 101. The African Squadron or Anti-Slavery Squadron was established by Britain in 1808 in response to pressure from abolitionists. Other countries signed treaties to cooperate with Britain in putting an end to the slave trade, but in reality most captures of slave ships were by the British. Esti mates put the success rate between 1811 and 1867 at one in five slave ships. For further information, see David Eltis, Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). 102. Dik, Ma'oz ha-yam, 28. 103. Dik's heroes are often enlightened, western Jews, who during the course of his stories demonstrate how they successfully combine in perfect harmony traditional piety with their enlightened 65</page><page sequence="24">Rebecca Wolpe which is to all intents and purposes a Robinsonade. Once again, the discussion of slavery appears during a description of sharks, as it did in 'Iyei ha-yam. This time, however, the narrator confesses that he was once on a slave-trading ship with hun dreds of blacks traveling from Africa to be sold as slaves in America. Sharks would accompany the ship day and night hoping to consume the dead slaves thrown into the water. Three or four would die each day, and only one in ten sur vived (a lower survival rate than the one-third in 'Iyei ha-yam). In 1868 Dik published Di vistenay zahara (The Sahara Desert), in which he also addresses the issue of slavery, again as an aside from the main plot, which follows a French Jew on his journey from Senegal to his home in Europe through the Sahara Desert. In 1828 the narrator sails to the African island of St. Louis to claim an inheritance and, in his descriptions of the island, mentions its five thousand European inhabitants and the thirty thousand Negro slaves who work the land.104 He also declares that he would need several books to describe the unfortunate condition of the slaves in every land, especially those who reach America. The slave traders who come to St. Louis to buy black slaves separate families, tearing children from their mothers' breasts and violating all of nature's holy bonds. His descriptions of the terror and trauma that are part and parcel of the slave trade are very different from his earlier comments in 'Iyei ha-yam on the African mothers who sell their own children for baubles. Di vistenay zahara demonstrates a development in Dik's approach toward black slavery as well as his acquaintance with more detailed sources of infor mation. This work was published in the same year as Dik's adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Di shklaveray. Although the descriptions in Di vistenay zahara of the inhuman conditions to which slaves are subjected during the passage across the Atlantic are not based on Uncle Tom's Cabin—which concentrates on the fate of slaves in the American South—and are similar to those in 'Iyei ha-yam and Ma 'oz ha-yam, the influence of Stowe's work on Dik's approach to slavery is evident: from this time onward, his descriptions of slavery are more detailed and highly critical. Uncle Tom's Cabin transformed Dik from an opponent of the slave trade into an abolitionist. Much of the information in Di vistenay zahara about life on plantations and about Jewish and Christian slave owners is similar to that in Uncle Tom's Cabin and Dik's Di shklaveray. Dik describes plantation owners who hit their slaves without mercy and house them in cabins that are worse than dog kennels; although they do give them Sunday as a day to rest, the slaves have to use that day to work their own plots. The slaves owned by Jewish masters, however, are treated far better—they have two days to rest every week, Shabbat and Sunday, and are not hit as hard. The worst punishment for slaves of Jewish owners is the threat of sale to Christians. Dik describes the fate of those who try to run away or rise way of life and involvement in European society. Dik's portrayals of his heroes provide an indication of his ideal "maskil," which he hoped would provide an example to which his readers could aspire. 104. Dik, Di vistenay zahara, 11-15. 66</page><page sequence="25">From Slavery to Freedom up against their masters, including a footnote on a 1795 slave revolt in St. Helena in which slaves killed their masters and families and burned plantations, resulting in a terrible war.105 The narrator notes a decree by the governor of St. Louis that upon selling a plantation the owner had to free ten percent of his slaves, who have ten years to pay back the cost. On selling his inherited plantation, Dik's narrator frees twenty "innocent souls" with their families. He describes the money they owe to him as "blood money," which he shudders to accept. He also states that it is a shame on "cultured France" that such tyranny could take place. Not only is Dik's discussion of slavery more developed and detailed in this later work, but it is also more sharply critical. In a footnote, however, Dik coun terpoints his criticism with praise for the wonderful deeds of Alexander II, who abolished this terrible trade "in all his lands in our time." Dik declares that Alex ander's name will be remembered forever for freeing twenty-five million people with one stroke of his pen. At the same time, he refers to an emancipation in North America that is "smaller" in terms of the number of people liberated, but cost much blood. He concludes with the hope that this disgraceful trade will also cease in Africa. This work, written after the abolition of slavery in the United States and the freeing of the serfs in Russia, and following Dik's work on Uncle Tom s Cabin, has the advantage of hindsight, which explains its sharp criti cism of the institution of slavery in parallel with extensive praise for the tsar who abolished serfdom. Three further works by Dik revolve almost entirely around the issue of black slavery: Di shklaveray, Der apekun, and Amerikaner geshikhte. The first of these, his Judaized adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin, was in Dik's opinion the most accomplished of his works on slavery; hence in Der apekun he refers his readers to Di shklaveray for more information on the subject.106 In fact most of the information on slavery in the introductions to Der apekun and Amerikaner geshikhte is based on Di shklaveray, demonstrating its continuing influence on Dik's approach to slavery. Di shklaveray sets out Dik's total opposition to slavery and his empathy with the suffering of the slaves. The identification of slaves with the Jews and the Exodus narrative, a common motif in the preaching and writing of black slaves themselves, is a theme in Stowe's novel; note, for example, this description of Eliza's escape from the Southern to the Northern states over the frozen Ohio River: the river in front of her is "like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side."107 Dik picks up on the use of this motif and expands upon it in the prayer he places in Eliza's mouth as she faces the frozen river 105. Dik is mistaken as to the year and location of the revolt: what he describes here is actually the Saint Domingue rebellion of 1791. 106. Dik's adaptation of Uncle Tom s Cabin is a complete rewriting of the novel, including the Judaization of most of the characters and significant plot alterations. This work will not be discussed here in detail since it cannot be classified as a work of sea literature, but will be referred to only with regard to its influence on Dik's abolitionist ideology. 107. Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin (London: John Cassel, 1852), 44. 67</page><page sequence="26">Rebecca Wolpe with her young son in her arms: she likens herself to Ruth, the foreigner who became a believer and went to live among Jews, and was rewarded for her piety by becoming the ancestor of King David: "O Great Creator, cause me to pass through these terrible troubles as once you caused Your people Israel to pass through the Reed Sea, because I believe in You as they did; I am a poor Ruth from another people who has come to shelter under the shadow of Your wings.. .."108 Dik uses biblical imagery and prooftexts throughout this work, refer ring to Psalms, to the sayings of the sages, and to midrashim. In a speech given by Tom to his fellow slaves as Haley is taking him away, Tom urges the others to remain calm and have patience, as God will take revenge on the white tyrants, to the third and fourth generations, quoting Exodus 20:4.109 In a footnote, Dik informs his readers that Tom's words were "prophetic," since they were realized during the Civil War. Likewise, he justifies helping runaway slaves with the bib lical commandment not to hand over a runaway slave to his master, Deuteronomy 23:16-17.110 Der apekun and Amerikaner geshikhte are classified by Roskies as "sensational-exotic romances."111 They involve far-fetched plots, forbidden love, romantic trysts, and greed against the backdrop of plantations on the Amer ican continent; and they offer strong moral messages on equality, brotherhood, love of one's neighbor, piety, and simple living as well as educational content on slavery, American history, geography, nature, and more. Both books tell stories of European Jews who have migrated to the New World (in Der apekun, to antebellum Louisiana; and in Amerikaner geshikhte, to Guadeloupe) and how they cope with life so distant from their European home land. In both works, Dik reiterates much of the information he provides elsewhere on slavery: its origins, the passage of slaves over the ocean, and their treatment in America; however, he also deals extensively with the issue of Jews as slave owners and the potentially morally debilitating effects of slave ownership on a person's character. Although Dik claims (in Di shklaveray and Di vistenay zahara) that Jewish slave owners are kinder to their slaves than Christians, in Der apekun and Amer ikaner geshikhte he demonstrates that this was not always the case and that Jewish slave owners could be tyrannical and inhumane. In Der apekun, his antihero, Markus Optzom, is likened to the devil. He forces his slaves to carry out harsh labor and dangerous tasks, sending the younger slaves into dark, thick forests during the night to catch beautiful birds—a task from which many do not return, because they get lost in the forest or are bitten by poisonous snakes."2 Dik suggests that the slave revolt at the close of the story, in which Markus and his family are murdered, is God's punishment for his many sins. 108.

Dik, Der apekun, 47-48. 68</page><page sequence="27">From Slavery to Freedom Dik's description of slaves who escape their masters and band together in forests is at once idyllic and critical: he does not condone their violent attacks on slave owners, but he supports them in their decision to flee their masters.113 This is true also of his description of the slave revolt on the island of St. Domingue (Haiti) in Di vistenay zahara, which he concludes by praising the free republic established by the former slaves.114 Der apekun concludes with the abolition of slavery, in which Dik's hero is instrumental:"5 (psVxrra) viinon V&gt;d -isr,,i a"* -isn tra ran ocmr nsroius ran tran istr sth nsn ran ty .orarm wyrrain «h |&gt;x ^ran awn rraVpw y"?x pd jiRcnssa xn is rx:xnx ra'x d'zd iw ran -is ]V7 .is nsn 'rsv tdiis era mix rx wxn -isbo-is; □is ovn is; iw oral o:xn ivt cran )»»X3 rt nx .fBx'rpw srn D'nssa isnns .pcra This Yosef was a great judge and in time contributed much to the liberation of all the slaves in the Southern states. He was the first to give a good example of this, for twenty years earlier he freed his slaves. And his name is remembered with honor to this day. Thus despite his claims that Jews can be humane slave owners, usually more humane than Christians, Dik's ideal remains abolition, and he even allocates a role in this process to his Jewish heroes. Der apekun and Amerikaner geshikhte, as well as Di shklaveray, were pub lished after the abolition of slavery in both the United States and the Russian Empire. Why would Dik produce abolitionist texts after abolition had already been achieved? The answer to this question lies perhaps in the maskil's self perception as a musar preacher and social reformer who attempts to arouse in his readers the desire to integrate into Russian society. Dik uses the institution of slavery to emphasize the ethical qualities that maskilim had been championing since the beginning of the Haskalah as necessary for entrance into European society, including brotherhood, tolerance, equality, patience, and modesty; he conveys these ethical qualities through his descriptions of the corrupting effects of slave ownership and slave trading. In a similar vein, through his criticisms of black slavery, his descriptions of slave traders and owners, and his comparisons of the situations in America and Russia (to the advantage of the latter), he seeks to inspire readers both to reform themselves so that they can become a part of Russian society and to respect and honor the tsar as an example of enlightenment and humanity. All but one of the works dis cussed herein were written before 1881; and Dik returned only once after this to the detrimental effects of immigration to the New World and slave ownership— in a work that was published only posthumously (and indeed perhaps Dik had decided not to publish this work). The fact that after 1881 he abandoned these 113. Dik, Der apekun, 61. 114. Dik, Di vistenay zahara, 12-13. 115. Dik, Der apekun, 63. 69</page><page sequence="28">Rebecca Wolpe subjects may indicate a change in his ideology as well as in where he saw the future of the Jewish people. Conclusion A survey of maskilic sea literature demonstrates that from the beginning of the nineteenth century maskilic writers were interested in the issue of black slavery and wanted to educate their readers on this topic. In adaptations of sea literature that often omitted much of the material from the source text, these writers chose to include descriptions of and comments on black slavery. Most of these writers express horror at the slave trade, but many seem resigned to the existence of black slavery in the New World, acknowledging its economic benefits. Comments by early maskilic writers such as Mendelsohn, Hurwitz and Guenzburg provided a precedent that was taken up by Isaac Meir Dik in his works of original fiction. He chose to discuss the issue of black slavery in connec tion with sea voyages, even where there was no clear connection between the issue and his narrative. His earlier succinct and critical descriptions of the slave trade developed in his later writings into lengthy portraits and censure of the institution of black slavery. A complex web of factors led maskilic writers to discourse on the topic of black slavery. Among these were sympathy for the slaves, a desire to emulate European writers, the desire to educate and bring moral edification, and the goal of arousing in readers the desire to integrate into enlightened European society. Further research of texts outside the corpus discussed herein (for example, newspapers, other travel accounts, and textbooks) will widen the under standing of this phenomenon and unveil previously neglected aspects of maskilic thought.
