Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2007. xviii, 438 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001268 The present volume constitutes the most involved effort to date aimed at comparing the intricacies of Qumranic sectarianism with separatist groups from early modern Europe. As the author recognizes, the endeavor owes a great deal to the work of Albert I. Baumgarten, who compared Jewish sectarianism in the late Second Temple period with the flourishing of Protestant sects in Puritan England.1 Yet Regev's book differs from its progenitor in a number of ways. Baumgarten sought to shed light on sectarianism broadly conceived, and therefore his analysis included many Protestant groups and all the groups of the late Second Temple period, including the aristocratic Sadducees. Regev, however, is interested primarily in the striking?and sometimes very specific?comparisons that can be drawn between the most separatist of ancient Jewish groups (the Qumran sectar ians) and a certain subset of the Protestant ones, including the Anabaptists, Men nonites, Hutterites, Amish, Puritans, Quakers, and Shakers. In drawing this comparison, Regev begins with Bryan Wilson's definition of "introversionist" sects: groups that, in Regev's words, see "the world as alien and irredeemably evil, and from which individuals must withdraw as fully as possible in order to attain salvation" (43). Following this definition, the remainder of Regev's lengthy first chapter presents an initial comparison of the role played by atonement and revelation for these introversionist sects (43-93). The promised, sustained comparison of these groups is then delayed until the last four of the book's eleven chapters. In the run-up to this, Regev embarks on an extended textual analysis of Qumranic and related Second Temple literature. After analyzing the themes of defilement and holiness, especially as manifest in the Temple Scroll and MMT (Chaps. 2 and 3), Regev turns to the social structures evident primarily in the Rule of the Community and the Damascus Document (Chap. 4). Working out from Qumranic literature, Regev then turns to 1 Enoch (Chap. 5), Jubilees (Chap. 6), and the classical descriptions of the Essenes (Chap. 7). While these chapters are occasion ally peppered with comparative or theoretical observations, the bulk of them is devoted to Regev's own reconstruction of the literary history of the Qumran sect.

These middle chapters do have their distinctive features, perhaps most notably in Regev's important and provocative assertion (261-66) that the Essenes may have developed out of the Qumranic group, and not, as commonly asserted, the other way around. This is an important possibility for scholars to consider. While Chapters 2 through 7 are not without interest, most readers will gravitate toward the sections highlighted by the book's title: the cross-cultural comparison between Qumran and the modern European sects. It is in this section of the book that we are presented with analyses of sectarian approaches to social structure (Chap. 8), gender (Chap. 9), wealth (Chap. 10), and mysticism (Chap. 11). In each of these chapters, the author presents evidence in favor of his proposed comparison, and to his credit, differences, too, are also pointed out. So, for example, groups such as the Shakers, Amish, and Hutterites?just like the Qumran sectarians?admitted new comers only after prolonged processes of examination and acclimation (Chap. 8). With regard to gender (Chap. 9), Regev stands with those who assert that the Qum ranic group (like the majority of the later Protestant sects) was not celibate, while the Essenes (like the later Shakers) were. But many of these groups, Qumran included, exhibit particular interest in limiting sexuality, on the one hand, and providing outlets for women leaders, on the other. Regev's conclusion is that these and other similarities extend not from parallel or shared historical influences but from the sociological phenomenon of introversionist sectarianism (298, 383-86). Regev's efforts at engaging the anthropological and sociological literature are both impressive and frustrating. What is impressive is the breadth of his curi osity, as evidenced by the book's use of a great many classic theoretical works. Moreover, the analysis is supported by extensive data on the early modern intro versionist sects. What is frustrating is Regev's holistic approach to this material: It is as if sociology and anthropology have produced an essentially harmonious amalgam of approaches, such that it is perfectly safe to take a little of this (Wilson's definition of introversionist sects in Chap. 1) and a little of that (Mary Douglas's grid and group in Chap. 3), as long as it yields a comparison. Regev's use of comparative data is similarly unsystematic, for he feels free to compare Qumran to nonintroversionist sects when it suits his needs. When dealing with ritual contagion or moral defilement?aspects of Qumranic religios ity not amenable to comparison with Protestant religious groups?Regev reaches back to the ancient Greek concept of miasma (115-16) and out to African and Polynesian notions of taboo (154-57). Just as he is not bothered by adopting varying sociological or anthropological approaches, Regev does not reckon with the possibility that identifying important similarities between Qumran and nonsectarian?let alone nonintroversionist?groups could raise questions in readers' minds as to the solidity of his thesis. For all this work's engagement with the theoretical literature, what is missing here is sufficient critical reflection on the science?or art?of comparison itself. This problem can be felt most keenly when we consider the book's structural tension: A static, synchronie comparison of ancient Jewish and early modern 408</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Protestant introversionist sects (Chaps. 1, 8-11) bookends an extended, diachronic textual analysis of the Qumran sect (Chaps. 2-7). We are not given any account of the religious and social context out of which the Protestant sects emerged. Yet trends that were rather widespread in the late medieval and early modern European milieu are identified by Regev as particular characteristics of introversionist sects. What Regev regards as the introversionist approach to atonement (characterized, for instance, by self-guilt; 73-80) could come straight out of John Calvin (no sectarian he). Similarly, what Regev sees as the introversionist approach to revelation (that rev elation can justify new religious movements; 81-93) is also surely a much broader phenomenon. Again, what Regev considers the introversionist approach to wealth can easily be traced?for Christians?back to Acts 2:43^17. Finally, the gradual admission of newcomers, restrictive attitudes toward sex, and even mystical experi ences were all typical qualities of medieval Christian monasticism, which is discussed only briefly (27,279 n. 39). Throughout the first two-thirds of this book, Regev con fidently and thoroughly reconstructs the literary history of the Qumran sectarians and Essenes. It is surprising, and problematic for his thesis, that he exhibits so little interest in the context and development of the groups at the other end of his cross-cultural comparison. This imbalance is problematic because, clearly, the two sets of groups exhibit some important differences: There are, of course, the cultic issues (ritual defilement and the like) that matter a great deal at Qumran but matter very little to the early modern Protestants. The two sets of groups also exhibit similarities?such as predeterminism?that are, certainly in the early modern context, hardly restricted to sectarian groups. To his credit, Regev directly addresses some of these questions early in the work (26-29). But the fact that his book juxtaposes a rich history on one side (Qumran) with a rather decontex tualized abstraction on the other detracts from the fullness of his answers, and I, for one, am still left wondering whether at least some, if not many, of the simi larities Regev keenly observes extend not from the inherent qualities of introver sionist sectarianism but from other shared factors in the religious and cultural environments in which these sets of groups emerged. Still, what we are given here is impressive nonetheless: a detailed comparison of two sets of groups that exhibit a fascinating set of similarities. And to top it all off, there are numerous important insights and corrections offered in each chapter along the way, culminat ing in a poignant call for greater sympathy when treating sectarian groups (386-87). Thoroughly explaining the many similarities and some differences that Regev has identified will be the task of those who choose to make productive use of this creative and ambitious work.
