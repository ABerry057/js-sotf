<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steven T. Katz. Post Holocaust Dialogues: Critical Studies in Modern Jewish Thought. New York: New York University Press, 1983. 327 pp.&amp; This book is a collection of nine essays, five published before in various journals and four appearing here for the first time. The essays are critical in the sense of surveying the work of an author and subjecting it to evaluative analysis. The authors treated are Martin Buber, Eliezer Berkovits, Richard Rubenstein, Emil Fackenheim, and Ignaz Maybaum. Most of the authors are discussed more than once, since one of the articles, "Jewish Faith After the Holocaust: Four Approaches," deals with four writers to whom separate articles are also devoted. Only the late essay, "The 'Unique' Intentionality of the Holocaust," deals with a problem rather than an author. The unity of the book is therefore not a natural one, since the essays were written for discreet occasions and deal with a variety of issues. There are three basic topics in the book. The first is a critical appraisal of Buber's I-Thou philosophy, and the second, an evaluation of Buber's treat- ment of Hasidism. Only the third concerns the Holocaust, raising some questions about the appropriateness of the title. Here the views of Berkovits, Rubenstein, Fackenheim, and Maybaum are examined and found wanting in varying degrees, though Berkovits's position emerges the least scathed. Katz's philosophic style is analytic in the current philosophic sense of the term. Frequently, authors are criticized for lack of clarity and for not speci- fying what they would accept as counterevidence to the position they are advocating. The verifiability criterion of meaning is never far from the surface. But it can be asked how useful it is to apply this particular yardstick to writers who do not subscribe to it. In any case, a certain degree of dissonance is to be expected when the orientations of the critic and his</page><page sequence="2">122 BOOK REVIEWS subject do not coincide. While such dissonance is not absent from these essays, Katz does not apply his analytic and empiricist criteria so dog- matically as to make himself irrelevant. He works hard at respecting the framework of those he writes about. Katz is very properly aware that there is too much history of Jewish thought in current Jewish scholarship and too little Jewish thought. He affirms that "the studies in this volume are not essentially expository or historical. They are not primarily interested in questions of historical causality and influence or mere textual clarification, though this is done as required. Rather their pre-eminent concern is whether and in what sense, certain well worked claims in the corpus of modern Jewish thought can be said to be true" (p. xii). This interest can only be applauded. Just as there would be no art historians if there were no painters and sculptors, so there would be no scholars of Jewish history if there were no Jewish poets, legalists, and philosophers. And these poets, legalists, and philosophers must produce original works and not just retell what others have done before them. In the light of this commitment, I find it curious that Katz comes down so strongly on the anti-Buber side of the Buber-Scholem controversy on Hasidism. The details of the controversy need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that two key elements in the controversy concern Buber's ignoring of the importance of the kabbalistic, or "theoretical," writings of Hasidism and his almost total emphasis on the tales and his recasting of the tales so as to maximize their existential, concrete, and this-worldly tone. Katz docu- ments Buber's editorial impact on the tales and concludes "that the class of theoretical material should receive priority, though in a dialectical manner, over the legendary sources in trying to arrive at an accurate image of Hasidism" (p. 73). Were Buber to be read strictly as a historical scholar, Scholem's and Katz's criticism might be on target. But suppose Buber is seen as someone whose goal was to present Hasidism so that it could become a religious reality to his Western European readers. Here, looking backward in the manner of the historian is not the only issue but also a looking forward, so that the spirit of Hasidism can live once again. In a sense, this is a seeking for the truth of Hasidism in just the sense in which Katz wishes to raise the question of truth instead of practicing the craft of history. After all, there is more than one way of raising the question of truth. One can ask whether this or that view is "true," as Katz does. Or one can reshape a tradition in accordance with its inner direction and the demands of the situation in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 123 which the interpreter finds himself. To do so is far more dangerous than to practice "objective" historical scholarship and certain to attract the derision of the objectivist. The strange part is that such an accomplishment may, in the long run, even be better history. To arrive at the inner truth of some spiritual realities it may be advisable to look away from what they are to what they are trying to be. Particularly with religious matters, precious metal is often mixed with dross, and the eye that can distinguish the two sees more than one that sees everything as being of equal value. With respect to the tales versus the "theoretical" writings of Hasidism, I cannot avoid a comparison with the state of affairs in Communist countries. Suppose someone who wished to grasp the essence of the Soviet system, instead of visiting the Soviet Union, devoted himself to reading the works of Marx and Engels. These writings are, indeed, the "theoretical" works behind the Soviet system. But, in fact, they have very little relationship to the reality of that system. To grasp that reality, reading the works of Marx and Engels may be the worst possible route. And this remains so, even if we were to assume that the Soviet leadership "believes" what they read in the "theoretical" works of Marxism. Sometimes reality has little connection with the "theoretical" writings on which a system is supposedly based. Could it be that there is some parallel here to the Hasidic situation? Kabbalah was the theoretical literature of the movement. It was honored, studied, and believed. But the genius of Hasidism was not to be found in these theoretical writings but in the life of the community and the relation- ship of the Zaddik to his followers, all of which was captured not in the theoretical writings but in the tales that reflected the life of the community, or at least how the religious memory of the community remembered that life. If even these tales had to be somewhat purified, the purification merely brought out their inner truth, the direction in which they pointed, the form in which they could serve the religious needs of the Jewish people in the twentieth century, in Western Europe. Such an interpretative redrawing of the contours of Hasidism need not have brought out the objective historian in Katz, especially since he defines his own task philosophically and not purely historically. It is true that Buber does not make all this clear, that he can be accused of giving the impression that he is practicing "objective" history when he is not. Still, even if Buber should have made more clear what he was and was not doing, it did not take great hermeneutical sophisti- cation to discover what, in fact, he was doing. The footnote never was Buber's favorite literary genre. With respect to Katz's treatment of Buber's basic I-Thou philosophy, it</page><page sequence="4">124 BOOK REVIEWS is his claim that Buber was a Kantian that most attracts the reader's atten- tion. Katz identifies Buber's I-It domain with Kant's phenomena. Both the I-It and phenomena are defined by time and space, causality, objectivity, expressibility in language and being subject to the rules of logic. The I-Thou and the noumenal realm have in common that the just-mentioned charac- teristics of the I-It/phenomenal domain do not apply to them. Kant locates freedom in the noumenal realm, to which one relates, according to Kant, by means of "'intuitive' apprehension" (p. 10), which is also the mode of apprehending the Thou. Having diagnosed Buber's Kantianism, Katz criti- cizes both Kant and Buber for idealistic subjectivism. In its place, Katz prescribes "a more sober philosophical 'realism"' which does not assign to the observing subject a major constitutive role in the shaping of reality. How convincing is Katz's claim that Buber was a Kantian? There are some similarities between the I-It realm and phenomena, and between the I-Thou domain and noumena, and Katz does an admirable job in pointing these out. But there are also significant dissimilarities about which Katz is silent. The dissimilarities are probably more important than the similarities. Kant addresses himself to an epistemic problem: why is it that synthetic a priori knowledge is possible? Even the ethical realm is seen in epistemic terms: given the fact that we have moral knowledge, what must be the rela- tionship between the human subject and the sensory world that makes a priori moral knowledge possible? Buber, on the other hand, is not an episte- mic thinker. The distinction between the I-Thou and the I-It relationships is a distinction not in the domain of knowledge but in that of being. The I-Thou relationship is not a knowing by a subject of a Thou who is an object. It is not a reflection in one consciousness of the reality of another consciousness. The I-Thou, when genuine, occurs between the I and the Thou, and the participants find themselves released from their subjectivities. It is only when each subjectivity steps out of itself that genuine meeting occurs; locked into the knowledge of subjects, no meeting is possible. Though Buber does not use the terminology of ontology, he is an ontologi- cal thinker (though not in Heidegger's sense) to the extent that knowledge as contained in consciousness is not his concern but the relational being of persons, which is by no means exhausted in the act of knowing. It is for this reason that the very title of Katz's essay, "Martin Buber's Epistemology," is problematic. It may be Katz's conviction that everyone has an epistemology which careful analysis will uncover. But every episte-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 125 mology presupposes an ontology, an understanding of the various modes of being, particularly the relation between the being of consciousness and of things. If that is so, then our understanding of knowing rests on our under- standing of being, which is itself not primarily an act of knowing but of being. The very charge of subjectivism may depend on a particular view of the relationship between the being of things and their "reflection" in consciousness that is not congenial to Buber. It is true, of course, that Buber does not work out the ontology best suited for his view of things. But that does not entitle us to judge him as a purely epistemic thinker. With respect to the Holocaust, Katz agrees that "Judaism cannot live if its primary reason for being is the negation of Hitler's ambitions" (p. 224), and he argues that Fackenheim's 614th commandments (Do not give Hitler a posthumous victory) was not meant to push God out of the center of Judaism and to replace Him with the determination not to give Hitler a posthumous victory. Now Katz is fully aware that, for Fackenheim, the Holocaust has erased the secular-religious dichotomy among Jews by making them all subject to the 614th commandment. But how is this possi- ble if God and not the 614th commandment remains at the center of Judaism? It would seem that the unity of secular and religious Jews can only be achieved on a non-God-centered platform, such as the 614th command- ment, which might appeal to the secular because it is self-justifying, rooted in justified hatred of Hitler rather than the love of God. Katz seems most attracted to Berkovits's relatively "conservative and traditional position" (p. 283) on the Holocaust. He is impressed by Berko- vits's claim that the survival of the Jewish people is "the most impressive proof that God is active in history despite his 'hiddenness"' (p. 281). "Jewish history," continues Katz, "defies all theories, usually being the 'exception' that cracks open all generalizations put forward in historical laws. This much I feel able to say with philosophical probity. To say more than this is to speak in the language of faith which even if one shares it, or rather, precisely because one shares it, one can only witness to and not argue about. I see no way of convincing anyone that Israel is God's people, or that, as Judah Halevi described it over a thousand years ago, Israel is the 'heart' of tnle nations. Thus, while I, like Berkovits, find Israel's very survival the strongest evidence both of its transhistorical vocation and the existence of Divine Providence, this affirmation once offered cannot be demonstrat- ed" (pp. 281-282). The line between "witnessing" to faith and "arguing"</page><page sequence="6">126 BOOK REVIEWS about it is probably less sharply drawn than Katz thinks. There is hardly a page in this book on which one cannot find both, which is what happens when a Jewish philosopher like Steven Katz thinks about his faith.
