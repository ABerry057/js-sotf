<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeffrey Veidlinger. The Moscow State Yiddish Theater. Jewish Culture on the So- viet Stage. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. ix, 356 pp. The October Revolution fostered the rise to prominence of two of the great- est Jewish art theatres of the twentieth century: the Hebrew-language Habima and the Yiddish-language Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the latter commonly referred to by its Russian acronym, Goset. The impetus for their creation predated the Rev- olution, with roots, respectively, in Bialystok and Petrograd; but it was only after they established themselves in Moscow that they spread their wings and attained artistic heights that would ensure a place in the annals of world theatre. Both were important participants in the great flowering of the Russian stage during the 1920s, a period that seethed with revolutionary fervor, as Moscow took the vanguard as the incubator for theatrical experimentation. It was here that the theories and artis- tic silhouette of the modern stage were examined, reshaped, and reinvented with an unwavering conviction that theatre matters, that it has the power to transform society. Goset and Habima immersed themselves in the vibrant theatrical culture cre- ated by such theatrical greats as Konstantin Stanislavsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Aleksandr Tairov, and Yevgeny Vakhtangov, directors whose teachings still nurture the world's theater. Eventually, the two companies, benefiting from the state's of- ficial recognition and support (as problematic as it may have been), refashioned the Jewish stage with such avant-garde productions as Habima's The Dybbuk (1922) and Goset's The Sorceress (1922), 200,000 (1923), and A Night in the Old Market (1925). Though Habima and Goset represented two antagonistic political camps- Zionism and Communism-both were children of the revolutionary quest for modernistic Jewish artistic expression. Their stories, however, unfolded along dis- parate paths. Habima left Moscow in 1926, settled permanently in Palestine, and became Israel's national theatre. Goset remained, maneuvering its way through the gauntlet of Soviet political and artistic policies, only to be brutally liquidated by Stalin's henchmen. Solomon Mikhoels, the company's director and star actor, was murdered in an "accident" in Minsk on January 12, 1948, and the company was disbanded the next year; Benjamin Zuskin, his longtime acting partner, was tried on trumped-up charges and executed on August 12, 1952, together with other lead- ing Russian Jewish artists and intellectuals. 351</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Since the 1920s, Goset has captured the attention of Yiddishists, historians, and theatre scholars, who have over time generated a rich literature in Russian, Yid- dish, French, German, and Hebrew, with books that vary in tone and purpose. Jef- frey Veidlinger has made an important contribution to this predominantly non-English body of literature. His carefully researched volume is the first En- glish-language monograph on Goset and the first comprehensive account of the theatre's history from its early beginnings to its liquidation. Exploring his topic in the aftermath of the collapse of the USSR, the author profited from newly released original materials. Though not sensational in their revelations, these documents, ably used by the author, contribute to a deeper and more detailed understanding of the relationship between the state and Goset in their exposition of the minutiae of backstage politics and intrigues. Veidlinger's historical narrative consists of seven chronologically arranged chapters, strung together along the central theme of the Goset's shifting relation- ship with the regime. The first chapter is devoted to the early days, with an em- phasis on its ur-history as the Jewish Theatrical Society established in Petrograd in 1916. This prerevolutionary phase is a near-forgotten period that the author highlights in order to correct what he considers to be two self-serving accounts of the company's formation, one by Alexander Granovsky, its artistic director in the 1920s, and the other by Soviet historians bent on glorifying the role of the Soviet government. The following two chapters are devoted to the 1920s and the theatre's renowned stylized adaptations of Jewish classics. They are informed by newly re- leased materials that document nasty shenanigans, some of them not altogether shocking to one familiar with the backstage politics of theatres dependent on state funding. This section of the book concludes with Goset's 1928 European tour and the defection of Granovsky, who had shaped its artistic language and persona. Veidlinger's most important contribution lies in the ensuing chapters, which are devoted to the lackluster and tightly controlled 1930s, an unsung decade in the- atre history, but a time of great interest to students of Soviet Jewry. In the after- math of Granovsky's departure, it was left to Goset's actor Solomon Mikhoels, its new director, to navigate the company through the increasingly difficult path of Soviet cultural and ethnic politics and to remold Jewish nationalism in conformi- ty with the ideological twists and turns of newly proclaimed dogmas, including so- cialist realism and cultural nationalism. Veidlinger traces Goset's efforts to reorient its style and message so as to adjust to the hardening political realities of the 1930s by presenting plays in the social-realist vein. The last part of the book is devoted to the war years and Mikhoels' involvement in the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. It concludes with the terminal postwar history of the company, hurled into institu- tional and personal destruction by intensified official anti-Jewish policies. The book's self-declared purpose is to demonstrate how Goset championed Jewish national culture. The author clarifies its central theme in the introduction: "while sharing many aspects of the state's educational ideals and class-based worldview, the Yiddish theater successfully resisted all attempts to turn its stage into just another platform of Soviet propaganda" (p. 3). The tenacious nature of this thesis is manifest in the portrayal of the theatrical enterprise, and particularly its leader, Solomon Mikhoels, as a steadfast force carefully navigating turbulent 352</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Soviet waters. The result of this heroic interpretation is that the theatre's shifting repertoire and production styles are seen as largely reactive, the result of the im- pact of external forces and hardly the product of creative maturation. Veidlinger posits that many of the theatre's productions included a nationalist Jewish subtext that eluded the censor but was calculated to evoke deep national sentiments in Jew- ish audiences, who were able to read between the lines. Although this subversive interpretation may be valid in some cases, the author does not factually substanti- ate the thesis and occasionally stretches his argument beyond logical and histori- cal credibility. For example, he suggests that the collective suicide of the besieged Vilna Soviet delegates at the end of M. Daniel's civil war play Four Days would remind the audience of the heroism of the Zionist Masada myth. However, there is no evidence that the Masada story was a part of the cultural consciousness of Rus- sian Jewish spectators by 1931. Similarly, the author attaches much importance to Mikhoels' thoughtful attention to hand gestures, particularly as related to playing the lead in Bergelson's The Deaf and interprets this interest as related to the Zion- ist commitment expressed in Psalm 137: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand lose its cunning ... ." Such undocumented speculations detract from the strength of the overall argument. Although Goset's journey is chronicled in great detail by the author, who is well grounded in the vicissitudes of Soviet Jewish political and cultural life, the intense focus on the politics of Jewish national culture, for which the author uses the theatre as an example, leads to a certain flattening of the artistic landscape. By the book's end, the reader is left hesitant regarding the significance of Goset as a theatrical institution. How noteworthy were its artistic achievements? Where would one position it within the overall theatrical map of the period? Was it in the same league as Tairov's or Vakhtangov's theatres, or was its role more ethnic than artistic? Extant Jewish and Russian materials would have helped to clarify some of these questions. Eyewitness histories of the Russian stage offer rather objective an- swers by virtue of the attention they grant Goset. Konstantin Rudnitsky's Russian and Soviet Theater 1905-1932, for example, discusses the extraordinary acting skills of Mikhoels and Zuskin and emphasizes their creative interaction. This col- laboration reached its artistic zenith in Goset's renowned production of King Lear, when they captivated Moscow in the roles of King and Fool. The origins of Lear's bold directorial concept are shrouded in mystery. Veidlinger credits Sergei Radlov as the director, yet Rudnitsky's history rejects this official credit. He argues that Radlov was a tame director, by then not capable of the creative spirit manifest in the production. He suggests that the directorial concept was developed by Les Kur- bas, an innovative Ukrainian director who, like Granovsky, had been a student of Max Reinhardt. Kurbas, whose unique directorial style was characterized by a sharp graphic quality and a dynamic rhythm that earned him the nickname "the Ukrainian Meyerhold," was imprisoned before the completion of Lear. So it was left to Radlov, the lesser director, to finish and "sign" the production. True, Rud- nitsky offers no proof for his version of events, but his narrative is presented with much confidence that demands either confirmation or denial. Another issue that requires discussion is Granovsky's artistic impact. Was he 353</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews a great director? A merely competent one? By all accounts he was intellectual and pedantic, the sort of director who used a metronome in his work with actors. Again, it may be instructive to look at Russian theatre sources that precede his defection. Huntly Carter, a British scholar who saw many of the Soviet productions of the 1920s and discussed them in detail in his ground-breaking book The New Spirit in the Russian Theatre 1917-1928, paid considerable attention to Granovsky's work. In a subchapter devoted to the persons he identifies as the "Practical Builders" of the new Russian theatre, Carter offers a list of "the big five," consisting of Gra- novsky, Lunacharski, and the path-breaking directors Meyerhold, Tairov, and Stanislavsky. Was Carter correct in this assessment? Did he reflect the professional theatrical views of the time? A discussion of such theatrical issues would have enriched the largely polit- ical tapestry woven by Veidlinger. In addition, given the large number of produc- tions covered, it is unfortunate that the book does not include an appendix with a chronological list, offering such basic information as playwright, translator, direc- tor, designer, choreographer, and composer. These names are included in the body of the text, but a list of productions-a standard feature in theatre history books- would have provided a clear road map and serve readers interested in specific as- pects of the theatre's artistic history. These comments should not detract from Veidlinger's immense contribution. His meticulous research presents a richly detailed and cohesive picture. It is in- strumental in introducing English-language readers to a storied chapter in the his- tory of modern Jewish creativity and will undoubtedly trigger future study into the various aspects of the Moscow State Yiddish Theatre.
