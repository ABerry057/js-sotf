<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 27:1 (2003), 73-88 No WAY OUT: BRENNER AND THE WAR by Glenda Abramson The second Aliyah brought a large number of Hebrew authors to Palestine, some of them among the greatest Hebrew writers of all time.' Those who remained endured the privations of the First World War, which became particularly severe throughout its final year, but few of them wrote about it. In fact, within the large corpus of belletristic writing in Hebrew and Yiddish at the time, there is little de- voted to the Jewish experience in the First World War. Many critics and scholars of the period, in addition to later commentators, affirmed (and some lamented) that the output of Jewish war writing was modest in Yiddish as well as Hebrew.2 Nonetheless there exists a substantial body of such work about which little is known to this day. At the time, it seems, Hebrew literature had to serve greater aims than the individual responses of soldiers in a foreign war soon after the Balfour Declaration. The most powerful responses were, with some notable exceptions,3 written some time after the events or by writers, such as Y. H. Brenner, who were not combatants but were victimized by the war nonetheless.4 Brenner rarely avoided incorporating political and social realities into the microcosm of his stories, and Palestine in 1918 offered him an opportunity to use the war period to further his literary preoccupations. He wrote seven stories about conditions in Palestine during the war, only one of which, Hamosa, is well known. The others are four tersely titled sketches (written in 1917 and 1918): Gazlanim (Robbers), Asonot (Tragedies), Seva'ah (A Will) and Mazal (Luck), which Bren- ner collected under the title Zeeir sham (Here and There). They were first published in Hapo'el Hasa'ir in 1919. The fifth story, Avlah, which does not belong to the group, was first published in Ha'adamah in 1920, and added to Zecir sham by a publisher a few years later. The longest and most accomplished of the stories, 1. U. N. Gnessin (1907), David Shimoni (1909), S. Y.Agnon (1907), Y. H. Brenner (1909), and Dvora Baron (1911). 2.

Comparatively little has been written in any literary genre about the overall Jewish experi- ence in the First World War when compared to the body of writing about the Jewish civilian experience in Europe and the yishuv at that time. For example, the consequences for the Jews of occupation in Eastern Europe were noted by very few authors. Of the 32 or so known Hebrew authors who partici- pated in the war in any capacity, not more than a dozen devoted space to the war in their work. In con- temporary and later anthologies of Hebrew and Yiddish verse, the war poetry even of canonical poets is absent, replaced by their more generally Jewish work. 73</page><page sequence="2">Glenda Abramson Hamosa, was published in Ha'aretz veha'adamah in 1919. A seventh, Hage'ulah vehatemurah, was published posthumously. Within the vast corpus of Brenner scholarship all but one of these stories are ignored. Yet they are not without importance within his corpus. They provide, on the one hand, a clear illustration of his particular methodology of realism and on the other an insight into life on the yishuv during the closing stages of the war. It is difficult to separate the fictional from the historical because, as usual, Brenner drew heavily on documented events and eyewitness records which, together with his own experiences at this time, provided him with a wealth of political and ex- istential material. However, his primary purpose in writing these war stories was not to provide a sociological account of the effects of the war on the Jews in north- ern Palestine or to offer an historical review of its progress. It was to write the "truth" in which the war is less an event than an abstract trigger for his subjective consideration of Jewish response. In other words, he uses the war situation to ex- press his pessimistic view of diaspora Jewry, albeit transplanted to Palestine, and the negative, self-immolating responses of the displaced Jews to their new catas- trophe. In these stories he offers an ironic composite portrait of Jewish destiny: even in the Promised Land, Jewish fate is unchanged. Ultimately the war stories serve as an example of Brenner's "symbolic realism"5--the baring of the inner nature of life and human selfhood. In keeping with his aesthetic philosophy,6 Bren- ner represents the grim realities of Jewish life even in the Holy Land. In a letter to Fischel Lachover, he writes: "I have my own truth, which is one and the same, both in the 'diaspora' and in Eretz Israel."7 Also, as I demonstrate in this paper, his sto- ries provide us with a detailed account of life caught between the two warring sides and provide one of the few examples of fiction in Hebrew directly about the First World War. The framework of the stories is the final year of the war after the expulsion from Jaffa and Tel Aviv, when the British army was approaching from Egypt to the south of Palestine, with the northern area still under Turkish rule. In October 1917 the Turkish army evacuated Tel Aviv, Jaffa, and the southern regions of Palestine, forcing their Jewish populations to flee. Most of them moved northward to Petah Tik- vah (from which they were later expelled), Kfar Saba, and Hedera, among others. 5. In his formulation, realism is not a matter of simple mimesis but something more profound, struggling for the truth of life that literature is able to reveal. "[Hauptmann] demonstrates-in the way in which he elevates people from a known and limited environment and puts into the mouths of every one of them his own words, the absolute truth, an echo of the heart-what profound true reality is, in which day-to-day lives are exalted to become a symbol to the point of the essential revelation of life and its sources."

Brenner discussed this for- mulation in his play Me'ever legevulin (1907) whose protagonist Yohanan delineates "symbolic real- ism" as both a technique and a philosophy of artistic creation. 6. Brenner's view transcends simple definitions of both realism and nationalism. The greatness of literature is derived from its awareness of reality "as it is," rather than the sentimental idealization of it. He deems bad literature to be that which distances itself from reality and therefore implicitly from the life of the nation. See Parush, p. 270. 7. Nurit Govrin, Alienation and Regeneration.

Some 10,000 Jews with foreign citizen- ship who had not been "ottomanized" were forced to leave the country. By 1918 the number of Jews in Palestine had been reduced to about 56,000 from approxi- mately 90,000 at the start of the war. A Refugee Committee was established to as- sist the evacuees, but by all accounts it was largely ineffective. As always in times of catastrophe, profiteers and black-marketeers exploited their own people to amass wealth, and the authorities' indifference completed the dismal picture. By December 1917, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv were in British hands, as was the southern region of the country, including Gaza. The northern settlement re- mained under Turkish rule, and many of the Jewish refugees found themselves close to the front lines.8 After severe fighting, in which the Turks often held the upper hand, at midnight on September 19, 1918, the British artillery bombardment began. General Edmund Allenby resumed the northward offensive that had ended a year earlier with the capture of Jerusalem, and his army advanced rapidly north- ward through the coastal plain. The Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force bombed the German and Turkish installations at Afula, Nablus, and Tulkarm. For a week, as Allenby's cavalry progressed, the bombing of roads, railways, and troop concentrations disrupted all the Turkish and German defences.9 In October 1918 the entireyishuv community was liberated from Turkish rule, to come under British military administration. There was no one in Palestine whose life had not been affected by the war one way or another. Newspapers reported daily about the various fronts and pre- sented "telegrams" from around the world.' Leading articles debated the progress of the war and reported on the British victory with apparent and perhaps neces- sary impartiality. When the order of expulsion came to Petah Tikva, the situation worsened. The rainy season was approaching, making it impossible to continue liv- ing in tents. Those who refused to move away had their houses and property de- stroyed or looted. Soldiers would burst into homes, load household goods onto camels or carts and haul them off to the train station.1' During this period of the war, Brenner, with his wife and small son, had man- aged to rent a room in a farmer's house near Hedera, but they were required to va- cate it for the wealthy family of one of the members of the Refugee Committee12 and moved to Gan Shmuel. At the time of composition of his war stories (1919- 1920), Brenner was living in Tel Aviv. He had separated from his wife and she had taken their son, leaving Brenner unsettled and unhappy. He sold his furniture, moved out of his apartment in Tel Aviv, and took a small room in Jaffa where he eked out a living by teaching. He was killed by Arab marauders in an orange grove at Abu Kabir in May 1921. The four original stories of Zecir sham are themselves metonymies both of the yishuv and of the war. They contain little psychological dimension and are, 8. Aharon Zisling, "Behadera, bime hamilhamah," Yosef Hayyim Brenner: mivhar divre zikhro- not, Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1971, p. 207. 9.

This may perhaps be be- cause generally tellers of war experiences, like witnesses to the Holocaust, are con- scious of the discordance of their subject matter and its resistance to shaping and sense making.13 Because Brenner was not a combatant he was able to keep an emo- tional distance between himself and the experience and to retain his sense of space and time. It seems, therefore, that because of the great disparity in style and fin- ish between Zecir sham and Hamosa, written almost contiguously, the stories of Ze'ir sham served as verbal cartoons for Hamosa in their settings and characters, many of which are recapitulated in the longer story. The four original stories of Ze'ir sham reflect the point of view of the most vulnerable members of society, the women and children. Through narratives akin to nineteenth-century melodrama, the stories present an almost Dickensian panoply of cruel adults; poor, starving, or dead children; rich, greedy managers; loss and separation; orphans having to fend for themselves in the face of indiffer- ent, often harsh, authority. As if to underline the hardship, adults and children are ill with malaria and typhus. Also in Dickensian style,14 these stories include a cer- tain element of social criticism and satire and an ironic confirmation of the quirk- iness of human nature. While Brenner focuses on the effect of the war on Jewish society in Palestine rather than on individual psychology, there is still a strong el- ement of pathos, more effective for his emotional restraint. The first tale in the series, Gazlanim, tells of a grocer from Jaffa who suf- fers greatly after the expulsion to Petah Tikvah. His wife lies ill with malaria and his daughter pines for her old school in Herzliya, refusing to attend school in Petah Tikvah. The formerly prosperous grocer now has to earn his living by moving goods on a donkey cart, and to replace his helpless wife in taking care of the house- hold. He speaks to his daughter in Hebrew, but in times of great stress reverts to Yiddish. By serving one customer, the grocer has to break his word to another and compromise his honor. Each of the characters, in his or her own way, is a gazlan, but victimized by the greater gazlanut of the war. Food in the settlements and towns is unobtainable, and previously comfort- able families are close to starvation. The grocer in Gazlanim has had to move his family from a three-room house in Jaffa to a stable in Petah Tikvah. There is no money to buy supplies or to pay a doctor to tend to the sick wife. Permits are re- quired to move from city to city. In Asonot the exiles from Tel Aviv to Tiberias live in squalor on balconies and in cellars. Among them is a housewife who is cruel and selfish in her lack of understanding of the problems of the time, demanding the household standards of more prosperous days in Tel Aviv. She employs as a 12. Y.H Brenner, Mivhar divre zikhronot, p. 207. 13. In his study of the English literature of the First World War, The Great War and Modern Memory (Oxford University Press, 1975), Paul Fussell comments that the problem for the writer try- ing to describe the elements of the Great War was its utter incredibility, which made it incommunica- ble in its own terms. p. 139. 14. Brenner mentions Dickens once in his correspondence: in a letter to Sarah Mirmer he writes: "I won't be able to come for breakfast because I'm going to accompany Berkowitz to Waterloo Station ... I'll come in the late afternoon or in the evening to read Dickens." (2-8-1907). In Y H. Brenner, Kol Kitve, vol. 3, p. 314. 76</page><page sequence="5">No Way Out: Brenner and the War washerwoman an ignorant Tiberian girl who is torn between the need to earn a liv- ing and tending to her dying father. The girl recounts: There are many refugees from Jaffa in Tiberias, oh, a lot. She's from Tiberias, she is. It's very bad for the Tel Avi [sic] people in Tiberias. They have no food. They have no lodging ... They live like dogs. Sick, dying, dropping like flies. A catastrophe! (456) A contemporary account by an anonymous writer corroborates her depiction: In Tiberias there is overcrowding, cholera and other diseases. They don't let people come here [Petah Tikvah] and there there's nowhere to go. The situa- tion is dreadful.The public didn't want to go, they say: "It's better for us to die in Petah Tikvah. Let them kill us, let them do with us what they will, but we're not moving from this place."15 In Hasava'ah, perhaps the most touching of the stories, a child has lost his mother and sister to privation and illness under the Turks, while his father has es- caped to the comparative comfort of the British side. The boy, Nahum, now en- tirely alone, appears one day at a library, seeking a particular book. The overworked and harassed librarian pays little attention to him, but the boy returns again and again, asking for a book about dwarfs and a stepmother. Eventually he shows the librarian a letter he has found from his sister, Hannah, written to their mother. It describes the girl's life with a relative in Haifa, a woman not unlike the Tel Aviv housewife in the previous story. Hannah is forced against her will to do housework and is deprived of food and shoes. She has come across a storybook about dwarfs and she implores her brother to read it. She describes a moment of her life: She comes up to me and says Wash the dishes because it was after a meal and I was reading this book and I put the book down sadly and I took the dishes and I went because I couldn't answer her because tears fell from my eyes, and Mother, you'll think I'm lazy but I wasn't lazy, only just then I couldn't read this wonderful book but it's nothing, there are worse things that I can't tell you about in a letter ... (p. 458) Both Hannah and the mother are dead by the time Nahum discovers the letter. As in fairy-tales, the adults in these stories are heartless and heedless, from the shrewish relative in Haifa to the librarian, to the book borrowers waiting im- patiently in line at the library. Brenner's story is a tour de force of restraint, al- lowing the situation to speak through the cruel world of a fable. The allusion re- moves Hasava'ah from the realm of history to that of folktale, with evil external forces separating the family, and the appearance of a wicked substitute mother. To the children there is no cause and effect: the dire events take place in a distorted world where little is comprehensible to them. In most of these stories there is a negative relationship between mother or 15.

In Gazlanim and Mazal, circumstances have driven the child out of control. In the latter story, a group of Jewish refugees is crowded into a single unhygienic dwelling in Zikhron Yaakov. Many of them are ill with malar- ia. A woman cooks cholent, wipes the sweat from her face with a rag with which she then covers a bowl of fresh water. In her fever-induced mania, her young daughter, Shifra, incites the other children, all of whom are ill or weak. Among the group is the area supervisor who is also a member of the Refugee Committee. The story does not give reasons for his presence there, but clearly describes the attitude of the refugees to him: they conspire to keep food and water from him, and char- acterize him as "an enemy of the Jews." By her irresponsible and selfish actions Shifra wastes all the available water. Water is generally scarce, and on the Sabbath, as Brenner emphasises in the story, the standpipes and faucets are closed by offi- cial decree. A tailor, ill with malaria, blames the officials, the "brainless people ... who have decided the faucet will be closed on the Sabbath." The narrative is terse, based predominantly on dialogue, but the nightmarish atmosphere of waterless heat, both internal from the disease, and external, is mercilessly conveyed. Avlah (Injustice) is entirely different, with no reference to Dickensian indi- gence or illness, and cheerful in tone. It is a rounded narrative with a definite con- clusion, less of a sketch than a well-realized short story in which, again, the char- acters' responses are motivated by the war. This story is an example of Brenner's manipulation of real events to accord with a preconceived purpose: in this case to caution the Jews that the long-awaited British "friend" may ultimately not be a friend at all. At this time (1920), Joseph Trumpeldor and six of his comrades had been killed in an Arab attack at Tel Hai, which further depressed Brenner. He was worried by the Arab disturbances in Jerusalem and condemned the British for fail- ing to deal adequately with them. He wrote both bitterly and prophetically, "Per- haps tomorrow the Jewish hand writing these words will be stabbed, some 'sheikh' or 'hadj' will stick his dagger into it under the gaze of the British ruler . .. and this, this hand will not be able to do anything to the sheikh or the hadj because it doesn't know how to hold a sword."'6 The story tells of the arrival at a small, isolated kevusah of an officer ini- tially thought to be German. Most of the members of the group greet the exhausted and rain-drenched foreign officer with some awe and offer him their meagre hos- pitality. However, once they have determined that the man is British and an escaped prisoner-of-war, some of them fear reprisals from the Turks for hiding an enemy soldier. After sheltering him for a night, during which they debate the problem in a parody of the popular sihah of the time, 7 they eventually decide to give him up to the authorities, They then suffer agonies of remorse and shame for their cow- ardice and betrayal. Brenner presents their changes of mood with the best of his satirical pen. 16. In Adir Cohen, Yesirato hasifrutit shel Yosef Hayyim Brenner. Guma: TA, 1976, p. 80. 17. One of the characteristic activities of some of the early kevusot was the sihah or 'discus- sion', which frequently became a confessional group session consisting of monologues and public con- fessions where members bared their innermost secrets.

We were grieving, in mourning. The noble face of the Englishman was like an hallucination to us. There was no fire in our house that day, food was an abomination to our souls. At noon one of us tried to chew on a piece of dry bread, but it stuck in his throat. A man came from the moshavah and told us that the moshavah is abuzz, everyone is blaming us for our treach- ery (pahazut), everyone is streaming to the commandant's house to see the English officer; that the prisoner spoke in French and no one protested; and mainly that he said to one of the people: "Now I know all about the Jews. .. " Yes, his verdict is true, we are the lowest! We deserve to be torn from life! (p. 461) They then learn that the officer has lost his watch, and they suspect a Turkish soldier of stealing it. When they are told that the officer has blamed them they are able to relinquish their guilt at having surrendered him. "Antisemitic gentile like all the gentiles!" Our religious comrade opened his mouth for the first time in a day and night. "Good, good." We all suddenly felt better. "Now-it's good ..." As if a weight had been lifted from us. (p. 461) Brenner's version is particularly interesting for having been closely based on a true event. The officer himself, Major A. J. Evans, Commanding Officer of the 14th Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps in Palestine, described the events that Brenner was later to immortalize in his story, as "sheer comedy."'8 After an ardu- ous three-day walk to the south from Caesarea, he reached a house where he de- cided to seek shelter. I banged on the door and after a minute or two it was opened by a small dark man in trousers and shirt and bare feet. He appeared rather frightened, and said some words which I did not understand. I tried him in German, saying that I wanted shelter and food. As I had had practically nothing to eat for sixty hours, and was drenched to the skin, he had no difficulty in guessing what I wanted, if he did not understand. He went back into the room and put on some boots and a coat. The room seemed almost completely bare except for a number of people who were sleeping, rolled in blankets, on the floor or on very low beds.19 Evans persuaded the frightened group of Jewish settlers to shelter him by agree- ing that they could send for the Turks in the morning. They gave him food and a bed. Evans remarked on their kindness, their food, which he found to be almost inedible, and their poverty. During the night he was arrested by the Turks. When he complained to the Arab guard that his feet and shoes were in no condition for 18. A. J. Evans, The Escaping Club. London: John Lane, The Bodley Head, 1921. 19. Evans, p. 227. 79</page><page sequence="8">Glenda Abramson walking , "whether at his order or out of kindness-the latter, I think-one of the Jews brought me a pair of old boots .... ."20 He continues: Though the Jews had immediately sent word to the Turks, I feel no violent re- sentment towards them, as they were obviously frightened out of their skins at my presence in the house. In other ways I think they did their best for me, and were sorry for me; owing to their extreme poverty they could not do much. I suppose they just had licence to live from the Turks, and that's about all ... Just before we marched off the Jews gave me some more of their disgusting meat and, when I reproached them for sending for the Turks so soon, they an- swered that they were terrified and could not help it. When we had gone a few hundred yards from the house I saw suddenly that my wrist-watch was miss- ing. I made the Arab [soldier guarding him] understand by signs, and let him know that I wanted to go back and fetch it. He refused, and when I showed signs of obstinacy, began to finger his revolver. So we continued the march. I made sure then that the brute had stolen it.21 Without knowing Evans' comment about "sheer comedy" (his account was published in 1921), but with a startling fidelity to the details of his story, Brenner gave 'Avlah a comic tone that contrasted strongly with the tone of the other war stories. He added a female to the all-male group of settlers, in order to provide a hint of romance and a dissident voice in the argument. The English officer's ac- cusation of the Jews, the eponymous "injustice" of the story, does not appear in Evans' account. The incident of the watch gives Brenner a narrative opportunity both to high- light the settlers' comic guilt at their betrayal and to resolve it in a satisfactory feat of closure. He also mocks the diaspora Jews' negative self-image and their need- ful assumption of victimhood. More significantly, however, this incident allows him to make a pointed comment by reinforcing the stereotype of the antisemitic British. Brenner suggests that through accusing the innocent Jews of betrayal, the English officer himself, despite his gentility and his representing the liberating force, is not to be trusted. In the face of the yishuv s expectations of the British, Brenner provides a negative assessment of them and perhaps even a warning in the aftermath of the war and the beginning of the Mandate. In the ironically titled Hage'ulah vehatemurah (Salvation and [Its] Price), which is more a documentary observation than a story, Brenner reinforces his neg- ative view of Britain by his depiction of the British army. This story was found among Brenner's papers, edited and ready for publication, and it was first pub- lished in Hatekufah in Warsaw in 1921. The setting is a cooperative farm (Mer- havia) in Emek Yizrael. The central character, an old man, Leyzer-Nahman, de- tests the German soldiers, considering them little better than swine, intent only on drinking. He awaits the British ("Dod Yankel" in the settlement's code) and watches their arrival as if they were a heavenly host: "He lifted up his eyes and saw riders approaching from the mountains from the south east, their unsheathed 20. Evans, p. 228. 21. Ibid. 80</page><page sequence="9">No Way Out: Brenner and the War swords glittering in the sun." At first he mistakes them for Bedouins, but on dis- covering that they are British, "tears were in his eyes and he nodded his head at one of the forward horsemen in amazement, with an acknowledgement of appre- ciation, with joy.. ." However, he is soon disillusioned. "Why didn't you come sooner?" He addressed the horseman in a German bro- ken by his intense emotion. "We've waited so long for you..." The Scottish horseman asked for Cognac. (p. 463) Events go from bad to worse. The settlers are marched off to a military camp and forced to wait for hours in the sun without food or water before being allowed to return to their farm. Leyzer-Nahman, exhausted and deprived of food or drink, becomes ill, reminiscent of the old teacher in Hamosa. No doctor will visit him because of the need for a travel permit. The old man sadly mutters, "You will live by the sword ... why does it have to be me?" and then, presumably, dies. Leyzer Nahman is sketched in outline, as if in pen and ink, but with a certain pathos. Yet this character, and other peripheral characters, are no more than devices to provide an illusion of fiction for Brenner's pointed description of the British forces, including an Indian cavalry regiment, who are as indifferent to the local pop- ulation as were the Germans. The story offers a view of the realities of war, devoid of the romantic illusions fostered by Leyzer Nahman. During the course of the tale, Brenner subtly alters the perceptions of the British and the Germans: from being drunken hazirim, the German soldiers are then portrayed as pathetic prisoners of war, thin and tired, and later, in Leyzer Nahman's memory, as courteous and cultured. The Indian forces, on the other hand, are scarcely better than the Turks. Over all is the chaotic, incomprehensible disorder of war, void of consideration for its innocent vic- tims. Alcohol defines both sides: the Scottish soldiers demand Cognac, their officers search the houses for wine abandoned by the Germans. The most complex short story and the culmination of this series is Hamosa, a structured and evocative work. Written in 1919 at the same time as the others, a short time after the events it describes, it seems to have shaken off the sympathet- ic but rather wry attitude of the sketches to delve more deeply into the conditions of the time and the lives of the war's victims. In total contrast to Zecir sham, the style of Hamosa is the naturalism of the period, a profoundly pessimistic, entire- ly Brennerian, delineation of desperate times. It also contains a bitter comment on the obduracy of officialdom in times of great human suffering. It is the outcome of the sketches in Zeeir sham, including almost all the characters but above all in its Manichean view of the world of the refugees and their antagonists, the officials in the settlement. The specific event that seemed to have been the basis for Hamosa, was de- scribed in detail by an eyewitness, Aharon Zisling, a young acolyte of Brenner's, and confirmed by others. Zisling wrote a vivid account of the events Brenner lat- er fictionalized in the story.22 While this account confirms Brenner's fidelity to ac- 22. Daniel Ben Nahum, Reshut haza akah: hazarah el Brenner, Sifriat Poalim, 1972, p. 130ff. 81</page><page sequence="10">Glenda Abramson tual events, at the same time it reveals the small but very significant manipulations of reality that typify his writing. In 1918, as a boy of about 16 or 17, Zisling hap- pened to be in Hedera with Brenner when a large group of refugees was concen- trated in a camp near Kfar Saba, close to the border dividing the country into its two opposing forces. Not only was the Refugees' Committee generally unsympa- thetic to the displaced population, but the Hedera farmers also raised the price of wheat, which greatly aggravated the refugees' situation. Kfar Saba contained about 10 houses and about 1,000 people from Tel Aviv and Jaffa camping wherever they could. Since their camp was adjacent to a logging station, they constructed huts made of branches and cloth, and also found living space in stables, cowsheds, and tents. In the cold, damp winter, many of them died of illnesses such as malaria, and typhus caught from brackish water, and they fared no better in the hot sum- mer. One member of the Refugee Committee, appalled at what he was witnessing, complained, in a public notice appended to the wall of the committee house, about the indifference of the people of Hedera to the fate of the refugees. It is possible that this action gave Brenner the idea of a single voice of opposition to the com- placency of the members of the settlement. Brenner actively campaigned for help. As an invited member of the com- mittee, he pleaded on behalf of the refugees, he assisted individuals among them without a thought for the danger to himself of infection, he gave away what little food he had, he would carry sacks of bread, sweep the yards, organise carts. He was, in Zisling's words, "totally alight with the affairs of the refugees and he knew everything about them." Another witness reports: One day Brenner came to me with some of his shirts and he asked me to make garments from them for the children. Many of the refugee children didn't ac- tually have clothing for their bodies. Then I saw him taking care of one fam- ily-a father who was not in his right mind and his daughter whose mother had recently died. Every day he would buy milk and bring it to the little girl, feed her and teach her how to keep the "room" clean: a dark corner of the cow- shed. He himself cleaned the dwelling every day and told the girl to look af- ter her father, and told her about order, and in this way he would entertain her. This family was not the only one he looked after, because when he finished in this cowshed he went to a second yard, from family to family, every hour in the afternoon and in the evening.23 Against the settlement's regulations, those assisting with the disinfection of the refugees allowed a young woman and her sick child to take refuge in the camp's ablution area. The child died during the night, and a Yemenite was summoned from a nearby farm to bury her. Brenner himself carried the child to its grave. It has been said that Hamosa foreshadows the Holocaust, and, indeed, many of its descriptions of conditions in the refugee camp, the dehumanization of its in- habitants, and even its language have an eerie resonance. In the story the word "transport," for example, is a transliteration of the English word. However, the sto- 23. Ahavah Remez, cited by Cohen, p. 76. 82</page><page sequence="11">No Way Out: Brenner and the War ry is not a prophetic prolepsis; Brenner is describing the well-known global corol- laries of war: displaced civilians driven from their homes, gathered together in harsh conditions. Brenner's delineation is all the more shocking, given other opti- mistic, "naive, simple, simplistic and direct"24 fiction about life in the new yishuv. As a naturalist, Brenner might have exaggerated the refugees' privations, but even allowing for this, his quasi-documentary portrayal is far removed from Zionist pro- paganda or the "Eretz Yisrael genre."25 This story is, again, both a historical account and a didactic allegory. Bren- ner universalizes Hamosa by omitting place names, that of the moshavah, for ex- ample, which was HIedera. The story can be read as a criticism of the attitude of the moshavot to the refugees, as a criticism of the refugees themselves, as an au- tobiographical fragment in which the author is represented by a workers' teacher, or as a general portrayal of people in conditions of upheaval and catastrophe. It depicts a group of evacuees who have been gathered in a camp, called only "that place" after the expulsion from their homes. From that place, whose earth was desolate, its trees hewn down and its dwellings destroyed; from that place where four or five farmers paid the sol- diers living in their houses to cut down the remainder of their almond trees and bring them for heating; from that place, where unground millet was the only bread, to fill the belly, to stave off hunger; from that place where damp huts filled with vermin, mice and insects and the stench of many months gave a sad shelter to women and children frozen by the cold of winter and twisted by illness; from that place where every day four or five souls out of a hundred were brought dead outside the camp; from that place where there was nothing on which to lay the tens of new patients arriving daily, no garment in which to dress them and no sheet to spread beneath them; from that place whose dwellers did nothing, didn't lift a finger for their own comfort, and their only efforts were to listen for the shots, to argue about the tactics of the war and to groan and complain: "Woe, the Refugee Committee has caused our troubles! It has killed us!" From that place where people who knew how to steal and rob and do business gathered wealth, collected Napoleons, and groups of healthy young men from the north ate eggs and jam, played cards day and night and waited for salvation that was taking its time to come (p. ). The refugees' situation is desperate. Incapable of fending for themselves, they quarrel and cheat each other, depriving the community of spirit that might have 24. Govrin, p. 105. 25. Brenner's dismissal of the so-called "Eretz Yisrael genre" stems directly from his idea that writing relates more to the inner than to the outer life, and that it demands truthfulness. He strongly op- posed the tendency to seek an "easy escape" by portraying the lived situation as a kind of unwarrant- ed utopia. This, in his view, is only a pretense of normality springing from mendacity, "arrogance and fraud" in the portrayal of life on the yishuv. This falsification of reality represents an attempt to give the reader a misleading impression of revival and the yishuv while, on the contrary, the yishuv was small and insignificant, a continuation of exile The genre "s practitioners, he wrote, imputed false nor- mality to the yishuv which, in his view, was "mere pretense," since the reality was far from idyllic (Bren- ner, "Hagenre ha'eres-yisraeli va'avizrayhu," Kol kitve, vol.2, pp. 268, 269). 83</page><page sequence="12">Glenda Abramson brought mutual benefit. They have lost all vestiges of humanity, each individual concerned only about himself, placing the responsibility on others, including the "committee." Brenner spares no one: those who do nothing to help themselves, wasting time and energy, and those who amass fortunes at others' expense. It is not a clear-cut portrait of victims and victimizers as one might imagine from Bren- ner's frenzied espousal of the victims' cause, but a sharp look at responses to vic- timhood with the war as a catalyst. Brenner's emphasis on the refugees' unpleasantness is exemplified by a young woman who sends a boy to bring water from a fetid marsh because it is near- by rather than fetching pure water from the settlement a little further away. When another of the people leaves the camp, others quarrel over his hut until they de- stroy it altogether. These scenes transcend naturalism to adopt the brutality of ex- pressionism. The refugees squabble for places on a heavily-laden cart, but achieve nothing. "After the great fuss, cries, curses, gnashing of teeth, complaints, claims, advice, suggestions and jokes, most of the convoy stayed put in the field that day too." On the didactic level the story emphasizes Brenner's philosophy of Zionism. According to Boas Evron, The most acidic ingredient in [Brenner's] portrayals is disgust with Jewish weakness, the impotent, lachrymosity, the helpless ineffectuality and their in- evitable attendant evils: self-piety, cowardice, slyness, twisted mentality, gar- rulity, the compensatory stale self-importance, accompanied necessarily by flinching in encounter with the firm, hard real world, the world of action and power of the goyim ... it is no accident that both Brenner and Borochov be- came spiritual fathers of the Zionist labour movement . .. only [their] merci- less analysis, their unflinching gaze at the darkest aspects of reality, their readiness to adopt the principles of Marxist criticism and praxis, could achieve the transformation of weakness into power. And a precondition for power was the power to recognise and describe weakness.26 One of Brenner's convictions was that even in Palestine, there was little change in Jewish character and life, for the Jew brought exile with him to the new land.27 Ac- cording to Brenner, the Jews were a nation "devoid of the talent for executing what they wanted to execute ... . Any crowd of Jews assembled in Jerusalem was no different from a Jewish crowd in any other ghetto and in any other part of the world."28 An old workers' teacher takes matters into his own hands, and struggles to find food and aid for the people, and to infuse into them some modicum of self- reliance. It is not difficult to see a self-portrait in this character, and the fact that he is an old man may indicate Brenner's sense of his own helplessness. The un- 26.

Brenner's attitude is reminiscent of the views of Otto Weininger, whose treatise on the Jew- ish character, Sex and Character, had been published in 1903. 28. See Govrin, p. 112. 84</page><page sequence="13">No Way Out: Brenner and the War named teacher rushes about searching for food, he shares the refugees' physical discomfort by sleeping with them under the stars despite his malaria, he implores the committee officials to render assistance. The bleak factuality gives way to satire in Brenner's portrait of the self-satisfied, well-fed Jewish apparatchiks, one of the most effective in the story. "In that case, is it possible to buy the millet?" asked the Chairman. "They want thirty-nine majids for each vessel!" "Really," cried the Chairman, "we must buy. They're not paying atten- tion to prices right now." "It seems you have a few vessels of millet to sell?" Immediately the house was filled with wheat traders and brokers. The deputy chairman put his hands into his trouser pockets and pulled out fistfuls of gold napoleons. The voice of one broker was heard joking, "Never mind. The refugees aren't pigs-they'll eat this millet ... " "Half of it is soil." "No matter.""29 The committee's indifference is equivalent to the attitude of the military leaders described in English war poetry, the opposition of a cynical "them" and "us," their victims. The teacher in Hamosa fails to achieve any relief for the refugees and the tragedy of a baby's death from starvation deeply affects him, signaling the onset of a kind of madness. He attempts to persuade members of the camp to help him bury the child, but no one comes forward. Finally, a Turkish soldier, as tattered and poor as the Jewish victims, digs the grave and sympathetically remains for the bur- ial. The teacher rewards him with some cigarettes, a piece of cheese, and a coin. At the end of the story the old man seems to be dying of an injury, an equivocal one because, despite its seriousness, it has released him from his obligations to the suffering refugees. Then a great sorrow came into his heart because he had left a loaf [of bread] behind and he had not taken the two whole loaves. "A pity, a pity," he thought, "every slice of bread now . . " But it was a passing sorrow, and against it there was a great relief in his heart. At a distance of ten minutes walk, a hard, un- pleasant night spread its wings on the third transport of refugees. Sixty-nine souls who had arrived at noon, not the designated time. He knew this. The stu- dent-labourer had told him on the way. But nothing touched him. He didn't go out. He couldn't walk. It was relief. This is the teacher's way out: hamosa, his physical inability to do anything more.30 He has not lost the battle but has been forced to retire wounded. It is, at least, an 29. Farmers in Hedera sold wheat and millet for twice or three times the normal price set by other farmers in the country. See Zisling, "Behadera bime hamilhamah," p. 208. 30. Yosef Even writes (207) about the word "mosa": while its root is obviously "y-s-a," (go out) it could also be "m-s-a" (find) as the opposite of " 'a-v-d" which Brenner uses often. The teacher's 85</page><page sequence="14">Glenda Abramson honourable defeat. Yet the ultimate absurdity of his story is that as a moral hero who battles valiantly against oppression, he dies not dauntlessly or by the sword, but by stubbing his toe. His "way out," an infected toe, is undignified, with Bren- ner's undercutting any idea of his heroism. The story is, therefore, entirely anti-ro- mantic in its treatment both of the putative hero and his suffering charges. In keep- ing with his didactic purpose, Brenner has subverted any possibility of real pathos. In fact his irony has subverted any possibility of stereotyping in the story: the hero is not heroic, the victims contribute in some measure to their own suffering, and those designated to render aid are more inimical than the hero's only friend, a rep- resentative of the force that brought about the dreadful circumstances! This sol- dier, agent of a great empire, is poor and ragged. The victims await salvation from the official enemy, and listen eagerly for his gunfire. According to Yosef Even, the question of the survival of the refugees has been turned into the personal and existential quest of an individual hero who is not a victim himself.31 Despite its factual basis, the story therefore represents a battle between positive and negative, the weak against the mighty, good and evil, as in the stories of Zecir sham. It becomes a question of individual morality, in which the external historical situation is internalized. The teacher acts on behalf of the oppressed, without any thought of reward, as a force of good for its own sake. As in Zecir sham, there is a certain Manichean element to the story: the "committee" is the classical evil antagonist whose task is to nullify the hero's righteous efforts. Once again, there is a fairy-tale opposition of right and wrong, innocence and the exaggerated grotesquerie of the villains. In reality-while there was a certain re- sistance on the part of the settlers-there were many hands willing to help the un- fortunate evacuees, both from within the camp and outside. In the story the strug- gle becomes a mythological one, between one righteous man and the forces opposing him. The hero-teacher sets out in the morning to do battle, and returns, defeated, at sundown. His mission on behalf of humanity fails utterly because of the nature of humanity itself. Despite the seriousness of his plight and its outcome, the teacher is in many ways a comic figure because of his constant failure to be heard, his ener- getic but fruitless efforts to help the helpless evacuees. Yet Brenner adds to his .character an element of pathos that is intensified by the teacher's strange isola- tion, particularly marked in the scene of the child's burial. Towards the end of the story, he is at a physical and emotional distance from the refugees as if no longer associated with them. His actual detachment from them is emphasized by his living on a farm rather than on a collective settlement, which places him in a different category from that of the city dwellers or agricultural workers. His frenzied activity on their behalf stems from his own need for a moral quest and a personal challenge: a war for justice, which he loses. When he hears news of a new transport he says: "then I was lost" [my emphasis], a comment more in- dicative of his own fate than of those he is trying to help. The refugees them- "found" solution is therefore ironic. Yosef Even, Omanut hasippur shel Y H Brenner. Jerusalem: Mos- sad Bialik, p. 207. 31. Even, p.205 86</page><page sequence="15">No Way Out: Brenner and the War selves have little part to play in what ultimately becomes a battle that transcends their specific fate. Yosef Even criticizes Brenner's portrayal of the Turk as inaccurate. He should, he writes, be a representative of a ruling power during wartime,32 but in fact he is an illiterate peasant, the stereotype of the noble savage, and the point of Brenner's story. With his torn clothing and tassle-less tarbush the soldier is representative of an empire in decay. Brenner is making a point about the instinctive compassion of this simple Turk contrasted with the self-centeredness of the refugees. Despite the fact that a Yemenite Jew had performed this selfless service in the true circum- stances, in his story Brenner rhetorically features the natural human kindness of a more primitive Turkish soldier to shame his unfortunate Jews. This point had al- ready been made by his portrayal of the carters, the Jew who refused to take a greater load on his cart, and the Arab who agreed to carry an increasing number of people and their possessions.33 This paper has discussed Brenner's presentation of the First World War and has also shown that his preoccupations-even obsessions-remained unchanged; on the contrary, he used the extraordinary, almost apocalyptic, circumstances fur- ther to reinforce them. All war literature is a rendering of true experience into fic- tive form, when "literary tradition and real life notably transect."34 Brenner's mtVi- er was the exploitation of this transection, in this case using not the war itself but the crisis it engendered to express not only his idcefixe but also certain moral or didactic ideas, and allowing us, by the way, to have an idea of what it was like there and then. Consequently, the war becomes a framework for his preconceived ideas even while he portrays its real effects on the community of which he is part.
