<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:2 (2004), 215-216 A WORD FROM THE EDITORS With this issue, we launch our joint editorship of the AJS Review. It is there- fore an appropriate moment to share with our readers our hopes and expectations for the intellectual direction of the journal. Some of what follows has already been articulated in a statement published in the AJS Perspectives (Spring/Summer, 2003) shortly after we assumed our tasks. We feel it bears repeating here for the sake of those who may not have seen the original article. We believe that we have inherited a healthy and important journal in the field of Jewish Studies, which, like the AJS itself, has made every effort to reflect the diversity of scholarship practiced among its members. We hope that the journal will continue to attract contributions from the various disciplinary perspectives brought to bear in the Academy on the materials of Jewish history and culture. We look forward, moreover, to receiving submissions from colleagues with interests in Jewish Studies that might not have been represented before, as well as from in- dividuals beyond the field of Jewish Studies who might now find in our journal food for thought with regard to their own areas of study. Given the above-mentioned goals, we recognize that we have staked out a specifically interdisciplinary framework as the guiding principle of the journal. In this, of course, there is nothing revolutionary. "Interdisciplinarity" has long been a buzzword of the Academy. So let us try here to clarify what interdisciplinarity might mean in the pages of the AJS Review. First, we encourage submissions in traditional fields of Jewish inquiry that employ and contribute to a variety of dis- ciplinary paradigms within the humanities and social sciences. Thus, for example, sociologists should feel free to be sociologists rather than anthropologists; but we will look for sociological work that is framed in such a way as to invite inquiry from other disciplinary perspectives. We will also, however, value explicit efforts to integrate a variety of disciplines into a single project. Second, we are interested in research that expands the framework of Jewish Studies into new areas, or broad- ens the awareness of data relevant to the study of the Jewish experience in its var- ious contexts and social settings. In view of our interdisciplinary concerns, we also hope to be attentive to emerging debates and discussions that are currently known to specialists, but which deserve broader attention because of their implications for other areas of Jewish Studies scholarship. Accordingly, we hope from time to time to devote en- tire issues of the journal to introducing key arguments and lines of research that are changing the shape of their fields and have the potential to reshape discourses in other fields as well. In conclusion, we look forward to this opportunity to stimulate and help shape one of the truly distinguished academic traditions of the modern Universi- ty-the study of Jewish civilization in all of its historical, geographical, and cul- tural breadth.
