Detroit, MI: Wayne University Press, 2004. 349 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000402 One of the most remarkable developments in Israeli cultural life during the past three decades has been the outburst of Hebrew literary activity among women, both in poetry and in prose. Hebrew literature, a domain once dominated by men, is now effectively and confidently overrun by women. This, as we all well know, was not the case as recently as the 1970s. In fact, throughout Jewish history, ancient and modem, women were "conspicuously absent" from the Hebrew literary canon, as Wendy Zierler notes, their voices hardly heard or publicly displayed. The flurry of women's literary writing in Israel has been matched by a flurry of scholarly works about women's writing, mainly by prominent Israeli scholars, both men and women. A few studies have preceded Zierler's investigation of the emergence of women's writing in Hebrew in the nineteenth and twentieth centu ries, such as Dan Miron's celebrated 1991 book, 'Imahot meyasdot, ahayot horgot (Founding Mothers, Stepsisters). The importance of Zierler's study is twofold: Notably, it is the first full-length investigation of this phenomenon in English. Second, unlike Miron and others who dismiss all literary activity by women before the Zionist settlement in Palestine during the first half of the twentieth century, Zierler's study accounts for every woman who wrote in Hebrew, begin ning with the Jewish-Italian Haskalah poet Rachel Morphogo, and includes two mostly forgotten prose writers from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centu ries, Sara Foner and Hava Shapiro, two women who never lived in "Erez Yisra 'el but produced literary works in Hebrew nevertheless. These writers, along with the others studied in this book?predominately well-known poets such as Rachel (Bluwstein), Yokheved Bat-Miriam, Esther Raab, and Leah Goldberg and prose 200</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews writers such as the celebrated Devorah Baron and the somewhat less known Shulamit Kalugay?all lived and wrote in 'Erez Yisra 'ael. In Zierler's account, all of these women writers should be equally con sidered the "founding mothers" of Hebrew literature, for each stmggled with and was finally able to overcome the many obstacles a Hebrew woman faced on entering this men-only club. The reason their achievements have been over looked, she claims, is that early Hebrew women's works were have never been read or analyzed from a strictly feminist perspective. Supported by a battery of leading French and Americans feminist theories that she impressively masters, Zierler overtly challenges all previous studies of early Hebrew women writers. Her main contention is that Hebrew women writers never intended to create a sep arate literary tradition for women, as Miron, for example, argues. These women's aim, she states, "in a real, self-conscious sense [was] to 'capture the literary terri tory of men'?to steal the language of the fathers as well as to create a works of literature that represents their unique, women's perspective on many time-honored themes and communal issues" (11). Identifying her female subjects as "thieves of language"?a well-known characterization of women who have captured the literary territory of men and suc cessfully used male language and male literary practices to represent their unique perspectives as women?Zierler's first and most impressive observation is that the biblical matriarch Rachel is a model of such theft. A meticulous reader of Hebrew classical texts, Zierler eloquently argues that as the famous story of Rachel's steal ing of Laban's idols {terafim) evolves in Genesis 31, the full charge of Jacob, the male protagonist, diminishes (2). To that end, she uses a wide range of midrashim, mefarshim (commentators), and contemporary scholarly observations on the meaning and significance of the terafim, finally asserting that Rachel was a "kind of voleuses de langue, an archetypal feminist writer who dares to steal across the borders of masculine culture, seize control of her cultural inheritance, and make it her own" (4). Though Rachel's model was followed by an "excruciatingly small" number of defiant women in the postbiblical era (23), as Zierler shows in her historical survey (Chap. 1), she continues to argue that the tradition of women's subversive writing did not begin in the nineteen and twentieth centu ries. Similarly, against other scholars who underscore the limited achievements of women's works in Hebrew prior to the Israeli era, Zierler insists that regard less of the many obstacles from without and the great "anxieties of authorship" from within (36), each of these women crossed a major border on her way to literary triumph: Each one found a way to penetrate the Hebrew canon, change the classical characterization of "woman," and render faithfully the inti mate experiences of the Hebrew woman by capturing the language of her fathers. Determined to investigate the strategy each of her subjects adopted in her "border-crossing," Zierler organizes the book as a "thematic and stylistic map ... [that in her view] tell[s] the story of first steps" (13). According to this map, the main challenges that early Hebrew women writers commonly faced were the biblical portrayal of women; the biblical and rabbinical convention of female 201</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews personifications of the Land of Israel; the long-standing theme of female barren ness; and finally, issues concerning women's exile from social, cultural, and reli gious communal spaces. In her textual, mostly intertextual analysis of the works she presents, Zierler demonstrates an impressive mastery of the Hebrew ancient sources she offers as evidence for her subjects' subversive intents. It is nevertheless unclear whether most of these early writers had any access to the primary Jewish sources that are now wholly available to the modem Jewish American woman. Moreover, when it comes to the writers who lived in 'Erez Yisra'el, the group that dominates this study (e.g., Rachel, Yokheved Bat-Miriam, and Esther Raab), it is more likely that the border these early women had to cross was the "masculi nity" of the evolving Israeli culture rather than the ancient Jewish traditions that the pioneers generally left behind. Still, And Rachel Stole the Idols is a major scholarly contribution to the study of early Hebrew women's writers. More often than not, it gives convin cing answers to the key questions that guide its author: (1) What does it mean for a woman to enter so belatedly a long-standing Hebrew literary tra dition, one in which women were frequently spoken about but hardly ever spoke in their own voices? (2) How could a Jewish woman become a writer in the Hebrew language, which she never spoke or learned formally? (3) How does a woman enter an all-male language and still articulate her experi ences as a female?
