The flare-up in the 1930s and 1940s of an intense, popularly based, pro-Nazi movement in South Africa, the Nationalists, provides the backdrop and climax for Milton Shain's study. Although he begins it in the 1830s with the first Jewish arrivals in Cape Town and the earliest glimmerings of anti-Jewish sentiment, the emergence of this potent movement among the Afrikaner population, under the shadow of the Great Depression and the Third Reich, undergirds the book. Shain sifts through the history of the Jews in South Africa and, more importantly, the evolution of a hodgepodge of mixed attitudes toward Jews among their white gentile neighbors, in order to understand the flowering of this organized and virulent antisemitism in the early and mid-twentieth century. The Roots of Antisemitism in South Africa joins a host of books, a number of them quite recent, like Leonard Dinnerstein's Antisemitism in America (1994) and Frederick Jaher's A Scapegoat in the Wilderness (1994) on the United States, Jeff Lesser's Welcoming the Undesirable: Brazil and the Jewish Question (1994), and Robert Levine's study of Cuba, Tropical Diaspora (1993), in locating the sources of antisemitism in "new" societies in the sloppy blend of local, modern conditions with the continuation of long-standing, heartily transplanted, European notions about the Jews. All of these studies, Shain's among them, emphasize the cozy coexistence of antisemitism and philosemitism in the same place and time, and the contradictory rhetoric about Jews in societies fundamentally committed to civic equality for individuals of the nondominant faith communities. All of them seek to explain the ways in which Europeans brought their antisemitism with them to various colonial settings. Shain's book, like the others which it joins, deals with transnational antisemitism in the context of the specifics of time and place. The dominant view in the study of South African history asserts that the racism directed against Jews in the 1930s and 1940s represented a new moment in that country's development. Shain emphatically deviates from this position. Whereas conventional historiography sees the Nationalists as an aberrant, time-specific response to the stresses of the 1930s, his chronological presentation of the rhetoric and behavior of white South African individuals and groups validates his interpretation and undermines the prevailing motif. Antisemitism took hold early and firmly among the whites of South Africa. Studded throughout this book are examples of the words and deeds of</page><page sequence="2">214 BOOK REVIEWS antisemites, or at least of critics of some aspect or another of the Jewish people, from the early nineteenth century onward. Variously condemned for dishonest business practices in the gold fields and the diamond mines, as grubby peddlers and purveyors of liquor to the native black population, as outsiders who would leave as soon as they made their fortunes, impoverished "Peruvians" (a term for Eastern European immigrants whose derivation Shain cannot unearth) who would drain the national vigor, international financiers, and Bolshevik invaders bent on creating a revolution, Jews captured the imagination of the white folks of South Africa across a broad swathe of the class structure. They saw in the Jews something-and the point is, anything-they did not like. While Shain's analysis rests on the existence of two ideational traditions toward the Jews in South Africa, one hostile, one welcoming, he has put most of his emphasis on the former. His title, The Roots of Antisemitism in South Africa, makes it clear from the onset that he believes that antisemitism outweighed philosemitism and therefore is the phenomenon to be explained. Shain's analysis also plays with the specifics of local conditions, that is, the South African context, and the European legacy. The whites who populated South Africa brought with them a set of ideas about Jews. The Afrikaners emerge here as the legatees of a tradition of Calvinist antisemitism, and Shain considers them to be the pivotal group in South African history, whose own politically and economically explosive situation made them the premier antisemites. Shain has made a substantial contribution to the emerging literature on antisemitism in colonially created new societies. He seems to want to link himself to another intellectual tradition, one that in American history is epitomized by Winthrop Jordan (whom Shain cites) in White Over Black (1968), Robert Berkhofer in The White Man's Indian (1978), and Ronald Takaki in Iron Cages (1979), who all assert, each in his own way, that the history of racism needs to be located in an in-depth analysis of the social and cultural landscape, in the mentalitd of the racist. That is, to return to Shain, an examination of South African imagings about Jews must be thoroughly grounded in the history of the non-Jews of South Africa, their ethnic, racial, class, and religious lives and how those changed over time. This needed to be done because Shain's book is not about Jews, but about gentile, white South Africans, and an analysis of their anxieties and aspirations is called for. Unfortunately, this Shain has not done. While The Roots ofAntisenmitism provides a veritable compendium of information about</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 215 what South African whites said and did vis-a-vis Jews, and it probably will become the text of note on this important subject, the deeper context is missed and the material on antisemitism comes to us disembodied from any dense discussion of the emergence of a South African identity, the evolution of widespread ethnic differences in South Africa, the specter of race, and the construction of a class system. To understand why white South Africans feared, admired, hated, and embraced the Jews, all at the same time, it is necessary to understand the white South African experience. Had The Roots of Antisemitism in South Africa truly unearthed the roots of these ideas rather than simply documenting the branches, it would have been an outstanding book.
