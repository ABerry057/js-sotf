SUNY Series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism, and Religion. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991. xviii, 343 pp. Steven D. Fraade's recent book, a commentary on Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy, is methodologically sophisticated, elegantly written, and cogently argued. In a brilliant and learned introduction, the author defines rabbinic midrash against the backdrop of ancient Jewish scriptural com- mentary in general, and locates the study of midrash within the framework of modem literary criticism. Perhaps most impressive, however, is the book's attention to detail, its painstaking description of how passages are infused with new meaning when placed in different contexts. The author describes subtle distinctions between the Sifre's traditions and parallels in other rabbinic collections, and shows how slight changes in context or terminology often alter a statement's meaning in significant ways. Statements within a larger web of commentary are subtly colored by memory of statements which precede, the author notes, and reevaluated when subsequent material is encountered. On a variety of issues, Fraade skillfully steers a middle course between rival methodologies, utilizing the strengths of the various approaches and avoiding their excesses. He appropriately rejects, for example, the claim of some scholars that the Sifre is to be read autonomously of all other rabbinic documents, and likewise rejects the opposing claim that all rabbinic texts are to be read together as an undifferentiated whole. Instead, Fraade pays careful attention to parallel sources which inform, but do not determine, his reading of the Sifre. Differences between the Sifre's traditions and traditions in contemporary documents are not contradictions to be reconciled in Fraade's view, but clues to subtle differences between the meaning of the parallel passages in their various contexts. The author also wisely steers a middle course when he argues that three factors must be given due weight in interpreting the Sifre's commentary, and carefully avoids the tendency of many exegetes to emphasize one factor at the expense of others. First, the Sifre systematically interprets Scripture, and several peculiar features of the Sifre's commentary are the result of the rabbis serious grappling with the meaning of the biblical text. Second, the Sifre responds to and is constrained by rabbinic traditions</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 195 and conventions. Third, the Sifre's responses to the inherited biblical and rabbinic material are conditioned by the "sociohistorical reality" of the commentary's editors. Fraade, for example, makes the important point that the Sifre is preoccupied with the role of rabbinic sages in communal affairs. He argues that historical reality during the third century explains this concern, since many rabbis sought centralized rabbinic control over the appointment of local officials. The author exhaustively describes several of the Sifre's major preoccupations, and convincingly draws connections between these preoccupations and historical reality in third-century Palestine. The character of Fraade's book as a detailed line-by-line commentary makes it difficult to assess adequately within the span of a brief review. Simply to state the book's conclusions would convey nothing of its richness. In the continuation, therefore, I will briefly summarize a portion of Fraade's commentary, although it should be borne in mind that even this approach, given limitations of space, requires abbreviation and therefore a measure of distortion of the author's arguments. Fraade, commenting on a story which describes an encounter between Rabban Gamaliel and Roman emisaries, argues persuasively that the Sifre's version of the story is more negative toward non-Jews than are versions found in parallel rabbinic sources. He observes that the Sifre's version is consistent with the compilation's generally unfavorable attitudes toward gentiles. The story is as follows: "It once happened that the government [of Rome] sent two officers, instructing them as follows: 'Go and disguise yourselves as converts, and find out what is the nature of Israel's Torah.' They went to Rabban Gamaliel at Usha, where they recited Scripture and studied Mishna, Midrash, Halakhot, and Aggadot. As they [=the officers] were taking their leave, they said, 'All of the Torah is pleasing and praiseworthy, except for one thing, and that is your saying, "What has been stolen from a gentile is permitted, while what has been stolen from an Israelite is forbidden," but we will not report this to the government.'" Fraade argues persuasively that the Sifre, in stating explicitly that the Roman officers disguised themselves as converts, increases the impact of the story's concluding reversal and depicts the Romans in a more negative light than do other versions which lack this detail. According to the Sifre, the Roman government deceived the Jews, and receives its comeuppance</page><page sequence="3">196 BOOK REVIEWS when it in turn is deceived by the officers. When combined with several other distinctions between the Sifre's versions of statements and versions in contemporary rabbinic compilations, this relatively minor detail forms part of a pattern of hostility toward the gentiles which very likely reveals the hand of an editor, in large part through the selection of versions which conform to the editorial perspective, but also through the subtle molding and reformulation of traditional sources. Even when Fraade's arguments on behalf of his position are con- troversial, they raise important methodological and conceptual issues. In discussing the above story, for example, Fraade argues as follows: (1) The law permitting gentile property stolen by a Jew was particularly offensive to non-Jews, as shown by the fact that in the Yerushalmi, Rabban Gamaliel declares the law inoperative because of gentile resentment. (2) The Sifre presupposes the continued applicability of this law, indicating that the Sifre, more so than other compilations, pointedly mocks the gentiles. That is, the Roman officers praise the Torah, which contains a law blatantly offensive to non-Jews. The law remains in force, an open insult to the Roman government. Fraade's argument here presupposes that the Sifre shares the Yerushalmi's belief that the law regarding Jewish theft of gentile property is more offensive to non-Jews than comparable discriminatory rabbinic laws. This argument raises the following methodological question: Can the key to understanding a particular passage be found in ideas perhaps presupposed by the passage in question but only stated explicitly elsewhere? When is it inadmissable to do so? In the case at hand, perhaps the Yerushalmi's belief is not shared by the Sifre. If not, then the Sifre does not more pointedly mock the gentiles by including this detail. It bears emphasizing that this methodological question bears on one of Fraade's arguments and has no affect on his interpretation as a whole. It should also be noted that the author's commentary on the introduction to the song of Moses (Deut. 32:1) raises the same issue. His interpretation in chapter 4 ("Polyphony and Plot") depends on equating Moses's song with the Torah in its entirety, an interpretation very likely presupposed by the Sifre, but stated explicitly only elsewhere. To summarize, Steven Fraade has written an extremely rich and important book. Occasionally, the data he cites admits of alternative interpretations, but the textual analyses which comprise the bulk of the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 197 volume are original, insightful, and carefully researched. Hopefully, this gifted exegete will apply his interpretive techniques to other parts of the Sifre and other ancient rabbinic texts, and will further refine his valuable interpretive techniques.
