<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER IN HEBREW SCRIPTURES By MOSHE GREENBERG Hebrew University of Jerusalem Prophetic intercessory prayer was vividly described some years ago by Yochanan Muffs in an essay that collected and interrelated the wrestlings with God that characterize prophetic prayer from Moses through Samuel to Jeremiah. Earlier, Sheldon Blank studied "the Promethean element in Biblical prayer," an allusion to the independent, even defiant stance taken by certain biblical pray-ers.' To modern Western man, this sort of prayer best corresponds to his ideal image of himself: autonomous, self-assertive, courageous, ready to stand on a principle even against God. However, it would be a mistake to forget the special status of such intercessors within their faith-communities and infer from their conduct a model for the com- mon man. They are "men of God," persons standing in a particularly inti- mate relation to God as a result of election or prolonged devotion to him; of Honi the circle-maker-a later representative of this class-it was cen- soriously said that he was like a child who cajoles his father. Any other man presuming to act that way-the same censor concluded-would de- 1.

Now, if I have truly gained your favor, pray let me know your ways . . .' " (Exod. 33:12 f.); and again, "If I have gained your favor, O Lord, pray let the LORD go in our midst ..." (34:9). These heroes of faith have achieved a standing with God that ordinary mortals do not enjoy. They bank on their closeness to God and their consciousness of being in his good graces-and upon their utter self- lessness, their readiness to sacrifice all, themselves included, upon the altar of faith. Having nothing they are not prepared to lose, they can be reckless. The situation of the ordinary mortal is quite different. With neither a vocation to God's service nor the heroism of these figures of legend, self- assertiveness and autonomy in relation to God would be considered pre- sumptuous. In fact, the attitude of the common worshiper was far removed from the Promethean; the storming of heaven by prophets hardly served as a model for the ordinary (or even the extraordinary) pious Israelite. There are several avenues to understanding the meaning of worship to the people of biblical times. The terms denoting acts of worship may be studied, noting whether they are exclusively used with respect to God-man relations, or whether they denote social relations too; whether, again, they have levels of refinement, e.g., from plain to metaphoric use. In the case of prayer, the literary records of prayer are sources of the first importance for revealing the mind and the motives of pray-ers. Polemics against the people's worship are another indication of meaning, with the advantage of disclosing nonstandard, vulgar conceptions otherwise missing from the canonical material. It must be borne in mind, however, that polemists tend to exaggerate or distort the object of their fulminations. In the following inquiry, something of all these avenues will be taken. First we shall examine the term 'abad 'et YHWH, "to serve the LORD." Then we shall study some biblical critiques of modes of worship, following them to their conclusions. As we seek to ascertain the attitude of mind of certain biblical pray-ers, we shall be interested to see wherein they differ from childish, unreflecting conceptions. Ultimately, our inquiry will bear 2.

Prayer is a form of service of God.3 This is indicated by the parallelism in such passages as Job 21:15: What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what does it profit us that we pray to him? or Isaiah 44:17: ... he bows to [his idol] and prostrates himself before it; he prays to it, saying, "Save me for you are my God!" In the future, God will give the nations a "purified speech," So that all of them may call upon the name of the LORD,' And serve him unanimously. (Zeph. 3:9) The chief form of divine service in Scripture is the sacrificial cult, but prayer of petition and praise is frequently associated with it. Samuel's 3. The most comprehensive and profound study of the phenomena of prayer is still Friedrich Heiler's Prayer: A Study in the History and Psychology of Religion (Lon- don, New York, and Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1932), translated and edited [and shortened] from the German by S. McComb with the assistance of J. E. Park. My understanding of and approach to the biblical material has been deeply affected by Heiler's study. A brief survey of the biblical concept of worship is J. Licht's entry, 'abodat 'elohim ("service of God") in Ensiqlopedia Miqra'it 6 (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1971), 37-39; Licht does not include prayer under this rubric. A painstakingly thorough analysis of biblical prayer outside the psalms and proph- ets is to be found in A. Wendel, Das freie Laiengebet im vorexilischen Israel (Leipzig: Pfeiffer, 1932); illuminating remarks on biblical prayer in general, in Y. Kaufman, Toledot Ha-emunah Ha-yisre'elit II/2 (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1945), 499-506 (abridged in The Religion of Israel [Chicago, 1960], 309-311). In the translation of biblical passages, I have followed, in the psalms, the new Jewish Publication Society version (Philadelphia, 1972); elsewhere The Old Testa- ment: An American Translation, ed. J. M. Powis Smith (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1927), has served as a guide. 4. "To call upon the name of the LORD" (qara belem YHWH), while properly only the invocation and start of prayer-and as such originally belonging to polythe- ism, where it is necessary at the outset of prayer to single out by name the deity addressed-is used here as a synonym of prayer; cf. 1 Kings 18:24 ff. In a striking monotheistic skewing of the original sense, the phrase is given the meaning "proclaim the name LORD" = proclaim the attributes to be invoked in prayer in Exodus 33:19; 34:5 (so rendered in the new Jewish Publication Society version of the Torah [2d ed., 1967] ).</page><page sequence="4">60 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER cry to God for help from the Philistines follows a sacrifice (1 Sam. 7:9); Solomon's praises and petition at the inauguration of the temple precede a sacrifice (1 Kings 8:62). Sacrifice and prayer are linked closely in the private worship of Hannah at Shiloh (1 Sam. 1). So closely were the two interrelated that the late prophet whose message is contained in the latter part of the book of Isaiah could exchange them: I will bring them to my holy mountain, And will make them joyful in my house of prayer; Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be welcome upon my altar, For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples. (Isa. 56:7) Moreover, the psalmist could expressly equate the two: Take my prayer as an offering of incense, My upraised hands as an evening sacrifice. (141:2) No less than the sacrificial cult might prayer too be regarded as a divine commandment, a duty ordained by God. This is the case not only with the exiles, addressed by God in Jeremiah 29:12 thus: You shall call me, and go and pray to me, and I will listen to you... It is also the demand of God in Psalm 50:15: "Call upon me in time of trouble." In ancient Mesopotamia, too, prayer was considered on the same foot- ing as the sacrificial cult. The sufferer in the composition "I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom" describes his piety in these terms: For myself, I gave attention to supplication and prayer; To me prayer was discretion, sacrifice my rule. (II 23 f.) We are entitled, therefore, to start our inquiry into the character of prayer by examining the character of divine service in general in Hebrew Scrip- ture. The attitude of one praying to God and that of one sacrificing to him were as closely linked as the phenomena themselves. A remark on the method to be pursued in this inquiry is here in order. Our aim is to discover the highest expressions of the scriptural understand- ing of prayer, those peaks arrived at through insight and reflection which stand out as the spiritual achievements of the biblical age in ancient Israel. The criterion is the degree of removal from simple anthropopathism- naive, unreflecting ascription to God of human sentiments and the conse-</page><page sequence="5">MOSHE GREENBERG 61 quent conception of his service in terms of that done for a human being. That ancient Israel harbored such conceptions is a certainty, on the basis both of polemic against them and their appearance even in the canonical literature. Thus, for example, the do ut des of Malachi 3:10: Bring the whole tithe into the treasury That there may be food in my house, And test me now therein, says the LORD of hosts, Whether I do not then open the windows of heaven And pour out for you blessing without limit. That level of religion is here taken for granted, and will not be considered save as a background for inquiry into the higher levels. The focus on the peaks carries further the method of G. F. Moore in his classic History of Religions, as set forth in the preface to the second volume: In this . . . volume it is primarily the religion of intelligent and religious men that is described. . . . Such men are always the minority, but they are the true representatives of their religion in any age, teachers and examples to their fellows. No religion has ever succeeded in bringing all of its adherents to its standards of right living, or within sight of its intellectual and spiritual ideals; and in the highest religions the gulf between the intellectual and moral lead- ers and the superstitious and depraved sediment of society is widest. But it is not from ignorance and superstition that anything can be learned about a religion; at that end they are all alike. (xi) Our standard is even more selective; it is the farthest limit to which spiritual refinement developed the germinal conceptions whose gross concretiza- tions are common to all religion. The sources for such peaks are, generally speaking, in the later litera- ture, from the late monarchy onward and in the Psalms. But it is not to be expected that an evolution can always be traced within these sources, from earlier crude concepts to later refined ones. Both kinds may appear in the same source; our task will be to set forth the ideational relation of the less to the more refined concept, rather than their historical interrela- tion. We cannot arrange the material in a historical sequence; we can ar- range it in an ideational climax. The Sumero-Babylonian conception of service of the gods, well defined and well attested as it is, can serve as a foil to set off its scriptural counter- part. "[The Sumerian thinkers]," writes S. N. Kramer, "were firmly con- vinced that man was fashioned of clay and created for one purpose only: to</page><page sequence="6">62 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER serve the gods by supplying them with food, drink, and shelter so that they might have full leisure for their divine activities." 6 In the various Meso- potamian cosmogonies, this thought is clearly expressed. In Enuma Elish, the cosmogonic paean to Marduk, the hero declares his purpose to create man. Upon him shall the service of the gods be imposed That they may be at rest. (vi 8) A later, bilingual cosmogony goes into greater detail. After the creation of heaven and earth, the gods contemplate the creation of man: In Uzumua, the bond of heaven and earth, Let us slay (two) Lamga gods. With their blood let us create mankind. The service of the gods be their portion, For all times To maintain the boundary ditch, To place the hoe and the basket Into their hands For the dwelling of the great gods... To mark off field from field... To raise plants in abundance... To increase the abundance in the land, To celebrate the festivals of the gods, To pour out cold water In the great house of the gods, which is fit to be an exalted sanctuary ..6 It is a question whether this idea was always accepted with complacency. Kramer believes it was: "Convinced beyond all need of argument that man was created by the gods solely for their benefit and leisure, the Sumerians accepted their dependent status just as they accepted the divine decision that death was man's lot and that only the gods were immortal." However, Mesopotamian myths telling of the loss of immortality (or eternal youth) suggest that the latter decision was not accepted without protest." Be that as it may, this conception of the purpose of man's crea- tion placed the relation of gods and men on a thoroughly instrumental foot- 5. S. N.

Benefit accrued to the gods from men-a circumstance that suggested a motive for the gods to be of benefit to men as well. A letter of a man to his personal god puts the matter bluntly: To the god, my father, say: So says Apiladad, your servant: Why have you neglected me? Who will give you another Who is toward you like me?" The ultimate conclusion of this conception is drawn in the eighth stanza of the "Dialogue of Master and Servant," in which the pros and cons of service to the gods are argued. The piece represents the dissolution of the Babylonian world of values. "Slave, oblige me!" "Yes, yes, my lord!" "Forthwith fetch and hand me water for my hands! I will offer a sacrifice to my god!" "Offer, my lord, offer! The man who offers a sacrifice to his god, his heart is glad; He makes investment upon investment." "No, slave, I will not, in truth, offer a sacrifice to my god!" "Do not, my lord, do not! Thou mightst accustom the god to follow thee like a dog, Asking of thee either 'my due!' or 'Didst thou not ask?' or anything else." 10 9. Text and French translation in J.

Cooper's detailed review in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 93 (1973), 581-585 (itself of great interest) indicates that it is a valuable contribution to the understanding of the question here touched upon only cursorily.</page><page sequence="8">64 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER The mutual alienation that results from instrumental relationships be- tween persons here attains its perfect expression; both the sacrificer and the gods are means for each other's ends. Each party utilizes the other, wields control over and needs the other at the same time. Reverence, awe, even affection can and did arise from such a relationship; it is less easy, however, to conceive of selfless devotion, of longing for everlasting com- munion with the god as its fruit. The initial impression of a survey of the term 'abad 'et YHWH, "to serve the LORD," is of parallelism to the concept of serving human rulers. Because you would not serve the LORD your God joyously and will- ingly in the abundance of everything, you shall serve your enemies ... in hunger, thirst, nakedness and want of everything; and he shall put an iron yoke on your neck. (Deut. 28:47 f.) I will break the yoke off their neck... and they shall serve aliens no more, but shall serve the LORD their God, and David, their King, whom I will raise up for them. (Jer. 30:8 f.) Nevertheless, they shall be [Shishak's] servants, that they may know my service from the service of the kingdoms of the earth. (2 Chron. 12:8) The concepts being parallel, examination of the ideational content of the service of human rulers can help us to understand that of the service of God. An expression like "The nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and will serve him" (Jer. 27:11) shows that at bottom it is compliant acceptance of rule and lordship, analogous to the subjugation of an ox to its master. The contrary is expressed by "He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him" (2 Kings 18:7). Service to a human ruler is a political concept-subjection ex- pressed by recognition of authority and loyal obedience. This is by no means a negative concept; there is a form of subjection affirmed by the Bible: subjection to a legitimate king. The king's right to authority and obedience is grounded, in the Bible, on a signal benefaction, particularly rescue from oppression, that he per- formed for his fellowmen. Jotham condemned the Shechemites' com- plicity in the overthrow of Gideon's family, "seeing that my father fought for you . . . and rescued you from the hands of Midian" (Jud. 9:16 f.). God raised Saul to kingship to "deliver my people from the hand of the</page><page sequence="9">MOSHE GREENBERG 65 Philistines" (1 Sam. 9:16); the people anointed him after he saved Jabesh Gilead from shameful subjection to the Ammonite king (11:14 f.). David's legitimacy was acknowledged by the people after Absalom's death, when they recalled that "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he freed us from the power of the Philistines" (2 Sam. 19:10). A king's demand of loyal obedience is justified by his benefactions to his subjects and his preserving justice among them. These may properly be de- manded of him, as in Jeremiah's admonition: Hear the word of the LORD, O house of David! ... Morning by morning give righteous judgment, And deliver the spoiled from the hand of the oppressor. (21:11 f.) The righteous attributes of the king are the basis of his rule: Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; Rightly has God, your God, chosen to anoint you With oil of gladness over all your peers. (Ps. 45:7 f.) O God, endow the king with your judgments, The king's son with your righteousness; That he judge your people rightly, Your lowly ones, justly... Let him champion the lowly among the people, Deliver the needy folk, and crush those who wrong them... Let all kings bow to him, And all nations serve him. For he saves the needy who cry out, The lowly who have no helper. He cares about the wretched needy, He brings the needy deliverance. He redeems them from fraud and lawlessness; The shedding of their blood weighs heavily upon him. (Ps. 72:1 f., 4, 11 iff.) The king's right to the loyalty of his subjects and their obligation to render it are thus based on his positive attributes: he is a good shepherd, a righ- teous judge, a provider and protector. Therefore submission to his rule is but the due of gratitude he deserves. The effectiveness of this conception is manifest in the condition the northern tribes made for accepting Rehoboam as their king: "Now lighten the galling service of your father and the bur- densome yoke he laid upon us and we will serve you" (1 Kings 12:4).</page><page sequence="10">66 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER Complete the thought: and if you do not show fairness and fail to con- sider our welfare, we will not serve you! The very same bundle of conceptions belongs to the service of God. Consider, first, the Deuteronomic verb chains: To stand in awe of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, love him, serve [him] with all your mind and heart, and keep the com- mands of the LORD. (Deut. 10:12) It is the LORD your God whom you must follow; of him you must stand in awe; his commands you must keep; his injunctions you must heed; him you must serve; and to him you must hold fast. (13:5) Service of God is thus devotion to him in loyal obedience. The national sin is defined as exchanging one sovereign for another; e.g., "They served the Baals . . . abandoning the LORD and not serving him" (Jud. 10:6). The basis of the requirement to serve God is the deliverance and benefac- tions Israel experienced from him. The people artlessly cry to him, "Save us from the hand of our enemy and we will serve you" (I Sam. 12:10). God's privilege of demanding Israel's service flows from his freeing them from Egypt and his providence for and protection of them since then: "I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; you have experienced no God but me, and have had no deliverer except me" (Hos. 13:4).1 All the beneficient attributes of the king are found in him: 11. In spite of the intensive study that has been devoted to the affinities of the covenant between Israel and its God with ancient Near Eastern treaties-and they are important and extensive-the older suggestion that the "royal covenant" establish- ing the right of a monarch to rule over a given community is the immediate model of Israel's national covenant with God remains attractive (see, e.g., M. Buber, Moses [Oxford: East and West, 1947], 103). Of David it is specifically related that upon the recognition by the elders of Israel of his right to reign over them, he "made a covenant for them in Hebron before the LORD" whereupon they anointed him king (2 Sam. 5:1-3). As in the case of Saul's anointing by the people (1 Sam. 11:14 f.), acknowledgment of a right to rule is based on some record of service or benefaction to the people. The considerable parallelism between king-subject and God-Israel relationships suggests that the "royal covenant" offered biblical thinkers the model most ready to hand of the establishment of an individual as ruler of an already existent ethnopolity. It has been observed that only in later literature (notably Deu- teronomy) does the full treaty form, as it is known from ancient international vassal treaties, appear with respect to Israel's covenant with God; this may well reflect a gradual literary assimilation of vassal treaties with which biblical writers of the Assyrian period came to be familiar through the subjugation of Israel and Judah to Assyria. The earlier covenant documents (e.g., the Decalogue; "the Book of the Covenant") lack essential features of the later treaty form (e.g., blessings and curses); perhaps this is due to their following a different model--the "royal covenant,"</page><page sequence="11">MOSHE GREENBERG 67 The LORD executes righteous acts And judgments for all who are wronged. (Ps. 103:6) The LORD watches over the stranger; He gives courage to the orphan and widow. (146:9) He saves the poor from one stronger than he; The poor and the needy from his despoiler. (35:10) Therefore serving him is but recognition of a debt of gratitude, and for- saking him is at once faithlessness and foolishness. Be aghast, O heavens, at this... For my people have committed two wrongs: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, To hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. (Jer. 2:12 f.) Yet Israel's experience of God contained another element that lent the relation between them a more sublime character. Some passages in the Pentateuch ascribe the deliverance from Egypt to God's compassion and his mindfulness of his covenant with the fathers (Exod. 2:24; 3:7 ff.). But Deu- teronomy and related passages in Hosea ascribe it to God's love of Israel. "When Israel was a youth," says Hosea, "I loved him . . . I drew him with ropes of love" (11:1, 4); in the future, "I will love them as a freewill offering" (14:5), but at present "I will not continue to love them" (9:15). Deuteronomy speaks in a similar vein: The LORD set his heart on your fathers to love your fathers and choose their descendants, even you . . . (10:15) Not because you were greater than any other people did the LORD set his heart on you and choose you . .. but because the LORD loved you, and would keep the oath he swore to your fathers. (7:7 f.) The LORD your God turned [Balaam's] curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loved you. (23:6) From there, the conception passed to Jeremiah ("I have loved you ever- lastingly, therefore I tendered you loving kindness" [31:2]), to the (post) exilic Isaiah ("By his love and his pity he redeemed them" [63:9]), and whose form we do not know, but whose existence is attested at least for David. The essential features of the royal covenant were presumbably the acknowledgment of the right of the king to rule on the basis of prior merit, and the obligation of the people to be loyal subjects to him.</page><page sequence="12">68 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER to Malachi ("I love you, says the LORD" [1:2]). The perception of God's acts in Israel as the fruits of love opened the way to lending the service of God the quality of returned love. It has been pointed out by W. Moranl2 that the commandment of loving God in Deuteronomy is analogous to the demand of loyalty made in similar language in ancient Near Eastern vassal treaties. But M. Weinfeld has rightly observed'3 that the context of Deuteronomy indicates a sentiment more refined than political loyalty. God's demand "to stand in awe of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, love him, serve him with all your heart and mind, and keep his com- mands" stands in the context of the statement that "the LORD set his heart on your fathers to love them" (Deut. 10:12, 15). Surely there is a connection between these two loves. At its peak, the concept of serving God includes a constant mental atti- tude, a permanent awareness of God that is embodied, among other ways, in one's moral character: You shall again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, Between him who serves God and him who does not. (Mal. 3:18) The parallelism indicates that to serve God is not merely to perform at given times certain rites honoring God, but to exhibit service and submission by one's moral character. Equally interesting is a passage showing that awe of God is a state of mind desired by God's servants; Nehemiah 1:11 speaks of "your servants who desire to stand in awe of your name." The servant of God wants the steady consciousness of God's presence; he longs to feel the awe of God. A delicate statement of the meaning of serving God is found in Psalm 123: As the eyes of slaves follow their master's hand, As the eyes of a slave-girl follow the hand of her mistress, So our eyes are toward the LORD our God, Waiting for his favor... By concentrating upon the eyes, the poet focuses the figure of master-slave upon its to him essential aspect: the utter dependence that the slave feels toward his master. Nothing is left of the usefulness of the slave 12. W. L. Moran, "The Ancient Near Eastern Background of the Love of God in Deuteronomy," Catholic Biblical Quarterly, 25 (1963), 77-87. 13. M.

All is now the servant's dependence and waiting upon the master. That is the purified figure of the human servant of God: not one who ministers to him, but the dependent one, waiting for his favor. What are the practical expressions of service? Bowing prostrate ("outstretching of hands and feet"),4 the plainest self- diminution and degradation, is the typical bodily attitude of service, whether to man or God. Isaac foretells for Jacob that "Peoples shall serve you, nations bow prostrate before you" (Gen. 27:29). Similar in import is the downcast head (as its opposite, the upraised head, symbolizes self- assertion and defiance [e.g., Ps. 83:2]); the pious complain: It is vain to serve God, and what have we gained from keeping his charge, And from going about with bowed head before the LORD of hosts? (Mal. 3:14) The posture bespeaks an attitude of humble subjection and self-depre- ciation. Offering tribute is another characteristic act of service to a ruler. In the case of human rulers, tribute regularly served to maintain the ruler's household and his administrative establishment. Israel's service of Eglon, king of Moab, entailed a tribute so large it required a troop of carriers (Jud. 3:14-18). The tribute that came in annually to Solomon went to sup- port an extensive court and royal officialdom (1 Kings 5:1 ft.; 10:24 f.). The heavy imposts paid by the Judeans to the king of Persia are called his "service" in Nehemiah 5:18. But not every tribute to a ruler was a contri- bution to upkeep. There was also the tribute that expressed submission only, characterized by dispensability. Joseph's brothers are instructed by Jacob to bring a tribute to the Egyptian viceroy--choice confections of the land of Canaan (Gen. 43:11 f.). Clearly, the viceroy did not need these gifts to maintain himself; they were but tokens of acknowledgment of his power over the brothers. Service of God too included offerings made to him, as we learn from such passages as "to perform the service of the LORD before him by our burnt offerings, sacrifices and peace-offerings" (Josh. 22:27), or by Ab- salom's vow "to serve the LORD" in Hebron (2 Sam. 15:8), by which 14.

Berakot 34b.</page><page sequence="14">70 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER a sacrifice is intended. That such offerings were not God's upkeep must have been clear to the Israelite from both narrative tradition and law. The well-known Exodus story stated expressly that God was not worshiped in sacrifice during the Egyptian sojourn (Exod. 8:21 ff.); Amos assumes it to be common knowledge that there was no regular sacrificial worship during the desert wandering (Amos 5:25). Hosea's threat of exile ex- plicitly enumerates the various items comprising the entire temple worship that will cease-clearly implying its dispensability to God (Hos. 9:3 ff.). The regular daily offering prescribed in the priestly law is much too small to have suggested to anyone that it was God's daily maintenance (a yearling lamb in the morning and one other at evening [Num. 28:3 ff.]); later mid- rash legitimately combined this datum with the rhetorical questions of Psalm 50:13 ("Do I eat the flesh of bulls?. .. ") in this extrapolation: "Does he experience hunger? (cf. Ps. 50:12). And he goes on to say, 'If I should experience hunger, is the lamb that you offer at morning and the lamb at evening enough for me?'" (Tosefta Menahot 7:6). More will be said concerning Psalm 50 below, but enough has been said here to warrant the conclusion that in the matter of tribute offerings, only a partial symmetry exists between the conception relative to human rulers and the conception relative to God. Offerings to human rulers may be for main- tenance or for expressing submission; offerings to God are never more than tokens of submission. There is, finally, the service of God in his sanctuary performed by the temple personnel. J. Milgrom has traced the distribution of the several meanings of 'aboda in cultic contexts, from its basic sense of labor to that of cult-service.'5 This sort of service lies outside our field of inquiry, since it belongs entirely to the realm of the temple rites performed by priests, Levites, and other temple servants. In passing, however, we note that the daily praise of God in song is included in the levitical service of the temple (e.g., 1 Chron. 23:30; cf. vs. 28). Thus far, practical expressions of service common to God and man have been surveyed. There are forms of service peculiar to God alone, and these are characterized by the absence of any idea of benefit to the recipient, God; on the contrary, they all answer needs of the server. The annual commemoration of God's liberation of Israel from Egypt is called a service: 15. J. Milgrom, Studies in Levitical Terminology, 1: The Encroacher and the Levite; The Term cAboda (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970), 60 fif.</page><page sequence="15">MOSHE GREENBERG 71 S.. You must observe this service. When your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?' you shall say, 'It is the passover- sacrifice to the LORD... (Exod. 12:25 ff.) When the LORD brings you into the land . . . you must hold this service in this month... (13:5) Whatever the primary significance of the passover sacrifice (evidently apotropaic), the text makes it clear that its annual repetition has a purely commemorative function, recalling to later generations the wondrous bene- factions of God to Israel. Its aim was to arouse in later times the senti- ments of gratitude and devoted loyalty to God. Another form of service peculiarly offered to God is the joyous singing of his praises.'" It was noted above that the levitical daily praise-singing is called a service; similarily in Psalm 100: Serve the LORD in gladness; Come into his presence with shouts of joy ... Enter his gates with praise; Praise him; bless his name! Evaluation of the purpose of praise of God in the psalms must take ac- count of C. Westermann's observation' that, in contrast to the practice of extrabiblical ancient Near Eastern hymnody, biblical praise does not pre- cede petition; that is, it is not a means of conciliating and appeasing the deity prior to laying a request before him. In Hebrew Scripture, the praise of God forms a class of hymns unto itself, with no petitional element. When it enters into petitions it is as a foretaste of the acknowledgment of God's help to be made after the petition is granted, or (as will be enlarged upon later) as a ground of hope amidst distress. In this respect, the psalms differ notably from prayers embedded in the 16. Psalm 45, in which the praises of a king are sung incidentally to celebrating his marriage, is alone of its type. How different it is from a hymn of praise to kings properly speaking can be seen from comparison with the Sumerian examples adduced in A. Falkenstein and W. von Soden, Sumerische und Akkadische Hymnen und Ge- bete (Ziirich/Stuttgart: Artemis, 1953), 115 ff., or the Egyptian examples in W. K. Simpson, ed., The Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, and Poetry (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972), 279 ff. Although no examples of such praises to a king exist from ancient Israel, one must be cautious about drawing conclusions from silence. Had not Psalm 45:18 explicitly been found in a royal context, who would have guessed that its reference was to an earthly king? 17. C. Westermann, The Praise of God in the Psalms, trans, by K. R. Crim (London: Epworth, 1966), 37, 42, 46 f.</page><page sequence="16">72 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER narratives. The latter often preface petition by a laudatory epithet or a more or less extensive statement of praise (e.g., 2 Sam. 7:22 ff.; 1 Kings 8:23 f.; 2 Kings 19:15). The later Jewish rule concerning petitions- "One should always set forth the praise of God first, then pray (i.e., make petition)" [Berakot 32a]-is modeled explicitly upon Moses' entreaty in Deuteronomy 3:24: "O Lord, GOD. You let your servant see the first works of your greatness and your mighty hand-you whose powerful deeds no god in heaven or on earth can equal! Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan. ...." The motive of such praise (before it became mere convention) is transparent and identical with its pagan hymnal correspondents. But since this collocation of praise- petition does not appear in the psalms, there is room to inquire whether the motive of psalmic praise may not (at least at times) be different. It would indeed appear to be so. A prime motive of praise, given repeatedly in the psalms, is the sheer joy experienced in God's benefactions. For the psalmist, the song of praise is the necessary expression of his overflowing feeling: It is good to praise the LORD, To sing hymns to your name, O Most High... For you have gladdened me by your deeds.... I shout for joy at your handiwork. How great are your works, O LORD, How very subtle your designs! (92:2 f., 5 f.) Bless the LORD, O my soul. And do not forget all his bounties. (103:2) So conjoined are the experience of God's goodness and the outburst of acknowledging praise that even inanimate creation is imagined as respond- ing to God's blessing in this way: You crown the year with your bounty; Fatness is distilled in your paths; The pasture lands distill it; The hills are girded with joy. The meadows are clothed with flocks, The valleys mantled with grain; They raise a shout, they break into song... (65:12 ff.) Since heightened consciousness of God's presence and work in the world characterizes spiritual men, not a few of the psalmists assert a resolve</page><page sequence="17">MOSHE GREENBERG 73 constantly to praise God; for them, to live is to acknowledge God's benefactions: I bless the LORD at all times; Praise of him is ever in my mouth. (34:2) I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; All my life I will chant hymns to my God. (104:33) Psalm 71 is singularly filled with such expressions: I sing your praises always, My mouth is full of praise to you, Glorifying you all day long... My mouth tells of your beneficence, Of your deliverance all day long... I come with praise of your mighty acts... I celebrate your beneficence, yours alone. You have taught me, God, from my youth, Until now I have proclaimed your wondrous deeds; And even in hoary old age do not forsake me, God, Until I proclaim your strength to the next generation, Your mighty acts to all who are to come .... All day long my tongue shall recite your beneficent acts ... These sentiments are of a piece with assertions made elsewhere of a de- sire to dwell forever in the house of God (Pss. 23; 29; 61)-i.e., to be a permanent temple-servant. They bespeak a soul so filled with an awareness of God as to be unwilling to sever communion with him for even a mo- ment. We are reminded of the postbiblical image of the heavenly beings whose eternal occupation is to sing hymns to God: And in that place my eyes saw the Elect one ... And all the righteous and elect before him shall be strong as fiery lights, and their mouths shall be full of blessing, and their lips extol the name of the Lord of Spirits ... And here my eyes saw all those who sleep not: they stand before him and say, Blessed be thou and blessed be the name of the Lord forever and ever . . . (1 Enoch 39:6, 7, 13 f.) Praise of God has here reached the farthest remove from flattery and ap- peasement. As in the psalms cited above (and others not cited), it is the blissful experience of God that motivates praise, not the anxiety of need. In the case of postbiblical imagery, the angelic status of the praisers makes it plain that they stand in no need, that their praise is therefore without</page><page sequence="18">74 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER ulterior motive. The basis of that imagery, however, must be some human experience; the disinterested praise of the psalmists, the outpouring of their joy and wonder at God's deeds, supplies the antecedent human model of the later imagery. Another feature that distinguishes biblical songs of praise from their Babylonian and Egyptian counterparts (in other respects strikingly similar) is the large number of summonses to praise that occur in them. Doubtless this is connected with the fact that Israel's praises were congregational, sung by lay celebrants, not only by professional temple singers (cf., e.g., Ps. 42:5, ". .. how I walked with crowd, moved with them, the festive throng, to the house of God with joyous shouts of praise"). But that can- not by itself explain why out of fifty-three hymns and praise-songs of the community, twenty-eight contain a summons, addressed to the hearers, to praise, sing, shout for joy, chant hymns, raise a shout, clap hands, or bless. Even four of the fifteen praises of the individual contain such exhortations. What is the meaning of this? If it were merely a matter of flattery, we can- not suppose Israelite singers more. adept at this than Babylonian or Egyp- tian; why then is the summons to praise not found outside Israel? In his discerning Reflections on the Psalms, C. S. Lewis offers this in- terpretation of the praises to God in the psalms in general, and of the sum- mons in particular: ... all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise.... The world rings with praise-lovers praising their mistresses, readers their fa- vorite poet, walkers praising the countryside .... Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible .... Just as men spontaneously praise whatever they value, so they spontaneously urge us to join them in praising it: "Isn't she lovely? Wasn't it glorious? Don't you think that magnificent?" The Psalmists in telling everyone to praise God are doing what all men do when they speak of what they care about. (94 f.) This seems to touch the root of the matter, as it accords with the en- thusiasm otherwise in evidence in the songs of praise. The Babylonian and Egyptian hymns, showing more deliberation and a greater subservience to form, lack the summons. Its presence in scriptural praises bespeaks the emotion aroused in the authors through consciousness of the divine bene- factions. The service of praise has thus the quality of a release of human emotion, an answer to man's need of giving expression to powerful feelings of gratitude, joy, and wonder.</page><page sequence="19">MOSHE GREENBERG 75 With this we conclude our inquiry into the biblical conception of the service of God. In its biblical refinement, the master-servant figure under- went an essential change: the mutuality of the full-blooded image, in which each party both benefits and derives benefit materially from the other has been transformed: God is master only in that he sets the terms of his servants' existence; man is servant only in that he is wholly dependent upon God. But man's material uselessness to God does not mean that God is indifferent to man's attitude toward him. On the contrary, God commands that man worship him, that he recognize his creaturehood and subjection and that he acknowledge God's goodness. This service of God is a value because it has been commanded by him, because it is his pleasure (just as every biblical value derives ultimately from the divine will). Thus, while the material basis of the value of divine service is denied, its spiritual basis is not: man is a concern of God and man's happiness is God's pleasure; hence the condition of his happiness-recognition that he is God's crea- ture-is a divine desire, and command.' Much can be learned about the refinement of the conception of the service of God from the critiques directed against current practice in the prophetic and nonprophetic literature. The prophetic critique of Israel's worship has often been dealt with, and shall not, therefore, be reviewed here.1 Its viewpoint is external to the world of worship; it condemns the entire range of Israel's cultic activity, without discriminating between sacrifice and prayer, or between petition and praise-the whole stands under the prophetic judgment that the wor- ship of villains is an abomination to the Lord. Such wholesale rejection, reaching its climax in Micah 6:6-8, where God's requirement of man is summed up entirely in moral terms, cannot have had much of an effect on 18. The observation that the unreined pursuit of human fancies, the desire to carry out whatever can be imagined, to realize to the utmost one's capabilities-that these lead to human self-destruction-underlies both the Garden of Eden and the Tower of Babel stories. Recognition of creatureliness, of subservience to God, ex- pressed through a curb upon one's potential activities, is portrayed in these stories as a condition of man's happiness (through showing how their absence led to mis- fortune). What is in Greece regarded as the jealousy of the gods is in Hebrew Scrip- ture considered simply as the bounds and conditions of human happiness. See my brief note "On the Meaning of the Garden of Eden Story in Genesis," (Hebrew), Shedemot, 33 (Spring 5729 [1969] ), 10 f. 19.

In truth, it is difficult to find prophetic influence on the evolution of sensibility and discrimination in this area; what has been pointed to as such 2o can better be accounted for by internal growth within the institutions of worship. A remarkable reflex of such internal growth is Psalm 50, a product of critical reflection by one close to the forms of worship. The psalm depicts God's judgment upon two types of worshipers: first, the sacrificer who imagines that he is doing something for God; second, the "reciter of his laws" whose deeds contradict his text. We shall give attention to the reproof directed toward the sacrificer, for here we find a hierarchy of values within the forms of divine service. God, the LORD God spoke And summoned the world from east to west. From Zion, perfect in beauty God appeared ... He summoned the heavens above, And the earth for the trial of his people. "Bring in my devotees, who made a covenant with me over sacrifice!" Then the heavens proclaimed his righteousness, For he is a God who judges. "Pay heed, my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will arraign you. I am God, your God. I censure you not for your sacrifices, And your burnt offerings made to me daily; I claim no bull from your estate, No he-goats from your pens. For mine is every animal of the forest, The beasts on a thousand mountains. I know every bird of the mountains, The creatures of the field are subject to me. Were I hungry, I would not tell you, For mine is the world and all it holds. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of he-goats? 20. H. Gunkel, J.

Call upon me in time of trouble; I will rescue you and you shall honor me." (Ps. 50: 1-15) The error of the sacrificer is inferable from the reproof. This is the gist of it: I do not reprove you for slackness in offering the daily animal sacri- fices, since all living things are, after all, mine. Even if I hungered, then, I should not look to you for relief. But really, do I eat or drink? Thus far, God has made his points negatively or in rhetorical questions. He addresses those who have "made a covenant with him over sacrifice" (ambiguous: a covenant ratified by / concerned with sacrifice), apparently an ironic title for worshipers whose zeal in making the regular whole and peace offer- ings was sustained by the notion that in so doing they were doing some- thing for God. Having scolded them more in irony and by indirection than by straightforward condemnation, God turns to exhortation, in which it emerges that what he intends is not a blanket polemic against sacrifice: Sacrifice a thank offering to God, And pay your vows to the Most High... The next verse, though later in place, is prior in time: Call upon me in time of trouble; I will rescue you and you shall honor me... The correct temporal order is given, e.g., in Psalm 66:13 f. I enter your house with burnt offering; I pay my vows to you; Vows that my lips pronounced, That my mouth uttered in my distress ... Or in Job 22:27, "Pray to him and he will listen to you, so you shall pay your vows." The thank offering was an occasion for honoring God in that it gave an opportunity to testify publicly to his providential care: Because of you I offer praise in the great congregation; I pay my vows in the presence of his worshipers. Let the lowly eat [viz., of the thank offering] and be satisfied... (Ps. 22:26 f.) I will sacrifice a thank offering to you... I will pay my vows to the LORD In the presence of all his people, In the courts of the house of the LORD ... (116:17 f.)</page><page sequence="22">78 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER In our Psalm 50, the reprover contrasts "your sacrifices and burnt offerings made to me daily"-which he rejects-with the thank offering-which he commands. He rejects the former with a rhetoric aimed against the idea that the sacrificer gives God something he lacks or needs. He sharpens, and perhaps exaggerates polemically, a notion (vague and indeterminate as it might have been) that the daily, regular cult somehow worked to God's benefit. Over against that, the reprover sets the thank offering as an un- alloyed honoring of God. How is that? Through the offerer's publishing abroad, incidental to his sacrifice, how he called upon God in distress and how God heard and delivered him. In the votive thank offering the essence of honoring God-and serving him-is realized: the acknowledgment that one is dependent upon God, that one needs him. The preferred service is that which expresses man's dependence and need for God in unalloyed form. Biblical religion managed to embody this idea even by means of sacrifice. In this psalm, the pagan vestige that adhered to the sacrificial worship-the popular evaluation of the regular cult as doing something for God-was overcome from within the system. The idea of service was purified from inside by discriminating one type of sacrifice from another, in no way like the external, wholesale condemnation of all cult forms by the prophets. A higher stage of refinement was the preference of the recital of God's saving act to the thank offering. C. Westermann has noted that the under- taking to recite the saving acts of the deity is a motif common to the prayers of Israel, Egypt, and Mesopotamia.21 In Israel the vow to bring a thank offering must have implied an accompanying recital of God's benefaction. Only so can we understand the formulation of the undertaking as it ap- pears, e.g., in Psalm 27:6: I will sacrifice in his tent with shouts of joy, Singing and chanting a hymn to the LORD. or in 54:8: Then I will offer you a free-will sacrifice; I will acknowledge that your name, LORD, is good. 21.

Ginsberg, "Psalms and Inscriptions of Petition and Acknowledgment," Louis Ginzberg Jubilee Volume, English Section (New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1945), 159 ff.</page><page sequence="23">MOSHE GREENBERG 79 In many psalms the wish or undertaking to praise God for his benefac- tions occurs without reference to sacrifice-a regular feature outside Israel as well. For example, Psalm 22:21 ft.: Save my life from the sword... Deliver me from a lion's mouth... Then will I proclaim your fame to my brethren, Praise you in the great congregation... And in a petition to Ishtar (ANET 385b): Let my prayers and my supplications come to thee ... As for me, let me glorify thy divinity and thy might before the blackheaded people: "Ishtar indeed is exalted, Ishtar indeed is queen... The valorous daughter of Sin has no rival!" In Israel, however, this motif underwent a refinement in that from time to time the votive praise of God is said to be preferable to the votive sacri- fice of thanksgiving. The underlying motive seems to be the desire to keep as far as possible from the shadow of suggestion that one is doing some- thing for God; hence sacrifice, even votive sacrifice, is shunned. I will extol God's name with song, And exalt him with praise. That will please the LORD more than oxen, Than bulls with horns and hooves. (Ps. 69:31 f.) The very same passage shows a refinement in another direction as well: the aim of the public praise is not merely glorification of God among men (that is a theme of ancient Near Eastern petitions), but more: The lowly will see and rejoice; You who are mindful of God, take heart! For the LORD listens to the needy, And does not spurn his captives. (vss. 33 f.) Recital of God's benefactions confirms the faith of hearers in his power and his faithfulness to deliver from distress. This is another aspect of the enthusiasm of the psalmist, noted above in connection with the summons to praise, save that now it is even clearer that the praise is not for the benefit or satisfaction of God, but to encourage his devotees by giving them another testimony to his goodness. At its peak of refinement, the votive praise of biblical prayer not only regards verbal acknowledgment as preferable to sacrifice, but intends to hold up an example to fellowmen in</page><page sequence="24">80 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER need. The cry for help is motivated not alone by a private concern, but by the desire to offer an occasion for the fortification of faith among the circle of God's seekers. That this is so is corroborated by another passage in which the psalmist rejects votive sacrifice: You gave me to understand that You do not desire sacrifice and meal offering; You do not ask for burnt offering and sin offering ...." To do what pleases you, my God, is my desire... I proclaimed your righteousness in a great congregation; See, I did not withhold my words ... O favor me O LORD, and save me... Let all who seek you be glad and rejoice in you; Let those who love your deliverance always say: Extolled be the LORD. (40:7-11, 17) The passage appears to say that the psalmist rejects sacrifice as a proper expression of gratitude for God's deliverance (described in vss. 2 f.). He was enlightened to understand that God preferred rather that he proclaim his saving deeds in public, and he did so. Now he is again in distress,2" and he asks for help, not merely for his own sake and for the sake of God's fame, but also to cheer "all those who seek" the LORD. " 'Those who seek you,' " comments Kimlyi, "are the same as 'those who love your de- liverance,' since they do not seek deliverance from any other source." The poet asks to be saved in order to bring joy to his co-believers, who, like him, resort to God in their distress, and, like him, broadcast God's saving acts to the world. The rescue of the psalmist will thus serve as a source of joy and encouragement to all the faithful. Yet a third verification that strengthening the faithful is an additional aim of votive praise comes from the peculiar undertaking of the author of Psalm 51, who likewise rejects the sacrificial thanksgiving: 22. A new surmise as to the meaning of verse 8 is contained in the Jewish Publica- tion Society version rendering: "Then I said, 'See, I will bring a scroll recounting what befell me.' " This admittedly speculative effort was inspired by the essay of H. L. Ginsberg mentioned in the previous note. 23. On the (at least secondary) unity of this psalm, evidenced by verbal and ideational connections between its two main parts, see the commentaries of Kissane and Weiser, and the detailed argument of N. H. Ridderbos, Die Psalmen: stylistische Verfahren und Aufbau ... (BZAW, 117, 1972), 289 ff.</page><page sequence="25">MOSHE GREENBERG 81 You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings. True sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit; God, you will not despise a contrite and crushed heart. (51:17 ff.) Now, beside his vow to praise- Save me from bloodguilt O God, God, my deliverer, That I may sing forth your beneficence. -the psalmist undertakes to do more: Let me teach transgressors your ways, That sinners may return to you. The request for pardon, the leading motive of this psalm, has here a larger purpose than a merely private one: the pray-er hopes to serve as an example to fellowmen of God's merciful ways with sinners, of God's readiness to accept their repentance. Again, the transcendence of the sacri- ficial mode of thanksgiving coincides with an explicit skewing of the pri- mary aim of the vow (to flatter or propitiate the deity) in the direction of benefit to fellowmen, of answering a human spiritual need. The vow was, as a matter of course, part of a prayer for deliverance, so much so that one psalmist can substitute "vow" for "prayer" in 61:6: "O God, you hear my vows; grant the plea of those who fear your name." Such prayer is described in a surprising fashion in 66:17: I called aloud to him, Glorification on my tongue (romam tahat lefoni).24 The meaning is hardly "that under the cry of distress lay already the cer- tainty of God's response. Under the lamenting tongue, the praise of grati- tude was already waiting" (H. J. Krauss). The verse speaks of laudation of God as a very component of petition. How is that? We have already noted that, contrary to Mesopotamian petitions, the biblical psalms of petition do not preface their requests by praises of God. Perhaps what 24. Vocalization of romam varies between short and long a; the former, taking the word as a polal (passive) "he was glorified," the latter, as a noun, "glorification" (pl cs romemot from *romamot, in Ps. 149:6). Tahat with speech organs ("tongue" in Ps. 10:7; "lips" in 140:4) is not different from 'al "on" in meaning. H. J. Krauss, Psalmer (Biblischer Kommentar; Neukirchen Kreis Moers; 1961), ad loc., rightly rejects emendations.</page><page sequence="26">82 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER our verse refers to is such passages as the following, occurring amidst calls for help: Good and upright is the LORD; Therefore he shows sinners the way. He guides the lowly in the right path, And teaches the lowly his way. All the LORD'S paths are steadfast love For those who keep the decrees of his covenant. (25:8 ff.) For you, my Lord, are good and forgiving, Abounding in steadfast love to all who call on you... There is none among the gods like you, O my Lord, And there are no deeds like yours ... For you are great and perform wonders; You alone are God. (86:5, 8) And in a communal petition: It was you who drove back the sea with your might, Who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters... The day is yours, the night also; It was you who set in place the orb of the sun; You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; Summer and winter-you made them. (74:13 ft.) Such allusions to God's wonderful attributes give the ground of the pray- er's confidence in the happy issue of his prayer. They summon God to verify to the pray-er the attributes for which he is famous, by manifesting them in his case. Invoking God's attributes is a source of hope to the pray-er in his hour of need: God need only be himself, and deliverance will come. That is the sense, too, of the repeated phrases, "Do it for your name's sake," or "for the sake of your faithfulness" or "righteousness." Another mode of this line of thought is found in Psalm 143. After relating his despondency in his time of trouble ("My spirit failed within me; my mind was numbed with horror"), the psalmist tells of a turning: Then I thought of the days of old; I rehearsed all your deeds, Recounted the work of your hands. I stretched out my hands to you, Longing for you like thirsty earth. He concludes, appropriately enough, "For the sake of your name, O LORD, preserve me; as you are beneficient, free me from distress. As you</page><page sequence="27">MOSHE GREENBERG 83 are faithful, put an end to my foes; destroy all my mortal enemies, for I am your servant." For the failing spirit, prayer is possible, the terror can be overcome, be- cause the pray-er can remember that God once before proved able to deliver.25 Similar are cases in which the pray-er says that he ventured to lay his petition before God only because God had previously assured him with respect to it. Thus Jacob: Save me, I beseech you, from the hand of my brother Esau; for I am afraid that he will come and slay me, as well the mothers and the children. But you promised, I will be sure to make you prosperous and make your descendants like the sands of the sea, too nu- merous to count. (Gen. 32:11 f.) Likewise David: For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you a house; therefore your servant has found the courage to pray this prayer to you. (2 Sam. 7:27) Likewise Solomon: . . that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant and to the supplication of your people Israel, to give ear to them whenever they cry to you. For you separated them from all the peo- ples of the earth to be your inheritance, as you promised through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God. (1 Kings 8:52 f.) In the light of this idea, let us consider the problem of the "precative perfect" in the Psalms. In recent times, M. Buttenweiser has made the most eloquent plea for regarding such passages as the following as con- taining a perfect that expresses a wish: 3:7 Buttenweiser Rise, O LORD; help me, O my God, ki hikkita 'et kol 'oyebay lehi Yea, smite all my enemies on the sinne r~sa'im libbarta cheek Break the teeth of the wicked. 25.

Buttenweiser rejects the contention that "in the people's present affliction, the Psalmist recalls God's wondrous delivery of them in the past." "But is it conceivable," he argues, "that any sane writer, when turning from the gloom of the present to the glory of the past, should fail to indicate the change of scene, and just leave it to his readers to divine his meaning?" 26 Yet it was the custom of supplicators to mention prior benefactions of God in their prayers, and in view of that custom, the shift of scene, especially when accompanied by a shift in tense, can hardly have been problematic. The ultimate meaning of such expressions is that the capability of prayer arises out of a prior experience of God's turning to men. Such prior ex- perience is of two types: in individual petitions, it may have been a direct private experience whose aftereffect was to keep one from despair in future troubles. When trouble came, his experience fortified him to trust in a repetition of God's turning: When I call, answer me, O God my vindicator; In trouble you have given me relief; Have mercy on me and hear my prayer. (4:2) In communal petitions, the prior experience may be mediate, through his- torical tradition which the psalmist has acquired as his own. In distress he is heartened by recalling God's past national deliverances. The capacity to pray is thus conditioned on the hope or trust that what happened once can happen again. That, we suggest, is the meaning of "supplicating God with glorification on one's tongue." If it is, then one who never experienced a saving act of God in his life, or did not adopt the faith in such a divine providence from the experience of a fellow man or the traditional history of his people, cannot know the fulness of biblical petitionary prayer, prayer, 26.

The dependence of prayer upon God is taken a step further in one or two passages. The author of Psalm 51 pleads: Save me from bloodguilt, O God, God my deliverer, That my tongue may sing forth your beneficence. O LORD, open my lips and let my mouth declare your praise. (vss. 16 f.) Kimhi glosses this aptly: "Let me have divine assistance in speaking." Another psalmist relates: He lifted me out of the miry pit... And set my feet on a rock... He put a new song into my mouth, A hymn to our God. (40:3 f.) (It is noteworthy that just these two psalms, 40 and 51, contain other, previously noted "peaks.") As one of two alternative explanations Kimhi gives: "He assisted me in song by means of inspiration, so that a song with fitting words issued from my mouth." The conception that songs of the divine service were inspired appears to have taken root by the end of the biblical age, to such an extent that the verb "prophesy" (nibba) served to denote the work of temple singers. We read in 1 Chronicles 25:1: "David and the commanders of the army also set apart for the service cer- tain of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun, who should prophesy with lyres, harps and cymbals." For further clarification we read of "Jeduthun, with the lyre, who prophesied, thanking and praising the LORD" (VS. 3). Similarly, the capacity to perceive God's working in the world, which, as indicated above, is the basis of trust in petitionary prayer, is also counted as a gift of God: O God, you have taught me from my youth, And until now I have proclaimed your wondrous deeds. (71:17) Kimhi glosses: "You have given me a discerning mind from youth to rec- ognize that all comes from you." Both themes occur in the Scroll of Thanksgiving Hymns from the wilderness of Judah. The author of the hymns counts among the kindnesses of God to him, "You set supplication</page><page sequence="30">86 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER in the mouth of your servant" (9.11)-i.e., the very formulation of peti- tion. Particularly illuminating is his novel use of ma'ane lason, "utterance of the tongue," a phrase derived from Proverbs 16:1: "A man may ar- range his thoughts, but the utterance of the tongue is from the LORD." You put into the mouth of your servant thanksgiving, praise and sup- lication, Thus creating utterance of the tongue for your creature. (11:34) I praise you by the spirits which you have put in me, I find utterance of the tongue to recount your beneficences. (17:17) This is combined with ascription to God of the power to discern his deeds in 11:4 f.: You make me perceive your wondrous deeds, And put thanks into my mouth and on my tongue, praise. Here are the origins of the idea that the book of Psalms as a whole is a product of the holy spirit. Let us sum up this ideational climax with respect to the dependence of the pray-er upon God. Prayer is address to God made possible by a prior turning, or initiative of God to work in the world, in the community, or in the life of an individual. Perception of such divine working is the life- breath of prayer, of petition and praise alike. This is so much the case, that pious souls, whose consciousness of dependence upon God is all-per- vasive, regard this precondition of prayer as a favor, a gift of God, a teach- ing he has taught them. As for the "utterance of the tongue," we under- stand the idea as follows: In his great concentration and high tension, the pray-er is empowered to frame his sentiments in words marvelously in accord with his need. He perceives this marvelous accord not as a native skill but as an inspiration, a gift of God. Testimonies are forthcoming elsewhere to verify this experience, of which the following description, taken from the eleventh century Duties of the Heart by the philosopher Bah.ya Ibn Paquda is a fine example. A man should endeavor to do more than was originally in his power, yearn for it with all his heart, rise to it in his thought, and . . . beseech God to help and strengthen him to acquire more knowledge and to serve him more than is at present within his capacity. If he perseveres, the Creator will grant his petitions, will open the gates to him, and strengthen his understanding and physical forces so that . . . he will be enabled to fulfil God's commandments in a higher degree than is</page><page sequence="31">MOSHE GREENBERG 87 now within his power, as it is said, "I am the LORD your God who teaches you profitably, who leads you in the way you should go" (Isa. 48:17). An analogy is the acquisition of skill in the arts and of proficiency in the sciences. When a person learns an art, he first prac- tices various parts of it and exerts himself according to his understand- ing to a lesser extent than his capacity. When his comprehension of the art increases, and he is continually engaged with it, the Creator shows him its fundamental principles and general rules. And from these he draws inferences which he did not learn from anyone. The expert in geometry . . . first teaches it to his pupil in the concrete, by means of the figures Euclid placed in his work. . . . When the pupil under- stands this well, and zealously . . . strives to acquire the knowledge of the deductions that should be drawn from the principles, the Creator teaches him abstraction . . . and he is able to deduce the most difficult figures and make the finest calculations which almost resemble pro- phecy vouchsafed by God. So it is with the other sciences. For if the pupil studies zealously, he will feel a higher spiritual power which no human being can give him. .. . Elihu said: "But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding" (Job 32:8) ... When the believer strives with heart and soul to fulfill [God's commands] and succeeds as far as is within his power, God will open the gate of spiritual excellences to him, so that he will . . . attain what was beyond his powers .... The following illustrates this thought: A man planted trees, broke the ground around them, cleared it of thorns and weeds, watered the trees when necessary and applied fertilizer; then he prays to God that they yield fruit. But if he neglects them, he does not deserve that the Creator give him fruit from them. The same is true of the service of God. If one strives and is keen to do what is within his power, God will aid him to achieve what is beyond his power . . . as our sages say: "Whoso fulfills the Torah amidst poverty will in the end fulfill it amidst riches." (Helbon Hannefes' 3, "the 21st way")27 All that has been said refers to spontaneous prayer that flows from a heart filled with emotion. But it is evident that even in biblical times not all prayers were spontaneous, nor was any prayer wholly original. Form criticism has amply shown the formulaic elements of all prayer, and the very collecting of psalms (the book and the smaller entities that preceded the final collection) attests 'to a need early felt for a treasury of prayer and 27.

Y. Kaufmann has noted the signs of the early fixing of psalm stereotypes: Every word of prayer is appropriate to the situation in which it is spoken; this is not the case of the psalms whose life context is given. Hannah's prayer (1 Sam. 1:11) accords with her condition, but her hymn of thanksgiving has only one verse (vs. 5, "the barren woman gave birth to seven") applicable specifically to her. This one verse was enough for the narrator to have Hannah recite the whole psalm, al- though verse 10 shows plainly that it is a royal thanksgiving hymn. Jonah's prayer (4:2 f.) fits his condition; the hymn of chapter 2, how- ever, is obviously a thanksgiving connected with the payment of vows in the temple. In verses 3 ft., the poet employs such figures as "from the belly of Sheol I cried out," and these were enough to justify ascribing the psalm to Jonah in the belly of the fish. . . . Such in- stances... of incongruity between a psalm and the occasion in which it is uttered are not editorial mistakes. Once a given psalm has be- come public property, its application to various situations is obviously considered justified if even a non-essential element can be conceived as relevant. This phenomenon-repeated . . . through the centuries with the psalms of the Psalter-appearing already in pre-exilic litera- ture testifies to the fixation of psalm stereotypes ... in early times.28 What is this tendency to use stereotypic psalms (and eventually non- poetic prayers too)? The answer is implied in what has been said above with respect to the inspiration of prayer. It is not to be supposed that every psalmist, or even most, experienced a divine afflatus guiding his creativity. Nevertheless, the vitality and urgency that emanate from many of the psalms testify to the passion of their authors. True, there is no psalm alto- gether free of the fixed usages and formulas that belonged to the common stock of ancient Hebrew poetry; on the other hand, there is scarcely a single psalm made up entirely of such formulas. In most, a creative spirit moves, using the formulas in novel combinations and adding original ele- ments. The very difficulty of finding regular structure to psalms of a given category, and the consequent recourse to "mixed categories" in form criti- cism of the psalms, speaks for the origin of many of them in genuine spirit- ual excitation. The contrast with the regularity of structure and fixity of elements in Akkadian hymns and prayers is remarkable, and suggests the deliberateness and artifice of the composition of the latter.2" Every now 28.

Soden, Sumerische and Akkadische Hymnen and Gebete, 37 ff.</page><page sequence="33">MOSHE GREENBERG 89 and then a psalmist betrays a certain consciousness of authorship which points to a sense of originality: in 28:7 the poet says, "I will glorify him mis~'ri-by one of my songs"; in 45:2 the author of a royal wedding song expressly describes the stages of the creation of his poem. Now, a man less gifted poetically, agitated by circumstances similar to those that inspired a psalmist but unable to express the turbulence of his soul with like aptness, will have recourse to the psalm for an adequate vehicle of his emotion. He obtains relief through the record of the emotion of his predecessor. The prepared verses acquire a new, personal significance as they are suffused by the sentiment of the reciter. But there is also a re- verse effect: the emotion of the reciter is itself shaped-perhaps even purged and sublimated-by being filtered through the expression of the psalmist. Thus the fixed text becomes an instrument by which the thought of the ancients becomes renewed and enriched through the experience of later generations, while itself working cathartically upon them. An analogy may be drawn between the power of a fixed prayer text and that of a festival rite to train the spirit. An epoch-making event that altered the course of national life is captured in a festival whose rite is calculated to evoke the event in the consciousness of the celebrants. When the festi- val is kept afterward, not merely a memory is evoked, but something of the formative effect of the primary event on the souls of those who under- went it. Just as the destiny of the first experiencers was shaped by the event, so the destiny of their descendants is by the celebration of the fes- tival. The parallelism with the effect of fixed prayer texts may be spelled out thus: The affecting event generates a festival/a prayer that embodies its emo- tional charge. Celebration of the festival rite/recital of the prayer as a fixed text arouses and releases emotions similar to those of the primary celebrants/pray-er. Thus the festival/the fixed prayer gives shape to the feelings of later generations, and conserves in them the values of the founders. There is, of course, the danger of automatism both in the repeated cele- bration of festivals and the repetition of fixed prayers. That is the object of the divine censure in Isaiah 29:13: Because that people has approached me with its mouth and honored me with its lips, but has kept its heart far from me, and its worship of me has been a commandment of men, learned by rote...</page><page sequence="34">90 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER Nonetheless, neither biblical religion nor any since has been able to dis- pense altogether with norm and form as vehicles and trainers of spon- taneity, and as guarantors of continuity and generational solidarity for the community. What is significant about the fixation of prayer texts in bibli- cal religion is its aim, as described above. It is at the farthest remove from the purpose of the rigorous formulation known from paganism, which served magical and theurgic ends.30 This brings us back, by way of conclusion, to the start of our inquiry. Prayer, both in the form of petition and of praise, has as its primitive root the conception that god and man are related as master and servant, king and subject. The need for petition arises originally out of the notion that the knowledge of the gods is limited; praise springs from the desire to propitiate them by flattery. In biblical thought, there was a constant refinement of the idea of worship away from such simple beginnings to the acknowledgement of dependence upon God. Prayer became a vehicle of humility, an expression of un-self-sufficiency, which, in biblical thought, is the proper stance of man before God. In its highest reaches, biblical prayer remains still the embodiment of the awareness of creaturehood, as much a contrast to theurgic incantation as to the self-containedness of man-centered modernism. 30. The passage from Isaiah just quoted is the clearest evidence of an awareness of the difference between a magical and a religious attitude toward forms of worship. For the people reproved, the form was the essence; prayer was a matter of mouth and lips. For God, prayer must issue from the heart. Another passage to the same effect is Psalm 78:36 f.: Yet they deceived him with their speech, Lied to him with their words; Their hearts were inconstant toward him; They were untrue to his covenant. Ibn Ezra glosses vs. 37 excellently: "This shows that the essence of prayer is the in- tention of the heart." In antiquity, the theurgic notion of prayer was embodied with peculiar force in the Roman liturgy, whose concern over adherence to correct form is notorious. Heiler (Prayer, 72) cites Wissowa thus: "[Roman prayer is] the necessary oral explanation of the ritual act which on the mortals' side completes the legal business, and when given in the correct form at the same time compels the divinity to take his part in the juridical relation." Contrast Maimonides' summation of the reason for the adop- tion of prescribed prayer texts in Judaism, given in his Code, Laws of Prayer, 1:4: the exiled Jews spoke a mixture of languages and could not adequately express them- selves in Hebrew; hence a fixed liturgy was composed "so that the stammerers might speak as correctly as those who spoke perfectly." This bears a familial similarity to the reason 1 have proposed.</page><page sequence="35">MOSHE GREENBERG 91 POSTSCRIPT In a forthcoming study entitled "Ancient Near Eastern Patterns in Prophetic Literature," which he was good enough to show me, my col- league Professor Moshe Weinfeld compares biblical passages preferring praise to sacrifice, to Egyptian material, of which the most striking item is from the end of "The Shipwrecked Sailor" (suggested date, eleventh dynasty, ca. 2000 B.C.E.). Seeking to propitiate the serpent, lord of the island onto which he was cast by the sea, the sailor promises him that, when he is rescued, he will "have brought to you ladanum, heknu-oil, iudeneb, cassia, and incense.... You will be thanked in (my) town in the presence of the magistrates of the entire land. I shall sacrifice to you oxen . . , and I shall wring the necks of birds for you, etc." The serpent laughs at the sailor, and replies: ". .. Indeed, I am the Prince of Punt; myrrh belongs to me. That heknu-oil of which you spoke about bringing me, why it is the main product of this island!" Later, when the sailor is finally rescued, the serpent's parting words are, "Place my good repute in your town; this is all I ask from you." (W. K. Simpson, ed., The Literature of Ancient Egypt [New Haven, 1972], p. 55 [lines 139-160]). The similarity with biblical passages discussed above is indeed worthy of note (and I am grateful to Professor Weinfeld for pointing it out to me), but so too are the differences. First, while the serpent disdains the sailor's offer because it is from his island that (part of) the offering comes, God rejects Israel's sacrifice in the comparable Psalm 51:9-12 because, in the last analysis, Israel has failed to adjust its appreciation of sacrifice to the fact that God does not eat or drink (vs. 13). The serpent's disdain arises out of an accident of the story (he owns the source of Egypt's spices); there is no inkling of a suggestion that by analogy the cosmic gods take (or could take) a similar view of man's sacrificing at large. Nor do we have evidence elsewhere in Egyptian literature that thinkers developed such an idea on a general, cosmic scale. The psalmist, however, first generalized on the low level of the serpent when he had the cosmic God say, ". . . Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for mine is the world and all it holds" (vs. 12); he then immediately advanced to his, and his audience's peculiarly transcendent level with the question, "Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of he-goats?" (vs. 13). Second, while both the serpent and the biblical God are above the material gifts of man (for different reasons), the substitution therefor of praise to the former is merely to flatter his</page><page sequence="36">92 REFINEMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF PRAYER self-esteem; the substitution of praise to the latter (as, e.g., in Ps. 69:31 f.) is in every case more than a matter of flattery, as I have argued above. Why the serpent in this story should prefer a boost to his reputation over the offer made by the sailor is readily understandable. Why a cosmic God, who stands in no need of man, should "require" praise or sacrifice, let alone prefer one to the other, cannot be understood by simple transference of notions from Egypt to Israel. I have tried to penetrate the transvaluations that accompany the adoption in Israel of common Near Eastern language and forms of worship.</page></plain_text>
