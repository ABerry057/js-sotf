<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tal Ilan. Jewish Women in Greco-Roman Palestine: An Inquiry into Image and Status. Texte und Studien zum Antiken Judentum 44. Tilbingen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1995. xiii, 270 pp. This book is intended as a feminist work which "makes use of all the sources and source-critical techniques to describe in a well-balanced and thorough manner the history of Jewish women in Palestine during a period of such great interest and so many vicissitudes" (p. 21). The result is a detailed study covering a broad range of issues, such as sexuality (e.g., virginity, chastity, pregnancy), legal status (e.g., testimony, inheritance), and social institutions (e.g., marriage, divorce), and considers a number of individual figures, such as Beruriah and Matrona. Each section provides a description and analysis of primary sources, and, in some cases, interaction with scholarly opinion. The strength of this study lies in its detailed presentation of rabbinic sources. For example, the discussion of inheritance examines texts from the Mishnah, Tosefta, Babylonian Talmud, Jerusalem Talmud, and Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, and briefly considers nonrabbinic texts, such as Judith and the writings of Josephus. On the basis of these sources, Tal Ilan argues that a father or husband was permitted to transfer property to his daughters or wife to ensure a reasonable standard of living after his death, "all this despite the quite specific biblical laws against inheritance and property ownership by women" (p. 170).1 The discussion of Beruriah not only gathers the relevant primary 1. Of course, the biblical data suggest that this statement requires some qualification. The episode of the daughters of Zelophehad in Numbers 27 and 36 demonstrates that women could inherit, at least when there were no sons; and the statement in Proverbs 31:16 and the transaction recorded in Ruth 4 demonstrate that women could own, buy, and sell property.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 115 sources but also debunks popular myth by arguing that "the great Torah scholar who was the amoraic Beruriah was the product of the imagination of the amoraim" (p. 200). Interesting and informative as the specific discussions are, however, the book as a whole falls short of being a "well-balanced and thorough" feminist history of Jewish women in Palestine. Many points warrant comment, but I restrict my remarks to three. First, despite the subject matter and the author's claims in the preface (p. xi), this is not a feminist work. Ilan uncritically assumes the outmoded opposition between feminist scholarship and proper "objective" historical scholarship, and aligns herself with the latter, although she appears to be aware of the strong feminist challenge to this dichotomy (p. 13). For example, she lauds Rachel Biale's Women and Jewish Law (New York, 1984), which, "despite its clear feminist aims," has nevertheless "managed to establish certain unmediated facts" (p. 16), but dismisses feminist scholarship on halakhah (in which Biale's work is surely included) because of its concern with contemporary issues (p. 176). Worse, this principle is not applied consistently. For example, she cites L. J. Swidler extensively to support her own analyses of New Testament passages despite her judgment concerning the apologetic nature of Swidler's work (p. 11), and draws frequently upon the studies by B. Witherington, whose work serves a contemporary conservative Christian "family values" agenda. Ilan's blanket dismissal of current feminist scholarship cuts her off from insights into her source texts as well as into a range of gender-related issues (e.g., same-sex friendship and sexuality) that are not only central to current Jewish feminist historiography but present in the sources under consideration. Also jarring is the use of masculine language in speaking of historians (pp. 1,43). The second problem relates to methodology. Ilan recognizes the need for caution both in using sources written or redacted outside the Land of Israel to reconstruct the situation in Palestine, and in tapping fifth-century and later texts for information within her chronological framework (ca. 300 B.C.E. to 200 C'.E.). Nevertheless, some of her methodological decisions are questionable. It is not made clear, for example, why an aggadah in which the woman is integral to the story is "of less historical value" than an aggadah "whose central figure could just as easily be a male" (p. 35). Further, having established this criterion, Tal herself does not abide by it. For example, she considers the many stories in which rabbinic authorities allow widows to remarry--stories which have women as integral figures and address exceptional circumstances-to demonstrate that "not many Jewish women remained widows for very long"</page><page sequence="3">116 BOOK REVIEWS (p. 151). Also problematic is Ilan's use of early Christian materials. She argues, for example, that the neutral tone of Acts makes it a more reliable historical source than the Gospel of John (p. 180), yet scholars have long been aware that the author of Acts, like the Fourth Evangelist, had his own particular ideological and theological agendas which influenced his presentation of the early decades of the Christian movement. Elsewhere, she cites John 4 as evidence that Jesus challenged the "rabbinic laws of purity" by drinking from the cup of the Samaritan woman (p. 105). Here Ilan misreads both the content and the theology of the text. Though Jesus requests a drink, he does not partake. Rather, his request serves a rhetorical purpose, which is not to challenge first-century purity laws but rather to contrast well-water, which slakes only temporarily, with the living water of eternal life (4:14). These and other misinterpretations could have been avoided by consulting standard New Testament commentaries. Finally, the book focuses on a period of approximately five centuries, during which Judaism, in Palestine as in the Diaspora, was influenced by the Greek language, and by Roman as well as Hellenistic culture, literature, social institutions, and practices. Yet apart from recognizing the vicissitudes of this period, Ilan says little about the changing role of women over time, or about the influence of Hellenism on the status of women and on the sources from which the roles of women are constructed. At the very least, such questions should have been raised in the conclusion, which is too brief to provide the synthetic analysis appropriate to so broad a historical study. These and other problems notwithstanding, the book, and the impressive amount of data it contains, is a valuable resource for the study of Jewish women in Greco-Roman Palestine.
