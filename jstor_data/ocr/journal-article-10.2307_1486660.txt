<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian Peckham. History and Prophecy: The Development of Late Judean Literacy Traditions. New York: Doubleday, 1993. xiv, 880 pp. The order and sequence of [Isaiah, Amos, and Hosea] can be gathered from their mutual acquaintance and from the books they have read. Isaiah knew the national epic [a prose epic, Yahwist, work written sometime before 701] and imitated its episodic form but rejected its implication that, according to the covenant between Yahweh and Israel, worship was right and nothing else mattered. He [Isaiah] did not refer to Amos or Hosea, but they knew his prophecy; and like the author of the sequel to the epic [a first edition of the deuteronomic history, pointing to "the final acquisition of the land under Hezekiah" (p. 85), and whose conclusion is seen in 2 Kgs 19:36-37] they made a point of quoting and adapting his words. Amos also knew the sequel to the epic, and, in turn, his best-known saying was quoted by the Priestly writer. Hosea used some of Amos's liturgical material and was acquainted with Isaiah and the earlier historians. . . . They all . .. flourished in the reigns of Hezekiah and Manasseh. (p. 134) Three prophets responded to the Deuteronomist's contention that Jerusalem was captured because of a history of sin that was fully manifested in the reign of Manasseh. Joel wrote an elegant and ironic reply suggesting the capture of the city was just a natural calamity. . . . Obadiah avoided direct confrontation with the theory by describing the event and blaming Edom for being involved. Jonah scoffed at the dtr. idea that the city was destroyed because it did not listen to the prophets by noting that a typical prophet did not want repentance but simple retribution ... (p. 657) These two quotations are illustrative of this volume. It represents an attempt at grand synthesis, one in which all the literature included in the Hebrew Bible is presented as an ongoing symposium among the great men of the past who authored these writings, one in which each of them responds in one way or another to the ideas advanced by preceding great minds. As a result, Brian Peckham proposes a complete sequence of the Judean literature.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 Significantly, he also dates works according to their relative places in the proposed sequence.1 Peckham's reconstruction of the thought and literary style of (the his- torical) Isaiah, Amos, Hosea, and the others, is explicitly based on his own reconstruction of their original words. The unusual referents that Peckham assigns to common code-words like "Deuteronomistic History," "II Isaiah," and "III Isaiah" are worth noting in this regard. The former, for instance, consists of eight books. Among these, one book included most of present Genesis, another most of Exodus, and a third consisted of Lev 8:1-11:45 together with most of the present book of Numbers. As for II Isaiah, his writing includes, among other texts, Isa 1:laBb, 11:1-10, 12:1-6, 14:1-21, 15:1-6, and the Isaiah narratives in Isa 36:1-39:8. III Isaiah is responsible for, among others, Isa 2:6-22, 13:1-22, 23:13-28:8, 31:1-35:10, 40:12-31, and 44:1-28. Also, new figures of great thinkers or writers or both that purport to be historical come into being in Peckham's work, such as II Hosea, the editor of Hosea, to whom he attributes Hos 1:1, 5, 7; 2:1-3; 2:17aB, 20b; 3:1-5; 4:2aB, 4-5, 6b, 9, 11, 13b-15; 5:1-2, 5, 8-10; 6:7-11; 7:lb, 3-7, 10, 15-16; 8:4-6, 10; 13bB, 14; 9:9, 10b, 15; 10:3, 7-8a, 9-10, 13-15; 11:6-11; 12:6-7, 12; 13:2-aB, 9-11, 15; 14:1-10, and who lived around 525 B.C.E., and whose work is later than, for instance, that of II Amos, II Micah, II Ezekiel, and Jonah, but precedes that of II Habakkuk, II Zephaniah, II Nahum, and II Jonah, among others. As for its goal, History and Prophecy reminds this reviewer of works such as Wellhausen's Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel or Kaufmann's Toldot ha-'Emunah ha-Yilra'elit. Still, it is very unlikely-at least in the opinion of this reviewer-that this volume will exert an influence similar to that of Wellhausen's work in the general community of critical biblical scholars, or that of Kaufmann's in Israeli biblical scholarship. Wellhausen's Prolegomena was a rhetorically powerful and well-argued presentation of approaches that were evolving in the critical community; Kaufmann's work was a strong critique of Wellhausen's (although both shared the tendency to lionize the prophets) that reflects some of the Jewish, and especially the Israeli, perspectives of his time. Peckham's approach, in contrast, seems to be in tension with many of the tendencies in current literary and historical-critical studies of the Hebrew Bible. Thus it is probably not by chance that, despite Peckham's considerable 1. See his explicit critique of H. Barth on p. 207, n. 1.</page><page sequence="3">134 BOOK REVIEWS bibliography and his obvious knowledge of much of the preceding scholarship, his references to other works in the footnotes are relatively scarce, and in most cases deal only with minor points. For instance, his notes to the study of Isaiah, II Isaiah, and III Isaiah do not refer the reader to any works by O. Kaiser, R. E. Clements, R. Rendtorff, M. Sweeney, C. Seitz, E. W. Conrad, J. Vermeylen, O. H. Steck, Y. Gitay, or R. F. Melugin, to mention only a few scholars whose studies-no matter how sympathetic or unsympathetic one may be to their conclusions-have had an impact in recent Isaianic scholarship. His use of common code-words with unusual referents also suggests a certain degree of aloofness. Moreover, the plethora of literary approaches (including those which have relevancy to questions of literary unity), and of historical, linguistic, sociological, and anthropological studies that have contributed so much to the present "instability" of biblical studies, is only faintly reflected in this work. Peckham's thesis will not garner the support of those who have qualms with his starting point for biblical studies, i.e., an analysis of the text to the purpose of reconstructing earlier works, rather than focusing on the received text; nor of those who question his ability to reconstruct original works to the precision of a few words in verse; nor of those who have reservations about the historical referentiality of literary figures; nor of those who are not persuaded by the consistency of a construction based, to a large degree, on circular thinking; nor of those who reject the model of the great figures of the past as the main model for writing history. Still, even those who reject Peckham's position will find his book stimulating, and his thesis of a restricted group of great thinkers conversing among themselves through history interesting, even if not convincing.
