<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY TELLING LIVES by WILLIAM CUTTER Alan Mintz. Banished from Their Father's Table.- Loss of Faith and Hebrew Autobiography. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989. ix, 223 pp. Alan Mintz has on a number of occasions placed specific literary prob- lems in a capacious context. In Banished from Their Father's Table, he explores the form of the Hebrew autobiography, and argues that there is a relationship between the loss of faith in the post-Enlightenment period and the emergence of the autobiographical novel: "At this moment in literary history there occurs a substantial intersection between a particular theme, which I shall call the apostasy narrative, and a particular form, the autobio- graphical mode" (p. 5). According to the author, Jewish autobiography (by such writers as Lilienblum and Guenzberg), and the antecedent tradition of historical auto- biography in Western Europe (for which Rousseau was a model, and which Maimon introduced), helped set the stage for the autobiographical novels of Feierberg, Berdichevsky, and Brenner. Mintz deals with these three authors of the literary revival through subthemes that have been discussed before, but which are manipulated here into new shapes and new relationships. His 83</page><page sequence="2">84 WILLIAM CUTTER chapters on Brenner's In Winter (Ba-Horej) use prisms that bring new focus to the well-known thematic of the talush, Simon Halkin's term for the doubly "uprooted hero" in modern Hebrew literature. These prisms are the chapter headings for his treatment of Brenner: "The Revision of Child- hood"; "The Veil of Ideas"; and "The Erotic Subversion." I was surprised at first that Mintz did not spend more time on the tradition of the talush; but upon reflection I found the lone reference symbolic of his attempt to estab- lish new terms for the interpretation of this literature. Not only are the terms new, but his study affords a more "affective"perspective on the tradition. Mintz's talush is a figure more richly characterized. (We await more com- plete work on the women of these men, although Mintz offers interesting beginnings in two parts of the book.) Mintz sets the stage for these central chapters with an excellent reading of sections of Berdichevsky's A Raven Flies ('Urva' Parab) and Feierberg's Whither (Le'an). He makes available to non-Hebrew readers two important authors in a rich interpretive context, and-since A Raven Flies is not availa- ble in English-his translations of portions of this novel are especially important. He also reads A Raven Flies in tandem with Berdichevsky's famous third-person narrative Two Camps (Mahanayim). This is the second study in which Mintz has organized literature around specific themes and suggested an organization which both reconceptualizes a body of the literature and offers a perspective by which individual works may be read. In his earlier work, Hurban, Mintz dealt with the literature of "lamentation" as consolation, suggesting that it served as a way for the Jewish nation to revise its sense of catastrophe. Mintz suggests that tragedy was often alleviated when exegesis helped people derive meaning from the catastrophe. In the perspective of that earlier book and the literature it treats, the still transcendent God is partially redeemed through the literature of consolation. The range of that literature was extremely broad, requiring Mintz to deal with everything from classic lore to modern short stories under the same thematic rubric. The literature treated in Banished is restrict- ed to two forms of the autobiography, so in that sense the organization of the book is less bold. Here the speculation is complex, however, and some- what controversial. In the literature before us efforts at resolution are limit- ed to the working out of the story of each individual, either banished from the table or voluntarily in exile from the ennui within the original home. In the sense that all writing represents some kind of release, then, there is respite from the toll of banishment. But in the sense that the writer might</page><page sequence="3">TELLING LIVES 85 become attached to a transcendent Source and thus be freed from the condi- tion and the conditional, the writing which Mintz describes does not deal in hope. Neither the act of creativity nor the development of the Hebrew lan- guage gratifies. There is no linguistic messianism a la Walter Benjamin, nor artistic salvation as in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. (I think some Benjaminesque ideas can be seen within Bialik's language essays, but that is another matter.) Thus, on the one hand, the literature is understood to respond to an historical need, but it is also understood that this need could not be met. In his note on Ada Zemach's argument about writing in Brenner (p. 218, n. 23), Mintz at least introduces the possibility of some redemptive role for writing; but he ultimately rejects it. There is no surcease. The characters fashioned by Brenner and Berdi- chevsky especially suffer even in their little success. Gershon Shaked's phrase le-lo' moSa' ("dead end" or "no exit") is emblematic of the era and its men; while his description of Brenner (and Brenner's camouflaged anti- heroes) as 'ish ha-makh'ovot ("man of sorrows") describes these antiheroes even when they find the temporary relief of such idyllic moments as exist at the conclusion of Breakdown and Bereavement (Shekhol ve-khishalon). Mintz's chapter on erotic shame is both technically valuable and emotional- ly telling: a description of the literary values in Berdichevsky's oeuvre, and a characterization of the emotional climate of the intellectual for whom the Haskalah failed. Indeed, in one important paragraph, Mintz cites Dan Miron's assessment of Two Camps ("The Turning Point in Modern Hebrew Fiction in Mahanayim") as having as its theme the failure of the discovery of sexuality. "Michael's is the story," says Mintz, "of the unmaking of a mas- kil, who is undone by forces he never succeeds in bringing to consciousness" (p. 92). This failure is the underpinning of the stories by Gnessin, Shofman, Brenner, Berdichevsky and Feierberg. Viewing their writing as a critical part of the chain in the national revival is complex; our knowledge that it may be the most important prose literature in this chain represents a monumental irony. No amount of romanticism on the part of readers who, like myself, encountered this material as young men can make its characters attractive. No cynicism about institutional efforts to see national Jewish culture as redemptive can remove the fundamental pathos which dominated an entire era of Jewish creativity. For Mintz apostasy "created but did not quicken" the world of these intellectuals (p. 205). It is in the light of this irony that the conclusion to Feierberg's magnum opus Whither fits into Mintz's argument</page><page sequence="4">86 WILLIAM CUTTER about the absence of redemption. For even as Nachman, its hero, sees the only solution in migration to Eretz Yisrael, his sense of that migration involves a rejection of Western values and an advocacy of Levantinism. In light of the developments in modern Israel and Jewish history, this also is no solution. I think contemporary readers-even readers who do not regularly approach this fiction-will appreciate Mintz's touching and disturbing reflection on life at the turn of the century. But the reflection comes from a specific historical failure. Mintz's treatment forces him to utilize a method which will not please every reader. Because he encourages readers to see a kind of literary neces- sity in the development of autobiography, he offers a restricted reading, even as he enriches our thinking about the development of literature in the early years of the twentieth century. For surely the social and literary conditions of Eastern Europe drove its literature no less into the third-person novel: witness the best example of all in Bershadsky's Without a Goal (Be-'Ein Matarah), whose hero, Adamowitz, is also "banished from his father's table." It might be said that Mintz fails to figure out a way to explain such a third-person novel whose characteristics are much the same in almost every way-at least in terms of the individual and society being represented-as the autobiographical novel. And as far as "ironizing" and distance, which Mintz suggests the first-person novel provided, one could argue that third- person narrative achieves this in an even more nimble fashion. His explana- tion that the "confessional" dimension is missing in the third-person nar- rative (p. 19) was difficult for me, especially in light of some of the narrative invention practiced by Brenner to combine first- and third-person tech- niques (One Year and Breakdown and Bereavement especially). Indeed Mintz himself deals with this literary issue in his treatment of Feierberg. Every critical approach sacrifices one strength for another. Yet we must ask whether Mintz's excellent reading of In Winter does not ultimately deprive readers of two additional possibilities: reading the novel in terms of the special techniques which make that novel succeed as a whole; and examining similar techniques of Brenner's in other works. (On p. 217, n. 14, Mintz explains his rejection of purely formalistic criticism of Brenner.)' One example might suffice. 1. "As with much of this New Critical study, the observations about formal techniques fail to become connected to the profound thematics of Brenner's work" (p. 217). Referring here to Joseph Ewen's 'Omanut ha-Sippur shel Y H. Brenner [Y. H. Brenner's craft of fiction], Mintz makes his case based on the extreme counter-case.</page><page sequence="5">TELLING LIVES 87 In several of Brenner's novels, characters begin their "story" with some reference to the reception of their novel or to the "authentic" nature of the text. Each of these introductions captures the significant ambivalence of the author-narrator-character. In so doing the introductions tell readers some- thing more about the character as author, about "characters" of this period in general, and-most importantly-about the nature of decision making in a world which, to paraphrase the original Bavli, has banished itself from the table of the eternal parent. The strategies for enhancing the autobiographi- cal involvement of the author-narrator and their effect on the fiction itself might be a critical part of the larger understanding of these stories, especial- ly since they comport nicely with most of Mintz's thesis. (See Mintz's own comment on the "formal" and thematic axis on p. 18.) But these are minor quibbles, and they are a little like criticizing an author for not doing something he did not intend to do in the first place. In this work Mintz clearly wishes to avoid the "self-referential" study of litera- ture which is tempting in today's literary climate, and prefers not to deal exclusively with structures. He chooses instead to present the relations of literary issues to the development of one of Jewish modernity's most inter- esting psychosocial and aesthetic developments. Whatever is left out by his selection, his book will invite more nonreaders of literature into his circle, while preserving important technical canons of reading. His pursuit of psychological descriptions or explanations (citing Kohut, Piers, and Singer) felt a bit forced at times. But those references are the beginning of another possible study, and may help make Banished interesting to yet another kind of reader. His bibliography and notes include extensive references to writing on autobiography, and historians and social scientists, as well as literary critics and scholars, will find these citations extremely helpful. Mintz argues that new models of autobiography in Hebrew afford us the opportunity to compare the effect of historical study with the study of fic- tion, since narrative fiction takes us into "reflection on domestic relations, romantic experience, crises of self-doubt, or belief in the cause" (p. 204). For him, the early twentieth century marked the end of a literary form which had a brief life, but which had extended influence. He does not deal with the question of why this phenomenon was its own kind of "'urva' parah" (an expression normally used to suggest something transitory). But his concluding chapter is a contribution to the general literature on autobio- graphy-even with its focus on Hebrew literature. I would be interested in seeing a discussion of the autobiographical form in the American Jewish novel; this might create a link between Eastern</page><page sequence="6">88 WILLIAM CUTTER Europe and America usually reserved for Yiddish writing. (In my own fantasy as I anticipated the book's publication, I had hoped Mintz might give an even closer reading to Two Camps, especially with its Silesian ice skating scene at the beginning, anticipating one of Alexander Portnoy's most powerful contexts: the skating and athleticism of Gentiles in a New Jersey winterscape.) Alan Mintz has greatly enriched the study of Hebrew literature. Since his earliest work on the novel (George Eliot and the Novel of Vocation), he has helped develop one of the major forums for Jewish text study in Prooftexts, and he has written on a vast array of subjects in essays and reviews which have been essential for our study of modern Hebrew literature. In addition, he has expanded the criticism of that literature, as in the case at hand and in the case of Hurban. He has introduced renewed interest in the American Hebrew tradition, and has helped place the study of modern Hebrew litera- ture on the agenda of Jewish studies without sacrificing its place on the agenda of general literary study. We are clearly in his debt. We can be grate- ful guests as we welcome another of his books to the study table, where he is a graceful host. Hebrew Union College Los Angeles, Calif.</page></plain_text>
