<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yochanan Silman. Philosopher and Prophet: Judah Halevi, the "Kuzari," and the Evolution of His Thought. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. x, 370 pp. Yochanan Silman presents Judah Halevi's Kuzari "as an autobiographical work in which Halevi described the evolution of his thought, marked by vacillation and contradictions, which are expounded in the course of the dialogue that ties the book together" (p. viii). The Kuzari thus recapitulates, indeed in the very order in which speakers and positions are presented, Halevi's intellectual autobiography, and for Silman this journey proceeds through three distinct stages. The first and earliest of these is (strictly) philosophical, represented by the Aristotelian philosopher and his positions in the Kuzari, about which, according to Silman, "[Halevi] had reservations by the time he wrote the book" (p. 11). The second stage in Halevi's intellectual development is exemplified by his critique of Karaism. Here Halevi is committed to the essential harmony of Judaism and Aristotelian philosophy (p. 162), but the (rabbinic) critique of Karaism has the effect of slowly but surely calling into question that very harmonization of Judaism and philosophy. According to Silman, this second, intermediate stage in Halevi's intellectual development is presented in Kuzari III, I.68-79, and 11. 1-7. In agreement with D. H. Baneth, Silman views part III and the anti-Karaite critique as constituting the first edition of the Kuzari, the earliest stratum of what in time became the final text of the work we now have. (We should note that what emerges even at this point in Silman's schema is that the "autobiographicality" of the Kuzari, with its artful ordering of speakers and their respective positions, is out of sync with the actual order, the history, of its composition; that is, the [purported]</page><page sequence="2">128 BOOK REVIEWS earliest stage of Halevi's thought, the Aristotelian stage, represented by the philosopher and his positions, was written subsequently to the stage which succeeded it. Such an anachronism should alert us to the possible ahistoricity of the work as a whole, and to skepticism about its assumed autobiographicality.) And finally, Silman presents a third stage in Halevi's intellectual autobiography, the rabbinic stage, represented by the positions of the rabbi in the text. This stage presents a critique of the earliest, philosophical (Aristotelian) stage and "accords a prominent role to the problem posed by the actual present situation of the Jewish people" (p. 171). In sum, for Silman, Halevi's intellectual development passes from abstract, general, and universal theorizing to a concrete, particularistic, and nationalistic-historical sensibility. Silman describes this journey as "the spiritual development of a human being from paganism to Judaism" (p. 338). There are problems I think, with Silman's developmental scheme. He presents it as historical and chronological, as the diachronic development of Halevi's thought from philosophy to prophecy, "from paganism to Judaism." But, baldly put, there is not a shred of evidence for the first stage in the story Silman tells. Again, there is no evidence that Halevi was ever committed to Aristotelianism. And such evidences as Silman presents (pp. 9-10) from the Kuzari itself (from 5.2 and 4.15) are spectacular cases of special pleading, which will only convince those who already believe that Halevi started out as a committed Aristotelian. Contra Silman, there are only two stages in Halevi's intellectual career, corresponding to Silman's second and third stages, namely, an early anti-Karaite stage and a later anti-Aristotelian stage. And even this way of putting the matter is a bit dubious. Why not simply suppose that Halevi is throughout committed to rabbinic Judaism and allow this commitment to account for both his anti-Karaism and his anti-Aristotelianism? It should perhaps be noted here that Halevi's anti-Aristotelianism is not ipso facto a general critique of philosophy; there are, after all, non-Aristotelian philosophical positions. Silman, however, seems to slide from the particular to the general, and in so doing overlooks the possibility that Halevi's very rabbinism is compatible with some sort of philosophical outlook, one not offensive to his rabbinic sensibilities. And on this assumption one might well conclude that the harmony of Judaism and philosophy, the hallmark of Halevi's anti-Karaite stage, is never, pace Silman, forsaken. Halevi is not the anti-philosopher that Silman in the final analysis makes him out to be. The "earliest" stage in Halevi's career, then, is a myth, ultimately postu- lated to support a Straussian reading of the Kuzari and Halevi's intellectual</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 129 development which sees it as a progression from a philosophical position to an anti-philosophical, rabbinic position committed to the view that no road leads from Athens to Jerusalem. But in questioning such a developmental scheme, one can begin to understand and appreciate the (purported) foundational stage, as well as the very order in which speakers and their respective positions are presented, as nothing but a literary artifice against which Halevi can effectively present the truth as he perceives it. In brief, the Kuzari is art, not autobiography. And the tip-off is the aforementioned asymmetry between the actual order of its composition and the final text we have before us. If in fact the Kuzari started out as a rabbinic critique of Karaism, then we might well suppose that this represents the terminus a quo of Halevi's intellectual life, one superseded (or perhaps better, amplified) by the (further) rabbinic critique of Aristotelianism. Such a story of Halevi's intellectual development is credible, for its plausibility does not depend upon a period for which we have no evidence, and it also has the virtue of allowing the historical composition of the work, rather than the artfulness of the final product, to dictate the course of Halevi's intellectual development.
