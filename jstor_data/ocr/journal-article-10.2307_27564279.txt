Abecassis begins his study of French novelist Albert Cohen by por traying the reception of Cohen's work as a paradox. Although Cohen is generally acknowledged as one of the great French writers of the twentieth century, his novels rarely find their way into French national examinations, he never became a media figure, and the publication of his oeuvre by the prestigious Bib lioth?que de la Pl?iade collection in the early 1990s inspired little critical attention. For Abecassis, "the Cohen paradox" stems directly from the fact that the principle subject of Cohen's oeuvre was his ongoing reflection on the state of being a Jew in the modem world?a state that, for Cohen, was first and foremost a source of pain and tortured emotion. Antisemitism, Abecassis makes clear, is not the issue: Numerous writers of Jewish origins have made their way into the French literary canon. It is not Cohen's Jewishness that is disturbing; rather, it is the fact that "the catastrophe of being Jewish" was the source of his literary drive. 202</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Abecassis's study is intended as a corrective to the "French Republican" reading of Cohen, which has tended to ignore the centrality of his Jewishness to his oeuvre. Abecassis treats Cohen's work thematically, emphasizing the extent to which his fiction revolves around the same basic plot and characters?for example, Solal, a Greek Jew who moves to Europe, seduces and marries a Gentile woman, achieves great success but finds himself caught between the irreconcilable worlds of his Jewish relatives and the Europe to which he so desperately wants to belong, and is ultimately destroyed or self destructs. Ultimately, Abecassis concludes, it is Cohen's lack of a universalist message in his literary oeuvre that makes his full integration into the French literary canon impossible. The driving force behind all Cohen's fiction is the tragedy of being a Jew and the inability to merge one's French and Jewish identities, and as a result, "there are simply no grounds for his appropriation by or assimilation into the French collective conscience" [208]. Whereas Cohen's focus on the bleak, cata strophic aspect of Jewish identity has made his work impossible to read in Israel, Abecassis concludes, it is perhaps only in the United States, which is free of both an antisemitic heritage and a nationalist master narrative, that a frank reading of Cohen can begin. Abecassis's study is a welcome addition to the scholarship on both Albert Cohen and French Jews more generally. His central thesis?that Cohen's oeuvre has been misread and ignored within the French academy because its central theme of Jewish alienation in the modem world does not mesh with universalist French Republican culture?is on the mark, and Abecassis contributes to a growing dialogue about the difficulty that Jews and other minorities have had in reconciling their own ethnic, cultural, and religious particularisms in France, whose universal pretensions mask the specificity of its very particular age-old Christian culture. Abecassis is a literary scholar, and the book is first and foremost an analy sis of Cohen's oeuvre. However, his line of analysis necessarily takes him into the domain of history, and it is here that the book is weakest. Abecassis's bib liography does not include even the most basic books in twentieth-century French Jewish history, and he arbitrarily bases his discussion of how French Jewish identity functioned during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on Alain Finkielkraut's 1980 memoir, Le juif imaginaire. Oddly, the only historical study of French Jews that appears in the bibliography is Arthur Hertzberg 's 1968 book The French Enlightenment and the Jews, which Abecassis refers to as part of a "more positive tectonic shift" that has "already begun" (?) within the American academy (211). Evidently, Abecassis is unaware that since the publication of Hertzberg 's book close to forty years ago, a whole body of historical literature has been produced to question the notion that the history of French Jews from the Revolution through the mid-1930s can simply be told as the story of assimilation, as Jews sacrificed all public expressions of their Jewishness in exchange for acceptance as "universal" French citizens. Scholars such as Paula Hyman, Michel Abitbol, Pierre Birnbaum, to name only a few of the most glaring omissions in Abecassis's 203</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews bibliography, have explored the complex ways in which French Jews negotiated their commitment to Jewish particularism with the responsibilities, opportu nities, and quandaries that political emancipation and citizenship offered.1 Abecassis's lack of familiarity with contemporary scholarship on French Jewish history, in turn, leads him to offer too stark a portrait of Cohen as a tormen ted, lonely soul, stmggling impossibly to express his Jewish identity in a way that was completely at odds with the reigning "Israelite" mentality of his day. In fact, Cohen, who was active in the French Zionist movement and founded the Revue juive in 1925, was one of a growing number of French Jews who began question ing exactly the kind of assimilationist "Israelite" attitude that Abecassis mista kenly assumes was dominant within French Jewish circles in the interwar years. Although the rise in antisemitism in France during the 1930s, which paved the way for the horrors of the Vichy period, inevitably influenced Cohen's oeuvre, it is noteworthy that he began his literary career in the 1920s. During this period, antisemitism was at a low ebb, and French Jews felt a new sense of freedom to explore the complexity of Jewish identity in the modem world in the French public sphere. This period saw a flourishing of Jewish cultural life, with the creation of Jewish youth movements, Zionist-inspired associations and press organs, as well as new generation of French Jewish writers, including Cohen, who felt an unprecedented sense of freedom to tackle controversial issues such as antisemitism, assimilation, and intermarriage head on.
