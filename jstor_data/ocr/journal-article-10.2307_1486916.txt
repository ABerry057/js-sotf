Naples: Liguori, 1996. 308 pp. The essays in this volume were first published separately by Bonfil beginning in the late 1970s and into the early 1990s. They deal with three</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 267 basic themes of Italian Jewish life. First and most fully treated is the theme of Jewish culture in the Italian South between the ninth and eleventh centuries, from the Yossipon to the Megillat Ahimaaz, from what Bonfil calls the Babylonian hegemony to a new equilibrium between Babylonian, Palestinian, and local (Jewish) cultures and traditions. The second theme is Jewish-Christian relations in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance in an Italy which Bonfil interprets novelly, however much he calls the Italian Jewish experience unique. The third is the nature and function of Jewish historical writing in this period, and in discussing this Bonfil resumes his debate with H. Yerushalmi over the position he took in Zakhor He also repudiates the Burkhardtian vision of the Renaissance, in particular as it was elaborated by Cecil Roth, who painted a picture of felicitous harmony between the Jewish and Christian worlds. The unifying principle of these essays is well expressed by the title: Between Two Worlds. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the essays depict a complex portrait whose lines and images emerge in a series of dichotomies, to wit, between the cultures of Babylonia and Palestine, the cultures of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, the cultures of the Diaspora and the Land of Israel, the realms of myth and history, and the spheres of popular and learned cultures, of identity and acculturation, and of closure and openness. Through Bonfil's close attention to the details of these dichotomies, the whole becomes ever more sharply delineated, particulars are made to stand out, and the supposedly tried and true is rejected. The overall goal is to put to rest the old historiographical partition that viewed as distinct the internal and external stories of Jews living in a Christian society. Accordingly, Bonfil posits two principles of interpretation: first, that Jewish history must be pursued according to the same rules of evidence and interpretation applied to history as a whole, and, second-however much it seems to contradict the first-that there is a sharp cultural divide separating Christians from Jews, and Jews from Christians. To overcome this evident contradiction, Bonfil proposes that we must investigate the modalities of both the "presence" and the "absence" of Jews in the Christian world and, in particular, the mutual interpenetration of the two worlds, which one might call "absence in presence." Bonfil forcefully illustrates these themes of cultural clash in his discussion of the Italian South, where, in fact, a third cultural pole is brought to bear, that of Islam. Yet the fundamental opposition there was not between Jews and Christians or Muslims, but between Palestinian culture, anchored in</page><page sequence="3">268 BOOK REVIEWS venerated local practice, and the culture of the Babylonian Talmud. Bonfil describes this opposition in terms of direct challenge, acculturation, and the loss of tradition. The desire he perceives of Italian Jews to resist the supremacy of Baghdad, a desire also expressed by various Jewish communities under direct Islamic rule, is seen as most conservative and linked to common perceptions and mental structures shared by Italian Jewry with its Christian neighbors. Largely on the basis of the Megillat Ahimaaz, Bonfil describes a new equilibrium between Palestinian and Babylonian traditions reached in the eleventh century. The break with Babylonian hegemony and the independence of the Occident from the Orient was also expressed in terms of a new conception of the Land of Israel fueled by both myth and history: "The discourse of Ahimaaz reverberates with a new music of the diaspora, destined to continue through the beginning of modem times" (p. 132). The history of Italy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries offers Bonfil ample possibilities to investigate what he calls the primary oppositions of "openness" and "closure," invert meanings, and change the valence of signs; and he sets out determinedly to demolish the current historiographical vision of a process of "interrupted [social and intellectual] integration." Instead he speaks of a period of intellectual encounter between Christians and Jews, which had a social impact as well, but which was followed in the fifteenth century and afterward by a progressive exclusiveness. A principal cause of this closure was the disappearance of the scholastic culture that previously had furnished "the primary basis for the Jewish-Christian intellectual meeting" (p. 202). The loss of this common cultural base, together with a growing need for individual self-definition (which itself unequivocally derived from preexisting concepts) led to an ever-widening gap between the self and "the other." Only in a later period accompanied by an entirely new mentality produced by laicization would this process be reversed, a reversal that was anticipated nevertheless by the modalities of the previous period of closure. While using his sources to define the closure of the two worlds, Bonfil also uses them to demonstrate the link between closure and acculturation, an ever-present interchange, because "anti-biosis" (defined as the antithesis of symbiosis) produces acculturational phenomena no less intense than those of symbiosis. Examining epistolaries as indicators of the modes in which Jewish society perceived its own culture, Bonfil argues that for Jews, Christian society does not have a "real" existence; non-Jews are "accidental," not "necessary." On the other hand, through a process of constant Judaization,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 269 Jewish culture assimilates models of non-Jewish culture (the accent is heavily on high culture), beginning with language and extending to the form of the epistolary itself. Analogously, the Christian world appears fully disposed to accept and internalize Jewish values, yet equally disposed to have the Jews disappear (through conversion). Hence, if Jewish culture constantly fascinates and seduces Christian culture, Christian culture in its turn offers Jews alternative models of perception, which were indeed received and transformed through continuous interaction. In the process, the gap between the two kept widening and the sense of estrangement grew. A clear example of this process is the evolution of the idea of death among Jews from a negative to a positive one, an evolution whose initiation Bonfil attributes (although not representing unanimity on this point) to direct Christian influence in southern Italy in the tenth century, and which he views as a prelude to the full-blown Ashkenazic theory of Qiddush Ha-Shem during the Crusades. For Bonfil, then, there is no simple substitution of a black for a rosy image of the relationship between the "Two Worlds." What he wants to derail is the historiographical vision that distance necessarily implies closure or, conversely, that openness implies cultural symbiosis. In Bonfil's view, openness toward the culture of the other is primarily the other face of the coin of closure, a point he illustrates through the story of the Inquisitor who perceived Azariah de Rossi's intensive study of the Gospels as a sign that he was about to convert. De Rossi, in fact, saw his studying of the "other" as nothing of the kind. But Jewish exponents of the Haskalah, says Bonfil, not to mention Graetz or Cecil Roth-all three are targets of Bonfil's polemic-would not have understood this. Believing that "the conservation of national and cultural unity . . . implied a palpable acceptance of the need to reduce contacts with outside cultures" (p. 241), they would effectively have been performing the same mental operation as the Inquisitor mentioned above. Why representatives of nineteenth-century Orthodoxy are not included on Bonfil's list of opponents is not at all clear. It is a fascinating reconstruction, yet one with many still obscure and unresolved lines. Bonfil himself betrays the sources of difficulty in his brilliant, yet nevertheless unsatisfying portrait of Judah Messer Leon, a rabbi anything but liberal, a halakhically severe conservative, despite his openness to the outside world and its culture, whose products he intended solely to integrate and absorb into a Jewish cultural realm. Through the complex art of mirrors, of refusal, seduction, assimilation, and rejection, which these essays construct, we well perceive the insufficiency of older interpretations.</page><page sequence="5">270 BOOK REVIEWS At the same time, Bonfil's new interpretations, although compelling, remain enveloped in ambiguity and shadow.
