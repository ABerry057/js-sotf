Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990. xiii, 204 pp. Much as Buttercup warned the captain of H.M.S. Pinafore to beware of skim milk masquerading as cream, potential readers of this volume would do well to pay more attention to the series in which it appears than to the promise implied by its title. The term "Jew" is particularly misleading, espe- cially for those who would expect a discussion of medieval Hofjiiden. It is the biblical period with which this volume is concerned, and the books of Daniel and Esther in particular, to which over half of its pages are devoted, the vast majority to the former. Even that limited focus may suggest a broader agen- da than the book actually contains, since it is less interested in exploring the implications of the presence of Jews at the Babylonian and Persian courts than in analyzing the history of the Daniel and Esther traditions. Thus other relevant accounts command little attention; the story of Joseph is dismissed in just over a page, and Moses' confrontation with Pharaoh virtually ignored, except for one brief, if insightful, observation. What one finds instead is essentially a work of literary criticism in the 1. For a different view, see J. Kampen, The Hasideans and the Origin of Pharisaism: A Study in 1 and 2 Maccabees (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988), pp. 115-122.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 287 traditional sense of that term in the field of biblical studies. The author is primarily concerned to identify the sources of the narratives with which he deals and to trace the process of their development. For example, the story of Esther is followed from a "Mordecai-Haman Source" to an "Esther Source" that was modified into the hypothetical Vorlage of the Septuagint's A version before being translated into Greek and then redacted into the masoretic text. Even more complex is the tradition history of Daniel, presented here in a chapter-by-chapter format, which includes as well the development of the stories of Bel and Susanna. The book presents translations of several of the sources, using a variety of typefaces to indicate the stages of their develop- ment. Whether the author's conclusions are convincing is likely to depend as much on one's attitude toward this kind of study in the first place as on the actual arguments presented, some of which appear to be heavily subjective. For example, the sources of Esther are often determined on the basis of the author's attempt to create a coherent story. His observation that "the first nine verses [of Esther] can be summarized in four words: 'Ahasuerus gave a banquet"' (p. 157) leads him to conclude that everything else must have been added later. What makes all this particularly unfortunate is the intriguing possibili- ties suggested by the title and by programmatic statements scattered throughout the work. For example, at one point the body of material under study is described as "a corpus of legends about a cultural hero of a ruled minority ... which affirms the role of that minority in the ruling empire" (p. 150). In order to explore this possibility, an early chapter is devoted to court legends from various cultures, including Persia and Greece, but instead of comparing these traditions with the biblical material, the study quickly gives way to the detailed source analysis described above. The open- ing chapter, which considers various relevant literary genres, includes an insightful (if not clearly relevant) treatment of the so-called wisdom stories. Criticizing the interpretation of such material in much of biblical scholar- ship, the author observes that a story's social provenance should not be inferred from the fact that wisdom plays a role in it, since that may serve a variety of quite different purposes. But it is unclear how this observation, whatever its intrinsic merit, serves the broader purpose of the work. Occasionally, the author feels free enough to explore some of the direc- tions in which these traditions developed. In the case of Daniel, for example, a study of each component in the tradition now preserved in the Hebrew (and Greek) Bible leads him to observe that the original interest in the hero's</page><page sequence="3">288 BOOK REVIEWS ethnicity gave way over time to an increasing focus on piety, reflecting the changing needs and circumstances of the community in which these tradi- tions were preserved. This book would have been of wider interest and importance if such points played a more conspicuous and controlling role in its overall content. Equally unfortunate is the limited amount of discussion devoted to the relationship among the various stories treated here, whether genetic (as some have claimed, arguing that common themes and even phrases demon- strate a common source, whether biblical or otherwise) or thematic, a possi- bility rich in potential implications for our understanding of the ways in which biblical authors viewed their people's relationship to the foreign powers in whose midst they lived. Like skim milk, this study has much to offer those desiring such a pro- duct. Although it is likely to convince some readers more than others, it is a useful analysis of the history of two biblical texts (Esther and Daniel 1-6). Masquerading as cream, it raises the larger question posed in its title and alluded to suggestively throughout. However, the ramifications of that issue await a more insightful analysis. Frederick E.
