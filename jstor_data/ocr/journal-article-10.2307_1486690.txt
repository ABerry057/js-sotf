Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. 329 pp.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 217 As Benjamin Ish-Shalom correctly states at the conclusion of his study on Rav Avraham Itzhak HaCohen Kook, Rav Kook "never made explicit claim to propose an exhaustive philosophy, with definitive concepts and a systematic framework" (p. 235). In contrast, Ish-Shalom's volume is systematic in organization as well as lucid in structure, thus offering an excellent explication of the thought of Rav Kook, a religious philosophy which hovers, as is clearly demonstrated, "between rationalism and mysticism." Ish-Shalom's volume, divided into four parts, is a well-organized, contex- tualized study of the corpus of Rav Kook's writings. While part I describes aspects of Rav Kook's personal history, it emphasizes the political, cultural, and religious framework in which Rav Kook found himself after his aliyah as newly appointed chief rabbi of the New Yishuv in 1904. Especially interesting is the thorough discussion of the dispute in Jerusalem regarding the teaching of general studies, which resulted, in January 1934, in the opening of the Horev School without the approval of Agudat Israel of Jerusalem. Rav Kook, however, wrote explicitly that the heremn prohibiting general studies was harmful and went on to explain his reasons. Thus, at the very beginning of Ish-Shalom's book, the unique and unusual philosophy of Rav Kook is presented: a conservative rabbi of Eastern European roots with intellectual horizons as broad as those of the Maskilim. Rav Kook's entry into the debates about what a religious education in Palestine should consist of demonstrated his grappling with the more inclusive question of the meaning of religion in the modem world. At the beginning, then, we are introduced to the complex multifacetedness and practical implications of Rav Kook's religious thought. Having placed Rav Kook broadly within the intellectual currents and controversial issues of his times, Ish-Shalom devotes parts II and III to a thorough and specific analysis of the main philosophical components of Rav Kook's thought. Part II discusses epistemology, ontology, and the nuances of the concept of revelation, while part III deals with the complex categories of religion and freedom. It is in these sections that aspects of Rav Kook's mysticism are described and clarified. Ish-Shalom's discussions, especially the textual analyses, are interest- ing and illuminating. He shows how Rav Kook's understanding of divine inspiration, or "mystical perception," appears to follow Maimonides (see p. 260, n. 103), but rather than being exclusively cognitive and/or visual is characterized by an acoustical-even musical--quality (p. 56). Supreme holiness, Rav Kook maintains, necessarily includes three elements: "the return to nature, to human morality and to the element of nation" ('Orot ha-Qodesh,</page><page sequence="3">218 BOOK REVIEWS vol. 1, p. 279, quoted by Ish-Shalom on p. 56). The person graced with the gift of mystical perception is able to listen to the soul's harmony with nature; to hear the symphony growing out of seemingly disparate parts. The acoustical metaphor leads to several references to the "the laws of attentiveness" and "the light of supreme attentiveness," much in the way Simone Weil will later use these terms. Ish-Shalom's analyses of the terms "imagination," "feeling," and "intellect" as used by Rav Kook are excellent, bringing a variety of primary texts as justification for specific interpretations. These sections demonstrate clearly the blurring of the usual philosophical categories and definitions in Rav Kook's thought and his conceptual striving toward unity. The careful analyses of the concepts of revelation and self are especially significant in this regard, and structurally move toward the later discussions of the religious life, the meaning of holiness, and the all-encompassing embrace of freedom. Part IV, entitled "The Dynamic of Rationalism and Mysticism in Rav Kook's Thought," is the conceptual culmination of the three preceding sec- tions. I found it philosophically nuanced, subtle, and illuminating. Especially interesting is the way Ish-Shalom defines rationalism and mysticism, and in true Kookian fashion demonstrates their ideational continuum, if not, indeed, overlap. Rav Kook saw the task of delimiting the boundaries which separate rationalism and mysticism as extremely problematic, and construed such boundaries as relative rather than absolute (p. 180). This is, in a sense, to state the connection between deductive and inductive reasoning. Certainly cognizant of the pitfalls of extreme concern for details (a significant awareness for a posek), Rav Kook stressed the synthetic approach as a necessary complement and antidote to the analytic. Only in this way could human beings move toward the "perfection of the spiritual world" (p. 182), both individually and collectively. Especially noteworthy, considering the monolithic and often extreme halakhic and nationalistic views of Rav Kook's presumed disciples, is Ish-Shalom's brief discussion, in the afterword, of Rav Kook's understanding of "Torah from heaven." Related to the earlier analysis of revelation, Torah from heaven is seen to be a broad, dynamic, even organismic concept, rather than a narrow, literal, stagnant notion. Minor technical and conceptual flaws detract from an otherwise excellent volume. There are various typos and spelling errors (e.g., pp. 58, 96, 194) as well as the use of awkward, if not outrightly incorrect, adjectival and noun forms (e.g., "cogitation," p. 8; "utopic," pp. 227, 232; "Anarchistic," p. 236). There are also instances of awkward syntax perhaps deriving from the difficult task of translating a philosophical text, although the translation</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 219 is overall of high quality. I have two small but more serious complaints as a scholarly reader. First, the endnote pages should be headed, "Notes, pp. 6-19," i.e., they should include the specific pages of text to which each page of notes refers. This greatly facilitates reading and referencing, and is a simple thing to do. Second, I found the discussion of Ray Kook's relation to existentialism in the afterword problematic. Ish-Shalom overgeneralizes in his definition of existentialism (p. 234), failing, it seems to me, to take account of religious existentialists like Martin Buber and Gabriel Marcel. To state that in existentialism "morality gave way to nihilism" (p. 234) is surely an overly broad assertion, negated even by atheistic existentialists such as Camus. Ish-Shalom's study begins by describing a methodology carried through the volume with consistently excellent results (p. xiii) and concludes with a series of astute, forthright philosophical and theological questions (pp. 236-237) to carry the reader even further than the study itself. It is a well-organized, enlightening, and stimulating volume, of value to students of Zionism, philosophy, and religious mysticism. Rochelle L.
