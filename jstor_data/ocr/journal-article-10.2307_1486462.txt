<plain_text><page sequence="1">TAMAR, A SYMBOL OF LIFE: THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN THE BIBLE AND JEWISH TRADITION by MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN For Robert Gordis The "killer wife" superstition, by which we mean the belief that the hus- bands of certain women are doomed to die, is examined here as it appears in Jewish sources from the Bible to Maimonides. The many pertinent develop- ments in post-talmudic-midrashic sources require a separate study. For this period we confine our discussion to Maimonides, the most significant medieval spokesman on the subject. Our topic is a popular theme in folk- lore.' Here our primary interest is in how the religion of Israel reacted to the superstition, both conceptually and practically. 1. For an extensive discussion of the folkloristic theme in Jewish (and non-Jewish) sources and for references to additional literature, see H. Schwarzbaum, "The Hero Predestined to Die on His Wedding Day," in Studies in Marriage Customs, ed. I Ben-Ami and D. Noy, Folklore Research Center Studies, no. 4 (Jerusalem, 1974), pp. 223-252. In several variations of the theme, the wife is not the source of danger and actually saves her husband from his fate. 23</page><page sequence="2">24 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN 1. Women, Evil, and Death: Introductory Note "Women are a separate people," said the rabbis (B. Shabbat 62a). As in many male-dominated societies, the mysteriousness of women was consi- dered threatening by some of the talmudic sages. These men associated women with life-endangering demonic forces. "And He closed up [wayisgor] the flesh at the spot" [Gen. 2:21]. R. H.inena the son of R. Ada said: From the beginning of the book until here the letter samekh is not written. Once she [woman] was created, Satan was created with her. Why do women precede men in a funeral procession? He [R. Joshua] said to them: Because they brought death to the world. .... Why was she given the commandment of menstruation? Because she spilled the blood of the first man.2 The terrifying nature of the demonic forces associated with women is per- haps most forcefully expressed in the following passage: R. Joshua b. Levi said: The angel of death told me ... "Do not stand before the women when they return from a funeral procession, because I dance in front of them. My sword is in my hand, and I have the power to smite."3 With the exception of Gen. 38, discussed below, the attribution of dia- bolic forces to women is apparently absent in the Bible. The tone is set in Gen. 3:20. Both the midrash and modern scholarship suggest that the 2. Satan: Bereshit Rabba 17:6, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 157. Cf. M. M. Kasher, Torah She- lemah, 2:241, no. 276.

Rivlin [Israel, 5746], pp. 19-20: "The sword of the angel of death is Lilith, who entices man, then takes his soul.") On the motif of the angel of death's sword, see now M. B. Lerner, "Collected Exempla" [Heb.], Kiryat Sefer 61 (1986-87): 883 ff.</page><page sequence="3">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 25 etymology of Eve (rnn) may be from a word meaning "snake" (as Aramaic Maln).4 But it is explained by the Bible as "because she was the mother of all living things." If the snake etymology is correct, the story can be assumed to contain an older, folk stratum in which primeval woman herself was asso- ciated with the serpent, the symbol of Satan (and death)-as in the previous- ly cited rabbinic statements and some later non-Jewish interpretations of the story. The biblical narrator, I assume, was familiar with the tradition. In effect, he can be seen as having reworked the tale. By supplying a "correct" explanation of the meaning of Eve's name, he "exorcised" the demon from woman and identified her with motherhood as the source of life. Man was punished for having disobeyed God's command. We thus are taught that sin, not the snake, the devil, or woman, causes man's death.5 This is, of course, not the only explanation of death (and suffering) found in the Bible. The Bible and later Jewish literature are not monolithic, and from the outset, it should be made clear that our analysis is offered for only the specific biblical and postbiblical passages considered here. The same must be said concerning the way in which we read these texts. Our interpretation of biblical (and some postbiblical) sources closely follows some of the methodology of Y. Kaufmann (see n. 5). As is well known, his understanding of the Bible's attitude to paganism and the role of a primor- dial realm of forces associated with it, in contrast to the religion of Israel, has not won universal acceptance.6 But no serious critic will disavow its 4. The "snake" etymology appears in Bereshit Rabba 20:11, p. 195: "R. Aha said: 'The snake is your snake; you are man's snake.' " Cf. L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 7 vols. (Philadelphia, 1955), 5:91, n. 48. (Note that according to the talmudic sages [B. Sanhedrin 38b], primeval man spoke Aramaic.) It has been adopted by modern scholars as well. See U. Cas- suto, From Adam to Noah [Heb.], 3rd ed. (Jerusalem, 1959), pp. 113-114. Cf. F. Zimmermann, "Folk Etymology of Biblical Names," Supplements to Vetus Testamentum 15 (1966): 316-318, and C.

Greenberg (Chicago, 1960), pp. 292-295. Cf. Urbach, The Sages, pp. 371-384. Note, e.g., M. Rosh Hashana 3:8: "Does the snake kill or does the snake revive?"; B.

FRIEDMAN total applicability to all texts. The issues studied in this paper may be repre- sentative of broader trends in biblical and postbiblical religion; we limit our- selves to the phenomenon under discussion and will not try to prove more comprehensive implications. Also beyond the scope of this paper are the notions within Judaism that women in general are associated with the devil or with the evil inclination. Here we examine the bizarre belief that some women are the sources of their own husbands' deaths, even though they appeared to have died from natural causes: the "killer wife." 2. The "Killer Wife" Superstition in the Bible The "killer wife" superstition appears in the patriarchal stories in Gen. 38. This chapter has been discussed extensively in recent years, but little attention has been paid to this motif. J. Skinner, for example, writes: "This motif appears to have been introduced simply to provide a background to the main part of the story." And according to J. A. Emerton, "Whether the motif of the slaying of Er and Onan was an adaption of that of the demon murderer of husbands [see below, sec. 3], cannot be more than a matter of speculation which is of little value for the study of the story of Judah and Tamar." As we are here interested in studying this very motif, this literature is of little value for our purposes.7 The names of the main characters of the story appear to be symbolic, and they could have been understood as setting the stage for the action. Judah's daughter-in-law is Tamar ("date palm"), a symbol of fertility. She times, they were not considered threatening to monotheism. Sperling's argument against Kauf- mann's biblical hypothesis includes the point that "pious Jews who lived in the period of late antiquity, who were surely more consistent monotheists than their Israelite ancestors, did not object to the use of incantations . .. recognized the legitimacy of many kinds of divination" (pp. 19-21), thus basing himself on an alternative hypothesis. 7. J. Skinner, The Interpreter's Bible, 1:757. J. A. Emerton, "Some Problems in Genesis XXXVIII," Vetus Testamentum 25 (1975): 355. See the literature on Gen. 38 reviewed by Emer- ton in that article (pp. 338-361) and in two other articles, ibid., 26 (1976): 79-98 and 29 (1979): 403-415. Cf., e.g., S. Niditch, "The Wronged Woman Righted: An Analysis of Genesis 38," Harvard Theological Review 72 (1979): 143-149. Much of this literature deals primarily with the authors' reconstructions of the text rather than the biblical text itself; cf., e.g., G. R. H. Wright, "The Positioning of Genesis 38," Zeitschrift fiir die Altetestamentliche Wissenschaft 94 (1982): 523-529, where it is suggested that underlying the story is a myth whose heroine was trans- formed into a palm tree.</page><page sequence="5">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 27 is married first to Er-compare rw ,i ("childless"), then to Onan (possibly from p~, "of naught").8 Gen. 38:6 ff (6) Judah got a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar. (7) But Er, Judah's firstborn, was displeasing to [lit. evil in the sight of] the Lord, and the Lord took his life. (8) Then Judah said to Onan, "Join with your brother's wife and do your duty by her as a brother-in-law and provide offspring for your brother." (9) But Onan, knowing that the seed would not count as his, let it go to waste whenever he joined with his brother's wife, so as not to provide offspring for his brother. (10) What he did was displeasing to [lit. evil in the sight of] the Lord, and He took his life also. (11) Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Stay as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"-for he thought, "He too might die like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house. The tension between the conflicting yet connected forces of life and death is predominant throughout the story. The tragedy of Er's dying with- out children is to be ameliorated by Onan's performing the levirate (see Deut. 25:5-10) with Tamar "and providing offspring," that is, a measure of immortality, for him.9 Onan refuses to fulfill this obligation, and he too dies. 8. I am not arguing that these explanations necessarily correspond to the "historical" etymologies of the names. Other reasonable ones have been offered, and the matter is not central to our thesis. "Er" is explained in Bereshit Rabba 85:4, p. 1037, as "emptied from this world" ([n]iYrn). Targum Yerushalmi I (Pseudo-Jonathan) (ed. Reider, pp. 58-59): "She called his name Er because he would die without children." Cf. Kasher, Torah Shelemah, 6:1447, no. 23 and the sources cited there; Zimmermann, "Folk Etymology of Biblical Names," pp. 322-323; M. Garsiel, Midrashic Name Derivations in the Bible [Heb.] (Ramat Gan, 1987), p. 147. "Onan" is explained by the midrash as a reference to mourning . In Bereshit Rabba 85:4: "he caused mourning for himself." See Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 5:333, n. 79; Torah Shelemah, loc. cit., and the sources cited there in the comment to no. 24. On our suggested derivation from paK, cf. Garsiel, p. 133. Besides "naught" awen could mean "evil, fraud." Cf. "conceiving wrong and begetting evil" in Isa. 59:4, Ps. 7:15, and Job 15:35. Zimmermann, p. 323: "the unfortunate one." Midrash Haggadol on the Pentateuch, Genesis [Heb.], ed. M. Mar- gulies, reprint ed. (Jerusalem, 1975), p. 644, attributes Tamar's name to "her stately form like a palm." This is obviously a reference to Song of Songs 7:8 and accordingly reflects Tamar's sex appeal. (Cf. the connection with Ishtar suggested by J. Skinner, A Critical and Exegetical Com- mentary on Genesis, 2nd ed. [Edinburgh, 1963], p. 452.) Zimmermann (p. 323) takes Shelah to mean here "deprived of a name" (cf. below, n. 53). 9. See Urbach, The Sages, pp. 453-454; cf. M. B. Lerner, "The Story of the Tanna and the Ghost" [Heb.], Asuppot 2 (1988): 50-51.</page><page sequence="6">28 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN Tamar, by bearing a child, was to have provided life for the dead; but Judah blames her for his sons' deaths. In the end, she triumphs. Through her dar- ing and resolution she tricks her father-in-law into providing her with his own seed. Judah is not aware of Tamar's identity during their liaison, and upon learning of her pregnancy he orders her execution. When he realizes what has happened, the execution is canceled. Tamar lives and gives birth to twins, Zerah and Perez, the ancestor of King David. Judah's belief that Tamar might be the cause of his two sons' deaths is clearly implied in verse 11 ("for he thought, 'He too might die like his brothers'"). Tamar is sent away from his home, not, as he professes, until Shelah comes of age, but in order to remove her as a threat to the life of his only remaining son.10 His resort to deception is a significant point in the narrative as far as the belief in the "killer wife" is concerned. While he recognizes the potential danger she poses, it is not evident to Tamar (or her family). And obviously there is no prohibition against her marrying a third time (or performing the levirate)." Judah's deception is balanced by Tamar's. She disguises herself as a har- lot and tricks Judah into having intercourse with her. Later he admits that she was "more in the right than I" (v. 26). This portion of the narrative closes in verse 26 with the remark: "And he was not intimate with her 10. A curious modern parallel to the Tamar story, with the same elements of the levirate and the "killer wife" superstition, can be cited from a report from the Arab village of Artas, south of Bethlehem. There women called qashra are believed to be possessed by an evil spirit which causes the death of their husbands. When Jamile entered Ibrahim's house, he became pale and died in forty days. Jamile was considered a qashra and returned to her father's home. Mahmid, Ibriim's brother, would not marry Jamile, as he "was afraid the same thing would happen to him." But he was in love with her, and he changed his mind. Special measures were taken on their wedding day to avert the evil from him. He lived with Jamile four years, had a son, and then died. Jamile then asserted "that she would even marry the third brother in spite of his mother, her mother-in-law." She died before she could carry out her intention, sup- posedly a punishment for having sworn a false oath. (H. Granqvist, Marriage Conditions in a Palestinian Village, vol. 2 [Helsingfors, 1935], pp. 307-309.) 11. Nahmanides' challenge to Rashi, in his comment to v. 11, is based on the anachronistic assumption that the talmudic law was common knowledge to the patriarchs: "Rashi wrote, 'He pushed her aside with a straw [found an excuse for removing her], because he did not intend to give her in marriage to him [Shelah], "for he thought, he too might die like his brothers," since she had the status of a woman whose husbands die.' But I do not know why Judah, the ruler of his generation, should be embarassed by this woman and not tell her, 'Go in peace from my house' and why he should deceive her, since she was forbidden to Shelah, as they said, 'in marriage two times is a precedent.'"</page><page sequence="7">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 29 again." Tamar succeeds in being reinstated in her father-in-law's home. Why then is her relationship with Judah a onetime affair? The usual expla- nation maintains that Judah wants to avoid incest with his daughter-in- law.12 Some scholars have suggested that, as in Hittite Code 193 and Middle Assyrian Laws 33, the levirate could be performed among the ancient Israel- ites not only by a brother but also by the father. The relationship was ter- minated, however, after the widow had a child and offspring was thus pro- vided for the dead man." Judah's refraining from further intimacy with Tamar could likewise be explained by his fear of contact with her as a "killer woman."'14 The Bible specifies (vv. 7, 10) that both Er and Onan die, or rather their lives are taken by the Lord, because they or their actions are evil in His sight. Onan's evil is described in verse 9 as his failure to fulfill the levirate obligation by practicing coitus interruptus (onanism); and this explains why the Lord takes his life. But Er's sin is not defined. For what evil does he die? 12. So Jubilees 41:23; Testament of Judah 12:9; Siphre d'be Rab (Numbers), ed. H. S. Horo- vitz (Leipzig, 1917 [reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1966]), Beha'alotkha, sec. 88, p. 87. 13. For MAL and Hittite levirate, see A. Skaist, "Levirat," Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archaeologie (Berlin, 1983), 6:605-608. For Judah's role, note that according to the midrash (Bereshit Rabba 85:5, 8-10, pp. 1038, 1041-1043, and parallels), Judah's affair with Tamar was predestined. (Also cf. B. Yevamot 20b: "If they were intimate, the acquisition is effective with the first act of intercourse, but they may not have intercourse a second time.") Cf., e.g., Abraham Maimonides in his commentary to Gen. 38:13-14, quoting his grandfather (Perush R. Avraham b. Ha-Rambam z"l 'al Bereshit u-Shemot, ed. E. J. Weis- senberg [London, 1958], pp. 144-145); Nabmanides' commentary to Gen. 38:8, 26 ("Once he had provided offspring for his sons, he no longer wanted to be with her"); Gersonides' com- mentary (Venice, 1546/47), p. 44d; A. B. Ehrlich, Miqra ki-Pheschuto (Berlin, 1899), 1:105; M. D. (U.) Cassuto, "The Story of Tamar and Judah," in Siyyunim: Y N.

Heim, and C. A. Moore (Philadelphia, 1974), p. 249. Note that the Spanish Muslim author Ibn Hazm (d. 1064) also wrote that Judah performed the levirate with Tamar (cited by H. Lazarus- Yafeh, Tarbiz 55 [1986]: 373, n. 59). 14. This was suggested in the commentaries of Joseph Bekhor Shor (reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1978), p. 64; Hezekiah ben Manoah (Hizzekuni, Jerusalem, 1981), p. 147; and Gersonides (pp. 44d-45b). (Abrabanel, on the other hand, takes v. 26a as Judah's admission that Tamar was not to blame for his sons' deaths, since she had conceived by him. The comments of Bekhor Shor, Ben Manoah, and Gersonides correspond with the later talmudic belief in the "killer wife," viz., that the danger was not dependent on the length of the marriage or the number of contacts. Abrabanel's corresponds with the Tobit story, where the danger is present in the first act of intimacy. Cf., e.g., Sefer Hasidim's interpretation of B. fullin 95b, below in sec. 4.)</page><page sequence="8">30 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN The talmudic sages sensed that something is missing here, and the midrash supplied Er's sin: he too performed coitus interruptus.'5 But the biblical text provides no basis for this or any other specific sin. The question then should be redefined. If Er's sin is not specified, why is it mentioned at all? Perhaps hundreds of deaths are spoken of in the Bible. Rarely is the cause of death defined, and it is most unusual to find a reason for what we would consider a natural death. Where one is supplied the narrator had a particular purpose for doing so. Just such a case is Num, 27:3, where the daughters of Zelophehad say, "Our father died in the wilder- ness. He was not one of the faction, Korah's faction, which banded together against the Lord, but died for his own sin; and he has left no sons." Here the reason for saying that Zelophehad "died of his own sin" is self-evident, even though the sin is not specified. His daughters thereby emphasized that his death was not connected with Korah's faction, and there was no reason to withhold his estate. The statement that Er "was evil in the Lord's sight, and the Lord took his life," with no obvious explanation supplied by the narra- tor, is, I believe, without parallel in the Bible. Nabmanides, who, unlike the talmudic sages, did not invent a sin for Er, felt it necessary to explain its mention, even though his explanation (to instruct us that Er did not die as punishment for Judah's involvement in Joseph's sale [contrary to B. Sofa 13b]) cannot be accepted as the simple meaning of the text.16 The passage contains two separate explanations of Er's and Onan's deaths: the omniscient narrator's, namely, that God took their lives because of their sins, and Judah's, that Tamar was somehow responsible and that Shelah's life would be endangered by marrying her. These explanations are clearly mutually exclusive. The reader is undoubtedly expected to accept that of the narrator. I suggest that the narrator "revealed" the cause of Er's 15. P. Ketubbot 7:5, 31b and parallels. See Torah Shelemah, 6:1449, no. 32; 6:1450, nos. 34, 35, and references there. Er abstained from relations with Tamar according to Testament of Judah 10:2-3 and Jubilees 41:2. (Also cf. the sources quoted by M. Beer, Zion 53 [1988]: 152, n. 13.) 16. "Evil in the Lord's sight" occurs only rarely in the Bible and refers (usually) to grave sins for which God takes one's life or for which one deserves to die. Cf. Gen. 13:13 concerning Sodom; II Sam. 11:27, David's sin with Bathsheba; cf. I Chron. 21:7 (Isa. 59:15, Prov. 24:18). As to explaining the deaths of Er and Onan, S. Yeivin ("The Beginnings of the Davidids" [Heb.], Zion 9 [1944]: 60), for example, takes it as a reference to the disappearance of certain intermarried Judean-Canaanite clans.</page><page sequence="9">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 31 death for this reason and that this is at least one of the purposes in speaking of Onan's sin. Accordingly, the story may be seen as composed of (at least) two strata.'7 (The phenomenon of a divine or "religious" explanation appended to the human understanding of events occurs elsewhere in the Bible. Cf. Judg. 14:4: "His father and mother did not realize that this was the Lord's doing: He was seeking a pretext against the Philistines," etc.)'8 The original tale-or, at least, Judah's version-explained the deaths of Er and Onan by the "killer wife" superstition. The exact nature of the supersti- tion is not defined, but it evidently is based on a belief that man's destiny may be controlled by malevolent, irrational forces, here associated with women. By identifying the cause of their deaths as sin, the omnisicient nar- rator informs us of Judah's error. I hold that the mutual exclusiveness of the two explanations of the deaths of Er and Onan-Judah's, that Tamar was to blame, and the narra- tor's, that God took their lives because of their sins-is self-evident. Some medieval commentators noticed the contrast between the two, but they either left it without interpretation or attempted harmonization (see n. 17). Inexplicably, modern scholars seem to have overlooked it. The novelty of our interpretation may warrant an examination of different possibilities as to the rationale behind the narrator's explanation, which we undertake at the risk of some tediousness. In the absence of other evidence, one might hypothetically assume-with Nalhmanides, for example-that the narrator shared Judah's belief that certain women did cause the deaths of their hus- bands but disagreed as to Tamar's status. But if so, what would be the pur- pose of informing us that Tamar did not fall into that category? For "his- torical accuracy" or to purge King David's progenitor from a blemish? Neither seems a particularly convincing explanation. The story unequivo- cally supports the levirate commandment. Would not the levirate's primacy have been enhanced if the Bible had affirmed that Tamar had caused the 17. The contrast between the two is implicit in Nahmanides' attempt to reconcile them in his comment to v. 11: "It is unlikely that Judah did not hear that his sons had sinned and 'He dispatched them for their transgression' [Job 8:4], and Tamar had no sin [i.e., was not to blame] for them," etc. Cf. Abraham Maimonides, Commentary to Gen. 38:11 (Weissenberg ed.), pp. 144-145 and n. 13 there (see below, sec. 5). 18. Similar phenomena of "double causality" in the Bible, the human and the divine, are studied by I. L. Seeligmann, "Menschliches Heldentum und gottliche Hilfe: Die doppelte Kausalitat im alttestamentlichen Geschichtsdenken," Theologische Zeitschrift 19 (1963): 385-411. (I am indebted to Prof. G. Brinn for this reference.)</page><page sequence="10">32 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN deaths of her first two husbands but the Lord had protected her levir for having fulfilled his obligation? (See below, sec. 5, where the tension between the "killer wife" belief and the levirate is considered by Maimonides.) Alternative explanations may yet be offered, but I prefer to view the narrator's remarks that Er and Onan died because of their sins not as intended to inform us only that Tamar was not a "killer wife" but as a general statement of opposition to the belief that there are such women. Women do not bear a curse. They are not possessed by evil spirits which cause the deaths of their husbands. Israelite religion-as manifested in Gen. 38-rejected this pagan superstition. Death is not caused by diabolic forces or evil spirits. Willful sin causes death. When one is evil in God's sight, He takes one's life. Thus interpreted, the narrative reinforces the lesson of the Garden of Eden story. Here too the Bible "exorcises" the evil spirit which superstition had attributed to some women. Women are sources of life, not death.19 3. The Second Temple Period, Sectarian Literature Second Temple literature interprets the Judah episode in a way that exonerates Tamar of any guilt. The prophet whose words are brought in Mal. 2:11-12 rebukes the people for intermarrying. (11) For Judah has profaned what is holy to the Lord-what He desires-and espoused daughters of alien gods. (12) May the Lord leave to him no descendants dwelling in the tents of Jacob and presenting offerings to the Lord of Hosts. The Hebrew original for what has been rendered (in the new JPS translation) "descendants," nmai ny, has perplexed generations of commen- tators. The midrash explains these verses as concerning Judah's "sin" in marrying a Canaanite, the daughter of Shua, and mi; i n as referring to his sons IlK1 n. It is likely that this was in fact intended in the biblical passage.20 19. Cf. S. D. Goitein, Bible Studies [Heb.] (Tel-Aviv, 1957), p. 34: "The story of Tamar and Judah comes to teach us that a woman may acquire at any expense her natural right to mother- hood"; cf. ibid., p. 56. 20.

The deaths of Er and Onan were the result of Judah's marrying a Canaanite woman. Tamar, being an Aramean, was a proper match for Judah's son. But his own wife wanted her sons to marry a Canaanite like herself. Because of his mother's influence, Er treated Tamar cruelly. He avoided sleeping with her, so as not to procreate, and was killed by the Lord's angel on the third night of the marriage. Onan did the same for a year until Judah in- sisted that he have relations with her. He performed coitus interruptus and died because of his sins. Contrary to the biblical narrative, Judah did want to give Tamar in marriage to Shela, but his wife restrained him from doing so. The "killer wife," while expunged from the Tamar story, reappears in full force in the literature of the Second Temple period. Sarah the daughter of Reuel, the heroine of the apocryphal Book of Tobit, has already been widowed seven times when introduced. Each husband died in the wedding chamber. Her maidservants say she will never keep a husband, and they suggest that she commit suicide. At this point Tobias, Sarah's cousin, arrives on the scene. His angelic traveling companion, Raphael, urges him to marry Sarah. Since he is her only (or closest) relative, she is intended for him. Tobias does not take to this suggestion, as he is an only son and is fully aware of what happened to Sarah's first seven husbands. When he finally does propose to Reuel, the latter tries to dissuade the boy. After all, he is a cousin, and Reuel does not want to be responsible for his death. Tobias insists, and the marriage ceremony is performed. When the bride and groom enter the wedding chamber, Reuel has a grave dug, so that Tobias can be buried quickly and quietly. At this point we must mention a unique aspect of the fable. The author makes no secret about the actual cause of the deaths. The demon Ashmedai (= Asmodeus) is in love with Sarah and cannot bear anyone being intimate with her. As soon as each of her grooms approaches her, Ashmedai slays him. How does Tobias escape this fate? Simple. Raphael supplies him with the heart and liver of a fish. It seems that demons cannot stand the smell of burning fish hearts and livers. Tobias places them on a censer; and when Ashmedai inhales the odor, he flees from Persia, where all of this takes place, to the distant recesses of Upper Egypt. Tobias and Sarah pray to God and beg for His mercy. Tobias is spared, and the couple lives happily ever after. The story brings three or four separate elements into play in explaining</page><page sequence="12">34 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN the deaths of Sarah's first seven husbands and Tobias' deliverance from calamity. Besides the demon, endogamy is an important theme. The author stresses the significance of marrying within the extended family. Sarah's first husbands were strangers; her marriage to Tobias, her cousin, is predestined. Furthermore, after the demon is driven off, the couple pray to God for mercy, and Tobias affirms that he is not taking Sarah only to have sex with her but in truth (i.e.; for procreation). Tobias seemingly owes his life to a magical exorcism rite, the predestination of his endogamous marriage, prayer, and the purity of his intentions for reproduction. We are unable to ascertain when and how these diverse elements were combined. I consider it likely that the author "judaized" an older folktale where the demon theme alone appeared-it is still the dominant one-by adding the motifs of endogamy (which was for him a commandment of paramount importance), prayer, and procreation. The fact that the demon is in love with Sarah is mentioned in 6:15 in the shorter version, Codex Vati- canus, and absent in the longer Codex Sinaiticus. Y. M. Grintz, who identi- fied endogamy as the main theme, suggests that the demon's love is a later intrusion in Codex Vaticanus. In my view it is an integral part of the primary motif and was so understood in Codex Sinaiticus, even though not explicitly mentioned. In any event, according to both versions, there is no question but that Ashmedai takes a most active, independent role in the death of Sarah's husbands, and Tobias' life depends on removing him by magic.2' Did the "killer wife" superstition persist in the popular religion of Israel, despite the attempt of the narrator of Gen. 38 to eradicate it (suggested in sec. 2), or was it reintroduced in Judaism as a foreign element during the Second Temple period? The question has larger implications related to the nature of the popular religion during the biblical period, but these are 21. D. Heller, ed., "Sefer Toviah," in Ha-Sefarim ha-IHitzonim, ed. A.

A seven-time widow is the subject of a question which the Sadducees asked Jesus in a well-known passage in the Christian Bible. If, through ful- fillment of the levirate, a woman married seven brothers and was widowed successively from each, whose wife would she be at resurrection? Jesus responded that in the world-to-come there would be no marriage.23 No indication is made of the supposed cause of death of this woman's husbands. I do not think it unreasonable to speculate that their number, seven, may be an indication that their deaths were not believed to be from "natural" causes. 4. Talmudic and Midrashic Literature The superstition appears in a number of passages in talmudic and midra- shic literature. These as well as its absence where expected are discussed here. a. T. Shabbat 15:8 "If a woman married one man and he dies, and a second and he dies, she does not marry a third." These are Rabbi's words. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says, "She does not marry a fourth."24 It is clear from this beraita that at the end of the tannaitic period (some of) the sages believed in the "killer wife" superstition. Their innovation was to define the number of times a woman could be widowed before being assumed to belong to this category, and, more significantly to restrict her from remarrying and so protect the lives of prospective husbands. Rabbi (Judah ha-Nasi) and his father R. Simeon b. Gamaliel disputed the exact 22. See Kaufmann, Religion of Israel, pp. 122 ff. 23. Matt. 22:23-33, Mark 12:18-34, Luke 20:27-40. 24. Ed.

Ketubbot 62b, on the death of Rabbi's son's bride-to-be the parties believed that the match might have been "disqualified" by something in their family histories.) "She does not marry" or literally, in the passive, "she is not married" implies that the widow's remarriage is forbidden and that the sages were not simply giving sound advice here (that would probably have been worded "one should not marry," etc., ... inv envx DK KtV nK S). All other uses of xK K'nn in the Mishnah and the Tosefta clearly refer to forbidden marriages.26 b. B. Yevamot 64b The amora Abbaye (Babylonia, fourth generation) relies on a report that R. Yo1hanan instructed parents to circumcise (on a Yom Kippur which fell on a Shabbat) a baby boy whose two brothers had died after circumcision, and he concludes that a precedent is not presumed until after three occur- rences. He thereupon marries Homa, the daughter of Isi b. R. Isaac b. R. Judah, after she had already been widowed from her first two husbands. The Talmud adds that Abbaye himself died after marrying her (there is no indi- 25. According to the anonymous gemara in B. Yevamot 64b, some reverse the names of Rabbi and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel here. But elsewhere when the two dispute the number of times which are considered a precedent, Rabbi says two, and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, three. Besides our case (sources in the preceding note), there is the case of circumcision: After how many baby boys have died from circumcision does a family stop circumcising its sons? (T. Shab- bat 15:8; B. Yevamot 64b, where a report is cited in the name of R. Yohanan that R. Simeon b. Gamaliel ruled in such a case that a fourth baby should not be circumcised.) (Fo folktales on evil forces which threaten a baby at circumcision, see Schwarzbaum, "The Hero Predestined to Die," p. 224, n. 6; cf. J. Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition [New York, 1939], pp. 170 ff.) P. Yevamot 6:6, 7d, cites a number of beraitot which differ on whether a precedent is assumed after two or three times. These concern a woman who stains as a result of intercourse (after a precedent has been set she may not engage in intercourse), the circumcision case, and the right of a woman to collect her ketubba after a number of marriages which did not produce offspring. All the beraitot are anonymous, and the Yerushalmi does not identify them with Rabbi or R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. The Yerushalmi suggests that the tanna who rules that a bar- ren woman not collect her ketubba from her fourth marriage may agree that the third son not be circumcised, because of the danger to his life. Note also T. Yevamot 8:6 (p. 26): after three marriages which produce no offspring a woman does not remarry; but in B. Yevamot 65a: after two, she does not remarry. See S. Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, 6:72. B. Yevamot 64b-65a also identifies Rabbi with M. Sanhedrin 9:5 (punishment of a three-time offender [cf. T. San- hedrin 12:7-8]) and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel with M. Nidda 9:10 (regular menstrual period fixed after three times) and M. Bava Qamma 2:4. Also cf. B. Bava Mezia 106b and I10b. 26. M. Bikkurim 1:5; Yevamot 2:9, 15:5, 7; T.

Rava (Abbaye's contemporary) exclaimed, "Does one act on a case on himself?" That is, one does not endanger his own life (cf. Rashi) where there is room for doubt. (Rava's own wife, R. Hisda's daughter, had been widowed from her first husband; see B. Bava Batra 12b. The irony of H.oma's name, which means "Wall," is too striking to ignore here. The sages taught that a wife serves as a wall for her husband, i.e., she protects him [from sin]. In giving her this name, .Homa's scholarly family must have intended a prayer-nomen est omen-that she would be blessed by becoming a protectress for a suitable husband.)27 The Talmud then cites two opinions as to the cause of the deaths of the husbands of the "killer wife." R. Mordechai tells R. Ashi that Avimi of Hag- ronia reported in the name of Rava:28 "The well [in her womb]29 is the 27. B. Yevamot 62b: "R. Tanbum said in the name of R. Hanilai, 'A man without a wife lives without joy, without blessing, and without good.' ... In the West [Eretz Israel] they say, 'Without Torah and without a wall [bIoma].' " Maharsha comments: "One's wife protects him from sin and the war with the evil inclination." Note, however, that the name appears with slightly different spellings; see The Babylonian Talmud with Variant Readings ... Kethuboth, ed. M. Hershler, vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 1977), p. 100, n. 19. Shulhan Arukh, Even ha-'Ezer 129:34, cites Homa as an example of a woman's Hebrew name. (Rabenu Abraham of Montpellier, Commen- tary on the Tractate Yevamoth [Heb.], ed. M. Y. Blau [New York, 1962], p. 151: 1rtin, but this apparently is an error: nvin appears in the continuation.) This was Abbaye's second marriage, and he seems to have been much older than Homa. See A. Hyman, Toldoth Tannaim Ve'Amo- raim, vol. 1 (reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1987), pp. 86-87; cf. J. L. Maimon, "On Abbaye's Biography" [Heb.], in Sefer ha- Yovel le-Rabbi Hanokh Albeck (Jerusalem, 1963), pp. 320-321 (= J. L. Maimon, Abbaye and Rava [Heb.] [Jerusalem, 1965], p. 20). (R. Gordis suggests [in a private communication] that the sages may have called this woman Homa ["Wall"] because of her inaccessibility-as in Song of Songs 8:9-as proven by the deaths of her husbands.) 28. The printed edition has R. Huna, and the text is so quoted by, e.g., Nalhmanides, Responsa, no. 121. But elsewhere R. Mordechai is found transmitting traditions from Avimi of Hagronia to R. Ashi not in R. Huna's name but in Rava's. Accordingly, Ch. Albeck (Introduc- tion to the Talmud, Babli and Yerushalmi [Heb.] [Tel-Aviv, 1969], p. 403) prefers here the vari- ant "Rava" found in the Munich Codex (95). "Rava" appears in other manuscripts, including Geniza fragments, as well as in texts quoted by RID and Meiri; see The Babylonian Talmud with Variant Readings.. . Tractate Yebamoth, ed. A.

Nabmanides (Responsa, no. 121) cites the Gemara with npn, which means the same and may be his paraphrase (cf. R. Asher, Responsa 53:8). The text quoted by RID (see preceding note), pt ("sin"), if not a scribal error, is likely to be a "cor- rection" rather than a true variant.

FRIEDMAN cause," i.e., death results from sexual contact. R. Ashi (sixth generation) said, "Fate [mazzal, determined by the planets] is the cause."30 (It hardly seems coincidental that in one of the other five talmudic passages where R. Mordechai informs R. Ashi of Rava's teachings transmitted by Avimi of Hagronia, B. Bava Mezia 97a, this consists of an aphorism: "If a man is killed by women, there is no judge or judgment." [Its alternative uses there are explained by the commentators as referring to a man who does battle with women or engages in excessive sex with them.]) The significance of these explanations is discussed below (in sec. f). The sugya adds in the name of Rava31 (who interprets R. Joseph) that in matters of marriage the law concerning sequences is according to Rabbi. Consequently, being twice widowed constitutes a precedent; and the woman does not remarry.32 30. But Rava himself says (B. Moed Qatan 26a) that "life, children, and sustenance do not depend on merit but on fate [mazzal]." (See an example of Rava's concern for his own mazzal when sick in B. Nedarim 40a.) Might R. Ashi be transmitting a tradition of Rava here? (But see Albeck, Introduction to the Talmud, pp. 428-429.) The connection between the two is implicit in R. Asher's explanation of "fate is the cause" in B. Yevamot 64b (Responsa, no. 53:8): "The woman has the bad luck [mazzal] that her husbands die. This thing depends on fate, for one's life and sustenance depend on fate, if one is born in an hour whereby he should be wealthy or poor. A woman is secluded in her house, and she would be unable to earn her own livelihood were her husband not to sustain her. It is decreed that this woman's husbands die, in order that she live in poverty all her life, without anyone to sustain her. . . . But one cannot interpret that she was born in an astrological sign [mazzal] which causes her husband's death. . ... For we find in the Talmud only that wealth or poverty or longevity or the like depends on fate, but causing the death of other people does not depend on fate." ("Fate" here was explained by kab- balists as meaning that the woman was destined to marry someone particular, and any other man she married would die. See Derisha to Tur, Even ha-'Ezer 9:1. This can be seen as a variant of one of the motifs in the Book of Tobit; see above at n. 21. Cf. below n. 66.) Note the story in B. Ketubbot 62b, cited above, of the death of Rabbi's intended daughter-in-law. On the other hand, it is clear that R. Ashi himself believed in the power of astrology; see, e.g., B. Shabbat 156a. Cf. B. Bava Batra 12a-b, where both Rava and R. Ashi speak of sages born under the same astrological sign. 31. R. Abraham b. Ishbili (Responsa, 3, no. 364), reads ~in instead of xn and takes this to be the third-century amora Rabba.

Nashim [Heb.] (Tel-Aviv, 1968), p. 71, n. 2. (Rava's pre- ceding statement discussed there may originally have been only "One should not marry a woman from a family with epileptics or lepers.") The Rabba/Rava interchange is discussed by S. Friedman in a forthcoming study. 32. But according to the anonymous gemara in B. Nidda 64a, both Rav and Samuel follow R. Simeon b. Gamaliel.</page><page sequence="17">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 39 c. B. Ketubbot 65a After Abbaye's death, Homa appeared before Rava's court to establish how much support she was entitled to as a widow. She was obviously a very beautiful woman, and when she raised her arm to show the size of the gob- lets of wine she used to drink when Abbaye was alive, her sleeve fell back, and her arm was exposed. Rava immediately went home and asked his wife to have intimate relations with him. His coming home this way in the middle of the day made her suspicious, and she demanded to know who had been in court. When she heard that it was Homa, she ran out, striking Homa with the lock of a chest,33 and chased her all the way out of the town of Mehloza, exclaiming, "You already killed three; now you want to kill another." This affair implies that Rava's wife feared he might actually marry .Homa.34 (Rava's tolerance of polygyny is mentioned repeatedly.)35 If so, it would seem that at least she believed that marriage to a "killer wife" was not strictly prohibited but merely to be avoided as sound advice. Actually, if we judge from Rava's remarks after Abbaye married Homa, his wife had noth- ing to worry about. In any event, we should not base too much on the words of a jealous wife. d. Various Mishnahs and the Anonymous Bavli Certain mishnahs deal with the remarriage of a woman widowed a num- ber of times. None of them refers to the "killer wife" superstition or to any restrictions. But in some cases the anonymous sugya in the Babylonian Tal- mud draws pertinent inferences. Yevamot 2:10 implies that a twice-widowed woman is permitted to remarry. The Talmud (B. Yevamot 26a) notes that this counters Rabbi's ruling, and it interprets the mishnah as referring to the case of a woman once 33. Rashi.

This interpretation is not warranted by the text of the mishnah. M. Yevamot 3:7 (end) deals with a levirate case where a twice-widowed woman is permitted to marry the third brother, and the Tal- mud makes no comment on this.36 M. Yevamot 16:2 (T. Yev. 14:3, p. 51) con- cerns a twice-widowed woman, the second time from a levirate marriage. The anonymous tanna rules that she may not remarry, but only because of the insufficient evidence of the death of her first husband; R. Eliezer rules that she may marry a third time. The Talmud does not comment here on the "killer wife" issue. The same is the case with M. Yevamot 9:5-6, which relates to a thrice-widowed woman. T. Yevamot 11:5 concerns a woman who reported (or received a report) that her husband had died abroad and then-without an explicit court ruling-remarried. This situation repeated itself until she married her fourth husband. This is the text of Codex Vienna. The other versions omit one case, but the omission is likely to have been unintentional.37 Most of the sources discussed in the preceding paragraph deal with third marriages, and it could be argued that they correspond to R. Simeon b. Gamaliel's ruling. This cannot be done in the last case, since it deals with a fourth marriage. But the marriage took place on the wife's own initiative and without court permission. Consequently, we can assume that there was no absolute general aversion to such marriages (if in fact the fourth husband knew of all the previous ones), but not that the sages sanctioned them.38 36. Also cf. M. Yevamot 3:9 (R. Simeon); B. Yevamot 28b-R. Safra's hypothetical case concerning six brothers. Cf. below n. 79. 37. The beraita deals with a case where "all" of the first husbands returned from abroad. "All" clearly suggests that there were at least three before her last marriage. There are addition- al indications of omissions in the other versions. The Erfurt Codex has here only "three hus- bands," but the third and last husband also goes abroad. As Lieberman notes (Tosefta Ki- Fshulah, 6:110, n. 19), there is no point to this. (Lieberman inadvertently refers to the fourth husband rather than the third, and says that the four words describing his trip abroad are superfluous.) These words are a remnant of an additional clause dealing with another husband. Similarly, the Geniza manuscript cited in the apparatus has only "two husbands" (even though it too speaks of "all" of them). The words "they came and told her" are clearly a remnant of an additional clause, and they were deleted by a later hand. 38. Cf. T. Yevamot 8:6 (p. 26): "How many times may she [a barren woman] marry? Three. More than that she may marry only one who has a wife and children. If she marries someone who does not have a wife and children, she is divorced without the ketubba, because her mar- riage is a mistaken marriage." See Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshulah, 6:72-74. Cf. T. Nedarim 6:4 (p. 117): "A betrothed girl ... her husband did not hear her [vow] before he died, and she became betrothed again, even to ten [one after the other]." B. Qiddushin 77b mentions the hypothetical case of a thrice-widowed woman.</page><page sequence="19">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 41 Other than the passage in T. Shabbat 15:8, the Mishnah and Tosefta seem to ignore the "killer wife" even in cases where some reference would be natural. Should we infer from their silence that the editors of these works- or the sages whose rulings are cited in the relevant passages (Rabbi was the editor of the Mishnah!)-considered marriage to a "killer wife" something that a prudent man would avoid after having been warned but not as being strictly prohibited? I do not believe that one can go beyond hypothesis here. The Talmud ignores some of these passages and does not take up our ques- tion. On the other hand, the anonymous gemara does make an interesting comment on a mishnah that really has nothing to do with the issue. M. Ketubbot 4:2 concerns the rights of a girl's father to her ketubba money if she was divorced from her first marriage and widowed from the second. Her subsequent marriage is not discussed. The gemara notes that, following Rabbi, the mishnah intentionally avoided a case where the girl had been widowed twice, since she "would no longer be fit to remarry." "Not fit" (Krn) suggests a definite prohibition, and this is made explicit in some ver- sions of the text (XK'4).39 e. The Yerushalmi I have not seen any references to passages in the Palestinian Talmud that deal with the "killer wife" superstition, and to the best of my knowledge there is none. The Yerushalmi is silent on the issue even in those places, dis- cussed above, where its mention would be expected. It is tempting to suggest that the Palestinian amoraim did not believe in the superstition. In general, the Palestinian Talmud has been described as having less demonology (and angelology), sorcery, magic, astrology, and other kinds of superstitions than the Babylonian. But we should be cautious about drawing conclusions from arguments from silence, especially for specific issues.40 39. See The Babylonian Talmud with Variant Readings ... Kethuboth, vol. 1, p. 320, n. 32. 40. Note especially P. Yevamot 6:6, 7d (above, n. 25), where other cases where a sequence is presumed after two or three occurrences are cited. Yefe Enayim (to B. Yevamot 64b) suggests that the Yerushalmi would prohibit remarriage after the death of two husbands. It does so on the basis of the remark in this Yerushalmi passage that the tanna who ruled that three occur- rences define a precedent would agree that after two babies had died from circumcision a third should not be circumcised, because of the danger. But in light of the Yerushalmi's silence on the "killer wife," I do not believe that this conclusion is warranted. For the relative absence of magic and similar phenomena in the Palestinian Talmud, see, e.g., L. Ginzberg, A Commentary</page><page sequence="20">42 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN f. Bereshit Rabba 85:5 (p. 1039) R. Eleazar4' said, "Even though there is no [permissible] divination [nablash, see Num. 23:23] there is an omen [simman]-'For he thought, he too might die like his brothers' (Gen. 38:11)." Two other versions of this tradition appear in talmudic literature; neither refers specifically to the "killer wife." P. Shabbat 6:9, 8c It has been taught [tene]. R. Eliezer b. Jacob says, "You shall not practice divi- nation or soothsaying" (Lev. 19:26). Even though there is no divination, there is an omen-provided that it is after three signs.42 So "when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died" (Gen. 48:7); "Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you would take away Benjamin" (ibid. 42:36). B. lfullin 95b It has been taught [tanya]. R. Simeon b. Eleazar says, "A house, an infant/ child [tinoq], and a woman-even though there is no divination, there is an omen-provided that it has occurred three times,43 for it says, 'Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and you would take away Benjamin."' Despite the differences between these three versions in the attribution of the saying and in its text, they can be assumed to be variants of one basic tradition: "Even though there is no divination there is an omen." Bereshit Rabba, which alone cites the Tamar story, corresponds with Rabbi's ruling that two occurrences are considered a precedent. The Yerushalmi and Bavli versions correspond with that of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, which requires three occurrences to establish a sequence.

The fIullin passage requires some comment. The omission of the refer- ence to Gen. 48:7 (Rachel's death) has caused difficulties for the commenta- tors (cf. Rashi), as this leaves only two previous occurrences. Moreover, it is not clear what "a house, an infant/child, and a woman" refer to. Rashi explains: "If he succeeded in business after building a house, after a baby was born, or after he married, it is a sign that he will continue to succeed." R. Gershom: "It is a sign if he has good luck or bad luck three times after dedicating a house, after the birth of a baby, or after marrying a wife." Maimonides (Avoda Zara 11:5) refers to one who says that he has had good luck with a house he built, a wife he married, or an animal he purchased; and if one asked a child what verse he was learning and it was a lucky verse, one should see it as a good sign. ("These and the like are permissible, since he neither planned his actions or inactions based on them but only con- sidered what already had happened an omen for himself.") The school- child's verse is discussed as an omen in the lines before our passage in B. Hullin 95b,44 and this explains Maimonides' comment here. The sages remark that gentiles would consult astrologers (who would say "the divina- tion is good(?)" n vrnm) before an undertaking, such as the purchase of a slave or a marriage (or the birth of a baby).45 The Bavli passage may refer to such practices when it forbids divination. (It is interesting to note that medieval Jewish marriage contracts of various traditions, for example those written in Fustat and preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have the words "in a good augury" [K Kvrn:] written over the text. I hardly think those Jews practiced divination, but they were not careful with their choice of words. This has not been found in any of the Palestinian-style marriage contracts; instead, they have "in the name of our Creator"46 or "in a good sign" 44. See S. Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, 2nd ed. (New York, 1962), pp. 194-199. 45. Before a general undertaking: P. Shabbat 6:10, 8d (or rather before purchasing mer- chandise; see S.

In light of the Bereshit Rabba parallel and the other sources discussed above, serious consideration should be given to the explanation of the IHullin passage found in Sefer Ifasidim. They said, "An infant, a house, and a woman are omens." A woman: She does not marry a third or fourth if her husbands died one after the other, after they had intimate relations with her, and they died without children or immediately after intercourse, like Er and Onan, who did not tarry with Tamar. An infant: If they circumcised the first, second, and third, and they died. ... Similarly a house: If one built a new house or entered a new house in which three people had died one after the other; he deserves to die [endangers his life] if he tarries in this house.48 The Bereshit Rabba passage is the closest the talmudic sages came to admitting the pagan origin of the "killer wife" superstition. Divination is forbidden by the Torah (Lev. 19:26). But paganism no longer was consi- dered a threat to rabbinic Judaism, and certain practices and beliefs- whether introduced from foreign sources or emerging from the depths of the popular religious consciousness-were condoned by the sages, despite their implicit pagan overtones. In doing so, the sages sometimes reinterpreted superstitions to make them compatible with their understanding of the requirements of Jewish tradition.49 In our case, this clearly seems to have tion: Jewry under Islam," in The Jewish Family: Metaphor and Memory, ed.

The "killer wife" superstition was defined as belonging to the latter cate- gory. Its dissociation from divination or any pagan beliefs rendered it accep- table to the rabbis. Furthermore, there is no suggestion in our sources that the sages-many of whom believed in demons-thought that a demon possessed or "protected" a woman whose many husbands died. As we have seen, their deaths were explained by Rava as caused by sexual contact (today one would imagine that she was a carrier of AIDS) and by R. Ashi as the result of fate. Perhaps these explanations too served to make the belief compatible. Whether pseudo-medical or astrological, the superstition could be considered as based on sound contemporary scientific theories or at least within the boundaries of what the sages considered religiously acceptable. As Lieberman wrote, "A learned and cultured man of those times could not reject the science of Astrology, a science recognized by all of the civilized ancient world."50 g. Midrash Tanbuma A late reworking of the Tobias and Sarah story appears in Midrash Tan- buma, Ha'azinu, par. 8. The bride's first three husbands die on their wedding night. Her cousin and fourth husband-there is no suggestion that this marriage is forbidden-is saved from this fate when she confronts the Lord's messenger, who has come to claim her groom, and demands, on the authority of the Torah (Deut. 24:5), that he be released: "When a man has taken a bride, he shall not go out with the army or be assigned to it for any purpose; he shall be exempt one year for the sake of his household, to give happiness to the woman he has married." When God hears this, He calls off His angel; and the danger is averted. In its reworked version the pagan elements have been removed from the tale, and it has been altered in keeping with Jewish concepts. The demon has been replaced by an (unnamed) angel of God. His mission is canceled 50. Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine, p. 68. Many Jews accepted astrology (and other pagan practices and beliefs) without question. Some sages rejected it outright (see Lieberman, pp. 99 ff.). On astrology and demonology among the rabbis, see Neusner, History of the Jews in Babylonia, 4:330 ff.</page><page sequence="24">46 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN because of an argument based on a verse from the Torah, not as a result of any magical exorcism rites.5' h. Ruth in the Midrashic (and Kabbalistic) Literature The Book of Ruth associates the Judah and Tamar story with Ruth's marriage to Boaz both in the good wishes extended to the latter in 4:12 ("And may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah-through the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman") and in the genealogy at the end of the book (4:18-22), which iden- tifies Boaz as a descendant of Perez, six generations removed (and Obed, Boaz and Ruth's son, as David's grandfather). A number of parallels can be drawn between the two women. Both are resolute widows (and "foreign- ers") who take bold action (with older men related to their husbands) to assure that offspring will be provided for the dead.52 It is rather ironical that some midrashim and later commentators draw a further parallel by imply- ing or forthrightly stating that, like Tamar, Ruth too may have been con- sidered a "killer wife." The kabbalist Solomon Alkabez (d. 1584), in his commentary to Ruth, Shoresh Yishai, quotes Judah Ibn Shoshan: "The midrash expounds that she [Ruth] entered a levirate marriage with Chilion" (after her first husband, his brother Mahlon, had died). After Chilion's death Ruth would thus be considered (according to Rabbi) a "killer wife," and this explains, he sug- gests, the reluctance of Boaz's kinsman to (redeem the estate and) marry her. 51. According to Ginzberg (Legends of the Jews, 6:335, n. 96), "it is difficult to determine with certainty the relation of this legend to the story of Tobit, as it would be a rash conclusion to consider the former directly dependent upon the latter." But the many points of similarity between the two (omitted in the brief summary above) are strong arguments in favor of the opinion of Grintz ("Hebrew Literature in the Persian Period," p. 123) and Schwarzbaum ("The Hero Predestined to Die," pp. 238-240; see literature in n. 46 there) that "this story is nothing else than a folk-retelling of the old, famous tale embedded in the Book of Tobit." (I note here one parallel which might be overlooked: as in Tobit, the bride addresses her groom as "my brother." Cf. M. A. Friedman, "Israel's Response in Hosea 2:17b: 'You Are My Husband,'" Journal of Biblical Literature 99 [1980]: 203.) Schwarzbaum suggests that the number of dead husbands was altered from seven to three to be "more in keeping with the Talmudic statement" (discussed above). But as a fourth marriage is forbidden even according to R. Simeon b. Gamaliel's ruling, I hardly think that this was intended. Schwarzbaum does not discuss the other changes which are noted above. 52. Cf., e.g., Kaufmann, Religion of Israel [Heb.], vol. 2, book 1, p. 212; Gordis, "Love, Marriage and Business," pp. 241 ff.</page><page sequence="25">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 47 "Subsequently, I believe that she was a killer wife, and 'So-and-so' let her go 'lest he impair his estate.' But Boaz was not afraid of this."" Alkabez remarks that he searched high and low for such a midrash but could not find one. He suggests that Ibn Shoshan may have inferred as much from Ruth Rabba 7.7, 10, which comments on the redeemer's disclaimer (Ruth 4:6: "Then I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own estate. You take over my right of redemption, for I am unable to exercise it"): He said, "The first ones died only because they married her. Should I marry her? God forbid. I will not mix my descendants [seed]. I will not mix worthless matter [offspring] with my children." And he did not know that a new interpretation of the law had already been established: "An Ammonite" [male] (Deut. 23:4)-not an Ammonite female; "a Moabite" [male]-not a Moabite female.54 The text is not without difficulties. "I will not mix worthless matter [offspring] with my children" appears to be a gloss to the preceding clause. From the closing remarks, it is clear that the redeemer supposedly believed that it was (still) forbidden to marry a Moabite woman. (The midrash attri- butes the exegesis which permitted this marriage to Boaz's court.)" Conse- quently, he did not want the offspring of a forbidden union among his chil- dren. As to the preceding statement, "the first ones died only because they married her," three questions present themselves. Who were the "first ones"? Why did marrying Ruth cause their deaths? And if the redeemer feared that he too would die if he married her, why is he concerned with the offspring of the marriage? To begin with the last question, two separate excuses may have been combined here: the redeemer's fear of death and, should he live and produce offspring from the marriage, his fear that this offspring would be unworthy and would pollute his family. (The redeemer's 53. Shoresh Yishai to Ruth 4:9 (reprint ed., Bat Yam, 1981, p. 71a). 54. Ruth Rabba 7:7, 10, ed. M. B. Lerner ("The Book of Ruth in Aggadic Literature and Midrash Ruth Rabba" [Heb.] [Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1971], 2:186, 190). For the term pesolet "worthless matter (offspring)" (so translated by Jastrow, Dictionary, 2:1191), see Ler- ner, 3:75. For the present context, cf. Ruth Rabba 4:9 (ed. Lerner, 2:112): "Doeg the Edomite ... said, 'Even if he is from Perez, isn't he from a disqualified family [pesul mishpaba]? Isn't he from Ruth the Moabite?'"; 8:1 (p. 204): "David said. .. 'How long will they say: Isn't he from a disqualified family?'" 55. See Lerner, 1:106-109.</page><page sequence="26">48 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN fear of death and his concern for the offspring of the union are not necessari- ly mutually exclusive; see below concerning Boaz.) The "first ones" might be a loose expression for Ruth's first husband.56 But, as Alkabez suggested, it could be understood as implying that she had had two husbands; and the London manuscript of the midrash in fact adds here: "Mahlon and Chil- ion.""57 If Ruth's first two husbands had died, she could be assumed (by Rabbi) to be a "killer wife." The redeemer may have attributed their deaths not only to their transgression in having married a Moabite woman58 but also, or alternatively, to the widow superstition. It is noteworthy that the midrash also suggests that the redeemer might have considered marrying Ruth but abstaining from intimate relations with her. Boaz (tragically-see below) dissuaded him from this course.59 (Moshe Sofer in his Responsa [/Jatam Sofer] writes that he found in H. J. D. Azulai's commentary to Ruth, Simhat ha-Regel, "in the name of the midrash," that Chilion, Ruth's first husband, died, and Mahlon married her.60 Sofer apparently wrote this from memory. Azulai remarks that Mah- lon was Ruth's first husband and Chilion the levir. And he did not quote it in the name of the midrash but rather cited Simon Habillo's seventeenth- century kabbalistic commentary on Ruth, Heleq Bene Yehuda.6' Habillo wrote that after Mahlon's death, Chilion took Ruth in a levirate marriage; but he quotes no sources.62 Azulai himself reconstructs an interesting debate 56. Cf., e.g., B. 'Eruvin 53a: "The 'first ones' is R. Akiva." 57. Lerner, 2:187, variant readings to line 88; cf. Lerner, 3:75, who cites Alkabez. 58. This agrees with R. Meir's midrash on Ruth 1:4 ("They married Moabite women") in Ruth Rabba 2:9: "They did not proselytize them and immerse them, and they did not let the new interpretation of the law be established. Had they let the new interpretation of the law be estab- lished, they would not have been punished because of them. An Ammonite (male)--not an Ammonite female; a Moabite (male)-not a Moabite female." This is the correct text of the midrash; see S. Lieberman, "Some Notes to the Beginning of Ruth Rabba" [Heb.], in Henoch Yalon Jubilee Volume (Jerusalem, 1963), p. 179. A passage in B. Ketubbot 11la seems to reflect a liberal application of this theme: A man's brother in Be Hozaa (Babylonia) died and his sister- in-law thus became eligible for levirate marriage. He came before R. Hanina (in Eretz Israel) and asked him, "Is one permitted to emigrate ['descend'] in order to perform the levirate?" He responded, "His brother married a gentile. Bless the Lord for killing him. He wants to go down after him?!" 59. Ruth Rabba 7:9 (ed. Lerner, 2:188). Cf. Friedman, Jewish Polygyny in the Middle Ages, pp. 9-10. 60.

The former supposedly believed that the law restricting the remarriage of a "killer wife" applied to the levirate [or "redemption"], while Boaz thought that it did not. This is an old question; see below our discussion on Maimonides' responsum.) The midrash describes Tamar's bearing a child to Judah as a result of divine intervention.63 The same is done for Ruth and Boaz. Both are described as being beyond their productive years. Boaz is eighty, Ruth forty. Moreover, like the matriarchs in the midrash, Ruth was born without a full set of reproductive organs, and her ability to conceive is the result of a miraculous "operation."64 Identifying Ruth as a widow from her first two husbands completes the comparison with Tamar. Both are feared as "killer wives" who entered levirate/redemption marriages to become progenitors of David and symbols of life and motherhood. (According to the kabbalists, Mahlon and Chilion were reincarnations of Er and Onan.) But the strangest twist to the Ruth saga is added by that midrash which has Boaz die imme- diately after he consummates his marriage with Ruth. According to Midrash Ruth Zutta, "They said, 'On the same night that he had intercourse with her he died."'" (In the Leqab Tov version, he died while having intercourse.)65 The midrash does not comment on Ruth as a possible cause of his death. As Boaz was an octogenarian, his being kept alive just until he impreg- nated Ruth could be construed as one of the semimiraculous aspects of the events supplied by the midrash. But overtones of the "killer wife" motif are so salient in these midrashim that it is difficult to consider them as being unintentional. One can hardly imagine that the rabbis had any specific pur- pose in inventing these midrashim other than to embellish the story and complete the connection with Tamar. 63. See above, n. 13. 64.

Maimonides In the post-talmudic period we find a new Hebrew term for a woman whose husbands die: qallanit, literally "killer woman." There is an abun- dance of medieval and postmedieval sources relevant to the attitudes and legal rulings on the widow syndrome, but these are beyond the scope of this paper.66 Maimonides' writing on the subject is too significant to pass over. He treats it in a detailed responsum that deals with a twice-widowed woman who was now a candidate for a levirate marriage.67 One of the local scholars argued that she could not enter such a marriage, since she was mubzeqet ("assumed") to be a woman whose husbands die. This opinion was support- ed by an old responsum from some authority. Another scholar argued that fulfillment of the levirate was a commandment which superseded the prohi- bition of remarriage for a woman with the "assumed" status. In his responsum Maimonides expressed his amazement that scholars would fail to distinguish between different categories of prohibitions: things forbidden by the Torah, things forbidden by the sages, and things which are "reprehensible" (makrah) but not forbidden. The remarriage of the woman "assumed" to lose her husbands belongs to the latter category. It is "doubt- ful danger to life, fear of which is in way of soothsaying, divination, conjec- tures,68 and fantasies,69 from which at some time bodies of weak constitution 66. See, e.g., Bet Yosef to Tur, Even ha-'Ezer 9. A search on the computer of Bar-Ilan University's responsa program with qatlanit as the key word produced quotations from 114 responsa. One of these did not refer to the widow syndrome but to the case of a kohen involved in a fatal car accident (n,~t~p mlxn). Note that according to the Zohar (Jerusalem: Mossad ha- Rav Kook, 1960, II, 203), Mishpatim, the ghost of the first husband remains with the widow and causes the death of other husbands. On "philosophical" considerations in Albo's respon- sum (above, n. 28), see I. Ta-Shma, Sefunot 3 (1985) 110. 67. R. Moses b. Maimon, Responsa, ed. J. Blau, vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 1960), no. 218, pp. 384-388 (cf. Blau's notes and references to scholarly literature). The responsum (without the question) has recently been reedited by I. Shailat, Letters and Essays of Moses Maimonides [Heb.], vol. 2 (Maaleh Adumim, 5748), 620-623. The widow syndrome is treated in responsum no. 15 (Blau, 1:22-24) as well. The latter is translated and discussed in my paper "The Ransom- Divorce: Divorce Proceedings Initiated by the Wife in Mediaeval Jewish Practice," Israel Oriental Studies 6 (1976): 293-296; n. 37 there deals with the text of no. 218. 68.

Arabic takhayyuldt can also be translated "imagination, delusions, hallucinations, fancies, whims, fantastic notions."</page><page sequence="29">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 51 might be affected." There can be no comparison between the real danger caused by circumcising a baby whose brothers had died from this operation and the remarriage of the widow. The latter involves no prohibition what- soever, and marrying such a woman is no more wrong than "eating from a bunch of vegetables tied by a gardener" (which makes one susceptible to witchcraft according to a gentile witch quoted in B. Shabbat 82a). In all of Andalusia, states Maimonides, a woman widowed many times was never denied remarriage, especially if she was a young woman. It is pre- ferable for pious men to avoid officiating at such a woman's betrothal, but they should explicitly inform her that if she finds someone to marry her, they will not require the couple to get a divorce.7" By legal subterfuge (bila) the couple arranges to perform the betrothal privately, in the presence of two witnesses. They than appear in court, and the rabbis forthright issue them a marriage contract and perform the wedding ceremony. Maimonides testifies that this practice was followed by the courts of R. Isaac Alfasi and R. Joseph Ibn Migash, by their successors, and by himself since he settled in Egypt.7 All of this, including the legal subterfuge, concerns a regular widow, not a levirate widow. No restrictions whatsoever apply to the mar- riage of the latter, which is a commandment of the Torah. Maimonides, the rationalist and physician, ignored the Talmud's pseu- do-medical and astrological explanations of the "killer wife" superstition and, in his responsum, struck at its very heart by identifying it as nothing less than "soothsaying, divination, conjecture, and fantasy." His words are in direct conflict with the sages' justification of the superstition--"even though there is no [permissible] divination, there is an omen," explicitly applied by the midrash to Judah's fear of Tamar. (But not, as we have seen, by the parallel in B. lHullin 95b, which Maimonides interpreted otherwise and could have considered as taking precedence over the midrash passage.) 70. The word "divorce" has been corrupted in the Arabic original but is preserved in the medieval Hebrew translations. See Blau, 2:387, nn. 33, 11. S. Abramson, in his notes to this responsum in Blau, vol. 3 (1961), p. 167, suggests another way to read the text, according to which the court does not advise the widow to circumvent the talmudic prohibition; but in his notes to Blau, vol. 4 (1986), p. 54, he states that Maimonides did in fact recommend advising the widow to get betrothed. I concur with Shailat, 2:622, n. 15, in upholding Blau's suggestion on the text. Also cf. Otzar ha-Geonim, ed. B. M. Lewin (Yevamot), 7:145, no. 339. 71. On Alfasi and the widow syndrome, see Nalhmanides, Novellae to Yevamot [Heb.], ed. S. Dickman (Jerusalem, 5747), pp. 236-237 and n. 295. As to Ibn Migash, see A. Frieman's note in Blau, 2:387, n. 12 (cf. Abramson, ibid., 3:167, 4:54).</page><page sequence="30">52 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN The full import of the master's identifying this belief with al-fa'l wal-zajr ("soothsaying and divination") is made evident by a comparison with his Sefer ha-Miswot, Negative Commandment 33: The prohibition by which we were forbidden to practice soothsaying and divi- nation [al-fa'l wal-zajr], as when the common people say, "Now that I have returned from the journey, my need will not be taken care of" or "The first thing that I saw today was such and such, so I will gain something today." This type is most prevalent among the masses of the ignorant religions. Whoever takes action depending on soothsaying and divination is to be beat- en by lashes, as stated by the Most High, "Let no one be found among you who consigns . . . or who is a soothsayer, a diviner" [Deut. 18:10].72 The sometime possible effect on bodies of weak constitution, itself a medical explanation, seems to have been understood by Maimonides as the result of the "soothsaying, divination, conjectures, and fantasies" them- selves (this follows from the Arabic original).73 In his son R. Abraham's commentary to Gen. 38:11, fear of the physical effects of marrying too young is attributed to Judah. "Then Judah said to [his daughter-in-law] Tamar," etc. ["'Stay as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up'-for he thought, 'He too might die like his brothers."'] My father's father's [comment], may his memory be for a blessing: "When he said to her 'until my son Shelah grows up' this was to get rid of her, for he had decided that he would not give him to her in marriage at all." And it is more likely that he postponed [Shelah's] marriage until he grew up because he imagined [tawahhama] that the cause of Er's and Onan's deaths was their having married when they were young, due to illnesses and weakness which as a result befell them. He did not know their secrets [secret sins], which the Most High revealed by way of his messenger's words.74 Maimonides deals with the twice-widowed woman in his Mishne Torah 72.

A twice-widowed woman does not marry [Ktvm 5] a third time. If she does marry, she need not be divorced. And even if she were only betrothed, the marriage may be completed. Some have suggested that "does not marry" is intended as an outright prohibition and that Maimonides thereby opposed the ruling in his respon- sum according to which the court would explicitly advise the woman to cir- cumvent the restriction by having a betrothal performed in private.75 But there is no proof that this is the case, as the phrase in question is not Maimo- nides' but a quotation from the talmudic passage (where, admittedly, we suggested that it did refer to a prohibition). The very next ruling in his code instructs that "one does not marry" (xvt x, also a quotation) into the family of a boor. This is one of the marriages defined by Maimonides in his Commentary to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 7:4) as makrah ("reprehensible"), the same term, borrowed from Islamic legal nomenclature, which he uses in his responsum for the marriage of the twice-widowed woman.76 There is no reason to conclude that he intended a full prohibition for either. The other unions listed in his Mishnah Commentary as makrah, e.g., taking many wives,77 were clearly not intended as outright prohibitions.

Schacht, An Introduction to Islamic Law [Oxford, 1964], pp. 121-122), Maimonides uses this category for actions which are reprehensible but not prohibit- ed. So in his Mishnah Commentary, ed. J. Kafib, to Bava Mezia 5:11 (p. 74; see n. 28 there), Sanhedrin 7:4 (pp. 181, 182, 184), and Avot 1:16 (p. 417). See J. L.

He did so in disregard of the Talmud.78 While relying on the precedent of earlier Maghrebi scholars, he boldly-and, I believe, somewhat sarcastically-permitted himself such exegetical license as to equate the explicit talmudic prohibition of remarriage of a woman widowed two or three times, promulgated by the tannaim and confirmed by the Babylonian amoraim (and anonymous gemara), with a witch's tale about eating vegetables from a bunch. He conceded that such a marriage should be designated "reprehensible." But in consideration of his explicitly designating the superstition as soothsaying and divination, this must be understood as only a matter of form or harmonization, as was the legal subterfuge of recommending a private betrothal and the Mishne Torah state- ment that this woman "does not marry." For all intents and purposes Maimonides "exorcised the demon" and abolished the talmudic prohibition of marrying a "killer wife." With this we come full circle to the biblical narration's rejection of Judah's superstition. Although the Talmud does not explicitly apply the prohibition to levirate cases,79 we have seen in the Bereshit Rabba passage that the sages were well aware of the connection of this syndrome with the levirate story of Tamar.80 Maimonides disregarded this source and ruled that levirate marriage is not affected by the qatlanit superstition. Irony at its best. 6. Summary Our paper discusses the "killer wife" superstition over an extended period and deals with details found in different kinds of sources. A summary of the main points is in order. The Garden of Eden story teaches that death is not the fault of woman. Man is responsible for his own actions, and death is the result of sin. Woman is the source of life. This may have involved the reworking of an old folktale in which "Eve" (mrn) was understood as "snake," whereas the Torah explains that "she was the mother of all living things." This lesson was ignored by a few of the talmudic sages, who associated death with women. The belief that certain women are responsible for their husbands' deaths, 78. Cf. I. Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New Haven, 1980), p. 481. 79. Even where relevant; see above, n. 36. 80. Cf. Midrash ha-fHefeS: "'For he thought, he too might die like his brothers' [Gen. 38:11 ]. From here we learn that if a woman marries one man and he dies, and a second and he dies, she may not marry a third" (Torah Shelemah, 6:1457, no. 55; see comment there).</page><page sequence="33">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 55 presumably because of some malevolent forces connected with them, appears in Gen. 38. Judah believes that his daughter-in-law Tamar is to blame for the deaths of his sons Er and Onan. But the narrator clarifies that their deaths had nothing to do with her. Rather, they were evil in the sight of the Lord, and he took their lives. In what is tantamount to a reworking of a prebiblical tradition, the narrator in effect informs us that Judah's belief is to be rejected. We have interpreted this as a general rejection of the "killer wife" belief. The Torah here reconfirms that man by his own voluntary actions decides his fate. Death results from grave sins, not from diabolic forces attached to women. Tamar ("date palm") is a symbol of life. Second Temple literature exonerates Tamar for the deaths of Er and Onan and blames Judah's marriage to a Canaanite woman. But the "killer wife" superstition reappears in the Book of Tobit. Sarah's seven husbands die in the wedding chamber because the jealous demon Ashmedai is in love with her. He slays anyone who attempts to have intimate relations with her. Tobias exorcises the demon by burning the heart and liver of a fish, a trick he has learned from the angel Raphael. The likely Persian origin of the book plus the explicit demonology (and angelology) suggest that the superstition was a foreign (pagan) element reintroduced to Judaism rather than the remnant of a popular belief never eradicated during the biblical period. The story may reflect the Jewish reworking of an earlier pagan tale, in which endogamy, prayer, and procreation were added as reasons for Tobias' deliv- erance. Several talmudic and midrashic passages deal with the superstition. Some sages unquestionably believed in it; and they ruled that to guard against danger, a woman who had been widowed two or three times (according to the respective views of Rabbi and R. Simeon b. Gamaliel) was not permitted to remarry. The ruling, which appears in the Tosefta, is clearly worded as a prohibition. But it is not mentioned in the Mishnah (or else- where in the Tosefta), even where relevant; and we wonder whether this silence might not reflect some intentional "editorial policy." A similar ques- tion can be asked with regard to the Talmud Yerushalmi, where too it is ignored. The Babylonian amoraim, on the other hand, confirmed the danger of the "killer wife." Abbaye taught that she was considered dangerous only after having been widowed three times. He married Homa ("protectress"), a twice-widowed woman, and later died. In condoning the superstition the sages introduced a subtle reinterpreta- tion of its nature whereby they disavowed its manifestly pagan elements. R. Eleazar distinguished between divination, which the Torah prohibits, and an</page><page sequence="34">56 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN omen, thus allowing the precautionary step of not permitting the remarriage of a woman the death of whose first husbands had provided multiple omens. Rava offered what looks like a pseudo-medical explanation for the deaths: sexual contact. R. Ashi attributed them to astrology (mazzal, the planets). Such explanations could have been considered compatible with the religion of the sages. A manifest case of removing pagan elements is attested in the late midrash which is a retelling of the Tobit story. A woman's first three husbands die on their wedding nights because their lives are taken by God's messenger. The woman saves the life of her fourth husband by arguing with the messenger that taking his life would be tantamount to an abrogation of Deut. 24:5. Ironically, some midrashim supply all the elements for identify- ing Ruth as a "killer wife." The subtle shift in approach by the talmudic sages failed to impress Mai- monides. He blasted the "killer wife" superstition as "soothsaying, divina- tion, conjecture, and fantasy." Adoption of the Islamic legal category may have facilitated his downgrading the prohibition to makrfih ("reprehensi- ble"). Marrying such a woman is (sarcastically?) compared to ignoring a witch's advice, quoted in the Talmud, not to eat vegetables tied by a garden- er. The master here seems to have reclassified law as folklore. A woman who had been widowed a number of times should arrange a betrothal in private. Once she had done so, the "reprehensible" aspect of the act would be over; and the rabbis would then conclude the marriage ceremony. Maimonides' liberal reinterpretation of the talmudic sources brings us back to square one: the biblical narrator's rejection of the belief in Gen. 38. The "killer wife" superstition is essentially pagan. Man has free will. His deeds, whether good or evil, decide his fate. The demon in women has been exorcised. Our interpretation of the history of this superstition illustrates the vicis- situdes of a belief related to women, death, and sin through many strata of biblical and later Jewish sources. Successive generations repeatedly inter- preted and reinterpreted the sacred literature and traditions and adjusted them according to their understanding of Israel's heritage. (These processes manifest themselves in the appendix as well. R. Saad- iah Gaon interprets Judah's and Tamar's liaison as mut'a, a temporary marriage; and the two are exonerated from having engaged in fornication. Mut'a was permitted in Islam [in the Shi'a]. Saadiah's comment that it was forbidden by Deut. 24:13 may be seen as a type of polemic, intended to pro- tect the Jewish community's sexual morals from the influence of the domin- ant society.)</page><page sequence="35">THE "KILLER WIFE" SUPERSTITION IN JEWISH TRADITION 57 Appendix Rav Saadiah Gaon and the Kaiaites on Tamar, Judah, and Mut'a Marriage The biblical narration is quite explicit in describing who Judah thought Tamar was when he slept with her. Gen. 38:15: "When Judah saw her, he took her as a harlot [zond]." And in verses 21-22, she is called a "cult prosti- tute" (qedisha) three times. In his Arabic translation of the Torah, Rav Saadiah Gaon usually renders zond as fajira or zaniya. But in Gen. 38 he translates both z6nd and qedishd by the Arabic mumatta'a, "a woman who enters mut'a marriage."' Forbidden sexual relations between humans are divided by Saadiah, in his Arabic commentary to Exod. 20:13, into seven categories of ascending severity. A quotation from this passage was cited several years ago from an unedited Geniza manuscript by the lamented Moshe Zucker. The first (category) is the mut'a marriage, because a woman who does this is called a qedisha, as you learn from the story of Tamar. This is prohibited by (the Torah) stating: "No Israelite woman shall be a qedisha, nor shall any Israelite man be a qddish" [Deut. 23:18]. Both the man and woman are forbid- den thereby. Why is this in the first category of prohibitions? Because it is a marriage with a marriage contract, witnesses, and betrothal. It is placed as a prohibition only because of [its involving] the qualification of a loose woman.2 1. J. Kafib, R. Saadiah Gaon's Comments on the Torah [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1963), p. 43, mistakenly renders mumatta'a in v. 21 as z5nd. 2. M. Zucker, Rav Saadya Gaon's Translation of the Torah [Heb.] (New York, 1959), pp. 477-478. Zucker does not identify the source of the manuscript. Upon my request, Dr. Moshe Sokolow kindly searched Zucker's papers and found reference to Jewish Theological Seminary of America Library EN Adler 2707.51, evidently the manuscript cited by Zucker. (But there is some doubt as to the identification, since there are slight differences in the text of the passage, none of which changes its meaning: ... 5lwa' nm~. .. .K.Xp KlD -n ... n.nos K. ... nrPan rI n nK upj ,-nan!-1 .... ..,w usiw.

My translation of the end of the passage (concerning which I consulted Prof. Joel Kraemer) and the subsequent discussion differ from that offered by Zucker (and by Kafih, op. cit., p. 146, n. 2). The seven categories are as follows: (1) mut'a marriage, (2) rela- tions with an unmarried woman, (3) incest, (4) adultery, (5) relations with a woman with men- strual impurity, (6) relations with a gentile, and (7) (in the manuscript cited in the next note) sodomy (between men). Ibn Ezra, in his Long Commentary to Lev. 18:21 (ed. A. Weisser [Jeru-</page><page sequence="36">58 MORDECHAI A. FRIEDMAN This manuscript breaks off in the sixth category. I have found a manu- script in the Cambridge University Library from a different copy of the commentary that contains the latter portion of Saadiah's discussion. In the text, which continues after a small break between the two manuscripts, the Gaon identifies the seventh category. Following this he adds a comment which also concerns Tamar: There is another category which does not belong to these seven but is sui generis and forbidden. That is coitus interruptus [al-'i'ztl 'an al-nisd']. God requires death for this, as you learn from Onan, concerning whom it says, "whenever he joined with his brother's wife," etc., and then "it was displeasing to the Lord," etc. [Gen. 38:9-10], as I have explained.3 Mut'a marriage, literally "marriage for pleasure," a temporary legal union between a man and woman for the sole purpose of engaging in sex, is sanctioned in Islam (in the Shi'a).4 Saadiah interprets the qddish and qedishd prohibition of Deut. 23:18 as referring to mut'a marriage in his Torah translation and in his Sefer ha-MiSwot as well.5 The identification of mut'a with a qedisha relationship is of interest, among other reasons, because of the suggestion made by modern scholarship that mut'a began among the Arabs as cult prostitution.6 The Karaite Daniel al-Qfimisi similarly designates mut'a as one of two categories of the qdddsh and qedishd prohibition and identifies Judah's affair with Tamar as this kind of relationship and Onan's actions as the other. Daniel claimed that the qedishd is of two categories. One is a man having salem, 1977], 3:57) and in his Short Commentary to Exod. 20:13 (Weisser, 2:138, n. 143), refers to the Gaon's "eight categories." In the former and in his Long Commentary to Exod. 20:13 (where he refers to Saadiah's "several categories") bestiality is added as the most severe cate- gory. No mention of mut'a is made; and the forbidden relations appear in different order. 3. TS Ar. 48.104 (cf. the preceding note).

He considers her to be his wife on this condition, not to be his wife forever with a contract and stipulations. Accord- ing to Daniel the two of them are a qcddsh and a qedisha. They do this in India, where they consider this a marriage. Daniel stated that the death penalty is incurred by both of them. The second category is having intercourse with one's wife for passion only and not for procreation. They are both qddish and qedisha, and they are fornicating, as is written "They shall go whoring but not procreate" [Hos. 4:10, here rendered as understood by al-Qfimisi].7 This is similar to what Onan did, for "he let his seed go to waste" [Gen. 38:9], and "what he did was displeasing to the Lord" [v. 10]. The first category is what Judah did. This category, that is temporary marriage, may have been permis- sible at that time. Sometimes the Muslims do this, and they call it mut'a mar- riage.8 The tenth-century Karaite David b. Abraham al-Fasi makes a comparable statement on temporary marriage, though he avoids use of the term mut'a. A woman who is at the disposal of men is called a qedishd. This is a type of fornication. In antiquity it was permitted-even though considered reprehen- sible [yastasmijanahu]. That is why Judah consented to it .... This name is applied to any woman at the disposal of passersby, and this is called a secret marriage. If done with a contract and witnesses, the verse "she is your partner and covenanted spouse" [Mal. 2:14] applies. It is a temporary marriage, and it is still found among the gentiles. But among Israel it is forbidden, as is written, "There shall not be a qedisha," and concerning one who has intercourse with her, "nor shall there be a qddjsh" [Deut. 23:18].9 Al-Qfimisi and al-Fasi do not describe a mut'a/qedisha relationship as necessarily formalized by any ceremony. Saadiah, contrariwise, describes a completely formal marriage, limited to an agreed period, a possibility also recognized by al-Fasi. 7. Cf. B.

FRIEDMAN As noted by Zucker, there is no indication whatsoever in talmudic sources that a temporary marriage is forbidden. I suggest that Saadiah and the Karaite scholars roughly contemporary with him identified the qdddsh prohibition as mut'a because of their evidently uncompromising condemna- tion of the latter. While only the Shi'a recognized mut'a as such, Sunnis made concessions which rendered temporary marriage acceptable. Al- Shafi'i describes an agreement that the marriage will be temporary made prior to the marriage contract as makrah ("reprehensible").'0 The Jewish savants living under Islam must have regarded mut'a with contempt and considered it no better than legalized prostitution. The influence on Jewish society of the Muslim practice of temporary marriages was evidently sufficient to warrant measures by the Jewish authorities. Nalh- manides' interpretation of the prohibition of remarrying one's divorced wife after her marriage to another (Deut. 24:1-4) as intended to prevent legalized wife swapping-by both couples going through divorces and new temporary marriages-may reflect a similar polemic. (Islam does not permit one to remarry his divorced wife until after she has consummated another mar- riage!)" The sexual license which the Jews who lived under Islam permitted themselves left its mark on Jewish law with reference to other institutions as well, such as concubinage with slave girls.12 Saadiah clarifies both the legally binding nature of mut'a marriage and the reason for its prohibition-its similarity to sex for pleasure only. The former, he emphasizes, explains why it constitutes the first, most lenient, category of sexual prohibitions. (Perhaps he intends a degree of restriction somewhat analogous to makrah "reprehensible" [compare al-Fasi's yastas- mi janahu in reference to the patriarchal period and above on al-Shafi'i], which, as we have seen, is used by Maimonides in connection with the mar- riage of the twice-widowed woman.) The reconstruction of a formal (temporary) marriage which Judah and Tamar supposedly entered, rather than a mere casual liaison, appears in other sources from the gaonic period, both Rabbanite and Karaite.'3 It 10.
