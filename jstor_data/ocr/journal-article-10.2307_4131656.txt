<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Ellenson. After Emancipation: Jewish Religious Responses to Modernity. Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2004. 547 pp. David Ellenson has written numerous important essays in the field of modem Jewish thought, and he has gathered here an impressive collection of some of his more important articles. After working through twenty-three essays ranging from interreligious disputes about organs in synagogues to Marcia Falk' s Book ofBlessings, a reader gains a deeper appreciation for both the signifi- cance of Jewish thought in Germany and Israel and the academic range and intel- lectual candor that Ellenson brings to his studies. Although Ellenson writes for a liberal Jewish audience, these essays, which date back to 1995, bear witness to his sympathetic concern for Orthodoxy and the ways in which the non-Orthodox can expand their religious horizons through a sensitive engagement with other denominations. There is much to be gleaned in these texts for specialists and novices alike-perhaps even more for those who understand religious traditions as firmly embedded within social and cultural forces. Ellenson divides his essays into five general rubrics-"Reflections on Mod- ernity," "The Challenge of Emancipation," "Denominational Responses," "Modem Responsa," and "New Initiatives, New Directions"-but two methodo- logical concerns dominate throughout. As he makes clear in the opening essays to this volume, Ellenson is a student of sociology. The work of Peter Berger on secu- larization and the modern "heretical imperative" to choose among competing options dominate Ellenson's approach to modern Jewish thought. As with any col- lection such as this, the essays often traverse similar themes and arguments, and Berger's name, together with his theory of secularization, finds its way into a number of these chapters. So does the work of Ronald Dworkin and his under- standing of law as an imaginative policy pronouncement rather than a system of rules. Together, Dworkin and Berger provide a methodological frame within which Ellenson approaches two dominant cultural events "after emancipation": 214</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the reconstruction of Jewish tradition in the wake of secular incursions, and the founding of the state of Israel. The first part, "Reflections on Modernity," pays a number of debts to Ellenson's intellectual predecessors and teachers. Here, we first meet Berger and his account of the heretical move from "fate to choice" and Ellenson's mixed views of Jewish life in America. The second and third chapters honor Jacob Katz and Max Weber and their significant work on understanding the soci- ology of religion. The reader emerges from this first section-and ends as well with the last essay on Marcia Falk -with a deep appreciation for Ellenson's sym- pathetic reading of texts. He does not raise Weber's disturbing views of Jews simply to dismiss them, for example. Rather, Ellenson suggests how his anti- Judaism resonates with deep divisions within modem political liberalism and the world of German scholarship. This sensitivity to the cultural patterns within the text is a trademark of Ellenson's thought, and After Emancipation reveals just how fruitful this approach can be for recognizing models of religious practice. This is especially true when Ellenson engages Orthodox responsa to modem dilemmas in the fourth section of the book. There, he shows how his liberal audience can mine Orthodox thought in ways that challenge easy assumptions and conven- tional attitudes. But Ellenson also exposes how contemporary politics and social concerns influence and, in many ways, determine Jewish Orthodox responses to mod- emity. Many of these essays, in this section and elsewhere, follow a similar pattern. Ellenson begins with a general (and often methodological) concern. He then turns to the specific Jewish texts and relates the opening discussion (on Berger, secularization, law, or some such) to the particular Jewish issues raised in the sources. Ellenson then closes his essay with some "concluding reflections," explaining the relevance of these texts and these issues for a liberal Jewish audience. The formula works, in no small part because Ellenson is a masterful reader of the sources even as he maintains a perceptive grasp of contemporary anxieties and concerns. I found his "Modem Responsa" section, together with the essays in the last section on "New Initiatives, New Directions," to be the most rewarding and tren- chant. In particular, the articles on Israeli Rabbi Hayim David Halevi's responsa and David Hartman's account of Jewish hermeneutical practice are all clear, persuasive, and profoundly relevant for contemporary Jewry in America. There are, of course, issues to quibble about. In his account of the Jewish Theological Seminary (in the "Denominational Responses" section), Ellenson should have explored more fully how and when that institution emerged as a distinctly conser- vative one-for those within and outside the movement. And in his discussion of the Frankfurt Reformverein in the 1840s, Ellenson describes their rejection of cir- cumcision for Jewish boys as part of a religious radicalism that also supported moving the Jewish Sabbath to Sunday. But there were also serious medical concerns that motivated these Jewish practitioners, and given Ellenson's treatment of twentieth-century responsa, in which he dwells on the social and cultural cir- cumstances underlying rabbinic legal discussions, one would expect similar cultural sensitivity on this issue as well. But these and other examples really are minor quibbles, and they detract not a bit from the elegance, compassion, intellectual honesty, and critical scrutiny that 215</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Ellenson brings to his academic work. This is an impressive collection, as much for what it reveals about modem Judaism as for the scholarly richness and sophis- tication of its author.
