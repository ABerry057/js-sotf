<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SAMSON NAZIRITE VOW IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY by SAMUEL MORELL I Responsa emanating from the Ottoman lands of the sixteenth century give evidence of the widespread use of an oath which invoked the name of Samson the Nazirite. Someone who undertook a "Samson nazirite vow" generally did so by making it conditional on his performance of or absten- tion from a certain act, thereby using it as an assurance for his word. Although the Samson nazirite, as a halakhic concept, is discussed in the Tal- mud, and its laws are codified by Maimonides, the earliest trace of its use as a contitional sanction does not precede the fifteenth century. It appears then in a single genizah document. The language of the vow is Judeo-Spanish, a fact which points to its provenance. It does not appear in the halakhic litera- ture before the sixteenth century, nor does it appear to have been current even then in Christian Europe.' I would like to acknowledge the help of the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project of the Institute for Computers in Jewish Life in locating some of the sources cited in this study. 1.

The concept of the Samson nazirite vow in the popular mind was far removed, as we shall see, from the formal halakhic categories with which the rabbis were forced to deal. The present study will, on the one hand, allow a glimpse of the popular culture through an examination of the way in which the Samson nazirite vow was commonly conceived and the uses to which it was put. On the other hand, it will analyze the ways in which the rabbis accommodated the halakhah of the Samson nazirite vow to the reality which presented itself to them. II We will begin with some basic definitions. The Talmud distinguishes between shevu'ah, generally translated as "oath," and neder, generally trans- lated as "vow." A shevu'ah is a statement which invokes God as surety for its veracity. A subcategory of shevu'ah consists of a promise that one will do something or not do something. A shevu'ah of this kind, therefore, places a restriction on an individual. A neder, by contrast, places a restriction on an object. It is a declaration that the use or benefit of a particular object is for- bidden to oneself.2 The law of the nazirite in the Torah reads as follows. "When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow [Heb. neder] of a Nazirite ... he shall abstain from wine and strong drink. . . . All the days of his Naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head. .. . All the days that he consecrateth himself unto the Lord he shall not come near a dead body."3 Thus the nazirite's vow is formally designated as a neder, though the law restricts his activity, a characteristic of a shevu'ah. A nazirite undertakes his vow for a specified period of time, minimally thirty days, at 2. See B.T. Nedarim 2b; Moses Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Shavu'ot [Oaths], 1:1-3, and ibid., Nedarim [Vows], 1:1; S. Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine (New York, 1942), p. 117.

Since today there is no possibility of bringing an offering, anyone who undertakes a nazirite vow, even for a limited time, automatically becomes a lifetime nazirite.4 A "Samson nazirite," a category based on the biblical account in Judges 13, differs from a standard nazirite in that he is not prohibited from defiling himself by contact with the dead. On the other hand, he is never permitted to trim his hair, even if it grows heavy, a luxury which is permitted to a standard lifetime nazirite.5 There is another difference between a Samson nazirite and a standard nazirite, which is barely implicit in the Talmud but quite explicit in Mai- monides' Code, and which is of far greater significance for our purposes. It involves the issue of release from vows. The halakhah envisages a mechan- ism for such a release. It can best be presented by Maimonides' concise formulation: If anyone, having uttered a rash oath, regrets it, and on realizing that he will be in distress if he fulfills it, changes his mind about it, or if some new situation occurs to him of which he had not thought at the time of swearing, and causes him to regret his oath, he may consult with a sage, or where no sage is availa- ble with three ordinary men, who may then absolve him from his oath. He is thereupon permitted to do that which he swore not to do, or do that which he swore to do. This is what is meant by absolution from oaths. This proceeding has no basis at all in the Written Law. By tradition, however, it was learned from our teacher Moses...6 It appears from this formulation that the vower's present regret suffices for the granting of a release. Other authorities, however, clearly insist that 4. Code, Naziriteship 2:20. 5. Mishnah Nazir 1:2, B.T. Nazir 4a. 6. Code, Oaths 6:1-2. "Some new situation" is my translation of she-nolad lo davar replacing Klien's "something." The Geonim, from Yehudai Gaon (mid-8th cent.) on, discon- tinued the releasing of oaths except for special cases, those similar to the "four vows which the sages permitted" (see Mishnah Nedarim 3:1-4 and sec. xiii below), and then only when there was a pressing need for the release; see B. M. Lewin, Otsar ha-Geonim, vol. 11 (Jerusalem, 1942), p. 131. However, the practice of releasing vows seems to have been in use everywhere after the classical geonic period. Asher ben Yehiel's attribution of the geonic position to Alfasi, in Pisqei ha-Rosh (printed with B.T.), Nedarim, chap. 2, no. 2, seems to be an error for Hai Gaon; see Lewin, p. 19, note a.</page><page sequence="4">226 SAMUEL MORELL he must regret that he ever made the vow.7 In any case, he is not necessarily claiming that the vow was made under mistaken pretenses. Had that in fact been the case, there are opinions, as we shall see, which would dispense with the need for a formal release altogether. Now, a naziriteship is a form of vow, and is subject to the release mechanism. However, Maimonides tells us that, unlike a standard nazirite, "He who vows to become a Nazirite like Samson may not seek absolution from his vows, for the Naziriteship of Samson was perpetual."8 The significance of this will shortly become appar- ent. III The Samson nazirite vow was ultimately used as a means of ensuring the fulfillment of a commitment. It was a self-inflicted sanction, conditional on the violation of one's promised word. Although its use is not documented before the fifteenth century, its purpose had long been served by a variety of other conditional sanctions used for similar purposes. A perusal of represen- tative responsa collections from thirteenth- through fifteenth-century Ger- many, Spain, and North Africa yields the following examples: a monetary fine (Germany and Spain);9 a ban of excommunication, sometimes spelling out its implications for both "this world and the next" (Spain and North Africa);'0 a prohibition on meat and wine, or on meat alone (Spain and North Africa).' I Especially striking is the assurance that if one recants his vow, it should be taken as proof that he does not believe in God (Spain) or 7. Pisqei ha-Rosh, Nedarim, chap. 3, no. 2. 8.

IV The effectiveness of a vow in providing a sanction to serve as an assur- ance for one's word is severely weakened, of course, by the availability of a mechanism for a release from vows. The same corpus of thirteenth- to fifteenth-century responsa gives evidence of attempts to strengthen the assurance by eliminating the possibility of release. The simplest such attempt is the incorporation of a phrase to the effect that the vow shall not be subject to release."5 From a halakhic perspective, such a declaration, as part of the vow, is itself subject to release. This observation brings into focus the popular, "small tradition" nature of the whole phenomenon. A barely more sophisticated approach, but subject to the same objection, is a separ- 12.

The same can be said for the provision, "If I seek release, I will be considered excom- municated and banned."''7 There is a firmer foundation for irrevocability in making the vow "upon the consent" of others.'" Here there are grounds for ruling that one can only be released from such a vow with the consent of those named. However, if the release is for the purpose of a mitzvah, then the consent need not be obtained;"9 and mitzvah is defined broadly in this regard to include the establishment of communal or domestic peace.20 Thus, a significant percen- tage of cases are excluded. There seems to be little doubt, therefore, that the popularity of the Samson nazirite vow was fueled by its irrevocability. In order to appreciate the overriding concern with irrevocability, and the use of the Samson nazir- ite vow within this context, one may consider the wording of a contract from Salonica in the year 1551, establishing a partnership in a tax-farming ven- ture. Following the substance of the agreement, we read that the parties undertook a stringent vow to abide by the conditions detailed above. There then follows an impressive series of devices designed to ward off the possibil- ity of either party seeking a release from the vow, which culminates in the acceptance of the Samson nazirite vow by each of the principals "if, Heaven forfend, he will transgress any matter of what is written above, from today until three years have passed from the tenth of April next."2' 16.

Be that as it may, its earliest literary trace, save for the lone genizah fragment, involves a precedent-setting cause c6l1bre in the early sixteenth century, prior to 1513, not in an Ottoman land, but in Mamluk Egypt. It concerned the nagid, Isaac Shulal. One of the respondents tells it as follows: The incident occurred in the following way: Reuben vowed, saying, "I am hereby a Samson nazirite if Simeon becomes a judge!" The said Reuben is nagid, and has the power to prevent Simeon from becoming a judge. Subse- quently, the nagid sought to appoint someone else judge instead of Simeon, and did not find anyone. He regretted the vow he had made, and all the rabbis in Egypt [or: Cairo] gathered in order to seek a release from that vow.22 It is certain that Shulal's case, though it had no antecedent in the halakhic literature, nevertheless reflected popular practice. That this is in fact the case is indicated by the genizah fragment (for the details of which see below) and by Jacob ibn Habib, a contemporary of Shulal writing in Salonica, who attests to its widespread use, specifically in Egypt and its envi- rons, as opposed to other lands. "I heard from a trustworthy rabbi, who dwelt in an area near the kingdom of Egypt, that it is a common practice on 22. Elijah Mizrahi, Sh. u-T. R.

(I would like to thank Dr. Avraham David, of the Institute for Manuscript Microfilming at the University and National Library, Jerusalem, for this reference, which is referred to also by Benayahu; see below. And I would also like to thank the Jewish Theological Seminary Library for the use of its microfilm of this MS.)

The views expressed by the original respondents reverberate throughout the literature. The terminus ad quem of 1513 is based on the evidence gathered by Benayahu, op. cit., p. 90. Benayahu himself suggests that the event occurred circa 1510, though he brings no evidence for preferring that date over 1513.</page><page sequence="8">230 SAMUEL MORELL everyone's tongue. Whenever one wishes to proscribe something forever, without possibility of release, he says, 'If I do so I am hereby a Samson nazirite."'23 NOt long afterward there is evidence of the vow's widespread, grass-roots popularity, and of its disruptive potential, the nature of which will become clear from the many examples of its use below.24 VI Is there evidence of the intention of really becoming a Samson nazirite? In the many incidences of this vow which are recorded in sixteenth-century responsa, I have found only one which may reflect an honest intention to fulfill the vow. Reuben lay on a sickbed, and he came to talk with Simeon about whether he would attend Judah's wedding. Reuben jumped and said, "I hereby take upon myself the Samson naziriteship of Samson ... husband of Delilah, if I go to Judah's wedding!" Now, may our Master instruct us, whether naziriteship will fall upon Reuben if he goes to Judah's wedding, or not.25 The phrase "jumped and said" occurs frequently to indicate a sudden decision. It appears that what Reuben was saying is: "If I live to go to the wedding, I will become a nazirite!" If so, the vow, if fulfilled, would be one of thanksgiving. Subsequently, Reuben did live, but for some reason he was not able to attend the wedding, and was seeking a release from his vow. This is not the only possible construction of the event, but it is probable, and the only case which has come to my attention which is subject to such a con- struction. 23. MS Bodl. 834 (see previous note), p. 98a. His subsequent remarks reinforce this under- standing and function of the Samson nazirite vow among the populace. 24. See Zeqan Aharon, no. 178, Radbaz, no. 983, and Maharshadam, Y.D., no. 134, which refer to attempts to proscribe its use by communal legislation. The author of Zeqan Aharon, Elijah ha-Levi, died after 1540, according to the Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971), Vol. 6 col. 646. In Maharshadam it is ascribed to "the early ones," referring no doubt to the early part of the century. See also Radbaz, no. 136, and Maharshadam, Y.D., no. 83, where explicit mention is made of its popularity. The most eloquent evidence of this popularity is the large number of responsa referring to the subject throughout the century, the largest concentration being those of Moses Trani, forty-six in number. 25. Samuel Qal'i, Mishpetai Shemuel (Venice, 1599), no. 7.</page><page sequence="9">NAZIRITE VOW IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 231 Can the actual existence of a Samson nazirite be documented? There are a few rulings by Abi Zimra to the effect that the principal, having violated the condition he had stipulated, has in fact incurred the Samson nazirite- ship.26 One of these cases, which is interesting in itself, will serve to illustrate the issue. You asked, my friend, about Reuben, who said, "I am hereby a Samson nazir- ite if I accept any benefit from my father!" He transgressed and enjoyed bene- fit, but he said that he was under duress. He was in a certain village, where there were no Jews except his father. He had nothing to eat, and ate from what belonged to his father. Abi Zimra challenges the fact of duress, and rules stringently.27 One is left wondering about the nature of the feud that could have produced such a vow, in view of the apparent relationship between the two, who traveled together, alone save for each other's company, apparently on business. A responsum of Samuel de Medina also rules that someone who violated the condition he had stipulated is considered a Samson nazirite.28 Another case of De Medina's which could well have led to a Samson naziriteship con- cerns "Simeon," who was engaged to the sister of his brother "Reuben's" wife. Simeon broke the engagement and sought to marry another. Reuben, for purposes of family honor, tried to pressure him, and foolishly said that he would be a Samson nazirite if his brother carried through his marriage to the other woman. De Medina finds no way out for him but the moral per- suasion of Simeon, a weak reed indeed.29 The problem with all these cases is that we have no way of knowing if the stringent ruling was actually fol- lowed. In light of the overall lack of evidence of Samson naziriteship in prac- tice, one tends to think not. It is particularly interesting that such is not the case with regard to the standard nazirite. Though rare, there is evidence for his existence. Moses Trani, in Safed, writes: God brought it about that there came before me a certain nazirite, who had 26. Radbaz, nos. 221, 314, 694. 27.

But he was not able to contain himself in his naziriteship, and was wasting away with asceticism and physical distress, "having sinned upon his soul." And he asked me about being released from his naziriteship, and [requested] that I should release him.30 Trani, in describing the ascetic rigors besetting the man, makes reference to Numbers 6:11, "having sinned upon his soul," which is interpreted in the Talmud as an objection to asceticism.3' The reference is particularly apt in this instance, because the man had taken ascetic vows which he could not live up to. The nazirite had come to Palestine, following the ruling of Mai- monides that a nazirite has to go to Palestine to practice his naziriteship.32 The context suggests specifically a standard nazirite. In any case, that is explicitly the situation with Trani's nazirite.33 VII What was the motivation behind the Samson nazirite vow? We have already observed that no cases have come to our attention in which a Sam- son naziriteship is undertaken out of a straightforward religious drive to consecrate oneself to God, though there were occasional instances of that with regard to standard naziriteship. We saw a lone case in which a Samson nazirite vow was apparently part of a prayer for recovery from illness. The remainder of the sixteenth-century cases can be divided into three broad categories: (1)those undertaken in sudden emotion; (2) those which were premeditated, with a specific end in mind other than the vow itself; (3) those in which the vow had become institutionalized as a normative legal instru- ment in the formulation of contracts. These will be discussed in turn. 1. The most elemental motivation behind the Samson nazirite vow is sudden emotion, almost always of anger. In this regard it is similar to the 30.

Two examples will illustrate the point. You asked me about a woman who had sewed a garment for her husband, and he didn't like it, and quarreled with her. She said, "I am hereby a nazirite like Samson that I won't mend another garment for you!" . . . And the woman is not regretful at all.34 Reuben got into a quarrel with his wife. In the course of the argument, she said to him, "Only most of my children are yours!" When he heard what she said, he got angry, and jumped and said, "I take upon myself by the Samson nazir- iteship that I won't join with you from today for three years!"'35 A relatively large number of Samson nazirite vows are of this type. An anonymous respondent testifies: There are many untutored people nowadays who cannot control their spirit. When their ruling spirit gets control of them, they jump and vow in this way. When their anger boils over, they find peace and respite for their soul, think- ing that they have already cast the die, and no one can reverse it according to the laws of Persia and Media.36 The phenomenon was not restricted, however, to "untutored people." We find Jacob Berav using a Samson nazirite vow in the course of an argument, though the details of the vow are not reported.37 In one example, involving a child, the emotion is fear rather than anger. The case, unique in the mechanics which are employed in formulating the vow, is interesting also because of its social background, and the inter- personal relationships which it implies. 34.

His mother and the [other] members of the family frightened him, threatening to inform on him to his teacher, so that the latter would forbid him to drink wine except with the permission of his mother. The lad knows some passages of Mishnah by heart, though he doesn't understand them too well unless he were to sit and think some time about what comes out of his mouth-and even then only so-so. When the lad saw that they wanted to forbid him from drinking wine, he recited by heart the mishnah "What is the difference between a lifetime nazirite and a Samson nazirite?" etc., to its conclusion.38 When he finished the mishnah, he declared to those standing there, "I'm already a nazirite!" His mother asked him, "Until when did you vow?" He answered, "Until I get mar- ried"; then he recanted and said, "For three years."'39 2. The second broad category consists of vows which were premeditat- ed, with the purpose of achieving a certain end for which the vow was mere- ly the incidental means. The most basic motivation for this type of vow is the attempt of the vower to modify his behavior. We find it used as an incentive to refrain from transgression.40 A man who had been forced by circumstances to violate the Sabbath during a journey to Egypt vowed never to travel to Egypt again by land. The question was whether the vow included the return journey.4' A case which involves an attempt to reestablish domestic harmony has inter- esting implications for social history. This concerns Reuben, who was being urged by the townsfolk to customarily dine with them. [As a result,] "there was peace in the world and quarreling between him and his wife."42 For this reason, he swore a Samson naziriteship, with all its conditions, that if two people were eating, he would not be the third if it were not in his own home. 38.

Such was the case in the situation reflected in the genizah fragment. A man and his wife had been trying to induce her mother to leave their house and go home so that they could settle their differences between themselves. The man declares, "When I saw that she [i.e., his wife] pleaded so much and she did not want to go, I jumped in my anger-my intention being to threaten and frighten my mother-in-law to go and leave me, so that I may be calmed from the con- troversy-and said as follows: 'I undertake the naziriteship of Samson son of [Manoah] husband of Delilah, with all its conditions, not to leave her alone during the Sabbath!"'44 We have seen an example of this above, in the case of the man who want- ed to prevent his brother from breaking his engagement to his sister-in- law.45 A number of incidents which fall into this grouping are attempts by husbands to pressure their wives into allowing them to take a second wife by vowing to become Samson nazirites unless they consent. It was customary for brides to protect themselves against such an eventuality by having a clause inserted in the marriage contract necessitating their consent for a second wife, and it is not surprising that men would attempt to intimidate their wives to obtain their consent.46 In other situations, we twice find the Samson nazirite vow being applied 43. Mabit, II no. 168. 44. Weiss, p. 100. The text of the vow is in Judeo-Spanish, and the translation of it here is taken from that in the article. The author writes in a note, "The last three words are uncertain." 45. See above, text to n. 29. 46. See Radbaz, no. 436; ibid., no. 115 (= Mabit, I, no. 152); E. Shochetman, ed., Sh. u-T Rabbenu Meir Gavizon Zatsal (Jerusalem, 1985), no. 2. Regarding this clause in the marriage contract as it functioned in fourteenth-century Spain, see Y. Asis, "Herem de-Rabbenu Ger- shom ve-Nisuei Kefel be-Sefarad" [The ban of Rabbenu Gershom and plural marriages in Spain], Tsiyon 46 (1981): 264-266, and the summary of the literature on the issue in general, n. 98 there. Of particular interest is the case dealt with by Joseph Caro, A vqat Rokhel (Leipzig, 1859), no. 178, and by Moses Trani, Mabit, I, no. 104. Caro's is the fuller account. The situa- tion there implies a custom which allows polygyny with the wife's consent, but forbids it with- out her consent, even though there is no clause to that effect in the marriage contract. For other cases in which the Samson nazirite vow is used to elicit consent for a second wife, see Mabit, III, no. 65; Radbaz, no. 436.</page><page sequence="14">236 SAMUEL MORELL to pressure one's father; in one case to divorce his wife,47 in another to dis- miss a certain servant.48 In one incident, a man who had quarreled with his brother's partner uses it to force his brother to split the partnership.49 The following story is of interest because of its "soap opera" quality: A young man, one of our people, carried on with a married woman. He became so impassioned with her in licentious talk50 that he took upon himself the Samson naziriteship that he would never5' marry another woman save her. And such were his words letter for letter, word for word: "I take the Samson naziriteship, upon the consent of the Ministering Angels,52 to never marry another woman if it be not you."53 Thus he said three times.54 And she said that she would act in such a way that her husband would divorce her, if he would promise her that he would marry her ... But the woman was not divorced. After two years had passed the young man married, and she remained married. After the young man married, she became widowed, and married someone else. May our Master instruct us whether his words have weight, and if the naziriteship falls upon him.55 Since neither of them apparently cared anymore, one is left wondering who brought the question to the court's attention after a period of years. Some Samson nazirite vows were designed to create a situation which would necessitate or preclude a certain outcome. For instance, one seeking to evade mandatory election to public office would take a Samson nazirite vow precluding his serving in that capacity.56 A faction of a congregation might seek to force the resignation of the rabbi by vowing a Samson nazirite 47.

They drew up a docu- ment, and had it notarized, affirming that they had taken upon themselves the Samson naziriteship were he to be reinstated. Some of them later claimed that the document was merely a ruse, and that the people had not really pronounced the Samson nazirite vow out loud; and, furthermore, that the notarizing judges were aware of this.58 We find the Samson nazirite vow used this way in domestic situations as well. A man wanted to divorce his wife and pay her her ketubbah payments. Her relatives were insisting, however, that he add to the designated sum. One must assume that their leverage derived from a clause in the marriage contract curtailing his right to divorce her without her consent.59' To ward off such pressure, and to preclude the possibility of a court of arbitration finding in their favor, he vowed a Samson nazirite vow not to add a cent to what he was obliged to pay her according to the law.60 The vow is used to mitigate pressure to marry a specific woman. In one case a man had been bound by oath to marry someone, but because of certain events he con- sidered the oath null. However, in order to protect himself against a claim that the oath was binding, he swore to marry another woman, and vowed a Samson nazirite vow to neither seek nor accept a release from that oath. We see here another stage in the emphasis on irrevocability.6' We find Samson nazirite vows which were undertaken at the instigation of another party. A man had betrothed a second wife. Submitting to pres- sure brought to bear by his first wife's relatives, he vowed a neder in which he forbade himself the pleasure of intercourse with the second woman; and vowed a Samson nazirite vow to abide by this neder all his life. Subsequently the first wife died, and the question revolves around the continued validity 57. E.g., Maharshadam, Y D., no. 80. 58. Ibn Lev, I, no. 43, p. 118b. 59. Such a clause was current in this period. Among Ashkenazic Jews, of course, the need for the wife's consent was automatic, deriving from another enactment of Rabbenu Gershom. 60.

He then demanded that his son personally undertake the same vow, on pain of being cut off and refused admission to his house if he refrained from doing so.63 In a number of instances, real intimidation is used in extracting a Sam- son nazirite vow, the legal questionability of such vows notwithstanding. "Reuben," who was a man of power and violence, and who had influence with the gentile authorities, had robbed "Simeon," and then intimidated Simeon into swearing, using the Samson nazirite vow, among others, that he would not expose Reuben's wrongdoing to the community.64 In Aleppo, "Reuben," had been removed from the office of sheikh, and "Simon" installed in his stead. Reuben seized the position from him with threats, and forced him to take a Samson nazirite vow that he would not assume the position of sheikh in Aleppo.65 A man had become impoverished, and his creditors had him placed in debtors' prison. His father came from abroad and managed to obtain his temporary release. But when they sought to leave the country, the creditors threatened to have them tortured and beaten, and summoned the police to have them jailed again. Then, having thus estab- lished their credibility, the creditors told the father and son that they would call off the authorities if they took a Samson nazirite vow not to leave town. Needless to say, they fled anyway, and the question involves the validity of the vow.66 In a case involving two rival and feuding synagogues, some members of one, who had connections with the gentile authorities, used them to force an effective leader of the other to switch to their synagogue, and to lend permanance to this change by a Samson nazirite vow.67 In an incident indicative of the extent to which the Samson nazirite vow had infil- trated society, and indeed had become normative, a court which had ordered a man to divorce his wife is suspected of enforcing its decision by imposing a Samson nazirite vow on the husband if he did not heed the court order.68 62.

The third category of Samson nazirite vows represents the institu- tionalization of the vow as a normative legal instrument. It consists of for- mal agreements, whether oral or written, often carefully formulated in legal terminology, in which the Samson nazirite vow, frequently added to a sequence of other vows, is incorporated as a sanction for violation. We find the vow in contracts establishing a commercial partnership,69 and in con- tracts for the hiring of rabbis and cantors.70 There are a number of cases in which it is used to enforce a residence agreement imposed by the bride's family on the groom.7' We find in this connection a couple undergoing the legal fiction of a divorce and remarriage in order to evade the consequences of the vow, which referred only to the original marriage.72 The vow is used to ensure compliance in advance with arbitration decisions.73 In a particularly interesting case, a teacher had his student swear that he would study only with him, unless he received permission from his master to study with another; and, furthermore, that he would not cease his studies until he reached the age of twenty. The oath was reinforced with the sanction of a Samson nazirite vow, and was incorporated in a formal document.74 VIII The examples cited up to this point allow a fair idea of thie range of pur- poses for which the Samson nazirite vow was used. There are two broad areas, however, in which there is a particular concentration of such vows. 69. See text to n. 21.

Many examples have been cited above. The vow was used to reinforce the husband's commitment to obtain his wife's approval before marrying a rival. In one case, the possibil- ity of exception by way of the wife's consent was not indicated, but the respondent ruled that it nevertheless applied.75 In a more unusual situation, a man who had betrothed a minor agreed to refrain from taking another wife during the years she was growing up, until the actual marriage. Perhaps the further limitation of not taking one at all without her consent would have been part of an agreement at the time of the wedding.76 We saw above a case in which a woman's relatives forced her husband to forswear a rival whom he had already betrothed but not yet married.77 On the other hand, we have seen how the vow was sometimes used to pressure a wife into con- senting to a rival.'7 We find vows never to marry a certain woman,79 and vows to divorce a wife."8 In an unusual case, a man sought to bring pressure on his brother-in- law to return a "borrowed" article by vowing to divorce the latter's sister unless he did so.81 On the other hand, in one case a man vowed not to divorce his betrothed for a period of ten years.82 In the case of a woman seeking a divorce, her husband vowed to divorce her if she forfeited her ketubbah payments."3 Closely related to the vow to divorce, and even more prevalent, are vows to abstain from sexual relations with one's wife, or from dwelling together under one roof with her. It is often indicated explicitly that the vow was undertaken in anger as the result of a quarrel. In one case the vow is to not live with her and not divorce her.84 Sometimes a specified period of time is 75. Mabit, I, n. 101. 76. Alsheikh, no. 13.

It happened that words of quarrel and strife passed between a man and his wife, because she wanted to do something without his permission. He said to her, "If you do this, I hereby take upon myself a Samson naziriteship that I will not live with you until such-and-such a time!" She, however, violated the order of her husband and did that thing. When he saw that she had violated and transgressed his command, he separated himself from her, and established his dwelling place in a store which he had long possessed for his work, which was next to the house in which his wife dwelt. There was a wall separating them, but there was a window in the wall, through which she would look to inquire as to his welfare and to speak endearingly with him.86 Through there87 he would enter to eat and drink and sleep and nap. After some days88 within the designated time, he regretted the vow he had taken upon himself. Is there a release from this vow or not?89 The second broad area in which there is a concentration of Samson nazirite vows is the area of communal affairs. Moses Trani records a number of cases where quarreling and factionalism in a synagogue lead someone to make a Samson nazirite vow not to pray there as long as the aggrieving party remains associated with the congregation.90 Elsewhere we 85.

He later claimed that he had never actually made the vow, and had signed the document under the threat that he would be informed on for having forbidden the use of govern- ment courts.94 A few responsa reflect a situation in which people unwilling to serve as communal officials make Samson nazirite vows that they will not serve. Two responsa, one by Elijah ha-Levia95 and the other by Jacob Berav,96 mention a communal ordinance prohibiting nominees from refusing to serve. Berav refers to the frequency of a vow to this effect in Egypt, and it is possible that the unwillingness to serve reflects the unstable and unsafe conditions in Mamluk Egypt.97 However, this does not seem to be the case with Elijah ha-Levi, who was writing in Constantinople, and whose question clearly indicates that some immediate event precipitated the vow.98 The two other cases of the vow used for this purpose which have come to my attention are by Joseph Taitazak, in Salonica,99 and later in the century by Joseph ibn 91.

IX In many of the examples of the Samson nazirite vow which have been cited, one niay well have noticed an incongruity in the syntax with which it is proposed. A sentence such as that uttered by the woman who was upset by her husband's criticism of her sewing, "I am hereby a nazirite like Samson that I won't mend another garment for you!"''l is incomprehensible in terms of its literal meaning. The same syntactic feature is already evident in the genizah fragment. "I am hereby a nazirite like Samson that" really means, "I hereby swear that"; the phrase "that I won't" is the terminology of a shevu'ah. In fact, that is precisely how it was understood by the masses. The woman, of course, did not recite her vow in Hebrew, but in la'az, that is, the "vernacular," meaning Judeo-Spanish. This does not change the matter. Abi Zimra tells us, "I am well versed in the language of la'az, and most of the time people express naziriteship in the terminology of a shevu'ah."'02 An insight into the function of the Samson nazirite vow can be gained by a consideration of one of Joseph ibn Lev's responsa. Reuben had taken a conditional Samson nazirite vow to assure Simeon, his close friend, that he would not reveal a certain secret which Simeon had confided to him alone. In the course of time, however, Reuben did reveal the secret. After having subsequently suffered bad fortune, he reviewed his actions, and came to the conclusion that he was being punished by Heaven for having broken his oath to Simeon. Seeking penance, he thereupon vowed, again invoking Samson the nazirite, that when he went to dwell in the Holy Land, in Jerusa- lem or Safed, he would become a (standard) nazirite. Now he wishes to go to Palestine, but is afraid that if he does so he will have to be a nazirite. And that would be unbearable for him, because he can't stand not shaving even on the intermediate days of the festivals!'03 It is clear that the Samson nazir- 100. Ibn Lev, III, no. 52. 101.

The fact that this religiously motivated questioner was apparently clean-shaven is worthy of note.</page><page sequence="22">244 SAMUEL MORELL ite vow and the standard nazirite vow serve two totally different purposes.'04 The former is merely a form of oath. In describing his violation of Simeon's confidence, he describes himself as having violated "the shevu'ah of the naziriteship!" Elijah ha-Levi dealt with the question of the man who had declared "by the Samson naziriteship" that he would not live with his wife. Says the respondent, "It appears that he made the Samson naziriteship like a scroll of the Torah, by which to swear."''5 Indeed, that is precisely what he did! This helps us understand why the Samson nazirite vow was never taken seriously by the laity as a form of naziriteship. It had totally lost its original sense. What it did retain was the notion that there is no release from a Samson nazirite vow. In the question presented to ibn Lev, about the man who had taken a Samson nazirite vow not to serve the community, the fol- lowing explanation was proffered as a suggested avenue for release: For this man Reuben is not learned in Torah. He stated that he had never intended to be a nazirite like Samson, though he knows that Samson was a nazirite. His intention was to swear a strict shevu'ah, one for which there would be no release. He thought that if he related'06 his shevu'ah to the Samson naziriteship, then that shevu'ah and that neder would have no release.'07 In general, the ignorance of the meaning of the Samson naziriteship among those who swore by it is a persistent theme. On a few occasions, we find the expression bar delilah, "son of Delilah," substituted for ba'al delilah, "hus- band of Delilah."''8 The chasm between the popular conception of the Samson nazirite vow and the rabbinic conception of it is aptly exemplified in a responsum con- 104. The genizah fragment exhibits a similar dichotomy. The writer says that he had origin- ally undertaken a standard naziriteship in connection with his son's illness, apparently as part of a prayer for his recuperation. The second naziriteship, reflected in the text quoted above, is a Samson naziriteship, and serves a rather different purpose, as we have seen. Goitein's merging of the two in Mediterranean Society, vol. 5, p. 110, needs to be corrected. 105. Zeqan Aharon, no. 182; similarly ibid., no. 36. 106. meqabbel u-meyahes. 107. Ibn Lev, III, no. 52.

When a man dies without children, his brother must either marry the widow or release her in a ceremony called halitsah. However, in situations in which the levirate marriage would result in an incestuous relationship (e.g., in the case of a man who marries his brother's daughter, which is permissible in Jewish law), the widow is free not only of the requirement of the marriage option, but of the requirement of the halitsah option as well. The principle is, "whoever is liable to levirate mar- riage is liable to halitsah; and whoever is not liable to levirate marriage is not liable to halitsah."'09 Abi Zimra was asked "concerning a man who vowed by the Samson naziriteship that he will not marry his sister-in-law, whether she requires halitsah or not, because since she is not liable for levirate mar- riage, she is not liable for halitsah.""0 The Samson nazirite vow is seen here as having the effect of nullifying the option of levirate marriage, not only in practice, because one wants to avoid the onus of being a nazirite, but in prin- ciple. One cannot perform levirate marriage, just as one cannot perform it if it would produce an incestuous relationship. This is because it was con- ceived as an oath not to marry her, without any conditional aspect to it."' Abi Zimra, however, in answering the question, looks at it from a halakhic perspective and finds the question incomprehensible. Why, after all, can he not marry her and be a nazirite? As elsewhere, Abi Zimra posits the possibil- ity of such a person actually being liable to naziriteship.12 In a cause c616bre regarding a dispute between two rabbis over control of a congregation, the disputants agreed to abide by the decision of a court of arbitration. They were first both made to swear that they would abide by the decision. The oath which was imposed on them carried the following sanc- tion: "whoever transgresses anything mentioned above will be in violation of the herem of Achan son of Carmi, etc., and will be obliged to observe the naziriteship of Samson son of Manoah, husband of Delilah, with all its 109.

The herem of Achan, used as it is here, is not a halakhic category, but, if you will, an aggadic category. It draws its strength from its suggestiveness, from the overtones it conveys to the imagination. It serves the psychological purpose of heaping the most awful curses one atop the other in order to ensure compliance; one shudders to think what might be alluded to by the ominous "etc." The Samson naziriteship, in the popular mind, is parallel to this. X The rabbis were, of course, well aware of the popular conception of the Samson nazirite vow. But they were forced by the nature of their task to approach it in terms of its halakhic conception. Since they knew that in any case their "clients" had never had any intention of living the life of a Samson nazirite, and would never think of actually doing so regardless of their rul- ings, the rabbis were anxious to find an avenue of escape, if for no other reason than to protect people from living in sin. Of course, for the question- ers, the real question in these cases was whether they were obliged to uphold the condition they had specified, for which the Samson naziriteship was an assurance. A stringent rabbinical ruling rarely means, "You must be a Samson nazirite.""4 It nearly always means, "You must uphold the condi- tion you stipulated." But the reasons for requesting release were often good ones. For other vows there was a release mechanism, and only a technicality distinguished this form of vow from the others. A technical solution was therefore sought. There were, of course, differences among rabbis in the extent to which they were willing to accommodate to the realities of popular 113.

One must also bear in mind that always in the background is the urgency with which they viewed the particular case before them. We will attempt to describe the major halakhic issues which underlie the treatment of the Samson nazirite vow, and sketch the lines of opinion which formed concerning them. XI It will be recalled that the earliest case on record which is subject to approximate dating is the case of the nagid, Isaac Shulal, who had sworn, "I am hereby a Samson nazirite if so-and-so becomes a judge!" The frame of reference in the ensuing debate was defined by Jacob Berav."5 The Mishnah, as it stands before us, reads: "I am hereby like Samson, like the son of Manoah, like the husband of Delilah, like him who uprooted the gates of Gaza, like him whose eyes the Philistines gouged out-he is a Samson nazirite." The Talmud explains why all these defining phrases are necessary: "For if he were to say, 'I am hereby like Samson,' one would think [that he refers to] another Samson; so we are told, 'like the son of Manoah.' And if he were to teach [only], 'like the son of Manoah,' one would think there is someone [else] who is named thus. So we are told, 'like the husband of Delilah' and 'like him whose eyes the Philistines gouged out' [or: 'like the husband of Delilah and like... ']."l6 Given the Mishnah alone, one would have interpreted it to mean that any of the phrases indicated there would suffice to define the speaker as a Samson nazirite. The Talmud, however, makes such an interpretation impossible. It seems that one would have to include all the defining charac- teristics which the Talmud deems necessary. "Samson," or even "Samson son of Manoah," is not sufficient in itself. The Talmud does not indicate, however, whether "one would think [that he refers to] another Samson" because the phrase "Samson," or "Samson son of Manoah," is inherently ambiguous, or because the vower now asserts that in fact he did not refer to Samson the biblical nazirite, and that his 115. For the sources for Berav's view, see n. 22 above. 116. Mishnah Nazir 1:2; B.T. Nazir 4a.</page><page sequence="26">248 SAMUEL MORELL original intention was to give a false impression."7 This is a crucial point in terms of the practicality of Samson nazirite vows in which the vower admits that he referred to Samson the nazirite. A related point is that the Mishnah does not represent the vower as saying, "I am hereby a nazirite like Sam- son," only: "I am hereby like Samson.""i What would be the effect of the mention of the term "nazirite" on the claim that he referred to another Samson, whether that claim is seen as emanating from the vower or from us his interpreters? Here the realities do not help the seeker of leniencies. The normal vower does in fact mention the term "nazirite." These issues form the crux of the debate that ensued in the wake of the Shulal case, and the various positions reverberate throughout the century. Berav himself took the most lenient stand. He held that the term "Samson son of Manoah," and certainly "Samson" alone, was inherently indefinite in its connotation. Even if the vower admitted that his intention really was to be a nazirite like Samson the biblical nazirite, his words do not convey that sense unambiguously. This is so, according to Berav, even if the term "nazir- ite" is used in the vow."9 The diametrically opposed view was urged by Jacob ibn Habib.'20 Habib interpreted the talmudic discussion to refer only to a case in which the vower himself asserts that he referred to another Samson; this he cannot do once he specifies the required designations. But if he himself raises no such claim, the mention of "Samson" alone binds him. Furthermore, his vow is effective even if he does not mention the term "nazirite" in the vow. Throughout the century, respondents took their positions in relationshio to these poles. Among the earlier scholars, Joseph Taitazak and Joseph Fasi adopted the lenient view espoused by Berav. Nothing is known of the details of Fasi's thinking; his student, Samuel 'Atya, was already unaware of it, and tried to build a case for his teacher's position.12' Taitazak's views, on the other hand, have survived in a responsum on another case revolving around 117. Compare Mishnah Nedarim 2:5, where this type of deviousness is posited. 118. So our version, hareini ke-shimshon. But in the text presented in the responsum by Samuel 'Atya, Feldman, p. 13, the word "nazirite" is included: hareini nazir ke-shimshon. 119. Caro, in Kesef Mishneh to Code, Naziriteship 3:15, however, maintains that Berav refrained from issuing a practical ruling on the basis of his own lenient stand. 120.

He states that he would have invalidated all Samson nazirite vows which were conditional, but was precluded from doing so by Maimonides' ruling. Nevertheless, he feels that certain avenues for leniency, deriving from the precluded position, should nonetheless be exploited.'23 In the next generation Moses Trani endorsed the lenient positions of Berav and Taitazak.'24 Isaac Adarbi and Moses Alsheikh took a more intermediate position, using the argument only in conjunction with another which led toward a lenient ruling.'25 Against this array of authorities there was considerable opposition. Habib's son, Levi ibn Habib, echoes his father's ruling. His questioner had testified that there was indeed a custom in his place of invalidating Samson nazirite vows when the designations were omitted, but Levi ibn Habib rejects it, and urges that it be abandoned.'26 Joseph Caro rejects Berav in favor of ibn Habib, in spite of the fact that the former was his teacher.'27 Joseph ibn Lev takes a similar stance.'28 There was an intermediate position, suggested by Elijah Mizrahi, which distinguished between whether or not the word "nazirite" was used in the vow. Only when the term was omitted, as it is in the Mishnah, was there a necessity to specify the various designations. When the vow mentioned "nazirite" specifically, however, the vow would be binding without the designations.'29 Since everyone in fact mentioned the term, this view, on a practical level, is identical with the stringent position. It is reflected by Elijah ha-Levi,'30 Tam ibn Yihyeh,'3' Samuel Qal'i,132 and Abi Zimra.'33 122. Benayahu, pp. 88-96. Cited in part by his student, De Medina, Maharshadam, Y.D., no. 76. 123.

A shevu'ah, which establishes a personal prohibition regarding a specific action, has as its subject the one taking the oath: "By the God of Israel! [or: it is an oath!] I will not eat any meat in the world!" A neder, which renders the use of an object forbidden, has as its subject the forbidden object. The latter is typi- cally likened, by way of metaphor, to a sacrificial offering or to some other consecrated object which is forbidden for private use: "All the meat in the world is a sacrificial offering to me!" or, in the usual Hebrew syntax, "A sacrificial offering to me is all the meat in the world!" In fact, the neder, as it is defined here, is conceptually an extension of the notion of a votive offer- ing, which is also called neder.'35 It would seem, therefore, that the termino- logy of each is distinct, and an interchanging of terminology would render either one meaningless. In fact, however, a perusal of tannaitic examples indicates that the terminology was thoroughly intermingled in use. The Talmud employs the concept of substitute terms for neder and shevu'ah, and the exchanging of terminology can be seen as falling into that category. Thus, in a declaration such as "A sacrificial offering to me that I will not eat any meat in the world!" the phrase "a sacrificial offering" can be seen as a substitute for "it is an oath!"'36 The view presented above is precisely the view expressed by Nah- manides,'37 but there were many who disagreed. Nissim of Gerondi cites the early authorities Hananel and Joseph ibn Migash as supporting the opposite view, as well as Solomon ibn Adret.'38 According to them, a substitution of terminology of the type described above would render the vow invalid. The terminology customarily employed for the Samson nazirite vow was problematic. The difficulty lay not with the makeup of the phrase involving the naziriteship itself, but with the way the phrase was used in the context of 134. See text to n. 2. 135.

The rabbis generally defined a statement such as "I am hereby a Samson nazirite that I won't mend another garment for you!" (instead of, "If I mend . . .") as a neder utilizing the terminology of a shevu'ah, and brought to bear on it the controversy described above.139 Those who inclined toward leniency dis- counted Nahmanides as a minority opinion. These include Tam ibn Yihyeh, Samuel de Medina, and Moses Trani.140 Those who rule stringently, in addi- tion to citing Nahmanides, refer also to a comment by Asher ben Yehiel, made in another context, that a naziriteship bears the identifying charac- teristics of a shevu'ah.'41 They thus exclude naziriteship altogether from the rule that a neder, to be valid, cannot be formulated as a shevu'ah. An out- spoken exponent of this view is Abi Zimra, who often alludes to Asher's view without attribution, presenting it as a generally accepted opinion.'42 There are those who dismiss Nahmanides altogether, but then rule strin- gently, citing the above comment of Asher ben Yehiel.143 A few respondents are willing to rule leniently on this issue only when there is another question- able aspect to the vow, such as the failure to specify Samson's various identi- fying designations.'44 XIII The disparity between the solemn implications of the wording of an oath and its true intent and purpose was a feature of swearing with which the sages of the Talmud were well aware. The Mishnah states as follows: "Four 139. On the other hand, one may argue that it is the latter part of the sentence which is problematic, while the first part of the sentence, the acceptance of naziriteship, remains intact. Such a view is expressed by Elijah ha-Levi, Zeqan Aharon, no. 65, p. 49d bottom; and by Moses Trani, Mabit, II, no. 15, p. 6c, who would simply reinterpret the latter phrase as a conditional statement. 140.

One of the four, vows of exaggeration, does not figure in the discus- sion of the Samson nazirite vow. The other three do. 1. A high percentage of the vows discussed in this study are meant to encourage the vow-maker or others to do something. Are they "vows of incentive"? As an example of a nonbinding vow of incentive, the Talmud brings the case of a man who uses a vow to encourage a reluctant guest to accept an invitation.146 The principle inherent in this example could conceiv- ably be applied broadly to cover a wide range of the vows described in the course of this study. There was, however, an earlier authority, Yeruham ben Meshullam, who had ruled that it should be limited to the specific example cited, and not extended to similar situations.147 The respondents who dealt with the Samson nazirite vow were in disagreement about the issue. The most outstanding statement in favor of extension is found in an anonymous responsum. The respondent distinguished between vows in which the condition was desirable, with the consequence that the resultant vow has a desired effect (e.g., "I will be a nazirite if a son is born to me"), and conditional vows in which the condition is undesirable, and the inten- tion was to avoid the consequences of the vow, as in all the examples cited in this study, save possibly one. Vows of the latter type he ruled not binding, by reason of being vows of incentive.148 This approach, if accepted, would have cut the Gordian knot. That, however, was not to be. Tam ibn Yihyeh, in a reference to this responsum, dismisses it casually, without troubling to argue it on its merits: "When you look into the matter carefully, you discover that their words have no substance." He then quotes from the anonymous responsum, and concludes, "It seems that the author of this opinion did not fully understand the matter of vows of incentive."'49 We find this debate continuing in the generation following the period under study, in a respon- 145.

Abi Zimra dealt with a case in which a man swore to divorce his wife or be a Samson nazirite, unless she agreed to visit his rela- tives. The rule is, says Abi Zimra, that we accept a man's word about his motivations for a vow. "And since he himself says that it was his intention neither to divorce his wife nor be a nazirite, but to encourage her to do his bidding out of fear that he would divorce her, his vow is classified as a vow of incentive.""' Joseph Caro expressed a similar view, in the case of a man who tried to pressure his wife into accepting a rival.'52 On the other hand, Samuel de Medina ruled strictly on this issue, citing Yeruham ben Meshul- lam's refusal to extend the principle of vows of incentive beyond the specific examples in the Talmud.'53 2. The next of the "four types of vows the sages permitted" which comes under consideration is "vows of error." The Mishnah gives three exam- ples.'54 The first does not concern us; it deals with a violation of the vow through error. The second example is a case in which the motivation for the vow is mentioned explicitly, and turns out to be based on error. The third example is similar; the vow was motivated by a false presumption of fact.'55 There are a few responsa which bring to bear on the case at hand the category of "vows of error," though the situation does not always accord closely with the examples cited above. We will describe two cases in which there is such a similarity. One confronted Samuel de Medina. A congrega- tion hired a rabbi, backing the contract with a Samson nazirite vow, and subsequently discovered that he was incompetent. De Medina judges the vow to be a vow of error, since it was based on a false presumption of fact.'56 150. Gavizon's view, Sh. u-T. R.

They maintained that they had only been joking. Moses Trani con- siders it a vow of error. Were it an ordinary vow, he says, we would insist on a formal release as a rabbinically imposed stringency. But since the Samson naziriteship is not subject to release, he rules that the vow is simply not bind- ing, according to the original law of the Talmud.'57 Abi Zimra, however, in dealing with the same case, declines to classify it as a vow of error, because no one jokes about such matters, and furthermore, the man's anger could have been anticipated even if he had known that the relatives were not serious. 58 Other responsa take the definition of "vow of error" further afield. Elijah ha-Levi rules that the vower's ignorance of the halakhic meaning of naziriteship renders the vow a vow of error,159 and Abi Zimra uses a similar argument in conjunction with others.'60 Elijah ha-Levi discusses the case of a man who made a Samson nazirite vow that he would neither live with his wife nor divorce her.'6' This, of course, put him in violation of the Torah, which obligates a man to live with his wife. Ha-Levi discusses the argument that the vow itself is not contrary to the Torah, because theoretically he can both live with her and be a nazirite, thus violating neither the obligation imposed on him by the Torah nor his vow of naziriteship. But Ha-Levi recognizes that doing so would be a practical impossibility, and on this basis characterizes the vow as a vow of error.'62 In the case of a man who argues that, though he violated the condition triggering the naziriteship, the situa- tion was such that he thought the naziriteship would not apply, Abi Zimra considers it an example of a vow of error.163 De Medina rules similarly in a case in which the vowers were led falsely to believe that they could avoid the condition that would trigger the naziriteship.'64 157.

This act caused great anguish to his widowed mother, who threatened to give all her considerable wealth away, rather than let him inherit a penny of it, if he went through with the match. The man now regretted that he had ever made the vow, and the girl's father had agreed to call the marriage off, but the vow stood in the way. This situation, namely, a regret in hindsight that one had ever made the vow, does not seem to be much different from the classic case for release. But the Samson nazirite vow, of course, is not subject to release. De Medina, however, judges this to be a case of a vow of error, because of the overwhelmingly convincing con- clusion that, had the man been aware of the circumstances which later became evident, he would never have vowed. De Medina draws a distinction between a plausible argument of this type and an overwhelmingly convinc- ing one, relegating the former to the requirement of a formal release, and reserving the latter for the automatic nullification of a vow of error. The dif- ference, he says, is up to the individual judgment of the deciding rabbi.165 3. The Mishnah describes a situation which is clearly an example of a vow of compulsion. It states that one may swear falsely to protect one's property from illegal seizure.166 The "compulsion" here is the danger of great financial loss. The Talmud elsewhere, in Tractate Nazir, makes men- tion of "vows of compulsion," and Pseudo-Rashi, in interpreting that pas- sage, suggests that "compulsion" includes a mistaken presumption; one is "compelled" by the force of one's error.'67 This definition would merge "vows of compulsion" with "vows of error."'68 Only a few responsa utilize the concept of vows of compulsion, but it is interesting to see what kinds of compulsion are envisaged. A father's vow to prohibit to his son any benefit the latter may derive from him unless he undertakes a Samson nazirite vow not to visit his relatives is seen as compul- 165.

Subsequent- ly it became clear that he lacked that ability. The respondent included among the reasons for invalidating the vow the argument that it was a vow of compulsion, based on Pseudo-Rashi in Nazir.'7' There is an astounding responsum exemplifying the contrary attitude toward this issue. In a case which we have seen above, a leading member of a synagogue was intimidated by members of a rival congregation to switch allegiance, and to undertake a Samson nazirite vow that he would not return to his former congregation. They had informed on him to the gentile authorities, and, after he was being sought by them, offered to call them off if he would comply with their request. In spite of the blatant coercion, the respondent refused to invalidate the vow on that basis, ruling that it involved only a potential, not actual, monetary loss.172 XIV We have discussed above the popular conception of the Samson nazirite vow. It was viewed as a mechanism for making a vow irrevocable, and it rarely if ever included the idea of accepting naziriteship in its halakhic sense. It is not surprising, therefore, to find people asserting that they were un- aware of the nature of the Samson naziriteship when they undertook the vow. Evidence of the extent of this assertion, and the role it played in efforts to invalidate the effects of the vow, can be seen in the wording of a formal agreement which specifically precludes just such a subsequent claim."'73 The rabbis differed in their assessments of such an assertion. Abi Zimra dismisses as highly improbable the claim that one was unaware of the impli- 169. Mabit, III, no. 139; cited above, n. 63. 170. Zeqan Aharon, no. 182, cited above, n. 84. 171.

Because of this very stringency people vow by means of it, so that there be no release."'75 To Elijah ha-Levi, on the other hand, it is axiomatic that people are not aware of the restrictions of nazirite- ship, and he views the vow in this circumstance as a vow of error.176 Abi Zimra, on the other hand, is willing to entertain the argument if the vower only mentioned "Samson," without his other appellations."'77 Ibn Lev, approaching the problem in a similar way, regards the phrase "with all its conditions" as tantamount to an admission of one's awareness of those con- ditions.'78 In reality, the phrase "with all its conditions" had become an integral, stereotyped part of the terminology, even appearing as a Hebrew phrase in a Judeo-Spanish context.179 XV One of the most effective resources which the rabbis had at their disposal for invalidating the Samson nazirite vow derived from a rather incidental passage in the Talmud, not connected to the Samson nazirite vow per se, a sort of "back door" approach to the problem. A passage in the Mishnah is emended by the Talmud to read as follows: "He who desires that none of his vows made during the coming year shall be valid, should declare: 'Any vow I will make will be invalid,' providing that he remember it at the time of the vow."'"8 This provides us with a way of automatically nullifying in advance any vows which we may make. In addition, another emandation is suggested in the ensuing discussion, which would emend "providing that he remem- ber" to "providing that he does not remember." This passage came to be of importance in the textual history of the Kol 174. Radbaz, no. 136. 175. Ibid., no. 694. 176. Zeqan Aharon, no. 36; see also Joseph Castro, Oholei Ya'akov, no. 34. 177.

The original version of Kol Nidrei referred to the nullification of past vows incurred during the preceding year. But, in light of the halakhic difficulties of such a formula, it was emended by French scholars in the twelfth century so that it would annul vows in advance for the coming year, on the halakhic authority of the passage cited above. There was current in the sixteenth century, in addition to the original and the emended versions, a version which combined both: "from the last Day of Atonement to this Day of Atonement, and from this Day of Atonement to the next Day of Atone- ment."'8' Most of the evidence from the Samson nazirite responsa indicates ab silentio the original version, which was not seen as having any halakhic validity. In a responsum of Abi Zimra, specific reference is made, by way of exception, to a rabbi who was in the habit of using the combined version. The rabbi had scolded a student for being negligent in his studies, and the student had answered back, "It's not enough that you yourself are negligent and insufficiently prepared, you yet scold me!" The rabbi then took a Sam- son nazirite vow that he would never teach that student again. Subsequent- ly, however, the student reformed his ways and became outstanding in his studies. The rabbi then wanted him back and sought a way out of his vow. Abi Zimra based the invalidation of the vow on the Kol Nidrei text, on con- dition that the rabbi had not been thinking of it when he uttered the vow.'82 The rabbi was an exception, and Kol Nidrei was not helpful for most people. However, there seems to have been a widespread custom, though not universal, of nullifying vows in advance, on the eve (i.e., the day preced- ing) Rosh ha-Shanah. This practice was brought into play by respondents, almost as an afterthought, after having rejected other avenues to a solution, sometimes giving the impression of a deus ex machina.'83 Yom Tov Tsaha- lon, in the generation following the period under review, writes that it was customary for the court to ask those who appeared before it for release from vows, whether they had nullified their vows in advance before Rosh ha- 181.

Nevertheless, a plausible though conjectural reconstruction of the events suggests itself. One can only conjecture as to why the vow appears when it does without any observable antecedents. It makes its debut on the stage of public record, as evidenced by a single genizah fragment, in the fifteenth century in Spain. Its appearance in halakhic literature dates from the early part of the sixteenth century, before 1513, in Egypt, in the case of the nagid, Isaac Shulal. It may be assumed that the Samson nazirite vow was already a well- entrenched feature of daily life when Shulal, in a moment of wrath, swore that he would never appoint so-and-so judge. It was apparently the public nature and political overtones of the case which brought a feature of folk culture into the arena of halakhic discourse. The halakhic discussion of the issue continued throughout the century and beyond, as the practice forced itself on rabbinic attention. In general, rabbinic opinion, while agreed on the desirability of finding a solution to the problem posed by the irrevocability of the Samson nazirite vow, was nevertheless polarized into two opposing attitudes, which became manifest 184.

Perhaps he was referring to the controversy over whether the nullification applied only if the vow-taker did not remember the vow at the time, or only if he did remember it. However, the respondents dis- cussed in this study universally held the former view.

One atti,- tude was open to a halakhic recognition of the true nature of the vow in the, popular mind. It was, after all, merely a form of oath, and the irntention of the vower was centered entirely on the substance of the oath. The notion that one might in fact live the life of a Samson nazirite never entered the mind of the vower. Oaths in general were subject to release, and it was only a technicality which prevented a release in this case. The rabbis who adopted this attitude sought to utilize whatever technicalities they could discover to invalidate the vow. This attitude is first manifest in Jacob Berav's ruling in the original Shulal case, which insists on the specific designation of Samson as, at the very least, "son of Manoah, husband of Delilah." Joseph Taitazak expressed this attitude in the most explicit terms. He would have ruled according to a view in the Talmud which would invalidate all nazirite vows which were conditional. Though Maimonides barred his way to such a rul- ing, he states quite openly that it is proper to seek whatever means are available to rule leniently. Moses Trani is another exponent of this school. Unlike the previous two, Trani left us a rich legacy of responsa on the issue of the Samson nazirite vow. At every point, Trani takes the lenient position. This is so with his insistence on the mention of Samson's designations;'87"' with the invalidation of nazirite vows followed by "that.. ." rather than "if .".;'88 and with the expanded definition of "vows of error."'89 The other attitude insisted on the fiction that the vower had intended to undertake the Samson naziriteship. Though the reality was well understood by this group as well, its spokesmen, though anxious to seek a lenient ruling, were unwilling to jettison accepted halakhic norms. If a man stated that he was a nazirite, then he was a nazirite, regardless of what he may have had in mind. They were not prone to twist reality by insisting, as Berav did, that the statement "I am hereby a nazirite like Samson son of Manoah" might have been in reference to someone else with that name, in spite of the principal's own assertion to the contrary. This attitude is markedly evident in the 187. See above, n. 124. 188. See above, n. 140. Compare, however, Mabit, II, no. 15. 189. See text to n. 157.

In the latter case, the formulation of the vow understandably reflects rabbinic rulings. One is not likely to find a "that I" clause instead of an "if" clause, or the failure to mention Samson's various designations. This is a very different situation from the spontaneous vows which were of daily occurrence. These were probably all in Judeo-Spanish, though they usually appear in the responsa in Hebrew translation. Only in a handful of cases has the Judeo-Spanish text of the vow survived, though the earliest, the genizah fragment, is among them. In the genizah vow Samson's designations are mentioned, "son of Manoah, husband of Delilah." This was apparently not universally the case, as evidenced by the Shulal vow. In any case, rabbinic insistence on their specific mention filtered down to the general public. It is striking to see the corrupted form bar delilah, "son of Delilah," substituted by an ignorant public for ba'al delilah, "husband of Delilah," in a clumsy attempt to accommodate rabbinic rulings.191 In a vow clearly uttered in spontaneous anger, we find the phrase "the naziriteship of Samson son of Manoah, husband of Delilah, with all its conditions" appearing as a Hebrew phrase in an otherwise Judeo-Spanish context.'92 In a responsum from 1600, a woman, intimidated into making a vow imposed on her by her hus- band, incorporated Samson's designations in Judeo-Spanish translation.'- Although a vow is ostensibly a private matter between the individual and his God, the Samson nazirite vow played a social role, and impinged on the welfare of others. It could be fashioned into a powerful weapon by one per- son against another or by a faction against the community. It is understand- 190. See above, nn. 26-29. 191. See above, n. 108.

This assertion was challenged by another faction of signatories. Samuel de Medina, in his discussion, introduces issues regarding the trustworthiness of witnesses which properly belong to the sphere of civil law, not to the reli- gious law of vows.'95 This is a tacit recognition of the social function of the Samson nazirite vow.
