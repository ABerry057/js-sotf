FELDMAN in Israel (viewed by some as "the bad boy of the modern Israeli stage"),' public outrage reached unprecedented heights. The scandal was partially provoked by Levin's staging. His taste for the carnal and the cruel was much too unpalatable for many stomachs to digest. "People actually walked out, while others covered their eyes," reported a review in the Jerusalem Post.2 No less detrimental, however, was the specific angle from which Levin the playwright elected to retell the biblical story. For although the Hebrew title of the play, Yisurei lyov, may be literally rendered as "Job's Afflictions," our translation was advisedly chosen: In his version, Levin catapults Job from the fictional land of Uz to Palestine of the Roman era, thereby embedding Job's ordeal in that later agon between man and God-the passion of Christ. Accordingly, this dramatized Job does not live to hear an answer from the whirlwind, nor does he see his life redeemed. With a dramatic sleight of hand he is, paradoxically enough, the only character in the play who refuses to deny the existence of God-thus condemning himself to the stake. That this splicing together of two disparate stories smacks of the Christian interpretation of Scripture is no doubt true. Yet nothing is further removed from the playwright's heart than the acceptance of figural read- ing.3 On the contrary: Christian materials, to the extent that they are woven into this drama, serve merely as a ploy in Levin's deconstruction of both systems of thought, the "old" and the "new." Inasmuch as both presuppose the autonomous existence of the sacred, they are both alien to Levin's artis- 1. Herbert S. Joseph, Modern Israeli Drama (Rutherford: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1983), p. 12. Curiously, this very recent anthology of Israeli drama, the only one in English translation, does not include any play by the leading Israeli playwrights of the 1960s and 1970s, Nissim Aloni and Hanoch Levin, respectively. While in the case of the former some technical obstacles may be responsible (only a few of Aloni's plays were published), the excuse put forward in the case of the latter is rather elusive. Saying that Levin's "plays are topical and have not as yet lent themselves to adequate translations" (ibid.), Joseph evades the issue rather than confronts it. 2.

The Great Whore of Babylon (1983) and Everyone Wants to Live (1985) may be readily classified as the "theater of cruelty." 3.

In fact, Levin simultaneously dramatizes and undercuts that long-debated theological construct, the "Judeo-Christian tradition."4 His hero is therefore not a Christ figure, just as he is not a true Job figure. This is a modern antihero, whose pathetic search for a "father" ends with a grotesque parody of Jesus' famous last words (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). When Levin's impaled Job pleads with his friends, "I am afraid! Don't leave me alone with God,"5 the irony is inescapable. Rather than lamenting his exile from the divine ("O God, O God, Why have thou forsaken me?"), this modern Job is afraid of God's presence. As we shall see, God the Father is totally displaced here, not by the God of Vengeance, but by a radical negation, namely, His total absence. There is nothing new, of course, in the portrayal of modern man as a creature divorced from any contact with the divine. The European Theater of the Absurd has depicted over and over again the "splendid isolation" of modernity, the reduction of human being to the mere basics of existence, his alienation from the world and from his own inner core, and above all- man's awareness of his own finality. What therefore seems unusual about Levin's play is not its "existential" message ("What is a man?... / Is he the last scream on his deathbed / or his first scream between the legs of his mother? / Is he all the horrible and absurd mess / between these two screams?" [p. 38]), but rather the fact that the playwright found no better way to express this truth than via the deconstruction of two of the most universally venerated "myths" of Western culture. Indeed, it is this unexpected marriage between the absurd and the sacred that had such a powerful impact on some theatergoers-and was so loath- some to others. As in many a controversy of this sort, a close scrutiny of the play may uncover supporting evidence for either of these emotional posi- tions. However, that is not the intention of the present essay. Our purpose is rather to illuminate the contextual significance of this play, namely, the way in which it has transformed two traditions-the European Theater of the Absurd and the Israeli biblical drama. What these two traditions have in common-all obvious disparities notwithstanding-is precisely their 4. And see on this point Arthur A.

FELDMAN strained attitude to matters of the sacred. The problematics are different in each case. They nevertheless do converge in the work of this Israeli play- wright who is responsible for implanting his version of the absurd into the heart of the Israeli theater. The Passion of Job will be therefore discussed as a contemporary response, both Israeli and universal, to the pressures of modern, post-Holocaust sensibility in its simultaneous search for and denial of the sacred. When Martin Esslin's book The Theatre of the Absurd was published in 1961, it for the first time defined a phenomenon that had occupied center stage in Europe for a decade and a half.6 Yet Esslin has convincingly shown that in a less concentrated way this "new" theater had roots going back almost to the beginning of the dramatic tradition, particularly in its popular varieties (nonverbal entertainment, verbal nonsense, fantastic-allegorical drama, the music hall). His claim for the tradition of the absurd (chap. 6) gains momentum, however, when he reaches the turn of the century. At that time an abundance of revisionist "isms" had made for a string of literary/ artistic movements, all of which seemed to exhibit one or another feature later utilized by the dramatists of the absurd. Esslin's ability to pinpoint the antecedents of Beckett, Ionesco, or Genet in the work of Joyce, Kafka, and (more obviously) the dadaists, surrealists, expressionists, and existentialists, is impressive in its sweeping scope. But most daring is his attempt to formu- late the significance of the absurd (chap. 7); to give "meaning" to a form of art notorious for its seeming "meaninglessness"; to define in a discursive, logical language the most antiverbal and "nonsensical" theater that ever existed. Not surprisingly, Esslin begins this attempt with a reference to Nietzsche's Zarathustra, or more specifically, to Zarathustra's wonderment at the old saint in the forest who "has not yet heard that God is dead." Against this backdrop, claims Esslin, "the Theatre of the Absurd, by a strange paradox, is also a symptom of what probably comes nearest to being a genuine religious quest in our age" (p. 351). It attempts to make man aware of the ultimate realities of his condition, by stripping him of the "acci- 6. Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1961).

This feature of the human condition is most forcefully confronted by Beckett, whose characters are literally stripped of any social context. More than anything else, Beck- ett's plays (Waiting for Godot, 1952; Endgame, 1957; Krapp's Last Tape, 1959) dramatize the existentialist notion of "thrownness," namely, man's contingency in the world. That such a "stripping" or reduction actually results in a theater that is "grotesque, frivolous, and irreverent" (p. 353) is only too clear, which, of course, compounds the inherent paradox. For Esslin does not hesitate to argue that despite its irreverentform, this theater represents "a return to the original, religious function of the theatre-the confrontation of man with the spheres of myth and religious reality" (p. 353). Aware of the naivety of such a "return," he nevertheless unobstru- sively adds: "The difference is merely that ... the Theatre of the Absurd expresses the absence . . . of values" (ibid.; emphasis added). One may doubt, I believe, the applicability of the qualifier "merely" to such an awesome reversal from "presence" to "absence." And nothing proves this more poignantly than Esslin's own concluding passages. In sup- port of his claim that the "the theatre ... in many ways assumed the func- tion of a substitute church" (p. 373), he turns not to the normative Judeo- Christian tradition of what Derrida would soon label "the metaphysics of Presence,"7 but rather to the tradition of the "mystical experience" (p. 375), wherein the sense of "the ineffability, the emptiness, the nothingness" (in other words-of "absence") constitutes the core of human experience of the world. Although this basic intuition has been shared by mystical trends of all denominations, it is Eastern rather than Western mysticism that serves here as a major model. It is no accident that "Ionesco has been quoted as drawing a parallel between the method of the Zen Buddhists and the Theatre of the Absurd" (p. 376). Esslin eagerly approves of this proposition: "The recent rise of interest in Zen in Western countries is an expression of the same tendencies that explain the success of the Theatre of the Absurd-a preoccupation with ultimate realities and a recognition that they are not approachable through conceptual thought alone" (ibid.). Furthermore, he 7. Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 179 et passim.</page><page sequence="6">256 YAEL S. FELDMAN argues, this common motivation is expressed in similar forms-body lan- guage, verbal nonsense, poetic image; and "both these attitudes are in basic contradiction to systems of thought, religious or ideological (e.g. Marxism), that claim to provide complete answers to all questions of ultimate purpose and day-to-day conduct" (p. 377). The parenthetic reference to Marxism may well function as an "inter- preting sign." It directs the contemporary reader's attention to a major rift that divided European theater after World War II-the divergence between lonesco's introspective "pure" theater and Brecht's didactic "epic" theater.8 Put differently, Esslin points here to the philosophical opposition between the religious "metaphysics of absence" shared by the mystics and the drama- tists of the absurd, on one hand, and the ideological-Marxist system of thought embodied in Brechtian epic theater, on the other. Elsewhere, he mentions other, more literary ramifications of this opposition, but he fails to pursue their significance. As is well known, Beckett's emphasis on "the inadequacy of language" (the title of Niklaus Gessner's thesis on Beckett),9 and the liquidation of "plot" and "characters" (i.e., psychological motiva- tion) actually meant an assault on storytelling itself, namely, the "killing" of dramatic dialogue.'0 Just as significant, however, yet scarcely observed, was lonesco's thematic obliteration of any recognizable traces of mythic ele- ments. No wonder Ionesco was the champion of Zen Buddhism among the dramatists of the absurd. In his work (e.g., The Bald Soprano, 1950; The Lesson, 1951; The Chairs, 1952), the avoidance of the wide body of mytho- logy that has nourished Western culture throughout history is most obvious. Any literary or mythical archetype drawn from the Greek or Judeo- Christian tradition would come readymade with its own "story" and with its "presence" or "fullness" of meanings, echoes, and reverberations. And this he wanted to avoid at all costs. In his aspiration to invent "a new language" lonesco was more radical than most innovators before him. He was not con- 8.

His attempt at a clear break with the past took the form of a complete "denial." Rather than struggle with the myths saturating the main- stream of Western culture, he ignored them altogether. If Tynan was right in arguing that lonesco's "anti-theatre" was moving away from "characters and events [that] have traceable roots in life" (Esslin, pp. 100-101), one may add that it was also moving away from characters and events (stories) tradi- tionally associated with Judeo-Christian lore, myth, and ritual. It was easier, it seems, to create a new myth "modelled after an English primer" (Esslin, pp. 109-110) than to challenge the "sacred" from within." Athough in no other dramatist was this tendency as extreme, it is nevertheless clear that the theater of the absurd as a whole shared this pre- disposition. It was not only life per se (experienced as a psychological, social, or historical entity) that was ostensibly banished from its stage; the rich welter of tradition, the mythic infrastructure of Western culture, did not fare much better. It is for this reason that Esslin had to make such a strong case when claiming for the theater of the absurd the status of a "substitute church" or the function of a religious myth. Quite simply put, mythic content, to the extent that it exists there, is highly elusive, or heavily distorted.'2 The short history of the contemporary Hebrew theater reveals quite a different attitude toward mythical materials and "sacred" sources. From the beginning of the modern era the Bible has held a great attraction for Hebrew dramatists, as it has for Hebrew writers in general. In the Bible's "sacred history," they found a convenient vehicle for the dramatic metaphorization of a secular renaissance. Just at the time when Western culture was "turning away from ... the idols of the tribe,"'3 Hebrew literature was being reborn 11. The most palpable illustration of this new "myth" is lonesco's first play, The Bald Soprano. The grotesque, loosely connected dialogue of this play often resembles the inane drills of an English primer ("How Curious!" "This is a floor!" "This is a ceiling!"). Its absurdist charm continues to draw audiences in Paris until this day, as did its recent off-Broadway revival in New York. 12.

FELDMAN as the expression of a newly defined national identity. It was therefore only natural for the first Hebrew theater, Habima (established in Moscow in 1918), to seek out biblical plays as part of its attempt to create the first modern Hebrew repertory. Thus, while its opening plays, The Wandering Jew (1919) and The Dybbuk (1922), typically dramatized postbiblical themes (exilic messianism and mysticism), its later recourse to biblical dramas was no doubt an endeavor to highlight its national, pre-exilic identification, which was Hebraic in both language and ideology.'4 Paradoxically, a noticeable change took place in the years following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. In a recent study of the history of the Habima, Emanuel Levi points out that "from 1949 to 1968 the Habima produced six biblical plays, only one of which was strictly a biblical play."'" Since the "strictly biblical" play was written by the German-Jewish writer Max Zweig, we may conclude that none of the Israeli plays referred to was "biblical." What were they, then? With one exception (to which we will shortly return), most of them were thinly disguised allegories about the con- temporary scene (Israeli as well as universal) that had little or no success on the stage.'6 Trying to account for this decrease in the number of biblical plays produced by Habima, Levi reminds us that, "The Habima has been founded as an ideologically oriented theatre, a theatre of 'prophetic pathos' and 'sacred attitude,' to use Bialik's words" (p. 281, emphasis added). By the sixties, he explains, the inheritance of this highly charged "prophetic mission" had been spent. Israel was increasingly becoming a secularized society, losing its "sacred" attitude toward its own nationhood, with all the cultural trimmings. This assessment is no doubt true, yet it may be too careless in its use of language. The term "secularization" is altogether a misnomer here, since Habima never embodied any religious fervor in the literal sense. Bialik's diction was perforce poetic and metaphoric. By the time Habima was estab- lished, "sacredness" and "prophecy" had long lost their literal meaning and 14.

These plays were: Aharon Megged's High Season (see n. 32) and Genesis (1962; see n. 22); A Journey to Nineveh by the poet Yehuda Amichai (1964); and Samson by writer Yigal Mosinsohn (1969).

The challenge that Habima later failed to meet was therefore not the maintaining of an ostensible "sacredness," but rather the adjustment to the split between "Jewish" and "Hebrew" that was taking root in the early years of the young state. In the new Israeli semantics, the compatibility between "Jewish" and "Hebrew" was no longer taken for granted. In the tradition of Nietzsche's "transvaluation of values," propagated in Hebrew literature since the turn of the century (by M. J. Berdichewsky and his fol- lowers), "Jewish" now came to be a negatively marked term. It stood for diaspora culture, mostly of European provenance, the immediate past rejected by the founding fathers. "Hebrew," on the other hand, stood for the ancient past-the one embodied in the biblical texts-as well as for the enterprise of restoration taking place in Israel. The fact remains, however, that within this dichotomy the Bible held a symbolically ambiguous posi- tion. Although Labor Zionism was quite successful in historicizing the sacred sources, making them a "Hebrew"/Israeli/Socialist Zionist text, it could not totally expunge them of their "Jewish" overtones, of everything that had been held sacred for two thousand years. For the champions of Hebrew (non-Jewish) Israeli culture, the Bible has therefore become a source of unresolved tension, as it would not allow for neat categorizations: It was both Hebraic and Jewish, national and religious, secular and sacred, a pre-exilic as well as a diaspora product. (Most pertinent in this connection, and overwhelmingly prophetic, is Gershom Scholem's anxious insight, sug- gested as early as 1926 in a letter to Franz Rosenzweig: "If we transmit to our children the language that has been transmitted to us, if we, the transi- tional generation, bring the language of the ancient books to life in them in such a way that it may disclose itself anew to them-then one day must not the religious force of this language break out [ausbrechen] against its speakers?" [December 26, 1926].) One could argue, then, that the decline in the production of biblical drama in the Israeli theater (not only in Habima!) was a symptom of a major collective dilemma-Israel's precarious self-definition. Its ambivalence towards its "sacred" history was no doubt related to its inability to mesh together the Hebrew/Jewish facets of its split identity.'7 In fact, it was pre- 17. This issue has not lost its relevance to this day, except that now the term "Israeli" replaces the old "Hebrew." However, while earlier Zionism was defining itself vis-g-vis Jewish diaspora culture, today it is beseiged, in addition, by Arab Israeli culture (in Hebrew!). And see</page><page sequence="10">260 YAEL S. FELDMAN cisely Habima's greatest dramatic achievement of the early fifties, Nissim Aloni's Most Cruel of All Is the King (the exception to the rule mentioned above),'8 that in the guise of a play about the division of Solomon's king- dom (I Kings 12-13) dramatized the contemporary cultural movement known as the "Young Hebrews" or "Canaanites." The extreme ideology of this group called for a break with "diaspora Jewishness," a return to biblical or even prebiblical mythology, and cultural and political integration within the Middle East.'9 Yet by the end of the fifties, this deep-seated need for autonomous cultural self-definition, markedly separate from the immediate European past, clearly clashed with the growing sense of guilt evoked by the Holocaust. The result of this unresolved conflict was, predictably enough, a kind of i compromise formation. Recognizing the untenability of a narrow :"Hebrew" self-definition, but unable to embrace anew their "Jewish" iden- tity, Israelis tried to escape into universal realms, where the choice could be avoided. Throughout the sixties this "universalism" pervaded all areas of culture, even literary research.20 This was the decade in which Israeli drama began to imitate the theater of the absurd and other foreign models, for it had to compete with the imported avant-garde theater that was by then occupying center stage.2' Under these circumstances biblical drama barely survived in two forms: the heavy-handed allegory and the comical farce. In both cases the Bible was used as a source for universal themes (Genesis the public debate between A. B. Yehoshua and the Arab Hebrew writer Amton Shamas. The most recent installment of this debate was delivered by Yehoshua in.a colloquium on "Cultural and Religious Pluralism," held at the Spinoza Institute in Jerusalem, it was published in Yediot Aharonot as "I am an Israeli!" 18.

Israeli drama was taken over by two trends: the ideological-realistic play, per- formed mainly (but not only) by the relatively young Haifa Municipal Theater, and led by Yehoshua Sobol;23 and the Israeli variety of the theater of the absurd, single-handedly written and directed by Hanoch Levin, and recently mounted by the Tel Aviv Cameri Theater. Less central, but highly relevant to our argument was the endeavor, carried out in Jerusalem in the early eighties, to create a "Jewish theater." Under the leadership of director Yossi Yizraeli, a group of young playwrights tried to redress the imbalance caused by both the ultra-Orthodox and the "non-Jewish" "Israelis." Yet despite some highly successful productions (reworkings of such Jewish masters-both Hebrew and Yiddish-as Agnon and Sholem Aleichem), the Jewish theater seems (so far) to have fared not much better than biblical drama. Currently, its impetus appears to have spent itself, while some of the plays written for it are presently being considered by the Mosaic-the new Jewish theater of the 92nd Street Y in New York. Viewed against this backdrop, The Passion of Job assumes specific signi- ficance. By overtly subjecting the myths of Job/Jesus to the reductionist "stripping" of the absurd, Hanoch Levin moved beyond both the tradition of Hebrew biblical drama and his own Ionesco-style drama, created throughout the seventies on the Israeli stage; at the same time he was also challenging the very concept of the "significance" of the absurd as be- labored by Esslin. 22.

FELDMAN After a brief but stormy apprenticeship in the political revue,24 Levin conditioned his audiences to expect a merciless debunking of the middle- class Everyman. "His plays," says critic Gershon Shaked (1974), "expose the Tel Aviv bourgeoisie of the seventies and the sufferings of the oppressed and depressed. .. . His protagonists are the small victims of the small smug Israeli middle-class society, but they reflect the violence, disillusion and narrow-mindedness of the whole world.... Human existence becomes a terrible distortion and the grotesque dominates the stage."'25 The major device by which Levin achieves the dramatization of the grotesque is the reduction of his characters to a minimal matrix of existence. In his first successful show, the potential range of this matrix was symbo- lized by the title, Hefetz, which was also the name of the protagonist.26 Signi- ficantly, this Hebrew word connotes the contradictory meanings of the nouns "will" and "object." The action of the play consists, in fact, of the uneven play between these two connotations. The protagonist's paltry self- will gives way in the end to that of his "relatives." His final leap from the balcony (ceremonially planned for "6 p.m." and prepared as a conventional party with all the trimmings-invitations, refreshments, catering) is the cynical victory of the others' image of Hefetz as "an object to be discarded" over his own tenuously human self-image. The resolution of the play does not leave any room, then, for the ambiguity initially implied by the title. Nevertheless, this ambiguity does serve as the starting point for the dramatic conflict, thereby extending the range of its existential matrix. Similar structures underline Levin's succeeding plays; yet the positive, human component of their ostensible conflicts grows noticeably fainter. The action of the later plays resembles more and more Beckett's circular non- plots; and their protagonists move ever closer to Ionesco's puppetlike dramatis personae.27 As observed by drama critic Gideon Ofrat, Levin aptly 24. Levin's earliest plays were provocative satires, responding to the political aftermath of the Six-Day War (1967): You, Me, and the Next War; Ketchup; The Bathtub Queen. They are now collected in his recently published book, Ma 'ikhpat lazipor (Hakkibutz Hameuchad and Mo'adon Hasefer, 1987). 25.

While Ionesco had dramatized symbolically the reifica- tion and bestialization of mankind (The Chairs, 1952; Rhinoceros, 1959), Levin stripped his protagonists of all the trappings of civilization by immers- ing them in their animal instincts. In a way, his characters evolve into the dramatic embodiment of an arrested psychological development. And it is precisely this anal-sadistic fixation that many find objectionable. In the titles of his later plays nothing is left of the ambiguity connoted by Hefetz (1972). The unequivocally scatological meaning of Shits (1975) has not escaped the Israeli audience (despite the semantic opaqueness of the Hebrew "name"); nor has the choice of a public latrine as the locale of an execution in his play by that name (1979).29 Still, nothing in these plays had prepared the Israeli theatergoer for the direct assault Levin undertook in his fifteenth play, The Passion of Job. His reductionist and sarcastic vision had at least partially been tolerated as long as he followed the example of the European theater of the absurd, and shied away from tampering with the great Judeo-Christian myths.30 But now he had turned around and confronted tradition head-on.

In his essay "Hanoch Levin's Rites of Beelzebub" [Hebrew] (Proza, January-March 1981, pp. 79-81), Gideon Ofrat argues that An Execution is Levin's parodic-sadistic version of a medieval morality play, interpreted by him as a sacrificial rite to the Canaanite god Beelze- bub. Ofrat may be right, but one must remember that in this case the Christian and pagan myths function as a latent subtext. The textual clues for the mythical deep structure are sparse and in no way approach the blatant use of myth in The Passion of Job.</page><page sequence="14">264 YAEL S. FELDMAN preoccupations were greatly muted on this occasion (he made up for it, however, in the plays that followed, see note 2). But whatever was left of his anal-aggressive code was more than enough to upset the unsuspecting audience. In the critical reception of the play one senses, more than ever before, a difficulty in accepting the application of "Levin's old ways" to "subject-matter of such magnitude." Symptomatic of this sentiment- which is neither prudish nor unappreciative of Levin's theatrical prowess- is the statement that "now nobody will touch this wonderful subject again for the next fifty years."3' The key term in this formulation is the word "again." For it raises a curious question: How many "Jobs" have there been on the Israeli stage? The answer is none; or almost none.32 But why should this be so? After all, the Book of Job has hardly any relevance to the issues of the national past. In its ahistoricity and universal- ism it should have been an ideal escape from the Israeli identity conflict outlined above. Yet this did not happen, and for reasons that seem to be, at least at first sight, aesthetic rather than ideological. For almost a century now critics have argued over the reasons for the denigration of the theater in the Hebraic tradition and the ostensible lack of dramatic talent among Jewish writers. This issue was taken up as early as 1868 by the Hebrew critic A. Paperna.33 Its classic formulation belongs, however, to Martin Buber. In a talk he gave in honor of Habima (1935), Buber explained that the lack of original talent for drama derives from the spirit of monotheism, which is antagonistic to the dualism and objectivism necessary for dramatic presentation.34 Significantly, the latest link in this 31.

The one exception, Aharon Megged's High Season (1967), only confirms the general rule: "The play begins where the biblical story ends," says Chaim Shoham, in his study Chal- lenge and Reality in Israeli Drama (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University, 1975), p. 139. Megged does not engage in the ideational or dramatic potentials of the Book of Job, but composes an allegorical postscript, an additional act that reflects the topical issues of the sixties: "the ques- tion of our relationship with Germany, iur right to demand justice after receiving reparations, and the problems of the Jewish return to Germany of a minority that refuses to learn the lessons of the past" (ibid.; my translation).

The following are excerpts from this issue (my translation):</page><page sequence="15">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 265 debate centered around the Book of Job. Following Hegel's definition of the "tragic" and informed by contemporary lamentations over the "death of tragedy" (G. Steiner [1961], and similarly, K. Jaspers, G. Lukacs, W. F. Otto), the literary critic Baruch Kurzweil (1907-1970) argued that the story of Job, and by implication, all other biblical stories and characters, are anti- tragic.35 Like the Christian morality play, claims Kurzweil, the Bible knows only one victorious authority. As such, it lacks the relativity of values which is presupposed by Aristotelian tragedy. The tragic is the domain of equal human forces, not the uneven confrontation between an a priori "just" absolute and a feeble human being. This is why the Book of Job as a whole is not a tragedy, nor could it be. For the worldview of tragic drama stands in contradiction to Judeo-Christian monotheism. Any modern attempt to interpret the Bible as a tragedy, says Kurzweil, presupposes the "desecra- tion" of the ancient text (p. 19). Consequently, "biblical tragedy" is a con- tradiction in terms; it does injustice to its source by misrepresenting its authentic worldview. This brief summary should make it adequately clear that despite the "generic" frame of reference, Kurzweil's interest did not lie with the aesthe- tic issue per se. His treatise on Job reflected his lifelong struggle over the Jewish identity of Israeli society. When we remember, furthermore, that the few biblical plays produced in Israel throughout the sixties were mostly on the comic side, his intention becomes clear: the discussion of the "tragic" was only another step in his relentless critique of the "desecration" of Hebrew letters.36 We clearly have an original talent for the theater .... But just as clearly we lack an origin- al talent for drama. Some would attribute this lack to our indisposition for objectiviza- tion. ... For us there is always someone who is right and someone who is not. In the drama, however, there is no "right" and "wrong"; one feels this way and the other feels that way; one wants this and the other wants that; this speaks in the name of one essential law, and another in the name of an opposing essential law.... The drawback I have mentioned, our indisposition for objectivization, stems from our greatest possession: our knowledge that the opposition of forces and categories in the universe cannot reach the supreme sphere, and that there is one absolutely just being; that there is someone who is absolutely right .. . God is absolutely right. 35.

In the latter's Dimensions of Job, Job is first and</page><page sequence="16">266 YAEL S. FELDMAN It is still too early to gauge the impact Kurzweil's teachings have had on Israeli culture in general.37 What is clear, however, is that in this late and not very original essay he merely expressed explicitly what was felt and tacitly carried out even by the most "nihilist" of writers: Israeli dramatists, in their most "sacrilegious" moments, turned to Judaism's prodigal sons (Jesus, Shabbati Zvi), not to its "elect" ones. Whether this was done out of protest or out of respect is a question we cannot explore here. Nor can we trace the fine line leading from some of these early absurd dramas (e.g., Amos Keinan's Friends Talking About Jesus, 1956) to Hanoch Levin's recent play. In what follows we merely illustrate the ways in which Levin, the drama- tist of the absurd, met the challenge of biblical drama. For this purpose he has used, we argue, a composite technique in which "the tragic" is evoked only to be unmasked. Paradoxically, it is via the tragic that Levin decon- structs the sacred, recasting it as an absurd, inhuman drama. And it is this double reduction (sacred-. tragic-. absurd) that suggests, we claim, a post-Holocaust context. Such a context may account for the total negation of both theodicy and aesthetics carried out in this biblical drama of the absurd. In the first half of the play (five out of the eight "chapters"), Levin fol- lows more or less faithfully the "main plot" of the biblical story. The only change he introduces is in the proportion between the "bad tidings" scenes and the confrontation with the three friends. The Bible's six verses of bad tidings (Job 1:14-20), to which Job does not utter as much as a word, are dramatized here in three detailed scenes ("chapters" 2-4), while the long exchanges between Job and his visitors are condensed into one, relatively long, scene. This slight change in emphasis serves Levin in attaining his main purpose-the undercutting of the metaphysics, ethics, and psychology presupposed by Scripture, while using the biblical story as the mythical scaf- folding of his own drama. In contrast to the initial reticence of the biblical Job, Levin's Job accompanies every step of the accumulating disasters with a vehement expression of outrage and pain. This builds up a character very foremost a rebellious individual, a daring challenger of authority and accepted dogma, not a resigned man of faith. 37. See a recent study in English: James S. Diamond, Barukh Kurzweil and Modern Hebrew Literature (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1982).</page><page sequence="17">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 267 different from the Bible's righteous saint. It seems that the playwright is out to create a humanly "flawed" dramatic persona, almost an Aristotelian tragic hero. This impression is further reinforced by another deviation from the original plot: Unlike the biblical Job, whose closest contact with the possibility of sin was via the feasting of his sons (Job 1:4-5), here it is Job himself who is engaged in gluttonous feasting. Clearly, the main character is removed from his status as an innocent pharmakos (the scapegoat of tragic irony, according to Northrop Frye's classification)," and is presumably set on the plane of classical tragedy-lifted above the average man, but human enough to err. The significance of these modifications extends beyond details of plot and characterization; they actually transform the philosophic point of departure of the argument. A universe populated by morally weak human beings (rather than by righteous saints or even innocent victims) is a place where evil and misfortune are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. As a matter of fact, Levin's "humanized" perception of evil hits the spectator at the very opening of the play: The curtain goes up not on the famous prologue in heaven, but on a feast hosted by Job. By this omission, the playwright stakes out the moral and philosophical territory of his play. He in fact hands out the "semiotic" clue to his version of the story. The discarding of the con- frontation between God and his Adversary as the "rationale" for man's plight foreshadows not only the retreat of the Divine from the unfolding of this human drama, but also, and perhaps more so, the "banality of evil," to use Hannah Arendt's formulation. Levin has no need for a demonic or demiurgic presence, since he finds evil within the human sphere. In stark contrast to the Western "romantic" tradition of fascination with the figure of Satan (Milton, Goethe), Levin altogether ignores him. By so doing, he seems to be taking just the right step toward turning the biblical morality drama into a tragedy, "correcting," so to speak, the "shortcomings" of bib- lical tragedy as viewed by Kurzweil. Disengaged from its transcendental framing narrative, the plot loses its Archimedean hold on the absolute, and ostensibly falls prey to the fateful struggle between equally "justifiable" claims. 38.

FELDMAN Yet this is not the case. Nothing could be further removed from Levin's artistic intention than a tragic interpretation of Scripture. On the con- trary: It was precisely the "modern tradition" of psychological-tragic read- ing of biblical characters that had been earlier tried on the Israeli stage. By the time Levin started writing for the theater this technique had already been exhausted, leaving room only for farcical-parodic interpretations. So Levin was not interested in creating a fallen tragic hero with whom the spectator is invited to identify. Despite his tragic potentials, Levin's Job is almost a marionette; and although he does not wear a mask, Brechtian style, the audience remains at a great remove from his "passion." This alienating effect is achieved by means of a powerful weaving together of linguistic signs. The language with which Levin equips his characters is a unique amalgam of allusions, some of them barely translatable. This allusive tex- ture, more than any other single dramatic element, serves Levin in decon- structing his sources while reconstructing the myth itself. Several codes are introduced by the allusive system, all of them placing "tragedy" within a parodic, absurdist context. Thus, for example, the philosophico-ethical issue framing the play is the question "What is Man?" The final absurdist answer is given at the end of the play by a "pathetic clown" who serves as a kind of chorus (quoted at the opening of our essay, above). Yet before this anagnorisis is reached, Job's moral depravity is demonstrated by a grotesque distortion of this very ques- tion. His opening monologue addresses itself to the theme "What is a sated man?", thereby reducing human existence to a digestive tract. The absurdist perspective is dramatically illustrated by the gruesome procession of crippled beggars (one more decrepit than the other), who feed on the meager remains left over by the utterly stuffed ("sated") guests. Furthermore, the "prologue" ends on a parodic allusion to both Job 1:21 and the New Testa- ment's miracle of the loaves and fishes: What have we seen? A miracle? Or a natural phenomenon? A chicken bone fed a dozen... Two things we have seen, that much is clear. First, there is a God; Secondly, God gives... With this, the composite technique of the play is fully presented. The "sacred" is replaced by the potentially "tragic," only to be cruelly undercut</page><page sequence="19">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 269 by the portrayal of humanity at its lowest. The exposition implies, then, a debunking of the very notions of both the sacred and the tragic. This, however, will be fully developed only in the second part of the play, where Levin leaves behind the original plot and has a passing circus "purchase" his impaled Job as a "spectacular" attraction. Another thematic code touched by the end of the prologue is the age-old argument concerning the existence of God. This is, of course, directly relat- ed to the theodicy issue which lies at the core of the Book of Job. Levin, however, places it in a contemporary context. Through a subtle transcod- ing, he alludes to the post-Holocaust polemics over the death of God, the banality of evil, and the possibilities of the tragic."39 With chilling sarcasm, Job reminds the "collectors" who come to confiscate all he owns that they have forgotten to remove the gold caps from his teeth (p. 10). Their answer is just as revealing: Don't be ridiculous. We are not in the theater and you are not a dramatic protagonist. Don't try to make us into monsters. We are only human beings, we all go home, back to the wife, our slippers, and a warm bowl of soup. The association with Nazi self-righteous apologetics is inescapable. The irony, however, is double-edged. It deconstructs the biblical perception of evil, on which the mythical frame of Job's story relies, and it denies the applicability of the dramatic concept of the "tragic" to real-life tragedy. One immediate result of passages like this one is the distancing of the spectator from the "passion" presented on the stage. A similar effect is achieved by many parodic allusions that range from Moliere's Arpagon ("But I did love my assets, oh, my possessions, oh, my money, oh, my small mine in Lebanon, my small ships tossing in Alexandria, my small lot of land in Jaffa," p. 15), through a number of contemporary idioms of "popular wisdom" concerning misfortune ("What always happens to others / is hap- pening now to me," p. 5; "What am I? An actor in a bad farce? A blind actor in someone else's joke? This is my life, mine!" p. 6), to a colloquial "con- cretization" of Job 30:1, based on Israeli slang ("You are yourself a dog. / A dog has made you. / Your father is a dog. / Your mother is a bitch," p. 9). 39. See in particular Richard L. Rubenstein, After Auschwitz: Radical Theology and Con- temporary Judaism (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1966). More about this below.</page><page sequence="20">270 YAEL S. FELDMAN This technique comes to a head when Job's famous "blessing" of God (1:21) is represented here by an existentialist statement based on an allusion to Chaim Guri's well-known "herioc" poem associated with the 1948 War of Independence: Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and she had come out naked from her mother's womb, and we all came out one from the other, shivering, in a long, naked line. (p. 11)40 Against this backdrop, Job's heated argument with his "friends" assumes clearly parodic proportions. Again Levin's linguistic talent is instrumental in building up the grotesque. He juxtaposes the friends' heavy- weight, almost scriptural style of argument with Job's colloquial free speech, tinged with allusions to Jesus' style ("And I am telling you .. ."). While the friends argue for the existence of God from transcendental, social, and emotional perspectives (God as the unfathomed creator, as the guarantor of economic order and as a paternal benefactor), Job demands the proof for "anthropodicy" (the theodicy of humanity) (p. 18). Reducing human exis- tence to the unbearable itch with which he is afflicted ("Only the itch separ- ates between man and happiness," p. 16), he claims: "Is this divine justice? No, my friends, a world in which Job exists, does not contain a God!" (ibid.; and cf. Amichai's verse in our epigraph). And further: Let the stars acknowledge the existence of God! Let those whose concepts of good and evil fall into place acknowledge Him! Anyone who feels God's arms hugging him-let him embrace God! (p. 18) The inevitable conclusion is the one familiar from a whole literature of the absurd: And I am telling you: There is no sense in our suffering! It is only suffering... Suffering exists! I exist! You exist! 40. Cf. Chaim Guri's "Look, our bodies are lying here in a long, stretched line..." (ca. 1948).</page><page sequence="21">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 271 The difference between us exists! God does not exist! The itch on my skin exists! My son's death exists! (p. 20) If this indictment sounds as a high point from which there is no return, the playwright has indeed succeeded in fooling us. For just as Job reaches this most extreme position (impersonating a dog, crouched on all fours and "barking," "There is no God!"), Levin produces a soothing compromise, the paternal image of the God of mercy. The third friend, Zofar, brings to its fullest development one of the central codes of the play, the theme of "fatherhood," that was introduced earlier, in Job's lament over his children. The potential lyricism of this scene is nevertheless immediately checked. Job's reconciliation, rooted in the most basic emotional ties of infancy, is garbed in the trite rhythm and imagery of a lullaby. This "lullaby," further- more, consists of elements from three major religions: excerpts of Jewish prayer, allusions to Christian resurrection, and-as if paying homage to Ionesco-the clearly recognizable Zen-Buddhist image of Maya. You dreamt a dream, I told you, the world is a bubbling dream ... Father is alive, father is not dead, from his deathbed my father arises, this is how my sons and daughters will rise, because the world is a dream, only a bubbling dream, and death, like snow, melts in the heat... (p. 23) The non-sequitur logic speaks loudly. Yet it is precisely this irrational hope for a mystical communion with God (the Zen-Buddhist allusion included) that is rootlessly destroyed by the last part of the action. With a quick sleight of hand Levin reverses the basic structure of the dramatic argument. The biblical Voice from the Whirlwind is replaced by the Roman Caesar's decree ("The Jewish God is nullified and naught," p. 25). With this, the whole debate is turned on its head. When the abstract philosophical issue is transformed into a life-threatening existential dilem- ma, all three friends relinquish their former positions. Their excuses may remind one of Voltaire's cynical remark that Satan was mistaken in his scheme against Job, for in the state of poverty and illness men always have recourse to divinity; "they are prosperous people who forget God."4' The 41. Quoted by Glatzer, Dimensions of Job, p. 36.</page><page sequence="22">272 YAEL S. FELDMAN only one who has nothing to lose now, therefore nothing to fear, is poor Job. His is the alienating long-shot perspective so typical of the representation of human suffering in the theater of the absurd. Do you know that from above, from God's bosom, a crying man looks as if he is sneezing? That shrouds -look like kerchiefs? That sorrow, joy-all movements look the same, rather ludicrous? From above, my friends, everything is entertaining. (p. 30) "God's bosom" is interpreted here, then, as the paradigmatic absurd angle from which dramatists have portrayed the motions (rather than the emotions) of the humdrum of this world. The Zen-Buddhist dream is por- trayed as Job's protective defense against "yesterday's pain and suffering" (p. 29), to which he refuses to return. Zofar's attempts to save him, by claim- ing him "irresponsible for his deeds" due to his catastrophe, and by trying, as a mock-Judas, to "buy" him for "only" fifty dinars, also fail. Insanity is not an excuse, says the officer, because one madman in a nearby village, claiming to be the son of God, already has twelve apostles. So what? Are they insane too? Is the army going to sit on its butt and let the whole world go free under the pretense that it is an asylum? (p. 29) Thus Job is turned into a mock-Jesus, sanctifying the name of God while being impaled on an iron stake. It is in this scene that Levin's old anal, sado-masochistic tendencies take over. The crucifixion is grossly parodied, with Job/Jesus sold to the circus, and the stake interpreted as a phallic sym- bol by a masturbating striptease girl. More importantly, Levin has Job and Jesus actually meet on the stage, each of them mistakenly deeming to find his "father" in the other.42 This is where Jesus' famous words are para- phrased in Job's anguished request to his friends "not to leave him alone with God" (p. 37). For Levin would not let Job perish as a martyr. In a paradoxical reversal, Job will not die "a man of principles" (ibid.). Under 42. Ironically, this scene was removed from the stage production a short time after its premiere in Israel.</page><page sequence="23">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 273 the pressure of sheer physical pain, of his last-minute struggle for air, he loses his hold on the whole argument: Air! Ifyou want- there is God! There is no God- if you don't want! Give air! Ah, to breathe... I've forgotten what I have to say: Is there a God or is there none? Please remind me, I am a little confused. . . hard to breathe... There is no God, it seems to me... none... (p. 37) One would think that with this double movement the point of the play is made clear. Not for Levin, however. He has Job expressly utter his "final" judgment ("I don't care! / Take me off this stake! / There is no God-and this is final!"), only to make this very "finality" the butt of two "clowns" who summarize, choruslike, the contradictory "pathetic" and "cynical" aspects of the play's philosophical framing: "It is final," he says, and there is no one to remind him how many "finals" he has declared throughout his life. For what is Man? Here is Man:43 Once he said there is god, once he barked there's no god, Once he cried my sons, my sons; once he screamed my bottom, my bottom. So what is Man? Is it what he said yesterday, Or what he is crying now, or his forthcoming silence? If so, what is the thread tying it all together, Where is the thread, and what does it all mean? (p. 38) This high-minded query of the pathetic clown predictably elicits the mockery of the cynical clown: 43. Ecce homo!</page><page sequence="24">274 YAEL S. FELDMAN "What is Man? What is Life?" What is a fly? What is piles? Who cares where the thread is? Who cares what Man is? Who cares for the whole thing? (ibid.) As in the lullaby before, the mock-rhyme and rhythm serve only to under- line the irrelevance of these grand questions, as they stand in glaring contra- diction to the cynical attitude dramatized by the ringmaster throughout this scene: What are you standing like dummies? Don't you have any humanitarian spark? Give him water! We must prolong his death throes! A huge crowd is waiting at the door! (p. 39) Yet it is the pathetic, not the cynical, clown who has the last word in this scene. Significantly, the only image to survive the scathing deconstruction of this play is "father's tight arms." But even they are bound to lose their hold. In death, man is "alone, cloaked, like a high priest, in the simple gown, the secret of his death, the one each of us will don when the day comes" (p. 39). Had this been a tragedy, the playwright might have stopped here, leaving us with the cathartic effect of this open call for identification. Levin, however, would not let his spectator wallow in pity and fear. The protago- nist of his play is dead; his illusions (and ours) have been stripped off one after another, just like Peer Gynt's onion; but nothing that is existentially new has been learned through this process. In the final scene we witness the return of Levin's lowest specimen of human existence, the toothless beggar who can feed on vomit alone. Finding his sustenance in the bloody vomit of dead Job, he sounds the grotesque final movement of the play's ideational pendulum: "With some patience, someone finally throws up. Yes, somehow one lives. God exists" (p. 40). That the affirmation growing out of such "life" is doubtful, to say the least, is made clear by the chorus of the "dead" that concludes the play. Their eight-line "song," strangely beginning with the conjunctive "but," seems to answer directly to Yehuda Amichai's</page><page sequence="25">DECONSTRUCTING THE BIBLICAL SOURCES IN ISRAELI THEATER 275 famous parody of a central image in Hebrew liturgy (see our epigraph). While Amichai is critical of a world devoid of mercy, Levin does not even bother with this life. "But there is mercy in the world / and we will still rest," sing the "dead" at the conclusion of The Passion ofJob; it is the dead- ly peacefulness of nothingness beyond life that is the only solace left in a world that has witnessed the desecration of all human values. In such a world, neither Job nor Jesus, nor even the tropes of Zen Buddhism, can function as viable models of the sacred or the tragic. Instead, the absurd reigns supreme. We may now be in a better position to appreciate the source of the dramatic impact The Passion of Job exerted on Israeli theatergoers. As men- tioned above, this was the first time that Levin departed from the contem- porary scene and availed himself of "sacred" sources. At the same time, he did not give up either the theatrical worldview or the technique of the theater of the absurd. This resulted in an unprecedented deviation from both traditions-a formal experiment the audacity of which may have shaken the Israeli theater in unforeseen ways. By subjecting two pillars of the mythic infrastructure of Western culture to his relentless debunking, Levin denies even the minimal "religious" function attributed by Esslin to the theater of the absurd. Furthermore, the inclusion of Eastern mysticism within the Western system of belief makes the differentiation between the two impos- sible. The world created on the stage in this play negates not only the pos- sibility of revelation but even the existence of an "absent" and ineffable God. Levin's "god" is only a linguistic construct that comes into being and disappears with the life and death of the speaking subject. The radicalness of this proposition speaks for itself. It is rare when placed in the context of European theater and even rarer in the context of the Israeli stage. It may have helped, however, to get the Hebrew biblical drama out of the impasse in which it has found itself in the last two decades. In retrospect, Levin's irreverence may be viewed as a paradoxically neces- sary step for opening up new avenues to the biblical sources. In fact, by crossing the boundaries between various dramatic genres, different systems of belief, and diverging scriptural sources, Levin has forged a new theatrical language. This language appropriates both the sacred and the tragic while deconstructing them, painfully evoking a contemporary experience, one in</page><page sequence="26">276 YAEL S. FELDMAN which previous dichotomies have lost all meaning. That this experience is rooted in the post-Holocaust sensibility should come as no surprise. After all, no other event has so traumatically put into question the relevance of Jovian (and other) revelations of the sacred on one hand, and the value of human tragedy and suffering on the other. Yet this is not the whole picture. From an Israeli perspective, an addi- tional dichotomy has recently collapsed, that between '"Jewish" and "Hebrew." Somewhat belatedly, but nevertheless in a tangible way, the illu- sion of a separate Hebraic-Israeli identity does not seem tenable anymore. It is therefore not implausible to read the latent theological argument of The Passion of Job as a belated Israeli response to the negative theology, both Christian and Jewish, that has proliferated in the West in the last thirty years. In fact, there are some uncanny parallels between Levin's dramatiza- tion of the Job-Jesus story and the "Death of God" theology proposed by Richard Rubenstein.44 In a desperate attempt to rationalize the irrational, Rubenstein interprets Nazism as "a Judaeo-Christian heresy" (p. 19), a world "in which the Judaeo-Christian God is negated" (p. 35). This theo- logical realigning, as questionable as it may seem, does provide a valuable conceptual perspective for the composite structure of Levin's play. Not only does this perspective give new meaning to the splicing together of the Jewish-Christian sources, it actually contextualizes the Nazi misuse of lan- guage uttered by the "Roman" collectors, the diabolic cynicism of the ring- master, and above all-the anal-sadistic visual metaphors created on the stage in the second act. Whether or not we accept Rubenstein's psycho- analytic interpretation of Nazism as a regression into the anal freedom of infancy, "when little or no restraint impeded human impulse" (p. 36), we cannot ignore the fact that the Nazis did refer to Auschwitz as anus mundi.45 44. See in particular his "Death of God Theology and Judaism" and "Religion and the Origins of the Death Camps: A Psychoanalytic Interpretation," in After Auschwitz, pp. 243-266 and 1-46, respectively. 45.
