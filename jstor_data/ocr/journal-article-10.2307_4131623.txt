<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Miguel Cardozo. Selected Writings. Translated and Introduced by David J. Halperin. Classics of Western Spirituality. New York: Paulist Press, 2001. xxi, 411 pp. Abraham Miguel Cardozo is one of the most unusual and complex figures in the history of Jewish thought, but his identification with the Sabbateans caused him to be largely excluded from the study of that history, in his time and in ours. He had no impact to speak of on the larger development of Jewish ideas; yet, his biography and thought shed much light on the peculiarities of late-seventeenth- century Jewish identity. Cardozo was born to a New Christian (converso) family in Spain in 1626, and, after fleeing the Iberian Peninsula with his older brother, Isaac (who was the subject of a well-known biography by Yosef Hayim Yerushal- mi), reverted to Judaism in Italy in 1648. He had already completed university studies by this time, and his fine Iberian training in philosophy and theology left its mark on all his writings. Cardozo became deeply caught up in messianic fervor surrounding the ad- vent of Shabbatai Zvi in 1665-1666, and for the rest of his life his thought cen- tered on the struggle to understand the significance of Shabbatai's appearance. After Shabbatai converted to Islam, Cardozo became one of the most important theologians of the movement, opposing the views of Nathan of Gaza. Later he would contend with the relationship between Shabbatai's mission and his own very strong messianic identity. In Cardozo we find the coexistence of the skeptic, mys- tic, prophet, and philosopher. David Halperin's translation of works by Cardozo, with a preface by Elliot R. Wolfson and an extensive introduction and notes, appears in the excellent "Clas- sics of Western Spirituality" series from the Paulist Press, which has given the En- glish reader exposure to an impressive array of medieval, early modern, and 342</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews modern Jewish mystical texts. Cardozo may seem an odd character for this series-he is hardly a leading light of seventeenth-century Jewish spirituality- but Halperin's undertaking is highly useful for both scholar and student. Special- ists will continue to consult the voluminous texts of Cardozo in manuscript and the few in print, but for those with a more general interest in converso ideas, Sabbatean thought, and the late-seventeenth-century Sephardi context, this English volume supplies a great deal of material. The volume opens with Elliot Wolfson's learned discussion about Cardozo's complex identity, formed in the nexus of Christian and Jewish lives. Wolfson points out how this background affected Cardozo's Kaballah and Sabbatean thought in particular. The rest of the book is divided roughly thus: one-half texts from Cardozo in translation, one-fourth Halperin's introduction, and one-fourth notes. The exten- sive introduction and notes are absolutely critical for the non-specialist first en- countering this difficult thinker; but even experts will find novel approaches here. The introduction, called "The Man and His Universe," considers Cardozo's iden- tity as a "marrano," kaballist, messiah-bearer, theologian, magus, and wanderer. In the last section Halperin attempts to put together all this analysis, to answer the question, "Who was this man?" He concludes that Cardozo was a figure out of step with his time, the eternal outsider whose unusual perspective was valuable in ways his contemporaries could not yet fathom. Halperin's translation is fun to read because it is as much literary as literal. He is faithful to the text insofar as it is comprehensible through a straightforward rendering, but he brings across the complexities when they arise. His prose is col- orful and engrossing. The overall effect of the introduction and texts together is to create an image of Cardozo in the reader's mind that is appropriately vivid and in- tricate. Most of the selections are from printed texts, though Halperin has checked some of them against the manuscripts to enhance accuracy. They include autobio- graphical fragments, Sabbatean theology, polemics, and prophecies. Among the other features, background texts help the reader follow Cardozo's intent. I would highly recommend this volume for anyone studying early modern Jewish life and ideas. It is lively and useful, and both a primary and a secondary source.
