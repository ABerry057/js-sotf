<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Wyschogrod. The Body of Faith." Judaism as Corporeal Election. New York: Seabury Press, 1983. 265 pp. This book is about the chosenness of the Jewish people, a topic that has not been so seriously treated since Mordecai Kaplan rejected it decades ago</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 117 (e.g., The Future of the American Jew, pt. 2, chap. 13; The Sabbath Prayer- book, introduction). Wyschogrod returns again and again to the basic fact of biblical and rabbinic Judaism that the God of all humankind chose the Jews, that the universal Lord of creation elected a particular people. Furthermore, Wyschogrod maintains that by "election" Judaism does not mean ethnic distinctiveness with its patterns of culture, nor does it mean ethical sensitivi- ty with its civilizing mission among the nations, nor does it mean blindly nationalistic renewal. Election means the favored love bestowed by the Creator of all upon the children and children's children of Abraham and Sarah through the line of Isaac and Rebeccah, Jacob, Rachel, and Leah, for eternity. Chosenness is of the body-not the spirit, not of the mind, and not of culture. Reading this book is therefore difficult. Many modern Jews are embar- rassed by the "scandal of particularity." Some on intellectual grounds, fol- lowing Kaplan or liberal idealism; some on the grounds that standing out too much enabled persecution of the Jews and even the Holocaust to take place; and some because they think that the Holocaust irrevocably broke the promise of chosenness. Equality or blending, such readers think, would be better than blatant chosenness. Other modern Jews, swept up in the after- math of the Holocaust and the Six-Day War, are glad to hear the message of the inalienable bodily chosenness of the Jew. God's promises persist; the Jewish people lives. Christians too have difficulty reading this book. Liberal Christians tend toward an egalitarian, pluralistic understanding of religion that would exclude such exclusiveness. More conservative Christians realize that their own chosenness is rooted in God's election of the Jews. They are, as Paul would have it, gentiles "grafted into the vine of Israel," participants in holy history and in the promise of redemption because the Jews are chosen. If God rejects the Jews, the root is uprooted and the promise is not valid. They welcome Wyschogrod's insight, though it poses other theological problems for them. Even more conservative Christians, who believe that election through the spirit (faith) is superior to election through the body, will find this book a confirmation of their faith. And fundamentalist Christians of the dispensationalist type know that God has indeed chosen the Jews, for Christian purposes. For such readers, the book is true but short-sighted. This book is also about God. Wyschogrod maintains that God chose to manifest Himself in a love which humans could understand. His love is intimate, possessive, exclusive, even jealous. We call Him by an intimate</page><page sequence="3">118 BOOK REVIEWS Hebrew term, Hashem (pp. 92 ff.). His choosing of the Jews is a function of this anthropopathic love. With this theological insight, Wyschogrod takes a stand against the demythologization of philosophic religion, ontology, deontology, existentialism, and even the more abstract forms of mystical religion. It is not only Wyschogrod's clear avowal of the bodily chosenness of the Jews and the anthropopathic understanding of God that makes this book a challenge, it is also his learnedness. He has a very fine sense for the core of biblical theology and for the intricacies of rabbinic living, as well as a mas- tery over the Christian and contemporary philosophic sources. This is no sermon; it is a sustained defense of two embarrassing theses. Chapter 1 sets forth the basic metaphor of the book, one which recurs with considerable literary power-that light implies darkness, and darkness implies light. This means that the light of reason or consciousness has two limits: the fact of its being embodied, i.e., contained within the limits of human perception and thought, and the fact that reason must come up against the holy, which is itself not a form of reason. Both limits do not lead to despair but to a sense that, in human existence, light and darkness, consciousness and embodiedness, are inextricably intermingled. This metaphor lays the ground for the assertion that God's choosing a body, the seed of the Jewish people, is itself part of the reality of creation as He in- tended it. Thus, "delicatessen Judaism" is part of the body of Israel, as is the Jewish face, even though these do not seem to meet the criteria of "light" (pp. 26-27). This chapter also contains an interpretation of the binding of Isaac. Chapter 2, after an exposition of the relationship of Judaism and Chris- tianity to philosophy, returns to the theme of election under the rubric of love. God chose the seed of Abraham because He loved Abraham. The suggestions contained in rabbinic sources that Abraham's rejection of idolatry was the reason for God's love are only rationalizations. God loves the progeny of Abraham and Sarah; period. His love is always concrete, not abstract. Love is always exclusive; therefore, He is a jealous God. In a sharp appeal to the method of Karl Barth (pp. 75-81), Wyschogrod demands that these biblical indications of God's will be taken seriously. Theologically too, Wyschogrod argues that God as Creator affirms all of creation, even, and perhaps especially, the physical part thereof (pp. 66-71). Chapter 3 begins with a critique of Buber's Thou as too impersonal, given the anthropopathism of the biblical and rabbinic traditions. It then proceeds to an analysis of Hegel's slave-master paradigm in which lordship</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 119 implies the freedom of the servant. Both explications are very well done. Finally, Wyschogrod, in an excellent section (pp. 114-119), expounds God as the ground of meaning and the protection against meaninglessness. His contrast of the living body with the corpse and of the death of an animal with the breaking of a rock is very instructive. Chapter 4 is Wyschogrod's argument with Heidegger and the deontolo- gists. Acknowledging and interpreting Heidegger's Nazism (pp. 158-160), Wyschogrod offers a critique of the purely ontological as numinous but not personal, as monistic and hence transcending God, and as deethicized or amoral. All are incompatible with the God of Judaism. Deonotology, which advocates a breaking of being by action (pp. 155-160, well done), implies a monistic ontology and itself leads to a sanctioning of violence. Again Judaism, which understands all being as created being, cannot agree. Wyschogrod's fear that the chapter might be too technical is unfounded; it is quite clear for the college-educated reader. Chapter 5 first returns to history as part of the physical creation and hence something affirmed by God. It is in this arena that God works out His choosing. Then Wyschogrod turns to the balance between law, ethics, and God. The law needs interpretation, but election transcends the law because God did not choose a teaching but a people. This leads Wyschogrod to his critique of Orthodoxy, which he calls "the disobedience of orthodox Judaism." They have allowed the law to become self-sufficient, weakening the sense of responsibility to the God who elected the people, not just revealed the law (pp. 184-190, 207, 213). On the matter of the cult of the law, Wyschogrod could have been clearer, more forceful. Chapter 6 contains Wyschogrod's speculations about various aspects of contemporary Jewish culture in the light of his determination that the corporeal covenant is at the center of Jewish existence. He urges contact with secular Israel as willy-nilly part of the body of the elect; contact with gentiles as part of the global consciousness that characterizes creation and modern life; alertness to the unexpected spirituality inherent in certain people not normally identified as part of the religious hierarchy; the central- ity of the State of Israel, including Judea and Samaria; the reaffirmation of the unity of all Jewish people as the corpus elected by God, and the diminishing of the tensions that lead to divisiveness within the people; the stimulation of Jewish art; the renewed commitment to the Jewish communi- ty, especially to having Jewish children any one of whom might be the Messiah; and the renewal of messianic thinking and dreaming. There are other fine insights: the definition of what would constitute a</page><page sequence="5">120 BOOK REVIEWS break in Jewish identity (p. 244); that without Jews there would be no Torah (p. 28); etc. This book is thorough and deep; it deserves attentive reading and even pondering. Wyschogrod, however, has left several questions open for further discus- sion. First, what is the relationship between election and revelation, between the body and the law? To say that election transcends the law, that the inter- preter of the law is responsible to the will of the Lawgiver and not to the law itself, is true. So is the realization that without the body there is no revela- tion. But does Wyschogrod want to maintain that any legislation that leads to the loosening of the all-encompassing bond of election is sinful? Does he mean to make that a principle of Halakhah for use in the modern day? His emphasis on corporeal unity and his derogation of the divisiveness that characterizes much of Orthodoxy seem to support such a contention. But he has not said it clearly and has not given specific examples of how he would apply this. Second and correlated with the first, Wyschogrod indicates that, because Judaism is a religion of inalienable corporeal chosenness, it does not use creed as a principle of exclusion. Judaism tolerates heresies of all kinds. But what is the status of these heresies? Do they contain some truth value, or are they errors? If they are errors, they mislead, and in the arena of the public life of the Jewish people, they must be dealt with severely, as has been the case, and as Orthodoxy would have it even today if it controlled the Jewish community. If, however, these heresies have some truth value, some spark of the divine in them, then they deserve to be respected for what they are. Intel- ligent Jewish public policy, then, would require support for, perhaps even cultivation of, the varieties of Jewish existence. Wyschogrod has appealed for tolerance but has not dealt with the truth issue and its public policy correlative. Third, the above applies also to non-Jewish religions. What is their truth status, and how does one relate to them? Do gentile Christians, for example, actually share the covenant with us (is this another way of reading the medieval understanding of Christianity as a tool for the spread of mono- theism?), or is Christianity simply a delusion? Fourth, Wyschogrod's analysis of those sections of the law which appear to us as unethical needs more development in terms of his psychology of God and his portrayal of the role of the interpreter. It is not a new question, but it needs a fresher, fuller treatment. Finally, Wyschogrod has not written of the world and spirit of Jewish</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 121 piety. This is a book of theology, or better, of religious thought. But how does this relate to the piety of the observance of the commandments, to the various kinds of religious experience that activate the life of the chosen? To ponder the complete unpredictability of chosenness is one matter, an impor- tant one; to live the life of the chosen is another. Wyschogrod can answer this question; he must only write another book. David R. Blumenthal Emory University Atlanta, Ga.</page></plain_text>
