<plain_text><page sequence="1">326 BOOK REVIEWS Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi. Freud's Moses: Judaism Terminable and Inter- minable. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. xix, 159 pp. This is a stimulating study of Freud's controversial Moses and Monothe- ism, offering a number of new perspectives on Judaism, religion in general, Freud's problematic Jewish identity, and the psychoanalytic movement. Its origins in a series of public lectures give it a certain freshness of tone (the original format has been preserved, with appropriate footnotes added), and the many layers in Freud's preoccupation with the Moses figure and its implications for Judaism and Jewishness are excavated with a deftness and skill that deserve admiration. The "godless Jew" who created psychoanalysis emerges as far more committed to the embattled fate of his people than in the ethnic minimalist approach favored by cultural historians like Peter Gay. While this is not in itself new, the scholarship which is brought to bear does touch hitherto-unexplored areas, and Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi's "monologue with Freud," conducted in the first person, cleverly succeeds in recovering fragments of a Jewish identity which the master only hinted at. The tantalizing conclusion seems to be that in some peculiar sense not fully accessible to our understanding, psychoanalysis was perhaps (after all that has been said for and against) a "Jewish" science. While agreeing with many of the points Yerushalmi makes, it nev- ertheless seems to me that his work is in important respects flawed in its presentation of the context in which Freud's Jewish identity needs to be seen. In the first instance, there is little discussion or insight into the Viennese and Central European Jewish background out of which Freud came, and which in my opinion largely conditioned his responses and attitudes to "Jewish" questions. Certainly, we are given a glimpse of the threatening, tragic atmosphere of the 1930s, of the collapse of democracy, the rise of Hitler in Germany, the rampant antisemitism, and the disaster which engulfed the psychoanalytic movement, but even this is sketched in rather fragmentary fashion. The fact, however, that Freud's whole life, career, and scientific preoccupations had been influenced by the hostility of his Austrian environment since the early 1880s is not sufficiently brought out. Can we really isolate a text like Moses and Monotheism from this long period of gestation (lasting nearly half a century) in which Freud had to work out complicated strategies of adaptation, survival, and defiance toward those who were fundamentally antagonistic to his whole demarche? Can the historian afford to discuss Freud independently of the position of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 327 other psychoanalysts who confronted their Jewishness (Rank, Reich, Reik, etc.), of Jewish intellectuals and artists like Schnitzler, Zweig, Schoenberg, Horkheimer, Benjamin, or Kafka, to name only a few obvious examples? Schoenberg, in particular, a fellow-Viennese contemporary of Freud, no less obsessed with Moses, would have provided a much-needed comparative dimension to illustrate the problem of the secular Jewish intellectual in twentieth-century Central Europe, one that might have added much to Yerushalmi's account. Moreover, if we confine ourselves to Freud alone, it is difficult to understand why there is no discussion of a work like Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, which was published in 1905 and shows Freud's familiarity with and fondess for Galician Jewish humor. This provides a counterpoint to the more obsessive quality of Freud's involvement with Moses and at the same time an illustration of the spontaneous side of Freud's acknowledgment of the East European Jewishness he inherited from his family roots. One of the more ingenious aspects of Yerushalmi's account is his decoding of the meaning of the famous inscription in Hebrew which Jacob Freud dedicated to his ambitious son on his thirty-fifth birthday. He argues that Moses and Monotheism can be seen as a belated response by Freud to his father's mandate not to neglect the sources of wisdom and understanding to be found in the "book of books," while not abandoning his own independent secular standpoint. This is an original idea but somewhat speculative, since we have no evidence that Freud really understood the inscription or had any profound interest in what it implied. Indeed, several of the examples Yerushalmi brings to demonstrate Freud's knowledge of Hebrew and/or Yiddish seem similarly strained (e.g., that he named his dog Jofie, meaning "beauty" in Hebrew), and other instances which might have made the same point more effectively are overlooked. While agreeing very much with Yerushalmi about the importance of Freud's Jewish consciousness, it appears at times as if he has gone too far the other way in rejecting the "atheist" antipathy in Freud to any parochial, religious-based sense of Jewish identity. Yerushalmi's discussion of Freud's sentiments about Jewish nationalism also strikes me as incomplete. The evidence here is admittedly contradictory, with Freud expressing a qualified approval of Zionism as an assertion of Jewish dignity and honor on some occasions but also disbelieving in the possibility of a Jewish state and reproving any manifestation of Jewish chauvinism. But here context is all-important, and by the time he wrote</page><page sequence="3">328 BOOK REVIEWS Moses and Monotheism, it is surely a little astonishing that Freud had not warmed more enthusiastically to the centrality of Palestine as a refuge for Central European Jews. More attention might have been paid to this absence and indeed to the psychological block that Freud had in dealing psychoanalytically with the phenomenon of antisemitism. Moses and Monotheism admittedly provides the beginnings of a possible approach to the subject, but again it would seem in retrospect a woefully inadequate response to such a burning issue on the eve of the Second World War. One wonders why Yerushalmi did not take this subject further and consider the inhibitions that it suggests in Freud's entire approach to the "Jewish question." Yerushalmi makes some telling points about the gulf between Freud's public posture on Jewish issues (cautious, objective, restrained) and the warmer feelings he displayed in private-which also frequently betrayed his own resentment at the Gentile world. Here, too, the dichotomy might have been expanded to point to the kind of duality and ambivalence exhibited by so many Central European Jewish intellectuals. Curiously, the strongest statement by Freud of what he owed to his Jewish heritage-namely, his freedom from dogma and prejudice, and the ability to stand alone in opposition to conventional wisdoms-is barely mentioned. Similarly neglected are the assimilationist pressures and complicated relationship of Freud to German and Austrian culture (not to mention society and politics) which run right through his life and work. On the other hand, Yerushalmi is much more convincing in discussing the relation between Judaism and Christianity as refracted in Freud's Moses, suggesting that "fratricide" needs to be seen as an additional explanation for Christian hostility over the centuries toward the Jews. The theological struggle over the birthright of Israel and the deep, underlying insecurity of Christians seeking to usurp the "chosenness" of the Jewish people are indeed important adjuncts to any Freudian explanation based on a conflict between "father" and "son" religions. Sigmund Freud, of course, did not return to the religion of his ancestors, and denied not only that Moses was a Jew, but also the central position in history that the Jews have claimed as the "chosen" people. That was part of his iconoclasm and tenacious psychoanalytic insistence on abandoning all narcissistic illusions and false consolations. But Yerushalmi does succeed in showing that he recognized the extraordinary power of origins, of tradition and inherited myths over our consciousness, and identified with the victory</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 329 of "spirituality" entailed in the original Mosaic project. In a curious roundabout way, the Jewish God of abstraction-formless, austere, and sternly moral-returns in Freud's last work as a vindication of Geistlichkeit. As the Nazis plunged Europe into the ultimate abyss of barbarism, Freud, in his own tortured struggle for clarity, bravely tried to reaffirm the claims of reason over the dark side of the human psyche.
