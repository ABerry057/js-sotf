<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE IN MEDIEVAL JEWISH PHILOSOPHY by SEYMOUR FELDMAN Ve-aharei kikhlot ha-kol ... And after everything has ceased to exist... -Adon 'Olam Both the Bible and the earliest Greek philosophers begin with accounts of the world's genesis. It is thus not surprising that medieval cosmological thought was preoccupied, perhaps obsessed, with the issue of creation. But what about the end of the world? If the universe had a beginning, does it necessarily have an end? Does creation imply destruction? On this topic the Bible is not so explicit and unambiguous. Greek philosophy, however, was virtually unanimous in claiming that whatever has a beginning will have an end, and that whatever will have an end had a beginning. If this cosmologi- cal principle is construed strictly, then the world's past and its future are essentially and necessarily linked together, such that the finitude of one entails the finitude of the other. This would mean that if the temporal his- 53</page><page sequence="2">54 SEYMOUR FELDMAN tory of the world is finite a parte ante, then by virtue of this cosmological principle it will have a temporal end a parte post. The most vigorous and detailed defense of the strict interpretation of this general principle was given by Aristotle, who attempted to prove it in his treatise On the Heavens. Henceforth, I shall refer to this principle as "Aristotle's theorem." However, in Plato we find a weaker version of this principle. Although in general all generated objects are indeed corruptible, especially if they are material objects, it is possible, Plato believed, for God to intervene and to prevent a body from decomposing. And so it was, according to Plato, at the creation of the world: the Divine Craftsman created the heavenly bodies but endowed them with the capacity ab extra to endure infinitely a parte post. Plato makes clear that this capacity is not inherently natural but is possessed by the heavenly bodies deo volente. Thus, for Plato the world has a temporal beginning, but no temporal end; their incorruptibility is, however, a divine gift.2 In their different interpretations of the same general cosmological prin- ciple, Plato and Aristotle suggest different theologies. In the Platonic theology the divine power is conceived as a voluntary creative power endowed with ethical attributes whose concern for its handiwork is so great that it wills, virtually contra naturam, to keep the world going forever. For Plato, therefore, divine benevolence is paramount. To Aristotle, however, the deity is an impersonal, remote motive force that eternally sustains the eternal, incessant motions of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle's deity is neither benevolent nor malevolent; it wills nothing. Moreover, in the Platonic world divine omnipotence is revealed precisely in the capacity to create nature; in Aristotle the divine power is manifested precisely in the deity's immutability and perfection. That the world will have no end is for Plato clear proof that God is supra naturam, since otherwise the world would self-destruct; that the world cannot have an end is for Aristotle clear proof that no deity could have created it. Cosmology reflects, therefore, theology. The Bible too links cosmology with theology. After all, the universe's beginning, according to Genesis, is an act of a God who rejoices in and is 1.

It is sufficient to note that they too adhere to Aristotle's theorem (Seneca, Natural Questions 3. 28-30; Lucretius, On the Nature of Things 5, 11. 226-434).</page><page sequence="3">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 55 satisfied with His creation. It is quite clear ab initio that the biblical God too is endowed with ethical attributes and that these qualities are exemplified in the very act of creation. But it is not clear how these attributes can be sus- tained if the universe will come to an end. A strict application of Aristotle's theorem would imply that the universe would cease to exist. But if that were so, how would the world's demise affect biblical theology? Would the universe's "running down" and ultimate destruction have any impact upon how we should conceive of God? Could the deity still be thought of as good and omnipotent? As we shall see, some medieval Jewish cosmologists believed that the world's destruction is incompatible with the notion of a benevolent and beneficent God. For these thinkers, as for Plato, God's benevolence was of primary importance. Accordingly, they had recourse to the Platonic cosmological model of a created but everlasting universe. Nevertheless, other Jewish thinkers were more concerned with the theologi- cal principle of divine omnipotence, which they interpreted in a very strong sense. Accordingly, for these theologians God's power to create implies His power to destroy, and conversely. Any restriction on His power is a theo- logical affront and offense. Thus, these thinkers accepted Aristotle's theorem in its strict sense, although they apply it differently from Aristotle's own application of it. For, whereas Aristotle employs the principle to deny creation and destruction altogether, some medievals use it to affirm both creation and destruction. To Aristotle and also to these theologians, the Platonic, or looser, interpretation of this principle seems absurd, both cosmologically and theologically. Either the universe is without beginning and end, eternally coexistent with God, who is prior not in time but only in causality and being; or the world is freely created by God, who can destroy it ad libitum. That the universe could have a beginning but no end was for Aristotle a cosmological-logical blunder; to some medievals it was religious blasphemy. We see then that by virtue of Aristotle's theorem an answer to the ques- tion of the world's end constitutes an answer to the question of its alleged beginning. In some respects it is even easier to argue ad originem a fine. For if the world had a beginning, it was a long time ago, and no one is around now to tell us how it happened. But if the world has an end, it will have one because there is some present fact about it or God that constitutes a suffi- cient condition for its eventual demise. Once we discover this condition, we can then not only predict its destruction but retrodict its beginning. Perhaps such a fact will tell us something about God too, particularly whether He is</page><page sequence="4">56 SEYMOUR FELDMAN omnipotent and benevolent. Thus, arguing from the end of the universe to its beginning is both cosmologically and theologically economical. In this essay I shall examine several medieval cosmologists who considered the question of the universe's end and who recognized the relevance and impor- tance of Aristotle's theorem. Some of them construed this principle strictly but used it against Aristotle to defend a strong version of the traditional doctrine of creation; for these thinkers God created the world ex nihilo and will reduce it ad nihilum. Others, however, adopt the weaker Platonic ver- sion of this principle and defend the thesis of the world's indestructibility. II From a strictly chronological point of view, Philo of Alexandria was the first Jewish thinker to provide a philosophical cosmology. Yet in terms of his historical significance for Jewish religious philosophy, Philo can be ignored. For until the late sixteenth century Philo was lost to the Jewish world, and hence had no impact upon medieval Jewish philosophy.3 My discussion will, therefore, begin with Saadiah Gaon (d. 942), whose Book of Beliefs and Opinions is really the first significant treatise of philosophical theology in Judaism. Influenced) by the Muslim school of rationalist theology, the Mu'taziliya Kalhm, Saadiah believed that the best approach to the understanding of God, particularly His existence and attributes, was to prove first the creation of the universe. A created world is after all the clearest sign of the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent Creator. So Saadiah devotes the first book of his treatise to the question of creation, which he discusses in considerable detail. Yet, as several modern scholars have noted, the first of Saadiah's proofs for creation-"the argument from finitude"-is really an argument to creation from the destruction of the universe. Accordingly it will be useful to begin our discussion with this argument. Saadiah's cosmology is a good starting point for another reason. As Wolfson and Davidson have shown, in this particular proof Saadiah makes use of material taken from the sixth-century Greek-Christian philo- sopher John Philoponus, whose influence upon medieval Muslim-Jewish 3. Philo's views on the world's end are not clear, since the topic is discussed in detail in only one book, whose authenticity some scholars have doubted, De aeternitate mundi. F. H. Colson discusses this matter in the introduction to his translation of this work in the Loeb Classical Library series.</page><page sequence="5">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 57 philosophy was quite significant.4 Throughout this essay I shall refer to Philoponus on several occasions; thus some discussion of Philoponus' cosmological principles, as well as Saadiah's application of them, will be relevant.5 Although Philoponus wrote many commentaries upon Aristotle's writ- ings, he was basically an anti-Aristotelian, especially in natural philosophy and cosmology. This is particularly evident in his attempt to refute the cosmological thesis of the eternity of the world, a doctrine that had become a dogma of the Aristotelian and Plotinian philosophies. In his several treatises devoted to the refutation of this thesis, Philoponus defended both the biblical doctrine of creation, which he interpreted as creation ex nihilo, and the strict form of Aristotle's theorem. This is quite evident in his long treatise De aeternitate mundi contra Proclum. In this work, he uses the theorem to prove creation from destruction. His general strategy is to adopt the Platonic principle that all physical entities and systems are, in our terminology, entropic, i.e., inherently self-destructing and corruptible. In Philoponus' own words, the universe suffers from parektrope, literally a "turning away from," which is an irreversible process toward disorder and disintegration. Plato insisted that bodies are essentially mutable and as such continually lose energy such that they ultimately decompose.6 As Philo- ponus puts it, bodies are always "flowing," and thus their internal energy is continuously dissipating.7 4.

Saadiah gives a particularly Aristotelian flavor to the Philoponian notion of entropy. Aristotle himself argued that bodies have finite force because they are finite in size.8 If this is so, then as a body expends energy its force diminishes; eventually the energy level of a body should ultimately dissipate and the body decompose. Without stating Aristotle's theorem explicitly but clearly assuming it, Saadiah then infers that the universe as a whole must have had a beginning. A more exact formulation of the argument would explicitly incorporate Aristotle's theorem as a premise, and then conclude from the universe's end that it had a beginning. The virtue of this argument, as Philoponus recognized, is that it is based entirely on Aristotelian physics. A consistent adherence to the latter requires the affirmation of the creation of the world as well as of its destruc- tion! Thus, a strict interpretation of Aristotle's theorem implies the falsity of Aristotle's claim that the universe is eternal. III This strict interpretation of Aristotle's theorem and its cosmological consequences was not unanimously adopted in later Jewish philosophy. Maimonides and Gersonides shared Saadiah's belief in the world's creation but denied his contention that it will be destroyed. Accordingly, they had to reject or qualify Aristotle's theorem. Maimonides' treatment of this problem is unfortunately brief and primarily exegetical rather than philosophical. His discussion of the world's end is more of an addendum to his main con- cern, the universe's beginning. Gersonides, however, was quite concerned to prove philosophically the incorruptibility of the universe and to argue in detail against Aristotle's theorem. Moreover, these two thinkers not only differed in their methods and emphases but also in the strength of their belief in the world's everlastingness. For Maimonides, the universe is, as Plato had maintained, inherently destructible but lasts forever by virtue of God's will. I shall call this thesis "weak indestructibility." Gersonides, however, argued that the universe is inherently indestructible. This thesis I call "strong 8. Aristotle, On the Heavens 1. 5-7; Physics 8. 10.</page><page sequence="7">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 59 indestructibility." I shall begin with Maimonides' weaker version of the claim that the universe is everlasting.9 Maimonides maintains first that unlike the belief in creation, the doctrine of the world's indestructibility is not a dogma, not a "foundation of the Torah." Thus, one should not be surprised to find no unanimity on this issue. Second, Aristotle's theorem is true only for natural phenomena within the world, or "particular generated things." But since the issue in question concerns the whole universe, whose beginning was miraculous, or super- natural, the application of this theorem to the question of the whole world's end is a petitio principii. Like Plato, Maimonides believes that the universe is inherently destructible but indestructible by virtue of God's will. Just as God can cause the generated souls of the righteous to survive their bodies' decay, so He can make the created universe last forever. Finally, Maimon- ides proceeds to find support for this thesis in Scripture, citing several verses in Ecclesiastes in which King Solomon suggests that the universe as a whole is indestructible: "But the earth remains the same forever" (Eccles. 1:4); and "whatever God has brought to pass will recur evermore" (Eccles. 3:14). King David too believed in this doctrine, as we can see from Psalms 104:5 and 148:6: "He established the earth on its foundations so that it shall never totter"; and "He made them [i.e., the heavens] endure forever." In these verses, Maimonides contends, the key phrases are le-'olam and 'olam va-'ed, which to him connote the indestructibility of the universe as a fact depen- dent upon God's will. Biblical passages that seem to indicate the contrary are to be reinterpreted.'0 Although the burden of Maimonides' argument for the world's everlast- ingness is exegetical, there is a suggestion of a philosophical argument at the end of chapter 28 of part 2 of the Guide. Commenting upon the verse "that 9. It will be useful, as well as both philosophically and philologically accurate, to ke,.p distinct the terms "eternal" (awivos) and "everlasting" (&amp;tOtos). To say that the universe is eternal is to claim that it has neither a beginning nor an end; to say that it is everlasting is to claim only that it has no end. The former is the thesis of Aristotle; the latter is the thesis of Plato, Maimonides, and Gersonides. In medieval philosophical Hebrew "eternal" was usually rendered by kadmon, and "everlasting" by ni;hi. But this practice was not always or consistent- ly adhered to. In his translation of Maimonides' Guide, Samuel ibn Tibbon makes this termino- logical distinction. Gersonides more frequently uses the compound phrase bilti yifased, i.e., "incorruptible," than ni;hi (Gersonides, The Wars of the Lord [Milhamot Hashem], bk. 6, pt. 1, chaps. 16 and 27). 10. Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed 2:27-29.</page><page sequence="8">60 SEYMOUR FELDMAN whatsoever God does it shall be forever [le-'olam]; nothing can be added to it nor anything taken away from it" (Eccles. 3:14), Maimonides notes that the reason why the universe is (at least according to King Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes) everlasting (ni;hi) is that a perfect creator makes a perfect product, and a perfect product has no inherent cause of decay or corruption. Once created the world will, therefore, continue to exist without interruption or major change." This argument is supported by another passage in the Guide where Maimonides criticizes a talmudic sage for suggesting that God created and destroyed several worlds before He created this one which pleased him.'2 If God is perfect, how could He create some- thing that is imperfect and thus needs to be replaced with another that is more perfect? The principle of perfection requires that a perfect artisan make a perfect product.'3 The implication here is that in and of itself the universe has no deficiency (besron) that would naturally lead to its ultimate demise. This was an important point for Gersonides, who developed it in greater detail. Maimonides allows, however, for the supranatural destructi- bility of the world; since God created the world ad libitum, He can annihilate it ad libitum. Such an act would be, of course, a miracle, just as the creation of the world was. Both creation and annihilation are uniquely divine acts (havayah reponit, hefsed regoni) that freely bring about or do away with a total system; they are not natural phenomena. Thus, Aristotle's theorem is restricted to instances of natural generation and corruption that follow strictly natural law.14 If Maimonides' treatment of this problem is primarily exegetical, this is not true for the next major Jewish thinker who discusses in detail the ques- tion of the world's indestructibility. Levi ben Gershom (Gersonides) offers a vigorous and thorough philosophical analysis of this problem and attempts to prove philosophically that the universe must be indestructible." This is 11. The term "major" has to be used here to allow for miracles, which are, for Maimon- ides, only temporary changes in nature. 12. Guide 2:30. The rabbinic passage is from Genesis Rabbah 3. 13. Already in Plato we find the seeds of this argument, which are nurtured later by Proclus into an even stronger version of the world's indestructibility (Plato, Timaeus 30a-d, 33a-d, 37d; Proclus in Philoponus, De aeternitate 8-9). 14. Guide 2:27 and 29. Thomas Aquinas seems to have the same position on this matter as Maimonides (Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I q. 104 a.4). 15. S.

Baron Jubilee Volume (1975), vol. 1, pp. 383-405.</page><page sequence="9">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 61 clearly a stronger claim than Maimonides' version of the thesis. Gersonides' defense of strong indestructibility contains both a critique of Aristotle's theorem and a rejection of Philoponus' argument from finite forces. As a result of the former he is able to say that the universe is both generated yet incorruptible; as a result of the latter he is able to avoid the conclusion of Philoponus' argument from entropy. In defending strong indestructibility Gersonides pushes even further the principle of perfection used by Maimonides. A perfect craftsman would have neither a reason for not making a perfect product ab initio nor a reason for destroying what he has in fact made. If God could have made a more perfect world but did not, it would be legitimate to ask, why not? Is He niggardly or jealous? If having made the world God should decide to destroy it, again we are entitled to ask, why? Is He angry with it? Did He botch the job and now wants to do it over? Clearly, none of these answers will do. God is not stingy, nor does He become vindictive; moreover, if He does anything at all, He does it right. So there is no "sufficient reason" for His wanting either to make a less-than-perfect world ab initio or to destroy the one that He in fact did make. Even more than Leibniz, Gersonides is committed to a very strong form of both the principle of divine perfection and the principle of sufficient reason. A perfect Creator cannot destroy what He makes because He could have no reason for doing it.'6 What about Aristotle's theorem? Doesn't it entail the corruption of that which is generated? If so, since Gersonides defends the creation of the universe, shouldn't he admit at least the possibility of its destruction? This much even Maimonides conceded. Gersonides answers by rejecting Aris- totle's theorem not merely with respect to its applicability to a miraculous act, such as creation or annihilation (as did Maimonides), but also as a general principle of physics. In short, Aristotle makes the mistake of con- flating the concepts of contingency and of corruptibility. An entity is con- tingent insofar as it is not eternal; for eternity and necessity are convertible properties, according to Aristotle. Now something is contingent so long as it is either generated or corruptible. A contingent being can, however, be contingent by satisfying only one of these conditions. The world as a whole is for Gersonides generated; it is, therefore, contingent. Nevertheless, its 16. Gersonides, Wars of the Lord, bk. 6, pt. 1, chap. 16; Aristotle, On Generation and Corruption 1. 7.</page><page sequence="10">62 SEYMOUR FELDMAN contingency does not per se imply its corruptibility.17 To be corruptible an entity would have to contain some inherent cause of decay that ultimately leads to its demise. But in our world there are many items that do not possess any such internal causes of corruption; e.g., celestial bodies, a point insisted upon by Aristotle himself. Thus, although the heavenly bodies are generated, as Gersonides establishes elsewhere, they are not corruptible, because they were not created with any inherent causes of decay.'8 Thus, not only is there no sufficient reason a parte Dei for the world's destruction, there is in addition no essential cause a parte mundi for its own corruption. Gersonides' ontology comprises, then, two basic kinds of entities: (1) the necessary per se being; (2) the contingent per se being. The former is eternal, having no temporal origin and no end; the latter is subject to duration, either definite or indefinite. There is only one entity that belongs to class 1: God. All other things are members of class 2. Yet within this latter class there are differences: (2a) some of its members are contingent in having both a temporal origin and an end (e.g., Napoleon); (2b) others have an origin but no end (e.g., the angel Gabriel, Moses). Things that belong to subclass 2a have definite duration; those in 2b have indefinite duration. The angels, heavenly bodies, and thus the world as a whole belong to class 2b; individual terrestrial substances belong to 2a, except for some human souls, which are capable of immortality. All of the members of class 2 are then contingent, and thus noneternal; but some of them are incorruptible, and thus ever- lasting. Plato and Maimonides dimly saw this distinction but did not work it out systematically and thoroughly. Gersonides' final point is directed against Philoponus and the Kaldm, as well as Aristotle and Proclus. As we have seen, one of Philoponus' more original and incisive arguments against the latter two thinkers had to do with the Aristotelian principle, accepted by Proclus, that a finite body can have only finite force. If it is the case, Philoponus and Saadiah argued, that all bodies have finite force, then they will cease to be active and will even- tually disintegrate. Philoponus and Saadiah were primarily interested in using destructibility to prove creation; so they applied Aristotle's theorem to conclude that the universe is generated. Now in later medieval philosophy 17. Gersonides, Wars of the Lord, bk. 6, pt. 1, chap. 27; Aristotle, On the Heavens 1.12; C. J. Williams, "Aristotle and Corruptibility," Religious Studies 1 (1965): 95-107, 203-215; S. Waterlow, Passage and Possibility (Oxford, 1982). 18. Aristotle, Physics 8. 10; On the Heavens 1. 5-7; Davidson, "The Principle."</page><page sequence="11">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 63 there were several attempts to blunt the force of this argument, which is quite persuasive since it is based upon Aristotelian principles. Averroes, for example, distinguished between two aspects of the finite force of celestial body: its intensity and its extensity, or duration. Admittedly, the velocity or level of illumination of a heavenly body is finite in magnitude; nevertheless, Averroes contends, this finite degree of energy can be sustained for infinite time if the cause of the body having the force keeps the body going. Since the heavenly bodies differ crucially from mundane bodies in having as their causes of motion incorporeal Separate Movers, they are capable of both infinite duration and infinitely enduring force, even if the degrees of that force are finite.'9 Although Gersonides criticized Averroes' proposed solu- tion of Philoponus' objection for reasons that are not directly relevant to our theme, he nevertheless rejected as well Philoponus' argument against Aristotle and Proclus, even though he was committed to a creation doctrine. As we shall see, Gersonides' rejection of Philoponus' argument undermined several important elements of Aristotelian physics. According to Gersonides, the gradual diminution and eventual cessation of motion in a moving body results from either or both of the following causes: (1) the relation between the mover and the moved changes because the motion of the moving body uses up its internal heat, or energy; (2) the mover imparts to the moved body a force such that the latter moves in a direction contrary to its natural motion. For example, when a man walks for a period of time he eventually suffers fatigue because (1) the walking itself uses up his inner thermal energy, and (2) his natural downward motion qua body is opposed by his voluntary motion to walk up a hill or in a straight, level path. Now, consider what would happen if we were to drop a stone from some height. First, the dropping does not impart to the stone a motion contrary to its normal downward movement. Thus, the second condition for loss of kinetic energy is not satisfied. Moreover, the longer the stone moves the greater its velocity and impact will be. This shows that the first condition is not satisfied either; for instead of losing energy as it moves the stone gains momentum.20 When we apply these principles to the heavenly bodies, it is even more 19.

Touati, La Pensee philosophique et theologique de Gersonide (Paris, 1973), pp. 308-315.</page><page sequence="12">64 SEYMOUR FELDMAN apparent that they move continuously ad infinitum by their own nature. For there is no change in the initial kinetic relationship between them and their movers, even if the latter be some internal power or form, since the heavenly bodies only change with respect to place, which is not a change that affects them essentially. Nor do they have any intrinsic motion contrary to the motion that they always exhibit. Accordingly, once set in motion by the initial act of creation, they will continue to move without real change ad infinitum. Thus, we have proved the inherent incorruptibility of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and of the universe as a whole.21 IV Gersonides' vigorous defense of the intrinsic indestructibility of the universe did not go unchallenged. It was too strong for the more traditional- minded thinkers, for whom even Maimonides' more moderate version was also unacceptable. In the early fifteenth century this question was discussed critically by the Spanish-Jewish theologian Hasdai Crescas, who considered the world's destructibility to be among those beliefs that lack dogmatic status but have some degree of rational plausibility and traditional support. By not having dogmatic status a thesis is religiously neutral, and a believer in Judaism is entitled either to maintain or to reject such a belief. Crescas discusses thirteen such beliefs, the first of which is whether the universe will be everlasting. Before I examine his argumentation, one preliminary obser- vation is in order. Crescas' treatment of this topic inherits some of the ambivalence or ambiguity of his discussion of creation. Unlike most of his predecessors in Jewish philosophy, Crescas was not opposed to the idea that the universe is eternally created by God. His primary concern was to stress God's eternal creativity, and he allowed for two different versions of God's eternal creativity: (1) the universe could eternally emanate from God a la Plotinus, Proclus, Al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina; or (2) there could be an indefinite series of finitely enduring worlds. The second alternative is for Crescas the more traditional Jewish position, and in behalf of this view he quotes the rabbinic saying criticized by Maimonides: "Rabbi Abbahu infers 21. Here Gersonides agrees also with Proclus (Philoponus, De aeternitate bk. 1. 3; bk. 9. 6). Leibniz admitted that God could choose to annihilate the universe but just wouldn't (Leibniz, Monadology, pars. 4-6; Letters to Clarke, V, pars. 73-76).</page><page sequence="13">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 65 that God created and destroyed worlds until He made this one, which pleased Him." Crescas understands this dictum to be compatible with the view that the universe could be destroyed or disintegrated and then be replaced by another world. Crescas wants to rule out any theory that would restrict God's power, and he believes that the doctrine of a unique universe of only finite duration implies such a limitation. Now, since there are for Crescas two cosmogonies that are both theologically and philosophically acceptable, it should not surprise us that his views about the world's end are also "open." 22 Since the question of the universe's end is not a dogma of Judaism, Crescas' method of exposition differs here from his usual procedure of first stating the "orthodox" theological position based upon Scripture and then providing the philosophical defense of it. On the present topic, he begins by citing the philosophical arguments for and against the world's everlasting- ness (ni;ziyyut), citing in addition appropriate scriptural and rabbinic support texts; then he gives a critical analysis of these arguments and presents his conclusions. For the sake of brevity, I shall not rehearse the arguments or cite the proof-texts but extract from this material those points that are particularly relevant to the preceding discussion. Ever since Proclus, one persistent problem that the defenders of the world's destruction had to answer was, How could something that is evil, i.e., destruction, be attributed to a good God, who produced the world in the first place out of goodness? Not finding any sense in any of the proposed answers to this question, Proclus, Gersonides, and other defenders of strong indestructibility emphatically denied that God could destroy the universe, since such an act would be incompatible with His nature. Philoponus had replied to this argument by claiming that just as in creating the universe God acted out of His goodness, so in destroying it or in allowing it to self- destruct God acts in accordance with His goodness. Both creation and destruction are divine voluntary acts that are different but equally appro- priate phases of God's plan, whose ultimate purposes elude human compre- hension.23 Implicit in Philoponus' reply to Proclus is the view that whatever God wills or does is good. Crescas replies to Proclus' objection in a different way. He distinguishes 22. Crescas, The Light of the Lord (Or Adonai), bk. 3, principle 1, chap. 5; bk. 4, question 1; S. Feldman, "The Theory of Eternal Creation in Hasdai Crescas and Some of His Predeces- sors," Viator 11 (1980): 289-320.</page><page sequence="14">66 SEYMOUR FELDMAN between two kinds of evil: (1) an essential evil, the doing of which indicates that the agent is really bad; (2) an accidental evil, the occurrence of which does not impute any real evil in the agent, who either performs the act or permits it to occur. For example, if God were the direct cause, or proximate agent, of an innocent man's death, then God would be a murderer. If, however, Cain for his own reasons murdered Abel, God would not be culpable even though He endowed Cain with the power of choice whereby Cain murdered Abel and then permitted Cain to exercise this power. Rela- tive to God, Abel's murder was an accidental evil, whereas with respect to Cain it was an essential evil. Now in the case of the universe's destruction, Crescas argues, if it does happen it will not be an essential evil; for the destruction would occur by virtue of the "necessity of matter," or the intrinsic tendency toward corruption characteristic of all corporeal entities. Here Crescas is quite close to Philoponus' argument from entropy. The destruction of the world would then be only accidental relative to God, even though He "permitted" it by virtue of the fact that He created it and allowed it to proceed toward its natural end. Moreover, if this world were to be replaced by another universe that is more perfect, God could have a good reason for destroying this world. A series of finitely enduring worlds of increasing perfection would be for Crescas theologically acceptable. So Proclus' and Gersonides' demand for a "sufficient reason" has then been satisfied. 24 The second difficulty inherent in the claim that the world is destructible is the fact alleged by Proclus and Gersonides that the heavenly bodies are immune from the causes of decay definitive of terrestrial bodies, i.e., the natural contrariety of earthly matter which inevitably results in change. On this point, Crescas is somewhat ambivalent. Initially he says that there is some contrariety in the heavenly bodies, i.e., the diverse directions of move- ment: some of them move east to west, whereas others move west to east, and still others move in both directions at different times. This contrariety, at least with respect to locomotion, implies the possibility of destruction, 23. Philoponus, De aeternitate, bk. 4. 9, p. 78, 11. 6-10, p. 79, 11. 4-11; bk. 6. 4, p. 130, 1. 22-p. 131, 1. 10. 24. Crescas does not appear to be committed to the Leibnizian claim that God must create the best possible world. For a contemporary discussion of this problem, see Robert Adams, "Must God Create the Best?" Philosophical Review 81 (1972): 317-332. The argument against the successive divine creation of several worlds of increasing perfection appears in Aristotle's early De Philosophia, fragment 19C. See Sorabji, TCC, p. 281.</page><page sequence="15">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 67 and whatever is possible will, it would be plausible to assume, sooner or later eventuate. Thus, the universe will be destroyed by virtue of its own nature. Yet Crescas seems to withdraw from this radical conclusion. He blunts the force of this Philoponian argument in several ways. First, the contrary movements of the heavenly bodies are only accidental; they do not affect the essential nature of these bodies. In other words, locomotion is the "least" kind of change, and even though a body may manifest contrary motions, it doesn't follow that these motions imply an essential change in the body itself. Second, even if these contrary movements could be consi- dered to be essential changes, it is within God's infinite power to keep them going ad indefinitum, as Averroes had claimed, since the law that states the ultimate cessation or decomposition of a system exhibiting contrariety is just a law of nature; but God can suspend any such law. Indeed, this holds true even for Aristotle's theorem, which, as Maimonides claimed, is normally applicable only to natural occurrences of individual generations and corrup- tions. However, in the case of the world we are ex hypothesi dealing with a system that is voluntarily generated, and here Aristotle's theorem is not applicable. Finally, Crescas suggests that although the earth may be destroyed, since its chemistry implies essential contrariety, it may be that the heavens are incorruptible by virtue of their different nature. This alternative is perhaps the most in accord with the religious tradition of Judaism, although again Crescas is not dogmatic on this matter. Thus, Crescas con- cludes, the "new world" that some of the rabbis speak of as succeeding the present one may be only a new earth, with the heavens abiding.25 V Crescas' tentativeness on this issue is certainly not in evidence when we turn to our last participant in the debate, Don Isaac Abravanel (1437-1509), who in many respects writes the "swan-song" of the Spanish- Jewish school of philosophy. Abravanel vigorously and clearly rejects the strong and moderate versions of the world's indestructibility that we have encountered in Gersonides and Maimonides. Moreover, Crescas' ambiva- lence is removed in favor of an unambiguous and forthright defense of 25. Crescas, Light of the Lord, bk. 6, question 1.</page><page sequence="16">68 SEYMOUR FELDMAN strong destructibility, which frequently relies upon Philoponian themes but expresses them with even greater force. It may be that Abravanel's explicit commitment to strong destructibility was motivated by his fervent messian- ism, which led him to attempt to predict the actual arrrival of the long- awaited "son of David." I shall, however, ignore the eschatological side of Abravanel's thinking, notwithstanding its importance, and focus upon his cosmological arguments for the universe's ultimate "running-down." Like most of his predecessors, Abravanel considers this question from the per- spective of the universe's beginning; indeed, for him creation of the world is the fundamental dogma of Judaism, if Judaism has any specific dogmas at all. Yet, like Saadiah, he also considers the world's temporal end to be a good argument for its temporal beginning; he thus devotes an entire chapter in his main cosmological treatise, Mifalot Elohim ("The Deeds of God"), to the question of the universe's destructibility. Underlying his defense of strong destructibility is a firm commitment to Aristotle's theorem. It is, therefore, ironic, he comments, that those who reject Aristotle's cosmologi- cal conclusions (e.g., Philoponus, Saadiah, and himself) accept his main cosmological theorem, whereas those who defend the universe's everlasting- ness are forced to weaken or reject this principle. Abravanel then proceeds to formulate a series of arguments on behalf of his thesis of strong destruc- tibility.26 As we have seen, one of the more common arguments for the universe's intrinsic destructibility was the contrariety exhibited throughout the material world, including the heavenly domain. Crescas had doubts about the strength of this argument; Abravanel pretty much sidesteps it and emphasizes another Philoponian theme. In fact, Abravanel rejects the Aristotelian principle that contrariety is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for corruption. Even if it were a necessary and sufficient condition for natural corruption, it is not such a condition where voluntary destruc- tion is at issue. Since ex hypothesi the world was voluntarily created, as Maimonides and Gersonides both admit, it can be voluntarily destroyed ex potentia Dei absoluta.27 Second, it is not the case even in natural processes 26. Isaac Abravanel, The Deeds of God [Mifalot Elohim] (Venice, 1592), bk. 8. In my exposi- tion I have not followed the exact sequence of Abravanel's argumentation, but have rearranged his arguments according to the common medieval practice of distinguishing between theologi- cal and scientific arguments for creation or destruction. 27. Abravanel, Deeds of God 4:2, 8:1, 53d-54a. In late Scholastic philosophy the distinction was made between the ordinary, natural course of things originally ordained by God, potentia</page><page sequence="17">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 69 that contrariety itself is the fundamental cause of corruption. The main causes of physical decay are, for Abravanel, the very corporeality and compositeness of a body. All bodies are composites of matter and form, and as such they are susceptible to decomposition. Even Aristotle recognized this point in his analysis of substantial change, wherein prime matter suc- cessively takes on different forms. Each such taking on of a form is, Abra- vanel contends, an instance of corruption, since one form disappears and another takes its place. And this holds true for the heavenly bodies as well. They too are composite entities, having both form and matter. That their matter may differ from terrestrial matter is not as important as the fact that they are material, and as such they can assume different forms.28 Moreover, even if one were to adopt Averroes' doctrine that the heavenly substances are not corporeal, and thus are not composites of form and matter, it would still be true, Abravanel argues, that they are composite; for each one, according to Averroes, consists of "corporeal form" and its "specific form." Now, however this corporeal form is to be understood (Averroes construed it as a tridimensionality), each heavenly entity is a composite substance, and as such is liable to decomposition; for whatever is put together can be torn asunder. So, whether we consider a celestial substance to be a composite of form and matter or a composite of two kinds of form, in either case we have an entity that is intrinsically decomposable and, as such, destructible. Like Philoponus, Abravanel follows Plato in insisting upon the essential corrupti- bility of all corporeal nature, which in turn is based upon their essential compositeness. And this is true even for the heavenly substances.29 It is interesting to note, Abravanel observes, that Aristotle's only argument for the simplicity of the heavens is their alleged incorruptibility. This is clearly a petitio principii. 0 Finally, the circular motions of the heavenly bodies are no Dei ordinata, and His power to suspend this natural order, potentia Dei absoluta (E. Grant, "The Condemnation of 1277, God's Absolute Power and Physical Thought in the Late Middle Ages," Viator 10 [1979]: 211-244). 28. On this point Abravanel sides with Avicenna and Maimonides against Averroes, who follows the Aristotelian interpretation of Themistius, according to which the heavenly bodies are simple substances lacking matter (Wolfson, Crescas' Critique of Aristotle, pp. 103-104, 594-600; Themistius, In de Caelo 14. 13-14 [I owe the reference to Themistius to Richard Sorabji]). 29.

They move circularly simply because of their shape. The elements move rectilinearly only because when not in their proper places they move directly toward them. Another argument frequently adduced from the celestial domain to prove indestructibility was the observed immutability of the heavenly bodies, a "fact" presumably attested to by well-confirmed astronomical data.3' Following the lead of Philoponus, Abravanel rejects this contention. In the first place, destruction is not brought about only by virtue of gradual decay and dissolution, as the Aristotelians and Neo-Plotinians claim. After all, a sculptor can easily take a statue he has made and crush it to smither- eens in just one blow. Some cases of destruction are sudden.32 Since the creationist believes that the generation of the world came about instant- aneously, he believes also that its destruction can take place instantaneous- ly. Second, even if it were the case that corporeal dissolution takes place only gradually, who can be sure that such changes have not occurred or will not occur? Are our observational data always perfect and infallible? Indeed, in the case of the heavenly bodies this observational problem is aggravated by their distances from us. Moreover, the alleged lack of observed variation and change in the heavenly domain may simply be a reflection of the fact that bodies in general differ in their susceptibility to change and in the speed and duration of these changes. Thus, if it is a fact that Mars has not suffered any perceivable change over the last few thousand years, this does not mean that it will not change; it just means that its rate of change is much slower than that of earthly bodies.33 Finally, it could very well be the case that as the world moves toward its dissolution, the signs of its imminent destruction will become more apparent. Nor will these "signs of aging" have to manifest themselves uniformly: it could very well be that the color or thermal proper- ties of a planet will begin to diminish while its velocity remains constant. Time will tell. 31. Philoponus, Contra Aristotelem, as quoted by Simplicius in his In de Caelo 142. 7 ff., and in his In de Physica 332. 15 (S.

Philoponus appeals to the greater bulk of the heavenly bodies to explain their slower rate of change (Philoponus, in Simplicius, In libro de caelo 1:3, p. 142, 11. 7-25; Sambursky, Physical World, pp. 162-165).</page><page sequence="19">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 71 Indeed, Abravanel claims that we can even now see that things are already "running down." People do not live as long as they did in biblical days. Indeed, many of the rabbinic sages lived longer than people now do. Nor is this true only for the human species: other animals too lived longer centuries ago than they do now. The reason for this decline is, Abravanel claims, the general weakening of the elements out of which all bodies are composed. In support of this claim he cities two drugs that were once quite therapeutic but are no longer effective, even though the best pharmacists have compounded them. The first example is the drug made from the peonia flower, which, Abravanel reports, traditionally had been used to treat epilepsy. The second is a drug called theriaca, which the Greeks and Romans used as an antidote for snakebite. Assuming that these drugs are no longer as effective as they used to be, Abravanel maintains that this is so because the various basic elements out of which these drugs are com- pounded have gradually weakened over time. In other words, the progres- sive decay of the world as a whole is rooted in the gradual weakening of the natural elements.34 I now turn to Abravanel's metaphysical, or theological, arguments. As we have noted, since Plato a reason was given both by Platonic philosophers and by religious thinkers for the creation of the universe-God's goodness. But if this is so, Proclus and Gersonides then asked, what could be God's reason for destroying it? Confident that their opponents could not come up with a "sufficient reason," indeed any reason at all, they concluded that the universe must be indestructible. As we have seen, Philoponus tried to answer Proclus' question by giving the same reason for destructibility as for creation-God's goodness. Nevertheless, there is something unsatisfactory about this answer: what is good about destruction, unless, of course, it is an evil that is being destroyed, which does not seem to be the case with the world as a whole? To say that God is the source and criterion of good, so that whatever He does is ipso facto good, is to make God into an arbitrary despot whose will alone decides what is good or evil. And again this did not satisfy later thinkers such as Gersonides, whose God is not so arbitrary as Philoponus'. Nor is Crescas' solution much better. For, if God destroys this world in toto or in parte in order to make a better one, why didn't He make the better 34. Abravanel, Deeds of God 8:2, 54d-55a. Maimonides refers to peonia in Guide 3:37.</page><page sequence="20">72 SEYMOUR FELDMAN one ab initio? Even if it is the case that God did not have to make the best possible world ab initio, there does not seem to be an adequate reason why He should change His mind later, destroy this world, and then make a better one. After all, the Bible does say that after God created the world, He said, "And it was very good" (Gen. 1:31). If God is both omnipotent and omni- benevolent, anything less than the best would be hard to justify. Accord- ingly, Crescas' doctrine, too, does not satisfy Abravanel.35 A sufficient reason for the destruction of the universe must be one that genuinely pro- vides an answer to the question why God will destroy it and at the same time is consistent with good theology. Abravanel contends that even if this universe is destroyed and replaced with another of the same degree of perfec- tion, there could still be a purpose for the destruction: to prove conclusively that God is not identical with the universe, that any universe is not on the same level as God. Just imagine the impression that the sudden disappear- ance of Mars would make on atheiests or pantheists!36 Nor would such a destruction be an evil attributable to God, as Proclus and Gersonides had claimed. Since the destruction of any particular universe has as its purpose knowledge, it cannot be bad. To be kept in ignorance of the true nature of God and the universe is a real evil; to be emancipated from this state is a genuine good. Were the world to continue indefinitely, people might wrongly suppose that the universe is eternal or that it is identical with God. Indeed, God's goodness is expressed in the creation of another universe, which, although having the same level of perfection as the present one, will differ in having, say, eleven planets rotating around the sun. This too is instructive. It teaches that everything in any universe is truly contingent: there are no necessary facts about the world. The laws and facts of each physical system are dependent upon God's will and can be suspended temporarily or annulled altogether and be replaced by a completely different system.37 Nor does the destruction of one universe and the successive creation of another imply any change in God, as Proclus and the Muslim falasifa had continually charged. Each such cosmological event takes place according to a divinely ordained plan, within which each cosmos has a fixed temporal place. As each universe comes into being or passes out of being, nothing 35. Abravanel, Deeds of God, 56d. Sorabji, TCC, pp. 281-282. 36. Abravanel, Deeds of God, 53d-54a. 37. Ibid., 56d-57a.</page><page sequence="21">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 73 really "new" takes place, since each such event has been programmed from eternity. To be sure, there is change insofar as each cosmos suffers destruc- tion; God, however, does not change. Indeed, He is not even the direct agent, or cause, of the destruction, since the world, by virtue of its own inherent nature, inevitably self-destructs. The divine plan determines only its duration. Thus, Abravanel, unlike Maimonides and Gersonides, is quite happy with the rabbinic dictum that God successively builds and destroys universes. Such a view is consistent with both the biblical doctrine of divine omnipotence and Aristotle's theorem that whatever is generated is destroyed.38 After replying to the philosophical arguments for indestructibility, Abravanel now turns to the exegetical argument of Maimonides. In those passages cited by the latter to prove indestructibility, the crucial phrase is le-olam or olam va-ed. Abravanel contends that the word olam does not connote an interminable period of time; rather, this word derives from the root elem, which means "youth." That is, the universe is "young" insofar as it is created. If it were eternal, it would be "old," and a different word for it would be more appropriate. Abravanel, however, admits that the term olam is used in contexts where a long period of time is connoted. But such pas- sages, he claims, do not imply that the period of time is infinite; rather, all they connote is continuous duration until the terminus ad quem is reached. Often the Hebrew term va-ed is added, either before or after olam, to reinforce the idea that such a period of time has a terminus: i.e., the term va-ed means "limit." Accordingly, the phrase olam va-ed does not mean, as Maimonides believed, "unto eternity," but merely "until the end of the world's existence." Indeed, Abravanel concludes, there is no word at all in the Hebrew language that connotes infinite time or duration.39 Actually, Abravanel contends, Scripture and Tradition support the contrary view that the world will be destroyed and replaced by another. Consider Isaiah's statement "For behold! I am creating a new heaven and a new earth: the former things shall not be remembered, they shall never come to mind" (Isa. 65:17). This passage clearly indicates, Abravanel argues, that God will create a new world after the demise of this present universe. This view is supported by the rabbis. In one text they say: "The world remains for 38. Ibid., 56b. 39. Ibid., 61c-62c.</page><page sequence="22">74 SEYMOUR FELDMAN six thousand years, and one thousand years it will be waste."40 Following a well-established rabbinic hermeneutical tradition, Abravanel interprets this passage to mean that this world will endure for six thousand years, since according to rabbinic tradition each day of God constitutes one thousand years. The "six days of creation" therefore indicate that the duration of this world is six thousand years. When it is said, "on the seventh day God finished His work, and He rested on the seventh day" (Gen. 2:2), Scripture is telling us also that the seventh day is the very day of the cessation of the world. The Hebrew word used here, va-yekhal, connotes "destruction" as well as "completion." The term shabat also signifies the "annulment and cessation of this world," indicating that "the world and its fullness belongs to God," such that just as He created it He will destroy it ad libitum, since it is completely like clay in the hand of the potter.41 Abravanel's final argument brings us back to the beginning of my essay. In book 9, chapter 9, he takes up the Philoponus-Kaldm argument for crea- tion from the inherent destructibility of the universe. Although perhaps the most difficult chapter in Abravanel's entire treatise, it gives a valuable summary of the history of the problem and of the various attempts to solve what appears to be a basic contradiction in Aristotle's cosmology: How can a finite body having finite force keep on moving with constant velocity throughout infinite time? Abravanel describes two general methods of reply- ing to Philoponus' argument. On the one hand, there is the approach of Alexander and Avicenna, who claim that the inherently finite and corrupti- ble force of a heavenly body is sustained by some external incorporeal cause that moves the body throughout infinite time. On the other hand, there is the previously mentioned solution of Averroes, who makes two funda- mental distinctions: (1) between the inherent incorruptible nature of the heavenly bodies and their inherent corruptible motion; and (2) between the finite intensive force of such bodies and their infinite extensive force, or duration. On the basis of these distinctions, Averroes replied to Philoponus' argument as follows: this argument would be pertinent only if it were claimed that the existence of the heavenly bodies were contingent per se, not just their motion. But this is, for Averroes, not the case. The only contin- 40. B.T. Rosh Hashanah 31a; Sanhedrin 97a. 41. Abravanel, Deeds of God, 49a-d; Commentary on Genesis (New York, 1959), pp. 33c-34a.

Maimonides, Guide 2:29.</page><page sequence="23">THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 75 gency inherent in the heavenly bodies is their potentiality for change in place, and this kind of contingency is "external," not affecting their very nature. In and of themselves the planets and stars have incorruptible exis- tence, although their motions have to be externally sustained ad infinitum. Once the distinction between the very nature and existence of the heavenly bodies and their motions is recognized, as well as the previously mentioned distinction between their intensive and extensive forces, we can see that the heavenly domain is essentially incorruptible.42 Second, the heavenly bodies are simple bodies, and as such are not subject to corruption and decay, since they lack the causes of corruption due to contrariety and composition. Accordingly, they exist for infinite time; although their motions are finite in velocity, these motions persist throughout infinite time because the bodies themselves have infinite duration.43 Although Abravanel is quite respectful of Averroes' solution and believes that Gersonides' criticisms of it are not successful, he rejects it. In the first place, since ex hypothesi Averroensi a planet is kept moving for infinite time by an external cause, this capacity for motion is infinite, just as the capacity for moving the planet, which is possessed by the motive cause, is infinite. The former power is a passive capacity, whereas the latter is an active capacity. In either case, we have infinite powers; but Aristotle's princi- ples do not allow infinite powers in bodies, whether they be passive or active.44 So Averroes has not really evaded the force of Philoponus' argu- ment. Second, even if it be conceded that the incorporeal mover could have an infinite active power by virtue of which it "moves" its heavenly sphere, which in turn has only an infinite passive power for the reception of move- ment, it has to be conceded that the sphere too would have, ex hypothesi Averroensi, an infinite active power which it exerts upon terrestrial bodies. For example, if the sun is kept moving for infinite time, during which it illuminates the earth, then it has an active power of illumination. But bodies do not have infinite active powers according to Aristotle! Third, the distinc- tion made by Averroes between the finite intensity of a force and its infinite duration requires more defense than he gives. Aristotle himself did not seem to recognize such a distinction. Indeed, Abravanel contends that it is either an ad hoc solution or, worse, a petitio principii. Prima facie it would seem 42.

The picture of a body continuously losing energy but regaining it by virtue of continual transfusions from some external source is surely artificial, especially if this process is to endure forever.45 Finally, the fundamental distinction that Averroes makes between the existence and essence of the heavenly bodies and their motion is arbitrary. Such a distinction implies that the planetary movements are just accidental to the planets; indeed, Averroes' use of the term "external" suggests that their motions have an adventitious character. But this is wrong! It is the very essence of the heavenly bodies to move. There is, then, no real difference between the existence and the movements of the heavenly bodies: if the one is necessary and eternal, so is the other; if the one is contingent and corrupti- ble, so is the other. In this respect the Alexanderian-Avicennian solution is more consistent: it admits that both the nature and the movements of the heavenly bodies are corruptible per se, although eternal per causam. However, since this solution has its problem, as Averroes himself has shown,46 we are better off by simply admitting that sooner or later the very existence of the heavenly bodies will suffer the same fate as do all bodies- decomposition and dissolution. Abravanel concludes his discussion by remarking that Philoponus' argument is in his view "virtually" decisive proof for the creation and destruction of the universe.47 Conclusion Our debate has transcribed a full circle. We began with Saadiah, who advocated the world's destructibility on the basis of a Philoponian argu- ment, and we have ended with Abravanel, who, at the culmination of medieval Jewish philosophy, criticized the various attempts to defend the 45. Abravanel, Deeds of God, 77b. This was one of the criticisms made by Leibniz against Newton. For the latter bodies lose force, which is preserved only by divine intervention (A. Koyr6, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe [Baltimore, 1968], chaps. 11-12). 46. The Alexanderian-Avicennian solution suffers from the same artificiality noted by Abravanel in his criticism of Averroes' theory. 47. Abravanel, Deeds of God, 77c-78a.

Ever since Plato there had been a reluctance on the part of some "creation- ists" to allow for the world's end. On either physical or metaphysical grounds these thinkers wanted to make the universe a "fair image" of its divine maker, and thus claimed that the universe is indestructible. Some- what more consistently their opponents argued that whatever has a begin- ning must have an end, and conversely. Thus, using Aristotle, the paradigm proponent of the world's eternity, the "destructionists" accused their opponents of trying to eat their cake and have it too. If the universe is truly created by God, then God has the power to destroy it: he who makes some- thing can "unmake" it. Moreover, if the universe is a finite physical system, as all our debaters maintain, then as finite it should "run-down." The universe is, as Philoponus had argued, entropic. Thus, both a parte Dei and a parte mundi, the universe is destructible. Rutgers University New Brunswick, N.J.</page></plain_text>
