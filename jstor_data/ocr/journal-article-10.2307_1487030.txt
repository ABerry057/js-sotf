Boulder, Colo.: East European Monographs, 1989. vii, 194 pp. Israel Oppenheim has been a leading student of the Zionist labor move- ment in interwar Poland for some two decades. Indeed, by now there is probably no newspaper, pamphlet, handbill, or collection of unpublished material having some bearing on this subject that he has not examined. His monumental Hebrew study, Tenu'at HefHaluts BeFolin, published in 1982, offered over 600 detailed pages on the nature and origins of the concept of Zionist pioneering and the manner in which various groups sought to imple- ment it from the 1917 founding of the HeHaluts Committee of Congress Poland until the beginning of the Fifth Aliyah in 1929. In contrast, his latest volume, The Struggle of Jewish Youth for Productivization, at once narrows its focus to a single aspect of the story of HeHaluts, and extends the period examined to the outbreak of World War II. It is thus not simply an English condensation of his magnum opus but an entirely new work. The book's subject is hakhsharah, a framework maintained by the Zion- ist movement for providing would-be immigrants to Palestine with the skills that would allow them both to make a living in their new country and to contribute materially to the strengthening of the country's economic infra- structure. Approximately 4,000 people were involved in hakhsharah activi- ties in Poland in 1919; by 1935 the number had grown, with several major fluctuations along the way, to 60,000, before declining by 25 percent annual- ly during the three years prior to the war. One of the book's primary pur-</page><page sequence="2">130 BOOK REVIEWS poses is to explain these periodic changes in the appeal of the idea of a life of labor in Palestine to Jewish young people in interwar Poland. It finds an explanation in the ups and downs of the Polish and Palestinian economies combined with the expansion or contraction of possibilities for gaining entry into Palestine: when times were bad in Poland and opportunities for employment in Palestine plentiful, programs to train Jews for jobs impor- tant to the developing Yishuv were popular, whereas when times in Poland were better, or when the British mandatory authorities restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, Polish Jews did not regard hakhsharah as a realis- tic prospect for improving their situations. There were other changes in the practice of hakhsharah during the inter- war years for which the book endeavors to account. Prior to the mid-1920s, for example, the concept of hakhsharah was understood to imply nothing more than vocational training, with no significant ideological component; hakhsharah programs were based in cities and catered to the needs of indivi- dual, part-time trainees who continued to live with their families. After that time, however, the content of hakhsharah programs came to include strong Hebrew cultural and Zionist ideological educational goals. Moreover, such programs began to be organized along lines parallel to the Palestinian kib- butzim: they were located in the countryside and addressed the trainees as a collective, demanding that they participate in hakhsharah on a full-time, residential basis and that they subordinate every aspect of their lives to the needs of the group. Indeed, during this latter period hakhsharah programs began to call themselves kibbutzim. According to the book, this develop- ment was largely a response to the fact that of the 30,000 Jews who immi- grated to Palestine from Poland during the Fourth Aliyah (1925-26), 80 percent eschewed the life of labor and settled in cities, and a large percentage eventually returned to Poland. Vocational training alone, it appeared, was not sufficient to instill in immigrants the commitment to the ideals of the Zionist movement necessary for them to make a long-term, positive contri- bution to the strengthening of the Yishuv's economic base; hakhsharah pro- grams were called upon to generate that commitment. To the extent that the book points out these changes (and others, includ- ing the spread of the hakhsharah idea to groups that operated outside of the HeHaluts umbrella organization, the differentiation of hakhsharah programs within HeHaluts along ideological lines, and the strengthening of ties between the Polish HeHaluts and the labor movement in Palestine) and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 131 adduces well-documented explanations for them, it makes a valuable con- tribution to the literature on the Jews in interwar Poland. However, the book suggests throughout (even in its title) that "Jewish youth" in Poland found in hakhsharah programs the primary vehicle for carrying out a "strug- gle for productivization" aimed at transforming Polish Jewry as a whole from a people of shopkeepers to a people of laborers. Unfortunately, it does not demonstrate this thesis at all. To be sure, it has become a stylistic con- vention to include the word "struggle" in books about the Jews of interwar Poland (as witnessed by the works of Shlomo Netzer, Emanuel Melzer, and Moshe Landau), but it is difficult to locate that struggle in this volume. The large majority of Jews, not merely Jewish young people, had to struggle to make a living in a Polish economy that was generally weak and in the face of government policies that hit them especially hard; but those who participat- ed in hakhsharah programs were hardly trying to change those conditions for any but themselves. On the contrary, the book makes clear that hakh- sharah's popularity for most of its participants lay in the fact that it offered the best chance of a ticket out of Poland. Nor does it appear that hakhsharah can be regarded as the primary expression of Jewish youth as a whole to "productivize" itself: even at its maximum, the number of hakhsharah par- ticipants represented but a small percentage of Polish Jews between the ages of fourteen and twenty-nine. The book also suffers from some highly obtrusive technical flaws. Its original manuscript was clearly not in English, and it has been translated by someone whose command of that language is far from perfect. In many instances the text can be understood only by translating it back into its pre- sumed Hebrew original (the preface thanks someone "for the translation from the Yiddish," but there is no indication that Yiddish was the language of the entire original text). For example, the expression "to create an the Land of Israel atmosphere there" [sic, p. 45] is probably unintelligible to anyone who cannot hear in it the Hebrew phrase litsor sham 'avirah 'A rtsi- yisra'elit. Indeed, many of the translation's problems stem from the trans- lator's insistence upon rendering 'Erets Yisra'el as "the Land of Israel" in every instance, even when the Hebrew noun is transformed into an adjec- tive. The official English name of the territory known in Hebrew as 'Eretz Yisra'el during the period in question was Palestine, and employing it need not be construed as carrying any ideological implications (especially since, unlike "the Land of Israel," it has an acceptable adjectival form). Moreover,</page><page sequence="4">132 BOOK REVIEWS the problems with the translation are compounded by the fact that the book was published as part of a series noteworthy in general for extremely poor editing. There is virtually no page without a serious editorial shortcoming; the publisher clearly did not give the book the care and attention that it required and deserved. Nevertheless, the book demonstrates once again that Israel Oppenheim has much of importance to say about the history of Polish Jewry and the Zionist movement before World War II. For all of its drawbacks, it is a wel- come contribution. David Engel New York University New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
