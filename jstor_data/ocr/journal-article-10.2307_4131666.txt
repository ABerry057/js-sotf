<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 277-304 COMIC BOOKS, TRAGIC STORIES: WILL EISNER'S AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY by Jeremy Dauber In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in writing by scholars and literary and cultural critics on the genre of the comic book, corresponding to an increased legitimacy given to the comic book industry and its writers and artists more generally.' Part of this phenomenon no doubt stems from the attention lavished on the field by mainstream fiction and nonfiction writers who consider comic books a central part of their own and America's cultural heritage, such as Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem.2 It may also stem from the changing nature of the industry's finances, which now employ a "star system" revolving around writers and artists, not merely the major companies' storied characters; though the days of the big houses that control the major characters are by no means gone, in the last two decades, numerous specialty imprints have been developed to publish characters that are owned outright by writers and artists, to say nothing of profit-sharing deals with major stars, even at some of the major companies.3 1.

Cf. the state of the field in the early 1980s as it is described in Will Eisner, Will Eisner s Shop Talk (Milwaukie, OR: Dark Horse Comics, 2001), 45-50, 295-96 (where it is also linked to 277</page><page sequence="2">Jeremy Dauber Still, writers such as Chabon and Lethem mostly focus on the kind of mass-market superhero comics that have been the inspiration for the mainstream, big-budget movies-characters such as Superman, Batman, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and the like-comics that still constitute the bulk of comic book sales. The fact that an overwhelming majority of the creators of these archetypally American heroes were Jews and often, though not always, first-generation Americans has led to a rapidly expanding corpus of scholarly work linking comic book history and American Jewish communal and cultural history more generally.4 Much of the recent critical excitement, on the other hand, has come not from the classic newsstand comic books but rather from the comic book's full-form version, known as the graphic novel, which is generally published on glossier paper and between harder covers and perhaps best known for its greater degree of literary sophistication and (arguably) aesthetic ambition.5 Certainly, this field has blossomed in recent years not only in objective terms but also in the eyes of the cultural gatekeepers: When graphic novelists such as Daniel Clowes are pro- minently featured on the pages of the New Yorker and Chris Ware has a weekly feature in the New York Times Magazine, then it is clear that what once may have been an underground trend has now emerged firmly into the mainstream.6 Many of the graphic novels that have received the most attention (though not those of Ware and Clowes) focus on issues of history, nationality, and ethnicity, often refracted through a personal lens; this is certainly true of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, which describes the author's experiences growing up in Iran during the Islamic revolution; Joe Sacco's "graphic journalism" covering his time in Gorazde (Safe Haven Gorazde) and the West Bank (Palestine); and, most notable for people in the field of Jewish studies in general and American Jewish writing in particular, the work of Art Spiegelman. Spiegelman's two-volume graphic novel biography of his father's experiences during the Holocaust, Maus (subtitled "My Father Bleeds History"), combines the riveting testimony of a survivor with a second-generation writer's powerful examination of issues of history, memory, and the responsibility and ability of art to capture that historical memory.7 the phenomenon of comic book conventions).

It is less well known that one of the central figures of the comics industry in the United States during its formative "golden age"-and the man generally considered the creator of the "graphic novel" more generally-was also, in the last decades of his life, working increasingly on Jewish themes.8 The year 2005 saw the passing of Will Eisner, and the posthumous release of his final work-The Plot. The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders ofZion- provides a useful opportunity to examine his literary output over the better part of six decades. This article seeks to accomplish three related tasks: first, to give a brief overview of the life and work of a man who was so influential in his field that its highest award is named for him;9 second, to discuss in doing so the particu- lar dynamics of his transformation as a writer as he dealt with issues of auto- biography and Jewish history; and third, to discuss how his particular interests as a graphic artist shaped his themes and ideas and vice versa. Eisner was not only one of the field's practical innovators but also one of its leading theoreticians; his works on what he referred to as "sequential narrative and graphic art" allow us also to interpret his poetics and to see how Eisner's American Jewish history and biography have been essential in shaping not merely a canonical oeuvre but also the contours of a new and rapidly expanding medium.10 I. WILL EISNER: A LIFE11 Eisner was born in the Williamsbridge neighborhood of Brooklyn on March 6, 1917, to Jewish immigrants.12 Growing up in a culture in which children were expected to help support the family, Eisner worked at "a little [news]stand on Wall Street" during the early 1930s; there, he sold comic and cartoon books, 8. That is to say, less well known outside the circles of comics aficionados and critics. See R. C. Harvey, "The Graphic Novel, Will Eisner, and Other Pioneers," pt. 2, Comics Journal, no. 234 (June 2001), 92-97. On his general anonymity and the history of his more recent resurgence, see R.

In doing so, this article will attempt to treat Eisner's works, following his lead, as signifi- cantly different from texts that simply happen to have pictures attached to them. This tendency is all too tempting when discussing such works in forums and with methodologies that are highly attentive to written texts and less so to those texts' surrounding elements. 11. As this article was going to press, the first biography of Will Eisner was published: Bob Andelman, Will Eisner.: A Spirited Life (Milwaukie, OR: M Press, 2005). See also Jones, Men of Tomor- row, 129-30; and the special issue of Comics Journal published in memorial to Will Eisner (no. 267 [April-May 2005], 72-197), which contains a valuable "oral reminiscence" by Eisner, "Will Eisner: Before the Comics" (1, 72-77), as well as numerous other interviews, appreciations, and statements of Eisner's standing in the field by Michael Chabon (89), among others. 12.

His first comic work appeared there-an adventure strip revolving around a hero called The Flame.15 Wow! folded after four issues, and Eisner, seeing the decline of interest in pulp magazines and the increasing interest in cartoons and comic books, formed a partnership with his friend Jerry Iger to produce and deliver complete ready- for-camera comic books for publishers of pulp magazines, a partnership that would become known as the Eisner-Iger Studio.16 The partnership, which lasted until 1939, was notable both for the sheer quantity of material it provided in various genres for different publishers and for the number of notable comics artists who would do some of their early work there, particularly Bob Kane (one of the creators of Batman) and Jack Kirby (responsible in large part for the creation of many of Marvel Comics' most notable superheroes).17 In the early fall of 1939, Eisner was asked by Busy Arnold, the owner of Quality Comics Group, to join them to produce a sixteen-page newspaper supplement to be nationally syndicated in the Sunday editions of major newspapers-which had never been done before-in an attempt to appeal to younger readers who were increasingly abandoning newspapers for comic books.'8 After some negotiation over the terms of the copyright, Eisner agreed 13. "I was getting 3.50 a week from running that stand, and that was big money in 1934" (Eisner, Shop Talk, 106, 194-96). Eisner points out that in the 1940s, newsstands and candy stores were the only real outlets for comic books (Eisner, Shop Talk, 54, 67, 285). 14.

For an interview with Eisner about the process, see R. C. Harvey, "Shop System: Interview with Will Eisner," Comics Journal, no. 249 (December 2002), 62-69. At some point, the partnership also created the Universal Phoenix Syndicate, and Iger and Eisner were briefly involved in producing and selling strips to weekly newspapers as well. See Jones, Men of Tomorrow, 137-40; Eisner, Shop Talk, 53, 154-56, 205; and Harvey, "Shop System," 64. Eisner treats this experience at some (fictiona- lized) length in his graphic novel The Dreamer (New York: DC Comics Printing 2000), in which Eisner and Iger become "Eyron and Samson" (12). 17.

Writing in 2000, he claimed that by 1939, he had been long convinced that [he] was involved with a medium that had real "literary potential." I had decided to spend my life at this, but I was trapped in what to me was a comic-book ghetto where I would be turning out the same sort of formula adventure stories for the same level of reader indefinitely. Newspaper syndication would give me an adult audience and the opportunity to write and draw more sophisticated material.21 Eisner (at least in the early years) wrote and drew the Spirit feature largely himself, and there was certainly much truth to his later claims.22 The strip quickly became known for its innovative, cinematic visuals-especially noteworthy were the inno- vations of the constantly changing rendering of the words "The Spirit" on the splash page23-and its different type of storytelling, the part of the graphic novel that Eisner always claimed he was most interested in.24 For example, one early Spirit story is told entirely in rhyme,25 and another story about spies and foreign agents is apparently invented by a comic book-reading child in lieu of 19. Compare Eisner's own account of this experience in "The Spirit: How It Came to Be," in Spirit Archives 1:7-10, as well as a similar account in Eisner, Shop Talk, 155, which describes Iger's agreement to buy out Eisner as contingent on Eisner's not "raiding" his former shop. See also Jones, Men of Tomorrow, 194-95. 20. See Sabin, Adult Comics, 148; and Comics Journal, no. 210 (February 1999), 83, which places The Spirit at number 15 of its 100 most influential comics of the twentieth century. The other two featured characters were the costumed heroine Lady Luck and the magician Mr. Mystic, worked on by Chuck Mazouijan and Bob Powell, respectively (Spirit Archives, 1:8). On Eisner's deal, which-rare for the time-gave him ownership of the strip and designated him a publisher, see Eisner, Shop Talk, 155.

The "splash page" is the full-page introduction to the story-generally, though not always, the first page of the comic book. Eisner has said that the splash page, for him, is where "the mood and form contact" is set with the reader; see Spirit Archives, 1:17; and Will Eisner, Comics and Sequential Art.: Principles and Practice of the World's Most Popular Art Form, expanded ed. (Tamarac, FL: Poor- house Press, 1990), 62. 24. Eisner refers to this approach as "total story," which he dates from this period of work on The Spirit; see Eisner, Shop Talk, 170, 241. 25.

That said, there were significant continuities between Eisner's new hero and the other characters populating the comic books of the time. The Spirit had a superhero name, he wore a mask, and the feature's standard introduction smacked of the breathless comic book tone: "Known only to Commissioner Dolan, the famous Spirit, greatest new foe of crime, is in reality Denny Colt, believed dead and buried in Wildwood Cemetery. Operating from a hide-out built in the very tomb in which he had been erroneously buried, the Spirit wages a one man secret operation against crime."27 Eisner later claimed that these were necessary concessions to the publishers and to the audience; still, The Spirit, innovative as it was, would not be Eisner's revolutionary contribution to the form or even the content of the medium, though it hinted at what was to come later. Eisner was drafted in 1942; during the war, he worked as a cartoonist for the army, producing posters, illustrations, and strips for the troops, both for educational and entertainment purposes.28 The Spirit section continued while Eisner was in the army, but its quality declined; Eisner returned to The Spirit in 1945 and continued installments until 1952, aided by artists such as Wally Wood and a young Jules Feiffer, who arrived in 1947. The postwar period saw significantly more formal and generic experimentation: The Spirit ventured into science fiction, for example; one story was done in verse, another entirely in pantomime.29 Eisner was even willing to have the title character "easily step aside when the story I was telling didn't need him" and pegged many of the stories to current events-hallmarks of later graphic novels without recognizable heroes that commented on contemporary issues.30 Ultimately, however, the rising cost of newsprint, which drastically increased the price of Eisner's sixteen-page ready-print insert, coincided with a decreasing interest in comic strips on the part of newspapers, causing financial problems.31 Eisner's entrepreneurial talent led him, accordingly, in a different direction: He founded the American Visuals Corporation, which was "a commer- cial art company dedicated to creating comics, cartoons, and illustrations for 26.

While Eisner was in the army, the art was done by Lou Fine and the scripts were written by Manly Wade Wellman and Dick French, among others. Jack Cole (the noted creator of Plastic Man) also did several strips; see Spirit Archives, 1:9. There was also a Spirit daily strip published between 1941 and 1944 (on which, esp.

Eisner soon abandoned The Spirit for this more financially remunerative work, a state of affairs that lasted until the late 1970s.33 The 1970s saw a greater degree of social commitment and engagement among comic book artists, many of whom had, in Eisner's words, "grown up reading comics as a literary staple" and had accordingly "become articulate."34 Notably, both DC and Marvel, the two main comic book publishers, were willing to buck the Comics Code Authority, the self-created censorship organiz- ation founded in the aftermath of the 1950s congressional hearings about comics' moral turpitude, to feature fairly frank and open discussions of drug addiction, problems of the inner city, racism, and other contemporary social issues in their superhero titles.35 Perhaps influenced by these trends, and certainly encouraged by a renewed interest in his work in the late 1960s and 1970s, Eisner was interested in producing more material that would reflect his sense of the medium's possibilities while transcending the limitations of the superhero or adventure form more generally.36 Eisner described his "core concept" as the fact "that the medium, the arrangement of words and pictures in a sequence- was an art form in itself. Unique, with a structure and gestalt all its own, this medium could deal with meaningful themes."37 32. On this period, see Harvey, "The Graphic Novel, Will Eisner, and Other Pioneers," 234. 33.

Eisner has written that "[b]etween 1940 and the early sixties the industry commonly accepted the profile of the comic book reader as that of a '10-year-old from Iowa.' In adults the reading of comic books was regarded as a sign of low intelligence. Publishers neither encouraged nor supported anything more" (Comics and Sequential Art, 141).

Crumb, and Harvey Pekar, see Finkelshteyn, "A Graphic Coming of Age," 43-44; and Patrick Rosenkranz, Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975 (Seattle, WA: Fantagraphics, 2002). 35.

This resurgence of interest stemmed partially from the reprint of some of the Spirit stories in digest form by Harvey Comics and in the Real Free Press by Dutch editor Olaf Stoop; see Alan Moore, "The Pioneering Spirit"; Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1 (New York: DC Comics, 2000), 11-13; and Fiore, "The Cult of Will," 183. 37.

The preface was first written in 1978. 283</page><page sequence="8">Jeremy Dauber The result was four stories that Eisner would refer to as "sequential art," which became the volume A Contract with God and Other Stories.38 After diffi- culties finding a publisher-Eisner said that "getting A Contract with God pub- lished was a very agonizing experience....It took me a year and a half to produce and a year to find a publisher reaching the mass market. I finally had it published by a smaller company. No big publisher would touch it"-the work, generally considered to be the first graphic novel, was published by Baronet Press in 1978.39 The work, which is set in and around the New York tenements of Eisner's own childhood, also marked an interest in Eisner's own autobiography, an interest that is further explored in his subsequent works The Dreamer and To the Heart of the Storm, and an interest in Jewish history and culture more broadly, seen most powerfully in Fagin the Jew and The Plot. These works will be discussed in more detail later. Eisner's return to "sequential art" was accompanied by his increasing stature as a teacher and theoretician of the medium. He began to teach cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York, and he adapted his lectures into two highly influential books, Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Graphic Storytelling and J~isual Narrative (1996). Perhaps the most important expositor of the way comic books work, Scott McCloud, has argued that Eisner's Comics and Sequen- tial Art is the only useful previous effort to understand this powerful and popular medium (his own work aside, understandably)-a sentiment echoed by the most famous practitioners in the field, figures such as Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller.40 Eisner's theoretical work was also designed, polemically, to show the literary potential of this generally underappreciated medium.41 38. See Eisner, Shop Talk, 67, in which Eisner directly references the term: "I guess I have a somewhat pretentious view of the medium we work in. I regard it as kind of a literary form. A language composed of text (words) and visuals (imagery) that's gradually becoming more and more recognized as valid. I call it sequential art, for want of a better word." Eisner's definition of "sequential art" is further developed by Scott McCloud; see McCloud, Understanding Comics, 5. 39. Ibid., 259. That said, as many writers about comics have pointed out, it is technically diffi- cult to refer to this as a "novel" because it is composed of four linked stories. See Bill Sherman, "Return to Dropsie Avenue," Comics Journal, no. 267 (April-May 2005), 92-93, for a clear-eyed look at the nomenclatural circumstances surrounding A Contract with God. 40. On a number of occasions, McCloud refers to Eisner's book Comics and Sequential Art as the only work extant to teach "difficult principles of comics composition and storytelling" (Under- standing Comics, 175). Eisner is also presented as one of the few "great storytellers, creators who have something to say through comics and devote all their energies to controlling their medium, refin- ing its ability to convey messages effectively" (180). For more on Eisner's instructional works, see Rich Kreiner, "Comics and the Man," Comics Journal, no. 267 (April-May 2005), 188-90. 41. For example, Eisner wrote, "In our culture, film and comics are the major conveyors of story through imagery, Each employ arranged graphics and text or dialogue. While film and theater have long ago established their credentials, comics still struggle for acceptance, and the art form, after more than ninety years of popular use, is still regarded as a problematic literary vehicle" (Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative, 3). However, Eisner's polemic argument for comics- that they fill "a gap between print and film" resulting from the fact that "reading in the pure literary sense was mugged on its way to the 21st century" (Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative, 5) may be a bit overstated. See Carrier, The Aesthetics of Comics, 109-10; and Amy E. Spaulding, 284</page><page sequence="9">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History Eisner continued to work steadily and prolifically during this second period, turning out numerous graphic novels and graphic adaptations of classic works of literature such as Moby Dick, Don Quixote (under the title The Last Knight), and The Princess and the Frog. He died on January 3, 2005, following quadruple bypass surgery. II. EISNER'S JEWISH WORK: AUTOBIOGRAPHIES As mentioned previously, Eisner is known in the field of comics for two fairly distinct achievements: his creation of the Spirit, a groundbreaking adventure hero (but an adventure hero nonetheless), and his invention of the graphic novel, in which he felt freer to explore the literary and autobiographical potential that he had always claimed lay within the "sequential art" form. Eisner said that he found expressing his personal opinions in A Contract with God "very, very hard to do, because all my early years I was hiding behind a guy with a mask. I always did speak candidly about my opinions on life, but never about me."42 This distinction can be seen clearly in Eisner's treatment of one of the most pressing issues facing America and the American Jewish community during the first run of The Spirit: America's attitude toward Nazi Germany before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Eisner characterized his Tudor City studio in 1940 and 1941 as full of "political and philosophical... conversations [that] reflected the times,"43 and it would be surprising indeed if Eisner's and many of his fellow artists' Jewishness failed to inform their thoughts and conversations, particularly given Eisner's identity as the son of eastern European immigrants. It may not be surprising, then, to see how quickly and frequently Eisner and his most popular character began to express, first guardedly and then openly, anti- Nazi and prowar sentiments.

America!"46 Though in the early period, Eisner has tyrannical forces menace invented places such as Slavia and Barovia, perhaps because of a general reticence by editors and publishers to directly court controversy,47 as the war approached, the Spirit strips display greater reality and specificity.48 In May 1941, we see a Hitleresque figure named "King Kohl" who attempts to take over the world and mentions Hitler by name for the first time in the series.49 Just over a month later, a remarkable story, "The Tale of the Dictator's Reform,"so in which "a cruel dictator"--never named but who looks precisely like Hitler (and, we are informed in the story, "any similarity to persons living or dead is entirely intentional")-slips into America and suffers a complete failure trying to convince Americans of his cause, largely because of the country's innate patriotism and unwillingness to be divided against itself.5' Meeting with the Spirit, he decides to reform his and his country's ways; upon returning home, however, he is killed by his staff and replaced with a double. As the country approached the war, Eisner's active militation against the Nazis grew greater-The Spirit took on fifth columnists, saboteurs on American soil, and foreign spies.52 Nonetheless, following the general tendency of many comic book artists at the time, either to maximally expanding their American (and indeed Christian) 46.

In the newspaper photos you always appear taller! !") and a former corporal with delusions of militaristic grandeur. In the story, he is beaten up, shoved out of a subway car, socked in the face, thrown into a ditch, kicked in the shins by a little boy-in short, "beaten and bewildered" by the fact that there are "a thousand different dissatisfied groups in this country... yet each is just as patriotic as the other" (Spirit Archives, 1:203). 52.

Doing so, of course, was also a far more effective propagandist tack to drum up American support for the war than if the Spirit had been seen as supporting a par- ticular "Jewish" cause. Nonetheless, a current reader of the strips is struck by the way in which Jewish matters of the moment lie strongly-but subtly--below the surface. Michael Chabon captures a similar dynamic in his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, in which the eastern European 6migr6 and comic book artist Joe Kavalier wants to explicitly fight Hitler from the earliest days of the European war and is forced to capitulate to pressure on the part of his editors and publishers.54 Thirty-five years later, Eisner's developing perspective on not only the nature of the medium but also the kinds of stories that the medium could tell is evident. In his discussions about the medium, he refers to the graphic novel as "a form capable of dealing with much more sophisticated themes than are being dealt with now" and "a means, not an end."55 Eisner's innovation in A Contract with God was to recreate the medium of the graphic novel as both a genre suited to autobiographical expression and, perhaps because of the added degree of mimetic possibility stemming from the combination of typographical and visual representation, to ethnographic exploration. Eisner writes in his preface to A Contract with God, In this book, I have attempted to create a narrative that deals with intimate themes. In the four stories, housed in a tenement, I undertook to draw on memory culled from my own experiences and that of my contemporaries. I tried to tell how it was in a comer of America that is still to be revisited.56 Eisner's explanation contains the somewhat contradictory implications of any autobiographer or life writer, particularly one with an explicit polemic purpose: on the one hand, his desire to present the graphic novel as a fitting medium for the presentation of the personal requires the creation of intimacy; on the other, as in the case of The Spirit, the desire for popular appeal (here not only on behalf of his own work but on behalf of the form itself), which yields to an argument concerning the product's ethnographic value-not merely as an end in itself but as an attempt to truthfully portray an ethnic group as an essential 53. There is one clear reference to Jesus in one of the early stories-"But that's the way of life.... about two thousand years ago, a humble man died on a cross for the sake of people he would never live to know" (Spirit Archives, 2:69)-and Spirit Christmas stories (about, sensibly enough, the "spirit of Christmas") were a fairly regular feature. 54.

This is hardly an uncom- mon strategy among early American Jewish writers, reminding us to contextualize Eisner's graphic novel work as deeply continuous with that of his generational peers, produced in the late 1930s, not the late 1970s.57 Though other scholars have addressed the tensions between personal revel- ation, polemic, and ethnography in American Jewish autobiography and Jewish life writing more generally,58 the addition of the graphic element, and particularly Eisner's own highly theorized approach to his medium, demands an analysis that incorporates both the visual and textual aspects of the work. Eisner also writes in his preface to A Contract with God, [I]n the telling of these stories, I tried to adhere to a rule of realism which requires that caricature or exaggeration accept the limitations of actuality. To accomplish a sense of dimension, I set aside two basic working constric- tions that so often inhibit the medium-space and format. Accordingly, each story was written without regard to space, and each was allowed to develop its format from itself; that is, to evolve from the narration. The normal frames (or panels) associated with sequential (comic book) art are allowed to take on their integrity. For example, in many cases an entire page is set out as a panel.59 Some of Eisner's experimentation with breaking away from the panel form certainly stemmed from his training at the Eisner-Iger Studio, where he trans- formed newspaper comic strips into full-fledged comic books and developed the splash page into a high-water mark of mid-twentieth-century comic art.60 57. Furthermore, it may suggest a certain support for evolutionary approaches to particular lit- erary subgenres, suggesting a preference for a return to earlier models of content while innovating new approaches of form. This idea, however, is beyond the scope of the present essay. 58. The literature on Jewish autobiography in general, and American Jewish autobiography more particularly, is large. For some important treatments that also grapple with the voluminous theor- etical literature on the subject, see two special issues of Prooftexts dedicated to Jewish American auto- biography, Prooftexts 18, no. 2-3 (May-September 1998); and a special issue on autobiography in Jewish Quarterly Review 95, no. 1 (Winter 2005), esp. Marcus Moseley, "Jewish Autobiography: The Elusive Subject," 16-59. 59. Eisner, A Contract with God, ii. Eisner dedicates a good bit of his theoretical writing to the question of panels, which he still regards as the essential unit of storytelling in sequential art. McCloud, following Eisner, writes that "the panel itself [is] overlooked as comics' most important icon!... The panel acts as a sort of general indicator that time or space is being divided. The durations of that time and the dimensions of that space are defined more by the contents of the panel than by the panel itself' (McCloud, Understanding Comics, 98-99). Eisner writes that "each panel should be regarded as a stage wherein an arrangement of elements takes place. They must be arranged with a clear purpose. Nothing in a panel or page should be accidental or placed there casually" (Graphic Story- telling and Visual Narrative, 151) and that "the panel... is used by the artist to capture or 'freeze' one segment in what is in reality an uninterrupted flow of action. To be sure, this segmentation is an arbi- trary act-and it is in this encapsulation that the artist employs the skill of narration" (Comics and Sequential Art, 39).

Harvey, "The Graphic Novel, Will Eisner, and Other Pioneers." 288</page><page sequence="13">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History But arguably, Eisner's innovation was not merely related to technical reevaluation or to The Spirit. Denny O'Neil, himself a major creative force in comics, argues, The Bronx of A Contract with God is much less precisely rendered than the Central City of The Spirit, and that is surely a conscious decision of a thinking artist intent on introducing us to his most private, interior experience instead of reproducing the world as most of us see it. Eisner even puts the ink the book is printed in to his artistic uses: it is sepia brown, a close approximation of the monochrome psychologists say is the color of dreams-and memories.61 O'Neil's instructive comments invite us once more to view Eisner's graphic art (and, arguably, the art of any graphic novel composed by the writer) as a further step toward unmediated autobiographical intimacy, and this is unquestion- ably true. But just as all autobiographical writing stems from the nexus between personality and cultural and historical context, we may be able to speak more broadly as well to Eisner's "American Jewish" graphic artistry. Eisner said that he believed "geographic origin impinges on style of art considerably," and one may therefore venture some comments about Eisner's linkage of new theme and a new form.62 Eisner uses A Contract with God to tell stories of the immigrant and first- generation American Jewish urban experience, particularly in the tenements of the Bronx. Eisner writes more abstractly about cities and their relationship to his art in his collections City People Notebook and Will Eisner 's New York: The Big City.63 In those works, he notes that "life deep in a big city affects the basic sensibilities and influences the character of one's conduct in a way that affirms environment's triumph over all of us," particularly along the perceptual and cognitive axes of time, smell, and space, which he terms "the most influential and pervasive environmental phenomena."64 Though much can be said about the first two categories, this essay will focus primarily on his treatment of space. In these notebooks and sketchbooks, Eisner's dissolution of the traditional panel structure is frequently apparent; large open spaces are often used to accentuate feelings of alienation and unease rather than a sense of possibility.65 But the over- whelming picture of Eisner's city is that of density and crowding, which allows both the graphic novelist's eye to catch telling and thus literary details, as well as to generate the kinds of encounters that lead to worthwhile stories.66 In the 61.

But I also know many other big cities, 289</page><page sequence="14">Jeremy Dauber more narratively developed A Contract with God, it becomes clear that there is some thematic connection for the constriction of space faced by the denizens of Eisner's tenements and the constrictions placed on Eisner's art by the conventions of the newspaper comic strip and the comic book-that in telling the stories of these individuals, he is able to provide them with the freedom in their represen- tation that they could not get in their lives. Eisner writes in his preface,67 It is important to understand the times and the place in which these stories were set. Fundamentally, they were not unlike the way the world of today is for those who live in crowded proximity and in depersonalized housing. The importance of dealing with the ebb and flow of city existence and the overriding effort to escape it never seems to change for the inhabitants.68 Indeed, the stories that make up A Contract with God are tales of how attempts at liberation are merely prescriptions for another kind of bondage. In the title story, Frimme Hersh has escaped eastern Europe, which is presented in the story as simply a source of constant and near-annihilatory antisemitic attacks, because of his virtue and his ability to make a contract with God, which he writes on a stone: the confine- ment of virtue for happiness. This happiness is made manifest in the form of an adopted daughter, Rechele, a foundling whom he raises as his own. When Rechele dies of a sudden illness, Frimme Hersh declares himself free of the contract and transforms himself from a pious Hasid into a stereotypical slumlord, complete with shaven beard and Gentile mistress. Eventually, he seeks a kind of return; perhaps spurred by his mistress's offer to convert to Judaism, he goes to the syna- gogue where he used to work and asks the rabbis there to draw up a new contract with God. After some time, they agree, saying, "is not all religion a contract between man and God... he is asking us to provide him with a guiding document so that he might live in harmony with God... can we truly deny him this?"69 They do so, and as he studies the contract later that night, happy to retum to his former life, he dies suddenly of a heart attack. Eisner writes, At the exact moment of Hersh's last earthly breath... a mighty bolt of light- ning struck the city... Not a drop of rain fell... only an angry wind swirled and what I show is meant to be common to them all" and that a "characterization of deep city life is the frequency and inevitability of collisions... space vs. pace. This creates an uncertainty in the trajectory of human motion. Clearly, collisions deflect the flow of life and alter destinies... right?" See Eisner, New York: The Big City, 5; and City People Notebook, 67. 67. Note Eisner's comments on the comic page unbroken by panels: "The non-frame speaks to unlimited space. It has the effect of encompassing unseen but acknowledged background... The frame's shape (or absence of one) can become part of the story itself. It can be used to convey something of the dimension of sound and emotional climate in which the action occurs, as well as contributing to the atmosphere of the page as a whole" (Comics and Sequential Art, 45-46). 68. Eisner, A Contract with God, ii. 69. Ibid., 52. 290</page><page sequence="15">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History about the tenements. On Dropsie Avenue the old tenements seemed to tremble in the storm. It reminded the tenements of that day, years ago, when Frimme Hersh argued with God and terminated their contract.70 In an epilogue, another new arrival finds the stone on which Frimme Hersh wrote his original contract and, knowing nothing of the transpiring intervening events, signs it as well. Thus, someone else's own contractual obligations with God begin. Naturally, Eisner references larger theological issues, as well as previous literary treatments of those issues: Frimme Hersh's insistence on that the rabbis create a contract with God recalls the hasidic tales surrounding Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev, for example.71 But one of Eisner's main arguments seems to be that no one is ever really free-or, for that matter, ever really happy. God seems to provide despair, at least existentially speaking, when one violates the con- tract and agony when one maintains it. Liberation is at best a matter of perspective. In telling this story, then, Eisner is also creating a metaphor of American Jewish exist- ence and the questions of violating tradition as well as maintaining it, both speaking to his own autobiographical experiences and creating an ethnic-national narrative. But Eisner is an artist as well, one who believes strongly in art's ability to establish and support thematic positions articulated by the writer (particularly when the writer and artist are the same).72 As a result, it is surely intentional that A Contract with God's visual presentation constantly evokes a sense of claus- trophobia. Characters are constantly viewed through doorframes, window sills, and a curtain of rain that threatens, Noah-like, to engulf everything. Though the melodramatic aspects of the presentation of the story certainly lend credence to a reading of the presentation as Eisner's willingness to show off his love of storm and stress-to say nothing of tipping his hat to the pathetic fallacy-it may be possible to suggest that the visuals here once more serve to demonstrate the way in which confinement is a major theme in Eisner's work, one that allows him to define: to define Jews as a particular kind of people, to define his memories in a kind of specific context. This, then, is one kind of tragic Jewish story that Eisner collocates with American Jewish history: tenement life as a place of dreams often denied, prom- ises broken, and pain, suffering, and poverty triumphant.73 It is a mood that 70. Ibid., 57-58. 71. See, for example, the tale titled "The Deal" in Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim (New York: Schocken Books, 1991), 1:209-10. 72. Eisner felt very strongly about this unity of writer and artist and reiterated this position many times in his work. In his strongest statement, he wrote, "The ideal writing process occurs where the writer and the artist are the same person. This, in effect, shortens the distance between the idea and its translation. It produces a product that more closely reflects the intent of the writer" (Graphic Story- telling and Visual Narrative, 111). For Eisner, this even extended to the lettering of the captions, a rare position in the business; see Eisner, Shop Talk, 87. Given Eisner's own sense of himself as a writer first, however, he recognizes the primacy of the writing (Comics and Sequential Art, 127). 73. Eisner moves in an equally divergent direction--perhaps even more consciously so--in another of the stories in A Contract with God, "The Super." In the story, the non-Jewish superintendent of a tenement is sexually aroused by a young child, who then uses that desire to steal the super's money, 291</page><page sequence="16">Jeremy Dauber pervades many of Eisner's autobiographical or quasi-autobiographical works; though a full discussion must await further study, suffice it to say that works about his neighborhood are often imbued with this sense of negativity or despair. For example, The Neighborhood: Dropsie Avenue (1995), a history of one Bronx neighborhood's rise, decline, and potential rise once more, told through the interwoven stories of its denizens, is a story told almost entirely through lurid tones and depictions.74 From the very beginning, the avenue's story is built on a horrific accidental death in grand guignol style: A child is acci- dentally burnt to death, a fate that will echo in the final dynamiting of the avenue's last tenement with a legless Vietnam veteran turned drug dealer inside it. The avenue's history, in Eisner's retelling, is filled with horrors, from corruption to gang violence to prostitution to drugs to inter-ethnic strife to the Prohibition equiv- alent of a drive-by shooting.75 This is not to say that Eisner, a witness to life's disappointments and his tra- ditional neighborhood's decline, is unrelentingly nihilist or negative. Like many who lived through the Great Depression, Eisner is struck by the tenacity of the American community-and particularly the immigrant American Jewish commu- nity-to continue on in the face of manifold obstacles and massive suffering. In his account of the Great Depression years in the Bronx, A Life Force (first published in sections in the 1980s and 1990s), Eisner constantly compares the tenement dwell- ers, who "remained holding fast to their beachhead simply because they had only just arrived from other, more hostile places [and] carried with them the tabemacle of a life force they hardly understood" to the cockroaches that infest their tene- ments.76 In chapters such as "Izzy the Cockroach and the Meaning of Life," the poison his beloved dog, and then threaten to blackmail him with a child abuse charge, leading him to shoot himself. Showing how the complex strains of sexuality can unman even the frightening figure of the non-Jew and the man who controls the tenement (for it is the super who makes the heat go properly, which has thematic and metaphorical functions as well as actual ones), "The Super" is disturbing and adult on many levels. Most intriguingly, though, it serves as an ironic comment on Eisner's previous work; the splash page, on which "The Super" is written in large, bricklike letters, is highly reminiscent of Eisner's famed splash pages for The Spirit, and we are certainly meant to reflect on precisely how unsuper this super is-both in terms of his moral failings and his depiction as very different from anything Eisner worked on in his superhero days. 74. Will Eisner, The Neighborhood: Dropsie Avenue (New York: DC Comics, 1995). 75. In another graphic novel, Eisner provides a much broader sweep of the history of the area and the Jewish community that goes with it. In The Name of the Game (New York: DC Comics, 2001), the game in question is marriage, and it serves as a means of social and economic advancement or decline. Eisner uses the example of the Arnheim family, who "by 1890 were a leading family in the dominant East Coast German Jewish social establishment" (3), to show how the increasing success of American German Jewry became tied to an increasing snobbery and social consciousness that was divorced from ethical concerns. While the family's patriarch, Isidore, harps constantly on their family name, saying that it "means something... if you protect it, it will protect you" (9), his wife's insistence on their son Conrad's entrance into the family business and on a "good marriage" to a daugh- ter of a wealthy family with social ambitions leads to disaster for the family members and their firm. All sorts of destructive acts, not limited to rape, abuse, madness, and alcoholism, ensue. 76. Will Eisner, A Life Force (New York: DC Comics, 2001). 292</page><page sequence="17">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History graphic novel's main protagonist, Jacob Shtarkah (Yiddish for "strong man"), wonders in the course of his hard, unrecompensed life and his unhappy marriage whether there is anything to life in the Great Depression beyond sheer animal survival.77 In Shtarkah's soliloquies on seeing a cockroach clinging to life, Eisner further develops his philosophical approach to the relation between man and God: Well, there are only two possibilities! Either, man created God... or, God created man! If...man created God... then, the reason for life is only in the mind of man!! If, on the other hand, God created man, then the reason for living is still only a guess! ... After all is said and done, who really knows the will of God?... So, in either case, both man and cockroach are in serious trouble. Because staying alive seems to be the only thing on which everybody agrees!78 By the end of A Life Force, though, things have changed just enough to suggest that the possibility of dreaming of a better life-even if one's particular dreams have been crushed-constitutes proof of the actual existence of different, improved circumstances. In a section titled "Sanctuary," Shtarkah reconnects with Frieda, a former flame from Germany who has desperately written him for assist- ance as the Nazi noose tightens.79 When she eventually comes to America, Shtarkah considers leaving his wife for her, saying that he does not want to be a cockroach, that "[flor 30 years I ate, slept, and nailed wood ... all the time locked up inside of me was the dream of what might have been!"80 Given the pre- vious discussion of Eisner's foregrounding of issues of liberation and bondage, Eisner's recasting of domestic unhappiness as a kind of prison-and dreams of romance as a mark of liberation-is highly significant. Though Frieda eventually chooses not to continue her relationship with Shtarkah, the latter is told by a rabbi that he can thank God nonetheless.8' Eisner's visual portrayal of Rabbi Bersohn on his first appearance, backlit with holy light, suggests we are to view him positively and perhaps even acknowledge the possibility of spiritual transcendence in a world that relentlessly and ruth- lessly suggests its futility in the face of socioeconomic facts.82 This spiritual 77. With respect to Eisner's relationship to Yiddish, see his added note in the third printing of A Contract with God, in which he notes that that work had been translated into Yiddish-"a language in which I can think but cannot read or write" (A Contract with God, iii). 78.

Shtarkah continually casts this in relation to the cockroach metaphor; see esp. 103. 81. Ibid., 133ff. 82. Ibid., 31. Eisner explores this approach in more detail in Minor Miracles (New York: DC Comics, 2000), in which he links autobiography and national history--a strategy we will see further developed in Eisner's work throughout this essay. Eisner writes that "the stories in this work resemble the stories my parents referred to as 'meinsas' [sic, mayses]." His interest in them stems not only from their narrative interest but also from the fact that miracles and miracle stories "are a sort of cultural 293</page><page sequence="18">Jeremy Dauber transcendence, however, is found not only (or even primarily) in traditional religion but rather in artistic and creative endeavors. Shtarkah says early in the graphic novel, when he loses his artisan's job, "It wasn't just a living ... I was making something! A reason for living! ... Otherwise, how is a man different from a cockroach?"83 Later, when he gets another job, he wryly remarks, "So ... if surviving is poetry ... nu, I'll be a poet!"84 For Eisner, it is the dreaming of romance, not the romance itself, that matters: It is not for nothing that Eisner gives one of his most straightforwardly autobiographical and most optimistic graphic novels-a thinly disguised account of his own upward move from the tene- ments to the successful comic book business-the title The Dreamer.85 Eisner's own life story is, for him, proof of the potentially happy ending of the American Jewish story. In Eisner's final and most extensive autobiographical work, however, he more fully broaches another tragic aspect of that story, which leads to the topic that would suffuse his work for the last period of life: the history of antisemitism. Though Eisner begins his treatment of this subject autobiographically, we will see how his broader treatment of the subject is essentially that of a graphic novelist rather than a novelist. Eisner's autobiographical preface in To the Heart of the Storm illustrates his shift in emphasis: I grew up in the safety of America during the brewing of the storm that culminated in World War II. It was a voyage through a time of social awaken- ings and pervading concern with economic survival. At the same time, one could hear the rumblings and feel the shock waves from the distant Holocaust. When I began work on this book, I intended to deliver a narrowly focused fictional experience of that climate, but in the end it metamorphosed into a inheritance... [which] recur from generation to generation" and that the older generations' propensity to explain any unexplainable story leads to the widespread acceptance of miracles (Minor Miracles, 1-2). Among the stories in the graphic anthology are "Street Magic" (Minor Miracles, 19-26), in which we see how immigrant families, who believed "they were in hostile territory," used old-country survival skills as "magic spells... when dealing with the predictable outrages of neighborhood life" (19); the story presents the ability to come to an ingenious solution to outwit hostile Gentiles who intend harm as a kind of magical grace from above. Conversely, in stories such as "A New Kid on the Block" (Minor Miracles, 27-72) and "A Very Special Wedding Ring" (Minor Miracles, 73-110), forces that seem to appear mysteriously (the eponymous young boy and ring) have the effect of chan- ging the mood and morale of the entire neighborhood, suffusing them with hope and joy in inexplicable ways. Though these effects are not precisely Jewish or even theological, there is nonetheless a spiritual effect. And when these transcendent entities depart, things return to their normal state: "[T]he block seemed to have lost something... old tensions and conflicts resumed" (70). There can be no clearer way of seeing Eisner's complex balance of optimism and skeptical realism, seen through his portrayals of spiritual transcendence and ordinary life. 83. Ibid., 11. 84.

In such a work, fact and fiction become blended with selective recall and result in a special reality. I came to rely on the truthfulness of visceral memory. Perhaps the most indelible of my memories of those years was the insidious prejudice that permeated my world.86 Eisner sets the graphic novel's recollections as a series of flashbacks in the mind of a young man, Willie, who is on a troop train on his way to basic training in 1942. In contrast to the reveries of The Dreamer 's title character, which focus on progress and opportunity, these focus on the static, never-ending fact of prejudice and antisemitism in the New World as well as the Old World. Near the graphic novel's beginning (set in 1928), we see antisemitic neighbors beating up young Willie; in response, his father tells him how much worse it was in Europe and that clever avoidance is the only response. His father, it emerges, had been a talented artist in Europe but had been browbeaten by his artist master and constantly exposed to antisemitic rhetoric, including a long speech about German and Austrian racial purity.87 Willie's mother tells how her oldest brother, Irving, studying to become a doctor, denies his family and his heritage because antisemitism might keep him out of medical school; he later converts to Christianity.88 But neither social assimilation nor conversion is sufficient to overcome the prejudice Eisner sees: In To the Heart of the Storm, though Willie's aunt converts as well, her non-Jewish husband, Frank, remarks disparagingly that "underneath she's still a Jew ... ha ha y'cant change the stripes on a zebra!"89 Attempts by Willie and others to "pass" fail: Willie's strong relationship with Buck, a German-American friend, falls apart as his and his family's increasing antisemitism comes to the fore, and his romance with a young woman named Heidi falls apart at her graduation party when she discovers his Jewishness.90 The graphic novel ends, years later, with another encounter between Willie and Buck, who has become a fount of antisemitism. Speaking about the war, Buck says, Ahh ... I'm sure you'll keep out of it ... most Jews will avoid the draft.... why do you think Hitler is trying to rid the world of Jews? ... They don't join up 86. Eisner, To the Heart of the Storm, 3; see also Eisner's characterization of the graphic novel in Benson, "Having Something to Say," 128. 87. Ibid., 93-94. Eisner's father was involved in painting sets and backdrops for the theater, which would influence his son's future approach to his craft. Eisner once remarked in an interview, "I was hardly theatrical, but I'm interested in the theater and I mentioned to you about my early life with my father doing back sets and stage sets... what I'm trying to get at is that I view the panel as a stage... and I move the furniture, the elements, around... until I get the story told. I spend a lot of time arranging my characters. I literally compose a panel" (Eisner, Shop Talk, 90). See also Eisner, "Before the Comics," 72. 88. Ibid., 57-61. 89. Ibid., 142. 90.

They eat away at every society they infest! And now they're pushing America into a war with Germany! ... A plot engineered by the Jewish bankers.91 Eisner's transitional approach is more artful than this account may imply. First, Eisner takes pains to show that there is discrimination (perhaps even antisemitism) among different communities of Jews-for example, bias against German or eastern European Jews.92 Eisner certainly spends time discussing other problems that affected the Jewish community besides antisemitism, such as the crushing poverty discussed in his earlier autobiographical works.93 Finally, Eisner is intent on showing antisemitism as part of a broad spectrum of generally distasteful and immoral behavior, which, depending on one's perspec- tive, either creates more compelling portraits of these individuals or caricatures them further.94 Nonetheless, To the Heart of the Storm marks a significant change in emphasis for Eisner. Though Eisner would continue to produce works that drew on his autobiographical experiences and the milieu of his birth-most notably, Minor Miracles (2000)-many of the graphic novels produced in the last decade of his life focused more broadly on historically oriented questions of antisemitism and general prejudice. Particularly pressing for Eisner was the usage of visual propaganda, and particularly stereotypes, in disseminating and strengthening these prejudicial attitudes. This was particularly the case, as we will see, given his own past history in the field of visual art and his aesthetic approach to issues of caricature and its necessity in graphic novels and cartooning. III. EISNER'S JEWISH WORK: HISTORIES In the introduction to his 2003 work Fagin the Jew, Eisner goes back into his own personal history and the history of his own artistic oeuvre to partially explain his choice of subject material and theme. Eisner writes that The Spirit featured a young African American boy, Ebony, as a humorous counterfoil. This was hardly innovative; Jack Benny had Rochester, the movies had Stepin Fetchit, and radio had Amos and Andy. These were accepted stereo- typical caricatures at the time. It was an era in our cultural history when the misuse of English based on ethnic origin was fashionable humor. Ebony spoke with the classic "Negro" dialect and delivered a gentle humor that 91. Ibid., 192-93. 92. Ibid., 180-81. This appears in some of Eisner's other works as well. For example, in The Name of the Game, the German Jews express prejudice against the Russian Jews, who are portrayed as dishonest (16); the clubs founded by German Jews because they are excluded from non-Jewish clubs themselves exclude Jews of Russian descent (19). 93. See especially his mother's story of orphanhood in Ibid., 42-56. 94. For example, Buck's father is revealed to be a drunken domestic abuser (Ibid., 169-71), and individuals who use the word "kike" are later shown to be adulterers (Ibid., 194-95). 296</page><page sequence="21">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History gave warmth to balance the coldness of crime stories.... as I continued my career in instructional comics, I never recognized that my rendering of Ebony, when viewed historically, was in conflict with the rage I felt when I saw antisemitism in art and literature.95 Admittedly, Eisner's twenty-first century retrospective apologias may leave con- temporary readers unprepared for the wide-eyed, thick-lipped, broken dialect- speaking Ebony White, to say nothing of his equally stereotyped girlfriend Scarlett Brown and other problematic caricatures of Hispanics and Asians.96 Still, Eisner's feelings about his own previous work were not, by his own admission, the primary catalyst for his reengagement with issues of visual stereotype. Rather, it stemmed both from his exploration of the theoretical bases of his art and from his historical research into prejudice: I became conscious over the years while teaching sequential art ... my lectures invariably had to confront the issue of stereotype. I concluded that there was "bad" stereotype and "good" stereotype; intention was the key. Since stereo- type is an essential tool in the language of graphic storytelling, it is incumbent on cartoonists to recognize its impact on social judgment ... So it is with this background and an awareness of the influence of imagery on popular culture that I began to produce graphic novels with themes of Jewish ethnicity and the prejudice Jews still face. A few years ago, as I was examining folktales and literary classics for possible graphic adaptation, I became aware of the origins of the ethnic stereotypes we accept without question.97 Well before 2003, Eisner articulated his perspective on stereotype and caricature in his lectures and corresponding books on the subject; he refers to the stereotype as "a fact of life" and "an accursed necessity." Based on a vaguely evol- utionary argument that "modem humans still retain instincts developed as primor- dials" and thus have a long-standing understanding of the meanings of a given set of facial configurations and gestures, as well as a sense of symbols that are "uni- versally valid," Eisner asserts that because comic book drawings "depend on the reader's stored memory of experience to visualize an idea or process quickly," images must be simplified into easily repeatable symbols-"ergo, stereotypes."98 95.

According to Eisner, in determining and identifying these symbols, gestures, and body 297</page><page sequence="22">Jeremy Dauber Eisner's argument is a bit subtler than this sketch suggests: He does point out, for example, that "when the plot is arranged to support it," the stereotypes of, say, doctor visuals "can be abandoned in favor of a type suitable to the story environ- ment."99 In general, however, his defense of caricature and stereotype is a robust one. However, Eisner's utilitarian approach, which attempts to maximize effective communication by appealing to universally recognizable images, can be seen to generate its own problems. Take, for example, the portrayals of Jews in Eisner's early graphic novels. As early as A Contract with God, Eisner relies on stereotyped images of Jews throughout the piece. Though Eisner proudly speaks of "actuality," the hyperrealism he employs subtly deforms image to reflect both communicative and thematic concerns. It seems clear that, even with the difference of shaven beard and hair loss, Frimme Hersh before he breaks the contract only vaguely resembles the "Frim" Hersh of afterward in terms of posture, weight, and specifically facial features. In making this change, one can see how complexly and problematically Eisner has drawn oin the typical antisemitic image of the Jewish capitalist, with his thick lips and jowls, to make his point. In The Neighborhood: Dropsie Avenue, many different ethnic groups move in (and out) of the neighborhood. The Jews who do are primarily represented in the graphic novel by two character: Izzy Cashclothes and Abie Gold. In both cases, Eisner traffics in Jewish stereotype, both visually and characterologically: Izzy is drawn as a short, crude, hairy man (and thanks to the perspective that comics provide, he is drawn as approximately three feet tall).'00 Starting as a peddler, he works his way up to being a tenement slumlord. Abie Gold, by contrast, is presented as the fighting Jewish liberal. He represents all of the various ethnicities as a ward councilman, and-significantly for Eisner's vision-brings together the various elements of the neighborhood through his own life: He marries an Italian girl from the neighborhood, allowing, in several scenes, for cooperation between the priest and the rabbi. Portrayed with the high forehead and the glasses of an intellectual, Gold uses his law practice not for the accumulation of wealth but to support the poor and dispossessed.0'1 It may be that Eisner's portrayal of Jews in The Neighborhood allows him to work out his mixed feelings about Jewish ethnicity by concretizing them in various forms. But what is clear is that language, the artist draws on "personal observations and an inventory of gestures, common and com- prehensible to the reader" (Comics and Sequential Art, 101). 99. Eisner, Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative, 18. 100. This also speaks to Eisner's move away from what he refers to as "representational photographic illustration," which has, with the advance of technology, been replaced by photographs. For Eisner, the technical accuracy of people and primarily things-often but not always based on refer- ence to stock illustrations-has given way to more impressionistic renderings that are illustrative of individual artists' personalities; see Eisner, Shop Talk, 149, 239. On the history of the combination of cartoonish/iconic characters against photorealist backgrounds, see McCloud, Understanding Comics, 42-44. 101. For example, his family is the first to support the new black immigration into Dropsie Avenue. 298</page><page sequence="23">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History in doing so, he engages with-and perhaps problematically, perpetuates-the tragic history of Jewish representation in graphic media more generally. Such considerations inevitably affect and arguably catalyze Eisner's research into caricature and antisemitic prejudice, which reach their height in his preparation for Fagin the Jew: Upon examining the illustrations of the original editions of Oliver Twist, I found an unquestionable example of visual defamation in classic literature. The memory of their awful use by the Nazis in World War II, one hundred years later, added evidence to the persistence of evil stereotyping. Combating it became an obsessive pursuit, and I realized that I had no choice but to under- take a truer portrait of Fagin by telling his life story in the only way I could. 02 As Eisner suggests, unlike other literary adaptations he worked on, Fagin the Jew is not a faithful retelling of Oliver Twist; instead, as Eisner writes in his introduction, it is an imagined autobiography of Fagin, narrated by the thief to Charles Dickens as he sits in his cell awaiting his execution by hanging.103 In Eisner's retelling, Fagin presents himself as Moses Fagin, the son of Jewish refu- gees from Bohemia. As a child peddler in London, he sees his father die before his eyes, beaten to death by his Gentile bookies when he tries to collect his winnings from betting on a boxing match between the Anglo-Jewish boxer Daniel Mendoza and the non-Jewish Joe Ward. As his father lies expiring in the street, Fagin calls out for help; he is ignored by the passing gentlefolk, who claim that it is a "Jewish trick."'104 Eisner continues to craft an even darker history for Fagin in the following pages. Doing so allows him to create a sympathetic explanation for Fagin's turn to crime on the personal and communal level, in much the same way that certain early modern apologists for Jews claim that any problematic social behavior comes from externally imposed social circumstances, not essential characteristics. It also allows him to integrate scenes, characters, and moments from Anglo-Jewish history into the narrative.'05 Fagin's mother dies; as an orphan, he is apprenticed as a houseboy to a rich Ashkenazic Jew. There, he encounters members of England's Sephardic community, including the father of Benjamin Disraeli, who are constantly considering baptism as a means to enter English society.106 After an abortive romance with a wealthy Sephardic girl, the 102.

He muses, "Who knows, if I were not a Jew ... I might not be standing in a knot of people on a London street operating a street game with a new partner, a ruffian named Sikes."108 Indeed, Fagin's transformation into a Jew is not merely accomplished through his interactions with Jewish history and commu- nity: By the end of the graphic novel, in his final interaction with Oliver, Fagin says the Shema, reinforcing his image as a Jewish believer as well.109 Eisner's comments in his introduction notwithstanding, he dedicates most of the rest of the graphic novel to retelling Oliver Twist. The ending of the graphic novel, however, substantially diverges from its literary source. Much of the story's ending is dedicated to a debate set in Fagin's prison cell between Fagin and his creator, Charles Dickens, in which the former takes the latter to task for his role in generating antisemitic sentiment through his reliance on stereotype: Fagin: "I've asked you here to confront a man you wrongfully portrayed! One who will soon be swinging lifeless in that yard! ... Doomed to wear for eter- nity that warped and evil image!" Dickens: "How else would you have it, Fagin?? Are you not among the wretches who inhabit the cold underworld of London? ... In Oliver Twist, I try to show the principle of good that does survive through every adverse circumstance! It is a truth that needs to be told!" Fagin: "Truth?? Is referring to a man only by his race the truth? Or is Jew as a word for criminal true? Or is a picture of a Jew that is based upon a common bias ... truth? Hah!! I am Fagin, a member of a dispersed but noble breed! Jews who are often forced by circumstance to survive in the foul, frowsy dens and squalid misery of midnight London are not thieves by choice!... Are there no Gentile Money lenders or sly receivers of suspect goods in London??... Is this trade truly confined to Jews alone? Artists and writers have always described for us whom we fear and whom we trust! You and your kind, therefore, are responsible for the endurance in bias ... in this case against Jews! ... A Jew is not Fagin any more than a Gentile is Sikes!"'l0 This exchange notwithstanding, Eisner indicates in his afterword to Fagin the Jew that it is not only Charles Dickens whom he wishes to put in the dock but also Dickens's illustrator, George Cruikshank. Both were complicit in the "description and delineation of Fagin as a classic stereotypical Jew," but in his comments, 107. Ibid., 25-34.

Ibid., 112-14. 300</page><page sequence="25">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History Eisner seems to reserve particular ire for Cruikshank because he understands his temptations more personally: Cartoonists certainly understand how easy it is to rely on a common image in the visual language to portray a character, but like the mistakes of illustrators before him, Cruikshank's misuse of a necessary staple in portraying Fagin, one that was so common to contemporary publications, is a contribution to further reprehensible stereotyping of Jews by bigots throughout history.11' Given Eisner's own sense of personal responsibility and responsibility to the field of visual narrative, it is worth at least briefly considering Eisner's own visual strategies throughout Fagin the Jew. In what is clearly a considered move of frus- trating stereotypical expectations, Eisner portrays Fagin as a handsome young man before the depredations visited upon him by English "justice." If Jews look anything like their stereotypical images, we are meant to understand, it is because of prejudice, not nature. At the graphic novel's end, in the encounter described pre- viously, Eisner draws a particularly pathetic Fagin and a dark and shadowy Dickens; the latter's face is never revealed, and he lurks in the comers in a way conventionally and visually designated as the villain of the piece-as, for Eisner, he is.112 We begin to see Eisner's growing sense that visual media are not only a strong source of propaganda but counterpropaganda as well, and it is therefore somewhat unsurprising that Eisner's next work after Fagin the Jew is dedicated to polemically combating one of the most infamous pieces of propaganda in the history of antisemitic prejudice, The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (2005). In his introduction to The Plot, Eisner once more explains the catalyst for his latest creation in terms of personal history, national history, and the history of the graphic novel. Asserting that The Plot "marks an effort to deploy this powerful medium to address a matter of immense personal concern," he writes about his own experiences with American antisemitism and his parents' European "shtetl atti- tude ... who advised that we should 'be quiet and not offend the goyim,"' which led to his investigation of antisemitism's sources and, eventually, an examination of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.113 However, in The Plot, Eisner is finally able to bring together his twin goals of championing graphic novels and Jewish causes. He argues that the "hundreds of books and competent scholarly studies" that have exposed the fraudulent nature of the Protocols have failed because of their esoteric language or their ability to preach only to those convinced of their position, and he suggests that his own medium may succeed where other media have failed: I have spent my career in the application of sequential art as a form of narra- tive language. With the widespread acceptance of the graphic narrative as a 111. Ibid., 124 (afterword). 112. Cf. Harvey's comments in Ibid., 127-28. 113. Eisner, The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (New York: W. W. Norton, 2006), 1. 301</page><page sequence="26">Jeremy Dauber vehicle of popular literature, there is now an opportunity to deal head on with this propaganda in a more accessible language. It is my hope that, perhaps, this work will drive yet another nail into the coffin of this terrifying vampire-like fraud.114 As in his earlier works, however, Eisner's optimistic fantasies about the transcendent power of (graphic) art-here he even goes so far as to suggest a poss- ible change of long-standing historical trends of the dissemination and acceptance of the Protocols-are matched by a skepticism that comes from long observance of human nature and history. Much of the graphic novel, after going through the history of the fabrication of the Protocols in great detail, is dedicated to numerous instances of the "discovery" and dissemination of its fraudulence. Eisner con- stantly accompanies these instances with dialogue such as, "This fraud will soon be well known everywhere ... so, my boy, what harm can the 'protocols' possibly do now?" (On the next page, the reader sees Hitler lecturing in 1921 Germany.)'15 A Swiss judge in the 1930s rules that "I regard the 'protocols' as ridiculous nonsense!" The section ends with, "This should put an end to the Protocols at last."16 A facsimile of the first page of the Senate report on the spurious nature of the Protocols in 1964 is accompanied by a character's statement that "[w]ell, that puts an end to the 'protocols' once and for all! No one will be able to use it again!""'17 And yet the Protocols continue to be published, of course, and Eisner's methods both for displaying it and for debunking it indicate his mastery of his visual medium."8 Immediately after that Senate report, the action of the graphic novel shifts to a library in California in 1993, where a (somewhat stilted) conversation between a researcher and a librarian allows Eisner to provide a history of the continued printings of the Protocols, including Spanish, Italian, Argentinean, Egyptian, Indian, Japanese, Mexican, Turkish, Russian, and British editions, among others."19 Eisner takes great pains to show us many of the highly visually striking and radically antisemitic covers of those editions (it is hard to tell from this printing whether he has redrawn them or simply reprinted them using computer technology), indicating 114.

I guess that's something you'll have to find out" (Ibid., 121). Indeed it does not, as scenes set in 2000, 2001, and 2002 show (Ibid., 122-24). Eisner gives his last word to a wordless full-page drawing of a synagogue explosion; on the following page, we see papers floating out of the explosion containing accounts of various antisemitic incidents that occurred internationally in 2003, accompanied by the center graphic, "2004 The Protocols of Zion are still sold in bookstores around the world" (Ibid., 127-28). 119.

Notably, the person looking for research visually resembles Eisner. 302</page><page sequence="27">Comic Books, Tragic Stories: Will Eisner's American Jewish History again how much the propaganda here is dedicated to the visual than the textual.120 Eisner uses his skills as a visual artist to accentuate his counterpolemic, though not only to display the dimensions of the problem. Much of the graphic novel is dedicated to a meeting in Constantinople with an editor of the London Times who will be among the first, if not the first, to publicly claim the Protocols a forgery. It is hardly a coincidence that Eisner draws his positive British character to look like Sherlock Holmes, complete with a pipe and a vaguely deerstalker-like hat.121 In doing so, Eisner clearly hopes to subtly convince readers of the truth of that character's position as he detects the similarities between the Protocols and its actual source, derogatory material about Napoleon III written by Maurice Joly in the mid-nineteenth century to oppose the French emperor's plans to defeat Germany. Leah Finkelshteyn also notes Eisner's use of stock characters in his portrayal of Matthieu Golovinski, the writer of the Protocols, who "is obviously a 'bad guy' with his squinty eyes and piggish expressions."'122 The graphic novel form, particularly in the hands of a visual experimenter such as Eisner, is also uniquely suitable for proving the similarities between the two works, as it allows for both texts to be laid out side by side for comparison. Often, the Holmesian figure is drawn beneath them, commenting on the images above; examples include, "Aha! ... A very obvious copy, almost word for word and a careful insertion of modem language such as people's rights' and 'repub- lican rights,"'"23 "Here we can see how clearly an idea is copied,"'124 and so on, perhaps culminating in "[c]learly, the protocols author adapts the text of 'dialo- gues' so carelessly in his hasty attempt to prove a Jewish conspiracy!"'25 There are numerous similar examples; Eisner, in this respect and this respect only like those he detests, is not the most subtle of propagandists. As we have seen, a man who believes in the regrettable necessity of stereotype and caricature may not find that there is much room for subtlety when the stakes are as high as they are. The Plot marks a new movement in Eisner's work into the mainstream; published by a mainstream press, W. W. Norton, and boasting an introduction by an unquestionably major figure in the literary world, Umberto Eco, it paved the way for the new release of hardbound versions of all his graphic 120. Besides Eisner's own natural gravitation to the visual aspect of the Protocols (which, given the textual nature of the book, means a focus on the cover), Eisner's emphasis on the covers may also stem from his awareness that the Protocols themselves are rather hard to read. 121. Cf. Tom Underhill, "Hail Hydra," Comics Journal, no. 267 (April-May 2005), 191-93, 193, who points out that the figure is a dead ringer for Basil Rathbone, the actor who played Sherlock Holmes in early film versions of the stories. 122.

Whether this pulpit will allow Eisner's perspective on prejudice and on his past to be accepted more widely, is, of course, impossible to know. But it may be enough to encourage more thinking about a major American Jewish writer and a less considered means of American Jewish writing.
