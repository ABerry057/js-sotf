<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stephen D. Benin. The Footprints of God: Divine Accommodation in Jewish and Christian Thought. SUNY Series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism, and Religion. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. xxi, 327 pp. This book is a comprehensive study of the long history of a hermeneutic principle known as "divine accommodation," the manner in which divine revelation adapts itself and is, in turn, adapted to human cognitive capacities over time. Ranging from Paul in the first century C.E. to Herder at the end of the eighteenth, the book covers the use of accommodation in a wide range of Jewish and Christian sources in orders of discourse as diverse as polemics, literature, philosophy, theology, and mysticism. As the first extensive study of an important interpretative principle, the book is a long-overdue, welcome contribution to many disciplines, especially biblical studies and theology. There is little doubt that it can serve as an excellent reference source for future substantive studies of particular thinkers. Stephen Benin has mastered an overwhelming amount of material in sup- port of the challenging and controversial thesis that, despite radical historical and conceptual transformations, the principle of divine accommodation is uniquely capable of exhibiting both the unity in diversity of discourses and the continuity underlying radical historical change. The very scope of the work involved in this study and the vast scholarly knowledge and attention</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 415 to detail evident in it lessen the overall importance of any critical comments in comparison to Benin's achievement. But, although a critical evaluation of the work may seem petty, the challenging thesis and ambitious scope of the work invite a serious response. The book's subtitle, "Divine Accommodation in Jewish and Christian Thought," as well as the descriptive reviews on the cover are somewhat misleading, for they foster the impression that this is a balanced comparative study of Jewish and Christian sources. Of the eight chapters constituting the book, however, only two, the fifth and the sixth, are devoted to Jewish sources, whereas the eighth is devoted to secular appropriations of accommodation in the modem period. Moreover, the decided bulk of the study and its most sensitive, nuanced treatment is devoted to the patristic period. Chapter 1 is a survey of the development of the notion of accommodation and the central role it played in the-formation of Christian doctrine. It examines its dual, interrelated development as both a negative and a positive principle for interpreting biblical texts in the writings of Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, and Athanasius. Insofar as negative accommodation is used to articulate the radical difference between nascent Christianity and Judaism, insofar as it provides Christianity's raison d'etre by emphasizing the punitive nature of Jewish law, it serves as the foundation for the positive use of the principle. Tracing its origins back to Paul, Benin sketches the various, highly polemical, early Christian articulations of Jewish law as a restraint against a perverse, idolatrous humanity that is positively redeemed by Christ. Tracing accommodation's positive developments, Benin also briefly examines Christianity's claims to spiritual superiority in the light of the Gnostic claims to a more lofty spirituality. While Benin's scholarly objectivity in treating the diverse sources is commendable, it is unfortunate that nowhere in the book does he reflect upon the dual tension constituting the early development of accommodation nor upon the possible consequences of the "negative," apologetic foundation of this principle. Presumably for the same reason, Benin also refrains from evaluating the relative merits of competing claims. Since the entire study depends upon the force of the principle of accommodation to withstand criticism and radical change, the lack of critical evaluation robs the book of a clear focus and leaves it to the reader to provide the substantive thread(s) unifying the diverse and divergent narrative summaries. In the light of the fact that one of the book's primary virtues and its most useful contribution to future scholarship is its presentation of a tremendously</page><page sequence="3">416 BOOK REVIEWS diverse body of materials within a single, relatively short study, and for reasons of economy, an outline of the content of chapters 2 through 8 is called for prior to its general evaluation. Chapter 2 surveys the development and adaptation of accommodation by the Antiochene and Cappadocian church fathers, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, and Theodoret of Cyprus. Chapter 3 is devoted to the highly polemical Syriac writings of Aphrahat, Ephrem, Isaac of Antioch, and Jacob of Sarug. Chapter 4 outlines the Latin development of accommodation up to the thirteenth century in the writings of St. Augustine, Hugh of St. Victor, and Anselm of Havelberg. Chapter 5 briefly examines the use of accommodation in rabbinic literature. Chapter 6 traces its development in Karaite literature, Sa'adia Gaon, Bahya ibn Pakuda, Judah ha-Levi, Maimonides, Nahmanides, Gersonides, Ibn Kaspi, and the Zohar literature up to Dov Baer, the Magid of Mezhirech. It also devotes a few words to the fifteenth-century anti-Maimonidean Isaac Arama and to the Maimonidean, Abarvanel. Chapter 7 first outlines the repercussions of Maimonides' thought on William of Auvergne's and Thomas Aquinas' divergent applications of accommodation to divine law; second, it sketches its subsequent adaptations and transformations by Nicholas of Lyra, Jacques Lef'evre, and Luther; finally it discusses, in greater detail, accommodation's central role in Calvin's writings. The very brief chapter 8 covers the survival of accommodation in the eighteenth century from the radically antireligious French philosophes to Vico, Lessing, and Herder. Its nine pages attempt to illustrate the claim that the philosophes' vitriolic rejection of religion was as much based upon the idea of accommodation as was the new understanding of (to quote Kant) "religion within the bounds of reason alone." The extensive notes to the chapters as well as the bibliography provide an invaluable apparatus for future research. In the brief conclusion Benin indicates his awareness of the dangers inherent in his ambitious study. As he states, "There is, of course, a certain danger in attempting to describe the history of an idea and capture its myriad applications in seemingly countless different literatures and times" (p. 209). Ironically, while the conclusion underscores the fact that accommodation "originated in the realm of religious polemics and apologetics and was confined to that sphere throughout the patristic, medieval and Reformation periods" (ibid.), Benin neither confines his study to this realm nor ever alludes to the distinction between substantive positive developments of the idea and</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 417 its polemical use, nor does he draw necessary distinctions between marginal and significant thinkers, let alone evaluate more nuanced and highly relevant differences within generally similar positions. The reader of this study is left with the uneasy sense that, notwithstanding Benin's thesis, accommodation is a radically equivocal term only nominally applicable to the historically and generically diverse discourses in which it is used and abused. While detailed scholarship on minor polemicists, such as Aphrahat and Ephrem, may be important in order to balance the scales of evaluation as well as shed interesting light on major thinkers, it is highly doubtful that they can be treated with the same measuring rod as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, and even more doubtful that their use of accommodation remotely resembles that of Maimonides and Gersonides. In the light of Benin's detailed, nuanced, and very sensitive treatment of the Greek and Syriac patristic sources covered in the first three chapters of the book, a sensitivity that reemerges in his treatment of Calvin, whom he describes, not unexpectedly, as "almost unequalled in his exploitation of accommodation," with the exception of Chrysostom (p. 197), the reader cannot but conclude that Benin's real scholarly interests and sensitivity remain with these sources. It is to be hoped that his future work will explore in greater and finer detail the intriguing similarity between Chrysostom and Calvin.
