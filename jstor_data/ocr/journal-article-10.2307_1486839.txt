New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992. xxvi, 173 pp. A late medieval German manuscript containing judicial documents con- nected with the 1475 ritual murder accusation and trial against the Jews of Trent was given to Yeshiva University in 1988. R. Po-Chia Hsia's study of this manuscript and its context, undertaken at the invitation of Yeshiva University, is a highly readable anatomy of the texts it contains; it reflects constant awareness of environment, history, religion, politics, gender, personality, and mediated testimony. Hsia's compelling narrative offers a detailed portrait of a Jewish community on the verge of destruction, framed by a late medieval Europe torn by ecclesiastical and secular power struggles, obsessed with heresy and witchcraft, and threatened by Turkish incursions. In this time and</page><page sequence="2">428 BOOK REVIEWS place, church, state, and popular antisemitism converged in a vision of Jews as quintessential internal enemies of Christians. Hsia argues that the purpose of the Trent ritual murder trial was not only to prove Jewish guilt in the particular case of the murdered child, Simon, whose body had apparently been placed in the cellar of a Jewish home on Easter Sunday, but to demonstrate that Jewish rituals and traditions were inherently evil, "that the very essence of Jewish [Passover] rites ... demanded the sacrifice of Christian boys" (p. 94). The Yeshiva University manuscript is a compilation of texts from several sources, representing the official story of the ritual murder in Trent. It was commissioned in 1478-79, during the popular campaign to secure the canonization of "Little Martyr Simon" in Rome, following papal vindication of Bishop Hinderbach of Trent of charges of judicial misconduct in the trial of the accused Jews. The manuscript records versions of the interrogations under judicial torture of nineteen men and four women of the Trent Jewish community which were conducted bilingually in German and Italian, with simultaneous transcription into Latin, and occasional statements in Hebrew. Hsia observes that beyond these linguistic transformations, "the manuscript reflects a far more sinister translation--one which transgresses the boundary between fact and fantasy, collapsing voluntary statements into involuntary confessions and distorting Jewish rites into a Christian ethnography of barbarism" (p. xxiv). The northern Italian city of Trent, combining Italian and German pop- ulation and cultural features, was a bishopric. The powers of the German, Vienna-educated, Bishop Johannes Hinderbach, however, were circumscribed both by the feudal authority of Archduke Sigismund of Tirol and by the Italian-dominated papacy in Rome. In prosecuting his case against the Jews of Trent, Hinderbach faced opposition from both these quarters, and, as Hsia demonstrates, his determination to convict was driven as much by political self-assertion as by his pious conviction of Jewish guilt. The thirty Jews of Trent, mostly immigrants from German-speaking Cen- tral Europe, lived in three multigenerational households. The backgrounds, family relationships, and everyday activities of these men and women are preserved in their testimony. From these transcripts Hsia describes their lives and histories, as well as those of the several Jewish visitors who were trapped in their midst when disaster struck, and tracks the varying responses of each individual to the calamity with which the community was faced.

Two of the household heads were moneylenders, although of different social status, and the third was a physician. Although all three households had frequent contacts with Christians as business clients, patients, occasional servants, neighbors, and friends, the Jews were fundamentally outsiders in their German-speaking neighborhood, set apart by religion, occupation, and prosperity. Put to judicial torture, which often far exceeded the bounds permitted by law, and subjected to repeated brutal interrogations, the Jewish men were broken one by one, and offered the testimony they believed their interrogators wanted to hear. Efforts at intercession organized by Jewish leaders from other communities proved fruitless in altering the obdurate determination of Bishop Hinderbach to convict, as did efforts to obtain freedom for at least some of the Jews by a papal commissioner, Baptista Dei Guidici, sent from Rome to investigate the case. Over the course of a few months, most of the men of the community were executed. Some of the Jewish women, held under house arrest, were also interrogated. Their testimony reveals the highly differentiated gender roles within the small community, because women's limited part in Jewish worship and ritual made it possible for them to plead ignorance of events in which the men might have been involved. As Hsia writes, "Perceived as the weaker sex and marginalized in religious rituals, the women were under less pressure to conform to the image of the demonic Jew" (p. 115); spared the death penalty, all the women were ultimately compelled to accept baptism. Hsia's multilayered version of this terrible story of a community's destruc- tion reveals in microcosm the mounting pressures which were threatening Jewish existence in western and central Europe as the Middle Ages moved to their close. It is a story which bears retelling, particularly when it is so abundantly documented by vivid voices from the past. Judith R.
