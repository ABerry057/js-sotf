<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hyman Bogen. The Luckiest Orphans: A History of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992. 283 pp. Even the title of this easily-overlooked volume, The Luckiest Orphans, beckons the reader to delve into its pages, for it represents a treasured institutional relic that has now, as a result of the labors of Hyman Bogen, secured its rightful place in American Jewish history. In this book, Bogen skillfully blends collective memoirs and dedicated research, gently molding them into a history of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York. This orphan asylum, a term by which such institutions were generally known, was the oldest, largest, and perhaps best-known of its kind. It operated in New York City between the years 1860 and 1941. Hyman Bogen is himself a former resident (or a member of its alumni, as they like to be called) who lived within its walls from 1932 until it closed in 1941. Thus, The Luckiest Orphans is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 289 not merely a piece of detached inquiry. It is admittedly a labor of love, an in-kind reciprocation for what the Hebrew Orphan Asylum gave its inmates (the term by which they were known), Hyman Bogen among them. Beyond the obvious contribution to the history of American Jewish social welfare institutions and the commensurate contribution the Hebrew Orphan Asylum made to the community by caring for children without parents (or whose parents could not afford to raise them), The Luchiest Orphans also reflects the turmoil, in-fighting, and competition among the various segments of the American Jewish community during the period in which the home functioned. From its very beginning, the Hebrew Orphan Asylum was caught in the cross-fire between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, uptown and downtown Jews, traditionalists and reformers. Yet, amidst all the conflict, it somehow guided hundreds of boys and girls into young adulthood, many of whom went on to make major contributions to society and amass great fortunes. They indeed did become "the luckiest orphans." By no fault of their own, these young Jewish boys and girls had become society's least wanted. In response to the Dickens-like conditions in many orphanages, and sensitive to the historical mandate to care for its "widows and orphans." the Jewish community strove to create an institution which would nurture these young souls and train them to be contributing members of society. This was not an easy task. Competent caregivers were hard to come by. Funds were often scarce. And there were many differences of opinion regarding the Jewish education and religious training of the residents. There were scandals and shortcomings, to be sure. Yet, the Hebrew Orphan Asylum generally succeeded and, at times, even created model vocational-training programs which were copied by like-minded institutions in New York and beyond. This book succeeds in putting flesh onto the Hebrew Orphan Asylum's struggle throughout its history: Together, through the pages of The Luckiest Orphans, we are able to come very close to the daily experience of living in the home at any given time in its history. Together, we feel the pain of its residents and the pride of its lay governors. Because of the nature of Bogen's research, much of the discussion in the book is based either on his own recollections or on the reminiscences of others-often with little evidence of corroboration. While the application of this technique adds to the human dimension of what otherwise might be dull history, such methods are often subject to error. As a result, for the informed reader, there are some statements</page><page sequence="3">290 BOOK REVIEWS which are not quite precise. So fastidious a reading, however, does not detract from the overall strength of the manuscript and the contribution that Bogen makes by bringing this significant book and the institution it heralds to our attention.
