They reminisce with even greater pride on their remarkable achievements fifty years ago as neighborhood activists and Jewish commun- ity builders. In 1940, their informal association of teenagers, unhappy with a Board of Education decision which denied them access to an afterschool recreational center, successfully petitioned a city bureaucracy to open club rooms and gym facilities to them. Flushed with their sense of power and enthused with a sense of social responsibility, these youngsters went on to create, without any adult supervision, a model mutual-aid society. The BBC, over the course of the early 1940s, negotiated with city officials to install lights in public parks for evening games, worked with the police department in counseling youthful offenders, and even arranged for many indigent Jewish children to attend summer camps. Both Boys Club alumni and their historian, Gerald Sorin, honestly believe that these neighborhood- based efforts played no small role in limiting criminality and other social pathologies within this poor area of Brooklyn. Whatever the hyperbole about the BBC as crime-stoppers-Murder, Inc., the infamous Jewish underworld gang, also recruited successfully in Brownsville in the 1940s-this uncommon youth group was undeniably a major focal point of neighborhood life. And the critical impetus for these initiatives was these American Jewish boys' strong affinity for certain basic Jewish values and traditions. Significantly and insightfully, Sorin suggests that their activism represented a continuation, within an American vein, of parental values that were fashioned on the Lower East Side, if not in Eastern Europe. Many of the parents of BBC members had been involved in both religious or secular mutual-aid societies and in unions downtown, and they had transferred this faith in group effort and gemilas chesed to their Brook- lyn-raised offspring. Likewise, many immigrant parents had participated in progressive social and political life here and in Eastern Europe, and their belief in "the promise of politics and the power and respect inherent in organization" (p. 57) was not lost upon their teenage children, who strident- ly, but respectfully, protested against Board of Education bureaucracy. That Judaism and their parents' values deeply influenced the leaders of the BBC speaks well of the persistence of immigrant Jewish culture and eth- nic identity beyond downtown and the first generation. Their experience suggests that Brownsville's youth leaders were part of an identifiable seg- ment of second-generation Jews who successfully acculturated to this country without acquiring a concomitant disrespect for their elders' past.</page><page sequence="3">356 BOOK REVIEWS Intergenerational conflict and profound disaffection from Judaism were seemingly minimal among BBC members-even if most of them rarely entered a synagogue after their Bar Mitzvah. Moreover, BBC youths were able to learn about American life in the public schools without assimilating the antipathy for immigrant culture that was frequently an implicit by- product of the curriculum. Indeed, upon receiving their high school diplo- mas, most would go on to earn college and university degrees and would choose careers that reflected their continuing allegiance to certain tradition- al Jewish values. A full 35 percent of the BBC alumni studied by Sorin ulti- mately earned their livings in "the helping professions" (p. 199). These Brownsville youngsters, Sorin argues, were part of the segment of second- generation Jews, "culturally predisposed by the 'socialist orientation' of their parents' generation and by the yiddishkayt that surrounded them" (p. 55), who were attracted "in disproportionate numbers ... to the new social work for its recently established focus on social action and change" (p. 55). But for all the vitality of the Jewish identity transmitted by their parents, it was probably the extraordinary ambience of the Jewish "nurturing neigh- borhood" that best ensured ethnic continuity for that second generation. Indeed, it seems that more than schools and shuls, it was the very propin- quity of Jews to each other and the informality of "the Yiddish language of the street, home and business" (p.16) that buttressed Jewish identities and allegiances. Remarkably, Sorin draws on a 1941 study indicating that only 9 percent of Jewish adult males in Brownsville attended synagogues with any regularity, and yet it is clear from Sorin's anecdotal data that most Jews in the neighborhood felt that they strongly belonged to their people. Given the power of neighborhood as a preserver of identity, the decline of Jewish Brownsville and comparable Jewish enclaves of that period takes on additional meaning. To be sure, BBC members continued to succeed in America in the new suburban neighborhoods to which they migrated, even if alumni might sadly recall the end of their Brooklyn days as the close of the best years of their lives. BBC members became lawyers, engineers, cor- porate executives, and, of course, professional social workers in communi- ties like Jericho, Douglaston, Bellmore, and East Meadow, Long Island. There, they and their wives built enduring family units and witnessed their children, educated in good surburban public schools, achieve even greater academic success than they had. Yet one wonders what became of their Jewish connections-and even more importantly their children's identi- ties-in the ethnically mixed neighborhood. A remarkable lacuna in an</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 357 otherwise excellent book is that Sorin does not discuss how those whom he credits with helping to found a new American Jewish identity for their gen- eration of Jews were able or unable to transmit their feeling of Jewish belonging to their children. Without the crowded streets of Brownsville to count on, BBC alumni undoubtedly had to rely upon formal Jewish reli- gious and educational institutions to more consciously espouse group per- sistence. It would have been of interest to know of the BBC's success rate in this critical Jewish arena. Jeffrey S. Gurock Yeshiva University New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
