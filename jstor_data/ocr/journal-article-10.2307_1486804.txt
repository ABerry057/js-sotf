<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yehiel Zvi Moskowitz. The Book of Numbers. Da'at Miqra'. Jerusalem: Mosad HaRav Kook, 1988. 491 pp. (Hebrew). The appearance of the Da'at Miqra' commentary on Numbers (supple- mented by a more recent, two-volume exposition of Exodus) marks the beginning of the end of an important Israeli effort to produce a new Bible commentary. As the first published volume on the Torah, it is, in a real sense, a beginning; since the commentary on the rest of the Bible is in print,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 111 it also signals the project's rapidly approaching completion. The series, now well over twenty volumes, is quite different from the critical works to which both American and Israeli scholars are accustomed, but of interest to those who study the history of Jewish Bible interpretation, especially its contem- porary Orthodox manifestations. Like its predecessors, Numbers contains Mordecai Breuer's edition of the Bible, based on the Aleppo codex or (in the case of most of the Torah, which is missing from this model text) other witnesses to the same Masoretic tradition. It is supplemented by eight pages of minor Masoretic variants (differences in vocalization, cantillation signs, plene and defective spellings, etc.) which, together with the similar sections of the other volumes, provide the basis of a critical Masoretic Bible text, and may actually be the series' most lasting contribution. The introduction explores the name and structure of the book, the census lists, the organization of the tribes, the stopovers, and the various rebellions associated with Israel's travels in the wilderness. It is complemented by a list of the mitzvot, positive and negative, that appear in Numbers. Unlike the earlier volumes, this one includes Rashi's commentary in an annotated, vocalized, and improved edition, based on that of C. Chavel. This significant addition serves two important purposes. It simultaneously exposes those interested in Rashi to Da'at Miqra' and encourages those whose interest might be limited to the modern portion to share the project's solidarity with those who both recognize Rashi's work as the most popular Jewish Torah commentary ever produced and consider its continued study quintessential. Various introductions and summaries accompany individual passages, and a series of appendices include the weekly haftarot, brief essays on the book's prose and poetry, synoptic tables of the four Pentateuchal lists of the travels in the wilderness, and a brief discussion of biblical parallels to parts of Numbers. The vocalized commentary approaches the text with the goal of explaining the inner biblical significance of each passage, and attempts to do so with philological precision and historical accuracy. It assumes the reli- ability of the text and the information it contains, and draws upon tradition- al and scientific information known to clarify its problems or to explain its inherent difficulties. It is replete with sketches and reproductions of archaeological discoveries, ruins, ancient realia, and maps. Their visual quality ranges from fair to good, but some are so unclear as to be of only symbolic value. The better ones add an important dimension to a somewhat</page><page sequence="3">112 BOOK REVIEWS dull visual presentation, while helping to anchor the contents of Numbers in the historical and geographic realities of the ancient Near East. Throughout the volume, one finds constant reference to the best of clas- sical rabbinic Bible interpretation, be it ancient, medieval, or modern. One also notices a sensitivity to scholarly concerns, though this is very carefully controlled; problems least open to classical solutions or least approachable by Orthodox Jews are generally avoided. At first blush, the intended reader- ship may seem strange, because it must include those for whom a vocalized commentary is most useful, hardly educated Israelis or most synagogue- going Americans, but this may be a concession to the model provided by Da'at Miqra"s real predecessors. Compared to the commentaries of S. L. Gordon and of E. Hartom, and to Miqra' Meforash, Da'at Miqra' is more expansive, more developed, more modern, more sophisticated, more liter- ary, more informed about the contexts of biblical events, more philological- ly advanced, more attractive, and more attentive to the best rabbinic interpretation. It is a more valuable educational tool, one that, in many ways, offers the most sustained, open model of Orthodox Bible study to have appeared in decades. Compared to the incomparable American Ortho- dox Bible commentary by Artscroll, it is even better. B. Barry Levy McGill University Montreal, P.Q.</page></plain_text>
