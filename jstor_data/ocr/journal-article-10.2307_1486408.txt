AGNON by ESTHER FUCHS [Reb Zevi] saw and realized that the business was leading [Reb Issachar] astray, that he was being distracted by it and was distracting others, until final- ly he felt like one tugged by a distorted idea, a senseless bit of sophistry or vain embellishment, like one who becomes increasingly bogged down as he trudges from one pilpul to the next, from one piece of vanity to the next, until it finally drags him into a morass from which he can never emerge.' 1. The Ironic Character and the Referential Context The one who "sees and realizes" the errors of Reb Issachar, the prota- gonist of "The Collectors" ("Ha-Gabba'im") is Reb Zevi, his son-in-law. Reb Issachar himself does not recognize his misguided policies which bring about his economic failure and social deterioration. The latter's ignorance of his own misdeeds turns him into a victim of irony, an alazon. The irony is generated by the incongruity between the character's distorted perception of the situation described in the narrative and what is in fact implied by it. The 1. S. Y.

In this respect, it deviates from most Agnonic narratives which omit direct references to this incongruity. Given such textual reticence, how is the ironic characterization carried out? How does the text imply criticism without using verbal mediation? The ironic characterization becomes possible thanks to the reader's empirical knowledge and general acquaintance with the referential context of the nar- rative. In a reticent text, irony depends for mediation on the referential context, without which the reader would not have proper bench-marks for the evaluation of the characters or events.2 Underlying the ironic characteri- zation in the text is the incongruity between the reader's expectations and the character's interactions with the narrative situation. This incongruity may be created, not only by the character's assertions and actions but by his failure to act according to the logic of the narrative situation. The failure of the text to react to the character's misperceptions suggests that its objectiv- ity is an ironic disguise. As Jonathan Culler puts it: "While we need not actually find in the verbal surface an assertion which runs counter to what our empirical knowledge would lead us to assert, we must at least detect, in the apparent disinterestedness of the text, a failure to assert what we take to be the appropriate judgment."3 The false impression that the views of the protagonist reflect those of the implied author stems from the subtle and often misleading technique of narrated monologue. This technique was not taken into consideration by the critics who asserted that Agnon's protagon- ists give expression to the predicaments of their circumstances.4 The assess- ment that harmony exists between the protagonist and his historical context is challenged by the desperation of deteriorating Shibbush and the senti- mental effusions of the protagonist in Guest in the Night ('Oreab nalah la-lun). Similarly, it is difficult to see the fastidiousness of the protagonist of Thus Far ('Ad hennah) who is concerned mostly with the comfort of his apartments as congruous with the bloodcurdling description of Germany during World War I. Is Isaac Kumer, who joins a fanatically orthodox and anti-Zionist sect in Jerusalem, representative of the halutzim described in Yesteryear (Temol shilshom)? In what follows we shall examine the dynamics of the ironic characterization, its impact and its various functions. 2. Jonathan Culler, Flaubert: The Uses of Uncertainty (Ithaca, 1974), p. 90. 3.

Ironic Characterization in The Bridal Canopy (Hakhnasat kallah) The discrepancy between reality and the protagonist's perception in The Bridal Canopy is dramatized by the trivialization of substantial problems on the one hand, and the exaggeration of peripheral and mostly theoretical problems on the other. Finding a proper match for Reb Yudel's three daughters is a problem which appears early in the novel. Reb Yudel's reac- tion to his wife's protests is characteristic: "The words entered into the heart of the Hasid and aroused his fatherly compassion. He sighed a bitter sigh, and returned to the Gemara, trusting in the Lord since everything was done by His will."' Reb Yudel's decision to procure a dowry for Pessele does not stem from recognizing the necessity of his intervention, but rather from his deference to the authority of the Zaddik of Apta, "for it is a misvah to heed the words of the wise."6 Reb Yudel is not moved by his daughter's plight, but by the allegorical interpretation of the talmudic saying, "If your daughter has come of age, release your slave." The text supersedes life; theory overrides reality. This pattern characterizes the protagonist's con- duct throughout the novel. Indulging himself in heavy meals and Hasidic tales, Reb Yudel often for- gets the goal of his journey and the desperation of his wife and daughters.7 Not only does he rarely recall his daughters' predicament, he also repeatedly misses ideal opportunities for a proper match.8 The most obtrusive ironic paralipsis finds expression in Reb Yudel's decision to settle in a luxurious hotel and to study the Torah, while progressively using up the money he had collected for his own daughter's dowry.9 Reb Yudel fails to take cognizance of the halakhic and ethical crime he is perpetrating by making use of money consecrated for a miSvah. The match which is finally effected between him and Reb Vovi is due to the curiosity and greed of Reb Lifa, the matchmaker, more than to his own intiative. On his meandering return to Brod, Reb Yudel makes no effort to regain the lost dowry. "He goes wherever his legs lead him"'o and feels neither guilt nor shame at his failure. On one of the rare occasions in which Reb Yudel recalls his family, he is 5. S. Y. Agnon, Hakhnasat kallah (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1964), p. 8.

"And since Reb Yudel remembered that rooster, he began to weep, lest Frumet did not stand the test and killed him."" His hungry family is evoked only by association to the rooster: "and as he remembered Reb Zerah, he remembered his family, whom he left without bread, clothes or shoes." The text itself does not offer explicit criticism of Reb Yudel's egocentri- city, which is presented by the unreliable narrator and the other characters as the epitome of piety and righteousness. The principal elements that con- trol the ironic process of characterization are the juxtaposition of scenes depicting the family's misery, on the one hand, and Reb Yudel's self- indulgence on the other."2 Reb Yudel's return to Brod does not narrow the gap between his naive optimism and the troublesome reality. He continues to spend most of his time in the studyhouse, often reflecting on his adven- tures and sharing favorite tales with others.'3 The numerous discrepancies between the Hasid's world and his world view are not merely a comic ploy. They serve, in fact, as a comprehensive and far-reaching satire on the Jewish ancestral community. What is present- ed in the narrative as a central problem, namely finding a match for Reb Yudel's daughters, is indicative of the structure of the Jewish community at large. The reader is told that the difficulties of the match stem from Reb Yudel's poverty. It is intimated that Reb Yudel's poverty is due to the fact that Reb Yudel, too busy serving his Lord, has no time to earn his own bread. The fact of the matter is, however, that during his voyage, Reb Yudel spends most of his time telling and listening to tales, which have very slight bearing on the Torah. The question which follows naturally is, Why does Reb Yudel not work for a living instead of traveling aimlessly for several months? Why does he prefer the collection of charity (a rather purposeless endeavor, since he squanders the money later) to respectable work? The question is implied by the text but never explicitly stated. It looms large especially in the scenes which describe Reb Yudel's admiration for manual laborers. The protagonist shows deep veneration for Reb Moses, the gold- smith,14 and for the old mud-digger,"5 but his veneration remains theoret- 11. Ibid., p. 202. 12.

He offers allegorical insights into different professions'6 and recounts laudatory tales on behalf of manual workers.'7 It never occurs to Reb Yudel that he can emulate the workers he admires so much and that he can or should translate his words into actions. The repercussions of this ironic incongruity transcend the specific story about Reb Yudel, implicating the East European ancestral value-system which stressed learning and under- rated economic independence. It is not the ancestral ideal of persistent Torah learning, but its false realization which is satirized in the novel. The central problem of the narrative, namely, the lack of propitious bridegrooms for Reb Yudel's daughters, raises a deeper problem: How is it possible that in a pious Jewish community, based on the principles of Torah, it is the economic status of the paterfamilias which determines the fate of his offspring, rather than his (and their) piety and righteousness? Reb Yudel's inability to marry off his daughters, despite his remarkable spiritual quali- ties, and despite the apparent reverence of the community, implies that a Jew is not judged by his learning or devoutness, but by the size of his pocket- book. The text makes no effort to explain this inconsistency, neither does it attempt to explain the fact that in a rich community like Brod, no Jews volunteered to help poor Reb Yudel in his predicament. The list of Brod's wealthy residents further exacerbates the problem: There were many wealthy men in Brod, like that true scholar and Gaon, Reb Zalman Margolius, and his brothers, the rich Reb Getzel and Reb Jacob, but Reb Yudel Nathansohn was wealthier than them all and his fame had even spread beyond Brod. ... . The text offers no explicit criticism of the gap which separated rich and poor in the community. The ironic omission of censure is most effective in the contexts which juxtapose Reb Yudel Nathansohn the millionaire, and Reb Yudel Nathansohn, the pauper.'9 The Hasid's self-presentation as Reb Yudel, the illustrious millionaire, explains Reb Vovi's eagerness to sign the marriage contract. The protagonist all but ignores the dubious ethical rami- fications of his ingenious deception. When Reb Vovi realizes his mistake, he reacts with much indignation, but his fury is not directed at the act of decep- 16. Ibid., p. 271. 17. Ibid., pp. 283-85. 18.

The problem which finds no verbal expression in the text is the exclusive- ness of the economic factor in determining social status in the community. Had the Hasid not disguised himself as the rich man he was not, and had the miracle of the treasure not occurred, the marriage contract would have been cancelled. The gap between rich and poor in the ancestral community could only be bridged through deception or supernatural intervention. The para- liptic treatment of this problem parodies the ancestral attitude which idealizes the Jewish community, unaware of the grave problems embedded within it. The ironic paralipsis is complemented by the gratuitous exaggeration of peripheral issues. The Rabbi of Apta is not troubled by the social and ethical problems, but by appearance and impressions. He attaches much impor- tance to Reb Yudel's appearance and helps him borrow a coach and proper garments-the insignia of social status. He also takes pains to affix rhymes to the sententious letter he writes on behalf of Reb Yudel. The excessive emphasis on these trivialities eclipses the more essential problem of social inequality. Reb Yudel explains his masquerading as a rich man as an attempt to evoke pity.2" The use of the guise of wealth as a means to induce commiseration, however, ridicules Reb Yudel's naivete and the commu- nity's social norms and conventions. The wealthy people of the community lend him respectable clothes. It never occurred to these "good, pious and upright" people to help Reb Yudel in a more substantial way, by collecting money for his daughter's dowry, for instance. The assistance is faulty because it treates the symptom, not the cause of the problem. The social and economic inequality in the ancestral community moti- vates the plots of most of the metadiegetic stories in the Bridal Canopy, like 20. Ibid., p. 390. 21. Ibid., p. 326.</page><page sequence="7">IRONIC CHARACTERIZATION IN S. Y. AGNON 107 "Solomon-Jacob's Bed" ("Mittato shel Shelomoh Ya'aqov") (the rich bride becomes available for a match with the poor protagonist because of her shady love affair with a gentile) and "Torah and Greatness" ("Torah u-gedullah") (the poor man gains the community's respect thanks to his marriage with the rich Reb Manish's daughter). All the metadiegetic stories, however, are presented by the narrator as celebrations of the Torah and Israel's piety. The incongruity between the ancestral ideal and the modeled reality cor- rodes the validity of the theological premises of the novel as well. The essen- tial problem of the suffering righteous appears in the narrative in different variations, but it is treated peripherally by both protagonist anI narrator. How much good Reb Yudel derived from his sleep! His limbs rested, he regained his mental balance and did not enter on unnecessary thoughts, for Reb Yudel was all but questioning, God forbid, the words of the sages who say in the Talmud that night was created only for sleep, and here he was un- able to fall asleep; also it was hard for him to understand why there are men who stay in one place all their lives and the Holy and Blessed One brings what they require to their own place, while he could not find his necessities in his own place but was compelled to travel to foreign parts. .. .22 The issue of providential justice is raised in the wake of the protagonist's sleeplessness. The irony is intensified by the logical solution to the trivial query, whereas the essential problem is further complicated by a sophistic, mystic pilpul: "And therefore he, Reb Yudel that is, must be one of those souls, derived from an out-of-place letter in a verse, and so he had to satisfy his needs by wandering far and wide."23 In other words, Reb Yudel's wan- derings are predetermined by a mystical link between his own soul and a cer- tain letter in the Torah. At this point, the protagonist ignores the fact that he had spent most of his life in his own town and had never been compelled to roam about prior to his present enterprise. Reb Yudel ascribes his suffering to a metaphysical order and avoids questioning this order. He is content to repeat the dogmatic theodicy and rejects the need to examine its validity: "And Reb Yudel said, 'His guidance, blessed be His name, is always done with justice, and righteousness and mercy, and there is no need for explana- 22. Ibid., p. 57 (Lask, pp. 58-59). 23. Ibid., (Lask, p. 59).</page><page sequence="8">108 ESTHER FUCHS tions by a mere human being, because the explanation is embedded in the guidance itself.' ,24 The protagonist never as much as questions his dogmatic belief in divine jus- tice, even when he encounters innocent people afflicted with famine and sickness (Reb Kalman, Reb Joshua Eleazar) or deceitful egotists blessed with incalculable affluence (Reb Israel Solomon, Reb Ephraim). The pious narrator never questions the validity of the social system which allows a rich and childless Reb Yudel to dwell beside a penniless Reb Yudel who can afford no dowry for his daughters. The irony intensifies in direct proportion to the dramatization of suffering: ... and a pile of rotting straw was there, and two sisters were lying on the straw and their eyes dancing with the madness of hunger. The sisters smelled the bread in his garment. One of them stood up and snatched the bread with her mouth. Her sister fell on her and brought her mouth to the other's mouth and took a bite of the same loaf, until her mouth hit the other's mouth, and her teeth the other's teeth.25 Reb Yudel's reaction to this scene is not one of revulsion or pity as one may expect; rather he is concerned about having to miss a chance to study a chapter of mishnayot on the eve of his mother's death. The halakhic problem eclipses the human tragedy. Not only does he fail to question the absolute justice of divine providence for inflicting meaningless suffering on human beings, but he uses this opportunity to offer more thanks to God and to eulogize Him: "Had a man known how to connect the events he would have realized that all is meant for the better . . . for the good of the Holy One, blessed be He, for had the Holy Blessed One not wanted it, it would not have been done."26 Reb Yudel's eagerness to justify his a priori ancestral conception locks him into a self-contradictory vicious circle, because the justification he adduces undermines the monotheistic belief in God's benevolence. A God who makes his creatures suffer "for His own good" is a self-serving and ruthless God and extremely different from the one Reb 24. Ibid. 25. Ibid., p. 267. 26.

The problem of unjust suffering prevails on the collective level as well: Wherever he went he wanted to know about the troubles which occurred there, since there was no town which was spared; but the troubles of each town were different from the troubles of the other .... Here they had been smitten at the hand of Ishmael, the Turk, and there by the hand of Chmelnitski, the Cossack, as told in the elegies. Saints that were as holy and pious as angels and seraphs perished that day; wealthy magnates and men of reputation suc- cumbed in their thousands for hunger and thirst; daughters were assaulted in the presence of their fathers, and sons were slaughtered in their mothers' bosoms; wives were raped in sight of their husbands and pregnant women ripped open with knives. And the Holy and Blessed One dips his royal purple cloak in the blood of the murdered souls of Israel till its color turns red.27 The description of the persecutions of innocent Jews undermines the doc- trine of divine providence and justice. Not for Reb Yudel, however. The protagonist, a staunch believer in collective and individual providence,28 avoids potential doubts by ignoring the problem. Reb Yudel perceives the historical accounts of the persecution of the Jews as legendary folktales, similarly to the way he perceives the factual life-stories of Paltiel the milk- man and Kalman the tailor.29 The inversion of fact and legend blunts the edge of the theological problem, but it does not close the gap between the reader's perception and the fallacious interpretation offered by both prota- gonist and narrator. The ironic effect is, in point of fact, amplified by the characters' imperviousness to the problems. The author attempts to create in the reader the proper reaction to the complex situation, eliciting at the same time a monochromatic attitude from the alazonic character.30 The Bridal Canopy does not deride and extol the protagonist simultaneously, as some would have it. Rather, the work ridicules the protagonist by pretend- ing to venerate him."3 27. Ibid., p. 272. 28. Ibid., p. 27. 29. Ibid., p. 344. 30. J. W.

The Narrated Monologue Many of Agnon's third person narratives use the technique of narrated monologue.32 The narrated monologue presents the conscious and sub- conscious activity of a character by employing the objective and impersonal third person. Though the formal transmission is auctorial, it reflects, in fact, a figural consciousness. The objective pose of the formal transmission manages to highlight the limitations, flaws and distortions of the figural consciousness by feigning neutrality, as Dorrit Cohn explains: "But no mat- ter how 'impersonal' the tone of the text that surrounds them, narrated monologues tend to commit the narrator to attitudes of sympathy or irony. Precisely because they cast the language of a subjective mind into the gram- mar of objective narration, they amplify emotional notes, but also throw into ironic relief all false notes struck by a figural mind."33 In Agnon, the principal clue to the distance between auctorial and figural points of view resides in the incongruity between the modeled context and the protagon- ist's simplistic and naive perception. One of the central thematic issues in "A Simple Story" ("Sippur pashut") deals with the social inequality in Shibbush (in Hebrew, "a flaw"). It is the economic gap between the spoiled Hirschel, son of middle class shopkeepers, and the impoverished Bluma, which undermines their roman- tic relationship. The obvious victim of the social corruption is Bluma, the poor orphan, shamelessly exploited and abused by her rich relatives, Hirschel's own parents. But Hirschel, the protagonist, is equally victimized by the system, embodied by his devious and materialistic mother, Tzirl. Tzirl plots to wean her son away from Bluma, and to substitute the rich Mina for the penniless maid, whom she unscrupulously expels from her house. By dramatizing Hirschel's concentration on trivialities, the narrated monologue exposes his imperviousness to the real cause for his suffering. In the next scene, Hirschel, oblivious to the true causes of Bluma's depression, ascribes it to her willfulness: He suddenly saw her. Her face was changed. Her lower lip was drawn into her 32. An excellent article on the subject is Harai Golomb, "The Combined Speech in Agnon's Prose" [Hebrew], Hasifrut 1 (1968): 378-85. 33.

God in Heaven knows that he is blameless.34 The "battles" Hirschel "fights" for Bluma, however, remain wishful reflec- tions and plans. Even when defense is called for, Hirschel remains mute vis- a-vis the insidious comments of Tzirl. During their encounter in the wine cellar, Tzirl reminds her son that Bluma is poor, and therefore unworthy of him. Instead of resisting, "Hirschel stood still ... his hands limp." The character's actions do not corroborate his views of himself. The ironic characterization of Hirschel differs from that of the secondary characters (Tzirl, Baruch Meir, Mina, Berta) and the caricatures (Tauber, Sheinberd, Kurtz) in degree, not in quality. Both the main and the secon- dary characters serve as satire on the bourgeois conventions of the Eastern European Jewish community of the beginning of the twentieth century. The complex political background of Shirah operates as the major vehicle in the ironic characterization of Manfred Herbst, the protagonist. The Nazi threat in Europe, the Arab-Jewish conflict and the oppression of the British Mandate in Palestine of the 1930s operate as the three main foci in the referential context. These problems receive considerable attention from secondary characters in the novel. Henrietta is busy ensuring immigra- tion certificates for her relatives in Germany who are seeking refuge in Palestine. Tamara joins the underground, and Zohara works on a kibbutz. The complacent professor, however, indulges himself in a mostly theoretical love affair and busies himself with his uninspiring academic work. It should be noted that, in both the erotic and the academic spheres, he is concerned with superficialities. Though obsessed by Shira, he never stops to consider the true nature of his attraction to her, and its impact on his own family. Herbst is equally untroubled by his motivation to pursue scholarship, which is based on competitiveness and fear rather than on intellectual curiosity. The elderly professor is far more concerned with appearances than essences. The scenes describing the encounters between Shira and Herbst are usually framed by references to the unsettled political reality of the period. During his second encounter with Shira, a curfew is imposed.3 On his way back from Shira's house, after their third reunion, Herbst comes across his colleague, Taglicht, who is returning from an underground training ses- 34.

On the contrary, he uses the traumatic events as alibis with which to allay his wife's suspicions. Herbst and Taglicht did not prolong their talk;... they parted and went their separate ways. Taglicht, happy with the new settlement which was recently established, and Herbst with the excuse he found through Taglicht.39 The ideological and political involvement of Taglicht, and other characters, emphasizes by contrast the complacent solipsism of the protagonist, and the repeated "coincidental" encounters with political reality, throw into relief the absurdity of Herbst's egocentricity. The implied author, who apparently refrains from any evaluation or criticism, is parodying the hero's apolitical and amoral attitude. By pushing it ad absurdum, he exposes the hero's neutrality as self-deluding. The objective descriptiveness which characterizes the novel, does not reflect the author's empathy, as some would have it.40 At play is a subtle manipulation of the ironic potential of the narrated monologue, which exposes the objectivity as false. In addition to scenic dramatization and characterological foils, the text mobilizes internal contradictions and fallacious reasoning to point out the dubious validity of the protagonist's self-perception: What does it mean? He does not wish to go to her. Indeed he dotes on her at all times, but he is not in control of his thoughts whereas he does control his legs, and as long as he controls them, he keeps them at home. Though, had he gone to Shira, he and his conscience would be innocent, for if a wife does not consent to her husband he is permitted to do as he pleases.41 36. Ibid., p. 118. 37. Ibid., p. 269. 38.

AGNON 113 The epigram included in the causal subordinate clause, which concludes this protracted and convoluted sentence, is presented as an objective narrative statement. Presumably, it reflects the author's attitude. But who maintains that a wife's sexual inaccessibility justifies the husband's search for other women-the author or the protagonist? A possible clue can be found in the syntactic awkwardness of the above quoted sentence, whose structure undercuts its semantic signification. The complex sentence consists of six clauses. The syntactic complexity increases progressively, culminating in the final conditional clause, which includes concessive and causal subordinate clauses. The hypotactic structure underlines the questionable logic of the reasoning. The logical distortion is most obtrusively expressed by the inter- nal contradiction between the opening and closing propositions. The former indicates that the protagonist does not wish to see Shira, whereas the latter implies the opposite.42 The excessive repetitiveness transposes the reader's attention from the semantic to the syntactic, from meaning to medium, thereby implying that instead of cogent reasoning, the hero manipulates words in order to disguise his questionable integrity. By retaining a neutral pose, the implied author pretends to accept the dubious excuse as valid justi- fication. In another context, Herbst rationalizes his erotic urge as social commit- ment: A man cannot forego visiting the city every single night. [He should visit the city] because he wishes to speak with a friend who dwells in the city or because of another reason. Many are the reasons, and the most important reason is that it is not good to keep away from the community, for if one keeps away from the community, the community keeps away from him.43 Herbst's discomfiture at the presence of his friends makes it hard to accept as genuine his sudden interest in the city community. His general indiffer- ence to the predicaments of his society makes the pretext he uses to visit Shira become all the more transparent. Syntactically, the repetition of causal clauses and conjunctives exposes the speciousness of all the "reasons." Herbst's reluctance to confront the essential problems underlying his 42.

Shirah, p. 97.</page><page sequence="14">114 ESTHER FUCHS academic career is assisted by a similar strategy of evasion. His work is repeatedly described in technical rather than intellectual terms.44 The text prefers pens (often confused with cigarettes) and notes to ideas: For often he copies things which he already copied, because the notes are con- fused and it is difficult to verify what he did or did not copy. Likewise, at times he finds something worth copying but does not copy it because he thinks he already copied it, and later when he checks the notes he realizes that he did not copy it. And if he wishes to copy it, he either does not find the book or does not find the subject.45 The repetition of the verb "to copy" discloses the reproductive tedium and futility of Herbst's activity, not only his amusing absentmindedness.46 Pro- fessor Manfred Herbst, like his colleagues in the academic pantheon, judges and is judged by quantitative output rather than quality.47 The obsessive concern for details prevents the hero from a more substantial critical evalua- tion of the historical period he specializes in. His comprehensive book on "all the instruments in the Church of Sophia in Byzantium during the reign of Leo the Heretic" does not mention the persecutions of the Jews, for one thing, under Leo's rule.48 If his objectivity toward the history he investigates can be defended in the name of scholarship, the identical attitude he demon- strates toward his own time exposes an unforgivably self-centered indiffer- ence. In both cases, the fastidious concern with bagatelles eclipses the sub- stantial problems involved, leading to a superficial and largely distorted worldview. Underlying this mode of characterization is Agnon's use of para- lipsis, not his complete identification with Herbst.49 44. Ibid., pp. 145, 232, 314, 358, 359, 532. 45. Ibid., p. 200. 46.

Baruch Hochman criticizes the author for avoiding examination of the meaning of criti- cal issues: "Agnon, for all his mockery of Herbst, seems so closely identified with him that he does not want to probe the meaning of his experience. So deep is his identification with Herbst that he seems to lose perspective on the issues that arise in the course of Herbst's presentation."

AGNON 115 The caricaturization of other academics uses paraliptic devices as well. In the case of Wechsler, the technical process of research is emphasized at the expense of its scientific merit. The title of Weltfremd's pamphlet, "Seventeen Principal Reasons Why We Absolutely Object to the Nomina- tion of Plato as Lecturer of Philosophy in any University, Especially those in Germany," is yet another example of the way in which paralipsis generates satire. Essentially, Herbst is not different from Wechsler who "selects amulets and seals and titles and classifies them in files and lets Hitler kill the Jews, and lets the Jews save themselves."50 But, whereas the satiric treat- ment of the professorial caricatures is meant to criticize academic opportun- ism, the ironic characterization ridicules the sterile intelligence, which burrows its way through trivia, untroubled by external turmoil and deeper issues. The referential background of "Betrothed" ("Shevu'at 'emunim") is the second 'Aliyah, but the protagonist Rechnitz, resembles Herbst in his abso- lute obliviousness to the social combustibility of his time and in his single- minded pursuit of his research on seaweeds. Rechnitz settles in Jaffa for professional reasons, in contradistinction to idealists like Yehiel Luria and Boris Heilpern. When offered a position in America, he leaves Jaffa with no hesitation or compunction. His indifference to his social environment parallels the insensitivity he demonstrates toward Shoshana, the childhood playmate he vowed to marry. He is equally unaware of the unease of the old consul, his benefactor, the yearnings of his six girl friends, and his parents, whom he visits on professional trips only.5' The ironic function of the nar- rated monologue is particularly effective in contexts where the trivial is pre- sented as colossal and vice versa: ". .. so he jumped off his bed and took a bowl of cold water, and dipped his head in it, washed, and shaved his beard. And Asclepius, the God of Health, protected him from wounding his chin or cutting his skin."52 Jacob Rechnitz does not invoke Asclepius's assistance in more consequential situations, especially those relating to the mysterious ill- ness of Shoshana. The discrepant insertion of a transcendental factor into a quotidian context signals an ironic distance between the auctorial and figural points of view.53 The protagonist's tendency to ascribe outcomes to 50.

For additional examples of the same technique, see ibid., pp. 288, 291.</page><page sequence="16">116 ESTHER FUCHS the will of the gods also illustrates his reluctance to take responsibility for his own actions.54 The often desultory structure and inconsistent logic of the narrated monologue supplies us with yet another ironic clue: And although she told her father [about them], it is doubtful if he understood the matter. Jacob did not find the opportunity to discuss the affair with Sho- shana with Shoshana's father. And he was pleased with this for he was afraid the consul might observe his deeds. Just as he found no opportunity to talk with him, so he found no way to talk with her. Shoshana did not evade him, but she did not seem content with him.55 She did not give him an excuse to talk.56 The numerous excuses the hero mobilizes for his defense intimate that his lack of communication with Shoshana and her father does not stem from their inaccessibility but from his own reluctance to confront them. The hypotactic structure of the excuses in this passage undermines their own validity. The more detailed and circumstantial the rationalization, the clearer the psychological mechanism of the hero's evasiveness becomes. The ironic dialogue constitutes another frequent feature in Agnon's characterizations. The ironic dialogue focuses on peripheral issues, cau- tiously avoiding the central problem which troubles the interlocutors.57 In "Betrothed" this technique appears most frequently in Jacob's dialogues with the consul and Shoshana: Jacob added, "At this very moment I was thinking of a certain taxidermist. His name is Arzaf. I am not saying that this bird can read thoughts; neverthe- less it is a wonder, that just as I was thinking of Arzaf, the parrot screamed 'Pferflucht.' "Achzav?" "Yes, Arzaf." Said Shoshana to Jacob, "You told me yesterday that you exchanged the flowers your girl friends gave you for me 54. It seems to me that the repeated invocation of the gods does not justify the allegorical- theosophical interpretation endorsed by Abraham Kariv, Dina Stern and Hillel Barzel. The function of the gods in the novella is mainly ironic, and there is nothing in the operation of this motif to suggest that the other characters in the story signify allegorical entities (e.g., the con- sul = God; Rechnitz = Israel, etc.). 55. Literally, "she did not show him a content countenance." 56. 'Adhennah, p. 275. 57. See Yosef Even's "Ha-di'alog be-sippurei S. Y. Agnon ve-darkhei 'i$Suvo," Hasifrut 3(1971): 281-94.

Why did you exchange the flowers? .. ." "Because I found others, nicer ones." Said Shoshana, "This stands to reason. I see that you can not answer now. Perhaps you will another time. What is the name of that taxi- dermist from Ein Rogel?" Said Jacob, "Arzaf is his name." Shoshana opened her eyes and said, "Yes, yes Achzav." Said Jacob, "What does Arzaf have to do with this?" Said Shoshana, "Since you mentioned him, I wanted to know his name. Now that I know, you do not have to mention him again.""5 Only at one point does the dialogue touch, albeit indirectly, on the troubled relationship of the interlocutors, when Jacob is asked about the flowers he brought for Shoshana. Embarrassed by his own deception, and by the fact that his gift for her was donated by his own girl friends, Jacob makes no reply. The tedious conversation which opens with Arzaf, a safe and neutral subject, concludes with a discussion of his name. Shoshana's repeated, mistaken pronunciation of the taxidermist's name dramatizes her lack of attentiveness to Jacob's words and the general breakdown in their mutual communication. Focusing on the irrelevant taxidermist constitutes a para- liptic shift of emphasis from center to periphery.59 Unlike Rechnitz, who uses his work to escape from Shoshana, Hemdat, of "The Sand Dune" ("Giv'at ha-bol") avails himself of his artistic pursuit to win the heart of the lovely but elusive Yael Hayot. Hemdat, however, is not conscious of the libidinal urges which underlie his altruism. He tries to convince himself and others that his interest in Yael is platonic, selfless, and motivated by "his pity for her."60 The self-delusion is exposed, however, by the narrated monologues. For example: She usually arrives between five and six. Again she is late. Would that she did not come at all. It would be nice of her. He wants to work and she does not let him. She takes up his best hours. Perhaps he should stop instructing her.... Why is she not coming? Just when he wishes to see her, he does not see her. If she stopped taking lessons from him, the night would be lonely. Some days he can hardly get up, and some days he washes up only for her. It is already six and Yael has not come.6' The concluding sentences resoundingly belie Hemdat's pretended equa- 58. 'Ad hennah, p. 269. 59.

Ibid., p. 365.</page><page sequence="18">118 ESTHER FUCHS nimity. The emotional tension beneath the rationalized composure is reflect- ed in the paratactic structure. Despite his rational decision to the contrary, Hemdat hastens to visit Yael that very night. Similarly, Isaac Kumer of Yesteryear (Temol shilshom) deludes himself that the flirtatious Sonia, who enjoys his company occasionally, is seriously involved with him. Desperate not to come to terms with reality, he invents a wealth of excuses to explain Sonia's apparent indifference. Perhaps she is ill, for after all, had she been well would she not have come. Sonia is ill, Sonia is ill.... Sonia is not ill, Sonia is not ill, Sonia is not ill.... On the contrary Sonia is healthy, Sonia is healthy, and she sits waiting for me.62 In contrast to Isaac's expectations, Sonia did not "stretch out her arms to embrace him."63 The irony of events dramatizes poignantly the incommen- surability of Isaac's perception and reality. Despite Sonia's coldness, however, he determines to propose to her.64 Even after they stop corre- sponding, Isaac believes that their relationship needs to be clarified and, consequently, travels back to Jaffa in order "to speak clearly."'6 Isaac's romantic blindness is paralleled in his ideology. Isaac, who emi- grates to Palestine as a halutz, determined to break with the Jewish diaspora, ends up joining an anti-Zionist religious sect supported by East- European communities. Like Hirschel, Herbst, Jacob Rechnitz, and Hemdat, Isaac concentrates on pedestrian issues, consistently avoiding larger principles. The secondary character of Menahem, representing both genuine religiosity and the halutz ideal of the cultivation of the soil, serves as a foil to Isaac Kumer in the same way that the truly dedicated artist, Blaukopf, sets off the opportunism of Kumer, who resorted to painting by necessity, rather than by choice. But what, more than anything else in the novel, emphasizes Isaac's excessive concern with inconsequential trivialities and his lack of self-consciousness is Balak, the dog, who, in contrast to the human protagonist, is deeply con- cerned with ethics and metaphysics. The canine philosopher is obsessed by etiology and teleology, the meaning of life, cosmic justice and his own iden- 62. S. Y. Agnon, Temolishilshom (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1964), p. 161. 63. Ibid., p. 142. 64. Ibid., p. 153. 65. Ibid., p. 365.</page><page sequence="19">IRONIC CHARACTERIZATION IN S. Y. AGNON 119 tity. To a certain extent, Balak satirizes the anthropocentric world view and the general tendency of homo sapiens to philosophize in vacuo and establish generalities based on meager evidence and limited experience. Balak's obses- sion with eternal truths underlines the opposite tendency in Kumer: to ignore principles and submit to vicissitudes in the name of survival. In contrast to Yesteryear, whose diegetic time spans a few years, "Meta- morphosis" ("Panim 'aherot") presents a single afternoon in the life of Toni and Hartman, following their divorce. Whereas the novel can use large plot structures to dramatize the incongruity of consciousness and reality (such as purposeless wanderings, coincidental encounters and repeated errors), the story must accomplish this objective in a limited space. It therefore uses absent-minded and mechanical gestures in order to convey the same: "Once again Hartman felt the need to do something. Not knowing what to do, he removed his hat, mopped his brow, wiped the leather band inside his hat, and put it back on his head."66 Hartman's involuntary motions and stealthy looks insinuate what is never fully expressed in dialogue, his renewed attractions to his former wife. Hartman's conversation reflects a studied effort not to broach the subject of divorce. He talks and thinks about different events from his past but never about his immediate dilemma. Coming across a mound, he climbs it and is overcome by an irrational fear: He imagined himself back in the same situation, and began to be afraid he would fall; no, it was rather a wonder he had not already slipped to the bot- tom. And if he had not already slipped and fallen, he was bound to do so; although there was no real danger of his falling, his fear itself would make him fall; though he was still on his feet, his legs were beginning to give way and slip, he would roll down, his bones would get broken.67 The reader would expect such emotional intensity in conjunction with Hart- man's divorce. This problem merits the dread and distress that Hartman experiences over a small and completely harmless mound. This incident, however, dramatizes Hartman's usual manner of coping with reality; he seems to attend to trivialities and flinch from real problems. The irrational dread inspired by the small mound dramatizes the paraliptic displacement. 66. 'Al kappot ha-man'ul, p. 452. Based on "Metamorphosis," trans. I. Schem, in S. Y. Agnon, Twenty One Stories, ed. Nahum Glatzer (New York, 1970), p. 114. 67. Ibid., p. 467 ("Metamorphosis," p. 132).</page><page sequence="20">120 ESTHER FUCHS It becomes clear that the cause of divorce stems from Hartman's own para- noia and phobias, here embodied by an innocuous mound. Hartman's incongruous reaction is emphasized by the hypotactic structure of the nar- rated monologue, stressing the logical inconsistency of his thought process. The ironic effect increases in direct proportion to the pervasiveness of the avoided problem. In the majority of Agnon's narratives, the problem is adumbrated in the beginning and grows progressively obtrusive as the pro- tagonist's obliviousness to the problem increases. Helena of "The Lady and the Peddlar" ("Ha-'Adonit ve-ha-rokhel") is not immediately identified as the vampire she is. The possibility that she murdered her own husband is tentatively suggested, however, by her certainty that her husband's killers will never be found.68 The reader's suspicions are confirmed by Helena's candid admission of her cannibalistic predilection.69 Joseph, her Jewish boarder, interprets her confession as a jocular speech style, and remains in Helena's house until she assaults him with a knife in his sleep. The protagon- ist is much slower than the reader in deciphering the problem. It is the time lag between the reader's and the hero's realizations that creates the strong dramatic irony in the story.70 In "Edo and Enam," the dilemma which obsesses Gamzu and motivates his actions becomes clear to the mystified witness-narrator (and to the reader) only toward the end of the story. Gamzu's volubility covers every- thing from the exotic places he visited to the curative power of charms and the mystical allusions of puzzling verses in the Torah and the Midrash. He makes no reference to the true cause of his nightly visits at the house of Greifenbachs, presenting them as mere coincidences. That the orthodox scholar is in pursuit of his wife, who abandons him nightly for her beloved Ginat, becomes evident in Gamzu's violent exchange with the lovers and in his subsequent abduction of his own wife. The main clue to the distance between the implied author and the protagonist, prior to this dramatic scene, can be found in the run-on sentences and cumbersome syntax of the reported monologues:7 68. S. Y. Agnon, Samukh ve-nir'eh (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1964), p. 95. 69. Ibid., p. 96. 70. Even if we concede the allegorical interpretation construing the lady as the Christians and Joseph as the Jews, we must not overemphasize the substitutive elements at the expense of the structural relationship between them, which creates suspense, dramatic irony, and irony of events and which underlies the ironic characterization of the protagonist. 71. Note that reported rather than narrated monologue is the central ironic vehicle in this story.</page><page sequence="21">IRONIC CHARACTERIZATION IN S. Y. AGNON 121 Then Gamzu sat and rolled himself a cigarette and talked about the magic properties of charms, whose virtue is superior to that of drugs, for the drugs we find mentioned in ancient books cannot, for the most part, be relied on, since the ways both of nature and of man have changed and with these changes the effect of the drugs too has altered. But charms have undergone no change and still retain their first nature and condition, because they are yoked together with stars, and the stars remain just as they were on the day when they were first hung in the firmament, and their influence is observed on all creatures, and especially on man, for according to the star of his nativity, such is a man's character and fate, as it is said in the Talmud, "All depends upon one's star," and it is said, "Our star makes wise or makes us rich."72 Gamzu's drawling monologues are redolent with internal contradic- tions, misrepresentations and fallacious reasoning. In another monologue, he will confirm the opposite of his present statement, namely that drugs are more efficient than charms and that charms are merely obsolete drugs. The pleonastic style, hypotactic structure and long-windedness of the monologues contribute to the ironic self-betrayal. The paraliptic presenta- tion of the protagonist's consciousness peaks at the concluding scene at the cemetery. Instead of expressing grief over the tragic suicide of Ginat and Gemula, Gamzu informs the narrator of his recent discovery.73 Many critics have missed the irony in the story. Some have presented Gamzu as a tragic hero and a symbol of traditional Jewry. Consequently, the story was interpreted as an ideological manifesto bemoaning the fate of traditional Judaism and criticizing secular Zionism.74 The characterization of Adiel Amzeh, the obsessed historian of "For- evermore" (" 'Ad 'olam"), is based on a similar technique. Though satirized by the long-winded conversations with Gumlidata's sacred dogs75 and by the preciosities of his research, it is only at the end of the story that the para- lipsis reaches its fullest effect. Only at this point does it become clear that Amzeh's resolution to join a leprosarium in order to complete his research is not "tragic" or "heroic," but ridiculous. Most critics maintain that Amzeh constitutes a tragic hero. Gabriel Moked lists Amzeh's lofty properties in a 72. 'Ad hennah, p. 360. Based on Two Tales by S. Y. Agnon, trans. Walter Lever (New York, 1966), pp. 170-71. 73. 'Ad hennah, p. 394. 74. See Meshulam Tukhner, Pesher 'Agnon (Ramat Gan, 1968), p. 112 and Kurzweil, Massot, p. 148. 75. S. Y. Agnon, Ha-'esh ve-ha-'esim (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1952), p. 319.</page><page sequence="22">122 ESTHER FUCHS book-size eulogy appropriately entitled The Praises of Adiel Amzeh.76 Amzeh does not join the lepers from altruistic or humanistic motives but in order to peruse the pus-covered history book of Gumlidata. In the lepro- sarium, he sheds tears for the anonymous historian of Gumlidata, complete- ly ignoring the more immediate suffering of the lepers around him. Ironical- ly, the historicity of the ancient book becomes questionable, in view of its pragmatic purpose: to impress King Alaric, Gumlidata's relentless enemy. Far from being a reliable source of unbiased facts, the book for which Amzeh risks his life contains the official propaganda of a city in siege. However, Amzeh seeks in this dubious source not substantive answers or essential insights but a mere technical detail: "From which side entered the bands of Gediton, the hero, from the big bridge . . or circuitously from the valley of Afredat."77 The details with which Amzeh is concerned underscore his senseless monomania. Several critics contend that Gumlidata simul- taneously represents Jewish tradition, the biblical city of Samaria and modern Judaism78 and that furthermore this ancient book symbolizes the Bible.79 In their view, therefore, Amzeh is a serious, dedicated and admir- able scholar,80 fit to symbolize the entire Jewish people. Excessive attention to the allegorical aspect of the research obscures its larger, ironic underpin- nings. The ironic effect depends to a large extent on the complexity of the characterization. It will approach the tragic if the causes of the protagonist's misperception are convincing. However, if the perceptional distortion is gra- tuitous, the character becomes a caricature, thus producing a comic effect. This is the case in the "Book of the State" ("Sefer ha-medinah"), populated with one-dimensional caricatures: their misperceptions do not stem from any rational causes. In "The Orange Peel" ("Qelippat tappualh ha-zahav"), the central problem is clearly the public nuisance generated by the orange peel which had been thrown into the street.8' The different solutions offered 76.

AGNON 123 by the caricatures (e.g., secure insurance policy against peels, contribute to real estate funds) are absurd because they complicate the problem needlessly by disregarding the simplest and most straightforward solution: the removal of the peel. The only one who takes this logical route is castigated and pena- lized by a policeman. The caustic satire on governmental heavy-handedness and bureaucratic inanity uses essentially the same paraliptic technique encountered in Agnon's novels, but it does so in a much more exaggerated manner. The central problem here is clearly contrasted with the inadequate responses and dogmatic solutions of the caricatures. b. The Personal-Subjective Narrative The objective pose of the third-person narrative serves as an effective mask for the implied narrator, whose very act of suppressing critical evalua- tions underscores the protagonist's weaknesses. However, the first-person narrative, though personal and subjective in tone, is equally effective as ironic vehicle. This may be seen in the characterization of Hemdat, the pro- tagonist of "Young and Old Together" ("Bi-ne'areinu u-vi-zeqeneinu"), Tirzah of "In the Flower of Her Youth" ("Bi-demi yameha"), and the pro- nominal "I" in Guest for the Night ('Oreah natah la-lun) and The Book of Deeds (Sefer ha-ma'asim). One of the most efficient techniques for demonstrating the inappro- priate perceptions of the protagonist-narrator of "Young and Old Together" is based on his laudatory presentation of caricatures such as Deiksil (in Hebrew, "rather foolish" [dei kesil]), Dr. Davidson, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Notkis, to name only a few. Deiksil's ignorance, opportunism, and arrogance are exposed in his vacuous sententiousness and pompous ver- bosity. Though he has no knowledge of Hebrew, he finds it necessary to express his opinion about the proper pronunciation of Hebrew.82 Moreover Deiksil, the leader of the Zionist Student Organization, prefers to eulogize Great Britain instead of proclaiming the value of the Land of Israel.83 Hemdat, however, enthralled by his idol, sees in Deiksil's ostentatious per- formance an undeniable proof for the latter's superiority. The protagonist considers social activities, such as contributions for the National Fund, subscriptions to Zionist papers, discussions and parties, as 82. 'Al kappot ha-man'ul, p. 312. 83. Ibid., p. 311.</page><page sequence="24">124 ESTHER FUCHS authentic manifestations of commitment to Zionism. However, emigration to the Land of Israel is never even mentioned in the satire. The apotheosis of his own contribution to Zionism is, according to Hemdat, his article on the Pitshiritz soirees: "I too was rewarded, for my letter about the party in Pitshiritz was published in our national paper, and it was printed on the very sheet on which appeared the picture of our Dr. David Davidson."84 The nar- rator's naive self-indulgent attitude was construed by several critics as the author's point of view. In some instances, Hemdat was identified with Agnon himself.85 The satiric function of the ironic characterization is not only directed at the Zionist leadership in Europe, or the Jewish community's decadence, but also at the naive conception of Zionism as theory rather than practice, as an ideal to be upheld rather than realized. Another limited consciousness is presented by the pronominal protagon- ist-narrator of Guest for the Night. He returns to Shibbush in order to reconstruct a no longer existent world and to rehabilitate its citizens.86 The guest's return to Shibbush is doomed to failure, because history cannot be reversed; neither can the disastrous effects of World War I be relieved by his charity or goodwill. The ironic treatment of most characters in the novel is based largely on their refusal to reckon with the fact that Eastern Europe no longer offers a realistic alternative for Jewish existence. The repeated metadiegetic plots dramatizing the wretched socioeconomic state of the local Jews87 and the variations on the theme of sickness, disability and death88 demonstrate the progressive degeneration of the community. Against such background the fastidious concern of the protagonist with his personal "problems" appears jarring. He is troubled by his winter coat, the deteriorating quality of the hotel's meals, a key he had lost, and the inadequate heating at the synago- gue.89 Even more ridiculous are the guest's efforts to redeem the dying com- 84. Ibid., p. 349. 85. According to Arnold Band, Hemdat indeed represents the young Agnon prior to his immigration to Palestine: "So highly personal was this attempt at satire, that Agnon could not keep it within the bounds of objective treatment."

AGNON 125 munity by tending to symptoms (supply heat for the synagogue, take charge of the synagogue's key, give occasional alms), rather than reckoning with the essential ailment. The few glasses of water he clumsily pours on the fire further expose the helplessness of the community as well as his own incompetence. The protagonist deals with each problem separately (the poverty of Sara and Freida, the tragedy of Daniel, the deaths of Enoch and Reb Haim) with no attempt to seek their common cause. It is this disjunc- tive perception which the text ironizes, referentially alluding to the ostrich- like wishful psychology of interbellum European Jewry.90 In addition to the social aspect of the sacrifice function, one should note the theological one. The protagonist's futile efforts to underplay these theo- logical problems only underscore their complexity. Unlike Elimelech Kaiser and Daniel Bach who pull no punches in protesting against God's indiffer- ence to his afflicted people, the guest offers pious consolations and repeated theodicies: All that the Holy One, blessed be He, did in His world He did well, and after He completed all his work, He endowed men with wisdom to make a pattern like the one above. He created a sun to give heat in the summer, and gave men the wisdom to make an oven to keep them warm in the winter days.9' What the protagonist-narrator omits in this pious eulogy is the fact that the synagogue oven had been ineffectual prior to his arrival, because, the "wis- dom" which God grants human beings must be complemented by financial means. This theodicy seems to fail the narrator when the corpses of Enoch and his horse are found in the snow.92 Despite God's wisdom, and the wis- dom He had imparted to man, a devout and innocent man lost his life in the freezing cold.93 Similar aspects are satirically probed in Thus Far ('Ad hennah) whose referential context is World War I Germany. Hans Trotzmiller, the son of the narrator's hotelkeeper can barely function upon his return from war. 90. Employing an entirely different critical methodology, Yair Mazor reaches a similar con- clusion concerning the preponderance of "Eretz Israel" as a countervailing theme to the idea of "galut" in the novel. See his book Ha-Dinamiqah shel motivim bi-yeSirot 'Agnon (Tel Aviv, 1979), pp. 68-71. 91. 'Oreah nalah la-lun, p. 114. 92. Ibid., p. 241.

For another dubious theodicy, see ibid., p. 192.</page><page sequence="26">126 ESTHER FUCHS Yosef Bach's brother-in-law and the sons of Mr. Lichtenstein, Dr. Mittel and Heschel Schor are killed in the war.94 Economic deterioration and social demoralization are coefficients of the war which seem to hurt the Jewish sector in particular. This tragic context sets off the narrator-protagonist's solipsism, dramatized most strikingly by his single-minded pursuit of more comfortable apartments. His daily encounters with the destructiveness of the raging war do not diminish his plaintiveness.95 The trivial problem in the auctorial framework becomes the paramount concern of the figural con- sciousness. For the protagonist reality is measured by needs alone. The traumatic return of Hans to his family inspires in him nothing but self-pity about the room he must vacate.96 Similarly, when his housing situation is satisfactorily resolved, he presumes that everybody's dilemmas are happily concluded: I give praise for the events which befall man to his harm, for in the end they turn out for his good. Go and see how many adventures this man has experi- enced. Since the sorrows multiplied, God took pity on him, and delivered him and brought him back to his own place, to the Land [of Israel].97 This optimistic conclusion stems from the solution of the narrator's own problem, which has little bearing on the general scheme of things. The jar- ring discrepancy between the narrator's conclusion, and the tragic implica- tions of the narrative ridicule the pious naivete of the protagonist- narrator. Though gravely harmed by the war, none of the characters retract their patriotic commitment to Germany. They all see the war as a historical necessity and a noble cause.98 The satiric effect is most caustic when dis- played in a Jewish context, since the Jews in the novella are shown to be vic- timized by the war as well as by German antisemitism. It is difficult to find full-fledged characterizations in the Book of Deeds since, like the Book of the State, this work displays caricatures rather than "round" characters. The central figure is presented as a pronominal "I," who functions as narrator. All expositional matter concerning the character 94. 'Ad hennah, pp. 64, 84, 93, 95, 99. 95.

AGNON 127 is omitted, and most of the reader's knowledge about him is confined to whatever is disclosed by the immediate narrative situation. The personal- subjective narrative led critics to identify the fictional "I" with S. Y. Agnon himself.99 It seems to me, however, that the omission of the exposition does not reflect the author's private experiences; rather it serves less as psycholo- gical reflector than ideational indicator. It dramatizes the absurd experi- ences of the "I" as the universal predicament of everyman. The incongruity of human capabilities and the perplexing vicissitudes of life are the subjects of these grotesques. The inadequacy of the human perception is emphasized by the ironic paralipsis: the "I" takes the trivial as colossal, while extra- ordinary phenomena are treated as pedestrian trivialities. The hero of "A Whole Loaf" ("Pat shelemah") fluctuates between two alternatives, perceived by him to be of equal and utmost importance; should he first go to the post office and mail Dr. Ne'eman's letters or should he give priority to his hunger and go to the restaurant first? The discrepancy between the protagonist's desperation and the triviality of the dilemma underlie the ironic effect of the story. This element was missed by those who identified the figural point of view as auctorial, and those who attempted to harmonize the discordance which is crucial to the structure grotesque.'00 "A Whole Loaf," like most other grotesques in the Book of Deeds, was present- ed as the dramatization of the nightmarish modern-secular pole in Agnon as opposed to the nostalgic harmony presumed to characterize his ancestral stories.'0' Consequently, the universal grotesques unjustly became domesti- cated as Jewish didactic parables, at the expense of Agnon's relentless irony. Summary The exclusive or predominant concern with peripheral issues (paralepsis) complemented by a persistent evasion of pivotal problems (paralipsis) con- stitutes Agnon's basic mode of characterization. It distinguishes the an- cestral-pious hero, as well as the modern-secular one. It prevails in the 99. According to Dov Sadan, the value of these stories consists in what they authentically reveal about the "inner depth of the author's soul". See his book, Massot u-ma'amarim 'al S. Y. Agnon (Tel Aviv, 1978), p. 59. 100. Structural cacophany, incongruities and textual inconstancies are formative in the grotesque. See, for example, Philip Thomson, The Grotesque (London, 1972). 101.

Despite the similar structure, the ironic technique produces different effects and performs different func- tions in various works. The ironic distance between the auctorial and figural points of view is also subject to fluctuation, often in the same work, but the crucial implications of the ironic characterization for the work in its totality are the same in all of Agnon's narratives. It is also important to note that the fictional protagonists do not automatically present psychological or ideological reflectors of the author's personality, but rather aesthetic enti- ties fashioned by the author and designed to perform specific functions. The creation of the fictional character is bound by an aesthetic truth rather than by factual, historical or biographical details. Consequently, the one who refuses to deal with the modeled reality is not Agnon, "whose stomach" is supposedly "too sensitive,"'02 but the protagonist who is satirized by the author for his lack of self-consciousness.

To argue with a writer on these grounds - especially of Agnon's stature - is to argue dire issues. It is to say that in the final accounting, Agnon sidesteps the harshest and most meaning- ful confrontations of all." See Fiction of S. Y. Agnon, p. 189.</page></plain_text>
