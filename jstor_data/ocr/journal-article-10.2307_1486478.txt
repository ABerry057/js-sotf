ALTSCHULER worship in public, Jews encountered in the New World few legal impediments to freedom, peace, and prosperity. It was rarely easy, and there were many Jews without money, but Jewish Americans have compiled a remarkable, perhaps unequaled, record of success. In its own way, American hospitality has brought a new meaning to the phrase shver zu zein a Yid. Some believed that from the outset acculturation and assimilation threatened the existence of this people without a country, given the high rates of intermarriage and the secularizing tendencies of American society. In each generation, therefore, there was some urgency in concerns over what remained distinctive about Jewish nationality and Jewish faith, and how Jews might survive what some characterized as a collective identity crisis. These issues shape the five-volume history of the Jews in America published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1992, under the general editorship of Henry Feingold. Written by five thoughtful historians, these books trace the evolution of a Jewish-American identity and measure its vitality against the forces of secularization, materialism, and a culture defined by Gentiles. As the authors assess Jewish-American unity, each implicitly or explicitly posits core values whose erosion is a sign of danger. In some ways they are looking backward, but with their eyes on the future of the Jewish people. However, defining national character, an inherently subjective exercise, is particularly problematic for a people scattered in a large nation, and, as we shall see, reactions to these books depend in no small measure on what one takes to be the essential Jewish values. In A Time for Planting, Eli Faber examines the first migration, from the arrival in New Amsterdam in 1654 of a brave band of Sephardim and Ashkenazim, to the beginnings of the German migration in the 1820s. Once they landed, he argues, Jews mingled rather easily with other colonists in an atmosphere of toleration. To be sure, Peter Stuyvesant tried to expel Jews and to prohibit them from trading to the north, worshipping in public, and using public money to assist the poor among them. But this effort and others were generally unsuccessful. When the English conquered New Amsterdam in 1664, they extended toleration to all inhabitants. After 1740 foreign-born Jews could be naturalized after seven years' residence in the colonies, a privilege not available to Jews in England. Only once, in 1761, did a legislature refuse naturalization (probably out of hostility to Jewish merchants in Newport, Rhode Island).</page><page sequence="3">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 141 The American Revolution, according to Faber, was a watershed for Jewish participation as citizens; although a minority supported the Crown, many Jews spoke out in favor of the rebellion, enlisted in militias, and left their homes for areas under American control. The response must have been gratifying. George Washington denounced bigotry, and, more importantly, most states guaranteed religious freedom in their constitutions. That the Jews were only one of many minority religious groups, and a tiny one at that (the census counted only 2,700 as late as 1820), Faber speculates, may account for this toleration. Although restrictions on the franchise and office-holding stayed on the books in some states, and antisemitism remained a problem, many Jews viewed America circa 1820 as a second Jerusalem. In the communities where they congregated, Jews maintained their culture, Faber argues; indeed, he contrasts Jewish solidarity with that of the Puritans, who failed to stay "knit together." For Jews there was an economic imperative for unity: marriage solidified commercial networks for merchants dependent on their coreligionists for capital and access to markets around the Atlantic. Equally important was the desire to worship together and preserve Jewish tradition. Although Jews dressed fashionably and formed partnerships with non-Jews during the eighteenth century, they worked hard to acquire land for cemeteries, to build synagogues, to certify meat as kosher, and to establish schools for the young. Some Jews submitted themselves to rule by a council. Congregation Shearith Israel of New York, for example, empowered its council to tax members to support the poor and fine them for breaches of discipline. In America, unlike Europe, Ashkenazim and Sephardim often joined the same communal organizations, agreeing to share or rotate positions of leadership. Although tension was by no means absent, unity, Faber concludes, was the norm among Jews in colonial America and in the early national period. It is possible, however, to see in the evidence a pattern that resembles the Puritan experience. Faber acknowledges that the geographical mobility that stemmed from the right of unrestricted settlement tended to pull Jewish communities apart, especially as Atlantic commerce declined and Jews no longer had to live in port cities. Moreover, communal organizations seemed fragile. In 1748, twenty years after its founding, Shearith Israel had trouble getting members to attend meetings, pay assessments, or serve on the governing council. After the Revolution, the Jewish population failed to increase. Some synagogues began to copy their Protestant counterparts.</page><page sequence="4">142 GLENN C. ALTSCHULER Organs, choirs, and Georgian architecture appeared in the more pretentious of them. Hazan Gershom Mendez Seixas delivered "sermons," replete with references to original sin, salvation, and grace. Perhaps most ominously, about 16 percent of Jews married outside the faith. Sanctions for those who did, or for violators of the Sabbath, became lighter and were applied in fewer and fewer cases. At the same time Jewish schools began to close for lack of students. Whatever the strength of communities among earlier generations, the American Jews of the early nineteenth century were increasingly scattered and acculturated. Maintaining a vibrant Jewish presence would have been a daunting task, had there not been a significant infusion of Jews from Germany and Eastern Europe. Between 1820 and 1880 more than 150,000 Jews arrived in the United States, and in A Time for Gathering, Hasia Diner offers a provocative interpretation of this second migration. Rather than a sharp demarcation between a stream of middle-class Germans in the mid-nineteenth century and a flood of impoverished Orthodox Eastern Europeans after 1880, Diner posits a single movement that began in western Europe and moved gradually and unevenly to the east. The earlier immigrants, she insists, were no more affluent than those who arrived at the turn of the century. The German Jews, much like their counterparts in Poland, tended to be pushed to America by the dissolution of traditional peasant life and the economic vulnerability of middlemen and artisans. They were the least "modem" of the Jews of Germany, who had gained little from the legislation of "emancipation" in the years 1820-1871. There was, in sum, a striking similarity between the German immigrants and the Ostjuden they would come to despise. Given the poor quality of the records and the shifting boundaries of central Europe in the nineteenth century, it may be impossible to settle with precision the national origins of these immigrants. Less in doubt is their economic success. Although poorhouse records capture the names of some of those who faltered, the mobility of this group is impressive. Drawing on recent scholarship, Diner locates success, not in a zeal to be educated, but in extended-family networks that offered employment and credit. Peddling helped Jews identify the best sites for small business and facilitated communication among Jews from different areas. It was often a first step for unmarried men on their way to careers in the wholesale or retail clothing industry. Protestant stereotypes made it difficult for Jews to obtain</page><page sequence="5">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 143 loans. An R. G. Dun assessment was typical: "Considered good by all the dealers, but they are Jews, and their ancestors took Jewels of the Egyptians when they left Egypt and never returned them" (quoted on pp. 188-189). By forming partnerships, or pooling capital within the family, however, Jews overcame these obstacles. Like her colleagues in the series, Diner believes that antisemitism in the United States was comparatively tame. If U. S. Grant expelled Jews from the Department of the Tennessee, Lincoln rescinded the order. If Saratoga's Grand Hotel excluded Joseph Seligman, the banker, many Protestants praised Jews for their intelligence, industry, and the chastity of their women. Consequently, Jews participated in public life as Jews. They challenged restrictions on office-holding in Rhode Island (1842), North Carolina (1868), and New Hampshire (1877); fought restrictions on merchandising on Sunday; joined Catholics in opposing the Protestant curriculum of public schools; pressed politicians to protest mistreatment of Jews around the globe. The political and social participation of Jews, Diner insists, did not detract from allegiance to the group. Indeed, a principal argument of this book is that the Jews of the second migration were not assimilationists. The percentage of marriages outside the faith remained small. Benevolent societies mixed ritual with sociability; they had religious schools, Torah readings, and even conducted worship services. Since practicing traditional Judaism in the United States was "if not impossible then certainly difficult" (p. 119), Diner readily acknowledges that religious observance changed. More and more women and men sat together and hazans prayed facing the congregation. Essential elements-the universality of circumcision, the persistence of kashrut, the hiring of a shokhet, the continuation of Sabbath observance-remained largely intact. Diner's evidence, it seems to me, also sustains the view that secularization and acculturation were proceeding apace. The YMHA did stay open on Saturdays, albeit for "light" exercise. Many Jews celebrated Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and no other holidays, and those who observed Purim and Hanukkah often aped Christian practices. Isaac Mayer Wise supported instruction in the Hebrew language, but he urged that Jewish children attend public school. In her determined optimism, Diner at times seems to spar with straw men. Who alleges that the B'nai B'rith and the YMHA rejected "notions about the solidarity of the Jewish people and Jewish responsibilities for one another" (p. 112)? What Reform Jew did not want to be American</page><page sequence="6">144 GLENN C. ALTSCHULER and Jewish? Those who identify assimilationist tendencies among Jews of the second generation emphasize that they are tendencies. Nor will everyone agree about what is tangential to Jewish religion. In A Time for Building, Gerald Sorin suggests, in dissent from Diner, that the 2.5 million Jews who came to the United States from eastern Europe between 1880 and 1920 in the third migration saved American Jewry from assimilation. He celebrates the new immigrants as de facto cultural pluralists, preserving Jewish group life while maximizing involvement in American society and politics. Three-quarters of the third migration came from the Russian Empire, where economic dislocation and the pogroms that followed the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 made life intolerable. Five percent of the population, Jews constituted 50 percent of the emigrant stream. Informed by lantsmen in the United States about jobs and wages, Jews usually came as families, hoping that no one would be detained at the point of disembarkation because of a health problem (as was Goldele in Sholom Aleichem's "Off to the Golden Land"). Cleared through Castle Garden or Ellis Island, which at its peak processed 5,000 newcomers a day, the newcomers met family members and/or representatives of emigrant aid societies. German Jews in the United States, Sorin argues, were ambivalent about the Ostjuden. Fearful that they would drain the resources of American Jewry and rekindle antisemitism, German Jews promoted Americanization and the dispersal of immigrants throughout the country. With 60 percent of the new immigrants located in the corridor from Boston to Baltimore, Jacob Schiff and Oscar Straus tried to make Galveston, Texas, a point of entry for immigrants. German Jews shipped 75,000 Eastern European Jews to the interior of the country, in the hope that many would become farmers. The Educational Alliance taught vocational education, civics ,and American history. After some hesitation, most German Jews did support unrestricted immigration. But more often than not, they kept their social distance, while doling out "cold charity and colder philanthropy" (p. 163). Eastern European Jews made slow but steady economic progress, finding employment in areas that were controlled by German Jews, like the garment industry; moving into small businesses-kosher meat, seltzer water-that served the Jewish community; and in a few instances, with motion pictures as the most spectacular example, taking entrepreneurial risks. Meanwhile,</page><page sequence="7">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 145 voluntary organizations among the immigrants provided communal services, social activities, and sometimes credit. As they worked, Sorin emphasizes, the newcomers also revitalized Jewish culture, breathing new life into Yiddish and yiddishkayt, in fiction, news- papers, and theater. Boris Thomashevsky's Der Yidisher Yenki Dudle and Leon Kobrin's The Next Door Neighbors addressed real concerns, if a bit melodramatically. Ironically, Yiddish was a means of acculturation too, with Abraham Cahan advising mothers in his "bintl brief' to let their kids play baseball. At bottom, Sorin implies, Jews achieved a satisfactory balance. If the Tageblatt had an English page after 1897, it was, after all, a newspaper for Jewish Americans. In the public arena, Sorin argues, Jews tended to join organizations that synthesized Jewish culture with an economic or political program, as the socialist Arbeiter Ring did in enrolling 10,000 members by 1908. When Clara Lemlich of Local 25 moved in Yiddish to strike against the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, she combined a call to the working class with loyalty to Jewish culture. The Jewish emphasis on social justice, moreover, had a profound impact on the American labor movement. Jewish unions (the International Ladies Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers) pioneered in labor-management cooperation and became laboratories for social welfare initiatives, including unemployment and health insurance, credit unions, paid vacations, and educational and recreational facilities. The new immigrants also had a profound impact on Jewish religion. As they arrived, Reform Judaism, which had eliminated circumcision and the ban on cremation, and deemed the Talmud "religious literature," was reaching its peak. By 1910, 90 percent of the synagogues in the United States called themselves Orthodox. The Eastern Europeans, Sorin points out, were not all enamored with Orthodoxy, but were hostile to Reform, and its association with German Jews and assimilation. Sorin detects a drift toward secularization in the early twentieth century. Only 25 percent of Jewish children aged six to sixteen were receiving religious instruction. By 1913 about half of the stores on the Lower East Side were open on Saturday. One senses, though Sorin is by no means explicit about this, that acculturation was diminishing the zeal of those intent on preserving some Jewish practices that the balance had shifted again. Although Eastern Europeans had been uncomfortable with a movement devoid of yiddishkayt, Zionism attracted American Jewish converts in the years after World War I.</page><page sequence="8">146 GLENN C. ALTSCHULER Ultimately, Sorin argues, Zionism may have helped American Jews remain Jewish, but he does not explain why they needed help, or whether Jewish group solidarity and identity began to erode before Congress drastically reduced immigration to the United States in the 1920s. Immigration restriction left second-generation Jews the task of defining a core Jewish identity without transfusions from abroad. In A Time for Searching, Henry Feingold portrays Jewish Americans between 1920 and 1945 as prosperous and anxious, increasingly in the "mainstream," and therefore uncertain about how (or whether) to assert their Jewishness. Far more quickly than other immigrant groups, Jews capitalized on the 40 percent increase in productivity and 11 percent rise in real income in the United States before 1929. Aided by 509 loan societies and 2,367 mutual-benefit societies, they purchased small businesses and entered the middle class. Education paid off as well. About 3 percent of the population, Jews constituted more than 10 percent of the students in professional schools. With economic security, however, came a reluctance to call attention to themselves as Jews, especially when antisemitism surfaced. Prejudice against Jews in the 1920s, Feingold points out, was no abstraction. In 1924 the Ku Klux Klan had 4 million members and Harvard had a quota for Jews. A Variety ad sought ushers with "straight noses," New York Telephone claimed that the arms of Jewish women were too short to operate switchboards, and Henry Ford's Dearborn Independent published the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the charge that Benedict Arnold "served as a Jewish front" (p. 11). With the Depression antisemitism appeared to wane, but Feingold implies that Jews, exaggerating its pervasiveness and power, were in some sense traumatized by it. For this reason many Jews did not advocate intervention against the Nazis in the 1930s; after the fall of France fully 32 percent of Jews preferred staying out of the war to helping Britain. Stephen Wise called the advisors around Franklin Roosevelt "sha sha Jews," because they refused to bring up issues relevant to Judaism. Feingold concludes that individuals had economic and political power in the years between the wars, but Jews exercised little communal power. Pride in the boxer Benny Leonard and the slugger Hank Greenberg was, Feingold suggests, less a sign of the vitality of Jewish identity than evidence of acculturation. As the second generation set the pace, traditional institutions like the matchmaker began to disappear. Actors and audiences deserted the Yiddish theater for the American stage, and the circulation of</page><page sequence="9">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 147 Yiddish newspapers fell by 25 percent. The cadre of brilliant American-Jewish writers-Trilling, Mumford, Hook-took a universalistic perspective, and the next generation-Howe and Kazin-became experts on nineteenth-century American fiction. Produced by the Jewish Warner Brothers in 1927, The Jazz Singer seemed to say, for a generation, that the melting pot worked. Religion too was a weakened reed. Synagogues proliferated, but atten- dance at services declined. Without law, God, or Torah, Reform Judaism seemed to many like a dull, Christless Christianity. The Conservatives, dependent on Reform for funding and the Orthodox for rabbis, appeared to fall between two schools, without a convincing justification for eliminat- ing one ritual and retaining another. Only the Orthodox gained adherents, largely because the immigrants who did come in the 1930s were almost all traditionalists (including Hasidim). Nonetheless, Feingold concludes, efforts to halt the erosion of faith, including the Reconstructionism of Mordecai Kaplan (whose program to replace synagogues with community centers was lampooned as "a shul with a school and a pool" [quoted on p. 116]), were not effective. Only Zionism, he believes, had the power to rejudaize American-Jewish culture. Unfortunately, throughout the 1930s Jews could not muster a united organizational front to advance the cause. Feingold provides a depressing narrative of factional fighting that begins to brighten only with the fund-raising efforts of the UJA in 1938 in response to the refugee crisis. Two decades of uncertainty, then, took their toll on the Jewish-American response to events in Europe. Jews divided on the wisdom of Samuel Untermeyer's proposal to boycott German goods (some feared it might hinder efforts to get Jews out). More importantly, with little support from other ethnic groups and polls showing two-thirds of Americans in favor of a total ban on immigration, Jews did no speak out until it was too late. Feingold's compelling narrative does not always connect the seculariza- tion and acculturation of American Jews to the organizational divisions of the 1930s. The questions debated by Zionists and anti-Zionists, the strategies discussed by those who wanted to resolve the refugee crisis, as Feingold emphasizes, were scarcely clearcut, and it is difficult to see how American Jews, even had they been more secure about their core identity, could have reached agreement on them. As Feingold acknowledges, moreover, unity probably would not have made a significant difference. Like all of us, he wishes that American Jews had done more, but his greater disappointment, it</page><page sequence="10">148 GLENN C. ALTSCHULER seems to me, is that in a time of searching, American Judaism did not find its soul. In a tragic way World War II gave American Jews another chance. The Holocaust, Edward Shapiro asserts, convinced many of "the inescapability of Jewishness" (p. 197). At the end of the war, 40 percent of the Jews in the world lived in the United States. Despite persistent fears of antisemitism that Shapiro, like Feingold, believes were exaggerated, Jews were more willing to display symbols of their religious and ethnic identity in public. It was significant that Bess Myerson resisted suggestions by pageant officials that she change her name to Bess Meredith-and still became Miss America in 1945. American Jews realized how much was at stake: "We who have survived catastrophe," wrote the editors of Commentary, "can survive freedom, too" (quoted on p. 25). A Time for Healing examines the difficulty American Jews have had in the postwar era in settling on the content of Jewishness. During these years, signs of material success and high status were everywhere. Jews were the only ethnic group in the United States without a working class (0.3 percent were laborers). Sixty percent of the Jews in the labor force were professionals. Forbes magazine reported that one hundred of the four hundred richest Americans were Jewish, as were half of the highest-paid Wall Street executives. Near the end of the twentieth century, Jews constitute almost one-quarter of the undergraduates ande faculty in the Ivy League. With the appointment of Irving Shapiro as chief executive officer of DuPont in 1973 and Harold Shapiro as president of Princeton University in 1987, the final glass ceilings in the United States were shattered. And yet-or perhaps and therefore-Edward Shapiro believes that Jewish life has become symbolic and gestural. Yiddish language and culture have all but disappeared, despite the heroic efforts of Isaac Bashevis Singer. In the 1980s the Forward became a weekly; in 1990 it began to publish in English. For most Jews the old ways have become quaint, occasions for a nostalgic laugh or tear in the films Hester Street and Crossing Delancey, and the play Fiddler on the Roof, but not taken seriously as a guide to behavior and belief. The love affair between Jews and education, in Shapiro's view, has accelerated assimilation as well as acculturation. Jewish college professors, far more than their Catholic and Protestant colleagues, have been indifferent about or hostile to religion. As quotas for Jews disappeared from prestigious</page><page sequence="11">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 149 institutions, the Jewish Theological Seminary and Yeshiva University lost students and faculty. Most ominously, Jewish interaction with Gentiles in college increased the rate of inter-marriage from one in fourteen in the 1960s to one in three in the 1980s. Since Jewish attitudes have shifted "from outrage to outreach" (p. 237), with organizations like Mixed Messages producing greeting cards with Santa Claus spinning a dreidel, the trend may well continue. After World War II, Judaism became a valid expression of American faith, and synagogue affiliation increased from 20 percent in 1930 to 60 percent in 1960. But should one equate the "edifice complex" which produced a bar mitzvah factory-cum-synagogue center, a sign of social status in the suburbs, with a substantive commitment to the faith, when 90 percent of Jews did not attend services once a month or more? To Shapiro the identity crisis of Conservative Judaism is telling. Little more than a way-station to Reform or Orthodoxy, Conservatism stretches Jewish law to the breaking point in ordaining women. Given the lack of a coherent religious philosophy in Conservatism, Shapiro is not surprised that youngsters flee "these holding pens with alacrity after the age of thirteen" (p. 173). Only with Orthodox Jews does Shapiro see a glimmer of hope. Now regarded less as anachronisms and more as participants in a vibrant tradition and admired for their commitment, the Orthodox now have many college-educated and financially successful adherents. Although the Orthodox have a relatively high birthrate, Shapiro makes no claim that they can make up for a rate below zero population growth among other Jews. In politics, especially after the 1967 Six-Day War, support for Israel, expressed with words and wallets, has become the common denominator of American-Jewish life. Eighty percent affirm that the destruction of Israel would be "the greatest personal tragedy of their lives" (p. 202). For many the existential Jewish self-definition has become "I am because I give" (p. 206). Neither vicarious pride in the Israeli "Rambowitz" nor preoccupation with Holocaust martyrs, Shapiro suggests, can substitute for more affirmative values. He quotes Rabbi Daniel Jeremy Silver: "a community's sense of sacred purpose must be woven of something more substantial than tears" (quoted on p. 217). Shapiro is certain that Judaism has a future-in Israel-and hopes that "perhaps" Jews will also survive the freedom and prosperity of America.</page><page sequence="12">150 GLENN C. ALTSCHULER But he seems to feel that the game is just about over; American Jews have become Jewish Americans. This view of the tendencies of Jews in America must be taken seriously, given the low rates of birth and high rates of intermarriage. But some might see signs of vitality where Shapiro sees decline. Conversions to Judaism continue, and the Reform decision in 1983, much denounced by the Orthodox, to recognize as Jews the offspring of Jewish fathers and Gentile mothers will add to the pool of those raised in the faith. Moreover, the persistence of political liberalism among Jews suggests that the cultural affinity for government action to promote social welfare and social justice, a trait singled out by Sorin, remains strong. With Milton Himmelfarb, Shapiro seems irked that Jews live like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans. To him neo-conservatism is "sensible." To explain this apparent anomaly might turn Shapiro's assertion that the politics of Jews is one of interest rather than culture on its head. Perhaps a dimly remembered talmudic morality, more than the self-protection of a comfortable middle class, still governs Jews in politics. Fundamentally, though, arguments for atomization and for unity, for declension, continuity, and renewal, depend on one's view of what is transient and of what should be, as well as what has been, permanent in Jewish religious faith and national culture. What are the core beliefs of Judaism? Has that core changed more for Jews than for Protestants and Catholics? Does the secularization of most Israelis throw into question their identity as Jews? Similarly, with Jewish culture, a comparative context might help. Have the values of Jewish Americans eroded more than those of Italian Americans or Greek Americans? Is spectacular economic mobility more corrosive to culture than, say, average mobility? Moreover, is not Jewishness what Jews say it is, even if they disagree profoundly with one another? On the issue of identity, existence may well precede essence. Finally, does not the existence of Israel change the equation for Jews all over the world? For much of their history a people without a country, Jews now have a society, a government, a culture they can call their own. Jews in the United States can try to shape Jewishness by calling Israel to its best self, to its traditions of social justice, toleration, and democracy. In turn, American Jews can renew themselves as Jews by discovering Israel, much as other "hyphenate" Americans "rediscover" their homeland and in the process recreate themselves. That more Jews choose to be buried in Israel than to</page><page sequence="13">"SHVER ZU ZEIN A YID": THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA 151 live there is no cause for lamentation, in my view, but evidence of a deep commitment even among assimilated Jews lacking an active religious faith. Jews in America, as these fine books show, have much to be proud of. Now, the survival of the Jewish people no longer depends on American Jews alone; perhaps the game has just begun.
