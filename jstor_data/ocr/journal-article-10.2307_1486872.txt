<plain_text><page sequence="1">110 BOOK REVIEWS Lawrence M. Wills. The Jewish Novel in the Ancient World. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1995. xi, 279 pp. If I did not fear incurring the reader's wrath, I would begin this review by noting that Lawrence Wills (who teaches Biblical Studies at Episcopal Divinity School) has developed a "novel" approach to an important body of ancient Jewish literature. As it is, I can commence with the commendatory comment that his approach, however we characterize it, succeeds to a large degree in making sense out of the present structure and probable building blocks of the books of Daniel, Tobit, Esther, Judith, and Joseph and Asenath. Wills's rather vague description (a better term than definition) of these works as novels is admittedly somewhat problematic. However, his efforts should be understood not as a comprehensive attempt to capture all of this literary form's salient features, but as an effort both to distinguish it from the historical novel and to define its social function. In the first instance, the novel proper-as opposed to the historical novel-should be understood as a fictitious narrative that "is not about any situation that really existed or any event that really occurred" (p. 2). In antiquity the "novelistic impulse" reflects the move from orally composed to written literature and presupposes the gradually widening presence of an audience that could appreciate the latter. The movement from Daniel to Joseph and Asenath entails, in Wills's typology, increasingly sophisticated literary developments, though never attaining the heights achieved by the somewhat later and higher-class Greek novels. For one of Wills's most engaging exegetical tools is the insight that these Jewish works functioned at the level of popular literature and should be evaluated in much the same way as today's lowbrow, but widely read, products of the same level. Wills postulates, but falls short of proving, the existence of a mass Jewish audience ready and able to devour such material. Wills's general description of the defining features of this literary category encompasses what I would term both theoretical and practical considerations. I found the latter to be more clearly and convincingly presented. Among the specifics are (a) a heightened interest in the emotions and the interior life of leading and even minor characters; (b) a greater focus on women as primary actors and as important figures in and of themselves; (c) a delight in narrative description, whether it entails movement from one place to another or details elements of bureaucratic organization set within exotic backgrounds; (d) an emphasis on Jews and Judaism as functioning within an extended, but still</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 111 close-knit family; (e) an intentionally flippant attitude toward history that both author and initial audience would have appreciatively understood as irony and satire. It is of course this latter point, as much as any other, that has caused concern, if not outright consternation, to commentators. On the one hand, many have sought to rewrite or rather radically reinterpret the extrabiblical record to make room for some hitherto-unknown "historical" characters. On the other, some modem interpreters have determined that their ancient counterparts were at least on occasion confused, mistaken, or sloppy in their "historical" analysis. In Wills's view, neither group has gotten it right. I tend to agree with him, although even he is forced to admit that the irony inherent in these novels (assuming that is what they are) has managed to escape the notice of almost all readers of these texts. It is not possible here to go into the details of his careful book-by-book analysis of the five above-listed works or the more truncated, but no less valuable, survey of four historical novels (Second and Third Maccabees and Josephus' Tobiad Romance and Royal Family of Abiabene), all of which treat in an admittedly novelistic way of historical characters from a time period relatively close to that of their authors. Suffice it to say that I found the chapters on Esther and Tobit to be especially satisfying; for the former I would only add bibliographical reference to an important work that appeared too late for Wills's notice: Karen Jobes, The Alpha-Text ofEsther: Its Character and Relationship to the Masoretic Text (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996). In the case of Daniel, I like what Wills says about the composition of the first six chapters, and his comments on the Greek additions, especially Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, are insightful. But I am still at a loss as to how, when, and exactly why the apocalyptic visions of Daniel 7-12 came to be attached to the other "Daniel" material and the degree to which the final product (in its Hebrew or Greek form) can be designated a novel. As for Judith, I do not object to the thrust of Wills's remarks, and I am even able to follow him when he speaks of the anatomical imagery inherent in the narrow pass leading to Judith's hometown of Bethulia, or "Virgin." But he loses me when he speaks of vaginal connections with Holofernes' tent, which Judith so effectively penetrates. Enough is enough! Overall, I think Wills has got it right, and this carries over to the appendix in which The Testament ofAbraham is characterized as a satirical novel. Even when I find Wills unconvincing, he never fails to be intellectually satisfying and theologically stimulating. It may be too much, but I feel as if I used to read this material like a Tobit, whose vision was obscured by (proverbial)</page><page sequence="3">112 BOOK REVIEWS bird droppings. Now, like Esther or Judith or Asenath, these works have shed their alluring but false finery to reveal the strength that lies at their core. Leonard J.
