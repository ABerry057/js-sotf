Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1994. xii, 336 pp. In this work, David Goodblatt seeks to provide insight into the Jewish political tradition of the Second Temple and talmudic periods. Goodblatt</page><page sequence="2">124 BOOK REVIEWS wishes to ascertain which persons and institutions actually possessed power and tries to identify the ideas used to promote their authority. The author is especially interested in ideologies that supported either the restoration of the House of David or priestly rule. With the "departure of the Davidic dynasty from the public stage," a priestly "monarchy" emerged. At the same time, another tendency existed, the "diarchic constitution." The diarchy, as opposed to the monarchy, had two individuals share power, in this instance the prince and the priest. This theory attempts to balance biblical notions of royalty with the realities of the Second Temple period, when, with few exceptions, the high priests achieved supremacy. The emergence of the nesi'ut during talmudic times represented a "move from priestly to lay rule." This relatively late development, Goodblatt argues, was part of a "general transformation of Jewish civilization from a priestly to a non-priestly character, a move which was decisive in the development of rabbinic Judaism" (p. 4). Despite the role played by the patriarchate in establishing non-priestly rule, Goodblatt argues that talmudic sources tend to downplay the significance of both the patriarch and the exilarch. Goodblatt attempts to show that the notion of a priestly monarchy, which went beyond the notion of priestly superiority by promoting the high priest as the sole ruler, existed between the fourth and first centuries B.C.E. Goodblatt sharply disagrees with the assertion of D. R. Schwartz that Josephus formulated a notion of a high priestly prostasia in order to promote the existence of Judea after 70 C.E. as a religious nation without a state.' Nor was priestly monarchy, as others have claimed, a late attempt to justify Hasmonean rule. Drawing on such diverse sources as the Aramaic Levi materials from the Cairo Genizah and Qumran, Jubilees, and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Goodblatt shows that there is considerable evidence for the promotion of the priests to center stage of Judean political life. So we are not dependent on Hecataeus and Josephus for the prostasia, which Schwartz presumes is a Hellenistic institution with roots in the Diaspora, where the Jews would have been able to relate to a stateless hierocracy. Goodblatt does not regard the complaint of the delegation before Pompey in 63 B.C.E. as a rejection of the Hasmonean combination of kingship and priesthood. Instead he sees an appeal for priestly monarchy. The delegation saw no need for a king because it viewed the high priest as the supreme 1. D. R.

With the exception of the Herodian interlude, "the high priest was the nominal leader of the nation, and the priestly aristocracy the single most dominant force in Judean society" (p. 28). Most interesting is Goodblatt's argument that the Hasmoneans resorted to the title "priests of the most high God."2 The Hasmoneans may very well have shared the notion of a royal priest with others in the ancient Near East, and could easily turn to Genesis 14:18, where the figure of Melchizedek provided a fitting precedent. The alternative notion of shared rule in which the high priest reigns alongside of the prince is best expressed in Zechariah 4. It also appears in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, where it is presented behind the figures of Levi and Judah. Goodblatt even finds evidence for an "eschatological diarchy" at Qumran. All told, the idea of a diarchy was in the air, as it can be traced from Joshua, Ezra and Nehemiah, Ezekiel, the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, and Jubilees. The opponents of Hasmonean rule were not the first to foster the notion; it was already well entrenched in the Persian period (p. 75). To be sure, Goodblatt does admit that the adoption of a diarchic ideology in the time of the Hasmoneans may have been in opposition to their leadership, as contended by A. Hultgaird,3 but he asserts that the idea was not created for this purpose, since it was in existence earlier. So we are left with two tendencies, the priestly monarchy and the diarchy. Both can be seen, says Goodblatt, as attempts to come to grips with the biblical emphasis on the House of David in an era in which the high priests had clearly risen to power. Goodblatt addresses Hultgaird's concern as to why a diarchy would have arisen at a time when the priests indeed ruled. The answer is that a diarchy, as opposed to a priestly monarchy, did not ignore the very real emphasis on royalty in the biblical tradition; the hope for the restoration of the Davidic line could be securely projected into the future. Indeed, according to Goodblatt, the notion of a diarchy persisted into the second century C.E., when coins provide evidence that Eleazar the priest and Bar Kosiba the "Nasi" together led the revolt against Rome. He regards this as a "deliberate diarchy of prince and priest." In reality, however, the notion of a priestly monarchy would be supplanted by the patriarchate, which, by the third century, saw itself as descended from the House of David. In order to show just how innovative 2. See especially Assumption ofMoses 6:1. 3. A.

Although he admits that the sunedrion before which Herod was tried while he was governor of Galilee (Antiquities 14:158-184) could have been a national council, he downplays its importance. Similarly, he regards the boule in Jerusalem that met in the period leading up to the First Revolt (Antiquities 20:11-14; War 2: 331) as little more than a municipal authority. Only the high priesthood constituted a nationally recognized office. This situation persisted after the First Revolt, when Gamaliel II and a "consilium of the patriarch" emerged. This consilium, too, was not a national authority, and the patriarch would truly emerge as a type of monarch in his own right. A similar situation existed in Babylonia, where the exilarchate, also thought to be derived from the House of David, would be established. Goodblatt deserves credit for boldly constructing a theory that explains the move from royal and priestly rule to lay/rabbinic authority. It is here, however, that he repeatedly forces the evidence to fit his overarching construct. Recently, L. Levine has cogently argued that the "exiles" of the Sanhedrin at Bereshit Rabbah 97 and B. Rosh Ha-Shanah 31 a-b cannot be taken as proof of a Sanhedrin in the talmudic period.4 Goodblatt goes even further, arguing that a national authority did not exist prior to 70. This is pivotal to his argument that the high priest and later the nasi functioned as a monarch with no other competing authority. However, the sunedrion before which Herod was tried and the leadership that met during the First Revolt in Jerusalem could in fact have had considerable powers. This is suggested by their jurisdiction, in both instances, over matters in the Galilee, however effective or ineffective. As for the later period, Goodblatt does admit that a patriarchal consilium could have existed alongside the patriarch. Such a consilium, he says, would have derived its authority from the patriarch. Maybe so, but this possibility needs to be explored further. Goodblatt continues this line of thought when he suggests that Genesis Rabbah 97 and B. Rosh Ha-Shanah 31 a-b reflect an anti-patriarchal polemic of the rabbis. Accordingly, the rabbis were promoting their own councils, which existed in the very towns to which the Sanhedrin was exiled. The rabbis probably were doing just that, but not out of opposition to the patriarchate. 4. L. I.

The nasi may at times have been in conflict with the hakhamim, but as L. Levine has recently shown, he also "worked in tandem with them."' P. Sanhedrin 1, 19a, which Goodblatt does not discuss, reveals the conflict between the nasi and the rabbis over the right to make judicial appointments (minnui). The same source, however, reveals just how intertwined the nesi'ut and the rabbis were. Goodblatt believes that the transition from priestly to lay monarchy "accelerated" the emergence of lay Torah authorities, i.e., the rabbis: "The appointment of a leader who himself came from a family of lay Torah experts [i.e., the nasi] must have contributed to the eventual triumph of the principle that priestly affiliation was irrelevant for Torah authority" (p. 230). Goodblatt actually gives the Romans credit for this shift to a lay monarchy, since he believes that they were responsible for elevating Gamaliel II to the position of patriarch in the first place. Gamaliel II, however, must already have achieved considerable recognition as a lay Torah scholar (Goodblatt contests this) and leader before his promotion. To be sure, the appointment of Gamaliel as nasi lent prestige to the rabbis, but how much his appointment affected the acceptance of lay Torah scholars, a process that Goodblatt admits was already underway, is hard to say. While the appointment of Gamaliel may have helped this process reach its culmination, it seems more likely that the reality of the destroyed Temple had more to do with it than anything else. Goodblatt contends that the rabbis downplayed the importance of the patriarchate and the exilarchate. With regard to the exilarchate, he is particu- larly convincing. Palestinian sources, however, allude to the patriarchate and to individual nesi'im much more frequently, and include them in rabbinic circles in a more compelling way. According to Goodblatt, patriarchal claims of royalty and Davidic heritage were "filtered" by the rabbis. While this at times does appear to be true, we can still sense a tension (as opposed to polemic) with the rabbinic realization that the nasi was in fact somebody to be respected because of his position. Goodblatt rightly produces Esther Rabbah 4:4 as evidence that the nasi thought of himself as a king.6 A closer reading, however, reveals that this late midrash is derived from P. Shabbat 12, 5. See L. Levine, "The Status of the Patriarch in the Third and Fourth Centuries: Sources and Methodology," Journal of Jewish Studies 47, no. 1 (1996): 11 f. 6. Goodblatt, on p. 142, wrongly identifies the passage as Ruth Rabbah 4:4.</page><page sequence="6">128 BOOK REVIEWS 13c (= P. Horayot 3, 48c). The Yerushalmi discusses the rivalry that existed between various elements of society, including sages, who wished to appear first in the salutatio before the nasi. The point of the sugia is that even the am ha-aretz who acquires knowledge of Torah deserves precedence over a king or a high priest.7 It is knowledge of Torah that empowers. Goodblatt could have used this passage to further support his argument that the sages rivaled the patriarchate (and priests) for authority. At the same time, this passage and others may reveal nothing more than the evident esteem the rabbis assigned to the office of the nasi. This is a book that scholars will want to consult frequently. Unfortunately, the author has not made this easy to do. There is no bibliography, and the works cross-referenced in the extensive notes are difficult to track down. More importantly, the book desperately needs a final chapter to tie together the many arguments and conclusions proffered. Still, Goodblatt has written a penetrating study of Jewish self-government in antiquity. He is to be commended for his skillful and exhaustive treatment of traditions that shed light on theories of power during the talmudic period and for his always perceptive reading of the sources. A study addressing this subject has been long overdue. Goodblatt's bold foray into this area will assuredly promote further interest and discussion, and will serve as the starting point of any future monograph devoted to the subject. Stuart S.
