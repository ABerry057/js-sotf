<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Neusner. Talmudic Thinking: Language, Logic, Law. Columbia: Uni- versity of South Carolina Press, 1992. xvi, 193 pp. In the present formulation of his monographic studies on the Bavli, Jacob Neusner defines a project of first-order importance. He views the Bavli as a pubic document whose authorship seeks to define and transform the social order, this through offering not only concrete decisions but also a "compelling model of correct modes of thought" (p. 4). He wants to know, he writes, "how do authors bearing so grave a responsibility, so lofty an ambition, as</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 189 the Talmud actually write?" (p. 5). Unfortunately, after setting out such a crucial agenda, Neusner mostly ignores his stated purpose in favor of a series of polemics against others involved in the same scholarship, polemics that will interest few of the audience to whom this book is addressed (apparently undergraduate students in religion). The first chapter, "Language as Taxonomy," offers Neusner's important (though not entirely new) insight concerning the purpose of the choice of language in the Bavli ("What is said in Hebrew is represented as authoritative and formulates a normative thought or rule. What is said in Aramaic is analytical and commonly signals an argument and formulates a process of inquiry and criticism").' But the point requires only a few pages for statement and illustration, and the rest of the chapter is devoted to Neusner's oft-repeated polemic against those who read the Bavli (and the rest of rabbinic literature) intertextually. The next chapter is devoted to showing that the Bavli is not nearly as confusing as has sometimes been represented. To accomplish this, Neusner first presents thirteen pages of undifferentiated text in translation, approximately replicating the Bavli's common printed format, followed by fifteen pages of the same text in Neusner's own translation format, allowing the uninitiated reader to get some sense of the text's genuine contours and clear formal divisions. But Neusner admits that "the intended audience [will] automatically ... have grasped [all of this] from shifts in language and other signals, articulated or implicit, in the flow of language" (p. 56). If the intended audience would have had no problems parsing the talmudic deliberation, then the confusion against which Neusner argues is no confusion at all. This chapter diverts the reader's attention from more important questions that should have been but were not addressed. The most serious flaw in this book is Neusner's failure to account for important details and even general phenomena which characterize the Bavli's rhetoric. For example, in chapter 4 he argues at length that one of the Bavli's most important features is its demonstration of the perfection of the Mishnah. But, as Zechariah Frankel long ago observed, one of the notable differences between the Yerushalmi and the Bavli is the latter document's willingness (and the former's refusal) to claim that the Mishnah is defective. How does Neusner reconcile this with his perfection thesis? Moreover, Neusner so much wants to see singleness of purpose in the Bavli's deliberations that he refuses 1. J. Neusner, The Discourse of the Bavli (Atlanta, 1991), p. 2.</page><page sequence="3">190 BOOK REVIEWS to note the complications, multiplicities, and alternatives in the very texts he presents. For example, beginning at p. 135 he quotes a substantial segment of Avodah Zarah 19b-20b. On this lengthy series of talmudic analyses, Neusner offers us but one brief paragraph (p. 142), claiming that "the upshot is that the entire passage ... answer[s] a single question concerning the Mishnah paragraph," with glosses and amplification. But what of the Bavli's unique willingness to entertain the possibility of hypothetical alternative scriptures whose implicit rejection serves as the source of exegesis (sentences D and F, p. 136)? What about the characteristic defense of alternative opinions in the law without rendering a decision (pp. 137-138)? I and others have commented on these and related phenomena, all crucial to the Talmud's expression. If Neusner disagrees with these analyses, he should explain why. But he maintains a complete silence on such matters. Unfortunately, in place of detailed analysis, Neusner offers merely brief notes. The essential question is, why does Neusner see only "monotony" (his word) where others have seen multiplicity? The answer lies in his chosen method. Neusner's work is built upon his translations of the document in question. These translations read and categorize only superficial characteris- tics, without patient analysis of the nuances of the discourse. This method permits a broad taxonomy of the Bavli's units of discourse, allowing Neusner to describe the larger contours of the document at hand. But, as important as such a description might be, it misses (at least) as much of the fundamental nature of the Bavli as it captures. A method of literary analysis must be measured against the documentary rhetoric it wishes to analyze, and in this case it seems clear that Neusner's approach is contraindicated by the Bavli's peculiar rhetoric. The Bavli does not want to be read quickly, in broad strokes. Instead, the Bavli's authors surely intended their composition to be studied slowly, with painstaking analysis and constant review. The Bavli speaks on the micro-level, in the minute details of its argument and analysis, and not at the level of rough taxonomies. Neusner's method, therefore, is at odds with the essential nature of the Bavli, and his conclusions are inevitably incomplete. Neusner's final chapter, where we should have hoped to find the most compelling statement of his contribution, is the most disappointing. Repeat- edly in this chapter, Neusner argues that "the Bavli's one voice" is evidence that it was all made up at the end-another old polemic. Remarkably, he asserts this singleness, in one way or another, no less than twenty-four times!</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 191 Surely there was something else to say. Furthermore, this chapter is a parade example of the very phenomenon Neusner so disdains-intertexuality-being replete with borrowings from his other writings. On p. 181, he even copies verbatim a paragraph from his book on the Yerushalmi as though the two Talmuds were identical in their most essential characteristics.2 Again, many scholars have argued otherwise; and if Neusner disagrees, he should explain why. In the end, Neusner does not answer the crucial question posed at the beginning, and the reader is left gaining little insight from this frustrating volume. In more recent monographs Neusner has begun to examine some aspects of the Bavli's rhetoric which he here fails to address.3 These volumes represent a significant new direction in Neusner's work on the Bavli, and they surely merit attention. As for the arguments they make, evaluation will have to await later reviews. But whatever the final nuances of Neusner's characterization of the Bavli-and how that characterization relates to the recent work of others--one thing may safely be said: the volume presently under review merely disappoints.
