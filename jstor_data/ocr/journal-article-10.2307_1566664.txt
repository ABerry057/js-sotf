Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, Fourth Series: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. xxviii, 332 pp. In November 1290, King Edward I of England expelled the whole of the Anglo-Jewish community from his kingdom. The only Jews who were allowed to remain in England were the relatively small number who had converted to</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 123 Christianity. Jews were not formally readmitted to England until the middle of the seventeenth century. Historians have long been interested in explaining the reasons for the Expulsion of 1290, but Robin Mundill's book is the first modem monograph devoted to the subject. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter, examining some of the older historiography and looking in general terms at the nature of the surviving evidence relating to the Anglo-Jewish community. Chapter 2 traces the development of the Anglo-Jewish community from its first appearance shortly after the Norman Conquest; it looks at where Jews lived in thirteenth-century England, at the size of the community immediately prior to the Expulsion (no larger than around 2,000), and at the distinctive culture and religious organization of medieval Anglo- Jewry and how this set them apart from the surrounding host community. Chapter 3 examines ecclesiastical attitudes toward Jews, their legal status in England, and the attitudes of the royal family. In chapter 4 Mundill looks at the Jewish contribution to royal revenues during the reign of Edward I in the form of tallages, fines and amercements, reliefs, and occasional windfalls of other kinds. He concludes convincingly that their contribution to the totality of royal revenues was a fairly insignificant one. In chapter 5 Mundill turns to the "Edwardian experiment," the attempt made in the 1275 statute of Jewry to prohibit Jews in England from lending money at interest, an activity which had hitherto been permissible, but only for members of the community. Mundill argues strongly (and quite convincingly) against the existing scholarly consensus that the surviving post-1275 contracts for the delivery of quantities of corn and wool to individual Jews were no more than a disguised form of moneylending, and provides good reason for supposing that there was a real shift in the activities of at least some members of the community into providing advance credit to producers of wool and corn against the future delivery of quantities of those commodities. It is more dubious, however, whether these contracts would not also have been regarded as "usurious" under contemporary canon law, since the form they took seems designed to ensure a profit for the Jew who was providing the producer with credit: thus the Jewish community in England even after 1275 probably did continue to be engaged in "usury." Chapter 6 utilizes the often deficient surviving evidence to delineate the structure and activities of various of the local Jewish communities during the period between 1275 and 1290, and chapter 7 uses much the same evidence to examine the</page><page sequence="3">124 BOOK REVIEWS Christian clients of Jewish financiers during the same period. This establishes that most Christian borrowers were drawn from a relatively small area round the towns of Jewish settlement. The final chapter provides a rather muddled examination of a number of recent attempts to explain the Expulsion and looks at the events of the Expulsion itself in detail and at the apparently rather meager financial returns it provided for the crown. Mundill places responsibility for the Expulsion firmly on the shoulders of Edward I, locating it in the context of his disappointment at the failure to achieve any mass conversion of the community to Christianity and in the stimulus allegedly provided by growing ecclesiastical hostility toward Jews. Mundill's book contains a lot of valuable, original work and (rather less successfully) synthesizes much recent scholarship. This makes it particularly unfortunate that Mundill is so often careless about details. One small example will have to stand for many others. The 1269 "Provisions of the Jewry" were not enacted (as Mundill asserts on p. 41) by Walter of Merton (his only known role in relation to them was delivering them to the Exchequer); nor did they forbid Jews "to take lands on mortgage" (this seems to be a misunderstanding of their main provision, which prohibited the creation of perpetual rent-charges in favor of Jewish creditors). And even a nonspecialist copy-editor might have been expected to notice that a series of papers said in the text to have been published in 1898 is cited in the footnote (quite correctly) as in fact published in 1888 (p. 10). Mundill's book is a revised version of his 1987 dissertation, but work published since 1987 has not been fully assimilated into its overall structure and argument. This book is likely to be used and cited by historians of thirteenth-century England and medieval English and Western European Jewry. The frequency of errors of fact and interpretation suggests that they would be unwise to rely on Mundill without first checking his evidence.
