A Reconsideration of Who Read What in Jewish Eastern Europe* by Alyssa Quint INTRODUCTION In the early 1880s, the staunch Hebraist and bibliophile Ephraim Deinard (1846-1930) became a reluctant witness to the fast-paced growth of modem Yid- dish culture that began in his hometown of Odessa. At the time, Deinard owned a Hebrew bookshop that had been sliding toward bankruptcy until he grudgingly adapted his wares to better reflect the market forces of the Jewish reading culture. In Memories of My People (Zikhronot bat cami), he briefly accounts for (in his view) the ill fortune of being forced to sell the Yiddish books that his customers demanded of him rather than the Hebrew literature he held so dear. Although he mentions a host of nineteenth-century Yiddish writers whom the reader will come to know in the following pages, for our present purpose, it is sufficient to remark upon the catalytic agency he assigns to the Yiddish romance novelist Nakhum Shaykevitsh (aka Shomer) (1849-1905) and Avraham Goldfaden (1840-1908), best known as the father of the Yiddish theatre. Deinard writes: [Alexander] Zederbaum [1816-1893], [Israel] Aksenfeld [1787-1866], and that crazy [Isaac Joel] Linetzky [1839-1915] ... began to spread Yiddish in Southern Russia while in Lithuania only one man, Isaac Meir Dik [1814- 1893], in Vilna, wrote small [Yiddish] booklets for the Romm publishers, who paid him two rubles for every booklet. But no one paid attention to such book- lets .... And [Yankev Sholem] Abramovitsh [aka Mendele Mokher Seforim 1836-1917] did not enlighten the masses, no man dared even to touch his books ... until Goldfaden and Shomer arrived [in Odessa] on their return from Rumania after the Russo-Turkish war [1877-78]. And both of them came to Odessa knowing that in a wave of garbage (spread by the donkey-drivers since Dik) maggots would breed and multiply .... Both of them brought thousands of dollars they collected during the war and had no idea what to do with their money. Goldfaden established a theatre and lost his money but at least saw his dramas realized on the stage. ... And, without knowing the craft, Shomer be- gan to write books full of vanities, many of them in Yiddish ("zhargon"), and discovered a bookshop in Odessa owned by a couple of shoemakers who bought *Many thanks to my colleagues who participated in the fellowship program "Jewish History and Culture in Eastern Europe" (2002-2003) at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania for their comments on an earlier version of this paper. 61</page><page sequence="2">Alyssa Quint everything his pen vomited because they did not read Yiddish and could not un- derstand the garbage that Shomer wrote. It was enough for them that the filth would be sold, paid in full. And buyers gathered in Berdichev where his books were also sold. And seeing that he had a captive audience [Shomer] sat and wrote books all day and his name became well known among the masses. There was not one maiden, one wagon driver from Odessa to Berdichev, from War- saw to Vilna, who did not have Shomer's name on his or her lips.' In his view of the rise of modern Yiddish culture in Russia, colored by his pun- gently expressed resentment of it, Deinard pinpoints Goldfaden's return to Odessa in 1879 as a kind of beginning. But a beginning of what? As Deinard mentions, Yiddish writers like Aksenfeld and Abramovitsh had already begun writing and publishing their work. And Isaac Meir Dik was already making a living as the first professional Yiddish fiction writer since he began producing tradition-cloaked chapbooks in the late 1840s. Modern Yiddish letters had also, by this time, seen its first Yiddish periodical, Kol Mevaser (A Heralding Voice, 1862-1871), which cre- ated a community from Yiddish writers who resided in Odessa and those in more far-flung cities within or beyond the Russian Empire. What was there to begin? Remarkably, the Yiddish novelist Jacob Dinezon (1859-1919), in one of the earliest historical accounts of modern Yiddish literature, "Di yidishe shprakh un ir shrayber" ("The Yiddish Language and its Writer," 1888), corroborates this ver- sion of events and does so with a comparable antipathy to that of Deinard despite his otherwise firm commitment to Yiddish culture. He, too, isolates the late 1870s as a beginning point of a kind: Suddenly around ten years ago, around 1878, there began blossoming Yiddish writers of novels and songs in larger and smaller books and booklets that in- undated the world like a flood [ ... ] Many prolific authors with their novels and stories rained down upon the masses of Yiddish readers with their useless books [ ... ]. But instead of a spring rain that enables the land to bring forth fruit, these novels came like a rain after Sukkot in autumn, only to produce mud and mire from the Jewish streets and pathways. They squander the time of the poor and simple readers and corrupt their appetites, so they will never learn to do good works, and they will never read of useful things.2 Together, Deinard and Dinezon describe the rapid increase in modernYiddish pub- lishing that began at the beginning of the 1880s. They noticed the industry because it now included not only religious ethical literature and prayer books but also, fi- nally, European-modeled Yiddish literature written by Enlightenment intellectu- als. The growth in decidedly modern Yiddish publishing was due to the common reader diversifying his reading to include books of folksongs and romantic and/or 1.

Publishing houses soon began proffering commissions for novels by Shomer-by far the most popular maskilic writer of such works- who in turn inspired imitators. In short, what "began" was an audience-driven lit- erary industry so conspicuous that even those who did not want to take notice, like Deinard, were forced to pay attention. A widely accepted convention ofYiddish literary scholarship is that all mod- em Yiddish literature written from the turn of the nineteenth century until around the late 1880s was written as "a literature for the masses." We are all familiar with observers of nineteenth-century Yiddish literature who have trumpeted the turn from Hebrew to Yiddish by writers of this era as a shift from elitism to an embrace of the folk. Such descriptions are especially conspicuous in the prodigious schol- arship of the Soviet Yiddish critics. Aron Gurshtein, for instance, writes of Sholem Aleichem's career thus: In 1883, Sholem Rabinovitsh (known best as Sholem Aleichem) published his first works in Yiddish. The author understood that to reach the masses he had to engage the living language, not Hebrew, which is accessible only to a very narrow circle of readers. From that moment onward, Sholem Aleichem had found his true calling, and his name grew more and more popular.3 Meir Viner likewise praises Mendele [Abramovitsh's nom de plume] for "his deep closeness (farbundkayt) with the downtrodden, impoverished, and hard-working."4 Not only subscribers to Marxist ideology adhered to such a typology. The great critic Samuel Niger argued that Abramovitsh's early works triggered the awaken- ing of the Jews' collective social consciousness.5 Of course, critics were taking at their word such authors as Abramovitsh, who insisted that his Yiddish career was inspired by his "desire to be useful to his people." "I decided," he writes, "I shall have pity on Yiddish, the outcast daughter of my people."6 Writers of the pre- 1880s era who wrote strictly in Yiddish (and never in Hebrew), like Isaac Joel Linetzky (1839-1915) and Shlomo Ettinger (1803-56), along with the scholars who study their works, write about their Yiddish careers in similar terms. Historian Saul Ginzburg writes that for Israel Aksenfeld (1787-1866), "the primary objective of his literary work was not artistic nor the personal satisfaction the author himself derives from his work, but above all the ethical education and benefits offered to the reader in raising his cultural standards and refining his concepts." 3.

Still, when comparing Abramovitsh with Shomer, Niger argues that both of them enlarged the Yiddish-reading audience while Abramovitsh also contributed to the advancement of Yiddish letters. 6. Quoted in Sol Liptzin, A History of Yiddish Literature (Middle Village, 1985), 42. 7. Ginzburg goes on to write that Aksenfeld's career was "the product of striving to carry out a 63</page><page sequence="4">Alyssa Quint Although acknowledging more nuance and complexity, Dan Miron's A Trav- eler Disguised, the most authoritative scholarly work on this era of modem Yid- dish literature, leaves us with a similar impression.8 Much happier to write in He- brew though they were, maskilim grudgingly prevailed on their own prejudices against the Yiddish language and wrote literature to ameliorate the conditions of the Eastern European Jewish masses-to produce a literature that pointed out the flaws in their lifestyles and prodded them towards more wholesome social and eco- nomic behavior that would entitle them to full rights in the Russian Empire. While a number of scholars have gestured toward some distinction in audience between, for example, Abramovitsh and Shomer, they still tend to think of "Yiddish litera- ture for the masses" as a defining characteristic applicable more or less to all works produced during this first maskilic period of Yiddish culture.9 Moreover, accord- ing to convention, this period ends at the belated date of 1888, when Sholem Ale- ichem inaugurated his canonizing Dos yidishefolksbibliotek, set a respectable lin- eage for Yiddish literature, and encouraged his high-minded colleagues to enjoy its fruits without self-consciousness. Only in 1888 did Yiddish become normal- ized, as authors widened its appeal to attract a variegated audience including read- ers of highbrow tastes.'l But if all nineteenth-century Yiddish literature was consumed by the mass- es, more or less, how do we make sense of the novels and booklets that Dinezon claims had begun "raining down upon the masses" only in the late 1870s and of Deinard's observations about the beginnings of the popular Yiddish activity in Odessa he attributes to Shomer and Goldfaden's arrival around the same time? I propose a hypothesis of the evolution of modern secular Yiddish literature that ac- commodates their observations as it turns on its head the received scholarly ty- pology: instead of two stages, I believe there are, roughly, two discrete beginnings of modern Yiddish literature. The first initiated a tradition of refined, "highbrow" Yiddish literature, which was generated throughout the first three quarters of the nineteenth century. The second, beginning in the early 1880s, marked the rapid growth of the "lowbrow" modern Yiddish book industry described earlier."

Dan Miron, A Traveler Disguised: A study in the rise of modern Yiddish fiction in the nine- teenth century (New York: Schocken, 1970). Miron does not occupy himself with the questions with which I am concerned in this paper. Aside from his study of Abramovitsh, he focuses on the develop- ment of a Yiddish literary establishment. Nonetheless, he does assume that the masses were reading far more than I believe they were reading. This is clear, for instance, on p. 161, when he calls Kol mevas- er a "popular success." In a supporting footnote to this he quotes newspaperman Alexander Zederbaum on page 295 n. 54. See my analysis of the same passage, following. 9.

Generally, I apply the term "highbrow" to works of lasting value that appealed to a relatively small audience and "lowbrow" to popular literature of the moment that appealed to a large group. Fol- lowing, I shall suggest that Goldfaden's works complicated this schema in the same way producers of Shakespeare did in nineteenth-century America. See Lawrence Levine's classic study Highbrow/Low- brow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988). 64</page><page sequence="5">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? two streams of literature developed independently and the implication of this mu- tual independence is that each cultivated, by and large, its own readership, ac- cording to its own prescriptions, aesthetic and otherwise.12 Publishing records would go far in determining who read what; but in the absence of such a histori- cal record-at least until the belated year of 1888-anecdotes, memoirs, and the works themselves serve to reconstruct an impression of who in fact bought these works and who was able to navigate their pages. I posit the existence of roughly two audiences: one that consumed highbrow Yiddish literature and a second that bought literature that offered purely popular appeal. In assuming that all modern nineteenth-century Yiddish literature was "popular," a crucial fact has slipped from our attention: that as late as the 1860s and 1870s, most of the four million potential Yiddish readers distributed through- out the Russian Empire continued to thirst for decidedly "traditional" literature, including religious and ethical literature, homiletic commentary on the Bible called Tsenerena (Come Out and See, 1622), and mayse-bikhlekh (literally, story books or chapbooks).13 In the 1850s they had also begun to read a modern version of the mayse-bikhl by writers like Dik, who injected lessons into his writing in- tended to prod his reader to adopt the habits of bourgeois life but also included tra- ditional ethical teachings and otherwise abided by his readers' notion of accept- able literature. Dik was an adherent of the Haskalah, which much of Russian Jewry considered heretical. Nonetheless, he reached hundreds of thousands of readers with his piously titled, anonymously published chapbooks because these readers believed his stories to be continuous with the post-biblical ethical literature they trusted.14 Shomer inherited Dik's mantle of popularity with romance novels im- bued with an even more modern and secular tenor. Meanwhile, most Jews were oblivious of much of the Haskalah literature we have come to identify with this pe- riod-works written by Abramovitsh, Aksenfeld, and Linetzky, along with the plethora of writers who published regularly in what is celebrated as the first mod- em Yiddish newspaper, Kol mevaser. Who read such literature? Often overlooked in the history of Yiddish litera- ture is a second and far tinier community of Yiddish readers that had begun crys- 12. Of course, such a schema is abstract. Historically, there was much more fluidity between the "two readerships" and we might even imagine several representative readers who distinguished themselves from one another by such factors as their reading ability, their level of cultural sophistica- tion, and their exposure to different sorts of books. 13.

There were other indica- tions readers knew they could trust Dik's chapbooks. They were a product of the Romm publishing house that published almost all of the religious literature and, as Roskies explains, the appearance of the book from the typeface to the "old-fashioned coverings" were clues to the reader that it was what it seemed (Roskies, Bridge of Longing, 67-68).

Also flooding their ranks, I suggest, were Jews benefiting from a so- cioeconomic Haskalah.'6 Their socialization to a bourgeois lifestyle opened their eyes to more modern and refined cultural tastes not matched by their knowledge of another language beside Yiddish. I argue that this group alone read the Euro- peanized Yiddish literature that veered away from the strict formula of the pot- boilers; the Yiddish poetry, novels, and dramas that we most closely identify with this period. Often, they read these works in manuscript copies that authors circu- lated among friends and colleagues and, I believe, were the chief consumers of most published maskilic Yiddish literature as well."7 We are forced to consider the importance of this relatively tiny audience when outlining the evolution of Hebrew literature. And yet we have paid it scant attention in discussing the origins of an analogous, "highbrowYiddish literature"-probably because we have, thus far, not come to terms fully with such a category's existence.'8 In the following pages, I shall examine this highbrow Yiddish literature, its authors' inclination toward the drama, the nature of this literature's popularity, and, finally, the business of Yid- dish publishing. Playwright and popular theatre man Avraham Goldfaden (1840-1908) al- lows us a unique vantage point from which to open a more general discussion on the nuances of the Yiddish audience. Unlike his drama-writing contemporaries and predecessors, he alone would eventually parlay his skill as a maskilic playwright into founding a theatre that served a popular audience. In considering the com- mercial side of Yiddish culture, we shall revisit Kol mevaser, and modem Yiddish literature's first classic anthology, Dos yidishefolksbibliotek (1888-89), and ex- 15. Dan Miron recognizes this group of readers in A Traveler Disguised but never speculates as to what percentage of the overall readership they comprised. 16. In Steve Zipperstein's densely informative article, "Haskalah, Cultural Change, and Nine- teenth-Century Russian Jewry: A Reassessment," Journal ofJewish Studies 34, no. 2 (1983), 191-207, the author points to the plethora of factors besides the ideological one (which is the focus of so much scholarship) that contributed to the pace of modernization and acculturation of Eastern European Jew- ry. He calls attention to the relatively accelerated pace such processes underwent in the cities and cites statistics on Jewish literacy (including of Yiddish) that would be directly relevant to a more in-depth study of what most nineteenth-century Eastern European Jews were able to read. 17. This paper benefits from and hopes to contribute to a revised and more complicated un- derstanding of the Haskalah as a movement in all its dimensions that corrects the mostly ideological reading of it we have been left with until recently. For an excellent sample of such scholarship see Mordechai Zalkin's recent study of the Eastern European Haskalah with a particular focus on its re- gional, economic, and social gradations, Be-alot ha-shakhar: ha-haskalah ha-yahadut be-imperye ha- rusit be-meya ha-tsha esre (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2000).

Dos yidishefolksbibliotek offers us the earliest surviving publishing records of Yiddish literature, which support the con- clusions I draw in these pages. The suggestion that underlies this discussion is that many maskilim who wrote Yiddish literature did so-albeit with varying degrees of consciousness-for themselves and for their educated contemporaries whom they knew to be avid readers of their work. They wrote for their fellow maskilim, all the while insisting on a Yiddish literature "for the masses." I. THE CASE OF GOLDFADEN AND THE PREPONDERANCE OF MASKILIC YIDDISH DRAMA Before establishing the Yiddish theatre in Rumania in 1876, Goldfaden had published three items: a collection of Hebrew poetry entitled Blossoms and Flow- ers (Tsitsim uferakim 1865); the anthology of Yiddish songs The Little Jew (Dos yidele, 1866); and The Jewess (Di yidene, 1869), a Yiddish-language miscellany containing poetry and dramatic writings. The latter included a four-act Enlighten- ment closet drama entitled Aunt Sosya (Di mume sosye) and a libretto for a second drama entitled The Grandmother and the Granddaughter or Bontshe the Layer of Wicks (Di bobe mitn eynikl oder bontshe di kneytlekhlegerin). Together, these works seem to chart Goldfaden's movement, first toward Yiddish in general and then toward producing Yiddish theatre. Indeed, previous scholars have considered Aunt Sosya in their quest for the theatre's beginnings. But there is no evidence that his career as playwright flowered organically into his career as a theatre producer. To the contrary: Goldfaden stumbled upon the opportunity to produce Yiddish the- atre accidentally, in 1876, on what was intended as a brief visit to a colleague in Rumania. Scholars have not adequately made sense of why Goldfaden was moved to write Yiddish drama years before he had even contemplated producing mass Yid- dish theatre. Nor have they reckoned with the discrepancy of quality that is so ob- vious when comparing his pre-theatre dramas with the staged productions of his popular melodramas for which he came to be known. Goldfaden's early cultivation of his writing in both Hebrew and Yiddish was part of a larger trend of nineteenth-century Jewish bilingualism.19 As the official Jewish national language of the Eastern European Haskalah, Hebrew commanded the artistic devotion of its followers, notwithstanding the small numbers of Jews who read it. A picture emerges of what the maskilim intended would come of the two literatures: a culturally uncompromised Hebrew literature would serve their elite audience while the Yiddish that flowed from their pens would be read by the masses of otherwise unlettered Russian Jews. In other words, Enlightenment lead- ers tried to cultivate a Hebrew literary revival without a mass reading base while producing the Yiddish-language literary culture strictly for the masses-and ex- pecting it to vanish after its readers learned enough German, Russian, or Hebrew. 19. In A Traveler Disguised, Miron argues that the nature of the bilingualism was such that those who wrote in Yiddish persisted in writing or translating their work into Hebrew (or had begun their ca- reers writing Hebrew first) because they felt Yiddish was "not altogether a natural literary medium." Miron, A Traveler, 10-11. 67</page><page sequence="8">Alyssa Quint If this is indeed how the literatures proceeded to develop, samples of early mod- ern Yiddish works should provide a unique opportunity to investigate the quality of a literature that had no elevated literary aspirations. In contrast to most other budding modem literatures, which were driven by a range of writers who openly addressed a diverse audience that, in turn, sustained a literature of wide-ranging sensibility and sophistication, Yiddish was, according to convention, cultivated only for a simple audience that was unschooled in any modern European literary trend. Two decades before Yiddish literature was supposedly normalized in the 1880s, so this reasoning goes, the only impulse to write Yiddish that existed among maskilim was to address a mass audience. For this reason, a folksy and tradition- laced work like Goldfaden's The Little Jew exemplifies the burgeoning Yiddish lit- erature as its chroniclers have imagined it. By those terms, Goldfaden's high-minded anthology The Jewess, especially the drama Aunt Sosya, presents quite a conundrum.20 The literary historian Leo Wiener insists that Aunt Sosya is the single best comedy of Goldfaden's prodigious comic oeuvre, in which the author flaunts his technical mastery of the genre and draws characters of refined psychological dimension.21 The question of the work's aesthetic worth, however, is only secondary to the question of its author's literary aspiration. Aunt Sosya-with its complexity of plot and battalion of subtly drawn characters-is of a piece with earlier modern Yiddish dramas that are equally and puzzlingly highbrow. The relative sophistication of these works is especially pal- pable when compared to the quaint and crudely drawn stories of Dik or, for that matter, the Yiddish folk songs Goldfaden had published three years earlier.22 Not only, then, did certain Yiddish works, like Goldfaden's Aunt Sosya, con- tain a technical sophistication belying its reputation. But Yiddish maskilic works did not uniformly indulge an attitude of "destructive exposure" toward the Yiddish language, nor did it consistently target Hasidism, the archetypal enemy of the Haskalah and the supposed raison d'etre of the literature.23 On the contrary, the Yiddish language was sometimes explicitly championed. In Aksenfeld's drama Man un vayb, shvester un bruder, for instance, an orphaned Jewish girl escapes 20. For a close reading of Aunt Sosya and its importance see "The Botched Kiss: Love and Death on the Yiddish Stage" in Jews and the Creation of Modern Culture in Eastern Europe (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, forthcoming). 21.

For a selection of Dik's works see Samuel Niger's edition of his work Ayzik meir dik: gek- libene verk (New York: CYCO-Bicher Farlag, 1954). Niger's introduction offers useful historical facts about Dik's success as a popular Yiddish writer. Bear in mind, however, Niger did take liberties as an editor and smoothed out some of the crude areas of Dik's texts. Also see Dan Miron's discussion of the chapbook genre and their implied readers in "Folklore and Antifolklore in the Yiddish Fiction of the Haskala," in The Image of the Shtetl and Other Studies of Modern Jewish Literary Imagination (New York: Syracuse University Press, 2000), 49-80. 23. This is Miron's usage in A Traveler Disguised. He quotes Dik who explained his Yiddish writing thus: "An old building is not to be wrecked with the prick of a needle, but with the pounding of sledgehammers." Quoted in Miron, A Traveler, 56. There was, in general, much more ambivalence about the Yiddish language even among the most stalwart maskilim like Dik.

She does so by remembering the few Yiddish words she learned as an infant. The Yiddish language proves a protective linguistic buffer, a system of shib- boleths in an unforgiving and anti-Semitic world. With the non-Jewish family with whom she grew up, the orphan learned Polish, German, and French-languages that the Haskalah held out as keys to Jewish self-betterment-but only Yiddish saves her life.24 Ettinger's Serkele promotes as its hero a money-grubbing Jewish tavern-keep- er whose Yiddish speech is only made worse by his sibilating Lithuanian accent. But as an explicit response to The Merchant of Venice, the tavern keeper is actually a vin- dication of Shakespeare's Shylock-a vindication of his financial conservatism, his legalism, and his right to be respected in all his religious and ethnic difference. He emerges as the financial bedrock of the drama's new society and is rewarded with a bride and a casket of gold as her dowry.25 In both plays, Yiddish is the strongbox of Jewish cultural difference in a world vulnerable to the demands of cultural assimila- tion. Since such plays thematize issues ofYiddish language and make no mention of Hasidism, they are only the most obvious challenge to the notion that this literature functioned purely to extinguish the Yiddish language and aspects of traditional Jew- ish life masklim thought impeded progress.26 But there are many more works that abide by the aesthetic principles of Enlightenment literature without conforming to the political and social prescriptions of the Haskalah.27 The existence of such dramas, I believe, suggests that writing a literature "strictly for the masses" is a far thornier problem than most maskilim and schol- 24. Aksenfeld, Man un vayb shvester un bruder: an emese mayse bearbet in teatershtik in 2 ak- ten (Odessa: 1867). In a letter to a Russian official, Aksenfeld claimed to be a maskil invested in the literary crusade against Hasidism but only some of his works even make mention of Hasidism. I sus- pect he believed that bashing Hasidism would further the chance that the official would force the arm of a Jewish publisher to publish his work.

For an analysis of Man un vayb see Alyssa Quint, "The Botched Kiss: Avraham Goldfaden and the Literary Origins of the Yiddish Theatre" (PhD diss., Harvard University, 2001). My impression is that Aksenfeld believed his works to be accessible to the common reader, however misguided such a view was, and believed that the drama (not just per- formance) was particularly effective in engaging the masses. This view was pervasive in the maskilic community. See ch. 14 of his novella "Dos shtern-tikhl," in Dos shtern-tikhl, der erstheryidisher rekrut, ed.

The maskilic "dilemma" might have been best summed up by journalist and writer Joseph Judah Lerner (1849-1907), who adopted Nikolai Chernyshevsky's words in writing to his fellow maskilim in the in- troduction to his Yiddish translation of UrielAcosta: "Work and multiply, for there- in lies our strength; if you didn't exist I would not be able to write, but if all Jews were like you, I would not have to write."28 The latter part of Lerner's statement dovetails nicely with what has already become commonplace when considering the Yiddish literature of this era: if all Jews were like Lerner's maskilic friends, ed- ucated in languages other than Yiddish, he would not bother to write Yiddish. And yet the first part of his statement comments on an element of the sociology of mask- ilic writing that we have not probed deeply enough: Yiddish writers needed each other-they thrived with the support, attention, and camaraderie of fellow writers and only under such circumstances of mutual support were they able to pursue their literary careers with seriousness and commitment. Whether or not they were actu- ally published, the Yiddish plays penned by Goldfaden's forerunners achieved a well-documented currency within the maskilic circles that dotted the Russian Em- pire.29 Doubtless it was this currency, along with an attendant sense of a burgeon- ing literary tradition that reflected and drove the strong appeal of Yiddish drama writing among Goldfaden and his friends.30 Such artistic circumstances conduced and encouraged a literature that quickly became something different from the "lit- erature for the masses" that at least some maskilim had intended. 28. Joseph Lerner, Uriel akosta: a tragedye infinfakten (St. Petersburg: 1888). Lerner lifts this quotation from Nikolai Chernyshevsky's preface to Shto delat? (What is To Be Done?), in which he ad- dresses his common readers with "arrogance" but singles out a "particular group of people" that he "re- spects" and without whom he could not write. 29. Of course, that they were not published ensured that they could never attract a broad audi- ence. But there is no evidence that those Yiddish authors who were fortunate enough to see their works published ever attracted a wide audience. 30. Historical record shows that the firstYiddish Enlightenment drama, Di genarte velt, inspired Ettinger to write his Yiddish works and also fell into the hands of Aksenfeld. Similarly, Ettinger's play achieved well-documented familiarity among the tightly knit cells of maskilim as friends and colleagues circulated handwritten copies of Serkele. Efraim Fiszelson, dedicated his satire, Teater fun khsidim, (Hasidic Theatre, 1839) to Ettinger (this was also circulated in manuscript). Evidence of Ettinger's lit- erary presence extends to his fast friend, Avraham Gottlober, who wrote his Yiddish comic opera The Bridal Veil or Two Canopies in One Night a year after "Dr. Ettinger" presented him with his literary ex- periment. Similarly, Galician maskilim Yeshayahu Gutman and Hirsh Raytman penned bourgeois dra- mas that were found in manuscript bound together in a single volume with Ettinger's Serkele. Serkele's most celebrated emulator was Goldfaden with his play Aunt Sosya. Maskilim, similarly, read and cir- culated Aksenfeld's works, earning the mostly unpublished Yiddish writer a brand of quiet celebrity. "The most educated of men read his work with great delight," Zederbaum wrote in his obituary of the author in Kol mevaser. Moses Lilienblum, another maskilic personality who would flirt briefly with the Yiddish theatre, was also reportedly stirred by Aksenfeld's literature. As early as the 1860s, signs ap- peared of "a sense of literary accumulation," something Miron dates to the late 1880s. We may notice palpable signs of this in the explicit homage by lesser-known playwright Yoel Berish Falkovitsh (18??- 1868) to Aksenfeld in his play Rokhele di zingerin (1888). Attentiveness to Aksenfeld is obvious, too, in the writing of playwright Judah-Joseph Lerner, who published an analysis of Aksenfeld's work in Russian, Kriticheskii razbor: na evreisko-nemetskom zhargon (Odessa: 1868) that claims the distinc- tion as the first piece of literary criticism on a work of Yiddish literature. 70</page><page sequence="11">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? When the maskilim penned these European Yiddish dramas, with or without their full awareness, they turned away from the audience they had officially hoped to address according to their own ideological prescriptions (the mass reader) and addressed each other instead. Or, in the words of reader-response theoreticians, the "implied reader" of these dramas reveals the attributes of an "ideal reader," pos- sessing of the tastes and skills of the author himself rather than those of the semi- literate Yiddish rube. More concretely put, the "implied reader" is capable of read- ing the author's work; able to fill in its gaps or "indeterminacies" with his own learned expectations of the genre.31 For the demands of the Yiddish playwrights' texts imply a reader sufficiently acquainted with European literary convention to navigate it. As Jonathan Culler explains, [A] work has structure and meaning because it is read in a particular way .... To read a text as literature is not to make one's mind a tabula rasa and ap- proach it without preconceptions; one must bring to it an implicit under- standing of the operations of literary discourse which tells one what to look for."32 This is not simply a theoretical argument: it is impossible to imagine a mass Yid- dish-speaking audience capable of navigating dramatic texts before Goldfaden's theatre popularized modern European dramatic conventions in the early 1880s. Abramovitsh, probably still too optimistic with his drama The Tax (Di takes, 1869), was alert to the problem. He made an effort not only to make his work more palat- able or "kosher" by introducing it to his audience by way of an avuncular and tra- ditional book-peddler benignly named Mendele. He also has Mendele slyly explain to his targeted common reader the institution and practicality of the dramatis per- sonae that uniformly appear before the first scene of a modern play. "I have made for you a separate piece of paper (a tsetl) of all the characters that appear in the story so you may keep all of them before your eyes, and you may always remem- ber them."33 Even with such efforts, the playwrights' works were far too literary 31. Reader-response theory is, in general terms, a critical approach that assumes that the exis- tence of the reader is a decisive component of any meaningful literary analysis and that consideration of how the reader "completes" the text must be examined when accounting for the meaning of a liter- ary work. See Reader-Response Criticism: From Formalism to Post-Structuralism, ed. Jane P. Tomp- kins (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980). 32. Culler continues, "One can think of these conventions not simply as the implicit knowledge of authors .... The activity is made possible by the existence of the genre, which the author can write against, certainly ... but which is none the less the context within which his activity takes place." From Culler, "Literary Competence" in Tompkins, Reader-Response Criticism, 102. Consider, even, the way in which the words are organized on the page of a dramatic work: with the speakers' names on the far- right margin and their lines next to them. How would a typical Yiddish reader understand how to read a text organized in such a way based on their diet of chapbooks and prayer books? 33. Abramovitsh, "Di takse" in Ale shriftn fun mendele moykher sforim (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, n.d.), 5. Dinezon claims that "the masses" read The Tax, but my sense is that he confuses here a writer's evident effort to relate to a common reader (and thereby to eschew the con- descension that Dinezon detected in early maskilic literature) with the actual existence of a common readership. 71</page><page sequence="12">Alyssa Quint for most Yiddish readers of the time to understand.34 How could a provincial, pi- ous woman who is used to reading her tsenerena understand even the very orga- nization of the words and names on the pages of a modem drama? Without ac- quaintance with the conventions of a drama most Yiddish readers were simply bereft of the literary proficiency needed to "complete the text." II. BOURGEOIS READERS VERSUS COMMON READERS Until now, certain equations have organized our understanding of the mask- ilic Yiddish literature that was generated before Sholem Aleichem's public rela- tions campaign in 1888. A work penned in Yiddish during this period means ipso facto that (1) it was primarily a tool of Enlightenment propaganda; (2) it was fi- nancially lucrative owing to its potential market;35 (3) it was intended for the mass- es; and (4) if it was published, it was read by the masses. But I propose that the re- lationship among such dimensions of a given work is far more complex and deceptively unstable. Khone Shmeruk draws our attention to the possibility of flaws in this neat bit of empirical reasoning in his discussion of Enlightenment lit- erature, "Between Hasidism and Haskalah."36 Shmeruk argues, generally, that maskilim had to set aside their aversion to the Yiddish language to write anti- hasidic Yiddish literature that warned of the religious sect's deleterious effects. And yet, he also concedes that such a propagandistic function cannot account for the anti-hasidic literature we know to have been written in Hebrew-most notably Joseph Perl's Megale tmirim (Revealer of Secrets), a work that demonstrates the enjoyment maskilim took in imagining the demise of their ideological enemies.37 That is-and this is rather typical of "bourgeois culture" in general-maskilim as readers gravitated to literature that preached their own values and animated dilem- mas or intrigues that were particular to their class. According to the prevailing wis- dom, maskilic writers reasoned that the common Jew's need to learn the lessons of the Haskalah would correspond with their eagerness to read Yiddish maskilic lit- erature. Hadn't they themselves hungered for Enlightenment when they were mere 34. See Miron's A Traveler Disguised for a full discussion of Abramovitsh's Mendele and his prefaces. The occurrences of an artist "aiming too high" in trying to write for a popular audience are myriad. A good example is that of Bertolt Brecht, who believed that popular art had to "represent and validate" the progressive section of the people and tried to create a popular culture to respond to this need. But he "misunderstood the culture of the people" and his plays only appealed to, by and large, an educated and bourgeois audience. See John Fiske's article "Popular Culture" in Critical Terms for Literary Study, ed. Frank Lentricchia and Thomas Mc Laughlin (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995), 326. 35. We shall consider Yiddish literature's lucrativeness below in our discussion of Kol mevaser and Dos folksbibliotek. 36. Khone Shmeruk, Sifrut yidish: perakim le-toldoteha (Tel-Aviv: The Porter Institute for Po- etics and Semiotics, 1978), 198-261. Shmeruk reminds his reader that most of the anti-hasidic litera- ture written before the 1860s was not published and was therefore not available to "the masses" that most of the authors intended to reach with it. But he does not make this argument about published works as I am, here, arguing (see p. 241). 37. Shmeruk, Sifrut yidish, 253. He also writes on p. 259, "There is no room to doubt the pri- mary motives that the maskilim brought to Yiddish in their battle for the soul of the nation, but one may find clear signs that the masses were not the single addressees of this literature." 72</page><page sequence="13">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? Yiddish-speaking shtetl-dwellers? But, in fact, there is no proof that Yiddish liter- ature was an exception to the general rule that the champions of bourgeois values were themselves the greatest consumers of bourgeois literature. For those readers already familiar with its lessons, the literature's didactic streak was more than off- set by the amusement and self-affirmation it offered. If maskilim immersed themselves in the pleasures of a Hebrew didactic cul- ture that reinforced lessons in which they were already schooled, why should we doubt that they came to appreciate Yiddish literature penned by the same authors that preached the same values? True, Hebrew could satiate the soul of an ardent maskil. But what if he sought lighter entertainment that may be enjoyed by his wife, daughters, or less learned neighbor? References to literary salons in which the mid- dle class attended readings and recitals in Yiddish give dimension to the picture of maskilic enjoyment of Yiddish.38 In a study regarding the amelioration of the con- ditions of Russian Jewry penned in 1868, Russian-Jewish journalist Joachim Tarnopol suggests the ubiquity of such gatherings. Surprising to students of Rus- sian-Jewish intellectual history is Tarnopol's mention of Yiddish-not Hebrew- as the favored language of entertainment. That is, in fact, the only consumers of early modern Yiddish dramatic writing we know of (when we know of them) were the maskilim themselves. Tarnopol writes: In many towns of our fatherland, for instance, Warsaw, Vilna, Odessa, Mo- ghilev, Berdichev, and the like, there are whole groups of cultured Jews and there exists in these enlightened circles a special kind of literary entertain- ment: people pass the time in reading aloud, in the common Polish-Yiddish jargon, stories, dramatic scenes, whole pamphlets in verse or prose. In these booklets, which are declaimed before the entire assemblage, many foolish cus- toms, obsolete superstitions, and false Hasidic ideas are ridiculed in an ex- tremely sharp fashion.39 [emphasis mine] Reports of such gatherings of maskilim or bourgeois Russian Jews surface in the memoirs of men like Yiddish novelist Dinezon and the Hebrew critic Avraham Paperna.40 38. Although the salon culture among Jewish Enlightenment proponents has not been system- atically documented, its existence should be of no surprise. A lively salon culture in the private homes of Russian aristocrats and intelligenty represented a vital cultural meeting point in Russian society and was the first venue for scores of works which government censors prohibited for publication or from the public stage, most famously Pushkin's Boris Godunov and Griboedov's Woe from Wit. For a dis- cussion of the literary salon in Imperial Russia see William Mills Todd III's fascinating study, Fiction and Society in the Age of Pushkin: Ideology, Institutions and Narrative (Cambridge: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1986). See Dinezon's casual description of a reading of Abramovitsh's (Yiddish novel) The Nag he attended at a bourgeois home while living in Moscow in 1877. See Dinezon, Zikhroynes un bilder (Vilna: 1877), 186-190. 39.

I am arguing that popular audiences were largely oblivious or re- sistant to maskilic literature; but even when maskilim managed to infiltrate a mass audience, it is doubtful that the audience saw in such didactic literature that which its authors intended for it to imbibe. As the popular culture theorist John Fiske ex- plains, "In popular culture the text is a cultural resource to be plundered or used in ways that are determined by the social interests of the reader, not by the structure of the text itself, nor by the intentions (however we may discern them) of its au- thor ..."41 In other words, common readers, who were pious Jews, read Dik de- spite, not for, his carefully placed moral tangents. They had more authoritative sources of moral instruction. Dik came to learn this bitter lesson later on in his career: I am sure that a great number of my readers do not suspect my good intentions, and read my stories ... for pastime only, and will accuse me, the writer of the same, as being a mere babbler who distracts their attention from serious stud- ies, and of writing for the money that is in them. I know that full well, and yet I keep on doing my duty, for even greater men than I have been treated in no better way by our nation ... .42 Dik might have been the exception in the degree of awareness he brought to the problem of audience. But I doubt there were not others who considered the audi- ence question just as thoughtfully. Unlike the popular writings of Dik, Yiddish dramas, along with most mask- ilic Yiddish literature, I speculate, were not reaching the "audience of the masses" we associate with pre-1880s Yiddish literature. In contrast to the record of bour- geois enjoyment of highbrow modern Yiddish literature, there is no such record on the part of a common or once-common reader. This may be chalked up to the dearth of such testimonials. But there is evidence to support the very opposite possibili- ty in the memoirs of Menashe Halpern (1871-1960), who had little education as a boy in Russia, and who published an account of his early years late in life. After coming to appreciate the breadth of Yiddish literary talent, Halpern writes: Look in The Lexicon of Yiddish Literature and you will find a number of writ- ers belonging to Shomer's generation, and a number who preceded him, some greater and some lesser. But that does not change the picture etched in my memory. [Shomer's Yiddish-writing contemporaries] became very illustrious; they also wrote Yiddish. But the masses were not able to read them-and in the case of those who did read them, the number of readers was a tiny one. drama un der ershter yidisher forshtelung: mayne zikhroynes vegn avrom goldfadn," Pinkes: aferlty- oriker zhurnal far yidishe literar geshikhte 1 (1927): 185-189.

[ ... ] Putting aside the charges fairly or unfairly leveled against Shomer, he has retained the distinction of having taught the masses how to read and for having made from them a large reading circle. He was the first to alter the face of his generation ....43 Halpern shows that, except for Shomer, the reading life of his shtetl remained im- pervious to most Yiddish Enlightenment literature that has, nonetheless, come to represent this era of Yiddish culture. III. THE BUSINESS OF YIDDISH LITERATURE If, as our theory goes, most Yiddish literature attracted only a small pool of readers, then why was it so lucrative? In fact, it was not. In 1862, the year the gov- ernment lifted the publishing monopoly it had imposed in 1835, the complexion of Yiddish publishing changed surprisingly little.44 If one were to espouse the no- tion that censorship impeded the beginnings of Yiddish literature, 1862 should have been a watershed year; the unpublished Yiddish works that enjoyed the ad- miration of only a tiny audience-works by Avraham Gottlober, Ettinger, and Ak- senfeld, alone-warranted immediate publication. Why then, when the floodgates were lifted, was there no flood?45 Perhaps the press in Odessa was too poor to make 43. Menashe Halpern, Parmetn (Buenos Aires: Altveltlekhn yidishn kultur-kongres, 1952), 58. Halpern writes further apropos of Shomer: "The book peddlar's modern merchandise consisted of Shomer's books," p. 47. Elsewhere he writes, "The common man was attracted to Shomer's novels like a magnet. He was pulled to his books. He ran to hear a reader in someone's home. With time, this lis- tener was pulled to learn how to read a Yiddish novel himself. I remember well tens of such middle- aged, toiling Jews. They would say, 'Who knew it was so difficult to read Yiddish?' They wondered since they [already] knew how to pray [in the more elite language of Hebrew] .... In such a way, the number of Yiddish-readers rose," p. 27. See also his observations about Shomer as a westernizing or modernizing force among his readers, p. 30. 44. See Shmeruk, Sifrut yidish, 198-261. Also, David Roskies, "Ayzik-Meyer Dick and the Rise ofYiddish Popular Literature" (PhD diss., Brandeis University, 1974), 33. For a description of the five points of the ukase see pages 33-34 and David E. Fishman, "The Politics of Yiddish in Tsarist Russia," in From Ancient Israel to Modern Judaism: Intellect in Quest of Understanding: Essays in Honor ofMarvin Fox, ed. Jacob Neusner, Ernest S. Frerichs, and Nahum M. Sarna (Atlanta, GA: Schol- ars Press, 1989), 151-70. 45. Fishman makes the "censorship" case best; see Fishman, "The Politics of Yiddish In Tsarist Russia," in Frerichs and Sarna, From Ancient Israel to Modern Judaism, 151-170. Aksenfeld illustrates this point. Aksenfeld entrusted a copy of his works to his friend L. Moreinos of Odessa before he de- parted for Paris to spend the rest of his years there with his sons. In 1870, a brief article in the Odessa- based Yiddish periodical, Kol mevaser, advertised the efforts of some of Aksenfeld's admirers to pub- lish his works. They call on readers to send money in advance. "We would like to thank all those who have helped with money, effort, and hope and all those who wish the best for their people, and who will not refuse to help with money . . . to print all of [Aksenfeld's] writings including the larger novels, Friedlander (12 parts), Mikhl der ozerkes (6 parts) Elka di kvatke, Di shpiges, Sefer khsidim as well as others." See Kol mevaser 2 (1870): 15-16. His supporters had approached the St. Petersburg-based or- ganization Society for the Promotion of Jewish Enlightenment for funding, but were refused because Aksenfeld's works were not in Hebrew. For a copy of this correspondence see B. Gorin, Di geshikhte fun yidishn teater (New York: M.N. Mayzel, Idisher farlag far literatur un visenshaft, 1923), 102-104. By the time Sholem Aleichem sought them out to publish them they could not be found. This is 75</page><page sequence="16">Alyssa Quint the initial investment, or did not believe that the investment would pay off.46 Pos- sibly, publishers came to understand that such works would attract the same nar- row segment of the population whether they were published or they were circulat- ed in manuscript. We cannot know for sure. The existence of a circumscribed class of Yiddish readers that we are hypothetically considering would explain such pe- culiarities of the publishing industry. It would make sense, for instance, of the progress of the Yiddish communi- ty's first literary organ, Kol mevaser, a window onto the culture of maskilic Yid- dish-writing in general. Though its editor, Alexander Zederbaum, intended the newspaper "for the masses," there is little historical evidence that it reached an au- dience beyond an enlightened and urban rising middle-class readership. This would, doubtless, contradict Zederbaum's initial claims.47 He writes: We see according to the subscribers, that the people are very satisfied with us, and I myself am convinced, as we are also told by others, that middle-income ("mitele") people and the uneducated ("prostakes"), old people and women sitting in their stalls in the marketplace or Friday night at home, or wagon- drivers, and craftsmen, people who understand no other language and read Kol mevaser with unusual hunger, put it to their ear and their mouth, and exact great pleasure from everything they read. It would also contradict the impression of all the scholars who have studied the journal, including, most recently, Alexander Orbach, but also A. Malachi, Is- rael Zinberg, and Samuel Zitron.48 indicated by an announcement he included in the first volume of his Folksbibliotek (1888) in which he calls upon his readers to report to him if they know the whereabouts of Aksenfeld's lost manuscripts. If the censor had been the only thing standing between the publisher and the audience, then his works would have been published. I suspect other works would have been too. 46. The question demands further attention. A completely different picture presided in Vilna, where Dik could not write enough Yiddish chapbooks for the Romm Publishing House. The discrep- ancy between the expectations of the young Odessa-based publishing house and the long-established Romm family business is probably due, in part, to the fact that the Romms commanded a well-honed distribution network that reached the book peddlers who traveled among lower classes of Jews in the cities and the market towns. 47. On Kol mevaser see Israel Zinberg, "Der kol mevaser un zayn tsayt," in Kultur-historishe shtudies (New York: Grenich Printing Corp., 1949), 159-89. Zinberg offers a good discussion of the newspaper's contents and some of its history but offers nothing as to the newspaper's circulation. Malachi also offers an interesting discussion. See "Kol mevaser" [Yiddish] in Jewish Book Annual (1962): 84-94. See also Khone Shmeruk's more recent chapter on the early Yiddish press in Sifrut yidish, 261-94. 48. Samuel Leib Zitron, Di geshikhte fun der yidisherprese 1.fun yor 1863 biz 1889 (Warsaw: Ahisefer, 1923), 43. Dinezon is curiously defensive about the newspaper's role. He writes, "Kol mevas- er surely had a large number of readers and played a large role in the lives of those who read it and were awoken by it-although few people would dare admit it now," in Dinezon, Di yidishe shprakh un ir shrayber, 17. In general, the "success" in terms of readership of any maskilic journal of this time would be a difficult thing to assess given the financial subsidies that we know kept some of them running. I am assuming that Zederbaum expected his Yiddish newspaper to be financially self-sufficient because of the existence of such a large number of potential subscribers. 76</page><page sequence="17">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? But then, why did the only newspaper of its kind, with millions of potential readers, fail as early as 1871? If assessed against the founding principle of Kol mevaser, its need to shut down might have been the stuff of celebration since it would suggest that its Yiddish readers were knowledgeable enough in German (or Russian or Hebrew) to render the Yiddish newspaper obsolete.49 However, in 1871, this was hardly the case. Scholars attribute the collapse to the poor editorial staff that took over the newspaper after Zederbaum relocated to St. Petersburg, but the staff would come to include the figures ofjournalist and writer Moses Lilienblum and publisher and writer Moses Eliezer Belinson-hardly the picture of incompe- tence. Besides, Zederbaum himself touches upon the newspaper's imminent demise due to financial problems in an editorial he penned even before he quit Odessa: And so we survived for eight years in suffering, troubles. And even under the threat of death I couldn't tell you how much we accomplished in sacrificing our time, our effort, and our talent to be an uninvited do-gooder for the Peo- ple of Israel. We never considered earning a literary name in literary Yiddish and, in any case, our work [toward that end] has certainly not been rewarded. We have already lived to see the day that all the classes, even the most edu- cated, except for those that are not interested [sic] agree that Kol mevaser is the most useful newspaper to those Jews whom it has influenced [ ... ] You have nothing to be suspicious of, we are not expecting to make any profit from this, we would only like to pay for the printing, paper ... and other expendi- tures as well as our remarkable staff. Our own effort we do not account for as long as the newspaper is maintained.50 Here, Zederbaum is undoubtedly addressing like-minded maskilim-those who were never part of the paper's expressly acknowledged constituency--instead of his purported mass audience. With distress and palpable ambivalence, he admits to the newspaper's literary aspirations and the masses' rejection of his good works. In fact, the more likely explanation is that the typical Yiddish reader was not ac- quainted with the newspaper, not that it took pains to reject it.51 In any case, the 49. According to his stated program, Zederbaum intended to wean his readers from Yiddish to German, a language favored by maskilim and close to Yiddish. 50. Kol mevaser 51 (1870): 39. If the information on the newspaper's masthead is any indica- tion, Kol mevaser was regularly sold to a customer who also bought Ha-meliz. From the beginning, ad- vertisements reflect a bourgeois semi-Russified readership: all-Russian ads; ads for fashionable clothes, Russian and Hebrew books, and pianos; and ads promoting where to get a kosher meal in St. Petersburg (a city still highly restricted). Some journalists assumed that their audience was similar to themselves in having attained proficiency-if not fluency-in Russian. Popular historian Shmuel Resser, for instance, explained in 1864 that his Yiddish books were intended for children and adults who know no other lan- guage but Yiddish "even though there are so few of such [people]," Kol mevaser 40 (1864): 610-61. A bibliographical notice published in Kol mevaser in 1870 advertises a songbook of Yiddish songs in the following way: "[I]f [the songs] have any worth at all-even though we are all capable of reading Rus- sian (khotsh men layent shoyn bay undzfil rusish)--we see that when a good song is written in the lan- guage, it travels from mouth to mouth and is sung by everyone from big to small." 51. Shortly after the newspaper's demise, Zederbaum wrote an article that repeated his motiva- tions in publishing a Yiddish newspaper but also included an impassioned defense of the Yiddish 77</page><page sequence="18">Alyssa Quint strong likelihood that the newspaper did not reach much of the mass audience it apparently targeted raises not the question "Why did Kol mevaser fail?" but rather "What sustained Kol mevaser for its almost ten-year run?" The experiences of playwrights Yoel Berish Falkovitsh and Avraham Ber Gottlober shed light on this question along with aspects of the historical realities of Yiddish readership during this era. In 1864, Falkovitsh wrote his lengthy drama Khayiml der katsin (Chaim the Magnate), in which his intention to reach a Yid- dish-speaking and distinctly female audience is clearly recorded in the foreword addressed to "pious rabbis' wives and knowledgeable women."52 The well-inten- tioned Falkovitsh, who resided in St. Petersburg, a city restricted to only a small number of qualifying Jews, was in every respect out of touch with his audience. But he would not be for long. The foreword to his next drama Rokhele di zingerin (Rachel the Songstress), colored by embarrassment and defensiveness, registers the author's rude awakening. Instead of addressing pious women in his prefatory remarks, he is forced to address his fellow maskilim for the rather paradoxical task of advising them that his work is not meant for their eyes: My educated and learned friends, if once in a while you should condescend to read a booklet in Yiddish, and this drama drops into your lap, I beg you not to mock it because I wrote it, not for learned men, but for a simple audience. I know that a learned audience has read far better in living languages and need not de- rive the lessons that this book offers. I only wrote it for our unlettered masses.53 It was the last piece Falkovitsh wrote in Yiddish. Gottlober, on the other hand, was well aware that most Yiddish readers would never read his literature and that his Yiddish works were more likely to "drop into the laps" of his colleagues. So Got- tlober openly marketed his Yiddish works specifically for an audience that con- sisted of educated and multilingual readers. This is the only way of explaining his advertisement in the Hebrew Ha-meliz, in 1862, announcing a collection of his Yid- dish writings in which he concluded by stating: "These works of mine have already acquired renown and they are known to many maskilim and poets."54 Among mask- language albeit in the name of "others" who defend and even advocate the necessity of the Yiddish lan- guage. He wrote, "Those who cling to the old, cherish Yiddish as an ancient inheritance, behold it as something holy and protect it jealously [ ... ] It is to them a treasure of all that is precious in Judaism, and without it, believe, that a Jew cannot be a Jew, without it he cannot reach the erudition in studying the Talmud, and believes that none other than it can sustain the spirit that prevails among the families of Israel and within its community."

But even the bulk of 78</page><page sequence="19">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? ilic writers ofYiddish literature, some knew who their potential audience was, and others, like Falkovitsh, remained very much unenlightened. For our purposes, Falkovitsh's preface to Rokhele di zingerin's foreward is par- ticularly a historical gem. Although I have not found any published review of the drama, the above-quoted preface betrays his colleagues' open disparagement of it. It is unlikely that his critics took issue with the book's ideological complexion, which is aglow with Enlightenment instruction. Aesthetically, however, his writing was mediocre and unoriginal. In other words, to Falkovitsh's befuddlement, his col- leagues evaluated his Yiddish work with the expectation that he build upon and sur- pass the literary achievements modern Yiddish literature had accumulated to date- and they made no allowances for the fact that, by definition, as a Yiddish writer he was aiming his work at a common audience. What should artistic standards have mattered to them as they relate to Yiddish letters? By the late 1860s, so it becomes clear, high-minded Yiddish readers adopted the high-minded literary standards they absorbed from other languages. Works penned by Goldfaden, Abramovitsh, and many of their contemporaries only confirm the existence of such high expectations. Elevated literary standards had already found a home in the realm ofYiddish letters. As we approach the 1890s, Sholem Aleichem openly attests to such stan- dards in his famous diatribe against the middling literature of Shomer, Shomers mishpet (The Trial ofShomer, 1888), in which he famously pronounced Shomer's romances to be a scourge on the Yiddish readership. In his eyes, his books were no more than facile translations of foreign stories that, he argued, dulled the tastes of the Yiddish-speaking public. And he backed up his words with pages of analysis of Shomer's novels. Scholars more or less agree with Sholem Aleichem's assess- ment. To use the categories of the literary critic Northrop Frye, Shomer's work in- dulged in the "deliberately naive appeal" made by all other popular fiction: "su- perficially complicated," it resorted to "obvious and obtrusive convention" and "told his readers little that was credible about their own lives.""55 Shomer himself had no illusions about where the power of his work resided: Novels are like all other objects on the earth. They cannot please everyone equally. Some seek in novels real types and true scenes of reality. Others only want scenes of tragedy that break our heart. But the vast majority of the pub- lic demand only stories of extraordinary events.56 Kol mevaser's advertisements for belletristic works (penned in Yiddish) demonstrate that authors were not part of the more general book-selling industry; they often sold their own books from their homes. For an evaluation of Gottlober's work as a bilingual writer see Aharon Zeitlin, "Di yidish-yerushe fun di tsvey haskole-shraybers Y. L. Gordon un A.B.

This is how Northrop Frye characterizes popular literature in A Natural Perspective: The Development of Shakespeare's Comedy and Romance (New York: Columbia, 1965), 4-5.

Moreover, as it pushed its readers to learn Yiddish, to imitate the manners of its heroes, Shomer's novels spread a kind of Enlightenment. As the editor and publisher of the Folksbibliotek, which included the very best modern Yiddish literature so far produced, Sholem Aleichem came to discov- er that its audience was a relatively tiny one. In its second volume, which Sholem Aleichem published in 1889, he wrote a two-page article lambasting his fellow maskilim for ignoring the appreciable gulf that divided the common reader (or as he put it, "the marketplace") and the cosmopolitan Yiddish reader/writer (whom he labeled "Odessa"). Their oblivion was shamefully in evidence in an article penned by Linetzky (in the first volume of the Folksbibliotek), in which he had ju- bilantly described the current Yiddish literary culture as one in which the reader was finally allowed to taste from the choicest of Yiddish literary works increas- ingly available to him by way of such efforts as the Folksbibliotek. 57 It is true that one of the goals of the Folksbibliotek was to circulate works of Yiddish that had been neglected by previous publishers and hold them out to the masses of Yiddish readers. Works by some of Yiddish's most prestigious pioneer authors had not yet made it into print by 1888. There was much to celebrate. But, at least according to Sholem Aleichem's angry rebuke to Linetzky's status report entitled "Afn literarishe mark" ("At the Literary Marketplace"), Linetzky was sad- ly ill-informed. In his response, the refined Russified editor sardonically adopted the voice of a provincial resident: It is sunny here at the market, so sunny! The shutters are open, the book ped- dlers' hands are full .., .the book peddlers pack up books by the pound, every- one runs, grabs, buys, reads, and wants more (licking their chops) while the writers sit with sleeves rolled up, scratching out sentences about everything under the moon. In one word: our literary market is sunny! How nice it must be to be an optimist! [ ... ] How I envy my good-hearted friend Mr. Katsin [Linetzky's pseudonym], who wants to convince himself that Yiddish literature has begun to shed its swaddling clothes! How lucky Katsin is! He sits in "beautiful Odessa" by the great Black Sea and dreams a sweet dream. But let him take a trip down to us, in the provinces, in the small shtetls, and he will see what the "people" read, what they are raving about. [ ... ] Oh friend, what are you dreaming? Yiddish literature is still barefoot! She is naked and barefoot! And you insist that she is already beginning to throw off the swaddling clothes!58 57. Linetzky's Dos poylishe yingl might be another exception to the general rule I am laying out; it was artistically innovative (unlike Shomer) and allegedly quite popular. But it is even unclear how popular this work was in the late 1860s when it first came out. See David Goldberg's discussion of this question (including his study ofY. Reminik's article on Dos poylishe yingl) in "Yiddish Satire and the Haskalah: The case of Dos poylishe ying" (MA diss., Columbia University, 1985), chapter one. Also, see Menashe Halpern's memoirs, in which he describes Linetzky's popularity, as he initially came to know it, as stemming from an oral folk culture rather than one associated with his written work. He compares him to the famous Hershl Ostroplier. Halpern, Parmetn, 19. 58. Sholem Aleichem, ed., Folksbibliotek, (Kiev: Yakov Sheptil, 1888), 1:351-52. 80</page><page sequence="21">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? Have no doubt that in these lines Sholem Aleichem is describing the puerile state of the literature's audience. If his bitterness wasn't enough to defuse his colleagues' optimism, an accompanying ledger of books published during the previous year no doubt exerted its sobering effects. No comparison more tellingly reveals the gap between "Odessa" readers and the rest of the "literary marketplace": Sholem Ale- ichem published 3,200 copies of the Folksbibliotek, compared to the 96,000 copies of Shomer's works printed in the same year by various publishing houses. The ledger also indicated that similarly high-minded titles were published in limited numbers similar to the figure of the Folksbibliotek, that is, of one thousand copies or fewer.59 And, though Sholem Aleichem invested a great deal of money in the Folksbibliotek, offering as he did substantial remuneration to its contributors, he was bankrupt before he could issue the third volume.60 His literary endeavors alone might not have bankrupted him-Sholem Aleichem had a penchant for risky financial speculation-but at the very least they failed to generate financially prof- itable returns. The dominance of the literary landscape by a fashioner of low-grade litera- ture was not peculiar to Yiddish and, in fact, resembled the Russian popular liter- ature market of the same period, described by Jeffrey Brooks in his study, When Russia Learned to Read.61 As Brooks puts it so well, despite Marxist critics who argue that popular literature "signifies a spurious system of values imposed upon the common people by a bourgeoisie" and despite the "additional barrier of the censor, the study of popular publishing ... shows the unusually close ties between the industry and its lower-class audience, and the popular commercial authors re- vealed their independence from the censor in many ways."62 Likewise, to the cha- 59. See appendix. Sholem Aleichem, ed., Folksbibliotek (Kiev: Yakov Sheptil, 1889), 2:135- 39. These are the only seemingly comprehensive records of Yiddish publishing post-1862 that I know to exist. Compare the very small quantities in which Sholem Aleichem published part of the Folksbib- liotek (in denominations of fifty and a hundred), whereas Shomer is published in at least 1,000 to up to 6,000 copies. Folk songs (see Klibonov) are also published in large denominations and probably ap- pealed to "both" classes of readers, in so far as they existed. There is less of a discrepancy between the number of Shomer's works published individually versus, for instance, Abramovitsh's Di kliatshe (5,000 copies published), but this is attributable to Sholem Aleichem's skewed perception of the mar- ketplace. Whereas Shomer's works had been published in great quantities since at least the beginning of the decade (and so his numbers may be relied upon to be responding to market demand), Sholem Aleichem is publishing Di kliatshe for the first time (in Yiddish) since it was originally published in 1873. In general, I believe Sholem Aleichem overestimated in his publication of some parts of the Folks- bibliotek even as he was adjusting his appreciation of the marketplace reality. Another hypothesis about Di kliatshe's large number of copies may be assigned to its popularity among assimilated Jews, of which there were enough of to support such a large publication run. Though this article organizes the nine- teenth-century readers into two pools, we must keep in mind that there were more gradations in the ac- tual readership. 60.

However momentous it might have seemed, Sholem Aleichem's Folksbib- liotek was an extension of the highbrow literary culture that had already existed since the second decade of the nineteenth century. The author's indictment of Shomer-his turning up his nose at what the people wanted-likewise represent- ed a continuation of a hardened maskilic attitude towards Yiddish literature; few maskilic writers were willing to lower the standard or quality of their writing, even if it meant that they would never reach the masses they so magnanimously claimed to be writing for! Dinezon observes as much in the career of Abramovitsh: Abramovitsh has distinguished himself many times with his Yiddish work, for who does not know of The Nag (Di kliatshe, 1877) and The Little Jew (Dos yidele, 1875)? But, if Mr. Abramovitsh would excuse me, I shall say so open- ly: in both these works he has not achieved his goal. The people were not yet at the level to understand and read [these works]. [T]hese two works ... did not make their name among the masses, but, instead, among his friends, the maskilim and Hebrew writers. The people do not buy these books or read them. One out of a thousand of them understand what they are about. And I do not believe that Abramovitsh was so misled as to believe . .. that he was writing them for the masses. The question remains: for whom did he write The Little Jew and The Nag in Yiddish? I write according to what my eyes see and what my heart feels: Abramovitsh, after his triumph with The Tax, ceased being se- rious about writing in Yiddish and about the language itself. In all of his lat- est works the humor and satire are too much and too thickly painted and not even necessary .... I get the feeling that the author plays and jokes about artis- tic deformities (kunst gebrekhe), mocks, laughs, and dances on a string for his friends and fellow-writers themselves and concerns himself little with its ben- efits to the people.63 Miron notes that The Nag was the most popular of Abramovitsh's works and was read "not only among the masses but even among the intelligentsia."64 But such a statement whitewashes important questions of audience with which we are here trying to come to grips. The Nag appeared to be "popular" because it appealed to Russifying Jews of every shade of cultural assimilation, from the radically mas- kilic and firmly observant Hebraist to the "Russian-on-the-street-and-Jew-at- let's say, the Romms in Vilna: "The connection between the noncommercial publishers and their in- tended audience was always tenuous. The commercial publishers, on the other hand, had links with readers as solid as the rubles, or more appropriately, the kopecks, that changed hands in exchange for their wares," xv. 63. Dinezon, Di yidishe shprakhe un ire shraybers, 9. When Dinezon asks, "for who does not know of The Nag and The Little Jew?" it is evident from the context of his words that he poses this rhetorical question to his fellow maskilim. 64.

It did so because it played out the very compelling anxiety of the breakdown of the Russian-Jewish symbiosis on which these Russian Jews staked their lives. Such a theory would explain why the second time it was issued, in 1886, the novel was published in Polish translation. The Nag was popular not "even" among the intel- ligentsia, but, I would say, exclusively among the intelligentsia.65 V CONCLUSION From the beginning, the modern secularYiddish literature that we most iden- tify with this era was shaped, to a substantial degree, by a stratum of readers com- prised of bourgeois Jews anxious to read about their world and their people in in- ventive and challenging forms in the Yiddish language. This audience-not a mass audience-supported a robust branch ofYiddish literature that eventually claimed more and more readers, who, in return, inspired more writers, as we approach the end of the nineteenth century. The theory that there existed a stratified Yiddish au- dience is not a "magic bullet" theory that explains every peculiarity of the begin- nings of Yiddish literary culture-to the extent it was peculiar at all. The censor- ship argument explains why Abramovitsh, for instance, was not permitted to publish a Yiddish newspaper when he wanted to do so in the 1870s. (The theory might, however, imply that Abramovitsh's plan to reach a mass audience with such a journal would not have succeeded.) As well, censorship explains why Dinezon's first novel was not published-although his second novel was, and it was a com- mercial success.66 In general, however, I believe censorship to be a distraction from 65. Abramovitsh's effort to publish works intended for a mass readership was a failure, possi- bly a casualty of the conservatism that characterized the entrenched commercial Jewish publishing houses. Leo Wiener reports that in the 1870s, the book firm Eisenstadt and Schapiro commissioned Abramovitsh to write a trial translation of the Psalms as well as an updated version of traditional Sab- bath prayers and hymns. The translation of the Psalms was never published (and later lost) and the edi- tions of his recrafted Sabbath hymns were "kept out of circulation" by the Romms, "who were afraid that such an excellent translation might seriously interfere with their sale of their old, stereotyped form of the prayer-book" and Abramovitsh "was made to desist from finishing the meritorious task that he had begun." According to Wiener who was in contact with Abramovitsh, none of his early efforts to write Yiddish were successful on a popular and financial level. See, Wiener, History of Yiddish Litera- ture, 97. On the same note, recall that C.N. Bialik and Y.H. Ravnitzsky had difficulty in publishing a "complete works" edition of Abramovitsh's work in the early twentieth century, a situation that sug- gests that he still did not command a popular audience by this point. See Halifat 'igrot ben shai Abramoviz u-ven h.n. byalik ve-y.h. ravnitsky ba-shanim 1905-08. Annotated and edited by Khone Shmeruk. (Jerusalem: ha-akademyah ha-le-umit ha-yisreelit le-madaim, 1976). 66. Dinezon was convinced that Shomer's success was his fault since he wrote one of the first successful potboilers, Der shvartser yungermantshik (1870). According to Leksikon, it sold 10,000 copies. Still, we know from Dinezon's memoirs that at least part of his readership belonged to the bour- geoisie. He recounts trying to find a copy of his own book in Moscow shortly after it was published. After he tracked down a seller of Yiddish books, he discovered that the vendor had sold out his 400 copies of the book. I believe that Dinezon's audience, at this early stage of his career, was neither entirely highbrow nor as accessible as Shomer. In any case, Dinezon did not write another novel until after he became acquainted with Y.L. Peretz in 1885, and it is unclear why this is. I doubt, however, that Dinezon's fear about triggering Shomer's success had much basis in reality.

For Goldfaden's audience "catching up" was not necessary, for no one ever read his work; instead they saw it performed. Needing to read a drama made it far more inaccessible than watching it on stage. This distinctive feature of the theatre forced Goldfaden into a face-to-face encounter with the "mass audience" he and his maskilic predecessors had only imagined seated at their writing tables. While it was by no means a happy occasion, his very first encounter with "the masses" was crucial to his success as a popularizer of a distinctly modern brand of Yiddish culture. His very first live audience responded to his performance with dumb si- lence-a death sentence for any performer at the time-as Goldfaden, a practiced performer, declaimed his famous poem "Dos pintele yid." They were silent, he re- calls in his autobiography, even as he adhered strictly to the dictates of the art of declamation: But the audience was hushed. I moved to exit the stage. The audience was quiet. I exited. The audience was silent. I thought, either I don't understand this audience, or it has no passion for serious patriotic poetry ... I trotted out my poem "Di alte neshome" ["The Aged Soul"] but the audience continued its silence. By this point, the silence was painful. I moved to exit-and they whistled! And it was an angry whistle! Oh, the misfortunes I imagined that night should befall that audience! My dreams were crushed by this daft audience ["der oylem oder goylem"]; drained from my head in one blow.

Fishman asks the question: why was the development ofYiddish literature so belated or stunt- ed. I am still not convinced, however, that it suffered from any "delay." See Fishman, "The Politics of Yiddish In Tsarist Russia," in Frerichs and Sarna, From Ancient Israel to Modern Judaism, 151-70. 68. Much has been made of the connection between Yiddish and the Eastern European Jewish female reader. In general, this paper seeks to de-emphasize the gender factor in looking atYiddish read- ing during this era. My impression is that, by and large, male and female readers had similar reading habits and that the differences between them surface when considering middle-class readers and read- ers of Hebrew and other languages. According to the memoirs of Menashe Halpern, common male readers learned to read Yiddish in order to read Shomer's books and this is probably true of female read- ers as well. For a study of female Jewish reading in Eastern Europe see Iris Parush, Nashim kor'ot: yitronah shel shuliut be-khevra ha-yahadut be-mizrah eiropah be-me'ah-tsha'esrei (Tel-Aviv: Am ovad, 2001). Parush demonstrates that nineteenth-century Jewish women's social and educational marginal- ity generally increased their opportunity to learn how to read. 84</page><page sequence="25">"Yiddish Literature for the Masses"? [The popular entertainer, Israel] Grodner who stood in the wings, emerged to his familiar audience and it showed him instant respect .... (He was well acquainted with the animals and knew what appeased them) .. .69 Seldom is Goldfaden known to have taken the stage after that fateful day. But on that same day, undeterred, Goldfaden began assembling a cast of Yiddish enter- tainers, former badkhonim and folksingers like Grodner who knew how to draw a crowd. Goldfaden's rigid declamatory style was done away with as the actors' per- formances absorbed music, dance, and general buffoonery enough to compensate for-or elide completely-the more complex or sophisticated aspects of the mask- il's dramatic texts. The liberties they took did not suit every playwright that tried his hand at the craft, but Goldfaden could see past his ego to the bottom line and was, in any case, addicted to the world of entertainment.70 Finally, the encounter's greatest achievement was in showing Goldfaden that he did not know his customer as well as he thought he did for all the years he was writing Enlightenment Yid- dish literature. Finally, Goldfaden understood. It might be no accident that while Abramovitsh pities himself for turning to the feeble language of Yiddish, Gold- faden pities himself for having to pander to the Yiddish masses. The close-up ap- preciation of the common Yiddish cultural consumer that the theatre forced upon Goldfaden, and then his collaborator Shomer, ensured the sustained success of the Yiddish theatre until the government shut it down in 1883. As well, it accounts for Shomer's success as a pulp-fiction writer when he gave up producing theatre for writing novels in the late 1870s.71 Was, then, the maskilic Yiddish literary project that spanned most of the nineteenth century, "until Goldfaden and Shomer arrived in Odessa in 1879," a failure? Not really. Despite itself, it eventually produced enough writers in men like Shomer who were enormously successful in attracting readers and opening their eyes to a world beyond shtetl limits, even if it was a world plated with fanta- sy and adventure. Not only did their eyes open, but Shomer's books inspired his readers to learn how to read. In their quest (however secret) for literary excellence, in engaging Yiddish with a sense of cultural authenticity and creative ambition, 69. Goldfaden pursued Yiddish theatre for the hope of staging more sophisticated productions eventually and, more immediately, for its financial promise. See "Goldfaden's otobiografishe materi- aln mit a hakdome fun Dr. Shatski," in Goldfaden bukh (New York: Theatre Museum, 1926), 40-68. For quotation see pp. 54-55. Goldfaden rarely acted on the popular stage after that night. 70. Lilienblum was angry on discovering that the immensely popular actor Sigmund Mogule- sco wrote songs, dances, and comedy routines into his serious play, The Bigamist. "Mogulesco learned his trade in the early theatre of Goldfaden," Jacob Adler recalls in his memoirs. "He saw no reason to stick to a text." Lulla Adler Rosenfeld, The Yiddish Theatre and Jacob PI Adler (New York: Shapolsky Publishers Inc., 1988), 103-104. Lilienblum stopped writing for theatre because of this incident, ac- cording to Adler. I could not find a published or manuscript copy of The Bigamist. 71. As Shomer's daughters tell it, Shomer (who had published a couple of short novels in the mid 1870s but then gave it up) attributed the rediscovery of his metier as a pulp-fiction writer to his friendship with Goldfaden and his efforts to produce Yiddish theatre with him toward the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1878).
