<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Michael D. Swartz and Joseph Yahalom. Avodah: An Anthology of Ancient Poetry for Yom Kippur. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2005. x, 390 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000311 English translations of ancient piyyut are quite rare, if not totally lacking in contemporary Judaic studies. Tme, in the various English festival prayer books, there are piyyut translations, but in the scholarly literature, one finds only meager treatment in English of the piyyut of ancient Eretz Yisrael. Poems by Yose ben Yose, Yannai, Eleazar Kalir, and other lesser known or anonymous synagogue poets are hardly available in English. Therefore, we welcome this volume, which contains a selection of several lengthy ancient 'Avodah poems, accompanied by a careful, accurate, lucid, modem, and idiomatic English trans lation and comprehensive introduction. The book has great merits and may be considered a pioneering effort in the field. The Hebrew text, which faces the English translation, is the result of critical utilization of manuscripts, mainly from the Cairo Geniza, some of which are used for the first time in this edition. Michael D. Swartz and Joseph Yahalom's intro duction contains far more than a literary analysis and evaluation of poetic compo sitions. The authors open a window on ancient piyyut not in isolation or simply as literary artifacts but rather as a phenomenon that should be studied in light of its implications for the history of Judaism, for the understanding of its myths and symbols, for cultic history, and for the social structure of ancient Jewish society in Israel. The 'Avodah poems were composed to be recited on Yom Kippur to com memorate the actual Temple service as it had been performed by the high priest on the Day of Atonement in the Holy of Holies. The central place that these lengthy poems occupied in the Yom Kippur liturgy for centuries after the destruc tion of the Temple indicates that the role of priests in Judaism continued well beyond their actual functions in the Temple. Based on Swartz's previous research, the existence of priests as a distinct class in ancient Israel has been recognized, and in the introduction, the authors propose that the centrality of 'Avodah poems in the synagogue on Yom Kippur is just one manifestation of this distinctiveness. Quite interesting is the observation that some prominent early composers of piyyutim, including 'Avodah poems, were of priestly descent?for example, Yose ben Yose (a high priest according to legend), Shimeon ha-Kohen bar Megas, Pinehas ha-Kohen be-Rabbi Yaakov of Kifra, and Yohanan ha-Kohen be-Rabbi Yehoshua ha-Kohen. Furthermore, in the 'Avodah poems, the high priest is pre sented in a different light than in Mishnah Yoma, the source of much what we know about the Yom Kippur Temple service. In the Mishnah, the high priest is represented as passive during the preparations for the service, whereas in the poems, he appears to assume a much more active role. Most importantly, Swartz and Yahalom regard the preambles of the 'Avodah poems that tell the mythic story of creation and the chronicle of the patriarchs, culminating in the figure of Aaron the high priest, as an aspect of the emphasis in priestly circles on the Temple cult in Judaism. In the words of the authors, 178</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews "history climaxes in the institution of God's Tabernacle" (31). This stands in con trast with the midrashic view that the world was created for the sake of Torah. Thus, the authors posit that the Avodah poems are an important element in deli neating the differences between a rabbinic ideology and a priestly one. In discussing the creation and patriarchal narrative of the preambles, Swartz and Yahalom say that "the loss ofthat Temple meant the loss ofthat Presence [of God] to the world" (4). A passage from the fifth-century Pesikta de-Rav Kahana is quoted to support this idea. This Midrash describes ten stages (from the ark to the chemb, and so on) through which the Divine Presence ascended to heaven after the Temple's destruction. Another statement from the same source comes to mind in this connection. We read in the Pesikta de-Rav Kahana (ed. Mandelbaum, 2-3; Braude's and Kapstein's translation, 5-6), "At the beginning of time ... the root of the Presence was fixed in the regions of earth below. After Adam sinned, the Presence withdrew to the first heaven. The generation of Enosh arose: they sinned; the Presence withdrew from the first heaven to the second ... Over against these wicked men [seven generations] seven righteous men arose and brought it about that the Presence came back to earth." To some extent, this state ment, in its entirety, parallels the narrative of the Avodah preambles, in which the history of biblical heroes and generations is told in terms of their sins as well as their righteous acts, leading up to the return of the Presence to the Tabernacle. Accordingly, the epic telling of the chronicle of the world becomes a fitting intro duction to the description of the service of the high priest in the Temple on Yom Kippur and the seven-day period of preparation prior to that day. The authors' selection of the Avodah texts out of the many in existence is felicitous. There are nine Avodah texts in the book. They include the anonymous prose Avodah, Shiv 'at Yamim, which probably is the first Avodah ever written for inclusion in the Yom Kippur service. Shiv 'at Yamim follows Mishnah Yoma quite closely, although with some omissions and some original embellishments. It also incorporates additions from other sources and traditions. From this early prose ren dition, the transition to the first anonymous poetic Avodah, Atah bar a 'ta is quite natural. The authors suggest that Atah bara 'ta is a poetic introduction to the prose of Shiv 'at Yamim. The first fully poetic treatment of the Temple service for litur gical purposes is an anonymous composition, Atah konanta, which is still used in some liturgies. Two other anonymous compositions follow: the highly elaborate, artistic, sophisticated, rich, and very lengthy poems Az be'en kol (793 lines!) and Aromem la- 'el. These two texts occupy the bulk of the book. They are also the richest in their use of poetic devices, as well as in preserving myths and symbols from known and unknown sources. These two texts receive the most thorough treatment in the introduction. These 'Avodah poems, with an elaborate introduction and extensive commentary, were first published in 1996 in Yahalom's book Az be 'en kol (Priestly Palestinian Poetry: A Narrative Liturgy for the Day of Atonement). In the book under review, the text was complemented by a newly dis covered manuscript. Also in 1996, Shalom Spiegel's posthumous Avot ha-piyyut appeared, edited by the present writer, containing a large part of these poems with Spiegel's commentary (17?40). Neither Spiegel nor the editor recognized the proper connection and sequence between the various parts of the composition, 179</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews with its multiple alphabetical acrostics. Still, for students who are interested in even small textual and exegetical details, a mention of Spiegel's work might have been helpful. Three poetic 'Avodot by Yose ben Yose, the first author of piyyutim known by name, and a poem based on the ancient apocryphal book, Ben Sira, close the volume. In their discussion of literary technique, the authors deal with the ornaments of the text, as well as parallelism, alliteration, allusion, and metonymy (in Hebrew kinnu?), through which the name of a person or a thing is substituted by a descrip tive word or phrase. Swartz and Yahalom do the contemporary reader a great favor by printing such words and phrases in the translation column in bold type and by deciphering them in the margin in the same type. This makes the text easily intelligible at first glance. The authors stress the importance of the 'Avodah poems to our knowledge of the sources of certain mythological and symbolic elements. The majority of the sources are, of course, found in rabbinic literature, but among them, there are numerous ideas that are preserved only in nonrabbinic texts, that is, in the Apoc rypha, Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, and other Hellenistic Jewish literature. Interestingly, the authors suggest that the eight- or ninth-century midrash Pirqe de Rabbi Eliezer may have been influenced by 'Avodah poems. If there can be any criticism of this very rich and rewarding book, which opens up new vistas on a much-neglected branch of Hebrew literature, it is that the commentary is in some places too spare. Some technical inconsistencies, such as a lack of numbering of the poetic lines on some pages (e.g., 99 and 101) could easily be corrected in a second edition.
