Saved by the bell, as it were, your bad book may not be noticed. (Or is it better to be embar- rassed than ignored?) Now come two books that deal with Israel-Diaspora relations, that are both ill-timed: written before, but published after, the current intifada, and able to deal with these latest events with only polite acknowledgement rather than as a serious challenge to their arguments. But although both are ill-timed, and must be held blameless for that, only one is also ill-tempered. Professor Jerold Auerbach, who early on "dreamed of a white Christmas" and "hunted for Easter eggs," came upon Israel and Zionism some three decades ago, near his fortieth birthday. With all the zeal of a convert, he now wields his faith like a hammer, and his is more screed than book, largely indifferent to facts that stand in the way of his pre-Zionist analysis. Yes, "pre-Zion- ist," perhaps even more simply anti-Zionist. Auerbach is furious with Zionism in general, with secular Zionism in particular. He thinks himself a defender of Israel, but the Israel he defends never was and never will be. On one hand, he criticizes all those liberal Zionists who have from time to time expressed disappointment with Israel's departure from liberal norms; on the other, he castigates Zionism for its departure from Auerbach's own norms. He comes not to praise Zionism, but to bury it. (His praise is reserved for the settlers and their settlements.) For in his view, the choice that Israel-and Jews more generally-must make is the fateful choice between Zionism and Judaism, and Auerbach is relentlessly on the side of Judaism. "[T]here is," he tells us, "a fundamental, perhaps irreconcilable tension between Zionism, a revolutionary political movement in pursuit of normalization, and Ju- daism, the distinctive faith tradition of the Jewish people-a people, according to the biblical text ... destined to dwell alone, set apart from the other nations of the world" (pp. 113-114). "The journey of the modern Jews," as he sees it, "is from emancipation through Zionism to assimilation" (p. 220). Period, end of story Now, although Auerbach invariably misses the nail despite his relentless hammering-and one has the sense that he gets carried away into a kind of man- ic hammering because he is desperate for contact-he does have one solid under- lying point. It is the same point that has been made by virtually every thoughtful analyst of Jewish life since the Emancipation, for the Emancipation is still the great challenge to Jewish life. What, in fact, can and should it mean to be a Jew in a free society, a society in which the individual is encouraged to make his or her own choices? And what are the prospects of the Jews in such an environment? To that standard question, Auerbach's answer is fealty to Torah-which "is hardly the founding text for freedom of choice and liberal politics." Whether feal- 362</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ty to Torah means more to him than hostility to liberalism is hard to say; he ap- parently does not see much difference between the two. Others among us may think the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community an offense not only against Zionism, which they explicitly choose to be, but also against Judaism, which they preserve in its purest cultic aspects, but for Auerbach they are "in the end a living reminder of everything Jewish that Zionists assumed they had defeated in their struggle with the rabbis for Jewish cultural supremacy in the modem era" (p. 204). Not for Auer- bach pastels, much less shades of gray; his truths are loud and bitter, even garish. As if to add insult to injury, he breathlessly fills his argument with unattributed, unfootnoted quotations. Thus, for example, he faults American Jews who move to Israel for bringing vestiges of their Americanness with them, whether in the form of a penchant for softball or a commitment to civil liberties, "characteristically American in its Jewish shallowness" (p. 70). Indeed, he goes on for some pages in an effort to portray (the erstwhile) American fascination with the kibbutz as deriving from the consonance of the kib- butz with the American historical experience. "When halutz (pioneering) values were taught to American youngsters, their sources in European socialist theory were conveniently overlooked. Instead, the kibbutz became the embryonic expres- sion of (American) democracy, justice, and equality" (pp. 66-67). Perhaps that is so. The relevant passages are dotted with quotation marks, and it is hard to imag- ine that Auerbach has manufactured the quotes. But alas, the book lacks any notes, so we are left in the dark as to the source of the quoted material. His notion that American youngsters were taught about the kibbutz by reference to the Green Mountain Boys is a "fact" entirely unfamiliar to me, and at sharp odds with my own experience in precisely the socialist Zionist youth movement Auerbach choos- es to discuss and lambaste. We of Habonim were never as rigorous in our socialist studies (or practice) as our colleagues in Hashomer Hatzacir, but we were sharp critics of American society, and smart enough to know the difference between soft- ball and Joe McCarthy. The kibbutz, as we encountered it, came to us from Isaiah, A.D. Gordon, and Yosef Baratz, not from Thoreau and much less from the several American utopian experiments. The product of all this mishmash is a collection of factoids and errors in ser- vice of a pristine theory that has about as much relevance to the life of the Jews as does the politics of Micronesia. So, Auerbach depicts the American Jewish com- munity as cravenly seeking to be taken as full-fledged Americans, hence caving in whenever an American administration chooses to oppose, pressure, or in any oth- er way be critical of Israel. This is essential to his critique of American Jewry as fundamentally assimilationist. He tells us, for example, that President George Bush (the elder) and Secretary of State James Baker successfully "all but battered" the American Jewish community "into silent submission" (p. 109). He thereby ig- nores-one must assume willfully, since even the casual observer could not have been deaf to it-the chorus of protests the Bush-Baker team consistently elicited from that "battered into submission" community. Again and again, the behavior of the American Jewish community is thus either misreported or caricatured, for noth- ing must stand in the way of the theory. What Auerbach just doesn't get is that those with whom he disagrees are not 363</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews necessarily self-hating Jews blinded by their liberalism, and that his own "logic" can easily, perhaps even must easily, lead to places even he himself finds noxious. So, for example, he faults the historian Benny Morris for suggesting that Israel was born in the original sin of the "willful dispossession of Palestinian Arabs from their land" (p. 178). Nonsense, says Auerbach; only tiny groups on the right-wing fringe of Israeli politics have ever, then or now, supported the "transfer" of Israel's Arabs. In truth, he contends, it is only the Zionists of the left who endorse "transfer," in this case the transfer of the Jews from West Bank settlements. Auerbach is inven- tive, so perhaps if he were writing today, he would find a creative way to explain away that the transfer of Arabs is the explicit policy of Effie Eitam, head of the Na- tional Religious Party and a member of the current Israeli cabinet. It may well have passed Auerbach's notice, but endorsement of transfer is no longer regarded as a proposal of the fringe; it is, in fact, a perfectly logical implication of the Judaism iiber alles logic that Auerbach himself advances-a logic based on a most ten- dentious reading of Judaism's sacred texts. Oh yes, and peace. Peace? Forget it. A "delusion," since the "tribal animos- ity" between Moslems and Jews is "ineradicable" (p. 214). Steven Rosenthal is a Zionist of a very different color, most especially one who does not feel compelled, as does Auerbach, to caricature those with whom he disagrees. Unfortunately, he shares with Auerbach one irritating lapse; though his book is duly footnoted, very many of his quotations are not. They are left dangling, without source. His errors-and there are very, very many of them-are not for the most part major errors of interpretation, but the kinds of small factual mistakes that inevitably raise questions regarding the author's credibility. It is not the "Coun- cil of Presidents" but the Conference of Presidents, and it is either the American Zionist Movement or the Zionist Organization of America, but not the "American Zionist Organization" and there is none. It is not the "American Friends Commit- tee," but the American Friends Service Committee; Norman Podhoretz's office at Commentary was not on Park Avenue, it was on 56th Street; Peace Now was found- ed not "shortly after the conclusion of the 1973 war" but five years later; the Jew- ish Council on Public Affairs (then the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council) was determinedly not "a pro-Pollard group;" there is no news- paper called the Boston Star; Al Vorspan is not now and never was "Rabbi" Albert Vorspan; Moment magazine's first consideration of the desirability of a Palestin- ian state was published in 1975, not in 1988; Seymour Reich was (and is) a promi- nent Jewish lay leader, but never was "the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee;" the "arrival" of American Jews is marked not by "six United States senators and 15 congressmen," but by ten senators (sometimes nine) and 35 or so (depending on which Congress) congressmen. And so forth. As to interpretation, Rosenthal's is a bit too sunny. He writes as Oslo seems ripe for full implementation, and so positions the American Jewish community as much more coherently opposed to the Begin/Shamir policies than was in fact the case. He cites, for example, the Levin-Metzenbaum letter to Yitzhak Shamir (1988) on the eve of a Shamir meeting with President Reagan as evidence of the aware- ness of American politicians that American Jewish support for Shamir's policies 364</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews had fallen, and ignores the furious backlash the letter provoked, a backlash that has echoed through the years as an inhibition against Congressional criticism of Israel. From the standpoint of Israel-Diaspora relations, that particular Shamir trip was in fact a triumph. More generally, one wonders what Rosenthal can have had in mind in refer- ring to the "liberal policies of Ben Gurion and Eban" (pp. 180-181), since what- ever the reasons to honor Abba Eban-and there are many-affecting the policies of Israel's government is assuredly not among them. What we have here is a well-intentioned book, a book that also and inevitably takes up the question of the Jewishness of the Jewish state-though it comes to rest in a very different place from Auerbach's book-but that cannot, for all its good intentions, be taken as definitive. The real question is whether it can even be taken seriously, since the road it travels is so rutted, so filled with potholes, large and small. It is hard to see the forest when so many of the trees are missing. Fear not, however: Next season, there will be two or four or eight or perhaps sixteen more books on the subject. They, too, will, whether explicitly or implicit- ly, take the Emancipation as their starting point; they, too, will try to characterize the fractious American Jewish community with a few sweeping generalizations; they, too, will be outdated by the time they appear; they, too, will stumble over the difficulties of deciding whether they are writing about the Jewish organizations of the Diaspora and their leaders or about amcha, the Jewish people. The sometimes stormy, sometimes happy, always complicated relationship between Israel and the Diaspora will doubtless survive them all. Leonard Fein Boston, Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
