Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2002. 331 pp. Tamar El-Or has given us a book that could benefit from the layout of the Talmudic pages that provide the text for the women's studies she has researched. Using her observations as base, she develops multiple perspectives that go well beyond the usual anthropological ethnography, adding layer upon layer of interpretation and perspective. The book begins with a survey and description of the institutes of religious higher learning for women in Israel at the time of her data collection (late 1990s); continues with the presentation and analysis of her interviews with 40 (out of 1,300) female students at Bar-Ilan University's Midrasha (women's institute of religious higher learning) about their development as religious "learners"; presents the results of her three years of participant obser- vation in classrooms at the Midrasha; and concludes with an interpretation of the data from the perspective of "literacy," which is seen in the anthropological literature as a central facet of societal participation, and its implied meanings for gender relations among Jews (at least among the Orthodox). On the most descriptive level, she provides a window into the new and developing phenomenon of young (modern) Orthodox women studying in 212</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews institutions of higher learning, parallel to the institutions of higher religious learning that have historically been traditional for Orthodox Jewish males. Repro- ducing many of the narratives of the women themselves, she amplifies their own perspectives on their "literacy biographies" in terms of their past, present, and future lives. But she goes beyond the individual women to analyze what this new opportunity that is developing by and for women means in terms of Jewish religion, Jewish tradition, and Jewish studies on a collective level, suggesting that the very participation of women in such settings as the Midrasha challenges and opens up the traditional religion and religious education in ways that have wide-reaching ramifications. Framing some of the discussion in terms of the "border crossing" (a I a Giroux) that is being accomplished, El-Or suggests that "the broadening of the circle of observers and actors is in itself a social change" (195), and, following Boyarin's thesis that "sacred studies" have been a bastion of masculine identity construction for Jewish males, suggests that women's widening participation is challenging the very construction of Jewish gender roles (197-98). Women's involvement in such studies, partially because of its voluntary nature and partially because of feminine attributes, also opens the studies to more emotional engagement than has been traditional among males, often providing a pedagogical challenge to educators. Presenting her observations of several classroom settings, El-Or analyzes the pedagogical styles and dilemmas of the Midrasha context, placing them in the context of Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed as well as Lave and Wenger's "situated learning," among others. Ostensibly, the goal of the Midrasha and comparable women's institutes is to present the material in a systematic way that provides women tools to put their learning into proper textual (not only the- matic) context (as religious education for males has long done), with the eventual potential of becoming masters of their own learning. However, the classroom observations show that this is not uniform even at the Midrasha, a cause for com- plaint on the part of some of the women. Yet another level is reached as El-Or documents how education cannot be divorced from the external political and cultural context, both because of the edu- cators' awareness and the students' concerns and their interaction. She reflexively demonstrates how the public penetrates the private-and to some extent, vice versa-for the individual learners, the classroom sessions, and herself in the research process, especially as she poignantly relates the effect the Rabin assassi- nation had on her as she wrote the book. External cultural conflicts are never far from the surface in the educational encounters she describes. The book is a fascinating reflection on the research process itself, raising important questions facing the anthropological discipline about applied vs. "pure" research and postmodern considerations. It is also a frank discussion that applies multiple meanings of feminism, both from the point of view of the researcher and those observed (whether or not they identified themselves as "femi- nists"). More generally, it illuminates the micro processes by which macro social change takes place, repeatedly raising the question of whether this is a revolution or evolution and showing how what has once been considered "radical" is now becoming "normal," at least in some circles. Much of the change is taking place 213</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews within traditional infrastructures, and she respectfully presents the rationale for such developments. The book ends with a peek at future developments as women's sacred literacy becomes institutionalized and as more and more women incorporate the modem orientation toward enlightenment into their identities, expecting to "know more" next Pesach than they did the year before. Anyone with an interest in the intersection of gender and Judaism, modernity and Judaism, postmodernism and anthropology, the development of modem Orthodoxy, or the educational process itself will derive much stimulation from this book.
