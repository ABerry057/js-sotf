Between the partitions of Poland in the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the First World War, tsarist law restricted Jewish residence almost exclusively to the Pale of Jew- ish Settlement, an administrative unit that encompassed the Western borderlands of the empire. In Jewish memory, this confinement was not merely geographic but cultural and social; reference to the Pale evokes a sense of isolation from Russia proper inflicted from the outside by effective legal discrimination and buttressed from within by the force of tradition. The only way for Jews to leave the Pale pre- sumably involved either emigrating or opting out of Judaism altogether. For some, conversion to Christianity relieved all of the burdens of communal authority and juridical disability associated with the Pale. For others, the turn to the universal faiths of the nineteenth century-Enlightenment, socialism, Marxism-constituted an 301</page><page sequence="2">Olga Litvak analogous act of departure. The reduction of the Russian-Jewish experience to simple contrasts may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that until a decade ago historians were forced to rely on anecdotal literary evidence; archival materi- als remained hidden behind the iron curtain. Four recent studies attribute their own historiographic departure from the pale directly to the availability of documentary sources that bring to light a variety of possibilities for defying the internal and ex- ternal constraints of the Pale without abandoning one's Jewishness in the process. This essay examines some of the ways in which new sources have inspired new arguments that make room for a range of Russian-Jewish experience and ex- pression far broader than the limited set of radical choices between piety and apos- tasy, political quietism and revolutionary zeal. Each of the authors locates the Archimedean point of Russian-Jewish history neither in nor out of the Pale but at different points of contact between individual, state, and society; between Rus- sianness and Jewishness. In Mordechai Zalkin's social history of the Russian Haskalah, the learned elite represent a critical nexus between continuity and change, an instrumental force in the domestication of enlightenment. Chae Ran Freeze, in her groundbreaking study of Jewish marital breakdown in late imperial Russia, ar- gues that for Russian-Jewish men and women the struggle with modernity took place not only in the public spaces of synagogue, schoolhouse, and marketplace but also in the privacy of the bedroom and in the civic arena of divorce court. Drawing his subject into the orbit of imperial historiography, Benjamin Nathans focuses his powerful analytical lens on Russia's northern capitol, the site that occasioned and shaped the encounter between Russia and its Jews in the drawing rooms of Jewish merchant notables, at the Russian bar, and in the university. Carole Balin uncovers a body of work by Jewish women writers for whom literature provided a crucial av- enue of escape from the regime of sexual discipline that extended the psychologi- cal reach of the Pale from the Russian map into the Jewish mind. Zalkin's subject, the origins of the Jewish Enlightenment in the prereform period and its impact on the life of the "ordinary person" (p. 9), anticipates chrono- logically and thematically some of the central issues in the making of late imper- ial Russian-Jewish life that Nathans and Freeze flesh out more fully. Zalkin discusses the relationship between the state and Jewish communal authorities; the importance of local and regional loyalties; the role of the family; and the interplay between ideas and social life; factors which, he argues, informed the development of the Haskalah to a far greater extent than a common ideology or a shared inter- est in neoclassical Hebrew. Moving away from conventional depictions of the Haskalah as a literary movement, Zalkin considers the Russian-Jewish enlight- enment as an incremental shift in the manners and mores of a much greater pro- portion of people than the small number of writers and poets usually associated with the literary turn in Eastern European culture. In light of this premise, Zalkin reconsiders the question of chronology, focusing on the first half of the nineteenth century rather than on the literary efflorescence of the 1860s. Echoing Stanis- lawski's Tsar Nicholas I and the Jews (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1983), Zalkin locates the formative era of enlightenment in the 1820s through the 1840s, the period identified with maskilic institution-building and the ongoing process of social, economic, and cultural differentiation of Russian Jewry. 302</page><page sequence="3">New Trends in the Study of Russian Jewry Zalkin describes this gradual turn as a "silent enlightenment" (pp. 23-42); in his view, the private absorption of values associated with the Haskalah laid the groundwork for the self-conscious articulation of enlightenment ideas, driven by a post-1860s radical agenda of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia. According to Zalkin, this silent enlightenment was a far broader and more conservative move- ment that replicated, rather than undermined, the constitution of Jewish commu- nal life and the attendant divisions between rich and poor, as well as the regional differences and cultural gaps. Zalkin posits a dialectical link between tradition and modernity, expressed in the preservation of stable social structures newly endowed with a moderately reformist, practical sensibility at odds with the utopian vision promoted in enlightenment criticism, autobiography, and belles-lettres. For exam- ple, marriage connections and regional ties among Jewish learned elites served as an effective filter of enlightened ideas and cemented the social hierarchy; this, de- spite the programmatic literary emphasis on romantic love and the alienation of the enlightened individual from Jewish society. Similarly, the idea of produc- tivization failed to inspire an economic revolution in Jewish life even among the enlighteners themselves; their occupational profile remained largely rooted in tra- ditional commercial pursuits. Most significantly, for all the emphasis on the cre- ation of parallel educational institutions and the echo of similar sentiments, the Russian Haskalah never coalesced into a distinct movement that advocated the liberation of the individual from the sway of money, status, and education. Mod- erated by the process of accommodation with traditional society, the Jewish en- lightenment in Russia did not produce an alternative community, a Hebrew republic of letters, until enlightenment values were comfortably ensconced in the well-appointed parlors of the rich and pious. Like revisionist histories of Hasidism, which similarly emphasize its conser- vative character, Zalkin's new history of the Haskalah overstates social continuity at the expense of ideological innovation. Zalkin's functional analysis is so focused on enlightenment as a process that he misses Enlightenment as a milestone in the history of ideas; however indirect or dialectical, the relationship between the for- mer and the latter goes beyond the merely instrumental. The insufficiency of Za- Ikin's model to account for the way ideas shape reality manifests itself with particular urgency in his treatment of the book, a singularly useful marker of the indissoluble tie between matter and spirit. Zalkin surveys the eclectic content of maskilic libraries and asserts that books occupied a prominent place in the world of enlightenment but says nothing about their content and their increasing impor- tance as cultural artifacts, much less about enlighteners either as readers or as writ- ers. Wreathed in the smokescreen of generalities, Zalkin's view of books leave the reader wanting more than the following uninspired and unsubstantiated claim: "From everything stated above, the central place of the book in the world of the Eastern European enlightener clearly emerges. In many cases, this was the youth's start of the road toward enlightenment, and in later stages, became an important means of expressing one's religious, social and cultural worldview ... .The vari- ety of books that occupied many bookshelves--prose, poetry, exegetical com- mentary, scholarship, translations, historiography, and so forth-testifies to the wide variety of readers of a wide variety of social, intellectual and cultural orien- 303</page><page sequence="4">Olga Litvak tations" (pp. 254-255). Here, Zalkin might have taken a page directly from the in- creasingly sophisticated reassessments of Hasidism as an ideological revolution reified and domesticated in socially conservative terms; Zev Gries' work on books as a critical nexus between the explosive impact of Hasidic ideas and their social accommodation comes immediately to mind. Zalkin's model of silent enlightenment most clearly serves his discussion of Vilna, where the Haskalah never lost its vital connection with the study house. Vil- na enlighteners remained solidly rooted in local society, especially at the level of the yeshivah elite, where marriage ties strengthened the connections between the former and the latter. Vilna's enlightened notables always occupied positions of power on the governing board of the community and at times of famine and epi- demic closed ranks with their more traditional counterparts. In this atmosphere of intramural co-operation, ideological conflicts took on the character of a family squabble that preserved the Vilna ecosystem from the incursions of secularism and apostasy, on the one hand, and the powerful attraction of Hasidism, on the other. Vilna established an active precedent for the naturalization of enlightenment, and lent its imprimatur to the dominant cultural style of the formative years of the Haskalah. Ironically, the most effective challenge to the sway of this Lithuanian "Jerusalem" arose out of the logic of enlightenment itself. The emphasis on eco- nomic restructuring, social respectability, and intellectual achievement helped to lead substantial numbers of young Jewish men away from provincial maskilic cir- cles to Russian universities. By the 1860s, the scene changed dramatically with the gradual emergence of the diplomaed intelligentsia; Vilna gave way to St. Peters- burg as the locus of Jewish aspirations toward modernity. Here, Nathans picks up the story precisely where Zalkin leaves off. In his elegant and meticulously documented account, resting upon a solid foundation of archival and published sources, Nathans argues that the Russian- Jewish encounter is best viewed from "beyond the pale," that is, from St. Peters- burg; closed to Jewish residence throughout the imperial period, the northern capi- tol contained a Jewish community composed entirely of individual "exceptions" distinguished by the state for their educational, commercial, or military achieve- ments. For Nathans, such exceptions effectively prove the rule that governed the making of Russian-Jewish experience in the late imperial period. Nathans' St. Petersburg represents the imperial fishbowl, where Jewish emancipation as policy and Jewish emancipation as process most visibly converged. In both instances, emancipation remained partial or selective. Whereas the policy privileged person- al accomplishment at the expense of collective discipline, the process fostered not the total displacement of Jewish identity by Russian loyalty but the articulation of a highly acute individual Jewish consciousness. Informed by a fundamental ten- sion between the legal categorization of Jews as an estate and a confession, the se- lective emancipation of individual Russian Jews promoted specific ways of identifying with a variety of imperial subcultures: professional or civic arenas where Jews and non-Jews met on a more or less equal footing. Unlike the act of emancipation into a nation-state, partial emancipation did not serve the creation of a single Russian Jewry but, rather, exacerbated the stratifying effects of eco- nomic dislocation and cultural change that began to transform Jewish society in 304</page><page sequence="5">New Trends in the Study of Russian Jewry the first half of the nineteenth century. In fact, as Nathans amply demonstrates, partial emancipation was a product of cooperation between the government of the reforming tsar and St. Petersburg's newly minted Jewish notables, joined in the at- tempt to control the floodtide of social change without relinquishing the potential economic and cultural benefits of modernization. Nathans turns to St. Petersburg as "a laboratory of selective integration" (p. 83), in which the Russian-Jewish encounter anticipated and intensified the ambiguous effects of the unserfment (Rus. raskreposhchenie) of Russian society upon Jewish lives throughout the empire. St. Petersburg's Jews exhibited an intense interest in secular education and a prodigious degree of literacy in Russian, as well as an acute sense of class conflict, communal dissonance, and intergenerational tension. Many entered professional ranks and many engaged in criminal behavior. Indeed, St. Petersburg Jews were like their counterparts within the Pale, only, it seems, more so. Formed by government fiat and highly self-conscious of its own visibility, the Jewry of St. Petersburg exemplified Dostoevsky's contemporary characterization of the city by being the most "deliberate" Jewry in the world. Most of the founders of the St. Petersburg Jewish community immigrated to the capitol and spent their lives struggling to shed the cultural vestiges of their provinciality. In the period covered by Nathans, the city saw the passing of the fathers-the pa- triarchs of the community-and the rise of the sons, increasingly at home beyond the Pale. This shift illuminates the transition to the second part of the book, where the experience of the second generation of St. Petersburg Jews, graduates of Rus- sian universities and members of the Russian bar, becomes paradigmatic of the cul- tural advance of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia (p. 232). The bar and the university constituted highly privileged sites of interethnic contact, wherein the policy of selective integration produced its most dramatic re- sults. Like St. Petersburg itself, such sites owed their existence directly to the gov- ernment's active commitment to the modernization of the empire and to the ambivalence towards the costs of personal emancipation that this drive helped to unleash. Nathans looks closely at the ways in which this ambivalence expressed it- self in limits upon Jewish integration and analyzes its effect on the evolution of Russian-Jewish consciousness. The sense of incomplete merger produced not alienated Jewish Russians but, rather, Russian Jews who articulated their specifi- cally Jewish grievances, concerns, and interests in a Russian idiom. The most suc- cessful beneficiaries of the attempt from above to transform imperial Russia into a modern Rechtsstaat, Jewish lawyers played a disproportionately large part in cre- ating the political vocabulary and the cultural ethos of modern Russian Jewry. Le- gal discourse laid the foundation for Russian-Jewish historiography, shaped the Jewish struggle for collective emancipation, and provided an ideological basis for Jewish citizenship in Russia. In these ways, Russian-Jewish lawyers both lived and articulated a new kind of Jewishness, enabled and constituted by the state. Nathans' seamless narrative effectively substitutes the part for the whole. St. Petersburg acts as a stand-in for other imperial cities, Jewish students for Jewish youth culture, and Jewish lawyers for other Jewish professionals. Implicitly, the paradigm drawn beyond the Pale informs a radical revision of the Pale itself. But quite as much as Zalkin in his view of Vilna as exemplary of the maskilic experi- 305</page><page sequence="6">Olga Litvak ence, Nathans overtaxes the metonymic approach to history. There are, at every point of Nathans' story, a variety of possibilities for the construction of Russian- Jewish identity and for an understanding of the Russian-Jewish encounter. It is true that aspects of life in Jewish St. Petersburg also characterized Jewish life in other urban centers both in and out of the Pale; but unlike Western European na- tion-states, imperial Russia had more than one capitol, all of which made their own distinctive claims on Jewish leadership and on Jewish culture. Odessa was no less cosmopolitan than St. Petersburg, and Moscow no less Russian, yet both cities were defined precisely by their distance from Russia's northern metropolis. It is equally true that university students embodied the aspirations of a new generation of Jewish youth to move beyond the Pale, but what about cultural alternatives that competed with the secular bourgeois ambitions of the diplomaed intelligentsia? Jewish nationalism and Jewish traditionalism exemplified other forms of the Rus- sian-Jewish encounter, rooted in the realities of Jewish provincial life. Lawyers did play a disproportionate part in asserting the political and cultural claims of Russian-Jewish selfhood, but there were other intellectual figures who were no less articulate: Jewish authors, for instance, wrote their way beyond the Pale. Their imaginative revisions of Jewish past and present challenged the juridical perspec- tive on Russian-Jewish history and on the meaning of the Russian-Jewish en- counter. Arguably, the fictions of Sholem-aleichem and S. J. Abramovich informed the search for Russian-Jewish selfhood no less than the legal treatises of Ilia Or- shanskii. Ultimately, the move beyond the Pale was not a direct, one-way trip. On the one hand, Jewish nostalgia continually demanded the recreation of the Pale in art, literature, and history. On the other hand, the railroad, the newspaper, and the telegraph rendered the boundaries of the Pale increasingly permeable, despite juridical restrictions on Jewish residence. The missing links in Nathans' study felicitously demonstrate that the royal historiographical road toward a more nu- anced history of Russian Jewry runs not only through St. Petersburg but also through more sophisticated histories of the provinces. This is the salient method- ological point of Freeze's pioneering work on Jewish marriage and divorce in im- perial Russia. Freeze effectively uses the tools of social history to analyze the role of Jew- ish and Russian law in the making and unmaking of the Jewish family in the late imperial period. Relying on the sociological model developed by Jacob Katz, con- ventional treatments of this subject drew on prescriptive literature and idealized fictional representations to depict the family as the preserve of Jewish affective and communal ties against the incursions of modernity, the locus of tradition in a world shaken by crisis. Freeze marshals an entirely different set of sources to demonstrate that Jewish family practices defy such simplistic ideological distinc- tions. The imbrication of public and private in the way Jewish men and women tied and untied the knots that bound them to one another reveals that what went on with- in the Pale was in every way tied to what went on in Russian courts and chancel- leries. At the same time, the development of Russian administrative and juridical practice with regard to the Jews was thoroughly informed by the importance of Ha- lakhah not as an antisemitic caricature of Jewish pettifoggery, but as living letter. Freeze has mined the archives to bring to light the intimate life of Russian 306</page><page sequence="7">New Trends in the Study of Russian Jewry Jewry in all of its provincial particularity. She ushers the state into the Pale not as a political abstraction or an unrelenting force ofjudeophobia but, rather, as an active participant in the lives of ordinary people. In many instances, the state, embodied in concrete encounters between Jewish persons and Russian judges, lawyers, and bu- reaucrats, could be mobilized as a source of individual empowerment against com- munal discipline. Still more paradoxically, Jewish petitioners often presented their cases in ways that compelled the state to act in defense of Jewish piety. This scenario makes it refreshingly difficult to tell where the Pale ended and Russia began. Freeze begins with the proposition that the state's attempt to bring order into traditional marital practices required the systematic "disordering" of existing com- munal norms in the name of greater social homogeneity. This goal grew ever more elusive as the administration supported a variety of new ways of justifying dis- obedience in the name of reform, undermining those very same communal au- thorities-rabbis and lay leaders-upon whom the state relied for maintaining social discipline. The state's solution to this problem of insufficient and contra- dictory governance was to introduce an alternative rabbinic hierarchy meant to act as the exclusive agent of state authority on the ground. Characteristically, its most important duties concerned the regulation of Jewish family life, the seedbed of chaos that, according to both government reports and to Jewish reformers, plagued Russian-Jewish society. As Freeze demonstrates, however, the dual role of the crown rabbis as both the "supervisors and interpreters of Jews law" and as state servitors (p. 95) deepened the contradiction implicit in the state's interventionist policy. How were crown rabbis to exercise their dual function when Jewish law and custom violated the administrative and ideological demands of their position as ex- ecutors of Russian law, especially when the universal juridical authority of the lat- ter vitiated the effective local exercise of the former? In the fissures between the two legal systems, Jewish men and women found an unexpected source of personal freedom from all social norms, to construct a kind of rogue view of Jewish per- sonhood beyond the pale of both communal control and the limits of the state's ability to police its vast heterogeneous population. The conflict produced rabbinic "entrepreneurs" like the notorious crown rabbi Kagan of Nikolaev, skilled at ma- nipulating the dual administration of marriage and divorce in order to emancipate his clients-male and female-from the system of collective responsibility, reli- gious obligation, and residential restriction that defined Jewish life within the Pale of Settlement. Such peculiar freedom both empowered the Jewish individual and left him or her-especially her-vulnerable to the element of arbitrariness en- demic to the system. Seeking redress against the potential and actual corruption of Jewish authority, an increasing number of ordinary Russian Jews turned to the state to effect their own emancipation from Jewish society in the name of Jewish piety. For many, this move beyond the Pale involved a turn toward a more acute sense of their own Jewish self-consciousness; they appealed to the state in the name of Jew- ish principles that they only now articulated clearly. For women petitioners, in par- ticular, the embrace of Jewish tradition divorced from the power of Jewish men produced a more radical sense of detachment from male Jewish authority, both rab- binic and enlightened, and provided a new set of ideological tools with which to express their increasingly personal commitment to Judaism. 307</page><page sequence="8">Olga Litvak For Freeze, the divorce, custody, and settlement petitions of Jewish women to state agencies and to provincial Russian courts serve as a grammar of Jewish experience under the tsars. They not only shed light on the lives of Jewish hus- bands, wives, parents, and children but also offer a key to the terms that defined Jewish identity both inside and outside of the Pale. Like Nathans, Freeze maintains that it is impossible to understand the emergence of this vocabulary without un- derstanding the role of the state in its formation; at the same time, she finds evi- dence of the Russian-Jewish encounter in the world of halakhic observance and behind the closed doors of the Jewish kitchen and the Jewish bedroom, places where it has been least visible. Indeed, in Freeze's eminently capable hands, the history of the modern Jewish family serves as a window into the private life of the Russian state. As Freeze's engaging narrative draws to a close, the fate of the for- mer and the latter seem inextricably intertwined. Attempting to explain the fluctu- ations in the Jewish divorce rate, Freeze uncovers a signal link between the increasing prominence of Jewish traditionalism and the growing conservatism of the Russian administration, evidence of a disastrous alliance that would eventual- ly discredit the reforming Romanovs among its progressive supporters. Freeze's conclusion demonstrates the subtlety of her approach to the com- plicated relationship between tradition and modernity; she points out that the marked decline of divorce rates among Jews in the last decade of tsarist rule was not a throwback to an earlier, stable model of family life but an effect of distinct- ly contemporary ideological, social, and economic pressures. This analytical so- phistication does not, unfortunately, extend to her initial premise (rather than argument) regarding the existence of a traditional Jewish family, supposedly trans- formed in the course of state intervention in the era of the Great Reforms. Her unre- flective use of published material-memoirs in particular but also prescriptive legal sources and literary texts-contrasts with her critical approach to archival sources. Freeze relies upon the former to construct a stable model of traditional Jewish family against which change, as evidenced in archival documents, can be plotted. But what is the basis for concluding that there was ever anything like a stable, traditional Jewish family when the published sources are, in fact, contem- porary with the archival material that Freeze employs to make the opposite point? One might argue that patriarchal authority is always already vulnerable to the threat of individual desire. One might even go so far as to say that the struggle over the modern Jewish family presents an especially striking instance of the age- old Jewish practice of mobilizing external power as a mechanism of coercion, a source of support for internal authority. The factor that distinguishes nineteenth- century Russia from, say, thirteenth-century Castile was the self-appointed mis- sion of the reforming state, to which an individual might appeal in order to thwart the alliance between conservatives on both sides of the Russian-Jewish divide. The resulting realignment in social power produced an increasingly shrill public rhetoric, reflected in literary, autobiographical, and rabbinic pronouncements against recalcitrant Jewish youth and rebellious Jewish women; this discourse re- lied on the pointed contrast between past stability and an ever-present sense of "cri- sis." Thus, the rabbinic and the reformed intelligentsia alike construed any form of resistance to adult male authority as dangerously new, a symptom of generational 308</page><page sequence="9">New Trends in the Study of Russian Jewry decline from the days when children obeyed their parents and wives obeyed their husbands. In fact, Balin's study of five Jewish women writers shows that the nos- talgic view of the obedient wife and daughter was hardly consistent with the ex- perience of women who appropriated aspects of the same tradition to transform their lives and to claim a place within modern Jewish culture. Balin's women move through the Pale as resident strangers and contest it from within not as a juridical fact or as a set of political and social boundaries but as a deeply rooted cultural paradigm that defined and delimited Russian-Jewish selfhood. Balin sees the pale in terms of entrenched gender conventions; for her, writ- ing out of the Pale involves the revision of stereotypes embedded in popular im- ages of Russian-Jewish women as faithful keepers of tradition, on the one hand, and as lady radicals, on the other. Instead, Balin attempts to integrate women into the story of the creation of modern Jewish culture, particularly into the world of Hebrew and Russian languages, the literary command of which serves not only the enlightenment of Jews but of Judaism. Balin argues that Russian-Jewish women were the producers, and not merely the consumers, of modern Jewish culture. In the very act of writing they transcended the gender divide that recreated the pale in the minds of male intellectuals who had left its confines in pursuit of European culture. Balin's subjects mirror the socioeconomic profile of their male coun- terparts-like the men who engaged in the project of enlightenment, they were predominantly of urban, middle-class background, upwardly mobile and multi-lin- gual-however, these women approached their writing as a personal quest and not as a social project. Thus, Balin's study moves uneasily between a group portrait and five eccentric paths towards the aesthetic realization of feminine selfhood. Un- like male enlighteners, enlightened women (the distinction between noun and ad- jective is critical) operated outside of the conventions that defined the Haskalah as a radical literary movement and (after Zalkin) a social trend that emerged out of the study house. They were, to paraphrase the words of the literary scholar Dan Miron, loners who never came together. The distinctly feminine embrace of art led to the common rejection of em- bourgeoisement, the socially conservative aim of Jewish enlightenment. Although Balin's women shared little in terms of literary aspirations, they all rejected the bourgeois standard of docile Jewish domesticity that reduced female ambitions to the sphere of marriage and motherhood. For scholars of Jewish modernity, this is a critical point, first, because it evinces the cultural implications of the Haskalah's social conservatism, which was at odds with its rhetorical commitment to person- al liberation from communal discipline and political disability. Second, Balin's women demonstrate that it was possible to be enlightened without Enlightenment. Whereas women's experience as readers anticipated many aspects of the self-con- scious turn toward the modern in Jewish society-see, for instance, the recent book by Iris Parush, Reading Women: The Benefit of Marginality in Nineteenth- Century Eastern European Jewish Society (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2001)-their work as writers remained profoundly at odds with the social ethos of the Jewish En- lightenment. Jewish women writers found their intellectual passions and personal autonomy severely compromised by the persistence of the pale in the gender hier- archy affirmed by the male proponents of the Haskalah. In their public lives, they 309</page><page sequence="10">Olga Litvak performed the tension between the idea of an autonomous, articulate Jewish per- sonhood and the romantic construction of bourgeois femininity; a tension that an- imated the nineteenth-century distinction between private and public, between mind and heart, between reason and nature, between masculinity and femininity. The self-consciously private languages of longing cultivated by the five authors in Balin's study formed the basis for a posture of resistance to this logic of gendered freedom, embodied most famously in J. L. Gordon's exhortation to the maskil to "be a man in the street and a Jew at home." Balin's study highlights the difficulties of extricating oneself from the hold of the pale even when one's avowed purpose is to do just that; her women defy every possible assumption that informs the current version of Russian-Jewish history, but in her re-telling, their emergence into the light of historical account- ability does not serve the correction of the standard narrative She plots their ex- perience along the conventional trajectory of Russian-Jewish historiography, from the Pale into the world beyond, as if it were possible to revise one aspect of the story without considering its implications for the whole. Balin's subjects are far more revolutionary than she is; they appropriated and defied male versions of themselves, while she explains and thereby implicitly dismisses their work by ref- erence to psychological inadequacy: a failure to cope with the conflict between personal desire and social expectation which made up for a lack of talent then and excuses a lack of historical interest now. The most profound limitations of the pale do not stem from an absence of evidence; historians are drawn to its pieties even when their own sources point to radical acts of transgression. This is most obviously true of Balin; her analysis de- rives from the premise-entirely in concert with the gendered norm that she explicitly rejects-that whereas intellectual women are idiosyncratic, the desire for motherhood and family are a natural attribute of femininity. But the pale per- sists even in the other three studies, far more consistent in their attempt to move Russian-Jewish history beyond the boundaries of cliche, particularly in the way Zalkin, Nathans, and Freeze all take for granted the documentary import of the de- pictions of Jewish life in literary sources, not only in fiction but also in letters and autobiographies. Such sources engage with reality in a far more complicated way than their slight ethnographic value would suggest. Yet, traces of the Pale surface in the form of facile faulty literary readings, even in the methodologically sophis- ticated and rigorously empirical approaches to the investigation of Jewish moder- nity undertaken by Freeze and Nathans. Zalkin's work exemplifies the other extreme; overstating the gap between maskilic literature and the history of the Haskalah, he simply dismisses the former as a foil for his sociological model of the latter. Not one of the authors takes up the epistemological implications of the tension between text and context, or sees fit to ask why previous generations of historians might have been so invested in a history of Russian Jewry bound by the conceptual straitjacket of the pale and why our own generation continues to reify the fictional commonplaces of Russian-Jewish history even as scholarship strives to undermine their hold with the application of hard data drawn from the archives. Sensitive to the stultifying effects of Jewish memory on their particular historical projects, Zalkin, Nathans, Balin, and Freeze boldly stake out new claims 310</page><page sequence="11">New Trends in the Study of Russian Jewry for the field. Now that they have done so, the study of the Russian-Jewish imag- ination will surely be subject to the same critical standard that informs their own exploration of the uncharted territory beyond the pale.
