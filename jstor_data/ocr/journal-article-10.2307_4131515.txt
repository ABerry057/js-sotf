<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJSReview 28:1 (2004), 173-188 JEW, ZIONIST, HEBREW, OR ISRAELI? Transformations in the Identity of Jacob in the Novels of Benjamin Tammuz and Meir Shalev by Chaya Shacham The life story of Jacob, one of the longest and most complex of the Bible narratives, is a mine for the imagination of modern writers. Hebrew writers of po- etry and prose have been drawn to Jacob's biblical tale and have made it the overt or latent intertext in their work. A probable reason for this attraction is that Jacob himself is portrayed as a character of multiple contradictions: He has inner strength and can survive extreme trials, yet he shows human frailties and even moral flaws. He can serve as a mod- el with the qualities of a modern hero, and this is how he appears in some con- temporary Hebrew writing. Jacob is perceived as the founder of the Israelite progeny (begetter of the twelve tribes) and as the initiator of ancient Israel's move to self-definition, thus, he becomes a fascinating object for modern Hebrew writers contending with ques- tions of identity. They appropriate his image for a discussion of thorny issues of Israeliness, Hebrew-ness, Judaism, and Zionism. Here, I have focused on Jacob's character as it takes shape in two Israeli nov- els separated by two decades: Jacob, by Benjamin Tammuz (1971), and Esau, by Meir Shalev (1991).' I attempt to trace the transformations and roles of the bibli- cal character Jacob within these novels. In each, the character of Jacob is a peg on which to hang a fictional tale for literary purposes, but also (and perhaps chiefly) a means of clarifying essential questions. These questions concern identity, and generate the cultural, political, and ideological tensions that repeatedly appear on the public agenda in Israel. The two decades separating the publication of these works are significant from a cultural and ideological Israeli point of view. The issues that troubled Is- raeli writers at the beginning of the 1970s are quite different from those in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the perception of Jacob in these two books differs ac- cordingly. In Tammuz's novel, the character Jacob is still embedded in the ideo- logical world of Israel of the 1950, then shaped by weighty cultural conflicts dating back to the pre-state era.Shalev's Jacob belongs to the generation born and raised 1.

Naturally, therefore, each of the writers focuses on particular qualities of the biblical Jacob, which differ in accordance with the different purposes of each nov- el. Tammuz depicts Jacob as a restless character, wandering through regions, coun- tries, and even continents, as Jacob of old was in his adulthood; by contrast, Shalev's Jacob is the kind of person that the Bible describes as a righteous tent- dweller. In fact, he left home just once, when he ran away to his mother's family in the Galilee and stayed with them for a while. Tammuz mainly takes Jacob's strength and readiness for struggle as his most prominent characteristics, while Shalev sees in him mostly the laborer and the lover. Tammuz dwells on Jacob's life story and character in order to make an overt ideological statement, whereas Shalev cleverly insinuates a political stand. The biblical Jacob's enthralling narrative thus lends itself in very different ways to both novels, which absorb and apply its ma- terials in altogether different forms. The central biblical text underlying Benjamin Tammuz's book is Genesis 32, more precisely its last part and particularly vv. 25-29, which narrate Jacob's wrestling with the angel of God at Jabbok ford. The scene ends with Jacob's ad- versary naming him anew: "And he said, 'Your name shall no more be called Ja- cob but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed'" (Gen. 32:29). The change of Jacob's name opens a new era, in which he and his descendants are given special status; the name "Israel" becomes a binding and a foundational epithet. This scripture is introduced relatively late in Tammuz's Jacob, only after his eponymous hero is shown to evince similar characteristics to his ancient namesake. Yet, intimations of the foundational tale are scattered throughout the earlier parts of the book, and these create the grounds for its actual appearance, as we shall see later. Jacob centers on the character of Jacob Engelson-Malachi, whose biogra- phy, in its phases, deeds, and formative experiences, matches the history of the generation struggling for the establishment of the state of Israel. Jacob, who was born in the Diaspora and who immigrated to Palestine in his childhood, begins the journey as a member of the pre-state underground. Later he leaves it, joins the Palmah, is caught by the British, and is sent to prison camps at Latrun and then Er- itrea. He escapes, wanders around the world, and returns to Palestine to fight in Is- rael's War of Independence. After the war he tries to fit into the civilian life of the young state; he fights in the Sinai Campaign and then travels to Europe, where he spends some time in Paris before returning to Israel. The course of this linear bi- ography (abstracted here from the winding narration in the novel, which divides the telling among several narrators in different styles and varied techniques),2 is 2. According to one critic, the various narrations in this novel result from the hero's inner spir- itual state (Daniel Gedanke, Haaretz, 5.11.1971). He goes on to say that this formation increases the text's demands of the reader, since each literary form [in this novel] emphasizes a different angle in the 174</page><page sequence="3">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? accompanied by an analogous series of major themes from the Jacob stories in the Bible. As well, concomitant with the biography of Jacob of the novel is a discus- sion of ideological aspects arising at decisive junctures along his own life history, usually in a conversation or an argument with someone else. The ideological dis- cussion essentially exposes the conflict between Jacob's belief in the "Canaanite" doctrine in his youth and his disillusionment with it at a later stage-a radical change in his perceptions. But other matters, also contingent on this conflict, re- quire further clarification. As noted, the wrestling match with the angel is a central detail on which Tam- muz bases the analogy between his hero and his ancient counterpart, but it is not the only detail from the Bible story woven into the novel. All through the life his- tory of Jacob Engelson-Malachi, Tammuz scatters many more allusions meant to substantiate the analogy between him and his prototype. For example, an impor- tant place in the book is occupied by descriptions of dreams and discourse about dreams, especially those concerning what the hero terms "that place" (pp. 114, 141, 167) (with mention of Jacob's dream in Genesis 28:10: "Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep"); Jacob Engelson's possessions increase without any effort on his part, like the pos- sessions of the biblical Jacob (p. 111); and again, like him, Jacob Engelson is per- ceived as cunning by those around him (p. 104). He associates with characters called Big Israel and Little Israel, whose names echo the earned name of biblical Jacob, and he also, like Jacob of old, is caught between Leah and Rachel. Leah is his boyhood sweetheart, from whom he parts despite her love and devotion to him, while his Rachel is no other than his beloved and sickly wife, whose real name, Shulamit, he deliberately changes to Rachel so as to match the biblical account (102), thus creating an analogy between himself and Jacob of old. Like the bibli- cal Rachel, Tammuz's Rachel dies young, but unlike her, the novel's Rachel has borne no child. In Jacob's fantasies about a son that he perhaps begot (by a woman nicknamed in the novel "the Little Singer"), he sees Shulamit-Rachel adopting the child, to whom in the fullness of time he will disclose, "Your mother died giving birth to you"; thus in his imaginings he turns him into Benjamin, Jacob's youngest son, whose birth was hard for Rachel, who died in her labor. All these analogical details depict the character of Jacob Engelson as a repli- ca of ancient Jacob, but still the two emerge as separate entities. Yet, the chapter titled "My Pedigree" is exceptional. In this chapter, which is Jacob's life history as told by himself, authentic matter from the Bible story serves not for analogy to the modern tale but as actual biographical data of Jacob the speaker, to the point of complete merging of the two entities. This kind of analogy with biblical matter is not the only one in the novel. Tammuz takes various structures and motifs from the biblical account, which he creatively blends into the flow of the modern protagonist's story. For example, Ja- character's development. Regarding this technique of multiplicity of narrators and mixture of styles used in this work, another critic comments that while Tammuz was not the first to apply these means, in combining them for such a functional purpose he anticipates the narrators in Israeli fiction of the 1980s and after (YosefOren, Identities in Israeli Literature. Yahad, 1994, p. 36). 175</page><page sequence="4">Chaya Shacham cob describes himself as a kid who was made an outsider by his classmates be- cause he believed in violence and in school "lived by the sword" (p. 30). This state- ment actually approximates him to the biblical Esau, to whom his father, Isaac, says in his blessing: "By your sword you shall live" (Genesis 27:40). When mod- em Jacob adopts the ideology of the Canaanite movement, in becoming Esau-like he also realizes the rest of Isaac's words: "And you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck" (ibid.). This Esau- like modem character of Jacob indeed tries to shake off his "brother's yoke," mean- ing his Jewish identity. In his first appearance in the novel, Jacob possesses a galut (Diaspora)-Jew identity, which he tries to get rid of: "Jacob was not born here," the subversive opening of the novel declares.3 Later on, the clandestine band for which Jacob operates, ambitious in its "Canaanite-ism," is also exposed, from the author's satiric viewpoint: "None of the people of the underground was born here; but they all believed that they had cast off the legacy of their Jewish origins and they were Hebrews in all things. And whenever one of them fails-a typical failure that only galut Jews could pull of-this was proof of the self-evident truth: an immigrant is never to be trusted. Respect him and suspect him, that's the rule. And everyone, in his own eyes, was an exception to this rule" (p. 13). While the "Esau-ness" in the novel's Jacob symbolizes the break from the Diaspora heritage, for which he yearns in his new "Canaanite" transformation, the ancient Jacob is an apt prototype for Hebrewness, the heart's desire of the "Canaan- ites": Not only is he a native of the place, in his wanderings throughout the Fertile Crescent he also realizes the longing for integration into the region. The "Canaanites," or Young Hebrews, a political and ideological movement formed in 1944, aimed to establish a Hebrew nation uniting all ethnic groups with- in the natural borders of Eretz-Israel by renewing the ties with the ancient Mediter- ranean civilizations. Since Judaism was a religion without a territory, they held that Eretz-Israeli Jewry should sever all connections with the Jews in the Diaspora, and instead establish connections with neighboring peoples. The "Canaanites" were a minor group, although at a certain period in the 1940's and 1950's they had quite an impact on Israeli culture. The modem Jacob assumes his Hebrew-ness eagerly and without hesitation, but his friend Arik, who is in fact his alter ego, murmurs sedition right at the start of their membership of the Young Hebrews movement. Arik seems to hold with the movement's basic principles: that the Jews are not a people but a religious sect dis- persed all over the world, and that what is taking shape in the Land of Israel is, by contrast, the start of a real nation, a new-old nation (p. 35). But reflecting on what the Hebrew populace will look like without a religion and with the Hebrew lan- guage forced on it, Arik concludes that it will be a Levantine people (p. 36), and not in the positive sense. 3. Y. Oren (ibid. p. 38) suggests that this ironic opening is a parody on the famous opening of the book By His Own Hands (BE'MO YADAV) by Moshe Shamir (1951), in which the narrator declares that his hero Elik was "born from the sea." This phrase has become a fixture in Israeli culture, signi- fying nativeness. A parody on it should therefore be regarded as an immediate reference to problems of identity in this novel. 176</page><page sequence="5">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? Soon, cracks appear in the wall of Jacob's own Canaanite faith, and he at- tempts across time to engage his dead grandfather in dialogue. He even resolves to abandon the underground movement, so as to demolish the last barrier between himself and his Jewish grandfather, and to eliminate the rigid dichotomy underly- ing the Canaanite outlook. In his words, "No longer galut Jews on the one hand- stooped, wretched, bewildered; and on the other hand a proud and fearless Hebrew, Englishman-killer, reciting the heroic deeds of Israel" (p. 94). This is the stage where Jacob becomes aware that true heroism is not the physical courage of the Hebrew in his land but the spiritual courage of the Jew, and precisely in his domi- cile in the Diaspora: "And when you first picked up a book of Spinoza, your brav- ery was more awful and beautiful than anything I am ever likely to accomplish on the soil of this land." So says Jacob to his grandfather Abraham in his imaginary dialogue. "Here great heroism isn't necessary...This is home.. .Only outside, in alien deserts of church spires and forests of wolves does a man need true courage" (p. 94). Jacob's abandonment of Canaanism, which aims at creating a new Hebrew man by detaching from Judaism and incorporating regional cultures, and his in- tention to return to his Jewish roots take him from Palestine to exile in Europe and a stay in Paris. There, detachment and distance offer him the possibility of intro- spection, from which he derives interesting insights into issues of his identity. In the eyes of his European interlocutors-Jews and non-Jews alike-Jacob emerges as the prototype of the Israeli man, who sparks expectations originating in the binary thinking prevalent in Europe about Israelis as distinct from Jews. (As one of the secondary characters, Skinny Nick, says about Jacob, "But Jack isn't a Jew, he's an Israeli, and we know the difference very well" [p. 187].) As an Israeli he is expected, as enunciated by another of the novel's personages (the Franco-Jew- ish baron) to be "Something new, simple; steady...Not complicated at all," for, "We've got enough complications of our own" (p.). But Jacob knows that he can- not meet these expectations. Despite the physical wars and victories, which are turning the Israeli man into a new human species, in the eye of the beholder, he and his alter ego, Arik, believe that precisely now internal conflicts within the Is- raeli soul are imminent, conflicts which are not specified in the novel and whose outcomes are not preordained (p. 154). These internal conflicts, to Arik's mind, won't necessarily end with the longed-for victory that the baron awaits, and there- fore cancel out the apparent drastic difference between Israeli and Jew. Statehood in the physical homeland, which is an obvious product of Zion- ism metamorphosing into Israeliness, is in Jacob's opinion only a brief interlude in the life of the Jewish people for the purpose of "refueling," after they sensed the danger of physical disintegration in exile and their instinct for survival was roused. For, as he says, "Judaism is in fact exile. Even voluntary exile" (p. 155). This is a form of existence that the entire people chose at the beginning of their history. Only in exile did the people perfect the values of the spirit, which imparted to them their special nature. Therefore, the hopes that the Diaspora Jews hang on "the change of the national face of new Israeli man" (p. 156) are unfounded. In Paris, when Jacob wants "to explain the spiritual world of the new Israeli, the spiritual setting from which and upon which he acts and reacts," he does so on 177</page><page sequence="6">Chaya Shacham the basis of his personal experience, which coincides with modem Israeli history (p. 179). He then plots for his interviewer the course of the confrontations with the Arabs in Palestine. He begins in 1929, continues through the disturbances of 1936, and then goes on to the war in 1948; this war, he asserts, was what in fact opened a way to genuine acquaintance with the land and with the Arab neighbors. "This was the first time that we clashed with the Arabs face to face, body to body, shoul- der to shoulder. On the surface, there was conflict here; maybe danger; but in the end there was a magic touch ... from the day we fought and defeated the Arabs we began to love them in a new, different way, paradoxical-absurd almost. The victory contained the buds of schizophrenia, to use psychologists' jargon." He winds up his survey by revealing his feelings of guilt about the conquest of the land: "It was theirs and I took it. Whatever the reasons and the circumstance-his- toric, emotional, legal" (p. 181). Jacob generates and develops these intuitions pre- cisely from the perspective of his remote living in exile, where he experiences his Jewishness anew but is beset by doubts and uncertainties as to the Zionist solution. Still, these sentiments about contact with the Arabs can only be understood as iron- ic and retrospective, uttered by one looking back at the beliefs and tendencies of the Canaanite movement from the outside and with a critical eye. In a lecture by Tammuz in 1972 in London,4 where he was serving as Israel's cultural attache, he touched on the issue of guilt, and pinpointed it as the ubiqui- tous feature of Hebrew literature written prior to the creation of the Canaanite movement. This feeling, he said, derives from a complex of things: carrying the shame of the persecutions in the Diaspora; conceding Jewish identity for various historic reasons; returning to the land of the fathers and displacing the Muslim falah working his soil. He ascribed the arousal and prevalence of this guilt to the failure of Zionism as a secular movement to provide an unequivocal answer to the question of the Jewish right to resettle in the land of Israel as well as to the ques- tion of its attitude to the Muslim population that inhabited parts of the country, and he addressed the need of literature to address the inner conflicts arising from these matters: It would have been a simple matter, in answer to the first question, to point to Genesis, chapter 32 as our infallible mandate had we not ceased to uphold the precepts of the Jewish religion. It would have been possible to answer the sec- ond question had we been accepted on amicable terms by the Muslim popu- lation.5 Tammuz's graphic description of the struggle with the Arabs, noted earlier, is but one link in a long chain of accounts of contests and mentions of Jacob's con- flicts dispersed throughout the novel. Conflict is the basic experience that defines 4. The lecture was published later in English under the title "Second Encounter with the Angel" as a preface to the collection Meetings with the Angel: Seven Stories from Israel (edited by Benjamin Tammuz and Leon Yudkin) Andre Deutsch, 1973. In Hebrew it was published as an appendix to the book by Menuha Gilboa, Golden Dreams and Their Shattering: Literature and Ideology in the Work of Benjamin Tammuz. Hakibbutz Hameuhad, 1995, pp. 11-116. 5. 1973:15. 178</page><page sequence="7">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? the life of the protagonist, like his ancient forefather who wrestles with the angel and prevails, as described in Genesis 32. Jacob's urge to struggle is at first unconscious (as when he pounced on an elderly Arab who hurt a young woman); next it stems from necessity (in the fight with the Egyptian sergeant in the war). Still later, an element of mystical quest in- vests his conflicts, when he feels, while fighting, that he is entering into deep and mysterious contact with his national past (p. 105, 106). The ancient Jacob's fight with and victory over the angel are perceived by the hero of the novel as a foundational act from which all the other links follow. According to his view, since then, "Like it or not, we roam the world as some kind of crazy Inspector-Generals, supervisors of kosher observance, minute-takers of wrongdoings, a sort of professional righteous ones ... persecuted-because they persecute; beaten-because they threaten; hated-because they give no peace ...; in a word, Jews" (p. 227). The modem Jacob, who has sloughed off the fake and artificial identity of the new Hebrew, therefore scrutinizes the Jewish identity that he has inherited from his forebears and to which he returns with a critical eye.6 Not only does he not come to terms with it; quite the contrary, he is ready at any moment to annul the old covenant of the divine choice, which arose from Jacob's triumph over the an- gel. He is ready for another wrestling match with the angel, this time to lose it and thereby lose the special quality of "Thou has chosen us," which, he believes, is the root of the evil of Jewish destiny.7 Benjamin Tammuz's hero thus strives for a change of identity. It is not to be through the extreme and decisive revolution of the Canaanite doctrine, which de- taches itself absolutely from historical Judaism. It is to be through an attempt to change Jewish existence from anomalous to normal, or, in his words: "No longer shall I go about the world chosen and unique; but one among many, taking my part humbly and with joy" (p. 247). The story of Jacob's struggle with the angel in Genesis 32 also furnishes the surname of the protagonist of Jacob, "Engelson-Malachi," which means "Angel's son-my angel". The name signifies that the double angel is in fact an insepara- ble part of Jacob's entity, and therefore his struggle is an internal one between dif- ferent parts of his personality. True, Jacob himself defines his struggle as seeking 6. Nissim Calderon ("An Angel at a Reasonable Price," Achshav, No. 25-28, 1973, pp. 278- 288) sharply criticizes Tammuz's historical perception in this novel. He calls the writer "a historical speculator who contemns history" and accuses him of not being able to treat the Jewish person and all his metamorphoses with respect (ibid., p. 278). 7. In his lecture (n. 4) Tammuz spoke of the three meetings between the Jewish person and his own identity. The first, told in Genesis 32, is Jacob's wrestling with the angel; the second extends over four millennia of Jewish history and is composed of two elements: intimacy between the Jewish per- son and his God and the divine rightness of the Jew in light of the wounds he suffers again and again. The third encounter has not yet occurred. The fate of the Israelis is contingent upon it. Its goal is an- other bout of wrestling with an angel, this time the Jew emerging defeated and conceding the status of chosen people; and the nature of the contest will not be theological. This perception also pervades the novel and forges the path of the hero, Jacob, who is not grasped in this context as an individual case but as the epitome of the Jewish/Israeli entity, seeking its identity among the various possibilities. 179</page><page sequence="8">Chaya Shacham to put an end to the split existence of his personality, either by suppression of one of the parts or by its unification to the point of complete identity: "Did I actually wrestle with an angel, when in truth I wrestled with my brother?" Jacob asks. "Or if you like, I wrestled with my brother-within-me, with myself' (p. 116). Only through this decisive inner struggle, Tammuz believes, will the new identity of Ja- cob-Israel grow on the soil of the Land of Israel. III While Tammuz's novel focuses mainly on the episode of Jacob's wrestling with the angel, the biblical prototype underlying the novel Esau, by Meir Shalev, is the story of the twin brothers Jacob and Esau and their relationship. The biblical story emphasizes their contrasting characters, portraying them as two different human pro- totypes: "When the boys grew up, Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was quiet man, dwelling in tents" (Gen. 25:27). This binary opposition serves as a frame in Shalev's story, although its causes, course, nature, and outcome are quite different from the biblical ones and are subject to the twists and turns of the novel. Shalev creates out of the fundamentals of the biblical story his own literary form in this work. Just as the biblical story has a break between the brothers in time and place (after Jacob's flight from Esau) so does Shalev's story. The novelist uses the distance in time and place as a narrative device that enables his Esau, the broth- er who relates Jacob's life story, a retrospective and an introspective look. The principle for choosing subject matter from the Jacob stories in Esau is similar to that in Tammuz's novel, but the proportions, emphases, and modes of de- sign and elaboration are entirely different.8 Shalev and Tammuz both employ a multi-perspective technique, but where- as Tammuz relies on different narrators, identified by name, Shalev develops his main plot, weaving into it analogous stories that are cryptic and tend toward fan- tastic hyperbole. The fictional storyteller is not identified expressly in the work, although quite obviously it is the novel's narrator, Esau. Because Jacob's story is told in the novel from the viewpoint of his twin brother, whose name is the title of the book, the narrator's life story is in any case encompassed by and connected with that of the hero in various ways. This is sig- nificant, as we shall see. Shalev uses the biblical materials as allusions, but without being fully com- mitted to their original meaning. At times-in fact quite often-he even parodies it. For example, he condenses the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, merging the characters of Isaac and Rebecca with those of Abraham and Sarah, and making the latter the parents of the novel's twins, Jacob and Esau. He omits Rachel from Ja- cob's life history,9 giving him instead Leah, who appears here as the ultimate love; 8. Using old materials in an intertextual way is not limited in Esau to biblical matter. Shalev employs a spectacular selection of allusions to many literary works by authors such as Dickens, Field- ing, Melville, Nabukov, Lofting, and many more, as well as to Greek myths. While Shalev adheres fair- ly faithfully to these sources, he allows himself much freedom with the biblical account. 9. Rachel is mentioned in Esau only indirectly, as the heroine of a poem that Abraham, Jacob's father, learned in the Turkish army from the recruits of the Herzliya Gymnasia. 180</page><page sequence="9">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? it is she who bears him Benjamin, who is here his firstborn (not the youngest of his sons, as in the case of the biblical patriarch). The image of the twin Jacob clutching the heel of his brother at their birth is given metaphoric usage in the nov- el:'0 "And right after that, as if taking hold of the heel of the first memory, was born the knowledge that I had seen the picture of Whitman back in my childhood" (p. 71); "Catastrophes are wont to be born taking happiness by the heel." A varia- tion on the angel's words to Jacob is said here of Abraham, the father of Jacob and Esau in the novel: "But father himself didn't fight, didn't struggle, didn't over- come" (p. 100). Jacob's daughter is born "all covered with a thin down of red hair" (p. 295). Abramson, the benefactor and employer of Esau in America, asks him to "Make me a savory meat such as I love" (p. 282). Referring to the baking of bread, and to Esau going out into the New York street he says, "Go out to the field and hunt me some venison" (p. 298). In this novel, the person who is lame in the hip is not Ja- cob but his cousin Shimon; and the sentence "Let me go, for the day breaketh" (p. 266), originally uttered by the being that struggled with biblical Jacob, is said here to the narrator by no other than "this moment.... It wants me to write so it can pass" (ibid.). Yet, this quasi-parodic principle does not eliminate the impor- tance of the ancient narrative model that underpins the novel and is an essential starting point for understanding the variant before us. In the novel, Jacob and his twin are the sons of a Jewish father of Sephardi descent; a member of the old Jewish settlement in Palestine and a native of Jerusalem. Their mother is from a family of Russian Pravoslav converts living in a village in Galilee;" from time to time, when angry, she mentions that Tatar blood flows in her veins. Shalev thus "translates" the old union of Jacob-descendant of Abraham, the father of the Hebrew nation-with the daughter of Laban the Aramean, who is not of Hebrew stock, into a union between a Jew and one whose family origins are not Jewish. The rationale behind this odd coupling becomes clear on the notional level of the work. In this framework, Jacob and his brother are to be perceived as the fruit of a union between ancient, splendid Judaism, which is very much in decline, and the earthy and robust "goy" element, which is joined directly to the soil. Jacob and his brother are therefore a new Jewish-human vari- ety, perhaps actually a Land-of-Israel species, intended both to be produced by these contradictions and to resolve them. Their life story is marked by the decisive act of their mother, Sarah, who moves her family away from Jerusalem. In an unforgettable scene she ties herself 10.

Galilee is indeed the place of settlement of converts who migrated from Russia to Palestine at the end of the nineteenth century, as related in the story. But in the context of the pioneering move- ment in the Land of Israel, it is known chiefly as a mythological place of settlement and "true" attach- ment to the soil. Of Galilee, Y. H. Brenner says the following in his tale From Here and There (1911), which conducts a piercing soul-searching of the Second Aliya: "From there wonders are told. There it is a new land and new sky. There true Hebrew farmers are .... There model Hebrew workers are. ... Wonders, wonders are told. Can one believe them?" (Yosef Haim Brenner, From Here andfrom There. In The Complete Works ofY. H.

There, in a village, the members of her fam- ily, who arrive from Galilee, establish by their toil a bakery for Jacob in which he will make his living. The flight from Jerusalem to the village is to be understood in the novel as a statement of distinct ideological significance. So is bread-baking, which is placed in the center of it. Jerusalem is depicted here by various descriptions and statements as a spiteful, threatening city, inspiring melancholy, suffused with reli- gious piety, and driving its citizens and visitors out of their mind. The escape from it is described as emergence into the open space, at once involving an immediate contact with nature. The flight from Jerusalem takes place on the very day of the great earthquake of 1927. The coincidence of the two events is meant to intimate by analogy and metaphor the impact of the severance of contact with Jerusalem as a decisive and foundational event in the history of this exemplary family. A new era begins immediately afterwards. The solution imposed on Abraham by Sarah is, in a nutshell, the solution proposed by the Zionist revolution to the problem of Jewish Diaspora life: aban- donment of the galut (embodied here in the old Jerusalem settlement-ha'yeshuv ha'yashan-with its unproductive, detached-from-nature way of life) and its re- placement by a creative life experience, embodied as the new settlement in the vil- lage.'2 This important event is the point from which the novel's plot develops, focusing on the life of the next generation, especially Jacob and his family, whom the novel portrays as both the guinea pigs and the litmus paper of the Zionist en- terprise. Right from the start, the tale draws the reader into imaginary and quasi-myth- ic domains, whose affinity with the Bible story is not at once apparent. Yet, the ba- sic, well-known biblical structure is there from the moment the plot begins to unfold. Thus, the sons of the woman tied to the carriage are described unmistak- ably as: "one a redhead built like his mother, one delicate and dark ... and despite the differences in their appearance, you could tell they were twins" (p. 20). The novel's references to the underlying biblical account may be likened to a game of hide-and-seek. For example, the non-identical twins are depicted as hav- ing been short-sighted since childhood, and having to share the same pair of glasses through which they observed the world. The symbolism of this detail, which cre- ates a seeming closeness between the ways the two look at the world, departs a lit- tle from the scripture, while the difference between them, evident already from the early stages, rests in principle on the biblical model. Yet, Shalev turns the familiar biblical structure on its head in the conceptual statement inherent in the novel: here, it is Jacob who shows interest in the practical side of life, while Esau finds escape 12. For example, the contrast between one experience and another is brought home in the fol- lowing words of the narrator: "In the new place, no one practiced blowing the shofar and no beadle woke us for penitential prayers before the High Holy Days. Instead, shrieking swallows and flocks of butterflies... fluttered to us to announce that autumn was coming. Then Mother took us to the fields. ... Her shoulders and breasts rose and fell as she inhaled the smell of the plowed earth with pleasure" (pp. 88-89). In its condensed and pinpointed form, the contrast is stated thus: "and the holy carriage [the Patriarch's] became a bread cart" (p. 90). 182</page><page sequence="11">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? in books.13 The metamorphosis that the brothers undergo expresses the reversal of the dichotomous structure. Jacob, forced into exile with his mother's family be- cause of a quarrel with his father (not with his brother, thus repeating the pattern of simultaneous reliance upon and detachment from the biblical text in almost the same breath), returns from Galilee "like one of the peasants we always wanted to resemble" (p. 259). The redheaded, hairy, burly brother, who describes himself as easygoing and well-mannered, and as one who at an early stage has already "with- drawn into my own blurry worlds" (p. 137), remains in his parents' house to im- merse himself in books supplied to him by his friend, the village librarian. When they are twenty-one, the brothers' paths part, physically and geographically. Esau exiles himself from his home and his country to America, where he becomes a his- torian of food who writes about bread. Jacob remains in his place, establishes a family with Leah, the sweetheart of his youth, inherits his father's bakery, loses his beloved firstborn son in an army accident, and retains his grip on life through the birth of another child. Clearly then, Meir Shalev intentionally intermixes the biographical data of the various biblical protagonists to fashion the heroes of his novel.'4 This, like the overturning of the biblical structures, may be seen as a narrative device to serve the conceptual level in the novel. By such means the two biographies of the twins are implied to be, in fact, one, which at some stage was divided into two. Or, al- ternatively, at the very beginning there is a kernel of polar difference in the twins' united experience: "We are so different from one another, and so close and con- nected," the narrator says (p. 156). Thus, conceptually the author exploits the resemblance on the one hand and the difference between the brothers on the other to create a binary polarization be- tween the "Jacob-like" and the "Esau-like" identities in the novel. They are per- ceived as two identities struggling within a single entity, namely the current Israeli entity. In Esau, Jacob is defined metonymically through his hands as a man of con- crete action; the expression "Jacob's hands" (p. 242) replaces the biblical phrase "the hands of Esau," but at the same time echoes it. Jacob is attached to his place: Since inheriting the bakery he has never left it, and he refuses to sell it for an enor- mous sum to be demolished even though it is now surrounded by a neighborhood 13. One of the critics (Kobi Freund, "On Doughs and Bakers" [Al isot ve'nachtomim], Moz- nayim, vol. 67, No. 1. 1992, pp. 36-38) associates this dichotomy with a distinctive trend in Israeli lit- erature concerning the status of intellectuals. In works of literature (e.g., by A. B. Yehoshua or Amos Oz) the tendency is to place at the positive pole a practical, well-rooted, laconic, naive person, and at the opposite pole the type that is supposed to be reflective, not engaged in physical labor, cosmopoli- tan, and rootless (ibid., p. 36). But this insight does not explain the change of places between Jacob and Esau in Shalev's novel. 14. For example, the twins' myopia is an allusion to the failing sight of Isaac, the biblical father of Jacob and Esau. Isaac himself does not appear here as a forefather of the dynasty (but his name is present through three secondary characters: Isaac Argas, the Jerusalem baker; Isaac Brinker, the farmer, who is a neighbor of the family of Abraham Levi in the village; and Isaac Edelman, the baker's ap- prentice who works for the Levi family in the village). Similarly, the name Benjamin is given not to Ja- cob's youngest son but to his firstborn. Most obvious of all is the transformation of the character Esau into an intellectual and spiritual type, "dwelling in tents" and loving books. 183</page><page sequence="12">Chaya Shacham of villas in a totally changed village. In his life, Jacob seems to embody the well- known Zionist value system in the Land of Israel, whose components are a foothold on the land, physical labor, and readiness to make sacrifices. But let there be no mistake: Jacob's Zionist story is not conveyed as a tale devoid of problems or crowned by a halo of idealization. It could be defined as Zionism of no alternative, or a late transformation of early Zionism in the Land of Israel: Jacob went off to settle in the village against his will and on account of his wife. True, he bakes bread with his own hands, but he himself has never worked the land (except for a short while when he stayed with his mother's family in Galilee); and the sacrifice of his firstborn son, killed in an army accident, he does not accept as divine rightness, but instead bitterly blames his son's officers and the army in general. By contrast, the novel's Esau embodies an existence based on other codes. He is an intellectual, who knowingly keeps his distance from physical labor; a cos- mopolitan who lives and creates far from the Land of Israel. He hallows his com- fortable life and displays a basic lack of commitment to the familiar Zionist set of values. In Jacob's words, "You read, write, fly off above us, don't want to know, don't want to get involved" (p. 156). In other words, Esau, as distinct from the Ja- cob of the novel, is the quintessence of what might be termed the post-Zionist en- tity. We find indirect support for this assertion in the words of Jacob, which are conveyed by Esau. The latter says that Jacob "claims I'm taking Mother 's stories apart and reconstructing them" (p. 74, emphasis added). "Mother's stories" in this novel are the historical memory of the exemplary family at its center, and, by in- ference, a diminutive analogous version, to some extent parodic, of historical memory concerning the Zionist enterprise. From the post-Zionist viewpoint, Esau creates a multiplicity of versions of the super-narrative. He does so by dismantling the core stories and rewriting them, not only in the "realistic" and "canonic" form evident on the surface of the novel but also in the imaginary and quasi-mythic ver- sions embedded in it.'5 These subvert the "canonic" tale, presenting at their cen- ter other voices, particularly those from the margins of the dominant story. Yet, the sharp, dichotomous, and "clean" division outlined above breaks down in the story itself again and again. Esau, who refuses to accept the bakery for himself as a bequest (p. 273), and who concedes Leah to his brother without a struggle, describes in retrospect a sense of symbiosis with his brother, which he feels from the distant west: "Because out of yearning, I lived Jacob's life; and out ofjealousy I thought his thoughts; and out of love I contemplated his son who was to be born" (p. 281). For his part, the mature Jacob, whose life is unbearable, de- 15. In his article "A Political Novel in the Service of the Left" (Nativ III [26], pp. 55-65, 1992) Yosef Oren attacks Meir Shalev's writing in Esau, describing the book as a political anti-Zionist nov- el, promoting the ideas of the Israeli left. Among other things he argues that "the only real bakery op- erating in Esau is the bakery in which Shalev himself concocted 'myths' to use to jeer at the national myths of the people of Israel" (ibid., p. 63). He sees the insertion of three independent stories into the novel as an attempt to prove "how easy it is to create 'myths,' and how imbecilic it is to rely on them in matters so fateful as peace and war, in the conflict with the Arab world on the question of Palestine" (ibid., p. 64). Clearly, Oren does not conceive at all the spirit of Shalev's postmodern attempt in this novel, and reads into it his own political views and assumptions. 184</page><page sequence="13">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? clares that he is ready to give his brother both the bakery and Leah: "You can take both of them. You can take everything" (p. 278).16 Romi, Jacob's daughter, contributes to the blurring of the lines separating the twin brothers. In appearance she takes after Esau and looks more like his daugh- ter, and not only because she is a redhead (her nickname, a corruption of "Roni," also suggests the resemblance; "Romi" alludes to the Romans, in whom the Jew- ish tradition sees Esau's decendants). Even her father recognizes the similarity when in a rage he snarls at the two of them: "Like you, just like you. Two rats! To eat without sweating, to enjoy without suffering, to see without glasses. You and your books, her and her camera. If you weren't related, I would have matched you up by now" (p. 234). Romi is of Jacob's stock, but in her father's eyes, and not only in his, she wholly constitutes a younger edition of his brother. The seemingly distinct bound- aries between the two representative characters at the center of the novel are there- fore breached; the significance of this on the novel's conceptual level is that it is no longer possible to speak of Zionism and its representations in the well-known and clear-cut traditional terms. Israeli identity as reflected in Jacob's successor generation is somewhat problematic. His firstborn, whom his father intended to inherit the bakery, is killed during his military service, and his daughter Romi has no interest at all in Jacob's life endeavor other than producing a museum-type exhibition of him through her photographs. These show Jacob at intimate, revealing moments, but especially at moments filled with anguish, signifying his life as a Jewish man in the Land of Is- rael. Michael, the delicate younger son of Jacob, begot in his old age, is in no way suited to assume his father's mantle. He is a daydreamer in pursuit of imagined vi- sions. Jacob hangs on to him like a drowning man clutching at straws, and tries to extract from his brother an admission of his son's resemblance to him (p. 243): "That's a son of old age, my last one, you saw yourself how much he looks like me. The spit and image of me." "He doesn't look like you at all," I said. "He doesn't look like anybody in our family." 16. In his article (n. 15) Oren expresses the view that the novel's plot centers on the rivalry be- tween the twins over a woman, Leah. Because he reads the novel as a political allegory, he sees this ri- valry as a metaphor for the conflict over Palestine between two who seek ownership (ibid., p. 57). Oren argues that the novel adopts the viewpoint of Esau as the deprived brother. Esau, according to him, sym- bolizes here the Arabs. He therefore subtitles his article ironically "The Story of the Wronged Broth- er" and reads the novel as a deliberate "leftist" move. Oren's perception, I believe, is one-dimensional and mistaken, taking a superficial view of the complex meanings of the novel. It rests, as I noted be- fore, on reading into the text predetermined notions, on the wish to discover in the text, come what may, immediate political layers of a certain kind. It eschews a careful reading of the book that takes its fin- er points into consideration. Contrary to Oren's view, Kobi Freund (see n. 12) argues, rightly, that Esau is not a political book in the simple sense of the term, although its texture is saturated with political and social contents (ibid., p. 37). 185</page><page sequence="14">Chaya Shacham On the conceptual level of the novel, Michael is a late genetic mutation, il- lustrating the distancing of the new generation from its roots. Michael's feet are not planted on the ground like the feet of his grandfather the peasant, the Galilean convert, or like the feet of his father the baker, who stands on them tirelessly throughout his working hours. Symbolically, Michael is described as "floating"- his feet do not touch the ground at all, as his crippled relative Shimon mostly car- ries him about in his arms. Conceptually, the novel therefore unfolds toward an ending that seems to make a pessimistic statement regarding Zionist-Israeli reality and its future. But precisely in its closing lines it offers a surprise, because the ending, through metonymy (by means of the smell of bread rising in the nostrils of Esau, the nar- rator), relates that Jacob is continuing, despite all, to keep watch over life, work, and existence. The ending of Esau calls to mind the ending ofYosef Haim Brenner's novel From Here and There. In their endings, the two works speak of the day brighten- ing after the rain, and of baking bread, as signs of renewal and a grasp of life. Arye Lapidot, the protagonist of the ending of From Here and There, is perceived in the story as the Job of the Zionist endeavor. He has lost his son and grandson, and he is dismissed from his work; his family members are sick, his second son emigrates from the country, and his family is reduced to abject poverty. But the closing scene opens a window of hope. Arye and his grandson are collecting twigs to light a fire under the oven in which the bread is to be baked. The grandson, keeping watch on life with his grandfather, constitutes a glimmer of light that illumines, if faintly, the obscure future. The ending of Esau promises nothing at that moment regarding Jacob's progeny and their father's enterprise. However, Jacob himself returns immediate- ly upon the death of his father, Abraham, when he himself becomes the elder of the tribe, to stand steadfast at the oven and to bake bread as was his custom. Esau concludes his story: "The rain had stopped, the sky was clear, and the smell rose up from the bakery of my brother Jacob" (p. 345). In Tammuz's novel, discussed earlier, the hero, Jacob, defines himself in a moment of fright as "the last of the Jews." It is perhaps not too much to see Jacob in Shalev's novel as the model, serious or parodic, of the last of the Zionists. IV This study of two recent novels shows quite clearly how far contemporary Hebrew writing related to biblical matters has strayed from Jacob Fichman's as- sertion in the preface to his book Images of Old that "a work on a biblical subject is the ancient world in combination with modern perception."" But how right he was in another statement: "It is not that the thing is not like the source that causes it to fail, but that it is alike archaeologically, too much. Clearly, in the first place, a repetition of the Bible we do not need" (ibid., p. 13). Indeed, their respective aesthetic strategies take these two authors far from 17. See Yaakov Fichman, "Bible as a Subject for Poetry," Images of Old, Bialik Institute, 1948, pp. 11-15. The excerpts are from p. 13. 186</page><page sequence="15">Jew, Zionist, Hebrew, or Israeli? an "archaeological" restoration of the biblical image in the sense applied by Ahad Ha'am, who distinguishes historical truth from archaeological truth.18 At the same time, these works are not to be defined as modem perceptions of the ancient world, as Fichman proposes. Each author in his own way and according to his own needs selects, dismantles and remolds the relevant components from the ancient story, integrating and embedding them in the new flow. Thus, they undergo a metamor- phosis, subject to the unique statement of each of the works. Despite their reliance on particular episodes from old Jacob's story, the two writers use the biblical ma- terials entirely freely. In the novels, the biblical figure of Jacob becomes for the most part a peg on which to hang ideological perceptions and present-day notions. In his novel Tammuz makes no attempt to disguise this fact. Although his story clings to a distinctly biblical-mythical focus-Jacob's wrestling with the angel- the course of the narrative in Jacob allows the modem materials great indepen- dence. In certain sections of the novel (e.g., the entire third part, which relates Ja- cob's experiences in Paris), they actually move far from the biblical foundation and allow an unimpeded view of the ideological layer.19 By contrast, in Esau, Shalev plays a game of hide-and-seek with the biblical tale, now warmer, now colder, and he weaves independent stories of fantastic bent into the flow of the text. These de- vices hinder "automatic" locating of contemporary political statements in their full sense, although these statements are undoubtedly there. Despite the autonomy of present-day materials in both novels, the new texts make a point of preserving the old text by means of intertextual allusions to it (e.g., motifs, parts of a story line, names of characters, full or partial excerpts, etc.). These means are made to serve the specific needs of the writers, each in his way.20 Yet, it is interesting that in both novels the allusions to the biblical text do not ac- 18. In the sense given to this concept by Ahad Ha'am in his well-known essay "Moses." There, Ahad Ha'am distinguishes historical truth from archaeological truth. The first concerns forces acting on and influencing the life of human society, even if they are nothing but imaginary. The second con- cerns the precise reconstruction of facts, as they existed in reality, and which can be verified or refut- ed through archaeological finds. See Ahad Ha'am, "Moses," At the Parting of the Ways. Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1952. 19. Gila Ramras-Rauch ("Biblical Infrastructure in the Narratives of Benjamin Tammuz."I In: Link Franz [ed.], Paradeigmata, 1989, pp. 621-628) discusses the evocation of the biblical by Tam- muz as both poetic and political: "Poetically, he creates an infrastructure to a story embedded with al- legory and myth. Politically, he sees repeating patterns in historical evolution .. ." (ibid., pp. 626-627). In addition to Jacob, Ramras-Rauch refers to Tammuz's The Orchard (1971). 20. In the preface to their book Biblical Patterns in Modern Literature (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1984), the editors David. H. Hirsch and Nehama Aschkenasy note the existence of two ways of treating biblical material in works that take the Bible story as its starting point: "The first method, in which the dramatic potentials inherent in the Biblical yarn are released, and the sparse tale is allowed to develop and expand, has been utilized in such different forms as the irreverent, secularized versions of medieval 'mystery plays,' and Thomas Mann's solemn recreation of the saga of Joseph and his broth- ers. The second method, in which the Biblical material is a supporting structure for a new story, in which Biblical images and connotations bring to light the subterranean layers of that story, has been repre- sented in Western literature in works by the great masters such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and others" (p. 2). The works discussed here make use of biblical materials in a way close to the second method, although they are to be seen as variants special to these writers, as emerges from the analyses in the body of this article. 187</page><page sequence="16">Chaya Shacham quire the status of irony-which we have become accustomed to finding in mod- em Hebrew writers from Agnon to A.

It was not written by God, and its heroes are not holy and pure," says Meir Shalev in the preface to his book Bible Now.21 In this he sums up not only his own position on the Book of Books but also that of many modern Hebrew storytellers, for whom the Bible was an inseparable part of their education but in no way the foundation of their faith.
