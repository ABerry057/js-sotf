New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. lxxxvi, 618 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000591 It is not unusual for books on Jewish themes to seek to address both a pro fessional "academic Jewish studies" audience and the nonprofessional "literate 1.

What is unusual is for a book to address each audience in such a way as to dare both to go beyond the normal "comfort zones" of the "academic" and "popular Judaica" genres?to induce, so to speak, each type of reader to participate with comfort in a genre neither has really bargained for. This is precisely what Howard Schwartz, the well-known poet, translator, editor, and educator, seems to be attempting in this enormous collection of superbly chosen, arranged, translated, and expounded texts form virtually all genres and eras of Jewish literature. For each audience, Schwartz provides just enough of the familiar generic landmarks to make readers feel at home on "familiar" ground. Academics will find a carefully worked-out typology of Jewish mythology, with no less than ten basic categories of myth, each meticulously refracted into diverse, well-ident ified subgenres. They will find a collection of texts from a dazzling array of primary sources, with translations, notes, and bibliographical guidance to serious scholarly literature. This will make them feel invited into a project much like those they might have studied in graduate school and, even, much like one they might undertake on their own in a related area. The "Jewish reader" of good taste, in the same measure, will also feel invited into a discursive world in which the parameters are clearly demarcated and reason ably familiar. When addressing, in his compendious introduction, the nature of "myth," for example, Schwartz offers a bare-bones, accessible definition: "A people's sacred stories about origins, deities, ancestors, and heroes" (xliv). His footnote goes on to reassure readers that he does not mean his sense of "myth" to imply that the stories are untrue from some empirical perspective (lxxviii n. 5). Schwartz makes no effort to move beyond this quite common but rather banal definition (which hardly requires a footnote) into some of the truly discomfiting meditations on myth and history as parallel discursive practices that preoccupy postmodern theorists of historiography in general, and religious historiography in particular. Here the "general reader's" sense of familiarity is pri vileged over what the "scholarly reader" might prefer?for example, a first-class consideration of contemporary thinking about the relation of myth to historical narrative. Such a contribution?which would contribute as well to theorizing about myth in general?might have transformed the book's subtitle, "The Mythol ogy of the Jews," into more than a sensationalist marketing ploy. In an age in which even Conservative rabbis acknowledge the unhistorical character of the Torah's narratives, it is hard to imagine that many contemporary, nonspecialist Jewish audiences (beyond ArtScroll subscribers) would be stopped short by Schwartz's concept of "myth." Similarly, we should not be surprised that a volume on Jewish mythology that includes "Myths of the Holy People" as one of its organizing typologies verifies the existence of the "Holy People" with a com pendious selection of tales from elite and folk that transcend time and space to yield the impression of a people that is truly immortal in its spatio-temporal ubi quity, a veritable 'am 'olam! But, as I indicated earlier, there is just enough here that defamiliarizes the landscape for each sort of reader. Academics, I suspect, will wonder just exactly where Schwartz's texts come from. Though the proximate literary source of most texts is cited where available, many are cited from multiple sources. 368</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Schwartz does not clarify which version he is translating or whether, and in what way, he might be recasting the sources (? la Bialik's Sefer ha-Aggadah in its day) to improve their readability for a "nonprofessional" audience. Very often, the professional scholar may suspect that he or she is getting the same kind of "authenticity" that Martin Buber offered a century ago to German readers of his version of hasidic stories?which is to say, the German reader got the Hasidism that Buber wished Hasidism to have been rather than the Hasidism that served as the matrix of the sippurei ma 'asiyot or the shivhei haBesht. Moreover, for academic specialists, there is always the question of context and the amount of weight a given text might have within the overall tradition. Schwartz as editor takes a certain Levi-Straussian (or maybe Eliadean) delight in the privileging of multiple testimony over the creation of context and interpret ation in situ. This might prove a bit vertiginous to historically trained readers. In the section on "Myths of the Messiah," subsection "The Heavenly Messiah," for example, one can find texts drawn in sequence from Maimonides (twelfth-century Egypt), the tales of Rabbi Nahman (early nineteenth-century Russia), 4 Ezra (Second Temple Roman Palestine), Yalkut Shimoni (early geonic Middle East), Genesis Rabbah (Byzantine Palestine), and a text attributed to Abraham of Granada, the Brit Menuhah (486-88). Though the "general reader" is usually assumed to be reliably impressed by such diverse testimony to a given idea, most specialists will raise the historian's version of the Talmud's "what has the sabbatical year to do with Mt. Sinai?" On balance, though, I think the book as a whole is rather more geared to the "general reader" than the "academic." But if so, this is either a "general reader" with lots of time and patience or one who simply buys impressive tomes to leave around the house for company to notice. The volume is encyclopedic in scope and, except for the remarkably elegant translations, the prose of the commen taries is dense in that common discourse of academic exposition. Even though jargon free, Schwartz's expositions make strong demands on the reader's attention; I, for one, wonder whether such demands are fair of any but the academic reader, who would have a professional stake in mastering the material that Schwartz pre sents. This is not a book to read from beginning to end. It seems meant for dipping into randomly. But the attention required for such a dip is not minimal and may dissuade all but the most committed of "general readers," who, after all, are under no obligation to demonstrate that they have actually read the book about which they are offering pronouncements. Professional readers, however, may not have the patience either, as Schwartz's acontexrualist selection of sources and lack of interest in specifying precisely which text he is rendering will prove to demand of the reader's the legwork that is properly the author's task. To conclude: Schwartz has produced a work that will probably frustrate each of his chosen audiences as much as it will nourish them. For the "general reader," I suspect that less would have been more?a simpler, less compendious volume with elegant translations and modest commentary would have more than made the point that traditional Jewish thought has a mythological structure that can be ignored only at the risk of seriously misreading its nature and intentions. This point is offered little enough to the "general reader" and is well worth forceful 369</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews presentation. For the "Jewish studies professional reader," there is not enough of the expected academic scaffolding that would offer readers confidence that Schwartz's selection criteria and translational method were truly of a caliber to make his work, if not the "last word," at least "an important step forward" in clar ifying the mythic unity of a putative classical Jewish folk imagination.
