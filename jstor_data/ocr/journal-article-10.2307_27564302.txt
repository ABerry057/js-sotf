<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dan Levene. A Corpus of Magic Bowls: Incantation Texts in Jewish Aramaic from Late Antiquity. London: Kegan Paul, 2003. xiv, 223 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000633 In 1888, J. P. Peters, excavating the ancient town of Nippur in southern Iraq for the University of Pennsylvania, discovered, in what he termed a "Jewish settle ment," that food bowls had been buried upside down under the thresholds of houses. These bowls were inscribed on the inside in spirals with incantation texts in Babylonian Jewish Aramaic, Syriac, and Mandaic. Since James A. Mon tgomery published his seminal edition of forty bowls in 1913, more bowls in Jewish Aramaic have been published by Cyrus Gordon, Mark Geller, Joseph Naveh, Shaul Shaked, and several others, not to mention publications of Mandaic and Syriac bowls by Edwin Yamaguchi, Isaac Jerusalmi, and others. As of this writing, more than a thousand of these bowls are known to exist, making them the single largest inscriptional source for Judaism in late antiquity. Several hundred await publication, particularly those in the private collection of Martin Schoyen, which are to be published shortly by Shaul Shaked. The full significance of the magical bowls has yet to be assessed. They are sources for information about individual Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans from talmudic Babylonia; allude to the Bible, Talmud, Hekhalot literature, and the New Testament; and provide essential evidence for several dialects of Aramaic. Yet the bowls have not been fully integrated into the history of religions in late antiquity. A few brief synthetic studies by Jacob Neusner, Shaul Shaked, Rebecca Lesses, Ra'anan Boustan, and others point the way to how this corpus can deepen our understanding of the social and cultural environment in which the Babylonian rabbinate, early Jewish mysticism, and Zoroastrian influences interacted. However, a thorough description of the religious phenomenon and social classes represented by the bowls has not been attempted since Montgom ery's original introduction to his publication. In the meantime, the discovery and publication of new bowls is making the picture more complete. Dan Levene's A Corpus of Magic Bowls is a significant contribution to this field. The volume is an edition of twenty magical bowls from the private collection of Dr. Shlomo Moussaieff. Although no direct information is available about their provenance, their physical features, language, and paleography are consistent with the extant Babylonian magical bowls from the fourth to seventh centuries CE. In a few cases, some information is available about their excavation. Of these, only one was published before, in a 1999 article by the author (Jewish Studies Quarterly 6). 377</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Several of the bowls are duplicates of other extant bowls, including M150, which parallels a bowl from Montgomery's corpus and therefore links it to Nippur. The volume begins with a thirty-page introduction and includes transcriptions (fortu nately, in Hebrew type), translations, and philological commentaries to the bowls, as well as a glossary, indexes of personal names, angelic and demonic names, and biblical verses. Photographs of the bowls are also included. Unfortu nately, some of the plates are not are clear as one would wish, especially as several bowls include drawings of demons and other creatures. Given the technical limit ations of such a volume, one option would be to provide close-ups or transcrip tions of those drawings. Levene includes a substantial introduction in which he discusses such topics as the linguistic features of the corpus, the evidence for scribal practices, and the relationship between the bowls and other corpora of Jewish literature, especially Hekhalot literature and Jewish liturgy. A particularly useful discussion, continued in the commentary to two bowls, M50 and M103, is a detailed comparison of the demonic "divorce" formula found frequently in the bowls and the standard get formula. Levene's discussion of this question in the commentary to Bowl M103 (58-62) is full of insight. The edition of the texts themselves consists of transcrip tions, translations, and commentaries. One of the chief virtues of Levene's commen tary is his use of synoptic tables to illustrate the parallels and variations between duplicate bowls, as well as parallels between bowl formulae and parallels from non magical literature. These tables add to our understanding of how the makers of the bowls exercised their creativity and adapted formulae for their individual needs. Levene has also benefited from access to unpublished bowls in the Schoyen and other collections. Transcriptions of three bowls in that collection appear in the synop tic tables to bowls M145 and M103, and others are quoted in the commentaries. The bowls that constitute this corpus are of considerable interest, not only because they add to our knowledge of magic in Jewish Babylonia but also because of several details. These details fall into two basic categories: points of intersection between the magical bowls and other corpora, especially liturgical and mystical literatures, and details that tell us more about how the bowls func tioned. In the first category, of particular interest is a line in Bowl Ml01 that is parallel to a passage from Hekhalot Rabbati.1 In Hekhalot Rabbati, the passage appears in one of the so-called Gedulah hymns, in which the powers available to the traveler to the Merkavah are praised. There, it is said that that "three times a day an announcement goes out from the heavenly courts that anyone who belittles him is placed under a ban by T'ZSH YY, God of Israel, his crown, and his throne." In the bowl, the same phrase is used to place the demons under the ban. There is a good chance that the magical text adopted the phrase from Hekhalot Rabbati and thus the text may attest to the influence of Hekhalot literature. Bowls in which phrases from the statutory Babylonian Jewish liturgy appear include M102, M108, and Ml 17; M108 contains the earliest attestation to the Hashkivenu prayer for the evening Shema'. 1. Peter Sch?fer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1981), ?92. 378</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The corpus also adds a few details to the paltry body of evidence for how the bowls were used in magical ritual. Bowls M50 and 59, duplicate texts by different scribes, declare that the magician is "casting and drawing a lot and making a (magical) act"; he also declares that he has "ascended concerning you ... on high" (32), raising a possibility that visionary practices, or at least claims of ascent, may have been used to strengthen the power of the magician. Bowls M155 and M156 were found nested one within the other. Bowl M163, a curse text designed to subdue or "press" Isha son of Ifra Hurmiz, instructs, "Under this white cock that [is appointed on your behalf], just so may this Isha son of Ifra son of Hurmiz be pressed ... under the feet and command and authority of this Mihlad and (this) Baran sons of Mirdukh" (124). As Levene points out, the use of a white rooster for malevolent and erotic magic is known from such manuals as Sefer ha-Razim, Greek magical papyri, and other sources. Overall, Levene has produced an excellent model for the publication of a corpus of magical bowls. The transcriptions and translations are clear, the com mentary is pertinent and judicious, and much useful supplementary material is included. This volume is a welcome addition to the growing body of scholarship on ancient Jewish magic and Babylonian Judaism. Michael D. Swartz The Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio</page></plain_text>
