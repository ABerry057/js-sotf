<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arthur A. Goren. The Politics and Public Culture ofAmerican Jews: The Modern Jewish Experience. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999. 274 pp. This volume is a collection of ten studies previously published by the author. Its theme is the "unfolding communal life of American Jews-the way Jews trans- planted, changed and invented their social institutions and ideologies and created over time an impressive organizational culture" (p. 9). Each chapter, originally con- ceived as an independent article, has substantial depth and a richness of historical detail. The volume is unified by a sustained, if prismatic, attention to two topics. The first is the internal (that is, Jewish communal) and external (that is, civic and American) politics of twentieth-century American Jews. The second is what the au- thor calls their "public culture." By public culture he refers to the large public events such as mass rallies, funerals, parades, and pageants that marked American Jewish life, particularly in New York, in the first half of the twentieth century. Public cul- ture provided an expressive metier for socialist or Zionist politics. It gave expres- sion to the collective identities of Jewish subgroups or, on occasion, to the entire community. The treatment of public culture is reminiscent of George Mosse's work on the role of public rituals in European and Jewish nationalism. The materials that the author treats are highly diverse. The first part of the book focuses on the politics and public culture of the immigrant and second gen- erations up until World War II. The author explores how the immigrants negotiat- ed their newfound "Americanness" through an analysis of the ideology of plural- ism. He analyzes Jewish electoral politics in a case study of the congressional elections of 1908 and 1910, where a Socialist candidate, Meyer London, was elect- ed from the Lower East Side. An especially engaging chapter considers the polit- ical orientation-and skills-of Orthodox Jews, as refracted through their Yiddish newspapers. Far from being political naifs, some Orthodox Jewish leaders were se- rious actors in national and municipal politics, had high-level access to the politi- cal echelon, including the president (at a 1912 fundraiser for the Daughters of Ja- cob Old Age Home, the guest of honor was William Howard Taft), and were trusted supporters of the Republican party. Although this chapter does not present itself as a background for current Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox political activism, it helps, at least inadvertently, to set it in context. In general, however, the subject matter of the first part of the book seems resolutely antique. Neither Jewish socialists nor the mass events carefully described in chapters on funerals and mass meetings have much resonance in post-war Jewish America. It is unclear whether Israel Day pa- rades or the mass meetings that took place after the assassination of Yitzhak Ra- 164</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews bin descend from these early events or whether the political culture of American Jews has so changed that the comparison is at best superficial. In the second part of the book, a political culture more akin to our own comes into view. Charting the post-war Jewish scene, the author considers how the early fragmentation of the community (over socialism, Zionism, religion, and class) gave way to greater cohesion, the latter brought about by the twin challenges of helping the survivors of the Shoah and supporting the State of Israel. The largely consensual nature of these urgent tasks called for a rational, professional, and man- agerial style. The great leaders of the prior half century gave way to effective ad- ministrators. The author suggests that vigorous partisanship is an existence condi- tion for statesmanlike leadership. In a chapter on the "Golden Decade" of 1945- 1955, the author analyzes the consolidation of the liberal politics that continues to characterize American Jewish political culture to the present. American Jews found an elective affinity between their own liberal inclinations and the "aggres- sive liberalism" (p. 188) rising in American political culture. Exactly what ac- counts for the presence of this liberalism among American Jews in the first place is, however, insufficiently explored. The closest we get to an answer is the asser- tion that "To a considerable degree, the Red Scare hastened the political integra- tion of American Jews. It greatly weakened Jewish radicalism, fortified the liber- alism of "the vital center" and drew American Jews, as never before, into a whirl of "American" issues" (p. 201). The book concludes with a fascinating look into the contentious inner workings of the American Jewish Committee over the limits of liberalism in the face of nascent multiculturalism. This topical survey cannot do justice to the subtle interplay between the chap- ters or to the wealth of insight and perspective that the author brings to the Jewish experience of civic and political engagement. On a critical note, one might wonder why the author does not make use of the concept of "political culture" rather than the more ambiguous "public culture" or the somewhat over-extended "politics." Un- like an empirical study of American Jewish political behavior such as we expect from a political scientist, this is really a book about norms, worldviews, symbols, cultural trends, and moods. These features are captured by the analytic concept of political culture. It is somewhat perplexing that the author did not make use of it.
