<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael L. Satlow. Jewish Marriage in Antiquity. Princeton and Oxford: Prince- ton University Press, 2001. xxvi, 431 pp. This book contains a full review of Jewish marriage in antiquity, beginning with biblical injunctions, but focusing primarily on postbiblical material and specifically on rabbinic literature. It is divided into three parts: 1. Thinking about Marriage, in which Satlow describes how and why Jewish marriages were planned, 2. Marrying, in which he describes the process of marriage itself, and 3. Staying 354</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Married, in which married life and its consequences are at issue. In each of these parts Satlow correctly attempts to draw a line between the ideals of marriage as portrayed in the sources and what actually went on, as far as these allow us a glimpse of reality. In this book Michael Satlow establishes himself as the foremost scholar of Jewish marriage in antiquity. Yet, he is clearly also interested in the present, and he is very forthcoming about this. He starts his book by stating that a "careful study of the past can contribute ... to the contemporary discussion of marriage" (p. xvi), and ends it with a long epilogue justifying the relevance of his study for marital debates within Jewish society in America today (pp. 265-71). In other, less explicit terms, Satlow's work is a product of our times. His study is free from any apologetics in his description of ancient Jewish marriage practices. He has no problem describing polygyny as the marital norm for Jews (pp. 189-92). He elaborates on the shockingly practical, economic/contractual rather than romantic/sentimental character of Jewish marriage at the time (pp. 233- 42). He even states, against most Jewish commentators, that "in ancient Semitic law and among Jews in the prerabbinic period, the right to divorce was bilateral: a husband or wife could initiate a divorce" (p. 214). The other indication that this study was written in the 1990s is Satlow's use of relatively new methodological presuppositions. He constantly distinguishes between rabbinic documents that date from early and late times, which do not complement one another but, rather, stand in chronological tension, and prove development or reaction rather than painting a stable picture of reality. Further- more, rabbinic literature was composed in two very different geographical lo- cations and under two different regimes-in Roman Palestine and in Persian (Sassanian) Babylonia. Satlow is continuously alert to this fact and would nev- er confuse a source from one place or time with the other. All scholars of rab- binic literature today take these presuppositions for granted, but it was not always so, and for the question of marriage, this is the first study that consistently adopts this approach. The distinction between Palestinian and Babylonian sources informs Sat- low's most important and consistent thesis throughout the book. He asserts that al- though the Palestinian and Babylonian rabbis were in constant dialogue with one another on the meaning of Jewish marriage, in the final analysis they endorsed two completely different approaches to the issue, driven by the two cultures in which they lived. The Palestinian rabbis, living in the Greco-Roman world, saw the pur- pose of marriage as the founding of a "household." This means that marriage was inherently good. The Babylonian rabbis, who lived under Persian-Sassanian rule and in a Zoroastrian culture, viewed marriage as an outlet for a man's sexual urges. It is thus fundamentally a concession. Satlow's argument throughout the book flows from this premise and one is impressed by the parallels he brings to support his claims, not just from the well-researched Greco-Roman culture, but also from the Sassanian world. All this is intended as praise for the book. My two last comments are in the form of critique. The first is the apparent mistrust of the Orient displayed by the author. He suggests that as far removed from our marital ideals as Palestinian Jew- 355</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ish marriage may appear, its Babylonian variety epitomizes all that we abhor. For example, Satlow discusses sayings on marriage attributed to Babylonians and to Palestinians, writing: "In Palestine, according to the tradition ... a wife is ei- ther ... bad or ... good" but for the Babylonians "all wives to some extent are evil" (p. 9). Thus, if women, according to the Babylonians, are evil, then so is mar- riage. Wives should be treated with disgust and contempt. This will hardly allow for a marriage of trust that we in the West envision. This identification of a re- sounding Babylonian negation of women informs the rest of Satlow's study. I do not doubt that Satlow has indeed shown a deep cultural rift between Babylonian and Palestinian rabbis, but I suspect the language of revulsion he uses toward the Babylonian customs stems from his modem sensibilities regarding the Orient. Al- though the Greco-Romans are hardly the Christian west, and Zoroastrian Persia was certainly not today's Islamic world, geographically, they did occupy respec- tively the same spaces that these cultures occupy today. Satlow's presentation of these marriage customs reflects our modem world in a disturbing way. I am sure the Babylonians deserve a more nuanced treatment and a less stereotypical inter- pretation than they received here. Finally, I want to touch on Satlow's difficult relationship with feminist stud- ies. Although living in an age when feminist studies dominate the academic scene, and although this is Satlow's second book touching specifically on issues that involve women to a great extent,1 Satlow chooses to distance himself from this dis- cipline. This decision also reflects on the way the entire book is composed. It be- gins on the very first page. There, Satlow cites a rabbinic tradition and paraphrases it with the words, "Our darshan clearly states that a man should marry .. ." and then states why. Yet, he never discusses the reasons that women should marry. This attitude is evident throughout the book. Here is, in my opinion, the most resound- ing example: Satlow interprets "rape" as a strategy couples may have adopted to circumvent parental authority and marry (pp. 124-29). I find this suggestion a male fantasy that completely ignores the real dangers of rape and the extremely traumatic character of biblical and postbiblical rape laws primarily for the raped woman-who is now compelled to marry the rapist.
