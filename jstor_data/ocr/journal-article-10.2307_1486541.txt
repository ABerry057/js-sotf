<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark K. Bauman and Berkley Kalin, eds. The Quiet Voices: Southern Rabbis and Black Civil Rights, 1880s to 1990s. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997. x, 444 pp. Jews have long been in the vanguard of the struggle for civil liberties in America. But as this excellent new collection edited by Mark Bauman and Berkley Kalin demonstrates, the American Jewish community's reaction to the black civil rights movement was less enthusiastic than many may realize or be willing to accept. The Quiet Voices, as its subtitle implies, purports to be the story of southern rabbis in the struggle against segregation. Indeed, a great deal of the collection is devoted to biographies and memoirs of southern rabbis who worked to end segregation and challenged their congregations to do the same. To my mind, however, many of the collection's most provocative points concern northern Jewish ambivalence toward African-Americans and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 175 integration. The title could thus be seen as having a double meaning, alluding both to the rabbis' prophetic convictions spoken softly and to other, more muted Jewish responses to black struggle. The collection is built around two powerful themes. The first is the tremendous conviction of many of these mostly Reform rabbis that the prophetic tradition in Judaism required them to speak out against segregation even when this upset their congregants and endangered their lives and the lives of their families. The second theme is the precarious position of Jews in southern white society. While northern Jewish leaders may have recognized that working to end racial prejudice served their own interests, southern Jews realized that too loud a confrontation with Jim Crow would bring them into the line of fire. But while northern Jews may have supported the civil rights struggle, they were less delighted by the encroachment of blacks into their neighborhoods, and like many whites, they took flight to the suburbs. The collection is divided into four parts. The first looks at three rabbis who served in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The second part, "The Heyday," skips ahead to the period following the Second World War. Introducing the section is the collection's most provocative essay, "'Hamans' and 'Torquemadas': Southern and Northern Jewish Responses to the Civil Rights Movement, 1945-1965" by Marc Dollinger. It criticizes both southern and northern Jews for their often ambivalent attitudes toward black civil rights and for not fully understanding the dire situation that faced African-Americans in this era. If we seek an answer to the question of why the once-strong political bonds between African-Americans and Jews have weakened, Dollinger says we need to look no further than Jewish political activity during the height of civil rights agitation in the 1950s and 1960s. Jewish political organizations were focused on promoting equality of opportunity while American blacks were quite literally fighting for their lives. This fundamental lack of understanding about the realities of African- American life coupled with African-American misreading of the actual power of the Jewish community was bound to cause friction. The third part of the collection contains memoirs of three prominent southern rabbis, Jacob Rothschild, Malcolm Stem, and Myron Berman. The book is completed by Micah D. Greenstein and Howard Greenstein's essay "'Then and Now:' Southern Rabbis and Civil Rights." This father-and-son team, both rabbis who have served in a variety of southern pulpits, update the story. Though observers of southern Jewish culture had early on speculated that the so-called black-Jewish coalition was less solid than many assumed,</page><page sequence="3">176 BOOK REVIEWS the Greensteins note that the parting of ways between African-Americans and Jews reflects the growing differences in the position of these communities in American society. For all intents and purposes Jews have made it, and southern rabbis are no longer focused on the issues that brought them into common cause with African-American ministers. This is not to say that southern rabbis no longer devote themselves to civil rights, but often it is a common threat that brings the two communities together. For all the voices represented, the collection almost ignores Orthodox and Conservative rabbis in the South. Women are also underrepresented. Helen Jacobson, who worked alongside her husband, Rabbi David Jacobson, for integration in San Antonio, Texas, is one of the few exceptions. Nonetheless, this collection hangs together very well. The editors have not neglected those rabbis who did not join the civil rights battle. Nor have they ignored the difficult position facing southern Jews, caught in the middle between the demands of social justice and the precariousness of their own position in white southern society. And northern Jews who remember themselves as having been at the heart of the civil rights struggle may see a very different face reflected back to them. All in all, this is a carefully crafted and subtle collection that will interest scholars of American Jewish history, black-Jewish relations, and the American civil rights movement. Jay M.
