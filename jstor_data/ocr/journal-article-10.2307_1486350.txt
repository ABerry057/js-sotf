<plain_text><page sequence="1">t ON THE irop'yos AS A FARM BUILDING By DANIEL SPERBER Bar Ilan University In Hermes, LIV (1919), F. Preisigke discussed the term rbp'yos , sug- gesting inter alia, that it bears the meaning of a "farm building" ' on the basis of papyrological sources. In the following year in the same journal, E. Meyer2 supported this contention, pointing out the suitability of such a meaning for such NT passages as Mark 12:1 = Matthew 21:33 (and, to a lesser extent, Luke 14:20).3 The discussion was succinctly summarized in Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary of the Greek Testament, s.v. 7rbpyos .4 The NT passages referred to above use the word rbpyos in just the same way as the OT uses the Hebrew word migdal. Indeed the passage in Mark (and Matthew) stylistically derives from Isaiah 5:2, where the He- brew migdal is rendered by irpros in the LXX. In these contexts rbp'yos denotes a building in a vineyard, presumably serving to protect it, but also in all likelihood containing implements connected with its up- keep. In a general sense it might very rightfully be called a "farm build- ing," and not merely a tower. 1. Pp. 423-32. 2. Hermes, LV (1920), 100-102. 3. See H. C. Strack and P.

Admittedly some scholars have tried to identify this word with the Greek 4pobpLov .7 This suggestion, however, has rightfully been rejected as forced,s and the ob- vious candidate is pirpyos. Indeed, the different forms can only be ex- plained by reference to this word. Thus, the form burgin derives from the acc. vrpYov (burgon), while the form burgas (in)-the -in being the pl. termination-derives from the nom. form irbp'yo (burgos).g Further- .nore, in T. Eruvin 2.910 we find the forms burganin (pl.) or burgin (sing., according to Ms. London), while Ms. Erfurt has a variant reading: trgis. Now trgis as it stands makes no sense, and must obviously be emended to pirgis." The pe and the yod of pirgis were joined together to form a tet, thus giving rise to the corrupt trgis. Pirgis is obviously rbp~ryos, and it is just this (restored) reading which confirms the identification of all these forms with irbpyos = irpyov (burgon), etc. Now the Tosefta Eruvin just referred to specifically states these burganin to be in a field. (And so also in the parallels in B. Eruvin 22a and 55b.) It suggests itself, therefore, that here too we are talking of buildings or structures connected with the tending of fields as well as with their protec- tion.12 As such it is understandable that they be coupled with other farm buildings, such as zerifin and 'aleqtiyot,"' cone-shaped huts '4 and frames or trellises covered with creepers,'5 structures of differing rustic 5.
