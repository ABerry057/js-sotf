<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Bolchover. British Jewry and the Holocaust. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. xi, 208 pp. This book is two removes from the actual Holocaust. There are studies of the Holocaust itself, concentration camps and killings as well as resistance. Once removed is the sizable literature about proposals, policies, and attempts at rescue, and how they usually failed or were sidestepped by the anti-Nazi nations. At two removes from the Holocaust are works like the present</page><page sequence="2">466 BOOK REVIEWS one, which does not deal with the Nazis' deeds nor with attempts to save Jews, but instead "outline[s] the British Jewish community's socio-political philosophy and demonstrate[s] how it shaped this Jewry's response to the fate of European Jewry between 1942 and 1945" (p. 144). This is the converse of what Richard Bolchover states at the outset, that he "examines what the community's response to this historical experience reveals about its own organisational structure and socio-political philosophy" (p. 1). Although the author says that he starts in 1939 (p. 3), he really begins in 1933, which is more reasonable for a study of "socio-political philosophy" in its bearing on Nazism and the Holocaust. There is promise in this approach, since it may allow for a deeper understanding of the many failures and few successes of rescue attempts. Bolchover finds that Anglo-Jewry did little more than eloquently deplore what was happening to the Jews on the Continent and express its faith in ultimate triumph. The biblical paraphrases mingled with rage of Chief Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz provide the main religious evidence. Since the author has placed Hertz's tireless attempts at rescue outside the defined framework of the book, his powerful rhetoric may ring hollow. The president of the Board of Deputies during the war and as such the lay head of British Jewry was Selig Brodetsky, a son of the East End who was a professor of mathematics and the leader of British Zionism. He comes off poorly, since Bolchover generally sees wartime Zionist endeavors as a refuge from the intractable problem of rescuing Jews. But Brodetsky was not a Jew of the "emancipation contract," and his wartime speeches and articles display sober realism. Brodetsky's remark in his memoirs about not having known the full extent of the Holocaust during the war is in contrast with what he said when the mass murder was in full swing. What was this "emancipation contract" to which Bolchover often refers as a key to the public attitudes of English Jews? He means that they "saw emancipation in England as a contract such that the Gentile state and nation promised civic equality to the Jews, and the Jews promised to be solely a religious community marked only by a particular system of faith and worship, and to abandon all non-theological 'national' qualities" (p. 79). The author holds that Anglo-Jewry during World War II and at other times was ridden by a "politics of hope" and a "politics of fear," which arose respectively from fidelity to the contract and from fear of the consequences of violating it. A high group profile or political demands constituted a violation. However,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 467 none of the author's source citations from the Holocaust period refers to any "emancipation contract." The extended debates of the 1850s over Jewish emancipation also did not speak of it. The great majority of British Jews, especially the large number who provided simple humane aid to arriving refugees, probably never heard of it. In fact there was never any "contract." There is valuable information in Bolchover's book, but unfortunately he does not really get to his subject until page 54 of its 156 pages of text. British Jewry and the Holocaust takes its place among the many books which have as their subject Jewish communities untouched but morally scarred by the Holocaust. For all the useful information it conveys, Bolchover's book shares the insistently judgmental character of most of them. A half-century after the horrific events, one would hope for a more dispassionate view. Lloyd P. Gartner Tel Aviv University Ramat-Aviv, Israel</page></plain_text>
