Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2005. xii, 264 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000773 In Ladino Rabbinic Literature and Ottoman Sephardic Culture, Matthias Lehmann approaches the subject of the Jewish encounter with modernity by analyz ing the content and reception of Judeo-Spanish rabbinic literature produced during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The result is an incisive examination of rab binic authors and their readers that highlights the importance of vernacular musar literature as a valuable and underutilized resource for the reconstruction of Ottoman Jewish culture. One of the signal contributions of this study is Lehman's success in bringing the central figures of Judeo-Spanish literature to an English audience. Though the treatises of Isaac Bekhor Amarachi, Joseph ben Meir Sason, and Eliezer Papo enjoyed great popularity in Sephardic reading groups (meldados) during the nine teenth century, they remain relatively unknown in the West, even to students of Jewish studies. Lehmann 's close reading of these important works and his deftness in situating the so-called vernacular rabbis and their readers in the discourse of modernization is a major step forward in the study of Sephardic intellectual culture. He illustrates how these authors helped to broaden the scope of traditional rabbinic musar to include secular knowledge while, at the same time, asserting the vitality and immutability ofthat tradition's core principles. The literary and didactic use of the Judeo-Spanish vernacular began in the eighteenth century, as authors such as Jacob Huli hoped it might combat popular ignorance of traditional rabbinic texts. By the late nineteenth century, the heresy of European secularism had become the chief target of this literature. Though Lehmann's book is more sociological than historical in tone, his lightly sketched chronology nonetheless helps to contexrualize and periodize Ottoman Jewry. The accent here is on cultural transformation rather than a break between traditional and modem, and Lehmann is careful to note that the progression of ideas in Ladino rabbinic literature over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was always complex and often incomplete. The book is divided into eleven chapters that are grouped into five parts. Lehmann covers an enormous amount of ground in short, compelling vignettes that touch on subjects such as language, genre, authors, and readers (themselves subdivided by region, class, and gender) and the overarching social context that this literature both reflects and helps to shape. In Part 1, Lehmann traces the foun dation of Ladino reading culture as the result of various historical factors, such as the parallel development of Ottoman printing and the decline of Hebrew literacy. He argues that Ottoman musar did not come in direct response to the moral and educational crisis caused by Sabbateanism, but rather the latter helped to spread Lurianic Kabbalah and a more inclusive educational ideal. In Parts 2 and 3, Lehmann details the way in which the rise of rabbinic litera ture in the Ladino vernacular had significant and long-ranging consequences for the democratization of Ottoman Jewry. One such development was the success of these rabbis in producing a new female reading public. Though this literature was initially 415</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews intended for a male readership, its popularity among Sephardi women forced its authors to alter their approach to traditional Jewish ethics in order to address the concerns and interests of this new audience. Along with the democratization of halakhic and musar literature came the expectation that more people would become active guardians of Jewish values. Thus, as rabbinic ideals were dissemi nated among an ever-widening readership, so, too, was the obligation to act and to police the actions of others. Lehmann argues that vernacular rabbis were more than willing to accept this degree of decentralization of social control in order to ensure the propagation of traditional Jewish ethics. The book's final two parts deal more explicitly with Sephardic intellectual responses to the challenges of a modem historical consciousness and scientific thought. On many issues, the vernacular rabbis adhered to a relatively conserva tive worldview. They did little to change the traditional valuation of exile as suffer ing or to modify the ahistorical and symbolic universe of the Talmud. On the contrary, they sought to neutralize modem historical thinking, as their predeces sors had sought to defuse messianic speculation, by emphasizing the timeless power of atonement and redemption. While admitting that the study of science held important lessons for their readership, authors such as Amarachi and Sason sought to underscore the general agreement of scientific principles with traditional rabbinic knowledge. They were careful to promote only those scientific and tech nological theories that were not in opposition to a traditional Jewish worldview. The attention paid to such secular knowledge thus affirmed the inclusive, pro gressive nature of traditional rabbinic Judaism. Throughout the book, Lehmann argues for the important bonds between the composers and consumers of Ladino literature. Ottoman rabbis possessed a keen awareness of their readership and its changing needs. In his comparison of the Hebrew and the Ladino editions of Eliezer Papo's Pele Yo 'ets, Lehmann notes that each one seems to address a different group, an elite and a popular audience, respectively. Their works were intended to help situate the reader within a highly symbolic conceptual universe that upheld traditional roles, values, and attitudes while making room for scientific concepts where possible. At times, however, Lehmann 's analysis of the intellectual agenda of these rabbis outstrips his ability to gauge their relative success. Clearly, such works were popular. Yet it remains less certain whether they ever became more than a bourgeois indulgence, merely marking time for a community that would ulti mately succumb to the demands of modernization. Lehmann is aware of parallel developments in Ottoman society in general, observing that both Jewish and non-Jewish society in the Empire witnessed a democratization of knowledge through the popular press in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nonetheless, his discussion of the vernacular rabbis might have benefited from some compari sons with their European counterparts. Many readers may wonder how promoting the stability of the traditional Talmudic universe differed in ideological content and social impact from similar movements among the Ashkenazim. Such criticisms are minor and, ultimately, reflect Lehmann's success in stir ring new interest in his subject. This wide-ranging and authoritative work argues convincingly that Ladino musar literature demands serious attention as both an 416</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews expression and a reflection of the modem Sephardic experience. Though the field of Ottoman Jewish culture has received increased attention in recent years, there remain very few full-length studies available in English. For this reason, and for the creativity and erudition with which it is written, this book is a welcome addition to the burgeoning field of Sephardic and Mizrahi studies, and it should appeal to anyone interested in the interplay between religion and culture in the modem world.
