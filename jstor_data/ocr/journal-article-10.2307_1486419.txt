<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES AND THOMAS AQUINAS: NATURAL OR DIVINE PROPHECY? by ALEXANDER ALTMANN Brandeis University The question whether prophecy is a natural phenomenon or a divine gift goes back to classical antiquity. A natural explanation of divination in sleep was first attempted by Democritus whose theory operates with the notion of 'images' (eidola) that affect the soul in dreams and foretell the future. Whence these images emanate does not seem to be too clear from the sources at our disposal.' Democritus is said to have described them as "great and gigantic . .. although not indestructible,"2 and from this we may, perhaps, infer that he associated the images with the statues of gods to which the ancients ascribed an odd assortment of capacities.3 The 'images' may therefore signify certain emanations from those statues, especially since Aristotle distinctly speaks of Democritus' theory as one involving 'images and emanations' that derive from certain objects.4 The theory thus under- 1.

Aristotle posed the question: What is the cause of veridical dreams?, and he inclined to assume that the veracity of at least some of them was due to mere 'coincidence' (sympt6mata).8 Yet he pressed the search further. It seemed unlikely to him that divinatory dreams were "sent by God" (theopempta) since it was not "the best and wisest" who enjoyed such dreams but ordinary people and particularly those whose nature was gar- rulous and melancholic.9 Being a scientist, he followed this clue and he reached the conclusion that there was a natural link between the easy response of such people to internal stimuli during sleep and their divinatory ability. He was able to develop this theory within the larger context of his theory of sleep as a state in which the senses were at rest and the bond (desmos) of rational thinking was also relaxed, thereby allowing for the free play of imagination. This syndrome-dormancy of senses and all controls on the one hand and uncontrolled activity of imagination on the other-was destined to become the archetypal pattern for practically all theories of divination and prophecy. The natural process thus described was said by Aristotle to be 'demonic', for "nature was demonic, not divine,"'0 the term "demonic" signifying, as in Plato, something intermediate between the human and the divine." 5.

Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, ed. 2</page><page sequence="3">NATURAL OR DIVINE PROPHECY? This scientific or naturalistic explanation of divination in sleep was a marked departure by Aristotle from the view he had expressed in his early work On Philosophy. "When the soul is by itself in sleep," he had said then, "it takes on its proper nature and prophesies and predicts the future. And it is in this state also when it is being separated from the body at the approach of death."'1 Echoes of this earlier view, which is characteristic of Aristotle's Platonic phase, are found also in his Eudemian Ethics, as Shlomo Pines has pointed out.'3 According to this Platonizing doctrine, the human soul is akin to the divine and for this reason may have intimations of things to come whenever untrammeled by the senses. Clearly, this view contains a theory that vindicates to the human soul a natural capacity for divination on account of its god-like nature, not because of physiological conditions. The probably most instructive documentation of the classical and early- Hellenistic discussion of the theme is found in Cicero's book On Divination which, as Isaac Heinemann has shown, draws in the main on Posidonius' work of the same title.'4 The Stoics took a position radically opposed to Aristotle's scientific approach in that they ascribed all divinatory phenomena to divine Providence. If there are gods who care about men, so the argument ran, there must be divination, a forewarning or cheering by prophetic dreams or in other ways.'5 There are two kinds of divination, natural and artificial, the natural type comprising veridical dreams and frenzy (mania, furor, raptus), the artificial signifying the interpretation of signs based on age-old empirical observation of sequences that correlates signs and events. The superiority of natural divination was recognized by Posidonius and Philo of Alexandria.16 Stoicizing Peripatetics like Isadore Twersky and George H. Williams [Cambridge, Mass., 1977], 2: 44-45, 49).

Cratippus in particular took issue with Aristotle's suggestion that the veracity of dreams might be purely coin- cidental, a view that had been adopted also by Carneades.17 He maintained the Stoic notion of veridical dreams as sent by a solicitous Providence and the Platonizing view of the divine nature of the human soul which had also become part of the Stoic doctrine.'8 In his view, therefore, prophecy was natural in the sense that the soul possessed a natural capacity for divination. As has been shown in an important study by Shlomo Pines,'9 the Arabic philosophers had no inkling of Aristotle's treatise On Divination in Sleep in its original and authentic form but knew it only in an Arabic version (now lost) which can be partly reconstructed from Averroes' Epitome of it20 and from some quotations found in the Risdla al-mandmiyya (presumably by Avicenna)2' and in Ibn Bajja's Tadbfr al-mutawahhid.22 According to this Arabic version, veridical dreams are bestowed by divine Providence, through the Active Intelligence, upon the human imagination which thereby receives the knowledge of future events either in clear terms ("as they are go- ing to be") or in a "hidden," i.e., figurized form.23 As in Cratippus, we find in this theory the assumption of divine origin combined with a naturalistic approach, seeing that both the activity of the Active Intelligence and the mimetic function of the imagination are natural as distinct from the divine initiative. It is this theory of veridical dreams which underlies the doctrines of prophecy developed by al-Farabi and Avicenna. It forms the starting point and structural nucleus of these more complex theories. Like veridical dreams, prophecy in its various higher forms is said to be due to an emana- tion from God mediated by the Active Intelligence, the difference being that 17.

Averroes, who elaborated the doctrine of veridical dreams in his Epitome of the Arabic version of Aristotle's treatise, made the explicit point that essentially there was no difference between veridical dreams and prophecy or for that matter between the two and technical forms of divination (kihdna). The only dif- ference was one of degree. For this reason it had been said that "dream was a certain part of prophecy." Averroes alluded here to a widely quoted and much varied hadith according to which Muhammad is said to have defined a dream as being the forty-sixth part of prophecy.24 In his Epitome Averroes also pointed out that veridical dreams were confined to disclosures of future happenings and to information in the practical arts such as medicine, many cures having been revealed in dreams, but could not convey knowledge in the theoretical sciences. Revelations of the latter kind, particularly about things divine, were possible only in prophecy.25 Maimonides was not acquainted with Averroes' Epitome, as we happen to know from the letter written by him to his disciple Yosef ben Shime'on in 1190-91.26 Yet his discussion of veridical dreams in Guide 2: 36 is strikingly similar to Averroes'. He too makes the point that there is only a difference in degree between dreams and prophecy, and one of the rabbinic dicta (Berakhot 57b) quoted by him in support ("dream is the sixtieth part of prophecy") is probably the source from which the hadtth cited by Averroes ultimately derived. In other chapters (2: 37, 38), he made it clear that prophets alone received intimations of a theoretical nature in addition to knowledge of future events but whether or not the medical art stood to profit from dreams is not spelled out by him. Gersonides took it for granted that he denied such a possibility and that his psychological explanation of misguided prophetic claims in 2: 38 was a veiled attack against Galen who had attributed some of his cures to revelation in dreams.27 We may safely as- 24.

It is this intellectual background that accounts in large measure for Maimonides' theory of prophecy. Thomas Aquinas' philosophical background was in many respects dif- ferent. He shared with Maimonides a knowledge, at least to some extent, of the Arabic philosophers, particularly of Avicenna.28 He was not acquainted, however, with the Arabic version of Aristotle's On Divination in Sleep, even assuming that he knew the Latin version of Averroes' Epitome of the Parva naturalia which was, in part, based on that version.29 This is evident from the fact that both he and his teacher Albertus Magnus quote the authentic Aristotelian view that veridical dreams cannot be sent by God, seeing that they do not occur to the wisest and best.30 Both Albert and he believed Aristotle to hold a purely naturalistic notion of veridical dreams, and this suited both of them very well. It enabled them to assign the phenomenon of prophecy as attested in pagan literature to purely natural agencies in con- trast to biblical prophecy which they attributed to the agency of God and designated as divine prophecy.3' There were more differences in the intellec- tual heritage of Maimonides and St. Thomas. Maimonides' knowledge of the philosophical tradition concerning theories of prophecy was limited to the works of the Arabic and a few Jewish philosophers, whereas Thomas, like Albert, had at his disposal a large array of Latin sources as well.32 Moreover, Thomas could draw on an extensive body of patristic writings, especially St. Augustine's Twelfth Book in De Genesi ad litteram that dealt with prophecy.33 Finally, both he and Albert were quite at home with 28.

Maimonides' treatment of the subject in the Guide and made ample use of it, as has been shown in a number of studies tracing his borrowings.34 It is remarkable that Thomas Aquinas could adopt a great many points from Maimonides' theory of prophecy, notwithstanding the radical dif- ference in their fundamental outlook which may be summed up in the an- tithesis between 'natural' and 'divine' prophecy that forms the subject of this paper. The ultimate reason for this difference must be sought in the dis- similarity of ontological assumptions that divide them. Maimonides sub- scribes to the Avicennian type of ontology35 which sees the total reality, in- cluding God, as a continuum in which the flow of emanations from God through the hierarchy of Intelligences reaches down to the Active Intel- ligence as the immediate fountainhead of the activity of forms in the sub- lunar world. This entire universe is a system of free-flowing grace as it were,36 and does not require special acts of divine grace for special purposes. Here grace is abounding at all times, and its reception and efficacy depend solely on the receptivity or disposition of the recipient. "Envy is banished from the celestial choir," Plato had said,37 and this statement is echoed in Avicenna's declaration, "Yonder there is no veiling (ihtijdb) nor avarice (bukhl),"38 a formulation that reappears somewhat abbreviated in Judah 34.

I borrow this term from H. A. Wolfson's translation of Maimonides' definition of prophecy (2: 36) as "a free grace flowing from God through the medium of the Active Intellect to man's rational faculty first and then to his imaginative faculty." As Wolfson explains, the term faid, which is usually translated as "emanation," actually denotes the "element of liberality and generosity in the act of emanation" and is correctly rendered by largitas in the old Latin translation (Paris, 1520). See Wolfson, "Hallevi and Maimonides on Prophecy," JQR, n.s. 33 (1943): 71 (republished in Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, 2 [1977]: 60-119; cf. p. 108). 37.

At the same time, the natural en- dowments of matter and of the material intellect of man, if properly con- ditioned, render the bestowal of the divine overflow a natural process. Maimonides says distinctly (2: 32) that "it is a natural thing for everyone who according to his natural disposition is fit for prophecy ... to become a prophet." True, he makes the actualization of the prophetic potentiality dependent upon the Divine Will that may or may not miraculously prevent it, but the "Divine Will"-designated here as mashi'a, not irdda-has to be understood as the primordial Will of God that is identical with God's Wisdom.41 Hence the gift of prophecy is not due to an ad hoc dispensation but is grounded in the ultimate mystery of the Divine essence in which Will and Wisdom are intertwined. Maimonides' stipulation that links prophecy to the Divine Will is not meant to annul its natural character; it only cor- roborates it. For the natural happening is thereby legitimized, as it were, as divinely preordained and as of an order above mechanical and blind neces- sity. Maimonides' insistence upon the operation of Will in the flow of emanations comes close to the way in which some modern interpreters have understood Plotinus' notion of emanation as a blend of necessity and will.42 It would therefore seem that even if Maimonides' stipulation meant to dis- guise his view-as some commentators assume it does43-his stress on the Divine Will does represent his true opinion and it allows, at the same time, for a naturalistic theory of prophecy.

Thomas interpreted the active intellect as a part of the human intellect.45 He adhered to the concept of Intelligences correlated to the celestial bodies but cancelled the emanationist theory and thereby did away with the notion of a divine continuum in which grace is a matter of free-flowing divine activity. In the Augustinian-Avicennian tradition the boundaries of grace and nature had been blurred. All cognition had been described as a seeing in the divine light. St. Thomas sharply differentiated between nature and grace. Gratia perficit naturam, which means that the two are not a single activity any more. Whereas in the al-Farabi-Avicenna type of epistemology the highest stage of human knowledge amounts to an act of mystical union with the Ac- tive Intelligence, and prophecy is this very act, termed variously the 'angelic intellect' or 'holy intellect' or 'holy spirit' or 'divine power',46 Thomas frees the cognitive act from any link with the transcendent. Hence for him prophecy cannot be a mere perfect act of the natural order of intellection. It becomes a pure 'gift of God' (donum Dei or donum Spiritus sancti).47 It is no longer the result of natural dispositions as in Maimonides. Nor can it ever be a habitus, since it is a transient gift, like light in the air.48 At best, it may 44. See Gallus M. Manser, Das Wesen des Thomismus, 3d ed.

He offers two definitions of natural prophecy. The first of these is based on Aristotle's notion of the 'natural' as "that which has the principle of motion within itself," e.g., it being natural for fire to rise upward.50 Those who hold the soul to be naturally gifted to foresee the future take the term 'natural' in this sense of 'natural power'.51 Yet this theory must be rejected, he says, for various reasons, chiefly because the human mind cannot naturally arrive at a cognition to which no way leads from self-evident principles of knowledge.52 The second definition of natural prophecy starts from the concept of 'natural' as a principle of dispositions or aptitudes insofar as these are the necessary preconditions for the attain- ment of certain perfections, e.g., the suitable disposition of the human body for the infusion of the rational soul.53 Natural prophecy in this sense of the term would seem to be identical with the al-Farabi-Avicenna-Maimonides sponsored view that makes prophecy dependent on natural dispositions for the reception of the divine overflow. St. Thomas adopts this kind of theory, without its emanationist implications, as an adequate explanation of veridical dreams and natural prophecy. He rules it out of court as far as true prophecy-the one "about which we talk"-is concerned.54 He believes that in the case of veridical dreams the natural aptitude or disposition enables the dreamer to receive certain 'impressions' from the celestial bodies in which the 'preparations' of future events reside. The soul, by virtue of its subtlety, is able to previsualize those events from certain 'similitudes' left in the imagination as a result of those impressions.55 This theory goes back to Avicenna who attributes to the celestial bodies an influence upon the imagination of suitably disposed people, without, however, attaching too much significance to dreams produced in this manner.56 St. Thomas ob- 49.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that in his view the celestial bodies are responsible for sublunar happenings that are not reducible to the elemental powers, including such occult phenomena as magnetism.57 As far as natural prophecy is concerned, St. Thomas believes it to consist in the reception of certain information from the Intelligences which, unlike Maimonides, he does not equate with the angels.58 He makes the point, however, that even information conveyed by the angels is still within the confines of natural prophecy.59 This theory of natural prophecy clearly follows the Maimonidean pattern but relegates it to a lower level. Defined in the most concise formulation offered by Thomas, natural prophecy is one "ex virtute creata."60 This includes both intelligences and angels. It is obvious that divine prophecy, according to St. Thomas, can do without the dispositions which Maimonides laid down as conditional for the coming-into-being of prophecy.61 If prophecy is but a gift of God, it will be unnecessary for the prophet to be endowed with a high degree of imagina- tion and intellectual capacity, to have developed his mental powers through training, and to be possessed of moral perfection. All these preconditions were required by Maimonides under the assumption that only the most favorable preparation of'matter' rendered an individual fit for the reception of the divine emanation, i.e., for union with the Active Intelligence. More specifically, only at the stage of the acquired intellect could the divine influx assume such proportions as to set in motion the rational faculty as well as the imagination in adequate measure. On the one hand, Thomas adopts the phenomenology of the prophetic process described by Maimonides also for divine prophecy. He actually quotes Maimonides when referring to this process: "Prophecy begins in the intellect and is completed in the imagination."62 For "from the fullness of the intellectual light a redundancy arises that spills over into imagination there to form an imaginative vision."63 57.

II</page><page sequence="12">ALEXANDER ALTMANN Yet in discussing the question "Whether any natural disposition is re- quired for prophecy,"64 Thomas points out that as a divine gift prophecy cannot be due to any natural cause (ex virtute alicuius causae creatae). At times God confers this gift precisely upon the seemingly most unfit in order thereby to indicate the operation of divine power.65 Hence prophecy cannot be something merited by certain perfections. It is all a matter of unmerited grace.66 In thus divorcing the gift of prophecy from all natural dispositions, Thomas Aquinas subscribes to the very view which Maimonides (2: 32) had listed as the opinion of the ignorant multitude among pagans and Jews, i.e., the one that held prophecy to be independent of natural capacities and that considered it purely a matter of Divine Will. At the same time Thomas does not deny that dispositional qualities are indeed needed to make the divine gift of prophecy operational. He therefore assumes that God, who is the creator of both form and matter, supplies not only the lumen propheticum but also the necessary disposition in case it is lacking. Thus, in the absence of a sufficiently strong power of imagination God will ameliorate the com- plexion of the organ that is responsible for the imaginative faculty.67 This is an interesting case of combining Maimonides' phenomenology of the prophetic act with the exigencies of a supernaturalistic view of prophecy. The naturalistic point of view remains intact but it is integrated into a super- naturalistic framework. Divine grace creates the natural conditions for the effective reception of the charisma. What is meant by this kind of divine intervention becomes clear from Thomas' discussion of the role of angels in prophecy, another topos that bears some resemblance to Maimonides' doctrine. Before entering into this area of discussion, let us first present Thomas' important and fundamental distinction between two aspects of the prophetic act which he calls acceptio (or receptio) and iudicium.68 As Benoit Garceau has shown in his monograph on the subject,69 these two terms signify, in this context at least, the imaginative vision on the one hand and its intellectual interpretation or meaning on the other. In a sense, acceptio and iudicium correspond to the 64. QD, 12. 4, p. 245a. 65. Ibid. (ad 6), p. 245b. 66. Ibid. (ad 4). 67. Ibid. (2), p. 244b. 68.

Thomas Aquinas points out that the mere reception of an image in dream or vision does not make one a prophet. Pharaoh's dream vision did not amount to prophecy. Joseph, who received a iudicium, an intellectual understanding, of Pharaoh's dream, did thereby show himself to be a prophet. A fortiori, one who has both the receptio of a species or similitude and the intellectual iudicium concerning it is a prophet. He is the most superior prophet whose very receptio consists of an intellec- tual vision (unalloyed by imaginative components) as well as a divinely im- parted iudicium.7' It is not difficult to recognize in this tripartite division the contours of Maimonides' three levels of prophecy, the lowest being purely imaginative (as in veridical dreams); the intermediate combining imaginative and intellectual cognition; and the highest involving the intellect alone (as in Moses' prophecy).72 70. See H. A. Wolfson, "The Terms Ta$awwur and Tasdiq in Arabic Philosophy and Their Greek, Latin and Hebrew Equivalents," Moslem World 33 (1943): 1-15 (republished in Studies, 1: 478-92; cf. 2: 564-65). 71. QD, 12. 7 and 12. 12; ST, 174. 2-3. 72. Thomas's view derives, in the first place, from Augustine's. See De genesi, 12. 9 (Prophetiam ad mentem pertinere). As for the lowest level of prophecy, there is an echo of Maimonides' description of veridical dreams (2: 36) as novelet nevu'ah, a term quoted from Genesis Rabba, 17: 5, 44: 17. Thomas (ST, 173. 2) refers undoubtedly to this term when he says that mere imaginative apparitions are "called by some casus prophetiae" (this being the correct reading in place of extasis prophetiae, which makes no sense). The reference becomes perfectly clear from a passage in Albertus Magnus, De somno et vigilia, 3. 1. 3, p. 181: "propter quod tradiderunt Philosophi, quod somnium aliquod futurum praenuntians est casus a prophetia factus. Casus enim vocatur immaturus fructus decidens, qui tamen figuram et saporem fructus etiam aliquo modo praetendit." Manuel Joel, Verhdltnis Albert des Grossen zu Moses Maimonides (Breslau, 1863; 2d ed. 1876, here quoted), p. 25, first drew attention to the use in this passage (in the name of the 'philosophers') of Maimonides' quotation and interpretation of the midrashic phrase, casus being obviously the rendition of novelet (i.e., the fruit 'falling' prematurely off the tree) in the Latin version by Augustinus Iustinianus which was based on Judah al-Harizi's Hebrew translation (see W. Kluxen, "Literargeschichtliches zum lateinischen Moses Maimonides," in Recherches de theologie ancienne et medievale 21 (1954): 23-50). Joel did not verify his assumption but the Paris 1520 edition of the old Latin version (reprint ed., Frankfurt, 1964), fol. 63b does indeed contain this term: Dixit etiam in eadem ratione quod casus prophetiae somnium est. Johannes Buxtorfjun. (Doctor Perplexorum, [Basle, 1629], p. 293) renders the midrashic statement: "Deciduum Prophetiae est Somnium." Cf. Jacob Gutt- mann, Die Scholastik des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts (Breslau, 1902), pp. 113-14. The dependence of the Thomas Aquinas passage on Maimonides was definitively established by Joseph Mausbach (see n. 34), p. 563, n. 1 by suggesting the reading 'casus' (following the note in the Bar-le-Duc edition). Jose M. Casciaro (see n. 34), pp. 165-66 adopts Mausbach's reading.</page><page sequence="14">ALEXANDER ALTMANN Thomas Aquinas describes the acceptio supernaturalis, i.e., the divinely caused reception of some vision, as nova formatio specierum, i.e., as a new formation of images or similitudes, it being new either as signifying something not previously contained in the imagination, or as a novel com- bination of previously held images.73 The formation of images he attributes to the activity of the angels in the sense that it is the angels' job to move the imagination. This assumption, he explains, follows from St. Augustine's and Dionysius' doctrine that all created corporeal nature is administered by created spiritual natures.74 In light of this statement we may assume that the furnishing by God of the requisite quality of the imagination whenever necessary is to be understood as part of the angelic function. As for the iudicium supernaturale, he characterizes it as an 'infused light' (lumen in- fusum) or as an 'illumination of the mind' (mentis illustratio), a terminology somewhat reminiscent of the Maimonidean definition of prophecy as an 'overflow' (faid) from God through the Active Intelligence upon intellect and imagination. Thomas Aquinas must, however, not be understood as reverting to an emanationist position. He certainly does not consider the in- fused light to flow from God by way of the Active Intelligence; yet there re- main certain ambiguities. On the one hand, he describes the lumen infusum in terms of its function, which is the 'strengthening' or 'preparation' of the human mind for the reception of the lumen propheticum.75 On the other hand, he defines it as a process by which the lumen divinum, something utter- ly simple and universal, is communicated to the human mind. The lumen in- fusum is the filtering as it were of the incomprehensible divine light by way of the angelic intellect. By passing through the angelic intellect the divine light is somehow 'contracted' and 'specified' and thereby accommodated to the prophetic intellect.76 One is reminded of the kabbalistic doctrine of 'contraction' (simsum) which serves a somewhat similar purpose. It follows that in the doctrine of St. Thomas the supernatural act of prophetic illumination is not as direct and immediate as one might have as- sumed from its definition as donum Dei. It turns out to be an act mediated by angelic activity, not entirely unlike the view held by Maimonides. The revelation of prophecy, St. Thomas says, "descends from God to an angel, and from the angel to man."77 Maimonides, too, describes all prophecy, 73. QD, 12. 8, p. 253a. 74.

In all other respects the analogy breaks down. In Maimonides' doctrine the angels that are said to mediate prophecy are, as a rule, the imaginative faculty of each prophet, the term 'cherub' being used to denote the intellect.78 Thomas Aquinas does not accept Maimonides' designation of natural faculties or propensities as 'angels'.79 Nor does he agree that the angels seen in prophetic dreams and visions are mere projec- tions of the imagination. According to Maimonides, the 'created forms' which the prophet visualizes are but forms 'created' by the imagination,80 and they include the forms of angels and men. In St. Thomas' view, the role of angels in prophecy is of a metaphysical, not merely psychological, order. Their role is confined, however, to a subsidiary function, while the initiative and the content of the prophetic gift remain the preserve of God. Were angels to communicate to men any knowledge they possess on their own, without divine revelation as its source, the prophecy thus constituted would come under the rubric of natural, not divine, prophecy.81 Maimonides emphatically differentiates between Moses' prophecy and that of all other prophets. He goes so far as to say that the term 'prophet' as used with reference to Moses and to the others is 'amphibolous' (bi- tashklk).82 We take the term 'amphibolous' to be used here in the sense of 'analogical'.83 This implies a relationship between exemplar and copy, and allows for both distance and proximity between Moses and the rest of the prophets. Moses is the "master of the prophets" and, at the same time, he shares with them the general characteristics of all prophecy, i.e., the naturalness of the prophetic act within the metaphysical continuum of a uni- verse in which divine grace abounds and is freely available to all according 78. See Guide, 2: 45 in fine; 2: 6 (Munk 17b-18a). The 'separate intellects' that are said to appear to the prophets (ibid., Munk 16b) are figurized in corporeal form by the imagination (1: 49, 2: 41-42), which is the mediating agency par excellence in all prophecies, except Moses'. 79. See Jacob Guttmann, Das Verhaltnis ..., pp. 73-75. 80. Guide, 1: 46 (Munk 52b). Zvi Diesendruck, "Maimonides' Lehre von der Prophetie," in Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams (New York, 1927), pp. 124ff., interpreted this pas- sage in the sense of prophecy being a divine creation. This view cannot be upheld. 81. See n. 59. 82. Guide, 2: 35. On the various shades of meaning of this term see H. A.

It has been suggested that, according to Maimonides, Moses' prophecy involved a direct bestowal of the prophetic gift by God, without mediation by secondary causes such as the Active Intelligence.84 This view cannot be upheld. Even Moses, it would seem, received his prophecy through the Active Intelligence. That this is Maimonides' view can be substantiated from a close reading of the way in which he interprets the biblical passages describing the uniqueness of Moses' prophecy. God spoke to him "mouth to mouth" (Numbers 12:8) is paraphrased: "The mighty divine overflow reached him" (2: 24), i.e., he received an abundant measure of the divine emanation that passes through the Active Intelligence. "Whom the Lord knew face to face" (Deuteronomy 34:10): "His apprehension was different from that of all who came after him" (2: 35). "And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face" (Exodus 33:11) is said to mean: "as a presence to another presence, without an in- termediary"; for "the hearing of a speech without the intermediacy of an angel is described as 'face to face"' (1: 37). In plain words: "The imaginative faculty did not enter into his prophecy, since the intellect overflowed toward him without the former's intermediation; for ... he did not, like the other prophets, prophesy by means of parables" (2: 37). It is the purely intellec- tual nature of Moses' prophecy that alone is held to justify the striking figures of speech used to characterize his supreme rank. St. Thomas clearly reflects Maimonides' view when he describes Moses' purely intellectual vision as an infusion of the divine light without angelic help.85 He makes the point, however, that even at this level of prophecy imagination is used, if only for the benefit of the multitude, while the prophet himself has no need for the figurization of the truth apprehended by him.86 Al-Farabi had expressed the same view when he said that the figurative language used by the Lawgiver-Prophet is invented "not in order to understand [for] himself the higher realities ... but as symbols and images for others."87 Maimonides could not have held otherwise since he was acutely aware of the need to interpret the figurative language of the Torah. His reference to Moses' faculty of imagination (2: 36) makes sense from this point of view.88 The essential difference between Maimonides and 84. H. A.

For a different interpretation see Kaspi, ad loc. 16</page><page sequence="17">NATURAL OR DIVINE PROPHECY? Thomas is here, as elsewhere, the difference between natural and divine prophecy. In Maimonides' view even Moses' prophecy was the natural result of a specific disposition which, though unique, was still natural. The highest possible degree of perfection that is natural to the human species, he says, must necessarily be realized in at least one particular individual (2: 32). Moses was that individual. Hence, Moses is no exception to the general rule that prophecy is a natural phenomenon within a divinely controlled uni- verse. Maimonides' portrayal of Moses' spirituality in Guide 3: 51 makes it evident that he considered the attainment of his exceptional rank to have been the natural result of his dispositions and mode of life. We might say that his union with the Active Intelligence was held to have been consequent upon his decorporealization as it were, a stage reminiscent of ibn Bajja's ultimate stage that arises from an existential break with matter.89 We may also call it the achievement of merited grace. St. Thomas, on the other hand, sees Moses' prophecy as the ultimate degree of divine prophecy in the sense of unmerited grace.90 One final point. Avicenna had suggested that Providence which took such care of the comforts of the human race as to provide men with eyelashes and concave soles could not have left him without making provi- sion for politically gifted men that would take care of law and order, thereby securing the survival of the species. For, as Aristotle had said,9' man was 'political by nature', i.e., in dire need of political organization.92 In taking up this theme Maimonides pointed out that the striking social divisiveness due to differences in character between men required the authority of rulers and lawgivers in order to neutralize the 'natural diversity' by the imposition of 'conventional accord'. In this way, "the law, although it is not nature, enters into what is natural" (2: 40). In other words, convention is designed 89. See Alexander Altmann, "Ibn Bajja on Man's Ultimate Felicity," Harry Austryn Wolfson Jubilee Volume (Jerusalem, 1965), 1: 74 and passim (republished in Alexander Alt- mann, Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism [Ithaca, N.Y. and London, 1969], p. 96 and passim). 90.

It can be shown that the manner in which the Arabic philosophers and Maimonides elaborate the statement presupposes some knowledge of its use in the Politics, not merely in the Ethics.

It is tacitly assumed that only the prophet, not the philosopher, is capable of effectively imposing a unifying law upon a na- tion or group of people. The prophet is thus seen as a necessity of nature, a view that inevitably implies that prophecy is a natural phenomenon. This is, at any rate, St. Thomas' reading of the Avicennian thesis according to which prophets are indispensable for the preservation of humanity. Thomas lists this viewpoint as one of the nineteen arguments adduced by him in favor of the naturalistic approach to prophecy.93 He quotes as a scriptural prooftext Proverbs 29:18: "Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint," in- terpreting 'vision' as the exercise of the prophetic office. He may have hit upon this particular verse by his own intuition, and it is interesting to note that Gersonides, in his Commentary on Proverbs, explains it in the very same way. Thomas rejects Avicenna's argument. The sociopolitical order, he says, will be taken care of with or without prophets. Nature will be responsible for the satisfaction of man's need. The prophet is not a necessity of nature. He is required to give direction toward life eternal, not to secure justice in the political order. The supernatural goal is attainable through the 'justice of faith' of which prophecy is the principle.94 Thomas has nothing further to say, in this context at least, on the political function of prophecy, a theme of tremendous significance to Maimonides who sees in the Law of the Torah the perfect constitution of the ideal city.95 St. Thomas' silence on the political function of prophecy-to be more precise: his denial of such a function-set him apart from the entire school of thought, Islamic and Jewish, that ranged itself with the Platonic search for the 'ideal city' on earth. In developing that tradition, the faldsifa and their Jewish partisans, including Maimonides, had good reason for stressing the role of imagination in prophecy. It was the political function of the prophet that necessitated the veiling of metaphysical notions by figuriza- tion. By radically ignoring the political aspect, St. Thomas deprived himself of the means of suggesting a cogent rationale for the significance of the imaginative element in prophecy. On the one hand, he fully subscribed to the interpretation of the prophetic act as one involving the imagination. On the other, he had little to offer in explanation of this theory beyond the general observation that truth was hard of access to the multitude.96 Yet the 93.

Albertus Magnus had quoted the Greek poet Simonides who suggested that it was the envy of the gods that caused their revelations to be veiled in figurative language.97 A decisive step toward a more appreciative evaluation was taken when the mimetic function of imagination in the service of the intellect was discovered, probably in Middle Platonism.98 In the Arabic version of Aristotle's On Divination in Sleep9 this new insight already plays some part, if only a minor one. Final- ly, al-Farabi put it into the service of the political interpretation of prophecy, and Maimonides took it from there. Yet how sensitive an area this was may be gauged from the fact not hitherto observed, that when listing the required dispositions of prophecy in his popular writings, Maimonides mentioned only intellectual and moral perfection but omitted imagination. He obviously considered it imprudent to disclose this par- ticular requirement to the very audience that was to benefit from the veiling of the truth. To what extent Maimonides adopted the political view of prophecy and in what manner he modified it to suit his own purposes is another matter. There is, however, enough evidence to show that the adop- tion of this viewpoint reinforced his naturalistic concept of prophecy, while the rejection of it in St. Thomas was part and parcel of his supernaturalistic doctrine. 97.
