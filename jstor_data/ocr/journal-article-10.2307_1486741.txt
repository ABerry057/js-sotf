<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eli Davis and David A. Frenkel. The Hebrew Amulet: Biblical-Medical- General. Jerusalem: Institute for Jewish Studies, 1995. xvii, 212 pp. (Hebrew). This is at one and the same time a very valuable and a very frustrating book. On the one hand, Eli Davis and David Frenkel bring together a wealth of material on Jewish amulets from all over the Diaspora (from Afghanistan to the United States, with the majority of Iranian and North African provenance) and supplement the classic studies of T. Schrire and J. Trachtenberg, both of which require updating.' On the other hand, the book's organization, or rather its lack thereof, makes it difficult for even the most determined reader</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 123 to follow and to coordinate the items discussed in the text with the numerous, but random illustrations. The book is in part an academic monograph and in part a catalogue-not an unusual combination in art history and material culture publications. The seven brief chapters in the first part (pp. 1-60) deal with various aspects of the general subject of Hebrew amulets, while the second part catalogues some 350 items, mainly from the private collection of Davis, a distinguished physician at the Hebrew University and Hadassah Medical Center, and a noted and erudite collector of Judaica, who has published other works on genres of traditional material culture, often based on his own collection.2 The second-largest grouping in the catalogue is from the collection of the Glazer Institute for the History of Medicine in Jerusalem (nos. 313-342). The remaining eight items are from various collections belonging to institutions and individuals, all in Jerusalem. Rarely do the discussions of amulets in Part I refer the reader to illustrations in Part II. For example, in chapter 1, which provides a succinct introduction to the subject of amulets, their types, usages, and sources, not once is the reader told which items in the collection represent love amulets, birthing amulets, circumcision amulets, gender-specific amulets, etc. To make things still more confusing, where there are, in the succeeding chapters, references to items in the collection, the text refers readers to a numbered illustration (temuna mispar ...). But more often than not, no such illustration can be located. The perceptive reader will eventually figure out that each item number described in the catalogue section is called "illustration number," whether it is in fact illustrated or not. But even this is not entirely consistent, and sometimes the reader is referred only to an item number, which may or may not be among the illustrations. The reader who tries to identify any of the illustrations must refer back to the catalogue descriptions, since no captions other than number are provided. This reviewer got the distinct impression that there was no real editorial oversight in the production of this book. There is considerable and unnecessary repetition of details throughout the text. For example, on p. 3, the statement that amulets could be used to cure various illnesses which today we refer to as psychosomatic, such as migraines, colitis, and eczema, is repeated almost verbatim at the top and bottom of the page. Chapter 6 which deals with amulets listed in the Sefer Shoshan Yesod ha-'Olam of the sixteenth-century 2.

Joseph Tirshom, though highly interesting, seems to stand by itself with no direct connection to what precedes or follows it. Despite the annoying format, there is much that is highly useful in this book. The lengthy list of abbreviations commonly found on Hebrew amulets, the detailed elaboration of texts, gematriyot, and iconographic symbols, are all welcome tools for the interpretation and elucidation of talismans. There is also valuable information on the functional use of specific materials (e.g., marble against the evil eye, amber for fertility, cat's eye against bewitchment, crystal against toothache) and on the place of amulets in folk medicine. Finally, and no less important for the researcher, the book offers a descriptive guide to the largest single Hebrew amulet collection. The only other catalogued amulet collection of similar size (317 items) known to this reviewer is the Feuchtwanger collection, now in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.3 Yedida K.
