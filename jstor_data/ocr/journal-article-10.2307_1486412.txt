<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE AND THE SUBVERSION OF THE MARTYROLOGICAL IDEAL by ALAN MINTZ The developments triggered or accelerated by the anti-Jewish pogroms of 1881-1882 in Russia form a panorama of East European Jewish history at the end of the century: Zionism, the Bund, mass emigration and mass pauperization. The role of Hebrew literature in responding to these pogroms as well as to the later round of violence between 1903 and 1905 is significant for two reasons. In its own setting, Hebrew literature is crucial to an analysis of the consciousness of the period because it represents the response of an important segment of the intelligentsia of Russian Jewry, namely, those who associated themselves with national revival and its cultural medium, Hebrew. Hebrew fiction and poetry on the pogroms are also significant when studied in a vertical perspective, that is, in relationship to an evolved and elaborate set of traditions of response to catastrophe in Hebrew sources from the Bible and midrash through the piyyutim, chronicles, and consola- tion texts of the Middle Ages. Hebrew writing between 1881 and 1905 both partakes of that tradition and rebels against it, and in so doing reconstitutes the tradition; and it is that new tradition which must be confronted, evaded, or subverted when the literary imagination faces the more destructive pogroms of the World War I period and later the Holocaust itself. The situation of Hebrew literature is characterized by a split between a reversion to traditional models in times of crisis and an indictment of that 263</page><page sequence="2">264 ALAN MINTZ reflex. The immediate and preponderant response in the world of Hebrew letters was traditional. Paradigmatic of this tendency is the figure of Moses Leib Lilienblum and the famous description in his autobiography of the crumbling of his faith in the Haskalah and the possibility of Jewish self- improvement within Russian society as he witnessed the outbreaks of violence and his subsequent embrace of the Jewish nationalist cause.' The Hebrew poetry writers bypassed the modern period and reached into the past in search of models of discourse appropriate to the new historical con- sciousness. The biblical traditions of lamentation and consolation filled this need. As with the prophets, the attitude toward Israel reversed itself upon the destruction. From having been the object of didactic and ennobling preachments, Israel allegorized suddenly became the subject of mercy and solicitude. The pattern of this literature of consolation is evident in these lines from a well known poem of 1882 by Judah Loeb Gordon, the pre- eminent poet of the Haskalah. Why do you sob, my sister Ruhamah? Why are you downcast, why is your spirit agitated? Because plunderers have fallen upon your honor and profaned it? If the fist has triumphed, the hand of the enemy grown mighty, Can the blame be yours, my sister Ruhamah?2 There could be no more traditional move than to personify Israel as a weep- ing, battered woman victimized by a brutal enemy. Ruhamah, an allusion to Hosea 2:3, means "the pitied one"; the consolation the poet offers is the assurance that responsibility lies not with her but with the bloodthirstiness of the enemy. Later in the poem he offers further promise of future relief, which for Gordon, unlike more nationalist contemporaries, will come in the form of emigration to America. The same high biblical diction, the same extravagant pathos, and the same invective against the oppressor are the basic mode for such other writers of pogrom poetry as M. M. Dolitzky and Judah Leib Levin. An exemplary figure and the author of the most popular verses on the subject was Simon Frug, a russified Jewish poet who began writing in Russian but after the pogroms became a Yiddish poet and Jewish 1.

The distinctively biblical mold in which the subject of the pogroms was cast was the result of the conventions of Haskalah poetry and its linguistic ideals. In the wider literary culture of the 1880s and 1890s, it was the Middle Ages that were pushed to the center of consciousness. The ground was pre- pared by the rediscovery in Jewish historiography of the martyrological documents of the Middle Ages. Between 1887 and 1889 Hayyim Jonah Gurland, the government rabbi of Odessa, issued a vast compendium of annotated materials from the massacres of 1648: chronicles, piyyutim, let- ters, eulogies, prayers.4 In 1892 Adolf Neubauer, the reader in Rabbinic Hebrew at Oxford, brought out an edition of Hebrew historiographical texts, among which were the powerful and affecting chronicles from the First Crusade, hitherto unpublished.5 H. Graetz's massive Geschichte, which functioned in Hebrew literature like a great nineteenth-century historical novel and spoke eloquently of the epic of Jewish suffering, was translated into Hebrew by S. P. Rabbinowitz between 1890 and 1899,6 and in 1899 Solomon Buber published his critical edition of Lamentations Rabbah.7 The conception of Jewish history as a movement toward emancipation had now to accommodate the older notion of the recurrent, periodic victimization of the Jews at the hands of implacable enemies. The medievalization of Jewish literary consciousness, however, was not universal. The texts of three major writers of the period-Abramowitsch, Tchernichowsky, and Bialik-constitute an investigation and a subversion of the reversion to martyrological models. It is this response to a response that forms the subject of this paper. The counterstatement is more signifi- cant for literary history than the norm in this case because the dissenting texts are high art while the medievalizing texts are not, and because it was these writings, especially Bialik's, which constituted the norm which in turn exercised a great impact upon the response-or lack of it-to the Holocaust in contemporary Hebrew literature. 3.

The greatest prose writer of the time, Shalom Jacob Abramowitsch (known by the name of his narrative persona, Mendele Mokher Seforim) had founded his fictional enterprise upon a profound critique of the central institutions of Jewish society in the Pale: marriage as a commercial transaction, rampant overpopulation, sen- sualism and verbality as substitutes for power and politics, scholasticism and ignorance of the natural sciences, inhumanity in class relations-in short, his critique embraced the entire Haskalah program for reform, though with none of the Haskalah's blithe confidence in the inevitability of reform. By the time of the pogroms in 1881 the contours of Abramowitsch's fictional world were already well defined and the early versions of the major works were already written. To ask how Abramowitsch responded to the pogroms, then, is to ask how a fully formed major writer is affected by a great change in the fortunes of the reality about which he writes. This is not an easy question to answer on technical grounds because of the instability of Abramowitsch's textual production. He was hardly the kind of author who would write a book, publish it, and go on to the next; rather, he maintained throughout his career three or four major projects that he was continually expanding and revising, while shifting back and forth between Hebrew and Yiddish. Fortunately, there is a datable and unilingual group of short stories that Abramowitsch wrote in the 1880s and 1890s, in Hebrew, which can serve as a stable point of reference. In the 1886-1887 story "Be-seter ra'am" ("Secret Thunder"), set in the Mendelean town of Kabtsiel, Abramowitsch declares himself unambiguous- ly as to which options in the representation of the pogroms he declines to take. Like the hero of Walter Scott's Waverly, the Mendele figure in the story is comically unconscious for the duration of the pogrom in Kabtsiel, and since the tale is told from his point of view, the sensationalist account we most expect to be at the story's center is simply not there. The narrator justifies the omission by explaining that the events have already been well described in the "'Book of Lamentations for Kabtsiel,' attributed to one of the troop of noisy threnodists who appeared like mushrooms after the rain in the Hebrew periodical press at the time of the outrages."' The reference is to nothing other than the high biblical pathos of Gordon, Frug, Dolitzky, and Levin, or at least their local imitators, the authors of innumerable 8. Kol kitvei Mendele Mokher Sefarim (Tel Aviv, 1958), p. 384.</page><page sequence="5">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 267 chronicles and elegies for particular pogroms. Mendele treats us to a sample from the fictitious "Lament for Kabtsiel." Woe! Ennobling houses were laid waste on the day of reproach, and tens of thousands of our brethren Israel were ruined. Those raised to the purple in palaces of delight were left naked; hungry and thirsty they wandered in the streets.9 Mendele proceeds to poke fun at these epic hyperboles. Kabtsiel, to begin with, is in truth a tiny place with a small population. There are no substan- tial structures, not to mention "palaces of delight," with the exception per- haps of the rickety one-story tax house in the marketplace. Far from being the sons and daughters of the nobility, the Kabtsielites lead a threadbare existence, and most of them have no apparent source of income; they have no property and their few valuables are pawned weekly to make Sabbath expenses. In comparing the rhetoric with the reality, Abramowitsch is not taking away from the seriousness of the pogroms and their impact; he is deriding the conventional literary response to them. A national literature that makes no discriminations and absorbs every negative event into the rhetoric of absolute catastrophe, that rushes to idealize and beatify what was destroyed, that takes off into the heavens of inflated ornamental lan- guage-this is not a national literature that well serves the nation. The critical question of whether the pogroms can be or should be absorbed into the rituals of perennial catastrophe is raised by Abramowitsch in a story of ten years later, "Ha-Nisrafim" (1897).10 Nisrafim are a class of beggars, people supposedly made homeless by fire, who, on the strength of their misfortune and of letters of attestation to that effect, wander from settlement to settlement seeking alms. The premise of the tale is that Mendele, in his travels through the countryside as a bookpeddler, encounters an immense caravan of beggars, who turn out to be the entire vil- lage of Kabtsiel, Mendele's hometown, taken to the road as nisrafim. The theme of the story is the fundamental change Mendele undergoes in his atti- tude toward his townspeople in the very process of making inquiries about-and making fun of-their fate. Before meeting up with the caravan, the narrator, Mendele, sets the mock-epic tone of the first half of the story by stating that the event he is 9. Ibid., p. 384. 10. Ibid., pp. 444-48.</page><page sequence="6">268 ALAN MINTZ about to recount occurred in the first year after the great fire in the commu- nity of Kabtsiel. He goes on to explain: The fire was inscribed in the register of the community, and by it the Kabtsielites began to measure time. They would say, for example: the birth of X, the marriage of Y, in year such-in-such to the Fire; the decree of the yar- mulkes, the decree concerning the licensing of melamdim, the polluting and purifying of the putrid mikveh and river in the year such-and-such to the Fire. There are still old men and women alive from the time of the Fire, and when they used to tell of it sitting around the stove in the study house at dusk the young people would thirstily drink in their words and their eyes would glisten with tears.'' The epic reference that serves as the basis for the mock-epic structure in this passage is, of course, the Destruction of the Temple. Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews reckoned time both from the creation of the world and from the Destruction of the Temple. Through this linkage the pogrom in Kabtsiel is exalted to the heights of classic catastrophe and made the kind of founding, orientating event that demarcates the great epochs of history. In the cata- logue of chronicled events that comes next the mock-epic space between the Destruction and the pogrom in Kabtsiel is at first not felt; it is natural, after all, for births and deaths and the like to be related to an important event in the life of a community. The gap becomes evident and then widens as the catalogue proceeds to list the anti-Jewish measures (parallel to the May Laws) that followed the pogrom. A decree concerning head coverings does not strike a note of great seriousness, and neither does a government requirement that melamdim be certified as competent to teach. The indict- ment of the heder system was one of the central planks in the Haskalah program, especially the profession of elementary teaching, which often served as the last refuge for the ineffectual and the ruined. The level of deri- sion rises when the causes of an epidemic of infant death are superstitiously ascribed to sin rather than to the outrageous but tolerated sanitary condi- tions that prevail in the town. Instead of provoking the Kabtsielites to take stock of their situation and perhaps mobilize to alter it, the trauma of the pogrom has been domesticated, dissolved into talk, and absorbed into the comfortable glow of oral tradition. Once a terrible actuality, the pogrom has become, like the Destruction of the Temple itself, the stuff of hallowed myth. I11. Ibid., p. 444.</page><page sequence="7">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 269 When Mendele comes face-to-face with the Kabtsielites they are bewail- ing their fate with verses from Lamentations, sighing over the destruction of Kabtsiel visited upon them by God for their many sins. Confronted with the histrionics of high catastrophe and high mourning, Mendele probes a bit into the mundane specifics of the disaster. He discovers that this divinely dispatched conflagration actually began because of the negligence of one Naphtali, through whose uncleaned chimney sparks flew up and ignited a straw roof; because the houses of Kabtsiel are built one atop the other, the fire spread in a flash, and because Kabtsiel had never bothered to establish a fire brigade, nothing could be saved. The actual damage, it turns out upon further investigation, was not extensive; there were only a few real houses in Kabtsiel to be destroyed. But given the nonproductive occupa- tional structure of the town, the ruin of these few householders spelled ruin for the many dependent upon them: the tenants who rented from them, the shopkeepers who sold to them, the melamdim who taught their children, the scribes who wrote mezuzot for their doors, and the dozen varieties of reli- gious functionaries, the kelei qodesh, who eked out a living from their alms. So here they are, moaning, complaining, divided against themselves, an entire community pauperized and taken to the road. The play on the self-deluding airs of the Kabtsielites, on their negli- gence, on their passivity paraded as pious trust in Providence, the satire on the flimsy vacuity at the heart of the community's economic existence, the deflationary parody of such classical Hebrew texts as Lamentations-this first half of "Ha-Nisrafim" is topflight, classic Abramowitsch. It could have been lifted from an Abramowitsch text from thirty years earlier; its comic method remains unaffected by the dire contemporary historical matters it reflects on. This is doubly true in the case of the attitude of the Mendele figure toward his people: surely not contempt but a grinning, bantering irony that verges on derision. The second half of "Ha-Nisrafim," however, is quite different, and the difference is entirely a matter of a shift in Mendele's stance. The situation of the Kabtsielites does not change, but his stance toward them changes considerably. The agent of this change is remarkable for its alluding to a key passage in the earlier literature of catastrophe. While Mendele has been conversing with Kabtsielites, a young child has curled up upon his knees and fallen asleep. The child is frail and exhausted from life on the move and the dolorous innocence of his face asleep moves Mendele to a mood of pity and generosity of spirit. The child represents Kabstiel as a whole and by extension all Israel under the aspect of persecution. "I gazed at the child," says Mendele, "and my being melted away (ve-hishtappekhah</page><page sequence="8">270 ALAN MINTZ 'alai nafshi)."'2 The allusion is to that point in Chapter Two of Lamentations (vss. 11,12) when the poet breaks. down upon seeing children fainting from hunger in the besieged city. In both texts the child serves as that component of suffering to which no sin or deservingness can be attached, pure victim- hood detached from historical responsibility. In both texts as well, the spec- tacle of child suffering precipitates a collapse of the distance between the speaker and the subject of his discourse. Under the aspect of pathos, which Mendele now assumes, identical structures are given new interpretations. The mutual economic dependence that he had characterized a moment ago as idle parasitism is now cast in the hues of empathy and solicitude. That an entire town should take to the road in mourning for the destruction of the houses of a few of its citizens is the height of fellow-feeling, the quintessence of gemeinschaft. Kabtsiel is one body and when a limb becomes diseased it is felt by the whole. But what of the Jewish body politic as a whole? Kabtsielites may take care of their own, but is not Kabtsiel but one organ in the larger Jewish people? And if so, how can that organ be allowed to atrophy and wither? Kabtsiel's suffering is real, its disaster documented, yet its appeals for help have fallen on deaf ears. The community wanders through the Pale woe- begone and ignored. In the long monologue that concludes the story Mendele warns of the dire consequences of such neglect. Pushing the body metaphor still further, he predicts that if the diseased limb of Kabtsiel is not soon treated, the disease will infect the body as a whole. The kind of treat- ment he has in mind is philanthropy. If Jews fail to give their pennies volun- tarily now, they will be forced to give vast sums later on, and they in turn will become impoverished. The heated apocalyptic finale of Mendele's monologue unrolls a vision of the cancerous spread of pauperization to the whole of Israel. For having failed to deal kindly with Kabtsiel, the rest of the Jewish world will become Kabtsiel. Mendele's attitude toward the Kabtsielites reflects Abramowitsch's atti- tude toward his readers, and in general the attitude of the late Haskalah writer to the Jewish masses. That attitude, like the text of Ha-Nisrafim, was deeply divided between impulses of irony and pathos, aloofness and identifi- cation, indictment and advocacy. What is striking about the two halves of "Ha-Nisrafim" is how entirely unintegrated they remain: the movement from one to the other is more of a capitulation than a progression. The second half, moreover, offers no revisionary understanding of the people's status. 12. Ibid., p. 446.</page><page sequence="9">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 271 The suffering of the Kabtsielites becomes credible and affecting, but no less undeserved. And like parts of Lamentations itself (the beginning of Chapter Three, for example) this is an entirely internal Jewish drama; the enemy, the non-Jew, does not figure. This is all the more remarkable because the lesson of 1881 for many intellectuals was the frightening un- relatedness of antisemitism to the internal reform of Jewish life. For Abramowitsch, in short, the effect of 1881 can be summarized as follows: The pogroms released in him an outpouring of sympathy which had the effect of something added to his literary enterprise rather than something absorbed. The fundamental critique of Jewish life remained unaffected. The sign of the failure of this supplement to be absorbed is its sentimentality and didacticism, which stand in such contrast to the magisterial achievement of Abramowitsch's satire. There is an immense distance between Abramowitsch and the young Saul Tchernichowsky: Abramowitsch, the neoclassical prose satirist, the man of the Haskalah, the scion of talmudic erudition, and Tchernichowsky, the late romantic poet, the man of modern European culture, the rebel against the classical Jewish past. Yet the compressed development of Hebrew literature at the end of the century saw their careers overlap, when one man was in his sixties and the other in his twenties. Both writers responded in their works to the pogroms of 1881 and to the climate of Jewish society in their aftermath. The joint force of their writing was to interrogate the normative response of the Jewish intelligentsia and to under- mine its authority in a way that prepared the ground for Bialik's great state- ment after Kishinev. The specific component of the response which Tcherni- chowsky investigated was the phenomenon of medievalization: the tendency on the part of Jewry to read its situation as a recurrence of the persecutions of the Middle Ages. "Baruch of Mainz" ("Barukh mi-mageneah"), a narra- tive poem of some 800 lines, is set in Mainz at the time of the First Crusade and is clearly based on Tchernichowsky's readings in the newly available historiographical texts." The following section from the chronicle of Rabbi 13. Saul Tchernichowsky, Shirim, 2 vols. (Tel Aviv, 1966), 2: 523-50. References will be to pages in this edition. The poem was begun in Odessa in the late 1890s and finished in Heidel- berg in 1900. It should be noted how long before Kishinev, with which "Baruch of Mainz" is often associated, the poem was actually written. For the rather complicated publishing history of the poem, which involved problems with the censor, see Joseph Klausner, Sha'ul Tsherni- khovski, ha-'adam ve-ha-meshorer [Saul Tchernichowsky, The Man and the Poet] (Jerusalem, 1947), pp. 86-91.</page><page sequence="10">272 ALAN MINTZ Solomon bar Samson is one among several passages that may have served as the point of departure for Tchernichowsky's critically divergent reworking of the materials. The passage concerns one Master Isaac the Pious bar David Haparnas, who was forcibly baptized by the enemy and afterwards sought atonement for his sin. He came to his house and closed himself and his children within. He asked his children, "Is it your will that I sacrifice you to the Lord?" They responded, "Do with us what you wish." Isaac said, "O my children, the Lord is the true One-there is no other!" In the middle of the night Master Isaac brought his son and his daughter to the synagogue and slaughtered them before the ark for the sake of qiddush ha-shem .... He sprinkled their blood on the pillars of the holy ark so that their memory should come before the divine mercy seat. He proclaimed, "May this blood [also] serve as an expiation for all my sins!" He then set fire to the synagogue. He walked back and forth with his hands spread out to heaven, praying to God with a pleasing voice from within the flames. The enemies cried out to him through the windows, "Wicked man: Come out of the fire and be saved!" They extended a plank to him to grasp and be saved, but Isaac refused and was consumed, an excellent and God-fearing man whose soul reposes with the souls of the righteous in the Garden of Eden.'4 The considerable achievement of "Baruch of Mainz" is intelligible only if we keep in mind the specific set of associations that contemporary readers brought to the poem. This literary competence depends less on familiarity with particular passages or even particular texts than on the general aura of martyrological sanctity associated with the Crusades and the Middle Ages generally as a time of Jewish courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. Tcherni- chowsky tests these associations by making us view the events entirely from within the consciousness of one man, a man whose behavior deviates from this literary norm. The formal vehicle is the dramatic monologue; Baruch stands before the fresh grave of his wife and talks to her of what has tran- spired in the few days since her death. Like the classic dramatic monologue on the model of Browning and Tennyson, the poem is based on a dynamic of judgment and sympathy: the judgment that the reader makes of the speaker for his violation of moral norms and the sympathy that the speaker manages to win for himself by virtue of his voice, his presence, and the disclosure of his motives. The speaker's voice, of course, controls the telling of the tale, 14. A. B. Habermann, Gezerot 'Ashkenaz ve-Sarefat (Jerusalem, 1945), pp. 37-38.</page><page sequence="11">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 273 and the reader gets the information on which to base his judgments not through a linear narrative telling but through the strategic release of infor- mation as it serves the interests of the teller. More than in other poetic forms, the reading process in the case of the dramatic monologue is a matter of sequential discovery, a piecing together of the picture as new facts are dis- closed, often unintentionally. The poem begins with Baruch's stammering, distracted account of the day of the massacre in Mainz. All is confusion in his speech; fragments of voices and faces, torches and axes mix together in a metonymical chaos that seems designed to avoid calling attention to Baruch's own actions. Baruch, as it emerges from his jumbled telling, broke down when offered the choice between slaughter and conversion; he was dragged, mortified and confused, to the church, where he repeated those formulas he now does not wish to remember but whose damning import is inescapable. This revelation comes but some fifty lines into the poem, and it has the effect of already identifying Baruch as deviant from the martyrological norm and underscoring Tcherni- chowsky's choice to write a poem about the kind of figure that Jewish chroniclers preferred not to chronicle. Yet by the act of conversion Baruch has not disqualified himself entirely from the prerogatives of the martyr fig- ure. There remains the special instance of Master Isaac quoted above who, after converting, repented his deed and sacrificed his children and himself. Baruch's case, then, remains open. Baruch's attitude toward his deed goes much deeper than regret. In one of the several units that divert the sequential narrative, Baruch's memory is suddenly jogged into a reevocation of the day of his bar mitzvah: the min- gled feelings of sanctity, awe, and expectation at becoming fully part of the congregation of Israel through formal acceptance of the covenant (pp. 526-27). As the boy winds the straps of the phylacteries around his arm for the first time and recites the formula of commitment from Hosea 2, the present reality suddenly invades his reverie and is literally interspliced with the biblical verses. "And I will espouse you forever"- And the covenant have I overthrown... "And I will espouse you with goodness and mercy"- After foreign things have I wandered .... Baruch views his act with none of the generosity that Maimonides sought to extend to forced converts when he forbade them to consider themselves cut</page><page sequence="12">274 ALAN MINTZ off from the Jewish people and its salvation. Baruch's feelings, as becomes increasingly clear as the poem progresses, go beyond the purely religious stance of faithfulness and witness that marks even the more frenzied texts of medieval Ashkenaz. His sense of his own betrayal is absolute and unredeem- able, a defilement so deep that nothing can cleanse him. A sense of sin so acute that it simply cannot be borne requires interpretive categories beyond the religious or the national; it requires, in short, a psychological explana- tion that evokes the concept of guilt. Far from trivializing the poem, this necessary recourse to the psychological is what the poem is most profoundly about. As more and more of Baruch's behavior is revealed, we realize that his actions are motivated not by religious zeal-though this is their sanction and camouflage-but by a racking conviction of guilt that is inalienably his own. The price of his failure to take responsibility for his actions is exact- ed from others; a shame too deep to be borne is made to be borne by other lives. The bloodcurdling methods he employs resemble the acts described in the medieval chronicles, but they are not the same, and in this slight yet tell- ing dissimilarity lies the gathering subversive force of the text. The stirrings of our suspicion concerning Baruch's motives still do not entirely prepare us for his next revelation. In his rambling indirection Baruch lets out that he has "liberated the souls of his daughters" (p. 527). This act of slaughter in itself would not disbar him from the medieval norm were it not for his daughters' reactions and the reasons he gives for his deed. In contrast to Master Isaac's children in the chronicle, with their assured faith in their father's religious aspiration, Baruch's daughters, for reasons we learn later, are not eager to be liberated. The recollection of their implor- ing, unrelenting eyes forces itself uninvited into Baruch's discourse and forms a second foundation of shame and guilt. When Baruch recovers him- self he presents the rationale for his cruelty: He could not bear to contem- plate the possibility that his surviving daughters would become married to gentiles and give birth to sons who might eventually become killers of Jews. His reasons, it is important to note, are not those of the historical fathers of the chronicles. Their concern for their children's fate was a religious concern and their hope was that the sacrificial manner of their deaths would guaran- tee their children's future salvation. Baruch's reasons are not only national rather than religious, but they are also self-regarding. "I could not bear the bitterness of my fate," he explains. My fate. The source of his motives rests closer to an anxiety for his own expiation than a concern for his daughters' spiritual, clearly not physical, salvation.</page><page sequence="13">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 275 The poem now veers away from this painful subject and accommodates a substantial digression: an idyll concerning the harmony of the family's life before the massacre. The sonorous roll of rhyming couplets in the idyll con- trasts sharply with the turbulence of Baruch's speech until now, with its fre- quent enjambment, its lines of uneven length, and frequent ellipses. The shift and its fittingness remind us of Tchernichowsky's remarkable skill with pro- sody and his virtuosity in manipulating prosodic forms for strategic pur- poses. The idyll describes life in the lap of nature: the coming of night, the performance of simple daily tasks, the delights of birds and flowers, their house, their garden.'" The idyll is a reevocation of the past in its positive aspect, which makes the destruction more catastrophic by forcing us to experience the depth and substance of what was lost. The particular past evoked by Tchernichowsky makes an unexpected statement about Jewish history and the Exile. Where we might expect a picture of the everyday life of the medieval Jew to be painted with strokes of piety, fear of persecution, and longing for redemption, we get instead a portrait of natural man and his utter at-homeness in the bower of nature. The idyll, in the end, is only a temporary evasion of the reality of destruction. The very momentum of Baruch's speech leads him back to the fact of loss and the terrible question of responsibility. The narrative of the idyll moves from the substantial and weighty to the frail and wispy, from the heavens at night through the house and garden to the flowers themselves. The ponderousness of natural creation comes to rest on these flowers, which, in their blameless vulnerability and attractiveness to the hand of the picker, become a transparent figure for the slaughtered daughters. "It was not my hands that spilt the blood," Baruch avers, "and plucked the tender blossom/ But the hands of the enemy. .. ." (p. 535). With responsibility laid elsewhere, Baruch launches into a series of invidious and venomous curses hurled at the brutal gentiles. The language of the curses is taken from Leviti- cus 26 and Deuteronomy 27 as well as such medieval poems as the "Qelalah ve-shamta."'6 By itself this section was one of the high points of the poem for the contemporary audience, those who were able to read it in its uncensored version; its malediction of the gentiles was daring for the literary conven- tions of the times, both externally and internally imposed, and it had the 15.

Yet read within the sequential context of the poem, this rage against the Nations-very much part of the medievali- zation of the response to 1881-is undercut by irony: While the Nations do indeed deserve to be damned, we know that Baruch's project of damnation has originated in his need to alleviate his own guilt. A lush description of the depredations of vampire bats comes next, and it is here that Tchernichowsky scores his greatest success in manipulating the reader's experience of the poem. Although the description stands by itself, we assume that these noxious creatures and their foul acts must stand for something other than themselves, and in the absence of a given referent we naturally assume that the bats are a compressed and demonized symbol of the bloodthirsty Crusaders, who have just finished being anathematized. Yet we have been taken in. Renewing his address to his dead wife, Baruch begins the next section as follows: If only, my dove, you could become -And I with you Before my strength fails- That blood-sucking bat! Each night we would arise And ascend from the grave To drink and sate ourselves On blood of their cruel god. Baruch proceeds to explain to his wife how their nightly sorties will avenge, in an entirely literal way, the blood of the raped and slaughtered innocents. It is this grotesque nightmare that finally tips the balance of our judgment of Baruch irrevocably. When he reveals his longing to become not only as evil as the enemy but even less human, Baruch forfeits the vestiges of sympathy that had at least made it possible to view his motives as mixed or ambigu- ous. Tchernichowsky further underscores the unbridgeability of the distance between Baruch and the figures of the tradition by making his vision a black parody of the 'El malei rabamim, the preeminent memorial prayer of the Jewish liturgy. "O God, full of compassion, dwelling on high," the wor- shipper beseeches, "grant perfect rest under the wings of thy presence in the company of the holy and the pure that shines like heaven to the soul of [the 17. Klausner reports that in addition to the curses, the most admired and anthologized sec- tion of the poem was the description of the coming of night in the idyll.</page><page sequence="15">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 277 departed] who has gone to his eternal home."'8 Holy and pure, the martyred soul of Baruch's wife has apparently claimed its perfect rest in its eternal home. Baruch, who can never expect to achieve so much, proposes an exact perversion of the Jewish imagining of the future reward: ceaseless activity instead of perfect rest, nightly befoulment and pollution instead of the shin- ing of purity and holiness, self-powered flight on reptilian wings instead of enclosure under the wings of the Divine Presence. Baruch does not wait for the afterlife to take his revenge. From his cell in the monastery he starts a fire that destroys the church and spreads to the town as well. Neither his claim to be divinely commanded in his deed, nor his delirious fascination with the progress of the fire, nor the gratuitous cruelty of his refusal to save a bird nest from the flames-none of these are necessary any longer to substantiate Baruch's madness. It is now that we learn what we have suspected but not known regarding the manner of the daughters' death. They were left to be burned to death in the general confla- gration-perhaps together with the other surviving Jews of the city-instead of being ritually slaughtered in the sacrificial mode inscribed in the chroni- cles. Yet Tchernichowsky's text does not end in apocalypse. Baruch is not Samson, shouting "Let me die with the Philistines!" As a monologue, the discourse of the poem can be constituted and transmitted by nothing other than Baruch's persisting speech. The fiery consummation was not all- consuming; the speaking subject survives, survives ingloriously. In that per- sistence, so unlike the expiatory suicide by fire of the prototype Master Isaac, Baruch emerges as a new figure with its own prototypical force: the tainted survivor of modern literature. During Passover, 1903 a pogrom in the Bessarabian city of Kishinev left 45 Jews slain, 600 wounded, and 1500 houses and shops plundered or destroyed. The occasion for a substantial international outcry, the pogrom at Kishinev gave its name to what was actually a four-year-long series of pogroms. As a response to the growth of radical movements in Russia, the government found it useful to allow reactionary groups to blame the Jews for the increased revolutionary agitation. After the outbreaks at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, by far the greatest wave of pogroms occurred after the October revolution in the fall of 1905. In one week over 600 com- 18.

In addition to mass emigration, the intervening years had seen the mobilization of ideological programs whose purpose was to offer cures to maladies of which pogroms were the symptoms. It was the Zionists and the Bundists who were the principal organizers of local self-defense groups, which did mitigate the violence in some communities, though their effectiveness was often neutralized by the local police and militia and by their own crude state of organization. The twenty years since 1881 had also seen the appearance of a growing number of Hebrew and Yiddish writers, many of whom responded to the pogroms in the periodical press of the times. Popular Yiddish poetry, keynoted once more by the lyrics of Simon Frug, delivered outpourings of mercy and called for charitable assistance. The most traditional and sentimental response came from the branch of Hebrew literature that was by then already estab- lished in America, where publicistic denunciations of the perfidy of Russia and dirges styled on Lamentations were the norm. In Russia itself David Frishman's widely read poem "David in the Lion's Den" saw the pogroms as the dashing of the hopes for civilization at the very outset of the new cen- tury. Ya'akov Cahan idealized the Jewish fighters of antiquity, while I. L. Baruch and Pesah Kaplan modeled their poetic accounts of the pogroms on the martyrologies of 1096 and 1648.20 Of all these writings there is only one that warrants more than passing historical interest: Bialik's "In the City of Slaughter" ("Be-'Ir ha- haregah").21 In the same measure as these poems are predictable, sentimental, 19.

Malakhi, "The Kishinev Pogroms as Reflected in Hebrew and Yiddish Poetry" [Hebrew] in Al 'admat Besarabiah [On Bessarabian Soil], 3 vols., ed. Getzel Kressel (Jerusalem, 1963), 3: 1-98. 21. "In the City of Slaughter" was published with the title "Massa Nemirov" ("The Proph- ecy of Nemirov") in Ha-zeman (ed. Ben Zion Katz) 3 (1904). The title, which refers to 1648, was used to satisfy the censor's demand for nontopicality. The poem was published as "In the City of Slaughter" in pamphlet form in 1905/1906 together with two other poems. The pam- phlet was titled Mi-shirei ha-za'am (Songs of Wrath) and included the restoration of several censored lines. The Yiddish version ("In a shkhite shtot"), in which the poem gained wide dif- fusion, was done by Bialik himself in 1906 upon Peretz's failure to render a translation that satisfied Bialik. The Yiddish version is not a translation so much as a new version with its own artistic integrity.</page><page sequence="17">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 279 and conventional, Bialik's text is astonishing, austere, and pathbreaking. The circumstances under which "In the City of Slaughter" came to be writ- ten are worth noting. Immediately upon news of the pogrom in Kishinev, a committee of inquiry was formed in Odessa by such distinguished intellec- tuals as Ablad Ha-am, Simon Dubnow, and Abramowitsch. Bialik, thirty years old at the time, was dispatched to Kishinev by the committee with the charge of investigating and recording the facts of the event and producing a detailed account to be distributed among Jews in the West. When Bialik arrived in Kishinev a few weeks after the pogrom, the rubble and debris had hardly been disturbed. Bialik assiduously investigated all the damage, took testimony from observers, interviewed Jews from leaders to workers, and ended by filling four large notebooks with transcriptions and observations. Today these folios can be viewed in manuscript at the Bialik Archive in Tel Aviv. They were never published. Instead of submitting the notebooks, Bialik published "In the City of Slaughter," a major poem of some 300 lines, which excoriates the inhabitants of Kishinev for their failure to undertake efforts at self-defense, proclaims the deaths of the victims to be gratuitous, and refuses to mourn them. "In the City of Slaughter" is founded upon a lie. There was self-defense in Kishinev; it may not have been terribly great or effectual, but given the surprise of Kishinev-it was the first major outbreak of violence in twenty years-it is hardly reasonable to have expected more. The source of this con- tradictory evidence is nothing other than Bialik's own unpublished note- books.22 Diligent investigator that he was, Bialik had taken everything down, including descriptions of the attempts to fend off the attacks. Yet the claims of historicity were apparently secondary to the higher imaginative prerogatives Bialik wished to take. In the hyperbolic mode of the rabbis and the payyetanim, Bialik sought to make iconographic use of Kishinev by draining the event of its particularity and by informing it with symbolic power. Bialik wished to make Kishinev stand for something massive and millennial, and the "higher truth" superseded the contingent truth of the notebooks. 22. Some of the testimonies that Bialik took down have been published by Israel Halpern, ed., Sefer ha-gevurah: 'antologyah historit-sifrutit [The Book of Heroism: A Historical-Literary Anthology], 3 vols. (Tel Aviv, 1951), 3: 4-14. This project, whose first sections were published in 1941, records documents pertaining to Jewish self-defense amidst persecution from Massada to World War I. It was the first book issued by the publishing house Am Oved, and it is an extraordinary example of a Zionist attempt to create a countermythology to traditional martyr- ology.</page><page sequence="18">280 ALAN MINTZ The following English version by the Canadian Jewish poet A. M. Klein can stand on its own as a poetic composition. Klein has happily succeeded in conveying Bialik's juxtaposition of a high biblical diction with restraint and austerity in description.23 IN THE CITY OF SLAUGHTER (from Songs of Wrath) Arise and go now to the city of slaughter; Into its courtyard wind thy way. There with thine own hand touch, and with the eyes of thine head Behold on tree, on stone, on fence, on mural clay, The splattered blood and dried brains of the dead. Proceed then to the ruins, the split walls reach, Where wider grows the hollow and greater grows the breach; Pass over the shattered hearth, attain the broken wall Whose burnt and barren brick, whose charred stones reveal 10 The open mouths of such wounds, that no mending Shall ever mend, nor healing ever heal. There will thy feet in feathers sink, and stumble On wreckage doubly wrecked, scroll heaped on manuscript, Fragments again fragmented- Pause not upon this havoc; go thy way. The perfumes will be wafted from the acacia bud And half its blossoms will be feathers, Whose smell is the smell of blood! And, spiting thee, strange incense they will bring- 20 Banish thy loathing-all the beauty of the spring, The thousand golden arrows of the sun, Will flash upon thy malison; The sevenfold rays of broken glass Over thy sorrow joyously will pass, For God called up the slaughter and the spring together: The slayer slew, the blossom burst, and it was sunny weather! Then wilt thou flee to a yard, observe its mound. Upon the mound lie two, and both are headless- A Jew and his hound. 23. The Complete Poetic Works of Hayyim Nahman Bialik, ed.

Its cry will not be heard. It will descend into the deep, or water the cockle-burr, And all things will be as they ever were. Unto the attic mount, upon thy feet and hands; Behold the shadow of death among the shadows stands. 40 There in the dismal corner, there in the shadowy nook, Multitudinous eyes will look Upon thee from the sombre silence- The spirits of the martyrs are these souls, Gathered together, at long last, Beneath these rafters and in these ignoble holes. The hatchet found them here, and hither do they come To seal with a last look, as with their final breath, The agony of their lives, the terror of their death. Tumbling and stumbling wraiths, they come, and cower there. 50 Their silence whimpers, and it is their eyes which cry Wherefore, 0 Lord, and why? It is a silence only God can bear. Lift then thine eyes to the roof; there's nothing there Save silences that hang from rafters And brood upon the air: Question the spider in his lair! His eyes beheld these things; and with his web he can A tale unfold, horrific to the ear of man: A tale of cloven belly, feather-filled; 60 Of nostrils nailed, of skull-bones bashed and spilled; Of murdered men who from the beams were hung, And of a babe beside its mother flung, His mother speared, the poor chick finding rest Upon its mother's cold and milkless breast; Of how a dagger halved an infant's word, Its 'ma' was heard, its 'mama' never heard. O, even now its eyes from me demand accounting, For these the tales the spider is recounting, Tales that do puncture the brain, such tales that sever 70 Thy body, spirit, soul from life, forever!</page><page sequence="20">282 ALAN MINTZ Then wilt thou bid thy spirit:-Hold, enough! Stifle the wrath that mounts within thy throat, Bury these things accursed, Within the depth of thy heart, before thy heart will burst! Then wilt thou leave that place, and go thy way- And lo!-the earth is as it was, the sun still shines; It is a day like any other day. Descend then to the cellars of the town, There where the virgin daughters of thy folk were fouled, 80 Where seven heathen flung a woman down, The daughter in the presence of her mother, The mother in the presence of her daughter, Before slaughter, during slaughter and after slaughter! Touch with thy hand the cushion stained; touch The pillow incarnadined: This is the place the wild ones of the wood, the beasts of the field With bloody axes in their paws compelled thy daughters to yield: Beasted and swined! Note also, do not fail to note, 90 In that dark corner and behind that cask Crouched husbands, bridegrooms, brothers, peering from the cracks, Watching the martyred bodies struggling underneath The bestial breath, Stifled in filth, and swallowing their blood. Watching from the darkness and its mesh The lecherous rabble portioning for booty Their kindred and their flesh. Crushed in their shame, they saw it all; They did not stir or move; 100 They did not pluck their eyes out, they Beat not their brains against the wall, Perhaps, perhaps, each watcher had it in his heart to pray, A miracle, 0 Lord, and spare my skin this day! Those who survived this foulness, who from their blood awoke, Beheld their life polluted, the light of their world gone out- How did their menfolk bear it, how did they bear this yoke? They crawled forth from their holes and fled to the house of the Lord, They offered thanks to Him, the sweet benedictory word. The Cohanim sallied forth, to the Rabbi's house they flitted: 110 Tell me, 0 Rabbi, tell, is my own wife permitted?

The seed of saints, the scions of the lions... Who, crammed by scores in all the sanctuaries of their shame, 120 So sanctified My name! It was the flight of mice they fled The scurrying of roaches was their flight; They died like dogs, and they were dead! And on the next morn, after the terrible night The son who was not murdered found The spurned cadaver of his father on the ground. Now wherefore dost thou weep, 0 son of man? Descend into the valley; verdant, there A garden flourishes, and in the garden 130 A barn, a shed,-it was their abattoir; There, like a host of vampires, puffed and bloated, Besotted with blood, swilled from the scattered dead, The tumbril wheels lie spread- Their open spokes, like fingers stretched for murder, Like vampire-mouths their hubs still clotted red. Enter not now, but when the sun descends Wrapt in bleeding clouds and girt with flame, Then open the gate and stealthily do set Thy foot within the ambient of horror: 140 Terror floating near the rafters, terror Against the walls in darkness hiding, Terror through the silence sliding. Didst thou not hear beneath the heap of wheels A stirring of crushed limbs? Broken and racked Their bodies move a hub, a spoke Of the circular yoke; In death-throes they contort, In blood disport; And their last groaning, inarticulate 150 Rises above thy head, And it would seem some speechless sorrow, Sorrow infinite, Is prisoned in this shed. It is, it is the Spirit of Anguish! Much-suffering and tribulation-tried</page><page sequence="22">284 ALAN MINTZ Which in this house of bondage binds itself. It will not ever from its pain be pried. Brief-weary and forespent, a dark Shekhinah Runs to each nook and cannot find its rest; 160 Wishes to weep, but weeping does not come; Would roar, is dumb. Its head beneath its wing, its wing outspread Over the shadows of the martyred dead, Its tears in dimness and in silence shed. And thou, too, son of man, close now the gate behind thee; Be closed in darkness now; now thine that charnel space; So tarrying there thou wilt be one with pain and anguish And wilt fill up with sorrow thine heart for all its days. Then on the day of thine own desolation 170 A refuge will it seem,- Lying in thee like a curse, a demon's ambush, The haunting of an evil dream, O, carrying it in thy heart, across the world's expanse Thou wouldst proclaim it, speak it out,- But thy lips shall not find its utterance. Beyond the suburbs go, and reach the burial ground. Let no man see thy going; attain that place alone, A place of sainted graves and martyr-stone. Stand on the fresh-turned soil. 180 Such silence will take hold of thee, thy heart will fail With pain and shame, yet I Will let no tear fall from thine eye. Though thou wilt long to bellow like the driven ox That bellows, and before the altar balks, I will make hard thy heart, yea, I Will not permit a sigh. See, see, the slaughtered calves, so smitten and so laid; Is there a price for their death? How shall that price be paid? Forgive, ye shamed of the earth, yours is a pauper-Lord- 190 Poor was He during your life, and poorer still of late. When to my door you come to ask for your reward, I'll open wide: see, I am fallen from my high estate. I grieve for you, my children, my heart is sad for you.

For great is the anguish, great the shame on the brow; But which is greater, son of man, say thou- Or liefer keep thy silence, bear witness in My name To the hour of My sorrow, the moment of My shame. And when thou dost return Bring thou the blot of My disgrace upon thy people's head, And from My suffering do not part, But set it like a stone within their heart. 210 Turn, then, to leave the cemetery ground, And for a moment thy swift eye will pass Upon the verdant carpet of the grass- A lovely thing! Fragrant and moist, as it is always at the coming of the Spring. The stubble of death, the growth of tombstones! Take thou a fistful, fling it on the plain Saying, "the people is plucked grass; can plucked grass grow again?" Turn then thy gaze from the dead, and I will lead Thee from the graveyard to thy living brothers, And thou wilt come, with those of thine own breed, 220 Into the synagogue, and on a day of fasting, To hear the cry of their agony, their weeping everlasting. Thy skin will grow cold, the hair on thy skin stand up, And thou wilt be by fear and trembling tossed; Thus groans a people which is lost. Look in their hearts, behold a dreary waste, Where even vengeance can revive no growth, And yet upon their lips no mighty malediction Rises, no blasphemous oath. Are they not real, their bruises? 230 Why is their prayer false? Why, in the day of their trials Approach me with pious ruses, Afflict me with denials?

Demand the retribution for the shamed Of all the centuries and every age! Let fists be flung like stone Against the heavens and the heavenly Throne! And thou too, son of man, be part of these: 250 Believe the pangs of their heart, believe not their litanies. And when the cantor lifts his voice to cry: Remember the martyrs, Lord, Remember the cloven infants, Lord, Consider the sucklings, Lord, And when the pillars of the synagogue shall crack at this piteous word And terror shall take thee, fling thee in its deep, Then I will harden My heart; I will not let thee weep. Should then a cry escape from thee, I'll stifle it within thy throat. 260 Let them assoil their tragedy, Not thou-let it remain unmourned For distant ages, times remote, But thy tear, son of man, remain unshed!

So in thy heart it shall remain confined A serpent in its nest-O terrible tear!- Until by thirst and hunger it shall find 270 A breaking of its bond. Then shall it rear Its venomous head, its poisoned fangs, and wait To strike the people of thy love and hate! Leave now this place at twilight to return And to behold these creatures who arose In terror at dawn, at dusk now, drowsing, worn With weeping, broken in spirit, in darkness shut.

Their hearts are broken.</page><page sequence="25">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 287 No lustre in the eye, no hoping in the mind, 280 They grope to seek support they shall not find: Thus when the oil is gone the wick still sends its smoke; Thus does an old beast of burden still bear its yoke. Would that misfortune had left them some small solace Sustaining the soul, consoling their gray hairs! Behold, the fast is ended; the final prayers are said. But why do they tarry now, these mournful congregations? Shall it be also read, The Book of Lamentations? It is a preacher mounts the pulpit now. 290 He opens his mouth, he stutters, stammers. Hark The empty verses from his speaking flow. And not a single mighty word is heard To kindle in the hearts a single spark. The old attend his doctrine, and they nod. The young ones hearken to his speech; they yawn. The mark of death is on their brows; their God Has utterly forsaken every one. And thou, too, pity them not, nor touch their wound; Within their cup no further measure pour. 300 Wherever thou wilt touch, a bruise is found. Their flesh is wholly sore. For since they have met pain with resignation And have made peace with shame, What shall avail thy consolation? They are too wretched to evoke thy scorn. They are too lost thy pity to evoke. So let them go, then, men to sorrow born, Mournful and slinking, crushed beneath their yoke. Go to their homes, and to their hearth depart- 310 Rot in the bones, corruption in the heart. And when thou shalt rise upon the morrow And go upon the highway. Thou shalt then meet these men destroyed by sorrow, Sighing and groaning, at the doors of the wealthy, Proclaiming their sores like so much peddler's wares, The one his battered head, the other his limbs unhealthy, One shows a wounded arm, and one a fracture bares.

In its own time "In the City of Slaughter" was read as a violent rebuke hurled by the poet Bialik at the people Israel. Although this may indeed be the deep message of the poem, it is so completely at odds with the surface structure of the text, especially as regards who is speaking and who is being spoken to, that the issue of what the poem is fundamentally about has to be opened up and questioned. The proper point of departure for such an inquiry is the rhetorical arrangements of the poem, the arrangements that are brought into being by the text's first line: "Arise and go now to the city of slaughter." The imperative mood of the verbs, and the existence they</page><page sequence="27">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 289 require of a speaker who commands and a listener who is commanded, con- stitute a rhetorical structure that remains unchanged throughout the poem. The imperative mood means that the discourse of the poem is not lyric expression or narrative description but dramatic speech, utterances made before a listener whose presence is dramatized within the text. The un- changingness of the imperative mood further means that the listener is never allowed to respond by bringing his own speech into the text, a fact which makes "In the City of Slaughter" properly classifiable as a monologue in the imperative mood. This exclusion implies the existence, also, of a will con- stantly being curbed, a task constantly being imposed, a response constantly being stifled. Who is this imperatorial speaker who monopolizes the discourse of the poem? His identity can be inferred from the more obvious identity of the addressee. The high biblical idiom of the poem and the formulas of address ("son of man," "Arise and go") and many other cues make it clear that it is a prophet who is being spoken to and, therefore, that it is God who is speak- ing. The poem, then, is a monologue in which God issues a series of man- dates to a prophet. The status of the poem as God's monologue means that even though the poem ridicules traditional religious hopes and travesties the image of God as the dispenser of future rewards, God remains the speaker of the poem. God's voice constitutes an unironized-or perhaps, transironic in the sense of beyond irony-framework of value within which the poem's famous and flagrant impieties, derisions, and sacrileges are enacted. It is against the people's self-regarding and self-enfeebling conception of God that the mockery is directed rather than against the referent of that concep- tion, Who in fact issues calls for accusation and rebellion against Himself. Yet in the ontology of the text this sovereignty is, of course, qualified by the existence of a prior source of authority. This derives from the distinction between a dramatized figure within the text, God, and the producer of the text itself, namely, the poet. It is a matter of no small presumption on Bialik's part to write God's words and to write a poem that presents itself in the guise of divine revelation. It is a measure both of the persistent power of the idea of God and of its usurpation by the romantic artist who moves to appropriate it for symbolic use. There is a greater presumption. God is God, but is Bialik His prophet? There is an unmistakable identity set up between the prophet-addressee and the poet Bialik. The poem is about the poet's responsibilities in responding to catastrophe, and more specifically, about Bialik's mission to Kishinev. By casting this theme in terms of biblical prophecy and by himself assuming the</page><page sequence="28">290 ALAN MINTZ persona of the prophet, Bialik set up a series of expectations, some of which he fulfills in earnest and others of which he tampers with. Like prophecy, it is implied that the poetic mission is imposed upon the poet from without rather than projected by his own will, and further, that the mission is invest- ed with the kind of sacred authority that cannot be supplied by the poet's own subjectivity. The price for this high sanction is the vitiation of the poet's will. He is moved from space to space in the poem like a counter on a board, while being systematically enjoined from following the promptings of his own heart. At the center of the prophetic vocation is the preaching of the word of God. The prophet is not called simply to enjoy a special private relationship to God; he is a vessel through which God's will is communicated to Israel so that Israel may be chastised or consoled. The prophet exists for Israel's sake, not for God's. He is chosen for his faculty of pathos; the people's whoring after other gods fires him with the fury of denunciation because of his pro- found concern for the dire consequences of such actions; and when the people reel from the tortures of their enemies, the prophet feels their pain and is moved to comfort them. In the poem it is just this most central function of prophecy that God countermands. To address the people, to rebuke them or reassure them, to vent his rage or impart his empathy-at every turn this is what the prophet is ordered not to do. The interdiction concerns expression, not feeling. He must witness the horror of the slaughter and the greater horror of the be- havior of the bystanders and survivors and feel his prophetic rage mount with every sight; yet he is forbidden, for reasons we shall learn, to do what a prophet does, to communicate that rage to his people. The act of communi- cation never takes place; though there is an explosive release in the last lines of the poem, it is solitary and onanistic. Yet what of the people? Is not "In the City of Slaughter" a poem essen- tially about the Jews of Eastern Europe, their bankrupt traditions of quiet- ism, their political ignorance, their venality in the face of persecution, their exploitation of religion? And though they may neither speak nor be spoken to, are they not the very subject of God's discourse and the stimulus of the poet's feelings? Yes, certainly. But the conspicuous exclusion of the people from the communicative act must alert us to the fact that the obvious and commonsensical subject of the poem is not its only subject. "In the City of Slaughter" is a poem with two themes. Beneath the manifest question of the condition of the people lies the question of the romantic poet, the sources of his authority, the nature of his responsibility to the nation, the fate of his</page><page sequence="29">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 291 burden of feeling in the face of the unspeakable. In the course of the poem the manifest is displaced by the latent. This displacement grows as the poem progresses. The poem is organized into units according to the cycle of one day (from morning to evening) and according to a series of physical sites through which the poet is moved-the attics, the cellars, the stables, the cemetery, the synagogues, and so on. In each unit the poet is instructed to inspect the traces of the pogrom and imagine its reality; he is encouraged to allow this imagining to fill him with wrath and fury, but he is enjoined from giving vent to these feelings and is instead moved to the next site. However, although in the first sections of the work what the poet sees, the people and the pogrom, is the focus, it is the deepening crisis of the seer that comes increasingly to occupy the dramatic center. Let us therefore examine first Bialik's presentation of the theme of the people and the pogrom and then the gathering drama of the poet. Bialik makes us see the pogrom with the same effectual restraint that marks all his operations in the poem. Raised on the pogrom literature bur- lesqued by Abramowitsch, the contemporary reader comes to the poem with an appetite for high pathos and figurative exhorbitance. He finds instead a text that systematically declines to feed this hunger. "In the City of Slaughter" contains almost no explicit metaphors. The poem is written in the metonymical mode. When we do come across one of the poem's half- dozen similes (in 348 lines), we savor some release from the unremitting focus on stones and feathers and broken glass, on things, a release into some realm of reality outside the world of the pogrom. Instead, the experience of reading the similes is like stepping on a land mine. Take the figure at the opening of the poem: ... attain the broken wall Whose burnt and barren brick, whose charred stones reveal [resemble] The open mouths of such wounds, that no mending Shall ever mend, nor healing ever heal. (11. 8-11) The unsettling effect of Bialik's metaphors derives from the realms of objects they conspire to confuse. The pattern often involves a comparison of in- animate objects to ones that are animate but hardly human. Here the holes in walls that have been burnt through to the bare brick are likened to fester- ing, incurable wounds. Material damage is bad enough but at least it is final; comparing it to an animal or human wound introduces a quality of infec-</page><page sequence="30">292 ALAN MINTZ tious persistence, which is made all the more ghoulish by giving the wounds disembodied humanoid mouths. (There is a play here on 'anush, "incurable," and 'enosh, "human.") In a figure in 11. 131-35 that recalls Tcherni- chowsky, the crisscrossing of boundaries between the human and the inani- mate and the noxiously humanoid is still more complexly grotesque. In the stables where much of the slaughter took place, the scattered piles of car- riage wheels, which are established as a metonymic stand-in for the enemy, are compared to an encampment of sated vampire bats, "Their open spokes, like fingers stretched for murder,/Like vampire mouths their hubs still clot- ted red." These strong effects, these little gruesome explosions of meaning, are effective in their rarity, and they suggest the kind of poem, perhaps a Tchernichowskian text, that Bialik chose not to write. The ruling passion of "In the City of Slaughter" is metonymic. Whereas metaphor establishes similarity between things otherwise different, metonymy makes equivalences according to contiguity or association, that is, between part and whole, cause and effect, thing and attribute. In the figure above, the comparison of the opened-spoke wheels to vampire bats is a type of metaphor; the wheels as a substitute for the murderers are an example of a metonymy in which the instrument stands for its agents. Metonymy is Bialik's major strategy for presenting the pogrom because of the possibilities it affords for indirection. Walking through the city of slaughter the poet is forced to observe the detri- tus of the massacre: the bloodsplattered and brain-splattered walls, the burnt-out houses, the mounds of broken glass, the omnipresent feathers from slit bedding. He is forced to observe, in short, the traces and effects of the event but not the event itself. Even when the poet imagines the scenes of carnage in retrospect, it is in terms of axes and eyes alone (11. 46-51). The spatial organization of the poem is part of this strategy. Each of the sites through which the poet is moved has its own floating ambiance of horror that suggests the events but does not dramatize them. A text that is alluded to but not introduced is part of a metonymic procedure as well. Literary allusion, to be sure, is the very stuff of Bialik's poetic language, the essential technique used with virtuosity for all purposes. What is especially relevant is Bialik's ability to suggest the resonances of the entire Jewish literature of atrocity without himself having to cover the same ground: A tale of cloven belly, feather-filled, A tale of nostrils and nails, skull and mallet; A tale of murdered men who from the rafters were hung;</page><page sequence="31">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 293 A tale of a babe beside his mother flung... A tale of an infant halved ... I have made the translation on 11. 59-65 more literal here to stress the sense of catalogued repetition that comes from the anaphoric "A tale of ... (ma'aseh be-...)" that begins each line in the Hebrew. The catalogue as a whole evokes-in the most parsimonious way-an entire body of literature: Lamentations, the midrash, the piyyutim and chronicles, as well as the con- temporary journalistic accounts of the pogroms, and it indicates the degree to which in this elaborate literary tradition each instance of atrocity has itself become a conventional set-piece, a topos. To recall it to mind, the reader need only be supplied a few charged words. Metonymy is a technique of annoyance. Metaphor purveys the aesthetic pleasure of suddenly seeing a similarity between unlikely objects. Metonymy frustrates by deflecting us from the thing itself and allowing us access only to its residuum, its atmosphere, its paraphernalia. Bialik's motives for so rigid- ly enforcing the metonymic mode are several. It is an attempt to find a way out of the dilemma first faced by the poets of Lamentations: how to thwart the dulling effects of convention and convey the true horror of horror. True horror resides not in language but in the mind; supplying a few metonymic details invites the reader to complete the picture with materials from his own inchoate reservoir of fear. To say "tale of nostrils and nails" is to say quite enough to imagine the worst-much worse than could have been explicitly rendered. Yet for Bialik the summoning of terror and atrocity remains a subsidiary objective in "In the City of Slaughter"; he is concerned less with the slaughter than with the response to the slaugher, how the purgative rituals of weeping and mourning can neutralize the sense of outrage and draw the horror into the quiescent folds of the tradition. So, while Bialik does not minimize the slaughter, he does not seek to feed this Jewish appetite for breast-beating and a good cry. And as readers we are as suspect in this regard as Abramowitsch's Kabtsielites and the survivors satirized later in the poem. By failing to provide a direct description of the pogrom Bialik declines to supply the gratifications of representation and forces us to make do with the understatement of metonymic fragments. This fragmentariness of description is one of the factors that makes for the poem's inner generic tension. "In the City of Slaughter" plays on the idea of epic. The high seriousness of its subject plus the unironized rhetorical framework involving God and prophet endow the poem with an epic tenor and an epic ambitiousness, as does the high biblical diction and rigorous</page><page sequence="32">294 ALAN MINTZ spatial and temporal organization of the composition. Indeed the term poema, which implies epic intention, was used by Bialik to describe his work. Yet his harshest contemporary critic was quick to point out how many of the essential properties of epic are wanting in "In the City of Slaughter."24 There is no completely realized picture of external events, and few epic similes, while there is much travesty and low comedy. Most prob- lematic is the absence of epic action; there is no hero who does anything. And because there is no project undertaken, there can be no sense of tragedy consequent upon his failure, perhaps in the sense that the Crusader chroni- cles are tragic, and thus transcendent, because of the active nobility of their suffering. Now, whatever Bialik meant by calling the work a poema, it is evident that the point of the poem is the absence of just that sort of transcen- dent action or transcendent suffering promised by epic. "In the City of Slaughter" is not about tragic defeat but failure to initiate. It is neither an epic nor a mock-epic. It is rather an antiepic, which proposes its own, nega- tive, principles of meaning. The indirection of metonymy performs the additional function of keep- ing the perpetrators of the pogrom out of the poem. We see only the instru- ments, the sites, and the effects of the destruction, not the destroyers them- selves. Disembodied, they exist only through the ax, the wagon wheel, the hammer. This enables Bialik to eliminate the enemy as a touchstone of antipathy and abomination and to force the reader to transfer those emotions to the interiorless drama of Jew and Jew, God and His people, the poet-prophet, his sender and audience. The refusal to allow the reader egress from this impacted family scene is one of the great autocratic coer- cions of the poem. It is an exclusion, it should be recalled, that is well precedented in the classical literature, where, except for cries for vindica- tion, the interpretation of catastrophe was largely kept within the internal dynamics of the covenant and its partners. Bialik's motives may not be the same as the tradition's, but his move is one of almost liturgical familiarity. The use Bialik makes of the texts of the tradition, especially the martyro- logical traditions, is perhaps the most celebrated aspect of the poem. "In the City of Slaughter" is a perverse summa of motifs and allusion put to parody. Nearly every line blushes to disclose a mangled quotation or a discordant textual resonance: menusat berev ("flight from the sword," Lev. 26:36) 24. The critic was probably Nahum Syrkin. See Malakhi, pp. 70-72 and p. 79 on David Frishman's criticism.</page><page sequence="33">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 295 becomes menusat 'akhbarim ("flight of/from mice," 1. 121); the martyred Rabbi Akiva's dying witness "[God is] One!" (yase'ah nishmato be-'ebhad) becomes the stabbed infant's appeal "Mama!" (yape'ah nishmato be-'immi, 1. 66). There are hundreds of such small effects, and proper study of the ways in which they inflect their sources would yield an entire taxonomy of deformations, stunning in its virtuosity. How variously and to what effect Bialik works within the space between the original and his invention is indeed a subject unto itself, and a vast one. Common to all these maneuvers is the manipulation of the reader's familiarities and expectations and the manipulation of levels of tone and diction. An example of this in a more extended passage is the attic rape sequence in 11. 78-112. The first third of the passage (11. 78-89) is entirely in earnest. The traditional and contempo- rary literature that describes such scenes is evoked not to be undercut but to be done one better. Bialik is showing that when it comes to terror and pathos he can push the register of affect very high when it suits him; and even this through metonymic references to soiled cushions and bloodied pil- lows and by the understated bestiality of such a line as "Before the slaughter, during the slaughter, after the slaughter!" This is the one place where the enemy is imagined and vilified; there is even in 11. 81-82 a non- ironic reference to a set of well-known midrashim on Hosea 10:14, "When mothers and babes were dashed to death together." Now, as the momentum of outrage is in full force Bialik suddenly shifts the subject to the cowardly menfolk in the cellar hiding places. Our repulsion, once aroused, is not stayed but transferred onto the Jewish males, whose criminal inaction is now made to seem more ghastly than the loathesome deeds of the goy. The description of the abominations of the goy is continued but we now see them as relayed through the eyes of the bystanders. Forced into this vantage point, our perception as readers becomes soiled and compromised. The tone of the passage, which began earnestly in pathos and turned to contempt, crosses over with the "Perhaps, perhaps" of 1. 102 into ridicule and sarcasm. The seriousness of even the contempt is undercut in the end; the passage concludes (11. 111-112) with the sense of the absurd futility of a world unchanged by atrocity, the final note of most of the early sections of the poem. In short, by treating us to the earnest rape scene in the beginning with its traditionally identified victims and perpetrators, Bialik has drawn us in to a very different distribution of blame and feeling than we were originally prepared to make. The cemetery scene (ll. 175-209) uses a similar lure-the ritual of visiting the graves of the righteous-to set up the reader for what is perhaps Bialik's most sardonic burlesque, the parody of the expectation of</page><page sequence="34">296 ALAN MINTZ afterlife and future reward, the conviction so fundamental to the motives and experience of medieval martyrs. With so much parody and travesty, what is left in the poem that is serious? "In the City of Slaughter" has often been taken as an indictment of the Jewish past and a repudiation of the habit of passivity as reflected in the martyrological traditions. There is a need to make discriminations in this matter. The poem's dazzling rhetorical effects should not lead to a confus- ing of passivity with the tradition, of the conduct of the moment with the precedents of the past. The Jews who cower in the outhouses and pigpens are called "the sons of the Maccabees!/The Seed of Saints, the scion of the lions ([ninei ha-'arayot she-ba-"av ha-rahamim" ve-zera' ha-"qedoshim"]," the reference is to 1096 especially). But the sobriquets are used in the ironic sense that these Jews are the betrayers of this inheritance. The spiritual cour- age and defiance involved in the ideal and practice of qiddush ha-shem is not impugned as much as the self-serving arrogation of that sanction and its application to a shameful want of courage and defiance. Martyrdom as a response to catastrophe was appropriate in its time; its persistent idealiza- tion in the modern age is a cover for a failure of nerve and a blaspheming of the memory of the truly great. What was once classical is now degenerate, the vital now effete. The same applies to more theological concepts. Immor- tality per se is not travestied as much as the readiness of the survivors to accept the assurance of a future reward as an easy consolation. Bialik, in brief, negates not the texts and ideas of the tradition but the liturgical use to which they have been put. To be sure, this is not a small negation. To inter- pret new disasters liturgically, to asborb them into a millennial drama, to draw off their destabilizing force, to be quieted by promises of redemption and to persevere in faith-what was appropriate and even creative in its own time has become pretext and evasion. To put one's finger on the poem's center of gravity requires looking to the theme of God and prophet. God, as we have said, may parody Himself as a bankrupt householder with bare cupboards but He remains the speaker of the poem and we believe at least in the poem. The instructions God gives to the poet-prophet concerning his task form the "transironic" theme of "In the City of Slaughter." The poet's crisis is real and engaged, while the people's crisis, despite all the weeping and howling, is dodged. Like the people's, the poet's ordeal demands the discarding of a no-longer appropri- ate set of practices for a new role, a new definition of the poetic vocation. The lineaments of that role are adumbrated in the early sections of the poem. The poet is instructed-as Bialik in his researches did indeed do-to</page><page sequence="35">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 297 expose himself to and inspect every detail of the massacre; to wade through the bloodied feathers, to see the brain-splattered walls, to take in his hands the befouled cushions, to hear the tales of atrocity, "Tales that do puncture the brain, such tales that sever/Thy body, spirit, soul from life, forever!" (11. 69-70). Yet when the cry of pain and outrage uncontrollably rises to his lips he is commanded to stifle it and keep silent, and he is transferred else- where to inspect yet another site of slaughter. These forced confrontations climax in the stables among the carriage wheels where the poet is faced with "Terror floating near the rafters, terror/ Against the wall in darkness hiding" (11. 140-41). It is explained to him that this speechless, infinite sorrow is the Spirit of Anguish (ruab dakka). (In a similar way the poet's sympathetic soul is briefly externalized and personi- fied as a dark Shekhinah, grief-stricken yet unable to weep; this is an internal allusion to such earlier works of Bialik as "Le-vaddi.") The poet is instructed to closet himself in the dark barn with the sorrow, to commune with it (ve-hityabadta), to incorporate the sorrow into himself and fill himself with it (11. 166-76). When the day of his desolation comes, when his own resources of wrath have been exhausted, he will be able to rely upon the sorrow he had earlier taken on and be revived in his rage, as if drawing from a poisonous well (ma'yan tar'elah, this phrase is missing in the transla- tion). In the meantime, the sorrow will remain within him, pressing and gnawing like a nightmare. Though he would "proclaim it, speak it out," his "lips shall not find its utterance" (1. 176). Two moments of release are finally granted in the concluding sections of the poem; one is potent but imaginary, the other real but futile. The poem is preoccupied in all its parts with the suppression and release of feeling. What is the meaning of this preoccupation? Bialik, it might be argued, is carrying forward the great Abramowitsch theme of the sublimation of feeling into speech rather than action. The satiric scenes of the poem concern the popu- lar clamor for channeling the anguish of persecution into outpourings of lamentation and consolation rather than enduring the anguish and translat- ing it into the realities of political organization. Less evident is the complic- ity of the poet-prophet. His ringing denunciations and soothing assurances had been absorbed into the dynamics of breast-beating and catharsis, and had been used more to oil the machinery of delusion that play havoc with it. The fulminations of a national poet like Judah Loeb Gordon had in time come to be ignored or taken for granted, and so Bialik, the inheritor of that mantle, had been obliged to perform the standard prophetic service in an hour of crisis by excoriating the enemy, beatifying the victims, and comfort-</page><page sequence="36">298 ALAN MINTZ ing the survivors, or even for that matter by reproaching the people for their passivity. The interdiction of expression touches the most fundamental con- ception of what it means to be a romantic poet. Not unlike the prophet, the poet is endowed with an exquisite sensitivity to the stimuli of the world, which in turn moves him to express the feelings called forth from his soul; this is the sympathetic rapport between the poetic soul and the anima mundi. What is more, it is the world that needs and benefits from the outpourings of the poet's soul and from the great truths they contain. To permit feeling but forbid expression is a move of great consequence. This wedge has been driven into the poet's being because expression itself has become suspect. Giving constant release to his feelings is doing what comes too naturally. The venting and dispersion of his discourse serves, as in the case of the people, as too comfortable a purgation; it is a discharge, moreover, that comes to no account, so easily is it neutralized and absorbed into the self- serving expectations of its listeners. National crisis requires a rude reshaping of the poetic vocation. The commanding voice of the poem calls upon the poet to work against the grain of his nature: He must forswear release and allow the sorrow and the wrath to collect within him. As the pressure builds, his anguished feelings will undergo a process of acidification, by which they are reduced to a bitter essence of rancor and bile. This now becomes the wellspring of the poet's imagination; this is the ma'yan tar'elah, the poisonous fountain, the black muse. Ll. 264-73 present an alternative image of this dark essence as a weapon rather than a source. The stifled fury, the unshed tears, the repressed cry are pictured as a venomous serpent coiled within the bronze vault of the poet's heart, which God will harden like the heart of Pharoah. When the serpent has been driven mad by thirst and hunger, it will be sent forth to "strike the people of thy love and hate!" As baleful as they are, the fountain and the serpent are images of potency and replenishment. Something grows in the breast of the poet, even if it is the malignancy of malediction. In contrast to this negative transcendence stands the sterility of the survivors of the catastrophe. Their hearts are "a dreary waste,/where even vengeance can revive no growth" (11. 226-27). God has left off hoping that suffering will engender embitterment and embitterment curse and vengeance against the enemy-and against God Himself. The people are disconsolate, immobilized, broken; they stumble through empty rituals of mourning, mumbling the formulas of consolation. They are moved from this inertia, however, in the apocalyptic vision of beg- gary with which the theme of the people is brought to a close. When they get up from their mourning on the next day, they finally bestir themselves; but</page><page sequence="37">RUSSIAN POGROMS IN HEBREW LITERATURE 299 they move not in order to take stock, to rethink, to organize, but in order to make themselves into nisrafim, professional traveling beggars who make a living by exploiting their misfortune. Domesticating catastrophe by mercan- tilizing it is a prospect that is pure Abramowitsch, but Abramowitsch with- out the humor and pathos. Bialik pushes further into the absurd grotesque: As if their own wounds and stumps are not enough to arouse profitable sympathy, the survivors flock to the cemetery to dig up the bodies of the slain and fill their knapsacks with the bones of their brethren to be hawked as relics at country fairs. "In the City of Slaughter" ends finally in release but no connection. As the poet-prophet was enjoined to journey to the city at the opening of the poem, so at its conclusion is he ordered to abandon the city for the wilder- ness. Throughout the poem the wilderness had been the symbol of both the consummate indifference of nature to the outrage of the pogrom (11. 36-37) and the arid void of the survivors' souls. The wilderness takes on the final association of the place prophets go when their missions have been thwart- ed. Yet for Bialik's poet-prophets there is no renewal of the calling, no reve- lation, no still small voice. He is given only to rend his soul into shreds like the metonymical debris of the pogrom and let all the carefully starved wrath finally explode. But the explosion is drowned out by the storm, which oblit- erates all meaning and message. The word never connects with the people; the viper, once released, is borne off by the wind. This image of onanism, of course, is belied by the fact of the existence of the poem and by Bialik's continued poetic engagement in the affairs of his people. His repudiation was as hyperbolic as the apocalypse of beggary. And in point of fact, the words were not carried off by the storm. Published after the first round of a protracted series of pogroms between 1903 and 1906, "In the City of Slaughter" did actually foster the organization of Jewish self-defense in the outbreaks that followed. The poem did much, in addition, to further the cause of Zionism among the young men and women of the Pale. In the later imagination of the Yishuv the poem became a proof- text for the degeneracy of the diaspora mentality. In our own day, "In the City of Slaughter" has found perhaps its most ironic employment as a con- temporary addition to the martyrology of the Yom Kippur liturgy.25 25. Jules Harlow, ed.
