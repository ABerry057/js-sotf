<plain_text><page sequence="1">William B. Helmreich. The World of the Yeshiva. An Intimate Portrait of Orthodox Jewry. New York: Free Press, 1982. 412 pp. This book is an effort to describe American Lithuanian or non-Hasidic type yeshivas (author's spelling) through participant observation, inter- views, and a survey of alumni. The core of the book is concerned with what is studied within yeshivas, who the students are, life in the yeshiva, status and deviance, and choosing marriage partners and preparing for a career while in the yeshiva. A reviewer should try to be kind to an author whose book he is review- ing. If he can't be kind he must be fair. I find it impossible to be kind to an author who writes: "I was raised as an Orthodox Jew and attended several advanced yeshivas. . . . as a result I ... spoke Hebrew and Yiddish fluently" (p. 332; emphasis added); or says of an unnamed yeshiva that "ideologically it is somewhere between Beth Medrash Govoha of Lakewood and Yeshiva University's RIETS division" (p. 334; a statement comparable to saying that an American state is located somewhere between New York and Cali- fornia); or discussing the literature on Orthodoxy in America says, "in the</page><page sequence="2">138 BOOK REVIEWS popular area there is only one work, William B. Helmreich. . . " (p. 360; cit- ing a previous book by himself); or misleads the reader with the comment that "anyone who undertakes Talmudic study must be familiar with the Bible, for this is the basis for all discussion in the Talmud" (p. 99 and also p. 291). Since I cannot be kind I will try very hard to be fair. The book does have redeeming features. They do not include the historical introduction, which is a gross oversimplification bordering on distortion. This is not a light matter. Over and beyond the injury to the uninformed reader - e.g., Johanan ben Zakkai established a yeshiva at Yavneh, according to Helmreich (p. 2) - one cannot understand the Lithuanian yeshiva world-view without under- standing Reb Haim of Volozhin's metaphysical conception of "learning," which dominated the Lithuanian yeshiva world. Lamm and Etkes, both missing from the footnotes, are most helpful in this regard. A second general weakness of the book is the absence of an adequate basis with which to compare the American yeshiva. If we are to understand the American yeshiva, we must understand it on its own terms, which means, at least in part, to see what is American about it and how it has changed over the last few decades. The purpose of the exercise is not to understand, for example, Israeli yeshivas or the history of yeshivas but to find a handle by which we can understand the American yeshiva today. In the absence of such comparisons the reader will implicitly compare the yeshiva and the world with which he is familiar; e.g., other educational insti- tutions and/or the non-yeshiva Jewish world, and/or even the home from which the yeshiva student comes. Helmreich makes these comparisons expli- cit. They are legitimate, but they aren't enough. For example, the most strik- ing contrast between Israeli and American yeshivas is the latter's openness to all sorts of outside influences. (The term "open" is a deliberate one because that is the expression used by many in the yeshiva world itself.) But one would never know this from Helmreich, where the American yeshiva world emerges as an essentially closed institution, which, of course, it is when compared to the non-yeshiva world. This leads me to my next comment. I don't believe Helmreich is a very sensitive observer. The strength of the book, and it does have strengths, stems from the author's view from the inside. But he often doesn't ask the right questions (a good many of his informants could certainly have com- pared American and Israeli yeshivas or American yeshivas today and yester- day), and he isn't always sensitive to his own data. For example, he reports in the responses to his survey of yeshiva alumni that they have "an average</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 139 of 4.0 children per family compared to an average rate of 1.8 among Jews in general" (p. 310). The figure 4.0 has some significance in comparison to 1.8 but far greater significance because it suggests some measure of family plan- ning, a sore and sensitive subject within the yeshiva world which touches the nitty-gritty of religious observance and halakhic interpretation from the perspective of that world. In my opinion there are a number of other areas, such as wedding and funeral ceremonies or holiday celebrations, which would have been worth examining and from which a sensitive observer might formulate a more accurate image of the yeshiva-world perspective. I noted that the yeshiva must be understood on its own terms. But I think that some issues require presentation from the perspective of an intel- lectual outsider, an objective scholar. There are philosophical and social questions about Orthodoxy and the yeshiva world which an intelligent reader wants posed and analyzed in the language of intellectual discourse, not in the formulations of the yeshiva world. In other words, if the yeshiva world is to be understood, certain sets of questions must be raised and the author must get beyond the formulations of his respondents in order to analyze what they really believe or really do. I missed this kind of analysis (sometimes I even missed the question) with respect to such issues as: How does the yeshiva world picture reality? How does it view non-Jews, non- Orthodox Jews, non-yeshiva-world Jews, and how do men view women? Are these elements core components in its conception of reality, and if not, what are the core components? What is secular knowledge, and what does knowledge independent of Torah mean? What is the meaning and signifi- cance of the Land of Israel and the State of Israel? How is the Talmud taught and studied, and in what way is the yeshiva-world method distinctive from that applied in universities? Why has there been a proliferation in the number of yeshivas rather than absolute growth in the size of a few major yeshivas? What is the dynamic that impedes the growth in size of virtually all but not quite all the yeshivas? With all its faults the book does offer the reader entree into the world of the yeshiva. The author is at his best in his portrayal of the beginning stu- dent and weakest in his examination of the life of the advanced students, those "learning" in Kollelim (which, by the way, didn't reach their "zenith in this country" [p. 259], as anyone familiar with the Israeli yeshiva world knows). The final chapter, "Why Has the Yeshiva Survived?" is also of interest. Helmreich provides a checklist of factors, which include leadership, the character of the immigrant generation, changing attitudes toward cultural</page><page sequence="4">140 BOOK REVIEWS identification, the role of the American Jewish community, the day school movement, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and such social- psychological explanations as intellectual satisfaction and spiritual happi- ness. I don't think all these factors are relevant, and those that are ought to be organized in some kind of framework, since they are of different orders of explanation. But the discussion of each factor itself is of interest and helpful in understanding American Orthodoxy. If I were asked to summarize con- cisely the attraction of the yeshiva, I would point to its charisma. In elitist Orthodox Lithuanian conceptions, the yeshiva is where the real source and center of Judaism is to be found, where one comes in touch with the real Power and with what is really meaningful in life. The yeshiva is not only an institution or an instrument through which one finds Torah (meaning God and authentic Judaism), it is the locus of Torah. If I am correct, then this is the message that should have come through sharply and clearly in a book described as an effort to explain the drawing power of the yeshiva. I found the message blurred. A number of excellent studies of new religious groups have recently appeared. They require participant observation and overcoming suspicion. Their theoretical formulations rely primarily on the sociology of religion and sometimes on organizational theory. They tap historical sources. At their best they not only analyze the social and religious behavior of the parti- cipants but tie their observations into the broader cultural patterns of the societies out of which the new religions emerge and the ethos that informs them. They enrich our understanding of the group studied and of our own culture. We should insist on no less from students of contemporary Judaism. Charles S.
