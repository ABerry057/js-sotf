To his discussion should be added the remarks of Saul Lieberman, in an article entitled "mra, Charity, Alms," Journal of Biblical Literature 65 (1946): 69-72. There Lieberman brings considerable evidence for iVroh'j in this special usage in early Christian literature. He also shows there that a similar semantic development took place in the case of the Hebrew word mmy (and its Aramaic equivalents), which came likewise to mean "alms, charity." (See further his note apud Leviticus Rabba, ed. Mordecai Margulies [Jerusalem, 1958], pt. 4, p. 870 to line 56.) 2. aKiTrrTp In Le musion 89 (1976): 320-22, Drescher noted the rare form KbIrTWP (=iaKtiTrrp=exceptor), which he finds in Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, De ceremoniis aulae Byzantinae (Patrologia Graeca, 113: 322) and in Coptic. This form was already conjectured by Albert Thumb in his important article entitled "Die Griechischen Lehnworter im Armenischen," in Byzantinische 205</page><page sequence="2">206 DANIEL SPERBER Zeitschrift 9 (1900): 435, on the basis of the Armenian skeptor (13th-14th centuries). This unusual form is also to be found in a rabbinic source, in Pesiqta de Rab Kahana, Ha-HIodesh 12, ed. Bernard Mandelbaum (New York, 1962), p. 102: R. Hoshaya [early 3rd cent. C.E.] taught: the earthly court [beit din] ruled and said that the day was New Year's Day (rosh ha-shanah), [and] the Lord says to the ministering angels: Set up a platform (bfma), and let the advocates (pl,2'2,o=uvvinyop+pl. ending) stand, and let the Tlni"tSpo stand [and announce] that the earthly court has declared the day to be New Year's Day. But if the witness tarried in coming [and hence the court could not declare the day to be New Year, since their decision depends upon the eyewitness statements as to the state of the New Moon], or the court decided to lengthen the year [by a day], thus making New Year's Day the morrow, the Lord Blessed be He says to the ministering angels: Remove the bema, and the advocates, and let the lpl1opo be removed, for the earthly court has declared that tomorrow is New Year's Day. Why so? "For this is a statute for Israel, and a law for the God of Jacob" (Ps. 81:5). The variant readings noted by Mandelbaum in his edition (ad loc.) are: c 'Dpv, I'llnpl . To this we may add Midrash ha-Gadol, Exodus 12.1, ed. Mordecai Margulies (Jerusalem, 1956), p. 169, lines 6, 8: 1,apDo (read: ,rnpo) and ptDp~. The manuscript evidence is overwhelming. Clearly we have before us the word aidrKrwp. However, its meaning is more than simply "a scribe," or even one "specially attached to the magistrates."' For in the context of our passage the sceptor seems to play a more significant role, even announcing the final outcome of the litigation, the verdict. It is true that Mandelbaum (note, ad loc.) suggested emending to 71,iipo =scriptor=scribe. Here he was following a suggestion made by Israel B6hmer in his Kezad Maarichin2 in 1885. However, the emendation is 1. See, e.g., Alexander Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin (Oxford, 1949) col. 134a, s.v. "exceptor." See also Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictonary of Roman Law (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, n.s. 43 [1953]): 461, s.v. "exceptor." 2. Israel B6hmer, Kezad Maarichin, oder Beitrdge zur Chalddisch-Rabbinischen Lexico- graphie (Berlin, 1885), p. 4. We should mention that the correct etymology was alread noted by most of the major rabbinic dictionaries. See Jacob Levy, Neuhebrdisches und Chalddisches Worterbuch aber die Talmud und Midraschim, 4 vols. (Leipzig, 1883), 3: 582a, Aruch Com- pletum, ed. Alexander Kohut, 8 vols.

Furthermore, a simple scriptor would not rightfully fulfill the duties demanded of our functionary. Now, one of the Coptic sources that Drescher adduces gives a slightly different picture of the sceptor. Severus of Antioch, Eulogy of St. Leontinus3: I shall stand before Pilate in your court, enduring the shouts of the praecones and cursores, while the sceptores call out, taking the apologiae. Apparently, the sceptores not only wrote out the apologia4 (usually the speech of the defense), but also announced it. In our text, too, we have a description of the proceedings at a court of law, with its f3t)ta--"a permanent elevated platform to serve as a seat of the judge"5-and its advocates. Apparently, the issue at stake is whether the earthly court has the right to make such calendric decisions. The judge summons his court, and the kategorin (not mentioned here) contest the legi- timate rights of the earthly court in this matter, while the synegorin defend it. The judge decides in favor of the defendant (the earthly court), and scep- tores declare the earthly court's decision upheld. And if the earthly court decides later to change its decision, the divine court also endorses this change, canceling its earlier ruling and the public declaring of the sceptores. We see then that our two sets of sources not only bear one another out on the philological level, but also supplement each other on the contextual level. rashic Literature (New York, 1903), col. 1020a; Samuel Krauss, Griechische und Lateinische Lehnw6rter im Talmud, Midrasch und Talmud (Berlin, 1899; reprint ed., Hildesheim, 1964) 2: 410b. See also Nehemiah Briill, Jahrbuch fir Jiidische Geschichte und Literatur 1 (1874): 178. However none of these authorities remarked on this specific form SKEPTOR and EXCEPTOR, a contracted form of ?KKyTrrTwp or jKTTrrwp (exceptor), nor did they note the specialized meaning of the word (see below). See further Michael Sachs, Beitraege zur Sprach- und Alterthumsforschung (Berlin, 1852), 1: 170, who suggests reading l~tn5pbo (read: prnt5,po) =speculatores; Julius Fiirst, Glossarium Graeco-Hebraeum (Strassburg, 1890) pp. 159-60 and 197, citing, inter alia, Moritz Giade- mann's suggestion to read prvpo= avKoO&amp;tvrat; and Yosef ben Benyamin Dov Sch6nhak, Sefer ha-mashbir ('o he-'Arukh he-badash) (Warsaw, 1868), 2: 38b, suggesting KiKTrrpov. These may all be readily rejected. 3. James Drescher, Le museon 89 (1976): 320. 4. Ibid.: Pilate took the apologia of the Saviour written by the sceptores as for a robber. 5.

This meaning, hitherto unnoticed, may be seen to appear in a rabbinic source too. (Genesis Rabbah 11:4, ed. Julius Theodor and Chanoch Albeck [Berlin-Jerusalem, 1903; 2d ed., Jerusalem, 1965]): Said R. Hiyya b. Abba [flourished circa 270-310]: Once a certain person in Laodicea invited me [to his house] and brought before me a prie borne on fifteen poles, and in it (n1i) [was something] of everything that had been created in the six days of creation. And in the center was a child who called out loud, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1). Why so? So that the owner should not become overproud. I asked him, "My son, whence have you been graced with all this honor [i.e., wealth]?" He replied, "I used to be a butcher [or: a meat dresser], and every animal considered good I would set aside for the Sabbath."6 The reading trpizin is found in the 'Arukh s.v. T'rpiv, ed. Alexander Kohut (New York, 1955), 4: 936, and was translated in some versions by the word tInk, "table." So too in MS Paris 149 of Genesis Rabba (cited in the apparatus, p. 91 to line 3), which has ait v Irn Inh*V-a table of gold, and also in B.T. Shabbat 169a: ant Sav Tnh.7 However, the meaning table is somewhat problematic: tables are not generally made out of gold, and nor- mally one does not put food in a table (11) but rather on it (ir95). However, an alternative reading, found in a group of sources has, in place of trpizin, the word diskos-o-lpjnT (with slight variations in readings).8 This, of course, corresponds to the Greek biaKos, and here means "a large dish or salver."' We would therefore suggest that trpizin too (= rpair&amp;tov, diminutive of rpdirf'a)'0 here means "a tray." Indeed, the (albeit later) recension of this text in the Pesiqta Rabbati, chap. 23," has the Greek word 6. Parallels: B.T. Shabbat 119a; Pesiqta Rabbati, chap. 23, ed.

The word thaw, which we have already seen appearing in later recensions of this text (e.g., B.T. Shabbat and the 'Arukh), is a translation of the word trapezin, in its more common meaning. We may further note that the word trpizin is here used much as it is in the Coptic sources that Drescher cited. It is of silver or gold, and so, too, in the Coptic sources'2 it is of silver or gold." The Coptic sources suggest that it may (at times) have been richly decorated, studded with jewels,'4 while some rabbinic traditions likewise suggest that it was ornamented.'5 We see then that in the two parallel traditions of this Genesis Rabbah text we find two different words,'6 presumably very similar in meaning: rpariLtov-biUKor. This may serve to give additional credence to Drescher's conjectures at the conclusion of his discussion. There he writes: "In the above passages the TPAHEZA is coupled with HOTHPION. Among the sacred vessels none goes more closely with the irortptov, the chalice which holds the wine of the sacrifice, than the biTKor, the paten, which holds the bread. The word AICKOC occurs rarely in Sahidic Coptic. I believe that its place was taken by TPAHEZA with the meaning paten, tray, dish."''7 Our "equation," 7pairidtov-- Kos, may constitute a further link in Drescher's argument. 12.
