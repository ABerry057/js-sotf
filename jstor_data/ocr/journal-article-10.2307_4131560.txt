<plain_text><page sequence="1">Uriel Simon. The JPS Bible Commentary: Jonah. Philadelphia: JPS, 1999. xliii, 52 pp. The JPS Torah/Bible Commentary series has already produced some excep- tional commentaries that have immensely enriched biblical scholarship, and Uriel Simon's Jonah commentary is a worthy addition to this series. He concludes that the Book of Jonah was composed during the Second Temple period, mainly be- cause of the late Hebrew language, but he does not find sufficient grounds to de- cide between a sixth-, fifth-, or even fourth-century date. Nor does Simon believe that the book offers evidence for reconstructing a particular social-political con- text that would help to define a special target audience. He concludes that, like the Book of Job, which was also composed in the Second Temple period and which also featured non-Jews among its cast of characters, the Book of Jonah was writ- ten during a period in which theodicy was a dominant concern within the Jewish community. Simon begins with a search for the dominant theme/issue that the Book of 117</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review Jonah addresses, reviewing the four traditional interpretive answers to this puz- zle (atonement vs. repentance, universalism vs. particularism, prophecy realiza- tion vs. compliance, and justice vs. mercy). Although the best-known figures within the Jewish interpretive tradition seem to be rather evenly spread among the four-some opting for combinations among them-Simon gives what he be- lieves to be convincing arguments against the first three proposed answers. His decisive argument is that none of the first three themes is addressed in all parts of the story. Only the fourth theme-justice vs. mercy-accomplishes that (al- though Simon has to admit that it would have covered all four chapters much more clearly had 1:3 included something like " . . . to flee from the presence of the Lord, for he said in his heart, 'I know that the Lord is compassionate and gra- cious, slow to anger, etc.'"). Although Simon makes an exceptionally strong case that "justice vs. mercy" is the dominant theme, he does not convince this re- viewer that the other themes must somehow be subordinate to it. For example, one could argue that the "universalism vs. particularism" theme runs more con- sistently through every part of the story. Moreover, in a literary classic why can- not all four of these themes have an equal claim to the reader's attention, even if some are more developed in some parts of the story than in others? One cannot assume that great writers begin their compositions by settling on a theme and then clothing it with a story. Simon makes a near-convincing case that Jonah's prayer in 2:3-10 was in- corporated into the story at a later time. It was common to add songs and prayers into already-composed stories during the Second Temple period (e.g., 2 Kgs. 20:2; Isa. 3 8:9-20; LXX of Esther 4:17 and Daniel 3:23). Jonah's prayer, moreover, does not fit smoothly into its narrative context. With our prophet in the belly of a great fish, we should have a prayer of entreaty rather than of thanksgiving. Further, if the prayer were part of the original story, we should expect Jonah's repentance to accompany his vow to sacrifice after his safe return. Some later editor must have incorporated the psalm into the story, Simon believes, primarily because of its ref- erence to drowning. This leaves the interpreter with two options: (a) reading 2:3- 10 as a freestanding prayer that depicts a worshipper who was lost (drowning in Sheol) but who has found redemption (returned to God's temple), and (b), reading Jonah's psalm as part of the story. Although his heart does not seem to be in it, Si- mon chooses (b), (he must transform many perfects and waw-consecutive imper- fects into Prophetic futures in order to make the psalm cohere with the narrative). Now we see that, although he still hasn't repented, the silent prophet of ch. I has a lively faith that comes through as "no whit inferior to the idolaters of the crew" (p. 16). In fact, the anti-pagan polemic in 2:9-10 may be showing us that Jonah is superior to the crew (!). Simon asserts that "any reconciliation of the psalm and the story obscures the unique meaning of each... " (p. 16). Agreed! Combining the two does indeed create an entirely different work of literature; and when one reads the plain mean- ing of the psalm, the resulting dissonance with the narrative framework produces satiric effects. Rather than risking interpreting the entire story based on the plain meaning of the psalm, however, Simon's attempted reconciliation (option b, above) 118</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews forces the psalm to fit in smoothly with the rest of the story. He has thus given the psalm "second-class citizenship" in the Tanakh, and such an approach-long a part of the historical-critical method-must be challenged. If almost every book of the Tanakh is the result of a literary tradition that has evolved over many cen- turies, by what right does a scholar state that one part of the tradition (the so-called "original author," for example) trumps later parts within the same text? Who, for example, is the "original author" of the Book of Genesis, and what parts of the text must then be given second-class status (e.g., Gen. 14 or 24)? Or, if a later schol- arly consensus should some day decide that Jon. 4:6-11 was added secondarily, should the commentaries then disregard or downplay the Lord's lesson with the plant as contributing to the meaning of the tale? Since giving the psalm first-class status would bring the story's genre close to satire, Simon's approach could be justified if there were a general scholarly con- sensus that the story is virtually devoid of irony; but such a consensus is lacking. Simon admits that there is some irony in the story, but it is gentle and forgiving- far removed from satire and "irreverent jesting." In fact, however, his reading of the story comes through as rather straitlaced, as we see in the following instances where Simon sees no irony or satire: (a) It is pathos, not irony, when the ship cap- tain confronts the sleeping prophet who remains silent, despite the crew's efforts and the captain's appeal; (b) Jonah's request to be thrown overboard is an example of his "moral grandeur" in saving the crew rather than a continuation of his self- isolation and death wish that run throughout the story; (c) There is nothing risible about Jonah's being vomited (qy') back onto dry land (but cf. Prov. 26:11; Isa. 28:8; and esp. Jer. 48:26, where those who wallow in their vomit become laughing- stocks); (d) The scorn for idolaters in 2:9-10 (the interpretation of which Simon bases on Ps. 31:7-8, which begins "I detest those who rely on empty folly") is a glorification of the Lord rather than self-exaltation or a put-down of the nonbe- lievers; (e) Jonah must have spoken more than five words in effecting such an amazing turnaround in Nineveh, even though Simon had earlier concluded that there was little attempt to give the story a realistic dimension; (f) Moses (Num. 11:15) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:4-5) request death when their prophetic leadership appears to be threatened. Thus Jonah's request for death in 4:3,8 elevates him to their level, despite his having just achieved the greatest success of any prophet; and (g) Just as Jacob's silence in response to Levi and Simeon's rebuke over Dinah's rape indicates his assent (Gen. 34:31, but cf. 49:5-7!), Jonah's silence at the end of the story indicates that he agrees with God's viewpoint. This review has focused on points of disagreement, but I have learned so much from this commentary. For example, whereas most Jonah commentaries are full of "cf."s that refer the reader to allusions and parallel passages, no one has done a better job of plumbing meaning through a sensitive exploration of the ties not only to Jeremiah, Elijah, etc., but also between the chs. 1-2 and chs. 3-4 par- allels within the story itself. Simon is at his best in his interpretation of ch. 4, where he convincingly shows that the tone never goes above gentle irony. I still believe that chs. 1-3 are replete with satirical elements, but the story has such a "soft land- ing" that I wonder whether it can be designated as satire, when taken as a whole. 119</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review Despite the methodological questions I have raised regarding Simon's com- mentary, it is surely a book that belongs on the shelf of every biblical scholar.
