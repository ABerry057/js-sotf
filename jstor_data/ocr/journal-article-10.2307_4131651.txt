<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Davis. Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller: Portrait ofa Seventeenth-Century Rabbi. Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. xii, 302 pp. The biography of a well-chosen rabbinic figure tells much more than simply the life of an individual; it opens up diverse facets of Jewish life in a given time 203</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and place. It also sheds light on the histories of a number of communities because, alas, it was (and is) the lot of many a communal rabbi-even those of the first rank -to be kicked around from place to place. Joseph Davis has chosen well in focusing on Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, a man who lived during an age of significant developments in both Jewish and general society and who served in Nikolsburg, Vienna, and Prague before moving to Poland, where he was the rabbi of a small community, then a larger town, and still later, the largest Jewish community of the region, Cracow. In the course of telling Heller' s life story, Davis describes Heller's reception of the scientific advances suggested by his contemporaries, Tycho Brache and Johannes Kepler, in Prague and how Heller struggled with the introduction of Kabbalah into northern Europe. Heller also had to confront the theosophic and pedagogic innovations of his teacher, Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the Maharal of Prague. Davis wisely uses Heller as a foil to discuss the long-term influence-or lack thereof-of the Maharal's views. Heller's own writings, par- ticularly his commentaries on Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel's code of law and Rabbi Moses Isserles's Torat ha-hata 'at, are first used to show Heller's opposition to the use of the relatively new Shulhan 'arukh and then his ultimate acceptance of the new code. One of Davis's most important sources for Heller's life is Megilat 'eivah, Heller's own account of his imprisonment and subsequent deliverance in Vienna, as well as his brush with the authorities in Wlodomierz (Ludmir). Although Davis uses the material with great personal sensitivity, the methodologi- cal problems of dealing with an autobiography are hardly discussed and, when they are, it is only very late in the book. Davis notes that Megilat 'eivah exists in Yiddish and Hebrew versions and that "each version, each language, has its own silences" (196). This cries out for some discussion of the texts as historical sources. This question becomes even more compelling in reading through Davis's listing of Heller's works. Here, Davis notes that there are a number of manuscripts in both languages, yet the earliest manuscript copy dates from more than a century after Heller's death (228). What language did Heller himself write in? In one instance, Davis notes that Heller wrote the Yiddish version of Megilat 'eivah (148); however, Davis gleans information from both textual traditions without clarifying which tradition should be privileged over the other. Though he is aware that Heller did not include certain information (195-96), Davis seems to accept much of what is said in Megilat 'eivah at face value (see, for example, 139-40). Granted, there may be no other extant source regarding the events, but there must be an ongoing recognition of the problematics of using a one-sided story, and efforts must be made to compensate. Davis notes the importance of presenting "a balanced and rounded view of the subject's life, placing him in the context of a time, a place, and a com- munity" (1-2) and he does this well with respect to Heller's views toward Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah. Although it is possible to dispute Davis's position on the place of philosophy in fifteenth and early sixteenth-century Ashkenazic society at large, he is undoubtedly correct in noting that by the 204</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews early seventeenth-century, Kabbalah had displaced philosophical study in eastern Europe. Davis labels Heller "the last medieval Jew" (15). To make this claim stick, it is necessary to examine Heller's legal writings to see how he used his sources and what place, if any, he assigned works from the Sephardic world, particularly Mai- monides, who was not a favorite of late medieval Ashkenazic rabbis such as Rabbi Israel Isserlein. If Heller cleaved to the classical works of medieval Ashkenaz, such as the Tosafot and Rabbi Moses of Coucy's Sefer mizvot gadol, then he was a disciple of the past. If he was open to the views of rabbis from other regions that printing had helped make available, then he may not have been such a "medieval" after all. Unfortunately, there are a number of historical points made in the course of the book that are misleading, if not incorrect. For example, on page 218, Davis discusses the case of "a certain Jew" who "had converted to Christianity out of fear and possibly constraint. Now safe in Cracow, he came to the ghetto and wished to return to Judaism. Paying little heed to the talmudic principles involved in the case, the rabbis of Cracow, with Heller at their head, turned the refugee away. The Cracow Jews were patient; they were waiting for the new Polish monarch, Jan Casimir, to grant a general permission for converted Jews to return to Judaism, as he did in 1649 and 1650." Leaving aside the fact that there was no Jewish ghetto in contemporary Cracow, Davis is mistaken in his reading of the source, a responsum of Rabbi Nathan Kahana of Ostrog. Kahana's responsum (no. 54) deals with the case of a Jew who apostatized of his own accord and then decided to return to Judaism, an act that endangered the local community. Kahana discussed the matter at length and at the end of his responsum, he dealt with the question of whether a community can turn an innocent person over to idolaters even if it is known that he will be forced to apostatize. Kahana noted in the very place cited by Davis (243 in the responsum), "and so I saw in the great and holy community of Cracow, that they turned over a school child (tinok mi-beyt ha-sefer) to the hands of the Gentiles who said give us that very child for idolatry." The piece is not dated, but the responsa in the collection are sequential and based on the position of responsum no. 54, it would seem that Kahana was writing between 1644 and 1648. Heller became the chief rabbi of Cracow late in the winter of 1644 (192). Kahana specifically wrote that the case of the schoolboy was some- thing that he had seen in Cracow. Kahana had been rabbi of Lubmol from 1628, rabbi of Przemy'l from 1631, and of Ostrog from 1637. He was not a rabbi in Cracow when Heller was there. Perhaps Kahana had traveled to Cracow in the interim, but it is equally possible that he was reflecting on an earlier time in his life. We do not know. More troubling to Davis's point, Kahana made no reference to a Jew in Cracow who "had converted to Christianity out of fear," made no mention of this schoolboy wanting to return to Judaism, and, to make matters worse from a historiographic point of view, the authorities in Cracow did not turn the boy away, they gave him away! The idea that the community showed patience in this case and waited for King Jan Casimir's permission for Jews specifically converted to Greek Orthodoxy during 1648-49 to return to Judaism 205</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews is not only irrelevant, it is unfounded. In short, a misreading fabricates an event in the life of the Jewish community of Cracow and its rabbi, Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller. Elsewhere, Davis implies that Rabbi Joel Sirkes was not opposed to the pur- chasing of rabbinic positions and suggests that after Sirkes's death, Heller, who was vehemently opposed to the practice, may have felt freer to pursue those who had bought their way into the rabbinate. However, the material that Davis cites only tells us Sirkes's position regarding a rabbi receiving a salary and gifts (see 186 n. 42); he makes no mention of purchasing the rabbinate. To argue that Sirkes was not opposed to purchasing the rabbinate is, at very best, an argument from silence and, even if admitted (and I do not think that it should be), it cannot be the basis for further assumptions. This is a sympathetic biography of Heller, but that does not prevent Davis from examining some of Heller's failures as a rabbi-and that is how it should be. This is also a sympathetic review, but it does not exempt the reviewer from examining some of Davis's missteps as a biographer of a very important rabbi.
