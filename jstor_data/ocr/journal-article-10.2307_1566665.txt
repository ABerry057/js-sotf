New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997. xvi, 270 pp. This is not a scholarly reading of the Tractatus Theologico-politicus, despite appearances to the contrary. It is a polemical attack fueled by quasi-inquisitorial</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS' 125 zeal and as such reveals far more about the tenor of our times, its Zeitgeist, than it contributes to our understanding of Spinoza. It makes urgent the question of what we can learn about ourselves from this and other recent instances of the renewal of the historic vilification of Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-politicus. Each era seems to dredge Spinoza up from some subterranean Jewish deep, projecting upon him reflections of its own hopes and fears--a phenomenon Spinoza himself would have had a heyday analyzing. Steven Smith has provided us with a wonderful litmus of our times. He constructs Spinoza as a straw man to mount an attack on political liberalism in general and on liberal Judaism in particular. "The Treatise," Smith writes (p. xviii), "represents the first and most profound expression of the Jewish liberal symbiosis that has survived [sic] to the present." The central claim of Spinoza, Liberalism and the Question ofJewish Identity is that Spinoza's Tractatus was the first modern political theory to put the "Jewish Question" at the heart of its analysis, and that the purpose of the work was to call for the replacement of Judaism with a completely secular democratic republic where people would be completely rational and autonomous. In other words, Smith maintains that Spinoza called for the annihilation of Judaism in the name of democracy. ("With Spinoza begins that line of distinctly modern thought which holds that Jews can be free not only [sic] when they have been granted freedom of religion but also [sic] when they have been emancipated from Judaism" [p. 25].) And thus Smith blames Spinoza for (what Smith claims was) his advocacy of a liberal democratic state dependent for its very existence and survival upon religious and ethnic leveling, and hence he also blames Spinoza for Jewish assimilationism (p. 200). Smith's aim is to write Spinoza out of Judaism and the Jewish canon as the great enemy of Jewish survival and continuity, and in doing so to deal a blow as well to modem liberal democracy. "Spinoza's treatment of the theologico-political problem," Smith writes (p. 13), "is important because it tells us something about the nature and limits of liberalism"; it "forces us today to reconsider what is sometimes called the Enlightenment project" (p. xiii). Steven Smith's Spinoza is a straw man from two perspectives. First, Smith sets up a highly tendentious version of Spinoza's thought that in most significant respects is beyond the pale of prevailing responsible scholarly opinion, and second, he does not even bother to argue textually for his version but simply asserts it and expands upon it, offering extensive elaborations of the context but not of the texts.</page><page sequence="3">126 BOOK REVIEWS Let us begin with Smith's contention that Spinoza in the Tractatus is centrally concerned with the Jewish Question, for upon this claim the book's arguments rest. The Jewish Question, Smith admits (p. 13), is a term coined in the nineteenth century to refer to "the terms by which Jews, after centuries of separation and ghettoization, would be granted the rights of membership in, or admission to, the polity." Despite this terminological anachronism, Smith maintains that the "Jewish Question was the main theme of Spinoza's reflections from early on," and that "Spinoza made the Jewish Question an essential ingredient of modem political thought." Moreover, "Spinoza put Jewish concerns and problems at the forefront of his thought in order to exercise a profound transformation of them. ... It was an attempt to turn Judaism from an authoritative body of revealed law into what today would be called a modem secular identity" (p. xiii). Nowhere in the book does Smith provide any textual evidence, any rereading of significant passages, to lend support to this highly implausible and somewhat perverse claim. As any student of the Tractatus knows, Spinoza rarely mentions postbiblical Judaism in the text, even more rarely mentions contemporary Jews, and only occasionally cites postbiblical Jewish sources and never systematically but only in passing. Thus one must conclude that Smith is implicitly maintaining that Spinoza, in his proposed principles of biblical hermeneutics and in his rereading of the Hebrew Bible-a scripture common and holy to Jews and to many Christian communities (from Catholic to Quaker) in the seventeenth-century Dutch republic-is, in fact, only pretending to address the Bible per se but instead intends his arguments as a reinterpretation and transformation of contemporary Judaism. But this surely cannot be the case, for Spinoza not only offers a reading and biblical hermeneutic applicable to the Hebrew Bible but also extends his rereading to the New Testament, applying his hermeneutic to both. Moreover, Smith maintains that the text proposes a transformation of Judaism despite the additional obvious objection that Jews were expressly prohibited from reading the Tractatus by the terms of Spinoza's excommunication. And Smith even admits both the timelessness of the work and also its Dutch Protestant, politically republican audience (pp. 44, 54). Perhaps, then, Smith merely means by his claim that the Tractatus addresses the Jewish Question that Spinoza is addressing the problem of religious tolerance by trying to conceptualize and make a plea for a new type of polity in which citizenship is granted, without prejudice, to members of all religious groups, the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 127 Jews being the most difficult case. But such an enterprise could not focus on the transformation of Judaism as its central project, as Smith maintains, but would instead have to address essentially the narrowness of the religion of the dominant group, namely, the Calvinist orthodoxy, and only incidentally, or by extension, Judaism. Moreover, that Spinoza would be aiming at the transformation of Judaism could not be reconciled with full freedom of thought, another aim of the treatise, if Jews were to be the objects but not the subjects of their own religious transformation. It would seem that Smith is conflating aspects of the influence of the Tractatus upon later Jewish thinkers with the intentions of Spinoza himself in the work. This is certainly how we must understand Smith's citing of Hermann Cohen in support of his own interpretation of the exoteric (!), in contrast with the esoteric, meaning of the text: "Spinoza's professed intention to liberate his readers from prejudice is in reality an attempt to liberate them from Judaism. His biblical criticism is of the Jewish Bible only" (p. 55)-a claim Cohen surely knew (even if Smith apparently does not) to be literally false, if true in some sense to the influence of Spinoza upon later German Jews. Steven Smith's careless and systematically biased interpretation of the Tractatus can, I believe, be explained by two pervasive scholarly weaknesses. First, Smith reads Spinoza via later Jewish thinkers (Cohen, Levinas, Fackenheim) who, strongly opposed to him philosophically and religiously, took him on without any intention of providing an unbiased and complete account of what he actually said; their purposes was to combat a pervasive and amorphous Spinozism among modernizing Jews as much as, or even more than, the actual philosophy of Spinoza. Smith justifies this interpretation of the text by a self-serving, circular deployment of a Straussian claim to an exoteric/esoteric division in the text. Second, and this is also a fatal problem, Smith systematically shuns the Ethics and as a result falls into interpretations of the Tractatus that are glaringly implausible to anyone who has some facility with Spinoza's rigorous philosophic thought. Smith is simply wrong when he maintains (and follows as a methodological principle) the complete independence of the Tractatus from the Ethics. "Spinoza did not develop his understanding of politics from a set of metaphysical premises independently derived; instead he developed it from a study of biblical narrative and history" (p. xv). One simply cannot determine which layers of the text of the Tractatus assuage popular sensibilities and which embody a true rational standpoint</page><page sequence="5">128 BOOK REVIEWS without knowing the Ethics. And thus Smith makes the astounding claim that Spinoza's principle of the separation of reason and theology mandates a hard-and- fast distinction, "anticipating Kant," between a practical reason operative in moral and political affairs which is under discussion in the Tractatus and a purely theoretical scientific reason which is the subject of the Ethics (p. 82). Nothing could be further from the truth, as any student of the Ethics knows, and as the work's very title betrays. Spinoza's claim of the identity of body and mind (El p1), affect and idea (E3 General Definition of the Emotions), makes impossible, according to any plausible interpretation, the transcendence of theoretical from practical concerns, of thinking from desire---"Desire is the very essence of man," Spinoza says (E3 Definition of the Emotions 1). And thus the Tractatus cannot be, as Smith maintains, a book about practical reason and the Ethics a book about a purely theoretical reason because the two are not separable according to any of the standard or even plausible readings of Spinoza's philosophy. Thus the central philosophic claim of Spinoza, Liberalism and the Question ofJewish Identity--that the Tractatus narrates the triumph of the progress of practical reason over the authority of ancient tradition (pp. 83, 87)--fails. Smith seems to be driven by an image of Spinoza as "betray[er] of an ancient tradition" (p. xviii) and the "defiler of Judaism" (p. 17). It is simply not true that "Spinoza does not cease from carrying out a scathing attack on Judaism" (p. 17) or even on the Hebrew Bible. (See, e.g., Spinoza's description of the ancient Hebrew republic as, at its inception, a perfect model democracy, in TTP, 17.) Smith's understanding of Judaism is flat and unnuanced (see, e.g., pp. 99, 204) and at times simply mistaken (e.g., his suggestion that the reward for obedience to the mitzvot is immortality, p. 99), as is his interpretation of Maimonides' doctrine of prophecy ("Spinoza's naturalistic reduction of prophecy and prophetic knowledge to the facts of human psychology is clearly an attack on the canonical treatment of that subject by Maimonides" [p. 92, emphasis added]). Smith is also motivated by a postmodemist agenda: "The Jewish Question has haunted modernity ever since its inception. It remains the most vivid form of the Other, or human diversity, with which liberal society has labored to come to terms" (p. xiv). Spinoza is cast as the villain whose aim is to efface the Otherness of the Other as a sacrifice to liberal democracy. Yet there ought to be some discomfort for the postmodemist in waging an attack upon this icon of marginalization. Spinoza could just as well be cast as a</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 129 postmodern hero, for (as Lenn Goodman recently pointed out) he set out to heal the rupture of mind and body, reason and emotion, freedom and determinism, ideal and real. What Steven Smith has clearly shown, paradoxically, is that Spinoza continues to figure powerfully in Jewish consciousness and that his works are still alive enough to scandalize (or inspire) us. But how Jews and Judaism figure in Spinoza's political and general philosophic thought deserve better treatment than Steven Smith's Spinoza, Liberalism and the Question ofJewish Identity. Heidi M.
