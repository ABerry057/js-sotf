T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2001. 227 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001256 In this challenging and careful study of the political economy of later Roman northern Palestine, Hayim Lapin articulates important correctives to and con straints on current practices in the historical study of a much-contested region and its resident cultures. Lapin seeks to reframe the history of Roman Palestine as "a history of provincialization" (10) through "a focus on human geography as an aspect of provincial history" (12-13). Such a history, Lapin argues, could help dislodge the study "of Palestine, or of the land of Israel, or of the Holy Land, or of Eretz Israel" (11) from its present entanglement within numerous imposed "primordialities such as ethnicity, kinship, or religious affiliation" (9); within reigning dichotomies, including archaeological versus textual, historical versus literary, formalist versus substantivist, even Jew versus Gentile (7-8); and within categorical assumptions, such as those regarding "the autonomy and 404</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews naturalness of ancient Jews and Judaism as historical entities, as well as the pre sence of both on the landscape" (11). He lays the groundwork for this endeavor by carrying out a systematic analysis of hundreds of residential sites from the Galilee and Golan through the lens of "central place theory"?a social-scientific model developed in the early twentieth century and applied to historical and con temporary agrarian economies in order to analyze their geographic/spatial and social-organizational patterns in a way that also enables cross-cultural (historical and geographic) comparison. With characteristic scrupulousness and precision, Lapin proffers his detail-rich findings with the proviso that they "should not be confused with false claims to rigorous proof of historiographical hypotheses" and that "the resulting reconstruction of a late antique landscape is at once fictive and at the same time productive for a regional history of later Roman north ern Palestine" (8). And productive it is. Following an introduction that lays out the aims and organization of the book, Chapter 1 describes central-place theory and discusses its potential useful ness, as well as its real limitations, for understanding the social and economic history of later Roman Palestine. Here Lapin delineates a "set of concepts and models that can be used to suggest possible distributions of markets and marketing in later Roman Palestine" (30). The latter part of the chapter is devoted to explor ing a selection of Palestinian rabbinic texts in which Lapin finds strong echoes of the key concepts at the heart of his theoretical model. Chapter 2 provides a survey of the available archaeological data for sites in the Galilee and Golan. The material data are described with an eye to the nature of their collection, preservation, and publication and to the problems inherent in these processes?in particular, with regard to the range of methodologies, interpretive biases, and reporting standards represented in survey samples. Lapin 's description of the body of data as a whole is most significant for its honest exposure of the "pro foundly problematic" (43) nature of the data and, by implication, of some of the more extravagant claims made by some historians about economic and social con ditions in the region at a given time based on such survey data. Turning his focus to five particular regions that, despite the general problems discussed at the outset, offer a fair sense of population distribution throughout the Galilee and Golan, Lapin discusses these data sets in great depth with page after page of accompanying lists, charts, maps, and graphs. The data in aggregate, according to Lapin, suggest multiplication of settlements in late antiquity and offer some glimpse of settlement sizes, densities, and distribution. The chapter ends with a discussion of regional inte gration from this alternative perspective, in contrast to more common appeals to categories such as ethnicity, religion, and topography in assessing regionalism. Applying the theoretical model outlined in Chapter 1 to the data discussed in Chapter 2, Lapin undertakes in Chapter 3 a series of hypothetical reconstructions of central-place hierarchies in northern Palestine. In the pattern of the preceding chapters, this one begins with cautionary notes and an outline of the limits of tech nique, evidence, and results, stressing the hypothetical nature of the latter. The exercise is, nonetheless, quite useful, as it calls into question standard assumptions about differences between cities and villages?for example, with regard to access to trade goods and engagement in agriculture. Lapin also examines possible 405</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews patterns of economic relations between rural settlements and larger commercia lized sites, proposing solutions to some existing questions and raising other ques tions for further study. Chapter 4 turns to a sustained investigation of the ways in which marketing and geography are articulated in ancient Palestinian literature. Lapin reviews rab binic (Hebrew and Aramaic) literature as well as Christian and non- (or not specifi cally) Christian literature in Greek and Latin. In this second category we find excerpts ranging from Josephus's War and Life to the New Testament Gospels and Eusebius's Onomastikon. Not surprisingly, given the nature of the various lit eratures, the vast majority of texts discussed derive from the rabbinic corpus. The chapter looks at literary evidence for urban markets, rural marketing, fairs, pro fessional marketers, and consumer dependence on markets. Although no systema tic mapping of marketing practice is possible based on the literary evidence and little may be added directly from this part of the study to the earlier material data and hypothetical reconstructions ("As a 'test' or 'check' on the model, the textual evidence discussed here clearly fails" [151]), this work is intriguing in itself and valuable for other kinds of historical reconstructions. The concluding chapter of the book summarizes the preceding chapters before proposing a synthetic account of provincialization (or urbanizing "Roma nization") as the key political, economic, and cultural process shaping later Roman Palestine. By observing the growth of cities and their surrounding settle ments in relation to Roman administrative interventions, Lapin plots the trans formation of the Galilee "from doubly peripheral territory?the periphery of a client kingdom?to core territory, organized as a Roman province" (155). Indeed, cities, "the stuff of empire" (162), and the Roman roads connecting them came to shape?over time?local production, processing, trade, and market ing patterns as well. Text analysis makes a reappearance in this chapter as Lapin emphasizes that local "cultural" productions (such as rabbinic traditions) that are frequently characterized as responding to or in opposition to larger (imperial, "external") forces are, themselves, "in some very basic ways the product of the same historical processes" (176) to which they are customarily juxtaposed. In the end, Lapin 's study provides the reader, on one hand, with a vast amount of data and analysis along with an appropriate sense of caution and con straint such as has sometimes been sorely lacking in ancient Galilean studies. On the other hand, Lapin 's study lays a foundation and begins to sketch out a model for imagining a far more fully integrated history of Roman Palestine than has here tofore been attempted. In the face of sectarian historiography and popularized accounts of exploited peasantries, imperial excesses, and indigenous resistance movements, Lapin offers an erudite and potentially liberating glimpse?macro and micro?into a history of countless common provincials going about their lives and daily business in the very process of "becoming provincial." The scholarship carried out in this short (under 200 pages) volume is dense and can occasionally leave readers who are not wonks or enthusiastic number crunchers rubbing their eyes and massaging their temples. From start to finish, Lapin eschews any strong claims and declines to paint an engaging picture or formulate an ideologically appealing narrative. Although these traits might deny 406</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews it the wide attention it deserves, they are, ultimately, the real strengths of this important book.
