Rutherford, Madison, and Teaneck, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, and London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1982. 435 pp. In his 1976 book, Revolutionary Jews from Marx to Trotsky, the British historian Robert Wistrich discussed how ten famous socialist revolu- tionaries viewed their Jewish origins. In his new volume, Socialism and the Jews. The Dilemmas of Assimilation in Germany and Austria-Hungary, Wistrich goes far beyond an examination of "Jewish" socialists like Rosa Luxemburg or Eduard Bernstein to present a meticulous analysis of the ideologies and the policies of German and Austrian Social Democrats toward the Jews and the Jewish question in the decades before World War I. Wistrich focuses on socialist attitudes toward three issues: Jewish emancipation and assimilation, anti-Semitism, and the rise of Zionism and Jewish nationalism. In each of these areas he wisely places socialist argu- ments within the context of German and Austrian politics. Thus, he does not treat the reader merely to an exercise in socialist dialectical theorizing, but rather to an understanding of how the socialists realized their ideology in the very real world of politics. In so doing he comes to grips with the significant differences between German and Austrian political realities in</page><page sequence="2">260 BOOK REVIEWS the nineteenth century. Despite socialism's enormous commitment to ideology, and Wistrich's own interest in the ideas of Karl Marx, Karl Kautsky, Otto Bauer, and others, one is struck by the crucial impact of the political environment on that ideology. German and Austrian Social Democrats shared certain assumptions about the Jews. They supported Jewish emancipation and advocated the total assimilation of the Jews into European society. Indeed, Marxists argued that the Jews only existed as a group because of their economic func- tion in precapitalist society. With the spread and development of capitalism, the basis for Jewish group distinctiveness would disappear and the Jews would cease to exist. Jewish workers should join their class brethren to overthrow the capitalist order and create a classless society without Jews or other ethnic groups. At the end of the nineteenth century this socialist doctrine of assimilation faced the twin challenges posed by political anti- Semitism on the one hand and the rise of Zionism on the other. The political environment of Germany and Austria conditioned, Wistrich argues, the response of German and Austrian socialists to these movements. Both socialist parties shared a common ideological position on anti- Semitism. German and Austrian spokesmen argued that anti-Semitism represented the reaction of backward-looking classes, especially the lower middle class, to the rise of capitalism. These petty bourgeois merely blamed Jewish capitalists, rather than all capitalists, for their plight. Socialists expected these classes to decline into the proletariat and then participate in the revolution against the bourgeois order. In the 1890s some socialists felt that by attacking capitalist and liberal society, anti-Semitism, the "Social- ism of Fools," might actually help prepare the way for the victory of the revolution itself. Despite the fact that they held the same ideological position, the German and Austrian Social Democratic parties adopted different strategies for dealing with anti-Semitism. The German party took a much firmer line against the anti-Semites than did the Austrian party, and in the 1880s the SPD vigorously condemned Stoecker's Berlin movement. Wistrich argues that it did so not because of sympathy for the Jews, but for political reasons. German socialists perceived that the traditional power structure used the anti-Semitic movement as a tool against socialism. Moreover, during the period of official antisocialist pressure, the SPD could not, in good cons- cience, countenance attacks on other groups. Finally, the German socialists recognized that anti-Semitism would only divert workers from their true class interests. Although the German socialists adopted a somewhat more</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 261 equivocal position in the 1890s, they nonetheless resisted anti-Semitism and immunized German workers against it. Austrian Social Democrats, on the other hand, always advocated a considerably more equivocal position on anti-Semitism than did the German party. Although the Austrian Social Democratic Party attacked the anti-Semitic Christian Social Party, it assumed a so-called neutral position on anti-Semitism and, in Wistrich's words, was "prepared to acquiesce in the temporary triumph of the 'Socialism of Fools'-even if the Jews were to be the first victims of the detour" (p. 248). The Austrian Socialist Party, often with Jewish spokesman in the lead, frequently justified anti-Semitism as a backlash against Jewish economic and political influence and claimed that the violence of the anti-Semitic parties was trivial. More importantly, the SPO itself indulged in vulgar anti-Semitic rhetoric. After the victory of the Christian Social Party in 1897, the socialists attacked it for not fulfilling its anti-Semitic promises and for its reliance on Jewish banks. Austrian socialists, Wistrich insists, indulged in anti-Semitic rhetoric more than their German colleagues because of the greater strength of anti- Semitic politics in Austria than in Germany. Austrian socialists had to work hard so as not to appear as a Judenschutztruppe, the defenders of the Jews. The large number of Jews in the ranks of the SPO, moreover, added to the party's desire to disassociate from the Jews themselves. Wistrich even suspects that Austrian socialists exceeded the requirements of the political environment and shared the anti-Semitic convictions of many Austrians. Wistrich also uses the differences in the Austrian and German political scenes to explain the divergent positions of German and Austrian socialists on Zionism and diaspora Jewish nationalism. Both parties sought total Jewish assimilation and viewed Zionism as a regressive, bourgeois pheno- menon. But the German socialists, who did not have to contend with a popular Jewish nationalist movement at home, could simply discount the movement as marginal and not concern themselves with it. Austrian social- ists, on the other hand, faced vigorous Jewish nationalism, especially in Galicia, and thus opposed it more categorically. Even though the SPO theoretically accepted the legitimacy of nationalism after 1899, it refused to accord the same national minority rights to the Jews that it was willing to grant to the Poles, Czechs, and other Austrian nationalities. Wistrich explains the inconsistency of Austrian Marxists like Karl Renner and Otto Bauer in terms of the political conditions in Galicia. The essentially German-oriented Social Democratic Party of Austria had to placate the Polish Social Democratic Party in Galicia, which vehemently opposed</page><page sequence="4">262 BOOK REVIEWS granting national minority status to the Jews. Although Wistrich does not blame anti-Semitism per se for SPO opposition to Jewish nationalism, anti- Semitism probably could provide a key to understanding this opposition. In his excellent discussion of Otto Bauer, for example, Wistrich implies that Bauer excluded the Jews from his scheme for a nationally-federated Austria and argued that the Jews were a historyless people doomed to disappear because, as a Jew himself, Bauer sought escape from his origins and total assimilation through socialism. Here Wistrich wisely avoids the simplistic term "self-hatred" which dotted his earlier work. Nevertheless, one does get the feeling that socialists of Jewish origin in Austria led the battle against the Jews and Jewish nationalism because of the extremely high levels of anti- Semitism in Austrian politics. To conclude, Wistrich has written a well-researched, thoughtful, inter- esting, and important book which mixes theory and politics with great skill. The reader is struck throughout by the author's disappointment that the socialists failed to uphold a consistent moral position and bowed to political exigencies. The book, however, does suffer from a few flaws. Occasionally Wistrich is much less clear than he might be. Moreover, he neglects all areas of Austria-Hungary outside of Vienna and Galicia. While his focus on SPO leadership might warrant that exclusion, he should have admitted that his interest lay with the party and its main bailiwick, Vienna. Finally, the sub- title of the book is somewhat misleading, since it implies a concern with Jews as socialists and the impact of socialism on the Jews in Germany and Austria. Instead, Wistrich presents only an analysis of important socialists (many of whom were Jewish) and their views on the Jewish question. These criticisms aside, Wistrich's book is important and deserves careful scholarly attention. Marsha L. Rozenblit University of Maryland College Park, Md.</page></plain_text>
