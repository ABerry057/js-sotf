<plain_text><page sequence="1">N. A. von Uchelen. Chagigah.: The Linguistic Encoding of Halakhah. Publi- cations of the Juda Palache Institute 10. Amsterdam: Juda Palache Institute, 1994. ix, 107 pp. This is a book for linguistic specialists in general, and especially for those who specialize in Mishnaic Hebrew. For generalists it offers insight on the juristic encoding of language. For experts on Mishnaic Hebrew, it is, to date, the most detailed and careful examination of the legal statements encoding the so-called oral law in its written instantiation of the early third century. N. A. von Uchelen runs us through a series of grammatical aspects of the text's main clauses and subclauses. He analyzes such issues as mood, function, syntax, semantics, assertions, opinions, and more. The author steadily guides the reader from formalistic aspects of grammar through to pragmatic, functional, and intercolnective communicative aspects of grammar. He concludes with some sociolinguistic and sociohistorical observations. It is at the latter level that the work also serves as a contribution to Jewish studies in general. Upon careful demonstration of the argumentative nature of Mishnah, it becomes more than evident that the transference of the notion of apodictic law from biblical law to mishnaic halakhah is inappropriate and a misnomer. Though not stated by von Uchelen, biblical law is constantly framed in a theological inclusio which serves as the source of its authority. Hence the law itself may be stated in a declarative authoritative structure as its mythos (Avot 1:1), but there is no constant reminder of such. It comes, then, as no surprise that von Uchelen demonstrates this in the microscopic details of the text's grammar as argumentational, not apodictic. This is a severe blow to David Halivni's thesis, as put forth in his Midrash, Mishnah and Gemarah (see von Uchelen, pp. 3 and 58-59, n. 11). It also interfaces with the work of several other scholars, including Jacob Neusner and David M. Goodblatt. The work is well bound in soft covers, pleasantly laid out, and provided with bibliography and indices. Unfortunately, it does not provide readers</page><page sequence="2">122 BOOK REVIEWS with the complete mishnaic text of Hagigah for easy reference. In addition, since it is based exclusively on the printed editions, it becomes inaccurate when textual variants affect the grammatical features of the text's sentence structure as analyzed. For example, on pp. 48-49, the "simple dispute pattern" is considered to be "joined adversatively" by means of a waw. As this reviewer demonstrated in his dissertation on Mishnah Sukkah (1979), but as could be surmised already from J. N. Epstein's Mavo' le-Nusah ha-Mishnah (Jerusalem, 1964), this construction is a feature of the printed editions, and the better manuscripts do not bring the dispute form with waw construction linkage. Happily, the overall program does not fall on text criticism, though the project is thereby put at risk. Given the fact that facsimile editions of MSS Kaufman, Parma, etc., are readily available, in fact, it may not be too late to produce an insert of the mishnaic text to accompany this otherwise careful study.
