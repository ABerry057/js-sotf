Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2004. xv, 205 pp. A growing literature on the emergence of a Hebrew national culture in the Jewish Yishuv of Palestine has opened up new understandings of the construc- tion of Jewish nationhood in the modem world and its place in the broader context of modem nationalism. Yaacov Shavit and Shoshana Sitton conceive their study of the Yishuv's festive culture primarily as a contribution to this literature, in which they point to two principal lacunae. First, they argue that much of the scholarship to date has overlooked or oversimplified what were in fact "complex links between the ceremonial tradition and the [new national] festivals" (xii). Indeed, the revolutionary self-image that was central to so much of Zionist thought has often excessively colored the historiographical picture, and scholars have at times too hastily accepted the notion that Zionist culture in Palestine was an unambiguously radical new departure, fundamentally at variance with traditional Jewish ways of life. In fact, revolutionary though it was, Zionist culture in Palestine grew out of an often intense (if ambivalent) dia- logue with the Jewish past. Not infrequently, it is the very attempts by (some) Zionist cultural activists to shake free of that tradition's impact that most clearly reveal its lingering shadow. 208</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Although this paradoxical foundation of Zionist cultural work may itself have lain just below the surface of its protagonists' consciousness much of the time, they were, by contrast, often acutely aware that what they were engaged in was an attempt to create a new nation-at times, as it seemed to them, virtually ex nihilo. This deliberateness in the creation of the practices and rituals that composed what the authors describe as an "official popular culture" (125) has also, they write, received scant attention. Consequently, their own study seeks to highlight "the significant role of the stagers" and the staging process. Although it is not clear that this self-conscious dimension of Zionist cultural efforts has in fact gone quite as unnoticed as Shavit and Sitton suppose, their book's impetus does suggest the potential for an important commentary on the ways in which culture has been conceptualized in studies of the Yishuv to date. The examination of "culture" in many of these studies-as is often true in studies of national cultures generally-seldom goes beyond an analysis of dis- course. Broader conceptualizations of culture, in which multiple discourses are intertwined with the full spectrum of human activity-festive, political, economic, and much more-are often neglected, as is the reality of the human agents whose lives manifest these concrete activities. All told, then, these are compelling motivations indeed for a study of the Yishuv's festive lore as a pivotal component of the construction of a national public space and new forms of national sacrality. The book's potential is marred, however, by problematic historical presuppositions and an insufficiently nuanced analysis of cultural manifestations and the actors who produced them. One of its important premises-that the Yishuv's culture was produced in a society "with a common ideological and cultural base" (16)-disregards the cultural fissures and ideological divisions that riddled the Yishuv and the many subcultures that existed in it side by side, often in uneasy coexistence. This presupposition colors the book's examination of specific cultural undertakings in the Yishuv. In their inquiry into the production of kibbutz festivals, for example, the authors take note of the fact that "in nearly every kibbutz there were disagreements" (114). There is little exploration, however, of the substance of these disagreements or their importance for competing visions of the national culture and its festive lore. The same pattern characterizes the book's discussion of celebrations in Palestine's cities. Concerns among some groups that Tel Aviv's popular Purim carnival has become the site of"ostantatiousness [and] unnecessary extravagance" or by others that such street revelry is an imitation of "ancient pagan ways... steeped in drunkenness and abject debauchery" (102) might offer an intriguing window into competing visions of Jewish nationhood and the national culture. They are mentioned, however, almost parenthetically, and merely as indicators of the difficulties faced by the event's apparently monolithic group of "stagers." The book pays considerable attention to the efforts of the Jewish National Fund's Teachers' Committee in establishing new rituals in the Yishuv's schools, yet the authors conclude that, in at least one important case, a competing approach prevailed (82). There is no analysis of what led to the dominance of one vision over another, and the opposing position-which, by the book's own account, 209</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews actually prevailed-is neither explored nor explained. Consequently, there is little compelling support, in the end, for the claim that the Teachers' Committee "played a major role in creating [...] popular culture and national feasts" and that it "suc- ceeded in making holidays a major item on the agenda" (83). Ultimately, although the book seeks to examine the creation of ceremonies as part of the "process that determined [the] identity" of the Yishuv's Hebrew culture (125), explication of historical processes is left largely unspoken. Reflecting on the upheavals of Jewish life during his generation, Nahum Benari, a central figure in the creation of the kibbutz festivals, wrote in 1967 that the "profound imprint" of these changes must be given expression in the nation's public ceremonies and commemorations (113). Shavit and Sitton's book does point to some important new directions in the study of the national culture that was created in Palestine, both in response to these upheavals and as a catalyst for revolutionary change in Jewish life-even if their own steps along this path remain somewhat halting. What the book does make clear is that there is yet a great deal of light to be shed on the creation of national rituals and celebra- tions in the Yishuv and on their place in the fundamental restructuring of Jewish culture that was undertaken by Zionism in Palestine.
