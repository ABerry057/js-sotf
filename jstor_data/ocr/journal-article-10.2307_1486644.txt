<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naomi W. Cohen. Jews in Christian America: The Pursuit of Religious Equality. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. viii, 300 pp. On June 25, 1962, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a short, nonsectarian, voluntary prayer written by the New York State Board of Regents for use in the public schools. In Engel v. Vitale, the Court, by a vote of six to one, held that the prayer violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. As Associate Justice Hugo Black wrote, "it is no part of the business of the government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people." In the superbly well-documented account of the case that she provides in Jews in Christian, America, Naomi Cohen points out that Jewish organizations, which had been combating religion in the classroom, "could not have asked for more ... Engel was an unqualified vindication" (p. 171). Equally significant, the decision indicated that the Court was certain to strike down devotional reading of the Bible in the public schools, as indeed it did a year later. Yet Professor Cohen's careful analysis also reveals a "rampant divisive- ness" within the Jewish community. Afraid of being branded atheistic or of fomenting antisemitism, many Jews had not wished to challenge the Regents' prayer in court. Even Leo Pfeffer, an ardent separationist and chief architect of the American Jewish Congress's legal strategy to combat religion in the schools, thought the prayer was "as nonsectarian as a prayer can be" and feared that a test case was bound to fail (p. 168). The Court's ruling sparked a bitter debate within the Jewish community between separationists, who applauded the result, and accommodationists, who deplored it. The latter group included an Orthodox rabbi who thought a nondenominational prayer would stimulate religious awareness, a Conservative rabbi who railed against the "non-existent wall of separation of church and state "(p. 182), and a Reform rabbi who declared that Jewish organizations must not "demand in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 291 the name of Judaism that every Jew must rejoice when a non-offensive prayer is eliminated from the schools" (p. 183). The reaction to the Engel decision perfectly illustrates Cohen's four major themes in this superb account of Jews and religious equality from colonial times to the present. First, "never did the Jewish community behave as a monolith on church-state issues" (p. 9). Differences always existed between rabbis and laymen, between Orthodox and non-Orthodox, and between the assertive American Jewish Congress and the more cautious American Jewish Committee and Anti-Defamation League. Second, "Jews of all stripes-immigrant or acculturated, Reform or Orthodox, aggressive or timid-weighed their activities against existing or anticipated popular opin- ion" (p. 8) and always considered whether a particular stand on separation would promote "an adverse reaction toward Jewish security or comfort" (ibid.). Third, the Jewish position on church-state issues depended on other communal priorities, such as "a desire to foster interreligious understanding in the post-World War II era," or, later on, a desire to maintain public support for aid to Israel. Finally, Cohen asserts, Jews have always exhibited a serious concern "lest strict separationism adversely affect religion in general and Judaism in particular" (p. 9). These themes are developed differently in the two parts of the book. The first part traces about three hundred years of the Jewish experience in America, from the seventeenth century to 1945. Here, Cohen paints in broad strokes, necessarily omitting much but treating selected incidents in a thoughtful and persuasive way. With respect to the idea of religious equality, she maintains, "the Jews built on an American principle but ventured to shape that principle to suit their own needs" (p. 10), and in so doing, they were "actively redefining the rules of the American game" (ibid.). Among the topics Cohen discusses in these chapters are the disabilities suffered by colonial Jews, the origins of separationism early in the nineteenth century in opposition to "a rising clamor for a Christian state," the debate in 1826 over Maryland's "Jew Bill" which eliminated the Christian oath that barred Jews from holding office, the role of Jewish immigrants from Germany, who "proved from the outset the more fervent and doctrinaire exponents of religious liberty and a religiously neutral state" (p. 43), the debate in the post-Civil War years over adopting a so-called Christian Amendment to the Constitution, the controversy sparked by Supreme Court Justice David Brewer's 1892 decision in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, which</page><page sequence="3">292 BOOK REVIEWS stated that "this is a Christian nation," and by his 1905 lectures, The United States a Christian Nation, and Jewish opposition to Sunday laws and public school released-time programs. The second part of the book focuses on the years from 1945 to 1965. Relying heavily on the files of the American Jewish Congress, the Anti- Defamation League, and the American Jewish Committee, Cohen offers a revealing account of the Jewish strategy in-and response to-the legal battles over released time, prayer in the public schools, the rights of Sabbath observers, and religious displays on public property. She discusses not only landmark federal decisions, but also crucial cases at the state level. An afterword deals with Lynch v. Donnelly, the 1984 Supreme Court ruling which upheld the erection of a creche with public funds. Jews in Christian America explains the process by which Jews moved from an older view which held that government should be neutral toward all religions to a modem emphasis on "the concept of a secular government." With respect to the First Amendment's establishment clause, Jews called for "the elimination of government-supported practices that in any way operated to make the Jew an outsider, or somehow less than equal, in American society" (p. 129). Yet Cohen notes, too, that in recent years Jews have begun to pay more attention to the free exercise clause, and have therefore defended policies that accommodate the interests of observant Jews. Such policies-for example, permitting an Orthodox Jew in the military to wear a yarmulke even if this violates the dress code-may contradict "the strict interpretation of establishment," but "better suit the reality of a pluralist setting" (p. 245). The story of how the Jewish community in the last twenty-five years has dealt with the conflicting claims of the establishment and free exercise clauses will require a book in itself. In the meantime, Cohen has put all scholars in her debt with this important and informative work. Richard Polenberg Cornell University Ithaca, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
