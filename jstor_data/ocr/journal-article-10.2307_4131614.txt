Stan- ford: Stanford University Press. ix, 326 pp. This book is presented as "first a study of the classic rabbinic discourse on menstruation and of the range of meanings that talmudic literature accords to 322</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews women's bodies in its discourse on Niddah" (p. 1). As the presence of the word "Christian" in the subtitle would suggest, however, the actual contents of the book are somewhat broader. The range of materials covered are all worthy of scholarly examination and analysis, which Fonrobert ably and engagingly provides. Yet, the wide reach of this book contributes to both its strengths and its weaknesses. In Chapters 1-4, Fonrobert reads texts from the tractate Niddah in the Mish- nah and the Babylonian Talmud (and to a lesser extent the Tosefta and the Pales- tinian Talmud). She seeks both to elucidate the "dominant discourse" in these texts as they construct women and women's bodies, and also to locate the "moment[s] of disturbance in the dominant discourse" (p. 104). Broadly, Fonrobert's thesis is that rabbinic texts construct the female body, particularly sexual organs and the re- productive tract, through architectural metaphors, by which women and women's bodies may become the objects of androcentric discourse. A similar effect occurs in rabbinic discourse about the examination of blood stains; male rabbis are posi- tioned as authorities over female blood, which is further removed from the (bod- ies of) women who actually experience menstruation or other genital flows. But Fonrobert also cogently reads for the moments when this dominant discourse is un- dermined, when the texts themselves admit/confront "the conceptualization of the female body as a sentient being, as already 'inhabited' by the feeling subject" (p. 69), as, for example, in her analysis of a story in bNid 20b, in which Yalta en- gineers a rabbinic ruling about her blood sample that is to her liking. The latter two chapters move outward from either menstruation (Chapter 5) or rabbinic sources (Chapter 6). Chapter 5 is an attempt to "think more . .. about the possibility of women's space within the discursive universe of the rabbis, par- ticularly with reference to women's bodies," that is, to seek "cultural spaces in which women relate directly to women and can establish relationships that are not under the immediate control of male authority .. ." (p. 129). Tractate Niddah is a fruitful site for this work in that it "considers various other situations in which women's bodies are examined" (p. 130), including examinations performed by oth- er women. Similarly, Fonrobert's turn in these chapters to early Christian works- notably the Didascalia Apostolorum of the third century CE-and to Greco-Ro- man medical writing contextualizes rabbinic menstrual discourse in a way not of- ten seen in scholarship on the subject. On the other hand, these moves also become opportunities for digressions that make the book as a whole feel somewhat dis- jointed. Chapter 5 concludes by asking "whether it is possible to trace the exis- tence of women healers" (p. 151). This is a worthy question, but Fonrobert does not make clear its connection to her subjects of menstruation and the construction of the female body; indeed, she seeks an answer in an extended corpus, outside of tractate Niddah (bShab. 133b-134a), of medical information-attributed by the amora Abaye to his mother-particularly regarding the care of infants. The chap- ter on the Didascalia and other Christian sources includes a discussion of the uses of rabbinic menstrual laws in a particular kind of anti-Jewish feminist New Testa- ment scholarship; ten pages are then dedicated to analyzing a New Testament sto- ry and its relationship, or lack thereof, to rabbinic menstrual laws and discourse. This book engages several important and ongoing methodological debates in the field(s) of rabbinic and feminist studies, and evaluations of its effectiveness 323</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews may well be influenced by the reader's personal positioning regarding these ques- tions. First, Fonrobert does not discuss very much the extensive literature as to whether rabbinic midrash is best understood as a response to internal, hermeneu- tical considerations of the biblical text or external, sociocultural and historical is- sues (or some mix of the two). Yet, despite her historicizing moves in the latter chapters, Fonrobert's self-positioning on the hermeneutical side of the debate in this instance is evident. A major premise of her analysis of the rabbinic discourse on women's bodies begins with a pair of verses, Leviticus 15:2 and 19, in which a man's genital discharge is described as being "mibisaro," "from his flesh," where- as a woman's is "bivsara," "in her flesh." Fonrobert suggests that the rabbis' hermeneutical attention to this difference in prepositions led them to "construct the interior of the woman's body, while not admitting the possibility of thinking the interior of the male body" (p. 49), resulting in the architectural metaphors al- ready discussed. She writes, "The rabbinic understanding of corporeal practices and the body's role in the constitution of the Jewish community are products of the rabbis' biblical hermeneutics as much as the other way around" (p. 40). I find the rabbinic attention to the biblical prepositions intriguing, but insufficiently ex- planatory of the turn to architectural metaphors in particular. Fonrobert seems to share a common desire of feminist scholars to recover women's lost or marginalized voices. She demonstrates quite well the various ways, rhetorical and otherwise, that statements attributed to women in rabbinic and early Christian literature are indeed marginalized both by the texts she examines and in later exegetical traditions (including modern scholarship). Thus, for exam- ple, in her analysis ofAbaye's mother's medical advice, Fonrobert suggests that the distinctive form of citation used for these statements can be read as reducing the authoritative weight of the female voice; she further demonstrates how later schol- ars often disregarded these materials or further diminished their significance. Her work becomes more problematic, though, when she takes up the question of whether it is indeed possible to retrieve a "uniquely authoritative woman's voice" even if one is able "to reverse the continuous process of. . . marginalization" (p. 153). Fonrobert is aware of the likelihood that in other ancient works feminine figures (for example, Diotima in Plato's Symposium) exist as "literary construc- tion[s]" and creations of a male author, rather than as "representation" (p.158). However, she argues against reading the sayings of Abaye's mother in this way, based on the nature of the Talmud as "collective" and "citational literature"; "Even though the overwhelming majority of speaking participants are men, we should not single out the one woman's voice as the only one not 'quoted' but the mere prod- uct of male speech" (p. 159). The obvious difficulty here is that the current trend in rabbinic scholarship has been against naively assuming that materials (quotes or biographical stories) attributed to male figures in rabbinic literature may be read as unproblematically representational, rather than as constructions developed in the process of textual transmission and redaction. Moreover, this recourse to the supposedly distinctive nature of rabbinic liter- ature would seem not to be available when Fonrobert turns to the Didascalia. She does begin by recognizing that "we do not have the voices of the women themselves in the form of independent texts," yet here too the desire to assert the presence of 324</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews women's voices creeps back in over the course of the chapter. The Didascalia text is structured as direct discourse to women in the author's community who are prac- ticing some form of menstrual separation, and presents several rationales that the women might give for their actions (each followed by a rebuttal). Fonrobert sug- gests that "It seems likely that this reasoning is not merely thought up by the author, but is indeed one that the women put forward" (p. 175). This conjecture becomes, rhetorically, all the more certain as the chapter progresses, so that as Fonrobert moves through the Didascalia, she can write, "Now the author... turns to the oth- er argument that the women advance" (p. 179) and "The third and final argument ... is not a response to a specific claim made by the women themselves" (p. 186). Fonrobert advises her fellow scholars that "It is our task as readers of tal- mudic literature not to succumb to constructing uniformity where there is doubt, contradiction, ambiguity, and difference" (p. 67). Despite the concerns I have ex- pressed above, I believe Fonrobert has provided a worthy model of how to achieve the goal she advocates. Her work is nuanced, erudite, and never simplistic. Her readers, whether in rabbinics, gender studies, or both, would do well to follow her example. Gail Labovitz Jewish Theological Seminary New York, New York</page></plain_text>
