For it is written: 'And there was no water for the congregation ['eda] since it was for her merit that the well traveled [with the Israelites] and we allude to it that he [the deceased] is a great man and he is worthy that water would cease on his behalf.2 R. Shimshon associated the custom of spilling the water in proximity to the deceased with the passing of the biblical prophetess Miriam. In the short quote above, he referred to well-known Jewish homiletic traditions that link the miracu lous well that accompanied the Israelites during their travels in the wilderness to the prophetess Miriam (sister of Moses and Aaron), and its eventual disappearance with her demise. 1. 1.

For early scholarly discussions of this custom see: A. R Bender, "Beliefs, Rites and Customs of the Jews connected with Death Burial and Mourning," JQR 6-7 (1894-1895), especially Jewish Quarterly Review 7, 101-118. 75</page><page sequence="2">EphraimEphraim Shoham-Steiner Jewish homilists noticed that the verse, "The community was without water" (Numbers 20:2) directly followed the biblical account of the prophetess' death—"and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there" (Numbers 20:1)—and thus linked the two issues together. Despite referring to an existing tradition, R. Shimshon suggested a novel, unprecedented parallel. According to some midrashic works a connection exists between Miriam's presence and water, and between her absence and thirst.3 R. Shimshon, however, went one step further and suggested that water be spilled symbolically upon a person's death, indicating that the deceased was as worthy and as great as as Miriam. The custom of spilling water in the immediate vicinity of the dead, men tioned by R. Shimshon, was a well-known custom in Franco-German Jewish circles in the Middle Ages. Although it had been mentioned in several sources prior to R. Shimshon's Tashbez, and may even predate the medieval period,4 the more common explanation for this custom in the medieval Franco-German realm was of a medico-magical nature, having more to do with dangers to the living than with honoring of the dead. A short exemplum found in the thirteenth century "Ethical Will of Rabbi Judah the Pious" (Zava 'at Rabbi Yehudah ha-Hasid)5ha-Hasid)5 describes this rather clearly: A man once drank the water in a neighboring house where someone had just died. A sage reprimanded him. Shortly thereafter, the man who drank the water also died. The sage was asked regarding this matter. He answered, "I saw the Angel of Death cleansing his knife in the water after the first man's death."6 3. Yalkut Shimoni, Hukat par. 76. The compiler of the YS drew on מדרש פטירת אהרון the midrash "The passing of Aaron''; see Adolph Jellinek, Bet ha-midrash Erster Theil, (Jerusalem: Wahrman Books 1967), 91-95. 4. The belief in a connection between a dead person's thirst and the lack of water in the under world can be traced back to ancient Greece, where liquid libations for the dead were sometimes viewed as their food or drink. Some Jewish traditions dating from late antiquity allude to this notion and relate to the sufferings of the wicked in the underworld to the lack of the liquid of life, colored by the terrible heat and thirst in Gehena. See Saul Lieberman, "A1 hataim ve-'onsham," in Shaul Lieberman: meh karimkarim be-torat erez-yisrael, ed. David Rosenthal (Jerusalem: Magnes 1991), 70-89. On the ancient Greek ritual of making liquid libations for the dead see Walter Burkert, Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical,Classical, trans. John Raffan (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985), 70-73. 5. The ethical will attributed to Rabbi Judah b. Shmuel ("the Pious") of Regensburg (d. 1217) is a thirteenth-century tractate that was eventually paired up with Judah's more commonly known ethical work "The Book of the Pious" (Sefer Hasidim). On R. Judah's ethical will see A. I. Shvat, "Zava'at Rabbi Yehudah ha-hasid: hem nikhtav 'avur ha-zibur ha-rahav oh le-zar'oh," Sinai 133 (2004): 199-227. And more recently, Maoz Kahana, "Mekorot ha-ei'edah u-temurot ha-zeman: zava'at R. Yehudah ha-Hasid ba-'et ha-hadashah" in Semikhut ruhanit: ma'avkim 'al koah tarbuti be-hagot ha-yehudit,ha-yehudit,ha-yehudit, eds. Haim Rreisel et al., (Beersheba: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev &amp; Mosad Bialik Press, 2010), 233-262. 6. As stated above the exemplum appears in the addenda to the "The Ethical Will of R. Judah the Pious") printed in R. Margaliyot, Sefer Hasidim (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1957) 32, § 4 (Hebrew). 76</page><page sequence="3">The Virgin Mary, Miriam, and Jewish Reactions Not surprisingly, R. Shimshon was well aware of the tradition voiced in this exem plum and the explanation it offers, as he had included it in his collection only a few paragraphs prior to his discussion of the connection between spilling the water and Miriam's well.7 Indeed, the above-mentioned rationalization for the custom of spilling the water and its association with the dangers related to death, dying, and the Angel of Death in particular, can be found in various other Ashkenazi sources as well.8 Why, then, would R. Shimshon attempt to offer an alternative explanation for this practice when a perfectly acceptable one already existed? What need did this fulfill? A close reading of the sources shows a rise in the number of refer ences to Miriam in medieval Ashkenaz (especially from the late twelfth century) and their gradual fading and near disappearance by the fourteenth century. I suggest that this rise is linked to the rise in prominence of the figure of the Virgin Mary as well as with the interface between her cult and the Jews. Yet, apart from the direct outright polemics against the cult of the Virgin Mary already discussed in the scholarship, it seems Jews employed other and more subtle ways to contend with the formidable Marian challenge. Acknowledging the appealing and persuasive aspects of the cult of the virgin, the motherly love and the role of charity and compassion it advocated, Jews came up with a variety of tools in their attempt to deflect the power of the virgin and her cult. One such way was the internal empowerment of Jewish female figures, such as the prophetess Miriam and other Jewish female figures, whose empowerment appears to be a response to the rise of the Christian cult of Mary and its perceived threat to Jews. Miriam and the Marian Challenge The Virgin Mary and the biblical Miriam share more than their name. Chris tian theology often closely linked the two figures. "In many respects," writes Jar oslav Pelikan, "the most obvious prototype of Mary anywhere in the Old Testament had to be Miriam, sister of Moses and Aharon."9 But Miriam was more commonly associated in Christian writing with a different role. In the thirteenth-century genre of the Bible Moralisee there is an image of biblical 7. Tashbez para. 442. 8. A brief summary of these traditions can be found in the recently published Sefer ha-kushiyot, see Jacob Yisrael Stahl, ed., Sefer ha-kushiyot (Jerusalem: Stahl, 2007), 193-194, § 259. The rational ization for the custom discussed may be found in halakhic literature as well, as in Rabbi Isaac ben Moses of Vienna's thirteenth-century book Or Zaru'a; see: Yizhak b. Moshe of Vienna, Sefer Or-Zaru'a,Or-Zaru'a, 2 vols (Zhytomyr 1862), vol.1 Hilkhot Pesah § 240. See also, Eliyahu Dov Pines, Piskei RabenuRabenu Yeh'iel mi-Paris (Jerusalem: Machon Yerushalayim, 1973) 37 §67. There were of course other dangers associated with water, most importantly the Talmudic tradition that continued to prevail especially among woman regarding the dangers of the Tekufa.

The leprous Miriam, the older sister, needs her two younger righteous brothers Moses and Aaron and their redemptive prayers—who stand for the apostles Peter and Paul—to deliver her from the leprosy of sin and disbelief. In other scenes Jews were shown in need of the Virgin Mary's caritas so they may see the truth of Christianity. The idea that the Virgin Mary was indeed the possible bridge over the reli gious divide may be at the heart of the perceived threat Jews identified in the figure of the Virgin Mary. In the anti-Jewish polemics of the late eleventh-century English churchman Gilbert Crispin, described as based on an actual debate with a Jew that took place in London in 1092, the Virgin Mary and the issues of Imma culate Conception and Virgin Birth appear at the heart of the discussion. Anna Sapir-Abulafia has shown through the letters by Odo of Tournai, bishop of Cambrai (1050-1113) that the figure of the Virgin Mary was indeed often cited in anti-Jewish polemics in the twelfth century.10 There is also evidence that in the early twelfth-century tractates on the incar nation, the virgin birth and the special caritas of the Virgin Mary, whose circula tion was previously limited to monastic circles, were beginning to influence wider Christian circles. Some of this material was used to strengthen and reinforce Jewish converts that had still fostered deliberations regarding their new faith. In his early twelfth-century autobiography, Abbot Guibert of Nogent (c.1055 1124) mentioned that when he was a monk at the Abby of St. Germer at Fly he had given his Tractatus de incarnatione contra iudaeos to a fellow monk, a recently converted Jew, who had lapsed into doubt on religious matters. Guibert was convinced that meditating on the Virgin, as well as studying the above mentioned theological concepts in depth, were the right remedy for converts whose fidelity to their new faith seemed endangered.11 Israel Yuval pointed out the appearance of the Miracula Sanctae Virginis Mariae in northern France, including miracle tales about those who sing the Ave Maria in the Virgin's honor, as an important milestone in what would in a later period develop into a full-blown attack on Jews and Judaism.12 Indeed, in the Virgin Mary miracula col lections that circulated in Europe from the twelfth century, and even more so in writings of members of the Mendicant orders from the thirteenth century, the Virgin appears time and again helping Jews who had converted to Christianity, as well as other former "infidels."13 Even as late as the fourteenth century, Jews 10.

The best known example for this is probably Solomon ha-Levi of Burgos, the leading rabbi of the town, who chose the auspices of the Virgin Mary for his conversion when he was christened Pablo de Santa Maria.14 Jews were apparently not only aware of the rise of the Marian cult but felt specifically challenged by the message delivered through the stories linking the figure of the Virgin Mary and the Jews' conversion. Late twelfth- and thirteenth century Jewish sources reveal a high level of awareness to the presence of Mary as an important figure in Christianity, alongside Jesus. The twelfth-century Tosafist Rabbi Jacob ben Meir Tam (d. 1171), from the northern French town of Ramerupt, is reported to have inquired through magical means whether "Jesus and his mother Mary" (Yeshu ve-imo Miryam) are hinted to in the Bible. The answer, typical of Jewish anti-Christian polemics, suggested that they are, but in a pejorative manner. The sage to whom Rabbi Jacob had turned with his question, identified in the text as Ba 'al ha-halom (lit. "master of the dream"), refers to the esoteric numerical value of the Hebrew words "Elohei nekhar ha-arez" (lit: "the foreign idols of the land," referring to Deuteronomy 31:16), suggesting that these words share the same numeric value as the names Jesus and Mary when spelled in Hebrew (Yeshu u-Miryam)}5 The mid-thirteenth century Jewish mystic and self proclaimed messiah Abraham Abulafia made similar claims with reference to the same gematria.16 Scholars have noted the increasing presence of explicit or implicit references to Christian targets of worship. Israel Yuval noted that the changes and adaptations made to the Jewish prayer 'Alenu le-shabeah (a possible Jewish, Hebrew equival ent of the Christian, Latin Te Deum laudamus), involving harsh language against Jesus and Mary, were prompted by a Jewish response to the potential threat ident ified by Jews in the Marian cult.17 Arthur Green and Peter Schafer have shown the impact of the Marian cult on the minds and thought of medieval European Jews, 14. Judith Gale Kreiger, "Pablo de Santa Maria: His Epoch, Life and Hebrew and Spanish Lit erature Productions" (PhD diss., University of California, 1988). 1 15. The context of this verse, not explicit in the text, is telling. The full verse (Deut. 31:16) deals with one who goes astray and follows the foreign idols of the land instead of following the true God of the Hebrews. The word referring to "going astray" is vezanah, which may also mean: "was tempted in a sexually promiscuous fashion," using the same Hebrew root as that used for a whore (zonah). This is a covert way of making a very rude statement about both Jesus and Mary. 16.

Also those in circles of Zoharic literature acknowledged the importance of the Virgin Mary alongside Jesus, as Elliot R. Wolfson emphasized, through the use of the figures of Samael and Lilith that represented "the other god and the foreign kingship" who "stand respectively for Jesus and Mary," can be seen as "the masculine and feminine forces of impurity."18 A possible inward acculturation of the figure of the Virgin Mary nurturing the baby Jesus was also suggested by Ivan Marcus who linked it to the Ashkenazi rite of initiation that took place when children entered the realm of Torah study. And similar models of acculturation following the possible resonance to the cult of the Virgin Mary were noted by Elisheva Baumgarten in the realm of female customs and life-cycle ceremonies, with a special emphasis on rituals associated with birth and circumcision.19 In a different realm, art historians Katrin Kogman-Appel and Sara Offenberg recently discussed Jewish awareness to the most intricate details of Christian and Marian theology and an attempt to create Jewish imagery that averts it.20 It is, thus, not surprising that beginning in the late twelfth-century European Jews, and especially Jewish women, came up with a new role for the biblical Miriam, a role designed to coun terbalance the cult of the Virgin Mary. What medieval Jewish European culture, both scholarly as well as popular, found in the biblical Miriam (and possibly in other powerful female biblical her oines like Eve and the matriarchs—a matter in need of further investigation) was a traditional, towering Jewish female figure that predated the Virgin Mary, and did not fall short in personality, merit, and impact. Miriam, specifically, was also closely associated with guidance, guardian ship, and healing, and with redemption through water and water sources in particu lar. Miriam was a figure who could be readily linked with miracles for the faithful, 18.

The rise of the cult of the Virgin Mary is also reflected in the number of church dedications and rededications to her name in the late 12th and early 13th centuries; see also Richard Marks, Image and and Devotion in Late Medieval England (Phoenix Mill Gloucestershire: The History Press, 2004) 38 63. 19.

Israel Yuval suggests in a similar fashion that the use of the words: Moshav Yekaro (the seat of his homage) in the prayer Alenu le-shabeah should be read as a Jewish mirror image of the role of the Virgin Mary as 'sedes sapientae' (seat of wisdom) see Yuval, Two Nations, 200-201 and n.129; see also Elisheva Baumgarten, Mothers and Children: Jewish Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe (Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005), 113-116. 20.

A careful scrutiny of some medieval European Jewish sources reveals a subtle phenomenon—the gradual empowerment of the figure of the biblical Miriam. Earlier scholars dis cussed mutual influences between cultures living in close proximity. But recently, a more nuanced model better describing the process that took place at the cultural meeting point has emerged. This model is known as the model of acculturation. According to art historian Katrin Kogman-Appel, "A cultural need can emerge from tastes and fashions, but it can also be determined by the means a minority culture seeks self-definition. Self definition can lead to the adoption of a donor cul ture'sture's cultural elements to a degree that results in cultural symbiosis. It can however also be guided by the fear of assimilation, the fear of losing self defi nition. And the anxiety that the adoption of alien features may have a negative effect on ones own cultural repertoire."21 While Israel Yuval in his writings underscored the subtle as well as outright polemical model, Peter Schafer, Arthur Green, and especially Ivan Marcus adopted the acculturation model in the manner suggested above by Kogman Appel. But in meeting the external challenge poised by the Virgin Mary Jews also used what I suggest calling "inner self-empowerment." Drawing upon ideas and notions existing in their own internal sources, but realigning them and giving them a new meaning to meet a contemporary challenge, Jews employed a variety of tools to meet the Marian challenge. According to the suggested model, Miriam was chosen not only because of her biblical-midrashic image and because she was a woman, but also because she resembled the Christian locus of veneration, yet at the same time remained very "Jewish/' In this case Jews were not necessarily influenced or overwhelmed by the external, and had no need to reject it defiantly. They were also not appropriating a new model using a "cultural filter5' in an attempt to formulate it for their own use. Rather, they met what they had seen as an external challenge by slightly altering and mod ifying an existing trope drawn from the depths of their own cultural well, some times making subtle and nuanced changes to an existing tradition or figure, reinventing it, and reformulating it so that it was charged with a new, powerful meaning. This model also enabled Jews to feel shielded from external challenge. But the Jewish interpretative tradition of this period, and particularly Jewish Ashkenazi homiletics, aimed at wider audiences than the circle of Talmudic scho lars, engaged with the biblical and homiletic images of Miriam in order to supplant and respond simultaneously to the perceived power and allure of competing Chris tian traditions that surrounded them. Jewish authors who formulated their views on this apparent allure of competing Christian traditions within a traditional Jewish framework at the same time amplified and constructed new tropes in order to respond to and repel Christian traditions from without. These tropes were designed to deflect the threat of the powerful and suggestive religious tradition that were a formidable challenge for Jews. The image of Miriam arose as a subject because it 21. Katrin Kogman-Appel, "Jewish Art and Cultural Exchange: Theoretical Perspectives," Medieval Encounters 17 (2011): 1-26, esp. 20-21. 81</page><page sequence="8">EphraimEphraim Shoham-Steiner was common to both religious traditions, precisely because each of them was already invested in the theme, alluding to the same proof texts. However, by apply ing a different hermeneutical tool kit, the conclusions were different. Indeed, here one can identify the power of the Christian tradition as perceived by the Jews, as well as the close proximity and mutual awareness to the "other" and its suggestive powers.22 Jews recognized the Marian rites for what they were, as possessing the potential to lure Jews away from Judaism, and they reacted. Thus, when reading through medieval European Jewish rabbinic texts that mention Miriam, it is at times hard to discern which formulations are traditional and which ones innovative in a traditional guise, aimed at changing and slightly altering an existing homiletic tradition. From its emergence in the twelfth century until its eventual decline toward the fourteenth century, Jewish homilists and rabbinic writers were indeed attempting to revitalize Miriam's figure so that she could meet her match. Empowering Miriam in Medieval Ashkenaz Discussing the role of Miriam as leading the Israelite women in song follow ing the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 15) in his Sefer Gematriyot, the author Judah the Pious alluded to a well-known midrashic tradition that appears in Shemot Rabba (23:7): "Moses said: 'I shall sing to the Lord,' I and not an angel, and Miriam said: 'Let us sing to the Lord,' for she granted the angels the permission to sing along with her."23 At first sight these quotes appear rather inconspicuous, as they seem to invoke accepted Jewish homiletic traditions. However, a closer look reveals that this is a novel interpretation. According to Midrash Shemot Rabba, Moses and the 22.1 find the language and formulation employed by Elliot R. Wolfson in his previously men tione'd article to be suggestive: "the rejection of the 'other' does not mean the other has no impact over the formation of one's own sense of self; on the contrary, condemnation of the other bespeaks contiguity with the other, and this is so even when the other has preached intolerance or perpetrated violence in the sociopolitical arena" (Wolfson, Venturing Beyond, 2-5). 23.

On gematriva as hallmark of the medieval Askenazi pietistic inter pretative agenda see Daniel Abrams, "Introduction to the Book of Gematriyot," idem. Material originat ing from Sefer ha-gematriyot can be found in various other Ashkenazi works from the immediate Ashkenazi pietistic intellectual circle as well as from the broader Franco-German realm. Sara Offenberg has recently (2011) shown that many gimatriyot copied directly from the Sefer ha-gematriyot made their way into household cultural objects, such as the illuminated "London Miscellany" or Mikhlol London,London, See: Sara Offenberg, "Crossing Over from Earth to Heaven: The Image of the Ark and the MerkavahMerkavah in the North French Hebrew Miscellany" Kabbalah 26 (2012): 135-158, esp. 149. For the "London Miscellany" see Jeremy Schonfield, ed., The North French Hebrew Miscellany: British Library Library Add. MS II639 (London: Facsimile Editions, 2003). The quotes from the Sefer ha-gematriyot appear in fol. 615v-634v. 82</page><page sequence="9">The Virgin Mary, Miriam, and Jewish Reactions Israelite men were the first to praise the Lord following the parting of the Red Sea. The midrash explains that when the angels wished to sing the Lord's praise after having witnessed the miraculous deliverance, the parting of the sea and the Israe lites' safe crossing, God had silenced them, requesting they wait for the humans to conclude their canticle before erupting in celestial angelic singing. But in the Sefer Gematriyot,Gematriyot, Miriam's role in this scene slightly diverges from the traditional homi letic trope. In this thirteenth-century tractate it is Miriam who grants the angels permission to sing along with her and the other women, an act empowering Miriam beyond the mere supporting role attributed to her in both scripture and the standard homiletic tradition. However slight his change may seem, it is trans formative regarding the role of Miriam. A similar representation of Miriam's role that slightly deviates from the mid rashic tradition can also be found in another medieval German Jewish source, a commentary on the Pentateuch mistakenly attributed to Rabbi Elazar of Worms, the famous disciple of Rabbi Judah the Pious, but still stylistically within the circles of medieval German Jewish Pietists. Here Miriam's empowered figure commands the angels: And when the Israelites concluded their canticle the angels wished to sing and praise the Lord as well.. .the verse says 'and Miriam took'—she took the song from the angels using her prophetic powers and started singing. The angels said: "isn't it enough that the humans have preceded us in singing the Lord's praise, now the women will do so too?" She heard this claim through her prophecy and granted them permission to sing with her. That is why the verse reads: "Sing unto the Lord!" [in Hebrew shiru is a plural form in the imperative mood].24 It seems that either both medieval commentators shared a common homiletic source that discussed the authoritative role of Miriam in organizing the song after the parting of the sea, or that thirteenth-century commentators felt a pressing need to empower Miriam and to attribute to her the power to govern the angels in this situation. Either way, it is clear that some medieval European Jews wished to depict the prophetess Miriam in an empowered fashion. The role of the "conductor" of the heavenly choir was also assigned to the Virgin Mary. This attribution comes from an interpretative tradition that links Mary with the biblical Miriam, possibly drawing on early midrashic traditions. Jar oslav Pelican notes this identification of Mary, mother of Jesus, with Miriam, sister of Moses, as a constant theme of Christian typology.25 When commenting on the 24. See Rabbi Elazar of Worms, Perush Rokeah 'al ha-torah, 3 vols., ed. S. Kanevski (Bnei Brak: Y. Klugman, 1986), 1:83. Joseph Dan and Daniel Abrams have questioned the attribution of this commentary to Rabbi Elazar of Worms. See Joseph Dan, "Perush ha-torah le-Rabbi Elazar mi-garmeiza mahadurat Kaniyevsky," Kiryat Sefer 59 (1983): 644; Daniel Abrams, "Introduction to SeferSefer Gematriyot," in Judah ben Shmuel ha-hasid, Sefer ha-gematriyot, eds.

Another example of the empowerment of the figure of Miriam, found in the thirteenth-century Sefer Gematriyot is that representing Miriam's death as parallel to the death of the righteous great men, considered to have sin-cleansing attributes: "And Miriam died there" [sham, Numbers 20:1], It is from this that we learn that the death of the righteous has expiatory qualities. We conclude this from the presence of the word sham [=there] both in the death of Miriam [Numbers 20:1] and in the issue of the 'eglah 'arufah (Deuteronomy 21:1-10). Thus, just as the 'eglah 'arufah has expiatory qualities so does the death of a right eous person. Besides, the word sham in itself has the same numerical value as the word mekhaper [=lit. expiatory—the value of both is 340].27 Here too is an innovative interpretation masquerading as a traditional one, with very subtle variation from the traditional exegetical pattern that can almost pass undetected. In most homiletics on this matter (the parallel between the expiatory powers of the death of a righteous and the expiatory powers of the ritual of the red heifer) the proximity between the two texts is invoked. Miriam's death in Numbers 20 and the rituals of the red heifer are in close textual proximity (semikhut) and thus one may draw parallels from one to another. The death of a righteous person (Miriam) has expiatory powers in a similar fashion to the ashes of the red heifer (parah aduma). Sefer Gematriyot, however, makes a subtle change. He draws a parallel between a different she calf and the death of a righteous person (Miriam) and uses a different analogy technique, not the semikhut but the gezerah shava and it is not the ashes of the burnt red heifer that are at the focus but another she calf the 'egla 'arufah. A close analysis of the homiletic dis cussion's formulation reveals several structural, as well as thematic, changes. The textual proximity (semikhut) between the report on Miriam's death and the biblical discussion of the red heifer called for homiletic attention and led to emphasizing similarities between the two, such as the redemptory qualities of both. The she-calves mentioned (parah adumah and 'eglah 'arufah) not only have expiatory powers, especially with reference to death and dying, but they 26.26. Peter Schaff, ed., Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, vol. 8 (Buffalo, NY: Chris tian Literature Publishing, 1888). 27. Stahl, Sefer ha-gematriyot, 600 § 2. 'eglah 'arufah literary means "decapitated she calf." The reference is to the ruling in Deut. 21:1-10 This rite is considered expiatory and is aimed to ritually cleanse the inhabitants of the city nearest to the deceased from being accused of accessory and or responsibility for the murder that had been committed. 84</page><page sequence="11">The Virgin Mary, Miriam, and Jewish Reactions also have very much in common in their special ritual requirements. The red heifer was intended to ritually purify those defiled by impurity of the dead; the removal of the impurity is of a cultic nature, whereby those who attended the dead are restored to a state of ritual purity. This process resonates with the biography of Miriam. The 'eglah 'arufah, on the other hand, is understood to restore the moral equilibrium disturbed by the unaccounted-for death and innocent blood that was shed. The author of Sefer Gematriyot deviated from the traditional exeg esis and paralleled the death of Miriam to 'egla 'arufah using a different analogy technic based on the appearance of the word sham (there) in both the text about 'egla'egla 'arufah as well as the text about the death of Miriam. When one takes a closer look at the novel idea expressed in Sefer Gematriyot one cannot escape the associations that both rituals bring to mind. Miriam's death, then, too, came to be seen as not only as expiatory but also as redemptive. Apart from preferring a she-calf ritual that involves pouring water rather than burning, the most compelling part of all is the 'egla 'arufa scene graphically described in Deuteronomy 21. In this biblical practice the town elders are required to cleanse their hands with fresh water over the freshly decapitated she-calf, sym bolizing their expiation and ritually proclaiming their innocence and unaccount ability for the loss of life in their jurisdiction, "on their watch.יי Within the Judeo-Christian homiletic context this emotionally-charged scene was evoked in the Gospel of Matthew's depiction of Pilate washing his hands after condemning Jesus to the cross, washing away his blame for the crucifixion and placing it on the Jews (Matthew 27:24). Thus, the attribution of a redemptory role to the death of the righteous Miriam, paralleling it to the ritual of 'eglah 'arufah substituted by the author of Sefer Gematriyot (instead of the traditional prooftext relating to the red heifer), is not accidental. Moreover, it seems that the initial tradition linking the death of Miriam and the redemptory qualities of the red heifer, as it appears in tra ditional Jewish homiletics, might have had a polemical role as well. The statement emanating from such an affiliation is quite clear. While Christians claim that the death of Jesus is the ultimate act of expiation, Jews, by way of contrast, claim that during the ante-destruction period the red heifer ritual had an expiatory effect and that once the Temple was destroyed (70 C.E.), and the ceremony invol ving the red heifer's ashes had passed into memory, the death of truly righteous figures (like Miriam) began to bear this burden of expiation—and not the death of Jesus. During the 'eglah 'arufah ritual, now associated with the death of Miriam, the Jewish elders were obliged to recite the following: "And they shall declare: 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done. Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, Lord, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.'"28 Associ ating this text with the empowered figure of Miriam seems to suggest that what is at work here is by no means coincidental, but rather intentional. It appears to be a clear Jewish attempt to reinterpret the role of Miriam and portray her as towering and more powerful than the Virgin Maiy and even Jesus himself, and attribute to 28. Deuteronomy 21:7-8. 85</page><page sequence="12">EphraimEphraim Shoham-Steiner her in a subtle manner the expiatory powers that both redeem the Jews from pre vious accusations, and meet the external challenge formidably. This tradition was apparently well-absorbed by medieval Ashkenazi authors. The empowered role of Miriam is also evident in a quote from the late thirteenth-century Ashkenazi Sefer ha-Kushiyot that refers to the exact same issue. While discussing the custom of washing the hands after interring a body at a cemetery, the anonymous author of the Sefer ha-Kushiyot made the following remark: The reason we wash our hands (after interring the dead in the cemetery) is because their [the deceased] death has expiating qualities [and we learn this] from 'eglah 'arufah for we have a correlation between the two instances in which the word "sham" appears. The issue of 'eglah 'arufah that shares that word as well. And in 'eglah 'arufah [we also have the ritual of washing the hands with water] it is said: "Wash their hands over the heifer" (Deuteronomy 21:6).29 The discussion is formulated in the traditional Jewish homiletic form. The common word in the two remote issues draws the homilist to the text and creates the concep tual meeting point. Once established, the road is open to transferring concepts back and forth between both issues, a method known as gezerah shava. Usually gezerah shavashava is invoked when it can be substantiated from an existing tradition in this case the author had nit drawn on any existing tradition but rather used the method rather liberally. It seems the author of Sefer ha-Kushiyot has already appropriated the trope from the Sefer Gematriyot and was familiar with the link between the death of the righteous and 'eglah 'arufah and the expiating qualities attributed to the death of the righteous (in our case Miriam). The author then goes on to explain the reason for the common custom of washing one's hands upon departure from a funeral at the cemetery. The novel explanation involving Miriam's merit and presenting her as a tow ering figure that was provided by the thirteenth-century Ashkenazi Tashbez for the custom of spilling out the water present in the house where a person has just died fits rather neatly into a larger theme prompted by the growing awareness and need to react, if not outright compete, with the Marian cult. The method in this case is a subtle one. It recognizes the challenge and matches it with its almost exact parallel, and by slightly modifying existing tropes, it procures the desired outcome. It perhaps also suggests that a notion that evolved and emerged either in female circles or in order to explain typically female practices (e.g. the drawing of water at the end of the Sabbath) was by the late thirteenth century, when Tashbez Tashbez was compiled, ascribed to a gender-neutral practice. Nonetheless, it had provided a good platform for promoting a new role for an existing female character. 29.

To the best of my knowledge, the sole mention of Miriam later than the fourteenth century is with reference to whether one should mention a patient's name when praying for his or her recovery. Rabbi Shalom of Neustadt, a fifteenth century Austrian rabbi, refers to the prayer recited by Moses to heal Miriam's leprosy ("Please, God, heal her"—Numbers 12:13) as proof that when friends and kin assemble by the bedside of an ill person and recite prayers for recovery, the patient's name should not be recited, just as Moses had not mentioned his sister Miriam's name explicitly when he prayed for her recovery but rather referred to her using the third-person feminine pronoun lah, meaning "her."30 Apart from this mention, Miriam is not to be referred to, at least not by name. In the same Proven9al custom manual mentioned earlier (Orhot Hayim) one can find what appears as a change in the attitude towards the role of Miriam. When discussing the rituals of death and mourning, the author of Orhot Orhot Hayim, who was properly conversant with medieval Ashkenazi ideas, cited the custom recorded by the Tashbez of spilling out water which was in proxi mity to the dead. His explanation of the custom is different from the reason suggested by the Tashbez himself. In his mind, the reason for spilling the water is to spread the word of the death without verbally uttering the news: "And it is customary to spill all drawn water in the neighborhood of the deceased, the reason being to signify to all that a death has occurred. For there is no need to utter it [the news of the death] in the mouth since it is like slander, and it is said: 'Whoever ... spreads slander is a fool' (Proverbs 10:18)." The spilling of the water signified to the community that a death had occurred, using a language of symbols without actually verbalizing what had happened. Only after giving the reason did the author state the existence of another opinion: that the origin of the custom has to do with the Angel of Death cleansing his sword in the water. At this point he alluded to a possible scriptural prooftext as the basis for the custom: "It is said: 'And Miriam died there and was buried there (Numbers 20),' and later it is said: 'And the community was without water,' the reason being that all had spilled out their water [due to her death]." No mention is made of Miriam's merit besides the use of the verse as prooftext.31 30. See: Rabbi Shalom b. Issac Zekel of Neustadt, Minhagei Maharash, ed. S.Y.

Although Aaron ha-Kohen's authorship is questioned, the Provan?al origins of the book are not. 87</page><page sequence="14">EphraimEphraim Shoham-Steiner The Orhot Hayim s account demonstrates that not only did the author fully absorb the association between Miriam and spilling water found in the Ashkenazi TashbezTashbez a generation earlier, but that he already ascribed this custom to the Israe lites themselves, thus overriding the midrashic notion of Miriam's well, prompted by the proximity between the account of Miriam's death and the Israelites' thirst. In his eyes, the thirst of which the Bible speaks was caused by the fact that every one spilled out their water upon Miriam's death. It almost seems as if this remark was designed to cast the entire practice into the realm of the absurd.32 Such an extreme change in attitude in this relatively short time span must be based on some sort of significant rationale. One possible reasoning could stem from the fact that the outright attacks and attempts to direct anathematic language at the Virgin Mary proved to be counter-productive. As Israel Yuval has noted, the use of graphic anti-Marian language in prayers like 'alenu le-shabeah had begun to dissolve, probably because it drew the attention of Christians who, in turn, accused Jews of being blasphemous towards their saints in general, and the Virgin Mary in particular.33 This explanation should, however, only magnify our perplexity, for the rise in the role of Miriam is remote from being an outright attack on the Virgin Mary. It is probably a more subtle way of meeting the Marian challenge, almost not admitting it, yet dealing with it covertly by empowering the figure of Miriam in Jewish European sources form the twelfth century, and associ ating her image with water. Israel Ta-Shma was not only the first to notice the link between these matters and the Marian cult, but was also the first to notice their gradual disappearance and eventual omission, especially with regard to the female custom of drawing water at the end of the Sabbath. In his concluding argument on this topic, he noted: I tend to link the appearance of the custom to the emergence of miraculous healing springs associated with the name of the Christian Mary...Jews attempted to explain the healing abilities [of the water sources] if they were 'real' with the link to the 'well of Miriam'. The disappearance of the custom I tend to associate with the horrors of the Black Death and the well and water source poisoning libel with which Jews were accused. In its after math, a nocturnal gathering of Jewish women at wells on Saturday night might have rendered such attempts perilous if not outright lethal. However so far these are only speculations.34 Although Ta-Shma may have been right in suggesting the link between the new Jewish custom and "the emergence of miraculous springs associated with ... Mary" and its gradual disappearance related to the Black Death, the scope of the phenomenon he pointed out is not as limited as he had thought; the explanation 32. A similar idea appears in the new edition of the Tashbez published recently, see Shimshon ben Zadok Sefer Tashbez, ed. S. Engel (Jerusalem: Makhon Yerushalyim, 2011) § 464. 33. See Yuval, Two Nations, 195, n. 129. 34. Israel Moshe Ta-Shma, Minhag Ashkenaz ha-kadmon (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 19942), 216.</page><page sequence="15">The Virgin Mary, Miriam, and Jewish Reactions he gave falls short of providing us with a sufficient answer to the gradual disap pearance of Miriam from later Jewish sources. Moreover, even if one accepts Ta-Shma's argumentation and relate the disappearance of the water-drawing customs to the perils of the Black Death, explanation for both the association of Miriam with the custom of spilling the water, which was carried out privately and not in the public eye, and for the broader scope of references to the Jewish reaction to the Marian challenge is still wanting. It, therefore, seems that the dis appearance of Miriam has less to do with the figure of Miriam per se, and more to do with the change in the manner in which the figure of Mary was perceived in Christian society, which also occurred in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. By the late thirteenth century, Mary was no longer seen as the possible link or conduit between the Jews and Christianity. Her image, once associated with the hand extended to converts, became more commonly depicted as protector of those offended and supposedly victimized by Jews.35 From this period on, another aspect of this change can be found in the fact that in late medieval Germany Jewish quarters that were razed to the ground and synagogues that were appro priated from expelled Jewish communities were then dedicated to the Virgin Mary.36 For example, we have the well-documented case of the Regensburg Jewish quarter, which was leveled in 1519 following the Jews' expulsion from the city (February 1519). The area confiscated was dedicated to Schone Maria, "the Fair Virgin Mary."37 Thus Mary became the signifier of the annihilation of 35. Denis L.

The role of the Virgin Mary as a formidable enemy of the Jews, and at times even instigator of outright violence against them, can be seen in Marian plays and theatrical enactments that took place in the town squares and cathedral plazas all over Western Christendom. These plays, many of which were associated with the cult of the Virgin, were fig uratively anti-Jewish and extremely violent in conveying their anti-Jewish mess ages, as recently shown by Merrall L. Price.38 In the more private sphere, illuminated books of meditation and prayer dedicated by devotees to the Virgin, which were more common in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, depict the Jews in the most monstrous and savage ways and suggest a graphic intolerance toward them.39 Mary's figure came to signify that Jews could no longer be toler ated in Western Europe, and one aspect of her cult became the religious expression of this idea.40 It seems that the once possibly tempting challenge for the Jews, Mary, was gradually being redefined, and her figure assumed a different nature. She no longer was a threat to Jews by her appeal, charity, and seductive influence. In these vest ments her challenge might have caused Jews to deliberate and at times fully succumb to the persuasive arguments for conversion encapsulated in her figure. By the fourteenth century, this was no longer the case. Accordingly, the role attrib uted by Jews to the figure that was supposed to fend off the Marian challenge, Miriam, was no longer in need and she gradually faded away. *** Although some scholars have argued that there are only "a few (surprisingly few) Jewish sources that directly address Mary's position in the Christian history of salvation and her emerging cult,"41 it seems that a wide and diverse reaction to the cult of the Virgin Mary is by no means in need of proof. The search for evi dence of the direct polemic evidence is not the only means of uncovering the 391-403, esp. 393 and fig. 43. Figure 43 shows a woodcut by Michael Ostendorfer depicting a religious procession dedicated to the Virgin passing by the decimated houses of the former Jewish quarter.

There is much more to meeting the Marian challenge than direct attacks on the Virgin Mary, her cult, or the per suasive aspects of her cult that Jews might have thought of as appealing. Jews dealt with this challenge in a variety of ways, some more subtle than others, and there fore alongside the outright polemical manifestation we should look for quieter means, such as the internal empowerment of Jewish female figures such as Miriam. Internal Jewish sources, including custom manuals and other books designed for a larger, more diverse readership, provide suggestive evidence in this respect. These sources, especially, homiletic works, demonstrate that Jews drew on the biblical and midrashic images of Miriam in order to simultaneously supplant and respond to the perceived power and allure of the competing Christian traditions of the biblical Miriam's namesake—Virgin Mary. By identifying the tension between the competing interests in which Jewish authors promote what they saw as authentic and ancient traditions on this issue, one can pinpoint other ways in which Jews confronted the Marian challenge, by means other than outright polemic. Amplifying and empowering the role of Miriam and constructing new tropes in order to respond and repel traditions from without is but one possible avenue Jews could have applied to meet the Virgin^ match with a fascinating spurt of creativity. These ideas were designed to deflect the threat of a powerful and suggestive religious tradition that presented a formidable challenge for Jews. In this middle ground the image of Miriam rose as a subject common to the true religious traditions, precisely because each of the two religions was already invested in the theme, alluding to the same prooftexts yet applying a different hermeneutical tool kit.
