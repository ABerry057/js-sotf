Brill, 1992. xv, 489 pp. This book represents dilettantism gone wild. At best, it could pass for a seminary middler's term paper. The text reveals a complete lack of skill in the proper handling of ancient sources, both written and archaeological. In the 1980s much of biblical scholarship wasted its time chasing its tail around the theory that the Israelites were nothing but former Canaanite peasants. Now, in the 1990s, the new fad is to explain away the monarchies of the First Temple period and any records that may have survived therefrom. The moral of this development, as also of the former "revolting peasant theory," is that biblical scholars should be required to do some serious ancient Near Eastern study. They should first have to deal with materials from the real world, e.g., some ancient archives, such as the Ugarit administrative and legal texts, the Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, or the Amarna letters This would serve to restrain the unbridled imagination reflected by T. L. Thompson's Early History of the Israelite People. Thompson is the apparent guru of the new "uncritical" biblical critics.' His book is based on a series of assumptions: (1) the ethnic composition of the population of Palestine was relatively unchanged throughout the ages (chap. 5); (2) the "United Monarchy" of Saul, David, and Solomon was a fiction created by later biblical tradition (p. 412); (3) biblical Hebrew was an artificial creation in the Persian period, thus all biblical sources are Persian-period compositions. None of these assumptions is supportable by the evidence. 1. E.g., P. R. Davies, In Search of "Ancient Israel". Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Supplement Series 148.

One of the most glaring examples of Thompson's dilettantism is the allusion to "West Semitic influence in early Egyptian" (p. 176, n. 23). This statement is not supported by linguistic examples or even by reference to studies by acknowledged linguists; the "authority" is Thompson's own Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives (1974) without even a page number where one might find such linguistic data! As a matter of fact, the most striking feature of "early Egyptian" (Old Egyptian) is the suffix conjugation, the use of which is strongly similar to the form and function of the same suffix conjugation in Akkadian, i.e., East Semitic, not West Semitic. It is obvious from Thompson's discussion of the "Green Sahara" (pp. 171-177) that he has read a lot (as usual) but is merely citing opinions expressed in the discussion without any first-hand knowledge of the languages or the linguistic data involved. This foray into the problems of Afroasiatic linguistics is typical of his approach to every discipline dealt with in this book: he is an outsider picking and choosing details that support his preconceived notions. Concerning the population of Palestine, Thompson completely ignores the role of this country as a land bridge. It always attracted peoples from the four corners of the ancient world, just as it served as a catchall for refugees from throughout the Arab world under the Ottoman Empire (e.g., those who fled there in the wake of the French occupation of North Africa, or the Muslim Greeks who came to the Levant from Crete when Greece gained its independence). In antiquity, one remembers the influx of people who brought the Khirbet Kerak ware in the late third millennium. The presence of Hurrian and Indo-European personal names in the Late Bronze Age (e.g., in the Taanach and Amarna texts) is sharply contrasted with the thoroughly West Semitic repertoire of the Middle Bronze Age documents (execration texts, etc.). Thompson tries to play down the arrival of the Philistines (citing the ideas of G. Ahlstrom); the facts of that invasion must give way to Thompson's (and Ahlstrom's) preconceived notion. The influx of Arameans in the central and northern Levant in the Early Iron Age is the obvious corollary to the arrival of the Israelites in the southern Levant. Thompson cannot tolerate the reference to an ethnic group called "Israel" in the Merneptah Stele (p. 139), again basing his opposition on G. Ahlstrom. That "Israel" in that text might</page><page sequence="3">158 BOOK REVIEWS refer to a geographic area and not a people is a purely amateurish fantasy.2 Of course, the principal motive for defending the thesis that the population of Palestine never changed is to deny the arrival of the Israelites. Thompson and his colleagues are really advocates of the Gottwald thesis in spite of their attempts to disassociate themselves from it. One could go on to mention the Edomites who crossed the Arabah to settle in the Hebron hills and the Negev, or the tribe of the Ituraeans who settled in the northern part of the country. Those Persian/Hellenistic movements were following the precedents of earlier ages. In short, the backbone of Thompson's book, the thesis that Palestinian history is the record of the changing fortunes of a constant population, is pure fiction based on a refusal to face the real evidence. As for the ancient states in the land of Israel, Thompson has to admit that the northern kingdom must have existed as early as the ninth century B.C.E. because its king, "Ahab the Israelite," is mentioned in an inscription from the reign of Shalmaneser III. The state of Judah, on the other hand, does not fare so well. It is viewed as a minor appendage to the northern kingdom, a state which only came into its own after the fall of Samaria. The United Monarchy is denied out of hand (pp. 409-410). Thompson and his associates will doubtless go to great lengths to deny the relevance of the recently discovered epigraphic allusions to the "House of David" in ninth-century B.C.E. inscriptions (the Aramaic stele fragment from Dan and the Mesha Stele).3 That the Judean monarchy was obviously known to neighboring peoples in the ninth century as the "House of David," i.e., as the dynasty of its tenth-century founder, becomes a devastating rebuttal to Thompson's view about Jerusalem and about the kingdom of Judah. What is sad in all this is that Thompson seems oblivious to the solid internal evidence from a geographical text such as 1 Kings 4:7-20, which defines the dichotomy between the original tribal ("Israelite") areas of northern Israel in the hilly regions and the newly acquired formerly "Hivvite and Canaanite" (1 Sam. 24:7) enclaves in the lowlands. This sociological reality is also expressed in the two forms of public works organized to carry out the Solomonic building 2. Cf. A. F.

Is this an invented detail? Thompson will doubtless reply that these passages cannot be used as evidence since there really is no evidence. Thompson has dabbled in historical geography,5 but he has never demonstrated any true understanding of how its rules of evidence function. On the broader plane of Near Eastern history, the fact that Egypt and Mesopotamia were still in decline during the tenth century B.C.E. makes a perfect backdrop for the rise of territorial states in the Levant. There is nothing intrinsically implausible in the rise of United Israel and its dominant role in the southern Levant for two generations. The Shishak inscription, inscribed in conjunction with the building of the Bubasite portal at Karnak after that king's first year (925 B.C.E.), reflects an Egyptian campaign against Israel no later than 925 B.C.E. It is hardly coincidental that 925 is the fifth year of Rehoboam (and Jeroboam I) according to the chronology in Kings. The biblical story of Jerusalem's paying tribute to Shishak (1 Kings 14:25-28; 2 Chron. 12:2-12) also fits well with the appearance of Gibeon in the list of towns on Shishak's list. From there, Shishak probably carried on the negotiations for the ransom paid by Rehoboam. The chronological indicators (including the Shishak and Shalmaneser III inscriptions, 925 and 841 respectively) for 931/930 B.C.E. as the date of the founding of the separate northern and southern administrations are ignored by Thompson.6 In fact, there is a section entitled "Biblical Chronology" (pp. 366-372), but chronology is not really discussed-this is typical of the book as a whole, bombastic titles and subtitles with no content of value. One of Thompson's supporting assumptions for his bold thesis is the study by E. A. Knauf in which biblical Hebrew is discounted as an invention of scribes of the Persian period.7 On that score, suffice it to say that the Mesha Stone inscription is composed in a narrative prose discourse style 4.

The idea that such a literary discourse style was not in use in literate circles in Judah and Israel in the ninth and eighth centuries (and also in the tenth, for that matter) is nonsense. Only the most gullible could believe such a thing. The gradual breakdown of the morphosyntax of this discourse style is clearly evident in the real postexilic literature; but even the Qumranites tried, with varying degrees of success, to imitate the preexilic language. Incidentally, the Siloam inscription has some of the same morphosyntax as the biblical narrative prose. Is it so strange that the preexilic Temple in Jerusalem or the royal administration or private circles (such as prophets) could also have engaged in literary activity? The epigraphic material from Judah and Israel is admittedly scanty, but it reflects enough genres (administrative: the Samaria ostraca; epistolary: the Lachish and Arad letters, the 'Ajrud graffiti; curses and imprecations: Silwan, Judean wilderness cave) to show that a wide range of literary forms was practiced. That such libraries continued to exist in the Persian period is a natural consequence of a centuries-old tradition. It belies the origin of all the biblical literature in the Persian period. After reading Thompson's monograph one can only express longing and appreciation for the down-to-earth common sense of Morton Smith!8 To conclude, Thompson's book deserves to be forgotten. However, given the nature of biblical studies divorced from the rigorous discipline of ancient Near Eastern studies, there is every likelihood that Thompson and his thesis will not be ignored. This reviewer once lamented to Israel Eph'al that historical geography was almost completely neglected by biblical scholars outside of Israel. His reply (fifteen years ago) was that serious biblical history was no less neglected. Biblical scholarship in the 1990s is faced with a choice: either it can choose the easy road and follow the lead of the likes of Thompson, or it can engage in serious linguistic and philological study of ancient Near Eastern history, a grueling path indeed.
