As we take up our duties, we first salute our predecessors, Professors Martin Jaffee and Hillel Kieval, on the high quality of the journal now entrusted to us. They have set us a model of dili gence and excellence that we shall be hard pressed to match. They have our admiration and our gratitude. Our thanks go as well to Professor Charlotte Fonrobert for her labors in the office of Book Review Editor. It is no easy task to get reviews into print before the books under discussion go out of print, and we are pleased to report that Professor Fonrobert has kindly agreed to remain in her post. The AJS Review could not possibly appear as it does, on schedule and well produced, without the efforts of the AJS staff, headed by Executive Director Rona Sheramy. We thank outgoing Managing Editor Sarah Massey for her tireless efforts over the past years and wish her success in her new position. We look forward to working with Stanley Mirvis, the incoming managing editor. * * * We have inherited a distinguished journal, and for this we are deeply grate ful. Building on this strong foundation, we would like the AJS Review to reflect the full spectrum of our members' scholarly interests in all their variety while main taining and even raising our academic standards. We turn to you, our readers, the members of the AJS, to send us your finest work and to encourage your col leagues to do the same. As time goes on, we hope to introduce some new features to the AJS Review, and we welcome your input and comments. To celebrate a new chapter in the history of this distinguished journal, we are fortunate to have the artwork of the noted illustrator Mark Podwal gracing our cover, and we thank him for his generosity to the AJS Review. His work embodies the combination of deep Jewish literacy, graceful execution, and the leap of imagination that symbolize our aspirations for the dynamic, fluid, and challenging field that is Jewish studies. Elisheva Carlebach and Robert Goldenberg 1</page></plain_text>
