<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marvin Fox. Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy. Chicago Studies in the History of Judaism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990. xiii, 356 pp. From its opening pages, Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy by Marvin Fox presents the author's attempt to confront the ongoing intellectual and existential challenges posed by Maimonides, some 800 years after the publication of the Guide of the Perplexed. I emphasize the existential as well as the intellectual dimensions of the Maimonidean legacy because Fox has clearly sought to engage Rambam in areas, such as the limitations of reason, the foundations of ethics, and God's relation to the world, which transcend purely historical, academic significance and continue to touch on our lives. The book therefore concludes with an impassioned epilogue, "The Significance of Maimonides for Contemporary Judaism."' 1. Unfortunately, this essay is unlikely to be read by those in greatest need of it, contemporary Jews for whom the traditions of Judaism are of no interest, and traditionally minded Jews for whom contemporary culture has no intrinsic value.</page><page sequence="2">208 BOOK REVIEWS Interpreting Maimonides, then, is not merely scholarship, but a philo- sophic encounter with Maimonides as a living teacher. Fox engages Mai- monides in dialogue, and involves the reader in the dialogue as well. The book is, additionally, a fine pedagogic tool in terms of both style and content. The clarity of Fox's language and arguments will make it useful not only to scholars and specialists but also to students and generalists. Fox often begins a chapter by comparing Maimonides' theories to the classical formulations of the Bible and the rabbis, or of philosophers such as Aristotle and Aquinas, and by contrasting his own interpretations with those of other modern scholars, most notably Leo Strauss. Fox candidly admits it when his interpretation is not shared by "most scholars," and when, after more than twenty years of working on a problem, the solution still eludes him. He also notes the dangers inherent in studying Maimonides, given the esoteric nature of the Guide of the Perplexed, and compounded by "the fact that Maimonides is a name of such overarching stature and authority that almost every interpreter seeks support for a personal point of view by claiming to find it in Maimonides" (p. 2). "The Jewish scholars seem to look to Maimonides to validate and authenticate their individual understanding of Judaism in a way that is not paralleled by even the most devoted interpreters of other philosophers," Fox says, and then adds: "Whether the present book has succeeded in freeing itself from this regrettable tendency to recreate Maimonides in the image of the author will have to be judged by its readers" (p. 4, n. 2). While recognizing the danger of recreating Maimonides in his own image (a danger which I think he succeeds in avoiding), Fox clearly does identify with him, explicitly in the epilogue, and perhaps implicitly elsewhere.2 But it is precisely this feature of the book, engaging Maimonides directly, which makes it such lively as well as informative reading. Existentially identifying with Maimonides does not preclude intellectual honesty in seeking Maimonides' peshat, and one need not always agree with Fox's conclusion (e.g., on the rationality of the commandments and the moral law)3 to admire the clarity of his argument and his close reading of the text. 2. For example, "If neither natural science nor divine science can provide us with a satisfactory exposition of God as cause of the world, then we may legitimately seek guidance and instruction from the text of revelation itself. This is just what Maimonides advises his readers to do" (p. 247). 3. For example, Fox (pp. 131 ff.) reads Maimonides' critique (in his Eight Chapters on Ethics, chap. 6) of Sa'adiah Ga'on's category of "rational commandments" as evidence of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 209 Throughout Interpreting Maimonides, Fox consistently applies his hermeneutic principle of "dialectical tension" (with devastating effect on Strauss). According to Fox, Maimonides chose "to eschew the way of 'either/or' and to adopt instead the way of 'both/and'. .. . Opposed views may each have so much to recommend them that we must commit ourselves to both and hold them in a balanced dialectical tension" (pp. 22-23). Maimonides thus affirms both "the claims of reason" (p. 43) and its limits. What others, like Strauss, saw as contradictions (setirot, which logically cannot both be true or both false), Fox sees as "divergences" (hilufim): When we do not have a genuine contradiction but, as in the case of prayer, a divergence between a religious commandment and a philosophically demon- strated principle, then Maimonides teaches us the great art of balancing the two. To know how to keep them in balance and to live with the tension is precisely what is required of the religious man who seeks and discovers philosophical truth. We should never forget that it is to just such a person that Maimonides addresses his great work. ... Here again the model is that of Maimonides himself, who exemplifies for us the way in which a Jew who is a philosopher finds his way through the divergence by balancing, in an on-going tension, the demands of both worlds. (pp. 80-81)4 Of course, Fox's interpretations, while they answer many questions, raise some others. Two examples will suffice, from those areas (methodology and ethics) which are among Fox's most original contributions and most forceful arguments. In terms of general methodology, historically it may well be true that Maimonides sought a "balanced tension" of "divergences" in his life, but the coherence of a theory presumably rests (at least in good measure) on a rather higher degree of logical consistency, and one wonders whether Rambam's denial of the rationality of moral law and judgments (in the strict sense of the term, as opposed to a more general, utilitarian "reasonableness" after the fact of revelation); the category, Fox argues, is erroneous because no commandments are (strictly) rational. Others read this text and Maimonides' theory quite differently. For example, Isadore Twersky writes of this passage: "Maimonides objected strenuously to those predecessors who said that some commandments were rational laws. . . . His strenuous objection is nourished by his own passionate conviction that not some but all laws are rational" (Introduction to the Code of Maimonides [New Haven, 1980], p. 458). 4. The principle of dialectical tension is also invoked, for example, on the questions of divine causality (p. 249), creation (pp. 293-296), and prayer (pp. 297, 319).</page><page sequence="4">210 BOOK REVIEWS Maimonides himself did not think he had attained it, or at least strived for it, even when (as in the case of his discussion of creation) Maimonides regarded the arguments as persuasive rather than conclusively demonstrative. How far is it from "balanced tension" to the kind of "double truth" to which Maimonides surely would have objected strenuously? In terms of the rationality of law and the relations between law and morality, if it is true that the divine law cannot be subjected to the "external evaluations" of conventional human moral standards, but that "the divine law alone is morality" (pp. 225-226), is not the result a kind of halakhic positivism to which Maimonides surely was opposed and against which he rebelled?5 However these and other questions are resolved, Interpreting Maimonides will stimulate continued scholarly discussion, and will serve the needs of both research and teaching in the years to come. Fox has enriched us with this guide to the perplexities of Maimonides. Raphael Jospe Open University of Israel Jerusalem, Israel 5. Cf. Guide of the Perplexed 3:25, where Maimonides argues that God's actions cannot be futile, frivolous, or vain, and that God wills "only that which is required by his wisdom to be such. ... All these acts are consequent upon his wisdom."</page></plain_text>
