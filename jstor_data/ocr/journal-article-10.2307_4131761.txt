<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Eli Gordon. Rosenzweig and Heidegger: Between Judaism and German Phi- losophy. Berkeley, University of California Press, 2003. 357 pp. This important study of Franz Rosenzweig is among the first book-length forays into the silence surrounding Martin Heidegger in modern Jewish thought. 405</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In seeking to establish an elective affinity between these two thinkers, Gordon subverts the firewall established by Karl L6with between Rosenzweig's passion for eternity and Heidegger's focus on the pure temporality of human existence (Dasein). In doing so, he bucks the link in contemporary Jewish philosophy be- tween Rosenzweig and Levinas, in which an ethics based on a good beyond Be- ing upends ontology as first philosophy. In Gordon's reading, eternity is to the Jewish people as Dasein is to Being. Jewish existence, understood ontological- ly, not metaphysically, assumes the uncanny, ungrounded, and self-sustaining character of Heideggerian authenticity. Ontologically radical, eternity thus be- comes like time, a this-worldly framework, constituting the ultimate horizon of redemption. The match between Rosenzweig and Heidegger is an uneven philosophical, cum cultural mix-up. Gordon illuminates common philosophical features shared by both thinkers: the antiplatonic elan, the critique of scientific positivism and his- toricism, the introduction of archaic elements to irradiate modern consciousness, the significance ascribed to the individual and death, time and language, being and nothingness. To be sure, critical readers will note that all these hallmarks identi- fied were such standard fixtures of late Wilhelmine culture as to render the pres- ence of Heidegger and Weimar superfluous. In "Vertauschte Fronten" (1929), Rosenzweig notes the affinity between himself and Heidegger. But I suspect that here, as elsewhere, Rosenzweig was inclined to overdraw tenuous associations be- tween himself and others (e.g., Hermann Cohen, Judah Halevy). The conversation between Rosenzweig and Heidegger depends on funda- mental contrasts raised and then dropped by Gordon, most notably the difference between beings and being. For Rosenzweig in part I of The Star of Redemption, world and "man" and even God are ontic phenomena. Unlike Heidegger, Rosen- zweig never pursues the ontological question of Being and questions regarding the type of being we are. Nor, conversely, is Rosenzweig particularly engaged by "the nothing" that for Heidegger constitutes an existential condition of possibility. Rosenzweig does not accord "primacy" to "nothing," as Gordon insists he does (174), because for Rosenzweig, nothing refers not to the naught of our existence but to our first knowledge and its operation prior to what we can formally know about God, world, and person. The key term that marks the thought of God, world, and "man" is neither all nor nothing, but something. The more important insight raised by Gordon concerns time. In subverting L6with's scheme, Gordon goes beyond the basic point that for Rosenzweig eterni- ty is enmeshed in temporal structures. His more radical counterclaim that theology and ontology are "identical" with time is one that flattens the one into the other (235). Comparing the circular flow of time to blood, a central image of Jewish peo- plehood for Rosenzweig, Gordon neglects the fact that for Rosenzweig time stops dead and coagulates. Death has lost its theatrical character as a cosmic, ontic event (166). As the utmost ontological possibility defining human being-in-the-world, it becomes too much like time. And so almost does God. Very late in the text, Gor- don concedes that Rosenzweig's understanding of God remains atemporal (190, 235). Had this atemporal dimension been introduced earlier and less grudgingly, the mismatch between Rosenzweig and Heidegger would have assumed an altered cast. 406</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews In drawing a line connecting Rosenzweig and Heidegger-Rosenzweig and German modernism-Gordon insists that Rosenzweig was not a Jewish thinker and that Judaism was for him "merely [a] medium" (307, 36, 311-13). Flouting the fundamental importance that both Rosenzweig and Heidegger ascribed to linguistic form in relation to content, Gordon's claim is based on one isolated prooftext in "The New Thinking," where Rosenzweig asserts that The Star ofRe- demption, is not a Jewish book. In refusing to read this statement critically (as what? the desire to reach out to a broader readership? wounded vanity that only Jews had bothered to purchase the book, most of whom never saw anything in it past a call to keep kosher kitchens?), Gordon ignores the aggressive particularism that first drove Rosenzweig to Judaism; and he feeds the very parochial division between Judaism and "Germanism" that Rosenzweig rejected out of hand after the publication of his magnum opus. Rosenzweig and Heidegger remains a remarkable book. Its chief virtue is to drag the former into German studies and continental philosophy and the latter into modern Jewish thought. Gordon has broken a serious taboo by violating the philo- sophical and historical antipathies and loyalties expressed by L6with and Levinas regarding Heidegger and the Holocaust. If Gordon carries modern Jewish thought towards a still active and important philosophical center, many in the field will continue to dig in their heels. They will maintain a critical distance for good philo- sophical reasons, not just for the political ones dismissed too quickly by Gordon (19). However, they will have to do so simultaneous to this groundbreaking work to reflect seriously about time, space, and language.
