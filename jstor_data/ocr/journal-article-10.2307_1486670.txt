Sodom is usually seen as a biblical Fire Island, an abode of homosexuals so ardent in their perversion that they are willing to violate the Near Eastern custom of hospitality to assault Lot's guests. But, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz asks us, what if the men of Sodom knew Lot's visitors were divine? Then their wanting to "know" them might indicate a desire for union with the divine. And why not? When the bnei 'elohim copulated with the daughters of men (Gen 6:1-4), no one thought the worse of it. And offering his daughters to his neighbors makes no sense unless the latter are bisexual. The traditional explanation, then, is at least incomplete. Coming on the heels of The Savage in Judaism, God's Phallus establishes Eilberg-Schwartz as the stormy petrel of Jewish theology, asking questions and raising issues that have hardly been touched upon previously. He proposes that "various myths and rituals of ancient Judaism attempted to suppress the homoereotic male impulse implicit in the male relationship with God" (p. 3). Some will say, as the author acknowledges, that this book is a projection of his own psychological struggles, perhaps a justification for behavior that became, if it was not always, forbidden to Israelite men. To say this, however, is to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Eilberg-Schwartz claims that Israel was the first society in which God was seen as a Father. If the (male) worshipper is commanded to "love" the Father, how can the suggestion of physical love and the concomitant feminization of men be avoided? Further, if men have this feminine role, what becomes</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 165 of Israelite women? As he puts it, "To be a man of God involves imagining oneself as a woman" (p. 163). And what of the recurrent metaphor of Israel whoring after other gods? The sexual language, e.g., Ezekiel 16, is explicit. Metaphor means "near the appearance"; Eilberg-Schwartz asks us to ask ourselves, how near? He also spends much time discussing the passages dealing with God's physical appearance. Mormons, perhaps, will applaud this seeming assent to the proposition that ancient Israel's God had a body, but the author does not mean us to accept this position uncritically. Rather he is more interested in the idea that not all of us are made in God's image, and that actually to see a male God is an erotic experience that calls human maleness into question. The title of this chapter, "Women Rabbis and the Orchard of Heavenly Delights," is double-edged for those who know that the author is now divorced from Rabbi Amy Eilberg. Which brings us back to the dilemma of trying to evaluate this work separately from what we know of its author. If this is, say, step two of his twelve-step program for freeing himself from the strictures of traditional Judaism, it is yet commendable for the enormous effort and openness that undergird the writing. He could have just walked away. After seeing God, Moses became celibate. Readers might be surprised by the novel explanation that Miriam and Aaron's concern for Moses' Cushite wife had to do with his physical neglect of her after encountering the divine. Eilberg-Schwartz writes, "one cannot be both a man and a lover of God" (p. 146). To love God, a man must, perforce, be feminine. Disturbing as it is, the book must be read on its own merits, which are considerable. Though it is chockablock with quotations from the text, commentaries, and modern commentators, Eilberg-Schwartz maintains steer- ageway. The book is readable despite the at times talmudic complexity of the arguments. The notes are full and easily accessible. One reading is insufficient to digest it. What bothers this reader most about the book might be said of all modern theologies; they level the Bible, reading it synchronically despite its having been written over a period of a thousand years. Add the commentaries and what you have is a vast Jewish department store in which everyone's interests-and derashimn-are well represented. The interest in male-divine homoeroticism here is well-nigh relentless, though never prurient. Others will point out that the countervailing notion of the Shekhinah, God's "presence" represented by a feminine noun, is too easily dismissed (see pp. 190-191).</page><page sequence="3">166 BOOK REVIEWS I can imagine the response to God's Phallus being similar to that given Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, and to the work of Freud, whom Eilberg- Schwartz uses extensively; it's true, and so a scandal that will paint Jews as polymorphously perverse among Gentiles (who think that they themselves aren't). Despite this danger, we are left with a very real question: in the face of a male/Father God, how do men recognize and embrace the feminine in themselves and at the same time keep from excluding women? The questions, seemingly, are not new. Stanley N. Rosenbaum Dickinson College Carlisle, Pa.</page></plain_text>
