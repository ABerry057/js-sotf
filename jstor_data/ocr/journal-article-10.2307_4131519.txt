In Jewish studies there have been few opportunities to consolidate the various advances made in the study of the Jewish book, and even fewer to contextualize the Jewish book fully within the history of the book at large. During the coming year, the fellows at CAJS will explore the Jewish book as a historical agent in Jewish culture and as a medium of exchange within the larger cultures in which Jews have lived. Applicants are invited from all disciplinary perspectives, with the aim of uniting scholars working in the traditional fields of Jewish studies with scholars of the history of the book. We anticipate that projects will deal with such questions as: * How have the materiality and formatting of Jewish texts from antiquity to the present shaped authorship, reception, interpretation, and transmission? * How have the business of Jewish book production and the market forces of book consumption affected Jewish life and culture? * How have the visual art in and design of Jewish books shaped reading habits, legibility, recollection, and signification? * How have cultures of Jewish reading changed over time, creating new forms of social experience and testing communal authority as well as gender boundaries? * What has been the fate of Jewish books, libraries, book producers, and readers under conditions of censorship and persecution? The Center invites applications from scholars in the humanities and social sciences at all levels, and will consider outstanding graduate students in the final stages of writing their dissertations. Stipend amounts are based on a fellow's academic standing and financial need with a maximum of $32,000 for the academic year. A contribution may also be made towards travel expenses. Application deadline is November 15, 2004. Awards will be announced by February 1, 2005.

[The Yom Kippur War's] revelations are astonishing. Its prose is grip- ping. Its conclusions, richly documented and austerely objective, are intensely relevant to the Middle Eastern crisis of our own day." -Howard M. Sachar, author of A History of Israel From the Rise of Zionism to Our Own Time Schocken I Cloth 1 544 pages I $27.50 Double Vision A Self-Portrait by Walter Abish "Walter Abish has written three classical novels. ... But his memoir, Double Vision, is his master- piece to date. Abish's life, in Austria, Italy, France, Shanghai, the early days of Israel, becomes a vivid parable of Jewish survival and of something beyond mere survival, the stub- born continuity of Jewish literary culture. Double Vision may well be a permanent achieve- ment. I venture that its relevance will prevail generations hence." -Harold Bloom Knopf I Cloth 1 240 pages 1 $24.00 The State of Israel vs. Adolf Eichmann by Hanna Yablonka "[A] groundbreaking contribution.

For those of us in the common-sense center, those of us who believed peace was imminent at Camp David and have been harrowed by the terrorism that followed, this book offers a vital dose of painful wisdom and realistic, tempered hope."-Samuel G.

Mothers and Children Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe Elisheva Baumgarten This book presents a synthetic history of the family-the most basic building block of medieval Jewish communities-in Germany and northern France during the High Middle Ages. Concentrating on the special roles of mothers and children, it also advances recent efforts to write a comparative Jewish-Christian social history. Cloth $39.50 ISBN 0-691-09166-8 Due June A Jewish Renaissance in Fifteenth-Century Spain Mark D. Meyerson This book significantly revises the conventional view that the Jewish experience in medieval Spain-over the century before the expulsion of 1492-was one of despair, persecution, and decline. Focusing on the town of Morvedre in the kingdom of Valencia, Mark Meyerson shows how and why its Jewish communi- ty revived and flourished in the wake of the horrible violence of 1391.
