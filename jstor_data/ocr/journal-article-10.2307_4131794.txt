New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. viii, 312 pp. Marc Gopin believes that religion can play an important role in forming a global society committed to peace and moral principles. He bases his belief on the fact that in most religions there is a "commitment to peace and elimination of vi- olence" (p. 30) expressed in a broad range of values. Through the "internal hermeneutic dynamics of the tradition" (p. 60)-that is, through a textual investi- gation of how traditions have changed-he believes that Muslims, Christians, Jews, and others can contribute to promoting peace. Although Gopin deals with other religious traditions, I will concentrate on the relationship between Judaism and Islam. Gopin argues that there is a common denominator in the literature of Islam and Judaism that could result in a resolution of the Middle East conflict. He shows that in the course of centuries of legal and religious reflection, in both traditions, there are trends that emphasize alternatives to conflict and promotion of ethical values related to "coexistence, peacemaking, and even pacifism" (pp. 66-67). As Gopin points out, in classical Jewish literature there is a tension between the pursuit of peace and of war. In the books of Deuteronomy and Kings, the Mish- nah, the Talmud, and Rabbinic literature, there is permission and even the re- quirement to go to war, although the first preference is "when coming close to a city to fight you have to call for peace" (Dt. 20:10). Commandments to the He- brew people not to make alliances with the nations in their midst nor to allow a soul among them to live (Dt. 7:1-5, 20, 15-18) were in reality not fulfilled and in- deed were negated in the Talmudic literature. In a similar vein, Gopin suggests, later sources in Islam modify the original conceptions of war and peace. "The Quranic uses of the term Jihad are only the first level of analysis of the Islamic approach to war. There are later distinctions between state Jihad and religious Jihad," he writes (p. 66). However, Gopin's discussion of traditional and contemporary Muslim thought is not supported by other modern scholars. Several examples that are particularly relevant to the Arab-Israel conflict contradict Gopin's ideal of a symmetry between Judaism and Islam. In eight of its chapters, the Koran enjoins the faithful to follow the path of Jihad, the aim of which is to bring the world under Islamic control. Ibn Taymiyah, a jurist and philosopher of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, described a world divided into two parts, Dar al-Harb, the territory of war, and Dar al-Islam, 155</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the already conquered territory of Islam.' In November 1914, the Ottoman Em- pire used Ibn Taymiyah's views on Jihad in a religious ruling in order to justify the war. Similarly, the Mufti and leader of Palestine during the 1930-1940s used Ji- had not just as an expression of religious intolerance, but also to justify political terrorism.2 Likewise, Sheikh Al-Rukabi of twentieth-century Damascus connects Jihad to national liberation movements. Both al-Husseini and al-Rukabi used the term Jihad to describe war against the "Zionist entity" in Palestine, making resis- tance against Israel therefore obligatory for Muslims everywhere. Their Syrian contemporary, Muhammad al-Bayuti, follows the four legal schools, emphasizing that the purpose of Islamic sovereignty is to turn the land to Dar al-Islam, whether its inhabitants are Muslims or not. Palestine under the control of Jews is Dar al- Kufr, the land of the infidel; therefore Muslims have an obligation to release it from the hands of its "occupiers."3 Sheikh Ekrima Sabri, the present Mufti of Jerusalem, said three years ago in an interview that Muslims embrace death while Israel is a selfish society that loves life, and they are not people who are eager to die for their country and their God. He added that Jews will leave this land rather than die, but the Muslim is happy to die.4 So it would seem that in Islam, unlike in Judaism, the issue of war and peace is almost monolithic, directed toward making the whole world Dar al-Islam. Main- stream Islam does not support coexistence with non-Muslim countries, although Islamic governments have historically tolerated foreign communities in their midst so long as their members behaved as subordinates, paying taxes in exchange for the opportunity to follow their religious laws, maintain communal autonomy, and enjoy property rights. Gopin's analysis of Israeli internal unity and search for ways to solve con- flicts is comprehensive. Certainly it is true that "creating a climate and a future vi- sion which is not violent ... can be done only by creating a nonviolent vision on both sides" (p. 209). This is difficult to accomplish, however, when Islamic reli- gious parties base their legitimacy on religious concepts such as Jihad, Dar al- Islam, and Dar al-Harb. Using religion as a main means of solving conflicts also poses the risk that leaders will interpret their sacred literature in ways that leave little room for com- promise.

See also western writers like Rudolph Peters, Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam (Princeton: Markus Wiener, 1996), who amplifies the different kinds of Jihad and emphasizes writers who think that putting an emphasis on the peace side of the Jihad can lead the Muslims to diverge from the main fight. Fregosi specifies the continuation of Jihad in Europe, Asia and Africa when it continues till today. The Muslims, he claims, "see in the Crusades a starting point of long military dispute between the west and the Islam, and Humeini says, 'The Jihad means the conquest of non-Muslims' territory, the domination of Koranic law from the end of the earth to the other'" (pp. 13-23). 4.

From the beginning they were debating whether to fight a religious war or to fight as a national liberation movement. We have chosen to act as a national liberation movement because it allows us to ac- complish compromise, but as soon as the issue of Jerusalem became religious we cannot leave al-Akza."5 Despite the reservations expressed here, Gopin's book and its suggestions and challenges illuminate significant initiatives and thoughts to be pursued in the near future.
