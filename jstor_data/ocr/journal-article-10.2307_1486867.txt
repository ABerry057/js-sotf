<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED by MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN Lawrence H. Schiffman. Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1994. xxvii, 529 pp. Lawrence Schiffman's new book on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the people of Qumran (which is now also available in paperback from the Anchor Bible Reference Library) is really several books in one, and its multiplicity of goals is simultaneously one of the book's virtues and flaws. It is at once a comprehensive synthetic presentation of the scrolls and the community which is presumed to have produced them, directed simultaneously at both a popular and an academic audience; a history of Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship; and an at times impassioned argument for the need to read the scrolls in the context of Jewish antiquity rather than as precursors to, antecedents of, or analogues of early Christianity. The wealth of photographs and the occasionally autobiographical tone, as well as the absence of footnotes and the somewhat oversized format, might well mislead some potential readers to think that this is just another popular book on the scrolls and not a scholarly treatment. But, in reality, Schiffman has produced a comprehensive popular treatment which should also be of interest to scholars of the scrolls and related fields. Once the a prioris and perspective of Schiffman's approach are discounted, we are left with the most important broad treatment of the scrolls in recent years, one that can be employed, with a few useful caveats, as a textbook in courses focused not only on the Dead Sea Scrolls, but more broadly on Judaism in antiquity. AJS Review 22/1 (1997): 77-93 77</page><page sequence="2">78 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN Other surveys of Qumran materials and issues have been published in recent years: new volumes by Edward M. Cook, Solving the Mysteries of the Dead Sea Scrolls: New Light on the Bible, and James C. VanderKam, The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, and a revised edition of Geza Vermes, The Dead Sea Scrolls: Qumran in Perspective. They are all introductory surveys, touching on the high points of Qumran scholarship, giving summaries of texts and issues, without having the latitude to dwell in much detail on any of them. Schiffman, on the contrary, tries to cover many aspects of the scrolls in some depth and to present more than a surface summary of a spectrum of issues pertaining to them. In this way, Schiffman's book represents a return to the approach employed in the earlier days of Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship, when there were far fewer texts to discuss and fewer years of scholarship to digest. I cannot think of any other book in English over the last twenty-five years that tries to present as comprehensive a picture of Qumran studies with as much detail. Because no Qumran scholar today, and Schiffman is no exception, can control with equal facility all aspects of this diverse material, certain aspects of the subject are treated with more authority than others, and the book's comprehensive sweep leaves room for some disagreement on particular aspects of the broad range of issues involved in Qumran scholarship. One of the factors that contributes to the perception that Schiffman's book is to be located in a popular, rather than a scholarly, arena is its lack of footnotes, which have been replaced by extensive reference notes, including bibliography, at the back of the book. Additionally, a crucial decision, which the author clearly made in order to keep the length of the book manageable, is likely to be uncomfortable for the scholar, although it may sit well with the lay reader, and that is the avoidance of discussion of scholarly opinion that differs from his own. There is little dialogue with opposing views or alternatives within the body of the text. Schiffman has chosen the option of a single, fairly integrated portrayal of the subject, rather than one that highlights the many scholarly disagreements that the study of all aspects of the scrolls has engendered. This occasionally gives the impression that the interpretation Schiffman is offering is the standard or undisputed one. In a book intended to have a popular appeal, such an approach is perhaps understandable, but it can be off-putting to scholars who are more aware of the range of learned opinions on many of the issues that Schiffman discusses. The reference notes, where the opinions that Schiffman rejects are mentioned, alleviate this difficulty, although not fully.</page><page sequence="3">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 79 Schiffman, one of the leading interpreters of Qumran legal texts, has created a stir in Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship in recent years by challenging the once generally accepted view of the Qumran group as Essenes, and claiming, primarily on the basis of halakhic texts such as 4QMiqsat Ma'ase ha-Torah (4QMMT),' that the group had "Sadducean" origins. It is true that virtually every group of which we know from Second Temple times has been identified as the source of the Dead Sea Scrolls over the last half-century, and Schiffman is not the first to claim Sadducean origins for the group. But there is a difference between earlier assertions that the sect was Sadducean and Schiffman's, a point overlooked in some of the earlier critical reviews of this volume. Schiffman's Sadducees, a hypothetical "pious" branch of the movement, are quite different from the Sadducees of H. H. Rowley, for example. This difference is due largely to Schiffman's definition of the Sadducees, not on the basis of theology or politics, but on the basis of legal practice. His emphasis on the legal material from Qumran reflects an attempt to locate the Qumranites within a Jewish context and presents a rather different perspective on the sect from the formerly regnant one, which was founded primarily on nonlegal, "theological" material, and was often associated with an attempt to study and analyze the texts as antecedent to, analogous to, or pertinent to early Christianity.2 1. Texts from the Judean desert (including, but not limited to, the Qumran scrolls) are identified by a siglum indicating location, in this case Cave 4 from Qumran, and title. E. Qimron and J. Strugnell (in consultation with Y. Sussmann and with contributions by Y. Sussmann and A. Yardeni), Qumran Cave 4, V: Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert 10 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1994) is the recently published text of this so-called "halakhic letter," the delay in whose publication caused a good deal of the stir which resulted in easier access for all scholars to the scrolls in the early 1990s. Surviving in six fragmentary copies from Cave 4, it contains a selection of halakhot wherein the author of MMT disagrees with unnamed opponents, and a section wherein the author exhorts his addressee to adopt his halakhic positions and join forces with him in opposing another, unnamed, group. Just who the author and the unnamed groups are is the subject of much debate among Qumranologists, as are many other unsettled issues regarding this fascinating text. For preliminary observations based on panel discussions at the 1994 annual meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature and the Association for Jewish Studies, see J. Kampen and M. J. Bernstein, eds., Reading 4QMMT: New Perspectives on Law and History at Qumran (Symposium 2; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996). 2. Schiffman exaggerates only a bit when he links the Essene identification of the group to the "Christianization of the Scrolls" (p. 17). The Essene theory does not imply that these are not Jewish documents, and they may very well furnish us with precursors of Jewish elements which Christianity inherited from common Second Temple Judaism or Essenism. The neglect by many scholars of work by Jewish scholars on the scrolls (p. 19) was probably as much an</page><page sequence="4">80 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN It is clear that one of Schiffman's goals is to provide a systematic presentation of a Jewish context for the Dead Sea sect (and whether we call them Essenes or pious Sadducees is not really the critical issue for him). The titles of the first subchapter in part II, which begins the real discussion of the scrolls community, "Judaism, Hellenism, and Sectarianism," and of the final subchapter of the book, "The Decline of Sectarianism and the Emergence of Rabbinic Judaism," highlight this intention. The starting point informing much of Schiffman's analysis is that much of what is found at Qumran is representative of Second Temple Judaism as a whole, and not typical of one isolated group alone. Therefore, in his location of the Qumran sect within the environs of Second Temple Judaism, Schiffman makes much greater use of rabbinic material, particularly legal texts, than did most other analyses in the past. This contextual approach is no longer uncommon in the more recent surveys of the scrolls, which, even if less comprehensive than Schiffman's, acknowledge the significance of the complex Judaism of the Second Temple for our understanding of these texts, but it is more crucial to Schiffman's analysis. He follows up the Zadokite/Sadducee identification of the sect with a thorough reading of the scrolls as texts of Jewish history, and this is the driving force behind the book. Despite the presence of the words "the background of Christianity" in the title, virtually all aspects of Schiffman's treatment deal with the scrolls as they relate to the history of Judaism. The larger divisions that make up the book are, on the whole, what we should expect, but there are some surprises. The opening two chapters, "Shepherds and Scholars" and "Scholars, Scrolls and Scandals," copiously decorated with photographs of many scrolls researchers, past and present, show how the history of Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship per se has become a topic of interest. For the nonspecialist reader, this historical review may titillate by revealing the occasionally seamy side of academic scholarship, but the scholar of Qumran will realize that it serves Schiffman's agenda by explaining the difficulty in the Jewish contextualization of the scrolls. The history of scrolls scholarship has a role to play for him in the justification of what he calls, with some exaggeration, the "revolutionary" claim "that the scrolls can be understood only in the context of Jewish history" (p. xxiv). It is certainly true that the halakhic material in the scrolls, even those discovered in the 1950s, was little studied by non-Jewish researchers, who were neither avoidance of Israeli scholarship written in modem Hebrew as of Jewish scholarship. As we all know, that is not a problem limited to the scholarship on the Dead Sea Scrolls.</page><page sequence="5">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 81 competent to study it nor interested in its ramifications for the history of Judaism in the Second Temple period. Texts like 11QTemple, obtained by Yigael Yadin in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of June 1967, and 4QMMT could only be read and interpreted by scholars trained in the analysis of Jewish law, and such interpreters were few and far between in the camp of the original Qumran experts. It was the work of scholars like Yadin, Joseph M. Baumgarten, and Schiffman himself that placed Qumran halakhah front and center as one of the major areas of Qumran research and perforce opened up research in the scrolls to classically trained Jewish scholars. Schiffman's summary of the archaeology of Qumran is derivative, but balanced. In the absence of official excavation reports, which are only now being published, many theories on the nature of the Qumran settlement have been proposed without sound evidence. Schiffman points out the difficulties of some of the more outlandish, arguing from what we do know about the archaeology of the site. Since what we know or want to know about the settlement can be separated a good deal of the time from what we know about the texts in the scrolls, research on the documents continues while we await the long-delayed revelation of the excavation results. Because the book attempts to create an all-encompassing picture, there is at times a need to fill in gaps with data that are not fully proven. Reliance on debatable hypothetical reconstructions can be a bit misleading to the lay reader and disconcerting to the scholar. Schiffman at times writes with what appears to be certainty about matters that are debatable or unprovable. History is far more difficult to reconstruct than practices and beliefs, especially when detailed argumentation and evidence are omitted, and Schiffman's introductory background chapter, "Judaism, Hellenism and Sectarianism," is a good illustration of the problem. The summary of the confrontation between Hellenism and Judaism is brief and perhaps oversimplified. There may be justification for such abbreviation in light of the book's primary focus, but should one write that "The earliest attempts at organized rebellion were probably led by the Hasidim, a group of pietists who found the religious compromises in Hellenistic Jerusalem totally unacceptable" (p. 70)? Can we be certain that the Hasidim were already "capitalized"? Likewise, the assertion that in the Hasmonean period "we first meet . . . the three major sects of the period-Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. The group that collected the Dead Sea Scrolls also arose at that time" (p. 72) is too strong (implying that there clearly were four distinct denominations) and could be misleading to a</page><page sequence="6">82 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN reader unaware of the hazard of such labeling of the diverse groups in the Maccabean period, whether according to Schiffman's theory or any other. Finally, one of the cornerstones of Schiffman's historico-religious recon- struction, the secession of a pious group of Sadducean priests from Jerusalem to Qumran to establish what became the Qumran sect, is one of those very debatable issues expressed virtually as fact as if it were more widely accepted. Schiffman's reconstruction of the early history of the group based on 4QMMT and CD3 is possible, but is far from being the only option available. Schiffman reads 4QMMT as the "foundation document" of the sect, but drawing firm conclusions from it is hazardous in light of the fact that the identification of the various groups implied in 4QMMT. is still very much a subject of contention among students of this recently published text.4 Although I tend to agree with Schiffman's identification of the Qumran group as related to the Sadducees on the basis of their legal system, there are still some very large questions about the interface of theology and halakhah that must be answered before a reconstruction like Schiffman's can be endorsed without reservation. Schiffman's work does not merely summarize the documents from the caves of Qumran, but uses them smoothly in a synthesis of the history, beliefs, and practices of their authors. In attempting to depict the organization of the sect, Schiffman draws on both CD and 1QS,5 of course, and then proceeds to compare the results with Josephus' description of the Essenes and with the Pharisaic havurah described by the rabbis. In particular, he employs the 3. This work, variously known as the "Damascus Document," "Damascus Covenant," "Zadokite Document," and "Zadokite Fragment," was first published in 1910 from two fragmentary copies discovered by Solomon Schechter in the Cairo Geniza under the title Fragments of a Zadokite Work. Its centrality to the Qumran community was revealed with the discovery of some ten fragmentary copies, representing a more complete text than the medieval ones, in the caves at Qumran. 4. Cf. the discussions in Qimron and Strugnell's edition and in Kampen and Bernstein, Reading 4QMMT. The reader should also be aware that 4QMMT, despite its surviving in fragments from six manuscripts, is still very fragmentary and its restoration debated. Schiffman's quotation on p. 85, "they will repent in Isra[el] for[ever]" should almost certainly be read "they shall return in Isra[el] to the T[orah]" (reconstructing lat[orah] rather than lat[amid]). 5. Serekh Hayahad, usually referred to as the "Community Rule" or the "Manual of Discipline," is one of the "complete" scrolls discovered initially in Cave 1 in 1947. It contains both theologically instructive material as well as regulations for conduct within a sectarian framework. Several copies of the work, which demonstrate its complex literary development, have been found in Cave 4.</page><page sequence="7">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 83 details of the laws in CD to extrapolate the social structure of the sect, on the reasonable grounds that those laws are more likely to reflect a reality than some other Qumran legal texts. He plausibly concludes that the observed commonality of practice is further evidence for shared mores among groups in Second Temple Judaism. But at times Schiffman's analogies from the context of Second Temple Judaism are not convincing. The example of the Pharisees becoming talmudic rabbis is not a satisfactory model for the move from priestly to lay leadership, as claimed for the sect (p. 113). And, although Schiffman lays out the textual evidence for the various leadership positions of the group quite well, I am not certain that "the maskil closely resembles the lay Pharisaic sages who eventually became the teachers of the Mishnah. The maskilim, like the earlier Pharisaic lay sages, were experts in the law and its interpretation and, in some cases, involved themselves in its dissemination" (p. 126). Schiffman strains to show the similarities between Qumran and rabbinic leadership structures, but the effort is one of his less successful and the results rather tenuous. By its very presence, Schiffman's chapter "Women in the Scrolls" moves away from some of the earlier depictions of the sect as virtually womanless.6 Schiffman's examination of a fairly broad range of material in the scrolls about women and marriage shows how wrongheaded were the early attempts to make the Qumran group into a monastic, celibate community. On the other hand, Schiffman relies too heavily in his discussion of "Faith and Belief' on the Thanksgiving Hymns (Hodayot) as interpreted by H. Ringgren's 1963 book The Faith ofQumran: The Theology of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In this area, a new synthesis, such as his treatment of th'. subject of women at Qumran, would have been very welcome, especially if it had utilized texts published more recently than the Hodayot. In his brief summary at the end of this section, Schiffman attempts to resolve the contradictions between Josephus' account of the Sadducees and the beliefs of the Qumran group, which, in his view, were also "Sadducee." His position, that the Hellenized Sadducees and the Qumran group ("perhaps included in the term 'Essenes"' [p. 157]) 6. Schiffman's material should now be supplemented by Eileen Schuller's important article "Women in the Dead Sea Scrolls," in Methods ofInvestigation of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Khirbet Qumran Site: Present Realities and Future Prospects, ed. M. O. Wise et al. (New York: New York Academy of Science, 1994), pp. 115-131, which appeared too late for its results to be included. Also to be added to the bibliography of this section is S. J. D. Cohen, "The Beauty of Flora and the Beauty of Sarai," Helios 8 (1981): 41-53, a comparison of the description of Sarai's beauty in 1QapGen with a Hellenistic analogue.</page><page sequence="8">84 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN developed theologically in different directions after they separated, may need refining, but indicates that his view of the Qumran group as Sadducean has become more nuanced in response to much of the obvious criticism to which it was subjected when first promulgated. The sequence of the chapters, which moves from matters of theology to the topic of the Bible at Qumran, is not obvious at first glance, although it serves to highlight the broad importance that biblical material of all sorts had for Second Temple Judaism. Schiffman's discussion of the distribution of biblical manuscripts at Qumran and the question of canon is clear, adopting a fairly conservative view of rabbinic canonical activity.in the first century C.E. The evidence points to a body of authoritative literature containing Torah, Prophets, and other material now included in the Hagiographa. But it should be noted that the "allusion to the tripartite canon" (p. 166) is based on a plausible, but not definite, reconstruction of three juxtaposed fragments from 4QMMT, beyond which there is no evidence, in my view, of a tripartite canon at Qumran. Regardless of the nature of the "canon," it is also possible, as Schiffman suggests, that works like the Aramaic Levi Document and Jubilees might have been "canonical" at Qumran, based on citations of them in other Qumran texts. Schiffman's view on the nature of the biblical text at Qumran differs from the regnant position, which sees much greater variety than his does, and needs to be modified in terms of statistics, taking into consideration Emanuel Tov's recalculations which reduce the percentage of "Proto-masoretic" material in the scrolls. Since Schiffinan admits that he holds a minority view, the reference notes to this section should have been more explicit on the views of others whose theories he rejects. On the other hand, the presentation of the evidence for the divergence of some of the biblical scrolls from the Masoretic text is quite forthright. One of the striking passages wherein 4QSama differs from MT is adduced in detail (although I should have liked a couple of more examples as well), and the data regarding Jeremiah, the paleo-Exodus scroll, and 11QPsa are presented with textual examples where pertinent. In the final analysis, however, the issue of whether or not the Masoretic type was "dominant" in the Dead Sea Scrolls may not be as important as the evidence of a process of standardization of which we had no inkling before the Qumran discoveries. Schiffman has long asserted that the literature found in the Qumran caves represents Second Temple Judaism and not only the Qumran sect. Although terms like "canonical" and "apocryphal" beg the question somewhat, they</page><page sequence="9">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 85 are convenient ways of referring to works that are or are not part of the Masoretic Hebrew Bible, a convenient touchstone or point of reference. Schiffman devotes much more space to the nonbiblical texts than to the biblical, a position easily vindicated by the greater familiarity readers have with the latter. He gives the most space to Enoch, Jubilees, and Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus) as texts which appear at Qumran, although he does not deal with the date of Enoch, and his date for Jubilees (pre-168 B.C.E.) is a bit early according to most scholars. I note in passing that the so-called "Pseudo-Jubilees" texts may not be as closely related to Jubilees as Schiffman suggests, although he bases his remarks on the work of VanderKam, who recently published them. In my view, there is still much work to be done on the generic classification and filiation of many of the biblically oriented works from Qumran, and premature associations via nomenclature are to be avoided if possible. In the context of Ben Sira, Schiffman draws our attention to the newly released wisdom literature from Qumran, texts referred to as "Sapiential Works" and "Book of Mysteries." These are valuable additions to the tradition of wisdom literature, which began in the ancient Near East and runs through Proverbs and Ecclesiastes to rabbinic works like Pirqei Avot. Schiffman stresses how these new texts have much in common with the already known wisdom tradition, but also differ from it significantly. Since these texts have not yet been integrated into studies of Qumran theology, Schiffman's efforts in that direction are particularly welcome. He also briefly discusses Tobit and the Testaments of Levi, Naphtali, and Kohath. His characterizations of these works will be valuable for students of the scrolls who have not yet found their way to the study of the apocryphal and pseudepigraphical literature of the Second Temple period. From works that supplement or complement the Bible, Schiffman moves to works that interpret it, presenting two chapters on different modes of biblical interpretation, from translation and commentary to retelling to harmonizing and legal exegesis, on the one hand, and to the unique form of prophetic interpretation called pesher, on the other.7 His point, and I believe that it is quite well taken, is that scriptural interpretation as reflected in the Qumran scrolls is a mirror for what was going on in Second Temple Judaism more 7. Add to the bibliography and the reference notes on Aramaic targum the valuable Ph.D. thesis by Bruce E. Zuckerman, "The Process of Translation in 11QtgJob: A Preliminary Study" (Yale University, 1980).</page><page sequence="10">86 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN broadly. A survey of the interpretive documents found in the caves shows how broad was the spectrum of types and genres available to the student of Scripture in this period. Both for narrative and legal pentateuchal texts, Schiffman shows the array of exegetical methods ready for the Qumranic interpreter. I believe, however, that he goes too far when he claims that "this form of interpretation [in the sectarian legal corpus] together with harmonizing interpretation typifies the Sadducean trend of biblical exposition alluded to in rabbinic sources" (p. 222). This assertion demands more evidence; the rabbinic sources are far from explicit, and Schiffman would certainly agree that we are still working with insufficient data in this area, and Jhat even the exegetical methodology of the Dead Sea Scrolls legal texts which we do have requires further study. Unsurprisingly, Schiffman's discussion of law and related issues (Pt. IV) is probably the strongest section of the book. It is here that the difference between Schiffman's approach and that of most other scrolls scholars is best highlighted, since it is, of course, from legal material that he has derived his reidentification of the group as Sadducean. He stresses, quite correctly, that the significant corpus of legal material from Qumran teaches us, not only about the law as observed in that community, but about varying attitudes to and practices of the law in the Second Temple period as a whole. He maintains his long-held, although debatable, position that "the legal materials of the sect are to a great extent derived from biblical interpretation, an activity that took place at regular study sessions as part of sectarian life, most probably at the main center at Qumran. The decisions reached at such sessions were recorded in lists of sectarian laws called serakhim" (p. 247). In the interest of locating Qumran halakhah within a context, and of contrasting it with its rabbinic counterpart, Schiffman gathers what he believes to be allusions to the Pharisees in the scrolls, and stresses that many of them focus on a critique of the theory of Pharisaic halakhah. The material in 4QMMT and the Temple Scroll (11QT) for the first time furnish halakhic views that are of a near-Sadducean nature and give us a means of access to the outlook of the Sadducees that has not been filtered through Josephus or the rabbis. The longest of the Qumran scrolls, 11QT, merits an entire chapter, although, like a number of other scholars, Schiffman believes that it may very well be pre-Qumranic in origin, and that the ideas reflected in it are not yet those fully developed by the Qumran sect. Schiffmnan, drawing on the many studies which he has published on specific aspects of this text, presents his views on its relationship to other Qumran material, an outline</page><page sequence="11">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 87 (but not a detailed summary) of its contents, and important remarks on the theology of this utopian, although not messianic, legal document. In addition to characterizing the harmonistic exegesis which characterizes the Temple Scroll, he highlights several specific groups of laws, such as those pertaining to the centrality of the Temple in the ideal Land of Israel, and the law of the king, an assortment of nonbiblical regulations for the king and his army, which imply a critique of the Hasmonean rulers. Schiffman compares the critique of Pharisaic law and Hasmonean policy in this text with the analogous polemic in 4QMMT, concluding that they imply that "Pharisaic rulings were being followed in the Temple in the early Hasmonean period" (p. 271). The importance of this point is not limited to Qumran studies, but has ramifications for Second Temple and rabbinic history and historiography. The development of the law of the sect, according to Schiffman, proceeded from those two documents to other halakhic works whose legal views do not remain purely Sadducean, although they clearly maintain Sadducean qualities in both content and method. A work like the Zadokite Document contains both legal material and a history and theology of the group. It is quite possible, as Schiffman tentatively suggests, that the laws in such a text might have been accepted not only by the inhabitants of Qumran, but by other Jews who maintained Sadducean, priestly, halakhic traditions. He proceeds to list the other Qumran texts that contain halakhic material, concentrating his analysis on two areas on which he has written in the past, Sabbath law and civil law. His treatment of the former contrasts the Qumran rulings on a number of specific issues with the Sabbath law as it is reflected in rabbinic literature and in the New Testament. Likewise, in reviewing the details of certain aspects of civil law, Schiffman is able to stress both the centrality of law in the various manifestations of Judaism in the Second Temple and the ways in which the laws of the Qumran sect differed from those of other Jews in source and in practice. In discussing "Prayer and Ritual" Schiffman makes the important point that the Qumran library enables us to see the movement toward prayer as a form of divine service that reaches its culmination with rabbinic Judaism after the destruction of the Temple. One of the best-represented literary genres at Qumran is prayer, and we find a variety of subcategories in the hundreds of nonbiblical psalms, poems, and prayers in varying degrees of preservation. Schiffman quotes freely from a variety of prayer texts that are often among the less well known documents from the caves. It is clear that communication with the divine was a major concern of the Qumranites. Not only did they</page><page sequence="12">88 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN face the same "Temple-less" Judaism that the rabbis later did, but we find in their liturgies a variety of texts which remind us, to say the least, of certain rabbinic prayers. This similarity in prayer patterns stands in sharp contrast to matters of the calendar, in which, as is well known, the Qumran sectarians differed from the rabbis. Schiffman makes the interesting observation that 4QMMT, which challenges the halakhic practices of the opponents of its author, does not contain any polemic about calendrical changes; this indicates, he concludes, that it is the Pharisaic lunar calendar which was ancient and traditional, while the priestly solar one was innovative.8 If his inference is correct, much of our understanding of Jewish calendrical activity in antiqtiity will have to be revised. The archaeological remains of tefillin and mezuzot indicate that the Qumran group did not have a uniform practice regarding these religious obligations, with some of the surviving material conforming to what later became rabbinic standards, while other remains do not. Because the Qumran discoveries furnished data on Jewish messianism in the period prior to the rise of Christianity, messianism in the scrolls has been one of the prominent areas in Dead Sea Scrolls research from the beginning. Schiffman's discussion of messianic and eschatological issues is fairly clear, as, following the by-now standard paradigm established by Gershom Scholem, he characterizes messianic trends in Second Temple literature as restorative and utopian. Furnishing a brief sketch of messianic trends in this era, he notes the connection between the utopian view and dualism, the view that there is an ongoing struggle between good and evil in the world that will only be resolved at the end of time. This feature, of course, is of great import when evaluating the Qumran views of messianism. One of the true truisms of Dead Sea Scrolls research is that the Qumran sect "placed great emphasis on eschatology" (p. 321). A broad variety of texts from the caves, both familiar and recently published, focus on what will happen in the end of days and who will lead the community of the elect at that time. The range of evidence, which need not have come from one source or one time, creates a tension in the Qumran material between a one-messiah paradigm and a two-messiah pattern.' Schiffman is careful 8. The presence of a "sectarian" calendar at the beginning of one of the manuscripts of 4QMMT is explained by Schiffman, quite plausibly, as the addendum of a copyist who, knowing the significance of the calendar in the sect's disputes with its opponents, added it to the original "letter." 9. See, most recently, Dead Sea Discoveries 2, no. 2 (June 1995), an issue devoted</page><page sequence="13">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 89 not to try to assimilate all these texts to one another, referring instead to "two competing messianic ideas: the notion of a single, Davidic messiah and notion of two complementary messiahs-the Aaronide, priestly leader and the lay messiah of Israel" (p. 326). Schiffman points out correctly that it is not even clear whether the nonpriestly messiah in the two-messiah portrait is always Davidic. What is clear is that the presence of these conflicting trends-restorative and utopian/apocalyptic, Davidic and dual-side by side at Qumran should affect our analysis of the messianism of other groups in late antiquity, including rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity. But there is more to the end of time than messianism, and the views in the scrolls of how the community would operate in the eschatological era, the wars which it would wage, and the ensuing eschatological meal are summarized by Schiffman. He argues quite plausibly that the communal meal of the Qumran sect is a foreshadowing of the eschatological banquet and is not to be viewed as "sacral"; this, of course, undermines the position of those who drew analogies between it and the early Christian eucharist. Neither the participation of priests nor the requirement of ritual purity is "sacral" for Schiffman, nor is the recitation of blessings upon partaking of food. All are characteristic, to greater or lesser degrees, of Second Temple "common" Judaism, which demonstrated the respect of the community for the priesthood, attempted to maintain the laws of ritual purity, and perhaps recited benedictions before and after eating. The reflection of the eschatological meal in ordinary communal meals, suggests Schiffinan, is part of the way in which the sect linked its present and its future. There are texts from Qumran whose importance, especially in the public eye, is disproportional to their size. Two of them are discussed by Schiffman in the context of messianism and eschatology: the "son of God text" and the "pierced messiah text." The first is a genuinely complex document, as it is not clear whether the term refers to a messianic (positive) or arrogant and boastful (negative) figure. If the former, then the Christian employment of this term in the first century C.E. may have derived from its usage in a group like that from which this text derives. But as is frequently the case with the Qumran manuscripts, the disputed interpretation of the first portion generates completely to "Messianism," especially Martin G. Abegg, "The Messiah at Qumran: Are We Still Seeing Double?" pp. 125-144. For a broader perspective, cf. J. J. Collins, The Scepter and the Star: The Messiahs of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Ancient Literature (New York: Doubleday, 1995).</page><page sequence="14">90 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN confusion in the reading of later portions. Schiffman accepts the messianic interpretation of the "son of God" because the description of the End of Days in the latter section of the document coheres best with such an interpretation. But he insists correctly that, despite our initial surprise, the term "son of God" does not preclude the text's fitting in well with Jewish doctrines of the Second Temple period. The "pierced messiah" text, on the other hand, owes its significance in the public arena to claims made in the popular press that it contains references to an executed, even crucified, messiah. But the document is part of a text belonging to the same. family as the War Scroll. With its other fragments describing the eschatological battle in terms familiar from other Qumran texts, the key phrase in the so-called messianic fragment must be understood to read "the Prince of the Congregation shall kill him" rather than "they shall kill the Prince of the Congregation." It took a series of tendentious misreadings of the Hebrew to turn a passage about the eschatological victory of the sect over (perhaps) the Romans into the description of something that would, once again, serve as analogue to early Christianity.'0 These examples should serve to indicate that although the "Christianization" of the scrolls, the indiscriminate and undisciplined exploitation of the scrolls to "foreshadow" early Christianity, has been abandoned by the academic mainstream, it can still be found on the periphery. More responsible scholars, Christian and Jewish alike, have stressed the elements in early Christianity which find their roots in the Judaism of the Second Temple period, and, in particular, the rich contribution which the ongoing publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls has made to our understanding of these elements. Since Schiffman's goal is to be as comprehensive as possible in his treatment of the scrolls material, he includes treatments of less-discussed aspects of Qumran, such as mysticism and magic. In this area as well, the Qumran documents furnish an early Jewish source for the development of these themes in later Judaism. Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch describe God's throne, and the "Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice" furnish an angelic liturgy. For Schiffman, this is "a speculative description of what goes on in heaven" 10. Likewise, the "Messianic Apocalypse" (4Q521), which has an unmistakable reference to resurrection, has been "Christianized" by the probably mistaken suggestion that it is the messiah, and not God, who will resurrect the dead. Although Schiffman's tone occasionally becomes strident in disputing such readings, his argument is correct on its merits, that such messianic texts are best read in the context of ancient Judaism and as "the background to Christianity" of his title. Cf. his remarks on p. 404.</page><page sequence="15">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 91 (p. 358), not yet the experiential mysticism of later Jewish traditions, and although a direct line need not lead from Qumran through the Hekhalot literature of the early Middle Ages, the Qumran data fill in a formerly lacking piece of the puzzle. In this section, as in many others, Schiffman furnishes sizable blocks of material from the scrolls in English translation, so that the reader can get a sense of the primary texts on which his discussion is based. His brief discussion of texts dealing with magic is a good example of the synthesis of scholarship together with an appeal to popular interest that heightens the awareness of the lay reader about this somewhat mysterious topic. The last unit of Schiffman's volume is also generated by his insistence on locating the scrolls in a more Jewish matrix. The chapters on "Israel and the Nations" and "Jerusalem the Holy City" are not typical of the rubrics under which the Qumran scrolls were discussed in the past. In discussing the relationship of Jews and non-Jews in the scrolls, Schiffman stresses once again (and probably overemphasizes by this point in his discussion) that nothing in the scrolls refers specifically to Christianity. But what is important is the nature of the references to non-Jews. In addition to laws derived from Scripture, we find laws against stealing from non-Jews (because it reflects badly on the Jewish people), explicit regulations regarding commerce with Gentiles, in particular selling them animals, produce, and slaves, and the prohibition of the employment of non-Jews to do work forbidden to Jews on the Sabbath. The treatment of non-Jews in the legal texts from Qumran is analogous to, although often stricter than, their treatment in later rabbinic literature. Several significant sections of the Temple Scroll that are not directly grounded in Scripture focus on the interface between Jews and non-Jews, and Schiffman suggests that in the Hasmonean period, issues of Jewish-Gentile interaction may have been of particular significance. The greater exclusivity of the Qumranites vis-a-vis the rabbis can be seen in the limited access which proselytes have to the rituals of the sect. Extrahalakhically, too, the scrolls maintain a stance quite in consonance with other documents of Jewish antiquity. They refer to the nations of the world primarily as opponents to be utterly vanquished in the eschatological battles that would take place at the end of time, and the chosenness of Israel is stressed in terms that are familiar from the Bible, on one side, and from rabbinic literature and liturgy on the other. Schiffman uses the chapter on Jerusalem as a vehicle to draw together a potpourri of texts that allude, in diverse ways, to the holy city, ranging</page><page sequence="16">92 MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN from the pesharim to the Halakhic Letter to the Psalms Scroll. The sect held an ambivalent relationship to Jerusalem, which they longed, to see attain its ideal state, but the governance of which they abhorred. The future Jerusalem is described in a variety of works, generally employing language and motifs borrowed from the Bible, with the most striking passage probably being the so-called "Apostrophe to Zion," an acrostic poem yearning for the redemption of the city and the fulfillment of the prophetic dreams about it. A very fragmentary Aramaic text, whose significance may be inferred from the fact that at least five copies of it survive, describes the ideal plan of the "New Jerusalem," a title borrowed by its editors from the Book of Revelation. The description of the city in rather minute detail indicates the importance which Jerusalem played in the aspirations of Second Temple Judaism, including the Qumran sect. Finally, by concluding the volume with "The Decline of Sectarianism and the Emergence of Rabbinic Judaism," Schiffman closes the circle where he began. He started by asserting that the scrolls must be read first and foremost as the product of Second Temple Judaism, and he ends by linking the end of the Dead Sea sect, and concomitantly Second Temple sectarianism in general, with the survival of Judaism in its rabbinic form. By examining briefly other documents often associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Copper Scroll found in Cave 3, as well as the texts from Masada and those from the Judaean Desert in the Bar Kokhba period, he argues that a consensus was gradually emerging at the time of the two great revolts against Rome that culminated in the appearance of rabbinic Judaism as the focal point of Jewish activity by the mid-second century C.E. But Masada preserves Ben Sira and the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice side by side with biblical texts of a much more pronounced Masoretic nature than the scrolls from Qumran, and it is tempting to believe that we can observe here the beginning of the traditions which preserved some of these works into the Jewish Middle Ages despite rabbinic opposition to the apocryphal and apocalyptic literature of the Second Temple. Schiffman is correct in asserting that one of the factors that "encouraged the shift from sectarianism to Jewish consensus in the first century C.E. was the rise of Christianity" (p. 404). It is quite possible that the absorption and integration of certain sectarian Jewish ideals into early Christianity virtually guaranteed that they would not find a place in the Judaism which survived this period; and in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the split between Judaism and the new religion became unbridgeable. Schiffman sketches very briefly the ways in which he believes that the Bar Kokhba documents</page><page sequence="17">THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS RECLAIMED 93 point toward the nascence of rabbinic Judaism, stressing the well-known phenomenon that with the destruction of the Temple and the Bar Kokhba revolt Jewish sectarianism seems to come to an end, to be replaced by the conflict between the Synagogue and the Church. The length of this review essay is due both to the richness of Schiffman's book, the topics of which have not been exhausted in this survey, and to its importance as having established a clear and coherent stance for the interpretation of the scrolls in the context of Jewish history and thought. There is no doubt that any reviewer will find one or another chapter of the book deficient from some specific perspective; this will always be the case when a broad synthesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls is written by virtually any scholar, for no one is equally competent in all the complex fields of Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship. What Schiffman has done is to contextualize these texts for interpretation, and that is more important than his particular interpretation of any specific issue. Any further broad discussion of the scrolls is going to have to deal with the matrix in which he has located them, and to reject that matrix in favor of another if Schiffman's is found wanting. Even scholars who disagree with Schiffman's broad synthesis will be able to employ it as a touchstone for debate. And the layperson who approaches the volume with the caveats which I have suggested in mind will come away with a deeper understanding of the scrolls, the sect which produced them, as well as Second Temple Judaism in general.
