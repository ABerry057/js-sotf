Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006. xx, 316 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001086 This book opens with the following observation: "Works of history are sup posed to be dispassionate, their authors detached, and the books they write judg mentally neutral. By these standards, this book is a failure. Engagement and emotion are visible on every page." Indeed, engagement and emotion are in evi dence throughout the book, the product of Kenneth Stow's long career of writing about the troubled history between Christians and Jews. A sense of frustration with the resilience of Christian antisemitism (my use of this term is intentional, as Stow dismisses any distinction between anti-Judaism and antisemitism, pp. 204-5) permeates the work. But if Stow's long engagement with the history of Chris tian-Jewish relations seems to foster a tone of exasperation, so, too, does it provide a wonderful vantage point for exploration. Stow moves back and forth across 2,000 years of Christian history to outline what he sees as a continuity of mentality underlying Western Christian (then Catholic) responses to Jews and Judaism, the persistence of which exposes a deep gulf between Christian self-understanding and Christianity's true nature. The recurring depiction of Jews as dogs from antiquity to the twentieth century testifies to a central Christian concern with bodily purity and pollution, Stow asserts, a concern that underlies the development and persistence of the blood libel and that, in tandem with Pauline supersessionism, shapes the nature of Catholic-Jewish relations to the present day. The book is arranged in reverse chronological order: Stow deals with the nineteenth and twentieth centuries first, then the seventeenth century, then turns to the medieval French context, around which the project is built, and finally moves forward once again into the present. Chapter 1 lays out the argument for continuity across this vast period. In a fascinating discussion o?fin de si?cle Catho lic modernism and conservative responses, Stow argues that the acceptance or rejection of medieval ritual murder accusations and the blood libel played a pivotal role in the rhetoric between Catholic modernizers and their conservative opponents within the church, as antimodernists became vigorous defenders of ritual murder charges. In Chapter 2, Stow looks back to the seventeenth-century Bollandists' hagio graphical project and the place of host desecration accusations, ritual murder accusa tions, and the blood libel in their efforts to preserve Catholic sacramental doctrine and soteriology against the challenge of Protestantism. Chapter 3 continues to explore the motivations and sensibilities of the Bollandists at their work, comparing the twelfth-century chronicle versions of the 1179 Richard of Pontoise incident with the Bollandists' reconstruction to highlight what Stow calls their "editorial con sciousness" (77). The Bollandists linked Richard's story with other purported acts of ritual murder and Jewish perfidy and painted Philip Augustus's Jewish policies as retribution for those acts. Stow argues that the Bollandists "intuitively" under stood the extent to which "charges of ritual murder did guide the twelfth-century mind with respect to Jews, especially that of royalty" (84). 188</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews This argument sets up the next chapter, in which Stow uses the Bollandist understanding of the relationship between belief in ritual murder and Philip Augustus's Jewish policies to radically reinterpret the Hebrew documents com monly known as the "Blois letters." Stow argues that the long-held association of the letters, extant only in a mid-fifteenth-century manuscript, with the 1171 Blois incident is mistaken. He suggests a later date for the letters?sometime after the alleged ritual murder of Richard of Pontoise and the expulsion of 1182? and argues that they ought to be read as an ironic condemnation of the anti-Jewish policies of King Philip Augustus rather than as praise for Philip's father, Louis VII: "However much...the letters appear to be enhancing and sweetening the royal image, readers were assumed to be more astute. By way of a description that used irony to invert reality, readers were to understand that the king intended was Philip" (111). Anticipating criticism, Stow attempts to head off detractors with a lengthy footnote (257-60) in which he dismisses potential objections as emotionally driven and explains what he sees at stake: "The point of all this...is not arcane scholarly polemic. It is the fundamental one of methodology in reading medieval Hebrew narrative texts, which clearly cannot be read solely from within." His plea for a more sophisticated reading of medieval Hebrew texts, read in the context of contemporary Latin and vernacular works, is a point well taken, and one taken up with great effect in recent years by the likes of Israel Yuval, Susan Einbinder, Ivan Marcus, Jeremy Cohen, and Eva Haverkamp, among others. The revision is criti cal for Stow: The reinterpretation of these texts supports the notion that Philip Augustus's Jewish policies were shaped by firm belief in ritual murder and the blood libel, itself evidence that Christian anti-Jewish policies were dictated by concern for the purity of the Christian Eucharistie community. The later chapters of the book return to the question of purity and pollution, looking first at the function of ritual murder accusations and the blood libel in the work of first-generation Bollandists and their successors, then using the image of the Jewish dog to explain the ritual murder myth in terms of competing systems of purity and pollution. Stow makes the argument that "despite teachings to the con trary, which go back to the time of Christian origins, the competition between Jews and Christians is not, nor has it ever truly been, one between exponents of Paul's 'spiritual' Christianity confronting a 'carnal Israel.' Rather, it has been a compe tition between two mutually exclusive systems, both devoted to bodily purity and pollution's avoidance" (133). Charging that the Christian fear of bodily impurity imparted by Jews "should not have been present in a noumenal system that pro claims the defeat of carnality and the triumph of spirit" (144), Stow attributes this disjunction to Paul, the source of Christian identity as spiritual Israel, as well as the source of concern with communal and bodily purity. The final chapter addresses the question of Christian supersessionism in light of this purity/pollution framework, looking at a range of Catholic perspec tives and policies from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century. Stow's book ends on a fairly pessimistic note, suggesting that contemporary Catholic identity still depends on the same framing of Jewish alterity that gave rise to the blood libel, an understanding of Judaism as undermining the integrity of the Christian 189</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews body. In the penultimate paragraph, Stow writes, "Perhaps one day the tide of these attractions will ebb. One must hope that 'this too will pass.' Yet the weight of so long and complex a historical past says that this will not happen easily, certainly not on its own. The vision of protecting the children and their bread has been too central... What I hope to have accomplished here is to show how great the force of that 'historical weight' is, as well as the implications of its real nature" (173). There is certainly room for complaint here: Stow's argument is uncomfortably circular when he insists that the interpretation of the Bollandists provides the key to understanding the medieval ritual murder charge itself, as his interpretation of the medieval context depends on an acceptance of the notion of continuity of mentality. The assumption of continuity also allows Stow to build interpretations for specific periods utilizing decontexrualized evidence drawn from widely disparate moments. Though the tenacity of the image of the Jewish dog is striking in Stow's hands, it is far from clear that this is the central image of Jews/Judaism in Christian tradition or that it always carries the precise meaning that he assigns to it. Still, in spite of what may be some interpretive overreach, Stow presents an important reassessment of Christian-Jewish relations broadly writ and, in doing so, provides one of the most compelling contributions to date on the development and persistence of the blood libel, the importance of which has recently been made abundantly clear in the disturbing appearance of Ariel Toaff's Pasque di Sangue.
