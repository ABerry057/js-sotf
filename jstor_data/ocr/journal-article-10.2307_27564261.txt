How could it be otherwise? Diplomat, playwright, journalist, politician, and visionary, Mordecai Manuel Noah (1785-1851) was an extraordinary individual. In the course of his life, he wrote and produced suc cessful plays, fought a duel, established himself as a popular newspaper columnist, rescued enslaved American sailors during his tenure as U.S. consul in Tunis, pub lished an important book on his travels in Europe and North Africa, influenced presidential elections through his editorship of major newspapers, and served as judge and port surveyor of New York City. He was easily the most prominent and influential Jew in the United States during the first half of the nineteenth century. Moreover, he has been described as the first public figure "to demand con tinuous recognition as both a devoted American and as a devoted Jew."1 When Noah is recalled today, it is usually because of his plan to establish a Jewish colony on Grand Island, near Buffalo in western New York State. To this would-be "City of Refuge"2 for the oppressed and persecuted Jews of the world, he gave the name "Ararat," a reference both to his own name and to the idea that the colony would be a temporary haven, a way station on the ultimate Jewish road to the Holy Land. Noah presented a cornerstone and inaugurated the plan in a highly theatrical ceremony held in Buffalo in 1825. Dressed in Shakespearean getup, he assumed the title "Judge of Israel," and in the local Episcopal church, he delivered a consecration speech in which he claimed to "revive, renew and re-establish the Government of the Jewish Nation under the auspices and protection of the constitution and laws of the United States of America," also calling for the ingathering of Native Americans as descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.3 Contemporaries such as Heinrich Heine found the scheme amusing, yet not a single Jew (or Indian) answered the internationally publicized call to settle in 1.

Nevertheless, by the 1830s, his concern for the Jewish people had led him to espouse proto-Zionist arguments for the large-scale settlement of Jews in Pales tine. "Every attempt to colonize the Jews in other countries has failed," he observed in an 1844 address. "Their eye has steadily rested on their own beloved Jerusalem."4 Felled by successive strokes half a century before Theodor Herzl would launch the modern Zionist movement, Noah remains a figure who stands unabashedly at the crossroads of American and Jewish history. He was an American patriot who saw fit to crown himself Judge of the Jews, and he was a prescient forerunner of modern Zionism whose initiatives toward reestablishing Jewish sovereignty emerged from a quintessentially American audacity. Small wonder, then, that in addition to a number of historical studies, the best being Jonathan Sarna's Jacksonian Jew: The Two Worlds of Mordecai Manuel Noah (1981), more than half a dozen works of literature have featured this colorful figure, including, most recently, the American graphic novelist Ben Katchor's The Jew of New York (1998) and Israeli novelist Nava Semel's 1-yisra'el (2005). In the following study, I will consider the ways in which, long after the death of the historical Noah, this important figure has continued to live on in the literary imagination. Writers in English, Yiddish, and Hebrew have all treated this character, their works inevitably reflecting the tensions inherent in Noah's simultaneous affirmation of both his Americanness and his Jewishness. These works function as bellwethers of attitudes toward both Amer ican and Jewish (or Israeli) national identities, expressing a range of ideological positions regarding ethnic, national, and linguistic belonging. The discussion that follows examines how writers have used the figure of Noah to try to reconcile Jewish national identity with the possibilities of American life.5 As this study emerges from my work on the immigrant Hebrew writers of the United States, two of whom I will discuss in this essay, I first want to meditate on Noah's resonance for that group and its cultural nationalism compared with writers working in other linguistic and ideological veins. It is not that the Hebraists devoted obsessive attention to Noah, at least not compared with the figure of the American Indian, an even more central motif for American Hebraist self understanding (and one that is intertwined with Noah as well).6 The two Hebrew writers to treat Noah at length were Harry Sackler, one of the more anom alous Hebraists because of his equal devotion to Yiddish and English, and Yohanan Twersky, a writer of historical fiction who lived for two decades in the United States. Nevertheless, we may take these writers' divergent representations 4. Ibid., 138. 5. My study is not exhaustive; there are literary mentions of Noah that are not dealt with here. I thank the anonymous reader of this essay for his or her helpful comments and for directing my attention to the appearance of Noah in Gore Vidal's novel Burr, which I do not treat here. 6.

Noah's Ararat project presented a compelling model for the Hebraists' understanding of their place in the United States. The example of Noah could be used, for example, to write America into the drama of Zionism?was not Theodor Herzl, in his endeavor to restore Jewish political sovereignty, preceded three quarters of a century earlier by, of all things, an American??thereby affirm ing the potential significance of the American Hebrew writers for the national Jewish project. Even more important, the concept of a temporary Jewish refuge in America was of great emotional resonance for the Hebraists, as it suited their ambivalence about seeing the United States as a permanent home. Noah had entertained the name "New Jerusalem" for his colony, but he decided on "Ararat," as it was not to become a long-term home for the Jews but rather a fortunate, if impermanent, haven. It was, he claimed, "an asylum" in which Jewish refugees might restore themselves physically and regenerate them selves intellectually in preparation for "that great and final restoration to their ancient heritage."7 Sackler's literary Noah is similarly emphatic that the colony not be considered a substitute for the Land of Israel: "To refresh oneself in Ararat?this is permitted," he says, "to remain there?forbidden."8 Or, as we find the thirteen-year-old Noah saying in a 1956 Hebrew children's book published by the Jewish Education Committee of New York: "The ark of the Jewish people has found a place of rest [in America]. It has found its Ararat. But heaven forbid that we forget the holy city of Jerusalem."9 Thus, the tension between the Hebraists' Jewish nationalism and their commitment to America as "home" is mirrored in the concept of the refuge, a term with interesting literary resonance in American Hebrew literature, extending beyond the works of Sackler and Twersky. For example, Refuge (in Hebrew, miklat) was the name of one of the most important Hebraist journals in the United States, edited during its short lifespan from 1919 to 1921 by Y D. Berkowitz, the son-in-law and Hebrew translator of Sholom Aleichem and an important Hebrew author in his own right. Appropriately enough, Berkowitz left the United States for Palestine in 1924, never having shed either his conviction that America was only a temporary refuge on his path to the Land of Israel or his overall distaste for the state of Jewish life in America. As Avraham Holtz has remarked in regard to Berkowitz's fiction, "[W]ere one to judge solely from Berkowitz's accounts, one would have to conclude that America played havoc with Jewish culture and literature. Berkowitz viewed the American Jew as a coarse, luxury-seeking figure, unmoved by ideals and 7. Noah, Selected Writings, 107. 8. Harry Sackler, Sefer hamahazot (New York: Ogen, 1943), 292.

Earlier, the nineteenth-century Hebrew satirist Gershon Rosenzweig had played on the notion of America as a "land of refuge" ( 'erez miklaf) in his irreverent Yankee Talmud, a send-up of American life in talmudic guise. "Our sages taught," runs this pseudo-scripture, "that America was created for no other purpose than to be a land of refuge."11 Rosenzweig's punch line then links this "land of refuge" to the biblical "cities of refuge" to which murderers are allowed to flee?making fun of America as a kind of ne'er-do-well's haven. He continues with another oft-used Hebrew-Aramaic pun on the word "America": Rav Safra said: Using astrology, Columbus foresaw that in the future America was to be a land of refuge for all the wanton and empty-headed people of the world, and he implored that the land should not be named after him, and so they called it an empty people ['ama reka\ Another Hebrew word that may be translated as "refuge" is miflat, the title of a story by the American Hebrew author Reuven Wallenrod (1899-1966) in which the writer savagely exposes the psychic paralysis faced by Jewish nationalists who go on resid ing in the United States, never reconciling themselves to their American home. The story has a certain autobiographical kernel in that Wallenrod, like many of the Heb raists, spent a number of years seeing himself as only a temporary resident in the United States, planning to immigrate to Israel when it became financially and profes sionally feasible.12 The story recounts the relationship between the appropriately named Gershon (an alien, as in Exodus 2:23) Dubin and his lover of five years, Bea trice. Wallenrod ably characterizes the emotional and mental states of Dubin when his relationship with Beatrice collapses?his sexual hunger, jealousy, emptiness, and depression?but the story centers less on the specificities of their relationship than on the fundamental ideological contradictions in Dubin's life, the real reasons why he is unable to find happiness and why Beatrice leaves him. Dubin lives an existence in which his ideals and values find no correlation to the world around him. As did so many of the Hebraists in America, Dubin works as a teacher in a Hebrew school in which he is treated with the utmost lack of respect by both his students and the admin istration. At the same time, his Zionist pretensions are mocked by Jews who point out that he is unwilling and unequipped to go to Palestine. Out of inertia, fear, and an inability to find a positive outlet for his values in the American environment, he drifts along in his limbo-like existence toward the inevitable crisis. 10.

His stu dents know that the religious traditions and Hebrew he teaches are not valued by their own parents or community except through a kind of vague sentimentality? and for that matter, Dubin himself is not religious?and they resent the idea of studying things that bear no relevance to anything in their lives. This is the back ground of the outrageous disrespect they show their teacher, a disrespect that is paralleled by the school administration. When Dubin complains to the school's vice president (and father of one of the most obnoxious students), telling him the truth?that the students behave for their English teacher because English is valued, whereas they run wild in their Torah class because Torah is not? he encounters the worst sort of obtuse sentimentalism of the American Jewish community, a mind-set that will not acknowledge assimilation and so must retreat into comforting mystical-biologistic notions of a Jewish essence that will never perish: Who can place a value on the Jewish soul? Our enemies think it has vanished, when it suddenly rises up and stands in all its purity, all its holiness. The Jewish soul, the Jewish spark will not disappear: they are passed down from generation to generation ... Consider, for instance, Doctor Theodor Zeev Herzl, or the greatest writer in all the world, the ardent Zionist Max Nordau, or the greatest professor in the world, Professor Albert Einstein ...13 The vice president's feel-good blather is the diametric opposite of the Hebraist insistence on learned culture as bulwark against an all-too-real erosion of Jewish identity. Dubin's experience was common among the Hebraist schooltea chers: Berkowitz referred to the Hebrew school in which he taught as "this hell,"14 and the American Hebrew poet Ephraim Lisitzky went so far as to compare Hebrew school teaching with black slavery. "I was delivered into slavery," he says of his work in the Talmud Torah of New Orleans: "Oh, the slavery of Israel,/in which the best of our poor Hebrew teachers have been placed/in the nation of America."15 Beatrice's leftist friends, meanwhile, have an equivalent contempt for Dubin, whose national and religious allegiances seem to have nothing to do with the urgencies of the various workers' movements. They call him a "reaction ary" and accuse him of purveying the "opium" of religion. Though their Marxist enthusiasms are themselves as puerile as the misbehavior of the children at Dubin's school (it is telling that Dubin recognizes the hate-filled looks of his students in the face of Beatrice's friend Karenin, who defends the Communist International's support for the Arab massacres of Jews in Palestine), these radicals, like the students, at least have the advantage over Dubin of seeking to find 13.

On the other hand, the bad faith of Dubin's life?and the lives of those like him?is pointed out repeatedly in the story, not least by Dubin himself, who is painfully aware of how disjointed and compartmentalized his life is. One object lesson is a young man named Perkins whom Dubin and Beatrice know at Columbia University, where they first met. Perkins is an enthusiastic Zionist who speaks and lectures about life in the Land of Israel. But when Beatrice expresses her admiration for Perkins, Dubin exposes the truth to her: "Do you know him? Tell me about him," she asked. "A teacher in the Talmud Torah." "Why doesn't he go to the Land of Israel? He loves the land so much." "He'll go when he's sure that everything there is fine and dandy." "You're always dismissive." With a laugh he told her about Perkins. His acquaintances told him that Perkins had once gone to a training farm, but that he avoided all work, and at the first opportunity left for America. When his fellow townsmen would ask him about his trip, he would say: "My wish is to be useful to the Land of Israel ... I want to perfect myself in America ... To the Land of Israel, via America." His whole town accompanied him to the train station, dancing and singing: "We'll meet again in the Land of Israel ..." "And here?" "Here he's a 'teacher' like me. He doesn't live in the Land of Israel, and he doesn't live in America."16 Clinging to the justification that America is a temporary way station on the road to the Land of Israel, Perkins and Dubin have fallen into an existence as "teachers"? with scare quotes, as we see, because "teacher" becomes a term for Jewish nationalists who are avoiding (though, it must be said, for often very palpable and pressing reasons) the choices of life and so live neither in America nor in the Land of Israel but in a ghostly between state. One of Beatrice's friends, a former fellow of Dubin's in the Poalei Zion movement, enjoys battening sadisti cally on Dubin's psychic unhappiness and finally elicits an enraged punch in the face from Dubin when he pushes him too far by exposing his paralysis: Let's be frank: so you've been a Zionist for decades, even a member of the workers' party, so to speak ... Now then, first of all, you don't go there [to Palestine] ... and if you even went, would you work there?... Just between us ... even here you don't want to work ... even here you teach American chil dren to recite the Shema ... what could you do there?17 It is no surprise that Beatrice finally leaves Dubin. Dubin's very love for Beatrice forces him into the masochistic role of exposing his own inadequacies to her. She wants to live in the world, whereas Dubin seeks refuge from it, and so she 16. Wallenrod, Badiotah hashlishit, 79. 17. Ibid., 93. 80</page><page sequence="7">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge leaves him. The story ends with Dubin undergoing a total nervous breakdown, his madness becoming his final "refuge."18 The story depicts?in extreme terms?the psychic burden of the Hebraists in America. Although some Hebrew writers, such as Sackler, were able to synthesize their Jewish national allegiances with their sense of being part of the United States, others, such as Twersky, rejected America definitively in the end, immigrating to Israel. Sackler's and Twersky's treatments of Noah dramatize these themes and tensions, as do, in very different ways, the treatments of Noah by the other writers we will examine. In reviewing the history of these literary representations of Noah, we begin, however, not with a Hebrew writer of the twentieth century but with a major American writer of the nineteenth century? admittedly, one who did not expand at length on the theme of Mordecai Manuel Noah yet whose brief reference to him is appropriately woven into a fascinating discourse on what it means to be American. * * * When William Dean Howells is mentioned in connection with Jewish litera ture, it is usually because of his championing of the work of Abraham Cahan. As is well known to historians of American ethnic literature, Howells, perhaps the most influential arbiter of literary taste in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America, hailed the author of Yekl, a Tale of the New York Ghetto (1896) as "a new star of realism," enabling Cahan's entry into the English-language literary world. Our interest in Howells, however, does not concern Cahan but stems instead from a novel that Howells wrote a good quarter century before he lauded Cahan's tales of Lower East Side immigrant life. Their Wedding Journey (1871) was Howells's first novel. Not often read today, it nevertheless stands as one of the more resonant meditations on American identity of its period, display ing in its ironic probings of the American scene and character easy fellowship with works by Howells's friend Mark Twain that appeared at the same time, such as The Innocents Abroad (1869) and Roughing It (1872). Howells hardly dilates on Mordecai Manuel Noah in the novel; the reference to Noah is made in passing. And yet a look at Howells's novel must commence our review of Noahliteratur because his meditations on American identity, the role of America's minorities, and the use of romantic American tropes are, with the addition of considerations of Jewish nationalism, the basic materials of nearly all subsequent treatments of Noah. Following the American romances of Noah's own plays, writings, and life, our story begins with a well-placed reference in Their Wedding Journey. As its title indicates, the novel follows a recently married couple on their honeymoon as they make their way to that already legendary postnuptial destina tion, Niagara Falls. Based on an actual trip taken by Howells and his wife, the attraction of the novel derives from the parallel it sets up between its examination of America and the protagonists' reflections on their own relationship. Howells 18. Ibid., 98. 81</page><page sequence="8">Michael Weingrad and his wife were thirtyish when they made their own trek to the Falls, and the similarly aged protagonists of the novel are highly conscious of the fact that they are older than most newlyweds. To the clich?s of their Niagara pilgrimage, and even those of their own romance, therefore, they bring an experienced, critical, and de-idealizingly self-aware eye. It is this cooler view that Ho wells and his char acters also bring to their exploration of post-Civil War America, deflating roman tic icons and American myths. Critics applauded this portrayal of, in the words of one reviewer, "our American life exactly as we see it."19 Indeed, the novel, which followed on Ho wells's well-received Italian travel sketches, was intended as an affirmation of the worth and interest of American experience honestly portrayed. The character of the husband, Basil March, strikes this note in the opening pages when the itinerary for this decidedly non-European voyage is provided: Basil had said that as this was their first journey together in America [the couple had met in Europe], he wished to give it at the beginning as pungent a national character as possible, and that as he could imagine nothing more peculiarly American than a voyage to New York by a Fall River boat, they ought to take that route thither.20 Yet this gravitation toward the "peculiarly American" simultaneously risks a dis orienting and unsentimental questioning of what the national character is in a country that, like Basil and his wife Isabel, is no longer quite in the frill flush of youth. Approaching its centennial at the time the novel was written, the United States was going through myriad changes and seemed to be in a position to test its own self-mythologizings. As Howells wrote to a friend in the same year the novel appeared, "I feel more and more persuaded that we only have to study Amer ican life with the naked eye in order to find it infinitely various and entertaining. The trouble has always been that we have looked at it through somebody else's confounded literary telescope."21 Indeed, one of the most humorous moments in the novel comes when the Marches arrive at Niagara and encounter Native Americans who fail to conform to romantic literary expectations, in particular that of the dying tribe clinging tena ciously to its folk traditions while disappearing from the face of the earth.22 At first, the Indians do seem to play to type: "like the woods and the wild faces of the cliffs and precipices," their picturesque yet unobtrusive presence helps "to keep the cataract remote, and to invest it with the charm of primeval loneliness."23 Yet when Isabel, purchasing a souvenir trinket from an Indian woman, asks the 19.

"But her Indian name?" Isabel persists. "'She has none,' answered the woman, who told Basil that her village numbered five hundred people, and that they were Protestants." Isabel complains afterward to her husband, "But, how shocking that they should be Christians, and Protestants! It would have been bad enough to have them Catholics. And that woman said that they were increasing. They ought to be fading away."24 If the Indians, rather than fading away, seem to be becoming modern Amer icans, other putatively American groups who refuse or are unable to do so are likened to the image of the dying Indian. In this post-Civil War novel, a southern gentleman at the Niagara resort is described in precisely these terms, with his com bination of savagery and twilight nobility, eliciting feelings of tragic pity. "He had an air at once fierce and sad," we are told, "and a half-barbaric, homicidal gentility of manner fascinating enough in its way." Basil finds that he "can't help feeling towards him as towards a fallen prince," in spite of the evils of slavery and war. "This gentle man, and others like him," he muses to his wife, "used to be the lords of our summer resorts.... Now they're moneyless and subjugated (as they call it)."25 Nobility, Indian or otherwise, is not the guarantor of inclusion in contemporary American life. The real key to this participation is money. Howells describes the Marches as being "of the American race, which finds nothing too good for it that its money can buy."26 In the democratizing atmosphere of the market, class distinc tions are famously irrelevant. On the steamboat from New York City up the Hudson River, the Marches observe a nouveau riche mixing unconcernedly with a "heredi tary aristocrat," the latter representing "nothing ... but a social set, an alien club life."27 On the other hand, a couple of Jewish immigrants on the boat, representatives of the mid-nineteenth-century wave of mass Jewish immigration, seem, despite their foreign accents and stereotyped concern with commerce, to epitomize at the same time the giddy entrepreneurial spirit of the American scene. The Marches eavesdrop on these "two Hebrews," one of whom is holding forth on how to succeed at selling coats. "Isaac'11 zell him the goat he wands him to puy," he says of an acquaintance, "and he'll make him believe it's the goat he was he was a-lookin' for ... but the thing is to make him puy the goat that you wand to zell when he don't wand no goat at all."2* I do not want to ignore the antisemitic portrayal of Jews as obsessed with com merce, yet it must be pointed out that in the American environment, it is the "heredi tary aristocrat" who belongs to "an alien club-life." The blue blood, like the southerner, is the fossil, whereas the Jewish immigrants, observing that success in business is not merely to provide a needed commodity but to create an entirely new desire, exemplify the new American scene. Niagara Falls is, appropriately, the central instance in the novel of the romantic American myth, the primeval force and pristine beauty of nature, the 24. Ibid., 86. 25. Ibid., 95-96. 26.

And, in fact, to skip for a moment to the resolution of the novel, something powerful does survive: Romance, whether of a couple or a nation, is not solely a joke, a clich?, or an illu sion. The splendor of the Falls overcomes the Marches, shattering the "patronizing spirit in which we approach everything nowadays."29 This encounter with the sublime is not a simple sweet elation, but a breaking down. Confronting the sheer awesome force of the cataract, they find themselves "dispersed and sub jected," a pregnant phrase suggesting their own membership in some lost Jewish or Indian tribe.30 Yet this affirmation of the enduring power of the Falls follows on a quite sustained attempt at de-idealization. As we have already seen, the Niagara's Indians are not the romantic solitary chief or the maiden throwing himself or herself over the Falls. Howells notes the mundane, commercial aspects of Niagara, from the arrival of the Marches at the station, when Isabel "was sure she should have heard" the sound of the Falls had it not been for "the vulgar little noises that attend the arrival of trains at Niagara as well as everywhere else," to the kiosks everywhere selling "feather fans, and miniature bark canoes, and jars and vases and bracelets and brooches carved out of the local rocks."31 Howells's designation of these tourist knick-knacks as "barbaric wares" seems to have as much to do with his meditation on the consumers as on the producers. The couple must contend with the jostling and noise of their fellow tourists, the importunings of commercial photographers. And the narrator, closely identified here with Basil, delivers a speech that is intended to entrap and neutralize the romance of Niagara in the web of historical consciousness. "Niagara," the narrator begins, "is an awful homicide."32 It is drenched in a long history of bloodshed and barbarity, from the first inhabitants of the area, "abominable savages ... leading a life of demoniacal misery and wickedness," to "the ferocious Iroquois bloodily driving out these squalid devil-worshippers," followed by the arrival of French settlers, who sowed "the seeds of war that fruited afterwards in murderous strifes," wars between the French and the English, Indian attacks of American settlements during the Revolutionary War, "the savage forays with tomahawk and scalping-knife, and the blazing villages on either shore in the war of 1812"?all these constitute "the memories of the place, the links in a chain of tragical interest scarcely broken before our time since the white man first beheld the mist-veiled face of Niagara." This meditation on the history of the Falls culminates in a reference that differs from what precedes it in that it does not involve violence or death. 29. Ibid., 103-104. 30. Ibid., 104. 31.

Yet Howells's remembrance of Noah at the apex of this history of Niagara and its follies is quite perceptive. Noah's Jewish American fusions make him a necessary precursor to the novel's dizzy r?sum? of this new and changing, brash and hybrid America. Moreover, Noah is linked with Niagara as a symbol of an American vitality that, for all its folly, will never be completely ironized or dismissed. Noah is presented here as part of the true and ugly record of American failure and "yet not ignoble," just as all the de-idealizations of the novel eventually recede before a core of grandeur, a reaffirmation of romantic aspirations, even if necessarily more hard-bitten and selective. Noah is therefore both part of the American past and a significant image for the American future, on whose threshold Howells stands, a totem for those "half pathetic, half ludicrous" dreams that nevertheless have a way of coming true. * * * How true, Howells could not have known. Yet Noah's significance as a precursor of modem Zionism would soon be mined. The first author to do this, thereby giving Noah a central place in a work of fiction, was Israel Zangwill, the most prominent Anglo-Jewish intellectual to express the dilemmas of modem Jewish identity and to take a role in programs of Jewish national renewal. The author of such cultural touchstones as The Melting Pot and Children of the Ghetto, Zangwill chaired the 1895 meeting at which Theodor Herzl first pre sented his plan for a state of the Jews. As Zangwill's biographer, Joseph Udelson, notes, he "reacted to Herzl's program with a mixture of confusion, ambivalence, and skepticism."34 Nevertheless, by 1901, Zangwill had become an impassioned Zionist and a supporter of Herzl. More famously, he supported Herzl's Uganda initiative of 1903?the idea of setting up a Jewish colony in Africa, decisively rejected by the Zionist movement?and continued for some time after to champion geographic alternatives to the Zionist insistence on the Land of Israel as the location for a Jewish state. At least part of Zangwill's agitated ambivalence about Herzl's Zionism was his fear that the plan would not be realized and that, 33. Ibid., 89-90. 34. Joseph H. Udelson, Dreamer of the Ghetto: The Life and Works of Israel Zangwill (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1990), 156. 85</page><page sequence="12">Michael Weingrad should this be the case, only "suicide, self-immolation remained as an acceptable alternative" for the modern Jew.35 All of these competing tendencies can be seen in Zangwill's story "Noah's Ark," which was first published in 1899. Zangwill imagines the fate of a German Jew who decides to take Noah up on his call to settle Ararat. Peloni (the name is the Hebrew equivalent of "so-and-so") is a maskil and Hebrew poet living in Frankfurt. (The character is not the only Hebrew poet in Zangwill's corpus: the "neo-Hebrew poet" Melchitsedek in Children of the Ghetto was famously modeled on Naphtali Hertz Imber. Zangwill seems to nod to the Hebrew poets who imagined the Jewish national revival in advance of much of the actual poli tics.) We first find Peloni loitering in the cemetery, an appropriate location for a Jew who feels there is no viable path in modernity. Disillusioned with the possi bility of emancipation because of rising antisemitism?he has just been attacked in the street?Peloni soon finds Noah's proclamation posted on the synagogue door and, despite the derision of the other Jews, is captivated by the idea of Ararat. Disgusted by the passivity of his fellow Jews, he sets out for America, where he is entrusted by Noah with the task of planting a flag on Grand Island and waiting there to greet arriving Jews. Given Zangwill's later career as a proponent of territorialism (the advocacy of a Jewish state somewhere other than in the Land of Israel), it is certainly tempt ing to read this story as a foreshadowing of the territorialist position. Indeed, when examining literary representations of Mordecai Noah and his Ararat plan, we must in each case determine to what extent the author is using Noah's project as a meta phor for Zionism, in which case Ararat is a figure for the Land of Israel, and to what extent the treatment is meant to be taken more narrowly as a commentary on the fate of Jewish nationalism outside Palestine?keeping in mind that most authors indicate a combination of the two possibilities. In the case of Zangwill's story, although he would later be associated with territorialism, we would do best not to insist on the more literal geography. Here, Zangwill's Ararat project is clearly a metaphor for Herzl's Zionism, and in fact, Zangwill's Noah is a figure for Herzl himself. This comparison was probably irresistible given the simi larities between these two historical figures?both assimilated Jews, both journal ists, both playwrights, both visionaries, both impresarios?and Zangwill (who shared some of same characteristics) would not be the last to link them. In this story, the comparison is not terribly flattering: Zangwill's Noah is self-regarding, vain, cocksure, and more interested in the theatrics of the plan than the practicalities and work that might ensure its success. In short, Zangwill's Noah represents everything that both fascinated and worried Zangwill about Herzl. Yet although the Herzl/Noah portrait is somewhat critical, "Noah's Ark" does not reduce to a simple critique of Zionist politics. As Udelson notes, the story expresses Zangwill's attraction to Herzlian Zionism, along with his fear that if the plan should fail, there could be no viable Jewish future. It is a story of desperate hopefulness or optimistic despair. 35. Ibid., 115. 86</page><page sequence="13">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refiige Zangwill presents Ararat not as an unworkable folly but as a plan that might very well have succeeded had numbers of Jews been willing to follow Peloni in heeding Noah's call. The backwater settlement of Buffalo, Zangwill reflects rue fully, will grow into a thriving town because of the initiative of its citizens, yet Grand Island remains unpopulated by any Jews save Peloni, who waits for months alone in the wilderness with his flag (which has seven stars, just like Herzl's initial proposal for the flag of the Jewish state). Niagara Falls, erroneously placed next to Noah's island just as Howells had done, shifts in its symbolism from a promise of renewed Jewish vitality ("Force, Life, Strength, that was what Israel needed") to an indifferent fate that the Jews are powerless to resist: "The very rain bows on the leaping mist were now only reminders of the biblical promise that the world would go on forever; forever the wheel would turn, and Israel would wander homeless."36 Zangwill's anguished consideration of the possible demise of the Jewish people links the Jews with the figure of the Indian, an oft-repeated comparison in American Hebrew literature and one that Nava Semel has recently developed at length in her novel. At the end of Zangwill's story, the long-waiting Peloni finally receives a message from Noah that he has abandoned the Ararat plan. Noah now hopes for an even more unlikely Jewish restoration in Palestine, to be achieved through the outcome of imperial power struggles among England, Russia, and the Ottomans?in other words, contemporary political Zionism. Peloni, who has no hopes for Noah's new scheme, comes to the conclusion that the Jews have simply lost their will to live. Peloni looks up to find the Iroquois chief Red Jacket standing before him. In fact, the Seneca chief of that name attended the real Noah's Ararat inauguration in Buffalo, but apparently he declined the invitation to join the Jewish city of refuge. In Zangwill's story, the Jewish immigrant and the Native American chieftain, "the puny, stooping scholar from the German Ghetto, and the stalwart, kingly savage," converse, and Peloni realizes that Jews are like this other vanishing race.37 They "were indeed brothers: the Jew who stood for the world that could not be bom again, and the Red Indian who stood for the world that must pass away. Yes, they were both doomed." Appropriately, then, Peloni dies according to the classic fashion of romantic image of the doomed Indian, throwing himself over the Falls. The cornerstone of Ararat, lying forgotten in the Buffalo Historical Society, is therefore not only the marker of Noah's failed project for Jewish political restoration but also "the gravestone of Peloni."38 Zangwill's story is an allegory for the hopes and fears connected with con temporary Zionism. Its interest in America is only inadvertent and metaphorical. By contrast, the other English-language endeavor of that time to feature Noah treats him in a purely American context, with only a passing reference to Jewish nationalism. The Noah of Alfred Henry Lewis's 1902 best-selling novel 36. Israel Zangwill, Selected Works (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1938), 116, 118. 37. Ibid., 121. 38. Ibid., 123. 87</page><page sequence="14">Michael Weingrad Peggy O Neal is quite surprising. A Cleveland-born newspaperman and western ranch hand turned New York muckraker, Lewis was already the author of a suc cessful series of westerns when, responding to the turn-of-the-century demand for historical fiction, he produced this melodramatic page-turner.39 Basing his novel on the Eaton Affair, a scandal of the 1820s that had an impact on the presidency of Andrew Jackson, Lewis departs considerably from strict historical accuracy. Indeed, the very inclusion of Noah as a major character is striking, as Noah had nothing remotely significant to do with the Eaton Affair. Nevertheless, in Lewis's novel, Noah is not only one of the central characters but also perhaps its most impressive. Though the Indians, Mexicans, and blacks of Lewis's western novels are drawn with the racist condescension typical of the time, the Jewish Noah of Peggy O 'Neal is exceptionally heroic, self-effacing, and capable. Though in reality, Noah was, at that point in his life, well on his way to becoming a portly family man, Lewis's Noah appears in the novel as a kind of early nineteenth-century James Bond: suave, quick thinking, and deadly with a sword. He exhibits the manly valor and willingness to shed blood when necessary that Lewis admired in Andrew Jackson and, one presumes, in Teddy Roosevelt in his own day. As the narrator observes (in the pseudo early-nineteenth-century diction used in the novel): Noah was of culture and quiet penetration; withal cunning and fertile to a degree. Also I found his courage to be the steadiest; he would fight with slight reason, and had in a duel some twenty years before, with the first fire, killed one Cantor, a flamboyant person?the world might well spare him?on the Charleston racetrack, respectably and at ten paces.40 Elsewhere, Noah is referred to as "our cool gentleman of the red hair, the jet eyes, and the sharp Spanish swords."41 As President Jackson says in the novel, "to me he is the man remarkable; fine, high, yet bold and quick, there will be no one to take his place when he is gone."42 Lewis's Noah is not at all ashamed of his Jewishness. When an antis?mite disparages him as a "Jackson Jew," he responds witheringly, "Jew, yes! My ancestors were poets, lawgivers?they read the stars, and collected the wisdom and learning of the world, when the slant-skulled fore-fathers of [some] I might indicate went clothed of sheepskin and club, ate their meat raw, and saved their fire to pray to."43 And in the duel that follows, before which Noah learns that his opponent is one of the finest swordsmen in the state of Maryland, Noah professionally dissects his opponent's arm?"split it 39.

Lewis's is a strikingly non-Zionist Noah. There is only one reference, speculative and in passing, to Jewish nationalism, when the narrator muses that Noah, a descendant of David (both have red hair), "would be a present King of the Jews were it not that the latter owned neither country nor home."45 On the contrary, Noah is consistently used to emphasize the superlative American patriotism and loyalty of Jews. When the antis?mite just mentioned says that he would like to expel every Jew from the United States, Noah returns, "The Jew is as much the American as you. My father fought for this country; I have fought for it; the Jews found and gave one-third of that money which won the Revolution."46 And it is not only Noah who makes the case for Jews as loyal and upright American citizens; the non-Jewish characters do so as well. "Your Jew makes a stout patriot," affirms the narrator, "I could want no better American than a Jew."47 Writing in the midst of the greatest period of Jewish mass migration from eastern Europe, Lewis affirms the Americanness and honor of Jews while leaving aside consideration of Jewish nationalism. * * * The first literary author to put Noah into Hebrew was Harry Sackler, who dramatized the Ararat plan in his play "Mashiah nosah 'amerikah" (Messiah, American style). Sackler's Noah, like Zangwill's, has everything to do with the projects and pitfalls of Jewish nationalism. Yet the Jewish nationalism of Sackler's Noah is presented as profoundly American. Sackler's is an attempt to resolve the tensions between American and Jewish national identities, an approach in keeping with the author's personality and career. Though deeply devoted to Zionism and Jewish causes, Sackler's Zionism very much reflected the emerging American Zionism of philanthropic solicitude for the Jewish people rather than dedication to a specific political theory.48 Nor was he a purist when it came to the linguistic debates and camps of his day. Indeed, as did very few other figures (Judd Teller comes to mind), Sackler moved with some success between the worlds of Hebrew, Yiddish, and English in the course of his long career as a writer and community leader. Though he 44. Ibid., 131. 45. Ibid., 72. 46. Ibid., 109. 47. Ibid., 408. 48. Apart from his literary career, Sackler served as secretary general of the New York Kehila (1917-18); was on the staff of the Zionist Organization of America (1918-23), the Board of Jewish Education (1923-26), and the Brooklyn Jewish Community Council (1940^14); and was an executive member of the Joint Distribution Committee (1945-55).

Involved throughout his life in American Hebrew literature and culture, his status as a Hebraist in good standing was questioned by partisans of that language, just as he was never entirely accepted by Yiddishists as an ideologi cally loyal Yiddish writer. Speaking of the mutual suspicion between the Hebraist and Yiddishist camps, he explains, "I was innocently dragged along after both languages and both literatures at the same time. Ancient tradition and culture and new hope on the one hand; vitality and popular expression and utility for millions on the other."49 Sackler had been writing poems and stories in Hebrew since the age of four teen, but he made his debut in print in Yiddish, in a 1907 issue of the Forward, and in the 1910s, he served as an editor for Yiddish publications such as Dos Idishe Folk and the Morgen Zhornal. By the 1920s, Sackler's Yiddish plays were being performed to acclaim throughout the Yiddish-speaking world, from New York and Chicago to Warsaw and Buenos Aires. At no point, however, did Sackler cease his literary production in Hebrew, although this never won him the popularity of his Yiddish work. He was active on the staff of Hatoren, and in 1920, he visited Palestine as a correspondent for both Hatoren and the Yiddish Der Tog. His Hebrew publications appeared in journals such as Hadror, Shi bolim, Luah 'ahi 'ever, Hatoren, and Hado 'ar, and the Hebrew versions of his plays (several were written originally in Hebrew, some were self-translated from Yiddish or English) were also performed by amateur and small Hebrew troupes. In addition, he published works in English, including the novel Festival at Meron. Typically, then, Sackler's play about Noah was first written and performed in Yiddish under the title "Major Noah," and only later was it translated by the author into Hebrew, a Hebrew that often reads syntactically as a comfortably col loquial English or Yiddish. The Yiddish original appeared in print in 1928 in the author's collected Yiddish plays and had its stage premier in 1929 at Morris Schwartz's esteemed Yidishe Kunst-Teater. Schwartz played the title role. The production won positive reviews, with the notable exception of Abraham Cahan, who, in a dyspeptic review in the Forward, argued that the play was mere historical research, lacking in dramatic tension.50 By contrast, the critic Shmuel Niger and the poet Aaron Glants-Leyeles, both writing in Der Tog, found the historical dimension to be precisely part of the play's attraction. Niger in particular judged the play to be "an achievement in the world of Yiddish drama" and maintained that introducing his audience to the figure of Noah was not the least of Sackler's merits.51 Niger urged people to see the play in order to learn about this forgotten episode in American and Jewish history, an episode 49.

By this, he meant not only that Herzl had been preceded by an American Jew but also that the very idea of a Jewish state had something particularly American about it in its audacity, bold pragmatism, and ecumenical faith. Noah is superlatively American in his boundless energy, determination, and optimism, and the United States?rather than nineteenth-century nationalism?is the true model for the idea of the Jewish State. "Hadn't Noah all but seen with his own eyes how states had arisen from colonies," Niger writes, "how scattered settlements had begun to grow into a world power?" Sackler's play suggested to Niger that it was not simply oppression and persecution that drove Jews to messianic and redemptive projects. Freedom and relative integration, such as Noah had known in the United States, could equally inspire such efforts. In short, as Glants Leyeles writes, Sackler had written "a truly Jewish-American play."52 Sackler must have appreciated such responses: He took the title of Niger's review?"Messiah, American Style"?for the title of his Hebrew version of the play. Indeed, throughout the play, Sackler links Noah's proto-Zionism with an American combination of initiative, bluff, will, and dynamism. Of course, some of the hutzpah in Sackler's portrait of Noah is not confined to the American context, but plays instead on the same comparison with Herzl seen in Zangwill's story. That is, Sackler, a dramaturge-activist like Zangwill and Herzl and Noah, makes sure to emphasize the theatricality inherent in pr?state Zionism, the way that the Jewish state was an act of imagination, an illusion becoming reality, a spectacle. "Tonight, my friend, you will see a wondrous production," says Noah to one of his companions?an old theater comrade, in fact?on the evening he announces the Ararat plan.53 "Your performance, Noah, goes well," admits another character on the day of Ararat's public dedication. "You are an expert at the creation of theatrical effects."54 Indeed, Sackler noted later in his memoirs that some who had seen the play had been surprised to find such a de-idealized character?Noah is sympathetic, dynamic, and good-natured but not free of ego and self-promotion?used to symbolize Zionist leadership. Even more notable is the ecumenical emphasis of the play. It is the Christian character Van Doren?who knows Hebrew and is knowledgeable about the Bible?who first supports the idea of a Jewish state, even when the Jewish char acters still consider the idea to be a joke. "President of a Jewish republic," laughs one of Noah's Jewish companions when the idea is proposed that Noah might be leader of such a state: "Where? In Jerusalem?" "What is the meaning of this mockery, my Jewish friends," responds Van Doren: "Why not"?55 Sackler 52. Aaron Glants-Leyeles, "H. Sekler's Mayor Noach," Der tog, February 22, 1929. 53.

Van Doren is also the name of a character in Sackler's novel Bein 'erez veshamayim who is an impassioned Zionist and joins the Jewish Brigade to fight in Palestine during the World War I. Van Doren and Avner, the novel's protagonist, have an admiring conversation about Mordecai Manuel Noah, whom they both recognize as an American precursor to the Zionist project. See Sackler, Bein 'erez veshamayim: roman (Tel Aviv: Yavneh, 1964), 390. 91</page><page sequence="18">Michael Weingrad similarly emphasizes the Christian faith of Samuel Leggett, Noah's real estate partner in the effort to acquire land for Ararat. The fullest expression of this ecu menical impulse is seen in the striking tableau that Noah (and Sackler) creates in the second act, when Noah consecrates himself to the Ararat plan by gathering together a Jew ("a symbol of the people Israel"), an Indian ("the symbol of freedom"), and a Christian ("symbol and model of what Christianity strives to be") in what Noah calls a "holy covenant"?which takes place under a Jewish prayer shawl with the help of the Reverend Addison Searle of the Episcopal Church of Buffalo: Noah: Help me, Searle. (He and Searle spread the talit and wrap the three; in a cer emonial chanting) In the name of the God of the Universe, glorious God who created Man in His image, I proclaim the unity of all mankind in freedom, in noble striving, in mutual love and friendship! Searle: Forever and ever, amen! The others: Amen! Amen!56 Moreover, Noah's main antagonist in the play is a rabbi who is as opposed to the ecumenicism of Noah's plan as he is to its proto-Zionism. Noah's opponents also include the elite of the Jewish community, who are reluctant to rock the boat in America by promoting Noah's scheme. However, it is Rabbi Peixotto who, until the final scene of the play, is Noah's chief opponent. Outraged by the pseudo-messianic heresy that is implicit in Noah's attempt to hasten redemption, Peixotto symbolizes the traditionalist opposition that would emerge against Zionism in Herzl's time. (Peixotto is not entirely unsympathetic, however; Sackler was not dismissive of traditional Judaism, and his play does consider cri tically the pretensions of the Zionist leadership in his own day.) Yet Peixotto also fills the role, well-known in Yiddish and American ethnic melodrama, of the Old World traditionalist who tries to thwart the aspirations of the young American gen eration. In Sackler's play, Noah holds the inaugural ceremony for Ararat in the Episcopal Church of Buffalo not only because of the problems transporting all the participants and spectators to Grand Island (as it happened in real life) but also because this is a way of excluding Rabbi Peixotto, who had planned to disrupt the ceremony but cannot bring himself to enter a church. Act III ends with telling symbolism as a procession of soldiers, freemasons, notables, and Indians all march to the church, accompanied by peals of cannon fire. When Noah's Christian partner Leggett cries, "The great republic of the United States blesses Ararat!" the rabbi holds his hands over his ears lamenting, "Woe is me! Woe is me! To a Christian church he leads them!"57 Sackler's play is an attempt to harmonize Jewish national aspirations with American ecumenism and patriotism. Such harmonization is reflected not only in the content but also in the genre. The play is not solely a historical drama but a comedy of errors. In Sackler's play, the Ararat plan functions as a melodramatic 56. Sackler, Sefer hamahazot, 301. 57. Ibid., 318. 92</page><page sequence="19">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge device in Noah's relationship with his sweetheart, Esther Jackson, first dividing them, then uniting them when Esther works to help Noah achieve his goals. In real life, Noah did not marry until years after the Ararat episode, and Sackler has also changed Noah's wife's name from Rebecca to Esther, presumably to pair an Esther with a Mordecai and so lend a touch of Purimspiel to the play. As Sackler imagines it, moreover, the role of Esther is clearly that of an emancipated, free-spirited, American-born woman who can more than hold her own with men. When holding a pistol, she brags that she has "never missed a target at ten paces."58 The play ends, as comedies do, with their intention to marry, and the final curtain falls on their kiss, a resolution intended to satisfy all parties. Rabbi Peix otto, who comes across as not such a bad type after all, is assured that, with a wife by his side, Noah will be less inclined to pursue dangerous schemes, while Noah vows that, on the contrary, together with his new wife, he will continue working for the Jewish nation. Together, vows Noah, they "will build a Jewish house" (or "a Hebrew house," in the Hebrew version), and Esther agrees: "from our house Mordecai will begin anew his work of building the house of the Jewish People."59 This conclusion therefore attempts to fuse the Zionist-historical and American-comedic plotlines, celebrating the Noah/Jackson household as a renewed starting point for Jewish nationalist projects. The happy American couple can fight together for the Jewish future. Good Americans can also be good Jewish nationalists. Of course, the historical Noah had to contend with a significant amount of antisemitism in his career. His political opponents were never above trying to use his Jewishness against him. Sackler's play notes that Noah's Jewishness was cited as a reason for removing him from his post as U.S. consul in Tunis.60 Other ten sions between the affirmation of Americanness and Jewishness show up occasion ally in the play, as when Noah begins a speech to a group of Jews about the Ararat plan but is interrupted: Hart: Excuse me, my dear Noah. When you speak of "our people," to whom are you referring? To the Jews? To the Americans? Noah: Our people, mister Hart! The Jewish people.61 Yet such are rare exceptions to the dominant mode of the play, in which Sackler articulates a particularly American kind of Jewish nationalism that is faithful to both American integration and Jewish national pride and is largely untroubled by the tensions between them?in short, the easygoing Zionism that would become the primary form among American Jews. It was, tellingly, a review in the Hebrew Hado'ar that questioned whether Sackler's apparent resolution of the tensions?comedie versus historical, integrationist versus nationalist?was 58. Ibid., 317. 59. Ibid., 330. 60. See Sarna, Jacksonian Jew, for a judicious analysis of the role antisemitism did and did not play in this episode. 61.

"At the end," writes the reviewer, "when the matter is settled through the marriage of Noah to Esther Jackson, everyone?both the actors and the audi ence?appeared to be fully satisfied with the outcome, with no regret on our part at the abandonment of the plan."62 This was, the reviewer continues, a "poor indi cation for the actors" who, it is implied, might have been able to convey a greater degree of ambivalence and contradiction. The happy ending, the synthesis of Americanism and Jewish nationalism, was too successful and therefore untme. * * * This would certainly have been the opinion of Yohanan Twersky (1900 1967, in the United States 1926-47), who, as the title of his 1954 historical novel 'Eifo 'erez Ararat? (Where Is Ararat?) indicates, insisted that the Jew must decide where his homeland is. For Sackler, one could maintain one's Jewish and American national commitments with no irresoluble tensions. For Twersky, one must decide where Ararat (i.e., one's genuine rather than temporary homeland) ultimately is. It cannot be both Zion and America; one constitutes an abandonment of the other. Twersky's novel is therefore about the unavoidable need to make that choice, both on a personal and a national level. Despite his considerable attraction to American culture and American possibilities and the striking extent (greater even than Sackler) to which Twersky Americanizes the origins of Noah's Jewish nationalist project, the author answers the title's question definitively. The homeland of the Jews is not in the United States but in the Land of Israel, a perspective that Twersky himself embodied when, after living for two decades in Boston, he immigrated to Israel.63 As Gershon Shaked has noted, Twersky's historical fictions (he wrote a dozen such novels on subjects ranging from Rashi to Ahad Ha'am) are less attempts to recreate the past than ideological (Zionist) commentaries on the present, structured around sentimental-melodramatic plotlines.64 Where Is Ararat? is no exception. The novel is less concerned with creating an authentic historical atmosphere than it is with pondering the central ideological questions of the novel through any and all historical figures with which Noah might have come in contact?and even some with whom he most assuredly did not. As such, the novel includes internal monologues of Thomas Jefferson and Rahel Vamhagen, possible but extremely improbable encounters between Noah and such historical personages as Joseph Smith and Robert Owen, and anachronisms such as a subplot in which Noah must contend with a rival newspaperman named Greeley?presumably Horace Greeley, who would have been a boy at the time. Moreover, the novel frequently gestures overtly toward the contemporary world, as occurs in a post-Holocaust reflection on one early nineteenth-century 62. Haim Weiner, "Bate'atron, 'Mayor Noach,'" Hado'ar 9, no. 17 (1929): 292. 63.

The kaleidoscopic approach of the novel, in which anything and everything become pieces of the puzzle of Jewish destiny, is mirrored by the passivity of its central character, who mainly functions in the novel as psychological-ideological clay, molded by the events, forces, and personalities around him. Twersky's Noah is a young idealist, a sensitive soul searching for meaning, for the solutions to his own identity and his people's predicament. Brave and always concerned with ful filling his personal and communal responsibilities, he nevertheless lacks the vital ity of Sackler's Noah and the egotistical drive of Zangwill's character, to say nothing of the martial determination of Lewis's. The historical Noah was a wheeler-dealer, a self-promoter, a man who made things happen and did not go through life?as Twersky's character often does?as the recipient of events. Twersky's Noah is never more insecure and uncomfortable than when he appears at the dedication of Ararat, robed as the Judge of Israel. In short, the real Noah was more of an early nineteenth-century American than Twersky makes him, the Hebrew novelist having instead created a figure who, one guesses, thinks and responds much as Twersky himself might have done in similar situations. The novel follows the life of Noah from his appointment as American consul in Tunis to the disappointment of the Ararat plan, but the events are all part of a slow process of inspiration and reflection by which Noah comes to the conclusion that the only hope for the Jewish people is in the Land of Israel. This is novelis tically problematic in that all of Noah's experiences become mere preludes to or diversions from his arrival at this central truth, thus necessitating the sentimental subplot of Miriam. Though the character lacks presence, his ideological journey nevertheless holds interest. The novel is constituted by the repeated posing of questions: What is the place of the Jew in America? Does America constitute a departure in the history of Diaspora? Is America a true home for the Jew? If not, then where? The novel concludes by demanding the choice of the Land of Israel. Yet this is presented as a difficult and painful choice, made reluctantly at the culmina tion of a long process. Indeed, Twersky's novel, with the exception of its final sec tions, is saturated with tremendous enthusiasm for the United States. It seems no accident that Twersky translated Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America into Hebrew. America, Twersky seems to argue in the novel, is truly different? different, at least, from Europe. Although it is not devoid of antisemitism, America is a noble and often wildly successful experiment in tolerance and inclusiveness, instaurating ideals of liberty, creativity, and security that have so 65.

Thomas Jefferson becomes one of many mouth pieces in the novel for these sentiments, describing how, during a sojourn in Europe, he gained an appreciation for the United States: How I began suddenly to miss this land, her soil, her climate, the equality here, the freedom, her laws, her people, her way of life. By God! How few citizens of my country realize how they have been blessed with blessings unlike those of any other nation or tongue. I must confess that it was only there in Europe that I myself began really to understand what I had understood before only in the abstract.66 "Europe is too much immersed in her memories," Jefferson argues to Tonneville, an anti-American French diplomat, whereas in America, "the future is more precious than the past." "Is there no past in America?" Tonneville challenges. Jefferson responds, "Certainly, monsieur, certainly! In 1776,1 proposed that the seal of our nation would show on one side the Israelites in the wilderness?a column of smoke leading them by day and a column of fire by night?and on the other side our Saxon ancestors, from whom we inherited the principles of our government and its forms." "Does my lord believe that the Americans are a chosen people? "Yes, monsieur Tonneville. I believe that this people is chosen by Providence just as the Children of Israel in their time, to give freedom and common sense to the world ... To be a second land of Canaan for all the refugees from Egypt in our day!"67 Here, Twersky emphasizes America's freedom from the past, which, in the context of the novel, implies a freedom from European antisemitism. He similarly empha sizes the extent to which America models its sense of national mission and unique ness on the Jewish nation: a marriage of the Emersonian and the Puritan, in each case with favorable Jewish resonance. In another scene, Noah's future father-in law is surprised that Noah, a Jew, could be the American ambassador to Tunis. Miriam responds, "That's the new world, father!"68 Twersky's Noah visits a Spain in which the Inquisition is still active, but America is a place where he grows up with American naval hero Steven Decatur as a playmate, emphasizing the integration of Jews and non-Jews in the United States. Twersky shows the appreciation that Hebraists felt for America, as against Europe, particularly in the aftermath of the Holocaust. One of the most striking ways in which the novel indicates its Americanness is by tracing the origin of the Ararat plan to that quintessential^ New World religion, the Church of Latter-Day Saints. Though some scholars have suggested 66. Ibid., 233. 67. Ibid., 233-34. 68. Ibid., 128. 96</page><page sequence="23">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge that Joseph Smith may have been inspired to launch his quest for an American Zion by the example of Mordecai Noah, whose Ararat plan Smith would have heard about growing up in upstate New York, Twersky reverses the direction of this influ ence, having Noah derive his Ararat idea from Smith. Although the idea of a Jewish state or place of refuge is foreshadowed throughout the novel, Noah first articulates the Ararat plan following a chance encounter with the fifteen-year-old Smith. Smith tells Noah that he converses with God, Jesus, and the prophet Mormon, and prophecies his own discovery of the golden tablets of Mormon scripture. Noah, who in real life condemned the persecution of Mormons, here cautions the boy that people will attack him for his outlandish ideas, but Smith responds determinedly, "Perhaps they will. But America is large, and in time we will find a place to establish a new state ... our Zion!"69 "Why not establish a state-settle ment for [the Jews] here in America?" thinks Noah afterward, deciding to under take the idea.70 Twersky performs a neat trick in this historical genealogy, connecting Noah's Jewish national idea with an American source, yet a source that is, in turn, inspired by the example of Jewish national destiny?similar to Twersky's reference, noted earlier, to the proposed seal of the United States that showed the biblical exodus, linking the American and Jewish nations.71 And yet, although the Mormon project of creating a Zion in America may be successful, Twersky's novel is unambiguous in its conviction that the Ararat project is a failure, that the Jewish national idea can only be realized in the Land of Israel. Even during the height of his enthusiasm for the plan, Twersky's Noah is insistent that his American colony is only a temporary "refuge," a necess ary preparation for the long-term goal of returning to Zion.72 Given the enthusiasm and appreciation for America manifest in the novel, how does Twersky justify his rejection of it? There are two main rationales for this rejection, both of which come to the fore in the final quarter of the novel and represent some of the novel's most anachronistic registers, clear intrusions of twentieth-century perspectives into the early nineteenth century. The first such rationale is the concern that America will fail to live up to its ideals, the main manifestations of this failure being slavery and racism. This is ironic, as the historical Noah, though often sympathetic to persecuted groups, became a staunch supporter of southern slavery toward the end of his life. In Twersky's novel, however, he is presented as particularly concerned about the treatment of blacks.73 And throughout the novel, Twersky questions America's 69. Ibid., 241. 70. Ibid., 242. 71. The connection between the Mormons and both ancient Israelite and modern Zionist history is made in a long narrative poem by another of the American Hebraists.

In Alfred Henry Lewis's Peggy O'Neal, Noah similarly stands unambiguously in his con viction that "slavery should be stricken down" (457). Lewis and Twersky both seem to have associated Noah with the progressive and liberal currents, respectively, in their own day.

Almost immedi ately after Jefferson delivers his speech about American exceptionalism, he learns that his own nephew has murdered a black slave. The news horrifies him and causes him to question the entire American project: "He believed so much in America, in the equality that existed here ... and his own flesh and blood?a mur derer of negroes!"74 This concern over the poison of racism raises the possibility that America is not, ultimately, different from Europe and that antisemitism will flourish in the New World as it has in the old. In his sorrow, Jefferson remembers the correspondence he once had with Noah concerning the place of the Jews in America, and now he doubts his own earlier confidence in American enlighten ment liberalism as a solution to the problems of the Jews. Is America really differ ent, he wonders? The Inquisition, reflects Jefferson, "is also here, in the new world, the land of tomorrow. Here too glowers the thirst for revenge, awaiting a slogan and a leader. Especially in the south." Jefferson's gloomy meditations clearly anticipate the Civil War, but they also indicate the extent to which Twersky's novel reflects the author's mid-twentieth-century perspective on America. At the dawn of the U.S. civil rights struggle, Twersky wonders what the outcome will be. And in the wake of the Holocaust, he wonders whether "enlightenment alone is sufficient" to withstand the poisonous hatreds that have dominated Europe and to make the United States an enduring exception to the Jewish Diaspora experience.75 However, the threat of antisemitism in the United States is not the primary novelistic rationale for the rejection of America. Twersky is too convinced of America's crucial differences from Europe to base his rejection on such fears. "And will they slander us here too, and say that we poison wells?" asks Noah. "No," he affirms, "there is also a different America that, like Benjamin Franklin, seeks to pull lightning from the heavens and the rod from the tyrant's hand."76 In the end, Twersky's most serious concern with America is not persecution but assimilation, not that enlightenment will fail in America but that it will succeed all too well. America is a melting pot, Twersky's Noah observes. It "swallows the uniqueness of peoples and turns them all into one new people."77 And there fore, as he proclaims at the novel's conclusion, it must be rejected despite the indisputable physical security it offers: I am certain: in the shade of the American flag millions of our kinsmen will find safety, yet we must not look for our messiah here, but rather in the land that is ours, the land given us as our portion of the world, and which we cannot lose without our people also losing its hopes to live as a people among peoples! Noah's Zionist argument is not that America will persecute its Jews but that a full Jewish national life cannot be lived in Diaspora: "No, in America our people will 74.

Only in the land of our fathers can it dare to be what it tmly is."78 Twersky reinforces these ideological conclusions with a series of abrupt and anachronistic introductions of twentieth-century American Jewish sociology into the novel, especially the figure an integrationist Reform rabbi, who presides over a materialistic and desultory bar mitzvah celebration that apparently is intended to show the hollowness of American Judaism. Unlike Sackler's Rabbi Peixotto, Twersky's Rabbi Morgenstern does not oppose the Ararat plan on traditionalist but on Americanist grounds. The plan, he argues, threatens all the benefits of American integration, offering Jews not "a state of our own, but a new ghetto."79 In a speech that is clearly meant to take on dark irony in the wake of the Holocaust, Morgenstern argues that the Jewish future will be secure only if it is based on an enlightenment integrationist outlook, and that Noah's nationalism is a dangerous atavism, soon to be forgotten. And yet the bar mitzvah boy, Sidney, a figure for the assimilation of the American-bom generation, rebels against his bar mitzvah lessons and is dismissive of Judaism and his immigrant tutors. The anachronisms multiply: Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, an Americanized and nouveau riche Jewish woman obsessed with her mink coats, the American bom child disdainful of the immigrant "greenhorn."80 As we see, Twersky's novel is not, ultimately, a meditation on Mordecai Noah and Jewish life in early nineteenth-century America but on Jewish life in mid-twentieth-century America. The novel answers the question of why Twersky himself would leave the United States in 1947, at the beginning of Amer ica's great postwar affluence, and move to the beleaguered Jewish protostate in Palestine. To answer this question, Twersky portrays an American Jewry that is more or less physically secure and financially prosperous but spiritually shallow and complacent, unwilling to consider the fragility of enlightenment liberalism as a guarantor of Jewish security or its inadequacy as a guarantor of Jewish national vitality. * * * Sackler and Twersky come to opposite conclusions about the consequences of Jewish national commitment for American Jews. Yet for all their differences, they speak the same language, both literally and ideologically. Both writers assume the need for a thriving national dimension to Jewish identity that is distinct from American identity, even if it is (at best) complementary or (at worst) contra dictory. Both see the Jewish national revival in the Land of Israel as, if not the cul mination of Jewish history (as in the case of Twersky), at the very least a central concern (as in the case of Sackler). In the case of the two most recent imaginative explorations of Noah and his Ararat plan, the authors are worlds apart, not only in terms of language?one 78. Ibid., 297. 79. Ibid., 264. 80. Ibid., 272. 99</page><page sequence="26">Michael Weingrad writes in English, the other in Hebrew?but in their basic stance toward Jewish identity and the significance of Noah for it. Both authors explore the archeology, fault lines, and nature of Jewish identity, but they are little in agreement as to what this identity is or whether it even exists. Ben Katchor's graphic novel The Jew of New York (1998, first serialized in the Forward in the early 1990s) is a meditation on American Jewish identity, set in the period immediately following the Ararat episode (1830). Noah is not one of the novel's main protagonists; instead, he makes appearances throughout as a back ground figure, yet he is central in that his presence helps to tie the loosely, often accidentally related strands of the story together. Like Zangwill and Twersky before him, Katchor imagines Jews who come to settle in Ararat, only to be disappointed when the plan is not realized. Unlike these Zionist writers, however, Katchor is enchanted with marginal Jewishness, with Jewishness as mar ginality, obscurity, the faint traces of immigrant Jewishness that are discernible at the margins of mainstream culture or blended almost indistinguishably into its center. He displays this affection for a kind of esoteric archeology of vanishing ethnic Jewishness in his "Julius Knipl" comic strips, which have appeared in the English-language Forward and other newspapers and are devoted to a subter ranean history of the denizens of New York's garment district and other aging Willy Loman-like figures, mining the blandest of urban landscapes for signifi cance in a manner that recalls the essays of Walter Benjamin. These strips have been justly praised for capturing a certain poignant lugubriousness that seems (at least to many of us who do not work in manufacturing or sales) to attach itself to obscure and mundane physical objects, such as newspaper weights, paper placemats, flagpole ornaments, and ball bearings?and their salesmen? moldering quietly throughout the aging eastern cities of the United States. Katchor himself is a red diaper baby?his father was a Jewish communist from Warsaw?and he has made out very well indeed for a comic book artist. He has been lionized by the New York Times and the New Yorker, has received Guggenheim and Mac Arthur "Genius" grants, and has even been the subject of a documentary film.81 The vision of American Jewish identity that is discernible in the "Julius Knipl" strips is thrown into sharper focus in Katchor's Noah book, which shows and even seems to celebrate the centrifugal forces pulling Jews away from organized community and traditional observance into the wilder, more hybrid domain of American society, whether in the city or on the frontier. The main thrust of Katchor's book is to cast doubt on all "authentic" or "original" forms of Jewish identity and, by extension, to render suspect forms of Jewish com munity or belonging that depend on rigid boundaries and definitions of what is and is not Jewish. This happens in myriad ways throughout the novel: discussions of the importance of Jewish continuity take place over oysters, while kabbalistic dia grams inspire French fabric patterns of haute couture. Interconnected with this 81.

The Jew of New York commences, therefore, with the preproduction of a play titled "The Jew of New York," which is a grotesque and antisemitic satire of Mordecai Manuel Noah, who is presented in the play as a decrepit Shylock with a "ghetto stoop"?all of which announces these themes of theatricality, representation, stereotypes, and authenticity, in connection with Jewish identity.82 Similarly, in the opening pages, another Jewish character, Nathan Kishon, found sprawled out under a bedsheet in a town square, is mistaken for "a naked Indian" by the trader Isaac Azarael, reminding Azarael, in turn, of a lecture he once heard claiming that American Indians are members of the Lost Tribes.83 Again, mistaken identity and dubious origins are the touchstone. Kishon, meanwhile, continues the theme of the authentic versus the bogus: We discover that he is a Jewish ritual slaughterer who has been found guilty of passing off nonkosher meat as ritually proper. In one of the most representative episodes, occurring midway into the book, the authenticity of both Holy Land and American origins are exploded. The arrival in New York of Enoch Letushim, a messenger selling dirt from the Holy Land, produces a seven-panel sequence of scenes from "the crooked streets of Jerusalem and its environs ... where unscmpulous guides" point out to "credulous pilgrims" where the events of the biblical narratives occurred.84 "All these places are described as the tme and genuine places where the events actually took place in the times referred to," says the narrator, quoting Chateaubriand's early nineteenth-century travel guide to the Holy Land, "though it is well known that even Jerusalem itself does not stand on the same spot of ground which it occupied in the time of Christ." There is, in this view, no way of ever really arriving at the "tme" City of David, let alone other sites, and those who think they do are simply allowing themselves to be gulled. Yet Letushim is curious to know whether, by contrast, an authoritative history of American places can be determined, and so he turns to a Native American whom he sees in a hotel lobby to ask what stood on the site of the hotel before the arrival of the whites. "I've only been here a few days," apologizes the Indian, "I come from Buffalo."85 No voice of native truth is to be found here. In fact, Letushim discovers that this Indian is in cahoots with an itinerant Jewish Hebrew teacher, and he recites Hebrew prayers, biblical passages, and sabbath hymns, to the amazement of paying audiences, who are told that he is "a rare, living member of one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel ... rescued from the wilds of upper New York state." Not only is the Holy Land a fake and a scam, then; aboriginal America is, too. There is apparently not much sympathy here for fixed or supposedly auth entic forms of identity. It is not only that we encounter no authentic or stable 82. Ben Katchor, The Jew of New York: A Historical Romance (New York: Pantheon, 1998), 4. 83. Ibid., 3. 84. Ibid., 47. 85.

We also hear the most forthright plea for clearly defined categories of authentic Jewishness from the most anti-Jewish character: Dr. Solidus, the author of the play "The Jew of New York," introduced as "a pamphleteer of anti-Semitic sentiments."86 Solidus complains, "Here in America, through assimilation and intermarriage, I fear that someday all of these [Jewish] traits will become diffused within the general popu lation?and in that, the real danger lies! There will be no Jews left, as I know them, to write about."87 It is the antis?mite, then, who is most upset about the fluidity of Jewish identity, particularly in the United States. Noah, on the other hand, criticizes Solidus's play because of its stock characters, warning the playwright that an American audience will not find these predictable stereotypes believable. The point is elaborated further when Vervel Kunzo, a rather improbable New York fieldworker for the Verein f?r Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden, observes, "The Jew is not a museum specimen to be admired on Sunday afternoons. Like all social beings he is subject to constant change and development?a creature of his surroundings."88 And indeed, the fate of the one Jew who literally becomes "a museum speci men" seems to be an allegory for the danger of attempting to fix authentic forms of identity rather than acknowledging its inherent randomness and malleability. When Kishon, who wants to join the Ararat colony, discovers that Noah has made no pro vision for any settlement, he is taken in by a fur trader named Moishe Ketzelbourd, "a baptised Jew who had lived for so many years in the wild that he no longer main tained any religious affiliation."89 In many ways, Ketzelbourd is the book's central character in that he epitomizes the Jew beyond identity, the Jew in the American wilderness who becomes increasingly inscrutable and undefmable. As Kishon spends more and more time traveling through the American wilderness with Ketzelbourd, his own traditional Jewish observances erode. Yet at the end of the book, the mentally unstable Ketzelbourd is shot and, because no one knows quite what to make of this bestial woodsman, his body is stuffed and mounted under glass for exhibition. "It is a creature unlike any I have seen before?defies classification!" claims an amateur zoologist.90 Kishon, meanwhile, is "recivilized" by the members of the organized Jewish community, who provide him with proper clothing and an eligible bachelorerte for marriage in order to avoid scandal and to reaffirm the boundaries of identity and decorum. Given such object lessons in the heavy, even murderous hand of identity cat egories and community boundaries, it is perhaps unsurprising that Katchor's 86. Ibid., 64. Solidus's acceptance of the term "antis?mite" is one of the many anachronisms in the book: The term was not coined until the 1870s. Nevertheless, Katchor does not pretend to be engaged in a rigidly faithful historical reconstruction; "the dreams of an amateur historian" (Wechsler, "A Wanderer in the Perfect City," 66) is how he has described his work. His Julius Knipl strips are similarly infused with imaginative, often surreal embellishment. 87. Katchor, The Jew of New York, 68. 88. Ibid., 85. 89. Ibid., 11. 90. Ibid., 84. 102</page><page sequence="29">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge treatment of Noah's Ararat plan is somewhat acid and dismissive and that Zionist and Jewish national themes are either absent or similarly disregarded. Of course, Katchor's vision of early nineteenth-century America as a whole comes across as a rather joyless landscape populated by lonely, obsessive eccentrics?intentions to the contrary are not helped by his relentlessly unlovely, grey-washed panels. Many of the plotlines are faintly whimsical at best and sometimes seem driven primarily by low and leaden humor, as in the case of the kabbalist whose mysti cism is based on the transcription of the sounds of eating into English letters and who thereby ascends to the mystical state of "greps" (Yiddish for belch), or the entrepreneur who wants people to invest in his plan to carbonate Lake Erie. Noah's Ararat is enfolded into these kinds of pointless follies and suspected of being "nothing more than a land speculation scheme."91 Katchor further imagines the insulted response of the Indians, who reject Noah's invitation to Ararat and who "cannot be subsumed by Major Noah's tribe of Jews" and "understandably expect trickery and deceit."92 If there is a Zionist or Jewish national resonance to Katchor's treatment of Noah, it is not a particularly positive one. But, as we have seen, The Jew of New York casts doubt on the very existence of a stable or collective Jewish identity, let alone one that might attain a destiny of any grandeur or brightness. * * * The obscurity into which Noah and his Ararat fall is a recurring theme in the literary representations of Noah. Katchor, of course, seems to thrive on the experi ence of oblivion, his comic strips conjuring a secular tradition of urban esot?rica to which he assimilates Noah. The narrator of Lewis's Peggy O'Neal blames the eclipse of Noah's fame partly on antisemitism, concluding that Noah's "modesty, coupled with that vulgar dislike of Jews by ones who might otherwise have named him in the annals ofthat day, has operated to obscure his name."93 Sackler lays the blame for the failure to preserve Noah's memory on his coreligionists. The third act of Sackler's play opens with the soliloquy of the engraver Seth Chapin as he works to prepare the foundation stone for Ararat: They say that the Jews' power of memory is great, and that they remember their friends no less than their enemies. If this is true, then my name will be eternally remembered. Certainly the Jews will not forget the first person to make something concrete for their republic ... Congratulations, Seth! You've already found your place in the history books!... All my life I've carved sweet, little lies to honor the deceased. (Pauses) Can it be that the foun dation stone of Ararat is also a sweet, little lie? I wonder! What will history make of the matter?94 91. Ibid., 12. 92. Ibid., 15. 93. Lewis, Peggy O'Neal, 72. 94. Sackler, Sefer hamahazot, 306. 103</page><page sequence="30">Michael Weingrad The irony is clear here, as Noah (let alone the engraver of the Ararat stone) was relegated to the dimmest part of American Jewish memory, and the foundation stone itself was forgotten for generations. As Sackler wrote later, when the play was in its Yiddish stage production in New York, "one of the leaders of the Zionist movement in America" approached him during the intermission and "asked me wonderingly if the comedy's protagonist was a historical figure or if I had invented the entire Ararat episode from whole cloth."95 And in Nava Semel's novel 1-yisra 'el, one of the characters also reflects on an almost entirely forgotten "half-mad playwright... who dreamed up the dizzy idea of establishing a state for the Jews" yet "whose name no one knows today."96 In Semel's novel, however, the reference is not to Noah but to Theodor Herzl. In the alternate universe of 1-yisra 'el, Herzl has died in obscurity. Noah, on the other hand, successfully established his city of refuge, which, in the year 2001 of this alternative timestream, has existed successfully both as a Jewish state and a member of the American republic for 176 years. Other authors?Zang will, Twersky, and Katchor?have imagined what might have happened had one or two Jews actually responded to Noah's call. But no one, not even Katchor, has endeavored novelistically to imagine what Jewish history and Jewish identity might be like today had the persecuted Jews of the world come to live on Grand Island in the state of New York. This is the novelty of Semel's cleverly inventive, thought-provoking, and deeply touching book?her m?i-Altneuland, as it were. Semel's novel, the fifth by this prolific writer (also a children's author, jour nalist, critic, and member of the board of governors of Yad Vashem), is a medita tion on Jewish and Israeli identity as they connect with homeland, refuge, and physical and spiritual survival. Like Katchor, Semel also wants to know whether there is such a thing as Jewish identity and what it consists of. Yet the contrast between these two latter-day Noah books could not be greater. Unlike Katchor, Semel is convinced that there is such a thing as Jewish identity and that it is deeply and complexly intertwined with what it means to be Israeli. As one of the non-Jewish characters in the novel asks himself, "What kind of Jews are these Israelis?"97 Or, as we might elaborate the question, which Semel does novelistically, would a different history?one without the state of Israel and with a Diasporic yet physically secure, territorial Jewish existence?create a different Jewish people? Is Israeliness, therefore, an accident, something not intrinsically connected with Jewishness? Would Diaspora itself mean something different under such circumstances? What is the Jewishness that inheres in Israeli ness and that can maintain its commonality even in such an alternate history? To begin to answer these questions, Semel conducts an experiment, using her parallel universe as an imaginative control group, as it were, for the Jewish people, dis mantling Israel and Israeli Jewishness in order to see what remains, to discover the common Jewish substrates. Semel's purpose is not didactic but observational: 95. Sackler, Sofpasuk, 22. 96. Nava Semel, 'I-yisra 'el (Tel Aviv: Yediot Aharonot, 2005), 265. 97. Ibid., 36. 104</page><page sequence="31">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge One does not conclude the novel with a final, articulated definition of Jewishness. Yet neither does her exercise in historical deconstmction seem to me an anti Zionist exercise in wiping clean the Jewish slate (state). By imagining the absence of Israel?this is the wordplay of the novel's title, which can mean both Isra-Island (the name given to Noah's state in the alternative universe) and Not-Israel?Semel approaches more profoundly what her country is and means.98 This exercise is the last of a three-part novel. In the first part, which takes place in September 2001 of our own universe, Semel imagines an Israeli descen dent of Noah discovering his forebear's title deed to Grand Island and mnning off to see what is now a bedroom community of Buffalo, New York. The episode allows the non-Jewish police detective, asked by the Israeli consulate to locate their missing citizen, to pose questions about Jews, about Israel, and about Jewish and Israeli identity as he attempts to track down the Israeli. The second part takes place in September 1825, the week before the inauguration ceremony for Ararat. Here, Semel imagines Noah visiting Grand Island in the company of a Native American girl, the last native inhabitant of the island. This middle section is understood to be the pivot of the novel: The decisions of the two char acters, Noah and Little Dove, determine whether history arrives at the events of part one, in our own universe, or part three, which takes place in September 2001 of this alternate timestream. Similar characters, themes, and situations crop up in all three sections, their variations creating sometimes uncanny effects. Most striking, perhaps, is the focus on Native Americans as Jewish paral lels, a motif that returns us to Zangwill's story and to the American Hebraists' fre quent, if implicit, comparisons of Jews and Indians. The detective of part one is of Native American descent, but he is in flight from his ethnic roots and keeps up a mnning mental dialogue with his deceased Native American grandmother, who becomes increasingly intertwined in his head with the deceased Jewish father of Noah's Israeli descendent. The second part rests on the encounter between Noah and Little Dove during the course of what is to be her last night on her people's island. And the Jewish state of part three is, we discover, a fusion of Jewish and Native American culture, exemplified by the state flag (a magen David above elm leaves) and bar mitzvah ceremonies modelled on Native American vision quests. Historically?if that is the word one uses when referring to the alternative history of part three?the consequences of Noah's success in establishing his Jewish state are enormous. As noted, the state of Israel never came into existence. (The Middle East is described by one character as a sleepy and boring region, never in the news.) Moreover, according to the logic of the novel, the presence of Noah's Jewish state not only means the nonexistence of Israel, it also means the nonoccurrence of the other major event of modem Jewish history, the Holo caust. Although in this alternate history, the Nazis were able to vent their hatred 98.1 want to thank Nava Semel for our brief but enjoyable correspondence about her novel and to mention that 'I-yisra 'el is to be the basis of a new Israeli documentary about Noah's Ararat, featuring Ben Katchor as well. 105</page><page sequence="32">Michael Weingrad on gypsies, homosexuals, political dissidents, and the disabled, the Jews of Europe were able to leave and come to the United States because they were admitted into the Jewish refuge of T-yisra'el. Indeed, Noah's impulse for creating his Jewish refuge is, as Semel indicates in the first two sections of the novel, his quasi-pro phetic fear of the Holocaust, about which he has nightmares in part two and to which he alludes in the title deed that resurfaces in part one. Far more than Twers ky's or Katchor's books, Semel's novel presents us with a post-Holocaust Noah, his name alluding to the most horrific deluge in Jewish history. The nonoccurrence of the Holocaust in part three is at least as central to the logic and effect of the novel?its ability to ponder the nature of modem Jewish identity?as the nonexis tence of the state of Israel. Given these vast historical differences, one is struck by the continuities and similarities that remain. Normalcy continues to elude Jewish existence, which, even in its T-yisra'eli form, is marked by unease, exile, and difference. Noah's uto pianism has had considerable success in providing a refuge for Jews, but only on the small space of Grand Island. Antisemitism still exists. Violent hatred yet stalks the earth?both the first and third parts of the novel are punctuated by the mass murder of 9/11?and Jews are still seen as outsiders in the world beyond T-yisra'el. There is no Arab-Israeli conflict in this alternate universe, yet the Jewish possession of Grand Island, which was formerly Native American territory, is not uncontested either, suggesting that when people refuse to grant refuge to those in need, only hatred can result. Throughout all of this, the question of how the state of Israel is and is not reflected in T-yisra'el is constant. Liam Emmanuel, the descendent of Noah in part one, insists that the differences are fundamental: "in contrast to Grand Island, Liam Emmanuel explained ... Israel was from the beginning the place of [the Jews'] heart's desire, from which they had been forcibly uprooted."99 Yet the novel incessantly works over the motif and implications of the refuge?often using the Yiddish term boydem (attic), a tiny hiding place?posing the question of whether the state of Israel is also a kind of boydem for the Jews. What, Semel asks, is the difference between homeland and refuge, state and boydem? The method of the novel is the intricate working and reworking of its themes, often highlighted by ironic variations of biblical quotations now fit to a world without Zionism and Israel, a world in which refuge and not return?miklat zion, not shivat zion?is the modem Jewish collective call. The three parts are not wholly separate but uncanny repetitions of the same encounters and events in new clothes, reading like a sestina in prose. The novel also has its limitations and flaws. Some characters are drawn either as ciphers or as stereotypes: Native Amer ican themes in particular, being so central to the novel, are sometimes deployed with delightful surprise but sometimes with stale convention. Little Dove of part two, for example, is a recycled Pocahontas, the melancholy but dutiful princess of the dying tribe. And, perhaps intentionally, there is no overt consideration of American Jewry as having positive value or culture in its own right. Instead, American motifs circle around Indians, New York City, Ararat/Grand Island/T-yisra'el and the legacies of 99. Semel, 1-yisra'el, 113. 106</page><page sequence="33">Mordecai Manuel Noah and the American Refuge oppression, racism, and slavery. If T-yisra'el is an opportunity for Semel to consider the absence of Israel, it does not seem to require a consideration of the absence of an American Jewry as we know it today.100 Semel's novel is very evidently intended as an imaginative provocation to the Zionist narrative and the Arab-Israeli conflict, a reimagining of what Jewish life might be had the Native (here the American Indian, but acting to some extent as a stand-in for the Palestinian Arab) and the Jew come to more peaceful terms?that is, had the yearning for homeland and refuge been a source not of div ision but of fusion. Nevertheless, 1-yisra 'el implicitly reaffirms the positive sig nificance of Zionism and its achievements. The stakes of the novel rest on how we read the conclusion to the third part, which, without giving too much of the novel away, involves a replay of the 9/11 attack that heartbreakingly closes the first part. Neither ending reduces to ideological allegory, yet both operate through the poignant juxtaposition of individual loss and collective fate. As we leave the grieving lover of the first part in lower Manhattan, adding another "Have you seen ... ?" flyer to those tragic collages, the surviving member of the couple in part three wanders "the shoreline between Jaffa and Gaza"101? that is, the space of Israel's absence. This latter shiva is Semel's final unraveling of the state of Israel, the elimination of the collective and the national, its territory entirely individual: Even the Arab woman who joins in the bereaved lover's kaddish prayer is absent in the final line. The Land of Israel is now a random shoreline, given meaning only momentarily through the mourning gesture of the character and?for the reader?the ironic knowledge of what is missing. It may be that I am reimposing on the book precisely the Zionist narrative that Semel has sought to set aside, yet I do not think it accidental that the main differ ence between the conclusion of part three and part one in this regard is that part one (like part two) ends with a child in the picture. However hopeful and moving, part three offers no such procreative continuation. The alternate reality of part three, of Noah's 'I-yisra 'el, is therefore reflected in this final reduction to the individual, without nation, without peoplehood, without future. And yet this is the nature of alternate histories, which are inherently sad. They posit the stillbirth of the reality we know and haunt us with the extinction of lives that might have been. * * * One evening not long after the establishment of the state of Israel, Harry Sackler recounts in his quirky little story "Major Noah Breaks Out of His 100. Interestingly, Semel has explained that she began to create fiction when, as a girl, she had the responsibility for accompanying her then-blind grandfather on walks. Her grandfather, an inveterate anti-Zionist who would have preferred to live in the United States, constantly denigrated anything in Tel Aviv his granddaughter described to him, declaring it less impressive than what he had known in New York City. In response, the young Semel began to embellish and exaggerate the urban wonders of Tel Aviv to her blind grandfather so that what she described might compare more favorably to America. 101. Semel, 1-yisra'el, 273. 107</page><page sequence="34">Michael Weingrad Frame," Mordecai Manuel Noah stepped out of the portrait hanging in Sackler's study and began to complain to his fellow dramatist and Jewish activist. Now that the Jewish state had become a reality, Noah felt slighted that his role in launch ing modern Jewish nationalism was being ignored. Shouldn't this American visionary get some credit for the state of Israel? And Sackler, accused Noah, had helped to undermine Noah's reputation with his play, which focused with excessive levity entirely on the Ararat plan, to the exclusion of Noah's later espou sal of a thoroughly Palestinocentric proto-Zionism. He now demanded that Sackler make atonement by writing a new play, rehabilitating Noah in the history of modern Jewish nationalism and producing it in Israel so that all would know "that the seed of political Zionism was sown in New York."102 It would seem that, so long as the meaning of the Jewish state, of America and its promise for the Jews, and of Jewish identity itself are in question, Noah will from time to time break out of his frame, rediscovered and reimagined for new times and contexts by new writers. We have seen Howells's Noah, an emblem of the ambivalent power of American romanticism; Zangwill's Noah, a doubtful Herzl and object of desperate Zionist hope; Lewis's Noah, exemplar of the patri otism and excellence of American Jewry. In works by Sackler and Twersky, we have seen Noah as the American Hebraist voices of acceptance and rejection of the Jewish place in the United States. And, in recent years, we have seen Noah and his Ararat plan smouldering among the embers of ethnic consciousness in Katchor's graphic novel and resurrected in Semel's imaginative dismantling of modern Jewish history in order to find the ding an sich of Jewishness and to reaf firm Israel's connection with Jewish and human destiny. Like other Jewish messiah figures, from Jesus to Shabbetai Zvi, Noah compels the imagination, yet he does so in an American context all his own. For Sackler, however, this was not the time to take Noah on the road and thrust him again into Jewish consciousness. Now that the Jewish state was a reality, disappointingly imperfect and unpredictably alive, Sackler decided to remain in the United States. America, he indicated, was indeed a refuge: a refuge for Utopians and romantics who preferred to dream of Zion rather than contend with its reality. "Here in America," he replies to Noah, "it is still possible for old Zionists who are not men of action to sit in a quiet corner and preserve the romantic spark hidden in their heart."103 And with that, Noah resumed his place in the picture on the wall.
