Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2005. 360 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407?00645 Since?and here the reader can provide the publication year of a seminal work, for example, Geoffrey Hartman and Sanford Buddick's Midrash and Litera ture in 1986?the study of midrash aggadah has undergone a profound transform ation. Whereas traditional readers engage Aggadah as a repository of religious instruction (which it often is) and earlier academic scholarship as a source of his torical information (which it almost never is), many contemporary readers focus on the sophisticated literary forms of Aggadah. Key issues in literary studies? intertexruality, dialogism, deconstruction, semiotics?have been integrated into the study of midrash and, occasionally, vice versa. The precise dating of the begin ning of this shift is, to be sure, open to debate, but there is no question that the literary investigation of Aggadah is now decades along. So there is something unsettling about Ha-sipur she-lo ' supar (referred to here as The Twice-Told Tale), Yehoshua Levinson's study of the poetics of midrash 'aggadah. Not because the topics covered are unfamiliar?to the contrary, Levinson addresses the core issues of aggadic narratology: the narrative devices used to construct the literary world of Aggadah, the role of the narrator in this process, the 379</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews implied reader constructed by the text, and more. What is unsettling is that, time and again, Levinson introduces these as terra heretofore incognita. "The car dinal question, albeit one that has almost never been raised, is, Whence does the midrashist draw the semantic material for his narrative?" (69).l "In order to con struct a typology of the midrashic narrative" (106; emphasis mine), "surprisingly, the nature and character of the narrator?in any of the narrative genres within rab binic literature?has yet to be studied" (151). "Within the study of midrash, the fate of the [implied] reader has been no kinder than that of the narrator" (192). In some cases, Levinson cites an article or two relevant to the topic, but these pre liminary efforts notwithstanding, it appears that some of the most fundamental questions in midrashic narrative have not been meaningfully addressed prior to The Twice-Told Tale. This alone is worth the price of admission. But Levinson, of course, is not interested in merely raising questions. Through a series of theoretically informed close readings, primarily of Bereshit Rabbah, The Twice-Told Tale goes a long way toward answering them. Levinson situates himself within the historicist approach to midrash, a purely interpretive one that understands the derashah as "merely" responding to problems in the bib lical text without recognizing the literary creation of the darshan. Some of these concerns are outdated or perhaps more acute in Israeli scho larly circles. Is it really necessary, in light of Jim Kugel's scholarly oeuvre, to argue that midrashim are truly interpretive? And how current is the image of the midrashist as a Romantic genius, using scriptural irregularities as a pretext for his own spontaneous creativity? But the end result is convincing: Midrash is auth entically interpretive but expresses its interpretive insights in a sophisticated employment of the literary language of the day. (As someone who works in midrash halakhah, it is interesting to me that the interpretive projects of the two disciplines are, in a sense, reversed. Midrash halakhah scholarship seeks to demon strate that there is a creative and literary element in legal midrash, whereas Levinson argues that there is something other than creativity?that is, an engage ment of and determination by the biblical text?in aggadic midrash). The result is a collection of close readings of midrash qua close reading of scripture. Levinson's close readings are at times fascinating, and he is at his best in the narratological analysis, for example, the role of the narrator in the formation of midrash. Levinson shows how the citation of biblical verses (as opposed to, for example, their reworking and integration in interpretive but nonmidrashic works such as Jubilees) emphasizes the open rabbinic appropriation of the verse that makes it into part of the midrashic text while recognizing that it remains part of the biblical text (171). Later in the same chapter (Chap. 4), Levinson examines the citation of monologues (spoken or thought) and shows in a brilliant analysis how the midrashist uses this technique to represent the dramatis persona s under standing of the events, thus forming an alliance of sorts between the narrator and the reader as they together examine the literary world created by the midrash. Another high point is Levinson's discussion of the range of techniques the 1. Translations from the book are my own. 380</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews midrash uses to create and "navigate" the implied reader, especially with regard to the latter's knowledge of the biblical story. At times, this knowledge is assumed and the derashah introduces new elements into the biblical story to renew the tension in a now familiar plot. Other times, the biblical figures are endowed by the derashah with a full understanding of the biblical text and thus are elevated to the level of the reader. In each case, different literary techniques are used and a different affective result is achieved. For all its strengths, the book is not without problems. Some are relatively minor. Levinson has a tendency to introduce theoretical models in almost an offhand way?psychoanalytic interpretation at pages 42-A4, Bakhtin's chronotope at pages 128 and 159?and, once they have served the local argument, they are not heard from again. Levinson also makes great demands of his reader both in the mid rashic and the theoretical discussions. I do not know what an "epicyclic" genre is (the Hebrew, ^p^DX, is not very helpful) and could have used a fuller gloss than Levinson provides. I also had to look up "PDIDO and fn?piKn in the midrashic citations, as Levinson does not provide glosses for these forms ("hunched over" and "officials in charge of slaves [actores publici]" respectively) but rather directs the reader to the relevant dictionaries. And apparently statements such as "every culture is, overall, a rhetorical form, a means of persuasion" (106) are to be accepted without (ironically) any attempt at persuasion on the part of the author. The shorthand that Levinson sometimes employs is particularly frustrating when it is attached to more central ideas. For example, Levinson argues that midrash, which transcribes the biblical drama in an internal or psychological key that plays out in the soul of the protagonist, reflects a new model of subjectiv ity (128-31). He also argues that the Babylonian Talmud reflects the appearance of narrative as an independent cultural category that carries its own authority, separ ate from revelation and interpretation (316-17). Both of these strike me as bold and perhaps revolutionary arguments, crying out for further investigation. Exhaus tive discussion of these arguments undoubtedly lies outside the purview of this book (i.e., is there not some interiorization already evident in 1QS 2.11, where the priests of the community curse the initiate "by the idols of his heart" ["0*7 ^ito TDK]? Or the prophetic teachings of circumcising the heart?). Still and all, it is unfair to dangle these tantalizing ideas in front of the reader and move on too quickly. In terms of its theoretical orientation, The Twice-Told Tale divides its alle giances between the structuralist sensibilities of folkloric interpretation and the historically robust contexrualizations of cultural studies. The transition between the two is not always smooth. Note, for example, the tension inherent in the title of Chapter 3, "Structural Analysis and Cultural Models," which yokes together two approaches that do not always coexist peacefully. Part of the appeal of structur alism, after all, is its rejection of (the primacy of) diachronic explanations and the assertion that the meaning of texts resides in their very structure; readers need no recourse to the broader context in which the text was created, be that the cultural context of the day (influence) or the life of the author (biography). This awkward juxtaposition plays out in the chapter itself, which includes a structurally informed typological analysis of "Narratives Concerning Borders and Border Crossings" 381</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews (134) alongside a comparative study of the theosebeis (God fearers) in Patristic lit erature and Mediterranean archaeology and the possible influence of this group on the development of a midrashic motif (142-48). The shift is jarring and reflects a deeper methodological issue concerning the use of these modes of analysis in a single argument. The Twice-Told Tale is a wonderful book, and the points of criticism I have voiced in this review are the result of a deep and intellectually satisfying engage ment with its arguments, which represent a significant step forward in our under standing of midrash aggadah.
