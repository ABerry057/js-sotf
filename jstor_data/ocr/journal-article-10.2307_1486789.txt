<plain_text><page sequence="1">Andrea Poma. The Critical Philosophy ofHermann Cohen. Translated by John Denton. New York: SUNY Press, 1997. xi, 320 pp. (Originally published as La Filosofia Critica di Hermann Cohen. Milano: Ugo Mursia Editore, 1988) Eleven years after its first publication in Italian, Andrea Poma's study on Hermann Cohen's critical philosophy is now available in English and it is the best comprehensive contemporary exposition of its topic available in this language to date. Of the various studies on Cohen's philosophy published in German and Italian since the 1970s, Poma's has been one of the best informed, most elegantly written, and least cumbersome, and Kenneth Seeskin, the editor of the SUNY series in Jewish Philosophy has done a real service to the community of readers in the Anglophone academy to have this volume translated and published. Both Jewish and general philosophical readers will welcome this concise introduction to an unjustifiably obscure thinker. Seeskin, Robert Gibbs, Norbert Samuelson, and quite a few other Jewish philosophers have been following the lead of the late Steven S. Schwarszschild in keeping alive interest in Hermann Cohen's work despite the almost pervasive verdict of perdition cast in Jewish and general philosophy on this late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century philosopher. They are now aided in their calls to return to Cohen by a movement among European philosophers (Helmut Holzhey in Zurich, Geert Edel in Hamburg, and Poma, Pierfrancesco Fiorato and Irene Kajon in Italy, to name just a few) which has produced a number of fine international conferences, numerous articles, and several monographs on various aspects of neo-Kantianism in general and of Hermann Cohen's philosophy in particular. This work of commentary and discussion accompanies the ongoing new edition of Cohen's</page><page sequence="2">442 BOOK REVIEWS works, published by Georg Olms (New York and Hildesheim, 1977ff), which runs to 17 volumes, including critical comparisons between various editions of Cohen's works, excellent introductions, and an integrated and annotated edition of the shorter Jewish, political, and philosophical writings. It is to be hoped that Anglophone interest in this branch of Continental philosophy will eventually gain enough momentum that a translation of this new edition will become feasible as well. Poma's introduction places Cohen in the context of the renewal of critical idealism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in reaction to a crisis of philosophy associated with the collapse of German idealism, followed by a rise in popularity of the empirical sciences and the challenge of philosophical materialism. Several studies are available in English that describe this crisis along with the rise of neo-Kantianism in its wake but Poma's is the only one to date that dedicates its effort not to a general philosophical and university historical phenomenon that can be described sociologically but rather th the development of Cohen's program of critical philosophy as an original contribution to the history of philosophy. He begins with the onset of Cohen's interest in Kant that leads him to the publication of the first of three works on Kant, Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (first edition 1871). Poma then describes Cohen's self-extrication from the then dominant psychological interpretation of the apriori through a series of studies on Plato that led Cohen to develop a critical philosophical program that is indebted to Plat no less than to Kant. In further problem-history studies, most importantly on the method of the infinitesimal calculus, Cohen revises his owh interpretation of Kant's philosophy, revealing a constructive rather than a historical interest and approach. Poma not only traces Cohen's path th eminence in early 20th-century European academic philosophy but competently introduces the reader to Cohen's program of critical idealism. After he clarifies this program in contrast to (Kant's) transcendental idealism, materialism, spiritualism, skepticisom, eudemonism, pantheism, and absolute idealism, Poma proceeds, following the structure of Cohen's philosophical system (published between 1902 and 1912), in chapters on Logic, Ethics, and Aesthetics, covering also the important aspect of the idea of a system of philosophy which is expressed in Cohen's concept of a "unity of the cultural consciousness." Finally Poma addressess the important and, as he puts it, "still open" question of the relation of the program of critical idealism to the "late" philosophy of religion to which he dedicates the four full chapters (about one third of the book). There is no room here for a detailed criticism. Suffice it to take a look</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 443 at the way Poma suggests to settle the discussion on the relation between Cohen's system of philosophy and his "late" philosophy of religion. Poma seeks a compromise between the positions taken by Franz Rosenzweig (and Siegfried S. Ucko) on the one hand and by Alexander Altmann (and Heinz M.Graupe) on the other. Following Altmann, he establishes continuity in Cohen's interest in the program of critical idealism, extending into his late philosophy of religion. Yet following Rosenzweig, he shows that the themes and ideas taken up in his "late" philosophy of religion force him to modify the contents of his critical philosophy in order to accomodate that which Logic and Ethics cannot address: the human being in his or her concreteness and subjectivity. This part of Poma's work shows the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the book as a whole. Poma is a fine reader if and when the text supports his thesis, but, like Rosenzweig, whose cues he follows a bit too unsuspectingly, he ignores the sources or reads them too superficially where they contradict his understanding of how Cohen's work and thought developed, certainly not a grave mistake in a book which, at the time of its composition, was a pioneering work of great scope. In his research Poma covered Cohen's printed works and he handles them well. Yet he fails to venture into documentary evidence of any sort or to look for deeper explanations for some of the major inconsistencies in Rosenzweig's account of Cohen's development from a critical philosopher to a pious Jew. While this weaker aspect of the book may have been acceptable in 1988, the English edition could have been revised to respond to more recent research which has significantly challenged the common understanding of the relation between Cohen's system and his philosophy of religion. Notwithstanding these shortcomings in the psychological and biographical department, the book deserves full endorsement as a guide to a maze of late 19th-century philosophical problems and intellectual struggles, and as an introduction to the critical philosophy of Hermann Cohen.
