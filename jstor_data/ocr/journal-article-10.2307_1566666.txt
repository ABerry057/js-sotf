Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. 283 pp. In 1921, a case was decided by the New York Court of Appeals that added to the fame of its chiefjudge, Benjamin Cardozo, who wrote the opinion for the court. Two cousins were riding on a train. One of them fell from the train, the doors of which had been left open, and the other jumped off to rescue him. The man who fell was killed; the would-be rescuer, injured, sued the railroad company for damages. The railroad defended itself by claiming that the plaintiff had acted as a volunteer and assumed the hazards of his action. Cardozo upheld the plaintiffs claim and stated that the company should have foreseen that "danger invites rescue."' Today, in some states, the plaintiff in a case of the same kind would have a legal duty to seek to help his cousin. Under Good Samaritan laws, danger not only invites but compels rescue. What was a moral duty has become a legal duty. The law has incorporated into itself the individual's moral conscience. So, too, to cite another example of this very interesting development in American law, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, disabled persons have a civil right not to be discriminated against because they are lame or blind or suffering from any other disability. By adoption of this law, Congress converted a moral duty into a legal duty. An employer need not consult his conscience but rather his lawyer regarding his obligations. 1. Wagner v. Intern.

Newman, professor of religion and director of the Judaic Studies Program at Carleton College, examines a similar phenomenon in Jewish moral and legal thought. The first chapter of his interesting, provocative book is entitled "Law, Virtue, and Supererogation in the Halakha: The Problem of Lifnim Mishurat Hadin Reconsidered." One of the most familiar passages in the liturgy for the morning service is the passage from the Mishnah (Peah, chap. 1) stating that among the things which have no fixed measure (i.e., by enactment of the law) are "the corners of the field, ... the practice of charity." In other words, after fulfilling what the law requires as to leaving the corners of his field for the poor, and the practice of charity, the owner may enlarge the portion of his field for the poor and increase the amount of his charity, acting lifnim mi-shurat ha-din, "beyond the line of the law." Newman quotes numerous examples from the Talmud that at least suggest the question of whether an action that is lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is really outside of the din or is required by the din. Does the Halakhah require a person to act as a Good Samaritan, or does it view such action as supererogatory? After a very careful analysis of the talmudic and biblical passages, Newman concludes that the issue cannot be conclusively resolved. "To be sure," he writes, "none of the sources speaks directly to the question at hand and, in the absence of direct statements concerning the status of such actions, we are left to draw inferences from the claims that are made" (p. 35). The end result is that some talmudic sources suggest that lifnim mi-shurat ha-din is obligatory and some suggest it is optional. Although the author's detailed investigation is inconclusive, it was eminently worth making. Similarly, Newman's examination of the diverse sources in classical Judaism on the question of whether there is a natural law doctrine in Judaism ends inconclusively, but his analysis of the texts and the arguments that they have generated is exceptional. He considers the contributions to the debate made by Leo Strauss, Marvin Fox, Josef Fuchs, Michael Levine, David Novak, Jos6 Faur, Douglas Knight, Steven Schwarzschild, Bernard S. Jackson, and J. David Bleich. Newman puts his own conclusion on the question modestly as a "suggestion." He sees the question of whether or not there is a belief in natural law in Judaism against the tension between revelation and creation, a tension which, he says, "precludes any simple pronouncements that Judaism either is or is not hospitable to natural law thinking. The fact that Israel stands in a unique relationship to God by virtue of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 131 divine revelation is balanced by a recognition that all humankind stands in relationship to God by virtue of divine creation" (p. 138). Newman's book is a rich storehouse of scholarship and independent thought on many important issues relating to Jewish ethics, including the fundamental question: What does it mean to speak of Jewish, as differentiated from universal, ethics? Past Imperatives is not a textbook, not a book for an introductory course on Jewish ethics; it is a book for accomplished scholars in Jewish thought, for fellow theologians and philosophers devoted to a study of Judaism in depth.
