Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004. xiv, 352 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000712 Gracefully written, magnificently researched, and profoundly significant, GUews: How World War II Changed a Generation, represents a book of singular distinction. Indeed, GUews may be the most impressive work of scholarship ever written about white ethnic Americans and World War II. Few topics have attracted as much scholarly and literary attention as World War II. Studies of the "Good War" and the "Best War Ever" line bookshelves as the veterans of that conflict die at the rate of more than a thousand each day. In films and television, World War II reveals few signs of slackening interest. As anyone who has ever watched the History Channel can testify, the American public has an unquenchable appetite for the siege of Stalingrad and the air cam paign over Europe. The home-front war has also engaged scholars' interests. Thousands of books have examined women, workers, the film industry, and state and local communities. Historians have been especially attentive to issues of race and war. Several fine books have addressed Hispanics, Native Americans, and topics such as the 1.

But inexplicably, scholars have largely ignored the impact of World War II on the "New Immigrants," the millions of southern, eastern, and central European immigrants who came to America between 1890 and 1920. Moreover, relatively little scholarship has addressed how the children of Jewish, Italian, Polish, Greek, and Slovak immigrants partici pated in or were affected by the war. Deborah Dash Moore, a professor of religion at Vassar College, has written a seminal book that should be a model for other ethnic groups to follow. In some respects, GI Jews is a prequel to her 1994 study, To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the Jewish Dream in Miami and Los Angeles (Harvard University Press). To be sure, Los Angeles and Miami boasted a Jewish presence before 1941, but World War II, more than any single event, exposed California and Florida to hun dreds of thousands of Jewish servicemen and women, as well as spouses, workers, and travelers. Moreover, the prosperity generated by the war and defense spending and leisure revolutions made Los Angeles and Miami dream cities in dream states. Moore understands fully that World War II introduced new levels and methods of regimentation, leveling, and blending. Millions of GIs ate the same food, wore the same khaki clothes, and participated in the same drills and classes. "The history of World War II, as experienced by American Jews," writes Moore, "is one of difference amid similarity, of exclusion amid integration, of transfiguration amid routine, of triumph and catastrophe" (21). To understand American Jews in the 1940s, argues Moore, one must appreciate the 1930s. The decade began with the worst depression in American history. Jewish immigrants and their highly urbanized, relatively well-educated, and Americanized children debated pacifism, Zionism, Stalinism, and the New Deal. September 1939 not only represented a new century in the Jewish calendar, but also it inaugurated a world war that altered (and destroyed) the lives of millions of Jews on five continents and culminated with the creation of a new nation state. Josef Stalin?who knew all too well?famously proclaimed that six million deaths is a statistic; one death is a tragedy. Moore understands the power of storytelling, and she balances the text beautifully between analysis and narrative. Calculating that half a million Jews served in the armed forces, Moore selects fifteen subjects to personalize the story. Her band of brothers includes Harold Freeman, a Brooklyn-bom GI who is also the author's father! Jewish GIs shared collective experiences, but Moore avoids sweeping gen eralizations. Stories of antisemitism and insensitivities abound. "Their story was haunted by anti-Semitism but not determined by it," Moore concludes, arguing that the process of Jewish differentiation was more complicated and complex. Jews, she believed, "would become fighters, master the technologies of war, learn to take orders, to lead, and to risk ... they simultaneously would fulfill a long-standing dream of Jewish radical movements to transform Jews into war riors." Perhaps most profoundly, "Judaism assumed an American legitimacy unan ticipated at the start of the war" (10). For American Jews, argues Moore, victory and the liberation of Europe eli cited joy but also a terrible toll. "Irrespective of a Jewish GI's self-identification, nothing prepared him for entering the concentration and death camps" (223). 400</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The Holocaust reinforced the point that the war in general and the death camps in particular made GI Jews feel more American and more Jewish.
