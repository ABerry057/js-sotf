Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell, 2004. 494 pp. In his preface to A History of the Holocaust, Saul Friedman states, Academics may be disappointed to find no great philosophy of history spun in these pages... . While developing this text my principal commitment has been to students, lay persons and other teachers who still need to understand basic facts before they graduate to a different level of Holocaust studies. Sadly, the shelf-life of good text-books [in English?] like those authored by Leon Poliakov [1951], Gerald Reitlinger [1953] and Nora Levin [1968] is rather short. My own book is offered as a synthesis of sources and issues, a primer in the study of genocide. (xii) This passage is, in my eyes, a key to some of the basic problems of this book. First, Friedman makes an assumption that there is such a thing as a history of raw ("basic") facts (of which a "text-book" can be written) versus a higher-level interpretive history and that the first is for the "uneducated" and the other for "professionals." This nineteenth-century belief has long been overridden, and any historian knows that without some conceptualization, it is impossible to sieve relevant facts from the infinite pile of information that the past provides us with.' Indeed, in spite of his statement, Friedman has some overarching con- cepts: (1) "Holocaust is the term applied to the Nazi scheme of genocide in Europe between 1933 and 1945"; (2) "only one group was to be eliminated wherever they were found-the Jews"; (3) the Holocaust was the culmination of age-old antisemitism, which has accompanied Jews throughout their history; and yet (4) "it was unique within the context of Jewish history" in that there was no way out-"all had to die" (x-xi). But having chosen this strategy of explanation (as the only one), Friedman disregards other explanations that have been suggested on the basis of a lot of (other) "basic facts"2 without even discussing or mentioning them. 1. Theoretical literature on this is legion; one should only consult the periodical History and Theory to be informed. 2. See Dan Michman, Holocaust Historiography: A Jewish Perspective: Conceptualizations, Terminology, Approaches, and Fundamental Issues (Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell, 2003), 9-58. 475</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Second, Friedman makes an assumption that students first need a lot of (basic) facts before they need a conceptualization. This may have been true in the early stages of Holocaust research, some fifty to sixty years ago. Today, however, the field of Holocaust research is enormously broad, and the relevant facts are legion. As a lecturer, I would say that studentsfirst need to get acquainted with the definitions, conceptualizations, and strategies of research because these will direct them to the important facts. Third, when Friedman says that his book "is offered as a synthesis of sources and issues," one's expectations should not be too high. The chapters are basically ordered according to chronology and countries, and within those chapters, according to topics, dictated by the point of view of political history. Within the geographic context, the Jews of North Africa are forgotten (as well as many parts of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union), and within the topical issues, social, bureaucratic, organizational, educational, and other aspects are overlooked (both on the side of the perpetrators and on the side of the Jews).3 Friedman constantly uses the general expressions "the Nazis" and "the Germans" when he talks about the development of anti-Jewish policies, and thus he misses the enormous achievements of perpetrator research in the last two and a half decades. This research has emphasized the complex, "twisted" esca- lation on one hand, and the initiatives and broad participation of many groups in German society and in the occupied and cooperating countries-not only the Nazi top brass-on the other hand. Jewish society is gravely underrepresented-it is mainly dealt with in Chapter 18, "Jewish Armed Resistance"-and its descriptions are very generalized. As a result, many real basic issues are not discussed in any way that can help students. An illuminating example is provided by a passage in which Friedman explains the "creation of the Judenrats" (a relevant issue in Chapter 8, "World War II Begins: The Polish Ghettos"): In a gesture designed to confound the Jews, late in September [1939], Hey- drich ordered the creation of Judenrats in towns with populations exceeding 10,000. Jews could not be suspicious of councils whose functions were remi- niscent of their own Kehillas. What they did not realize was that these 24-man councils would be chaired by men like Adam Czerniakow in Warsaw, Chaim Rumkowski in Lodz, Jacob Gens in Vilna, and Moshe Merin in Sosnowiec, second-tier leaders who fancied themselves as Shtadlanim (respected inter- cessors) and who in fact were regarded by Jews and Germans alike as Hofjuden (Court Jews). (92) What can be said of such a distorted depiction of both the German intentions and the Jewish reactions and interpretations, as well as Friedman's mixing up of the situation in 1939 with that of 1941 (Vilna was occupied in Barbarossa)? 3. Indeed, one could claim that it is impossible to cover everything, but then, one has to remem- ber that is what Friedman has opted for. 476</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Fourth, in addition to the neglect of many important studies published in Europe (not to mention Israel) in recent years, the book contains many annoy- ing mistakes. In the very first sentence, the Hebrew word olah is misspelled in Hebrew and mistransliterated into English (into oleh), and korban is mistrans- literated into kurban. There are similar misspellings in German. On page 93, for example, Heydrich is quoted as speaking of a fremdsprdchigen Gau Krakau in his Schnellbrief, in fact, this does not appear there but in the protocol of the meeting on which the Schnellbrief was based. On page 108, Friedman writes that "in 1939, 100,000 of 140,000 Jews living in Holland were killed by the Nazis. The mortality rate of over 70 percent is unmatched anywhere save among Polish Jews. France lost 90,000 (33 percent) of its 270,000 Jews, Belgium 35,000 (40 percent) of its 90,000." None of these statistical data are correct (even though Friedman provides a bibliography, in which the accurate numbers are given). And so on. Friedman writes that "the shelf-life of good text-books ... is rather short." One of the best textbooks on Holocaust historiography (quoted by Friedman only in passing) is the one written by Leni Yahil, The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945, which was published in English in 1990 (in Hebrew in 1987 and in German in 1998). Although fifteen years have passed since its publication, it is in many ways more updated than the book under review here, and it gives clear and helpful introductions to major issues of the Holocaust, as well as accurate basic data; it undoubtedly still deserves (and has received at many universities) a longer shelf life.
