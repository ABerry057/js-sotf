<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry Near. The Kibbutz Movement: A History. Vol. 1. Origins and Growth, 1909-1939. Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. Oxford: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1992. xvii, 431 pp. Henry Near, in this long and scholarly volume, aims at giving the reader "a clear narrative account of the genesis of the kibbutz, and the way it grew from one tiny group in 1910, to reach a population of some 24,000 in 79 communities on the verge of the Second World War" (p. ix). In order to reach this goal, Near brings us every primary source on the topic, making this material available to the non-Hebrew reader for the first time. The details are both the strong point of the volume as well as the weak point; for the specialist it is a treasure trove of information, but for the uninitiated, it is overwhelming. Near is at his best when he succinctly analyzes the material. For example, in describing the decade following World War I, he notes that "seven separate varieties of Kibbutz ideology developed and were embodied in organizational form" (p. 162). By 1930 three survived. Why, asks the author, despite the commonality of their basic values-Zionism, communitarianism, direct democracy, self-labor--did they choose to remain separate? He answers that this was because of generational differences, class differences, geographical divisions, and personality clashes, briefly elaborating on each. Near is at his worst when he details item after item, clash after clash, debate after debate. Any good doctoral mentor would insist on major editing</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 249 throughout the book. We all, after working for years on a topic, fall into the trap of thinking that every piece of information laboriously culled must be included in our book. Editing is one of our most difficult tasks but an absolutely necessary one. Near should have put material that is interesting but extraneous to the flow of the thesis where it belongs-in the footnotes. Of particular interest to me is the description of the intertwined history of the pioneering youth movements with the development of the kibbutz. "They supplied the reserves of manpower without which the kibbutzim would inevitably have entered a demographic decline" (p. 96). They also influenced the ideological development of the kibbutz movement and were influenced in turn. I also found that the material on the period of "tower and stockade" well done, for Near goes to great pains to show how this was an outgrowth of a long tradition of self-defense. His citing of Kenneth Stein's The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984) underscores the scholarly approach to this controversial material. Near is careful to constantly place his theme within the larger context of Zionist and Jewish history, both in the Yishuv and in Europe. This broadens his topic and explains internal events more clearly. It is one thing to say that the kibbutzim were somewhat prosperous in the early 1930s; it is another to explain that this was attributable not only to the kibbutz members' own efforts but also to the growth of the nonagricultural sector of the Yishuv-e.g., Tel Aviv and Jewish Haifa-which provided a growing market for the eggs, milk, grain, and fruit produced by the kibbutzim. This in turn is attributed to the rise of Hitler in Germany and the horrible economic situation of the Jews in Poland, which resulted in both countries sending Jews to Palestine since the doors to "golden" America were now difficult to open. From this reviewer's perspective, there are a number of small points of criticism that should be mentioned. One is the omission of the most objective and accurate book on the post-1936 mandate years, namely J. C. Hurewitz's The Struggle for Palestine (New York, 1950). Another is the lip service paid to the importance of water and the total omission of the Rutenberg works with its supplying of hydroelectricity to the Yishuv. More could have been said about the religious kibbutzim than how they solved practical problems according to Jewish law. Finally, although it was good to see some space devoted to women in the kibbutz, the amount of space is paltry compared to that devoted to each nuance of ideological difference in each kibbutz and socialist movement.</page><page sequence="3">250 BOOK REVIEWS Rahel Yanait Ben-Zvi's name does not even appear in the book, let alone her writings describing the attempt to establish women's farm settlements in the 1920s. Near's final chapter, entitled "Comments and Conclusions," is excellent. After summarizing economic and social developments and changes from the Second Aliyah to 1939, he asks whether the kibbutzim of the late 1930s were faithful to the principles of the Second Aliyah. He responds that the answer, on the whole, is affirmative. The kibbutz movements were far from unanimous on questions concerning the relationship between the kibbutz and the outside world, but there was congruence between the interests of the kibbutz and those of the Yishuv. The author's last musing question, asked almost as an aside, should have been part of the focus of the book. Why was the kibbutz created and successfully developed in this particular place (Palestine) and by these particular people when the socialist philosophy existed in so many parts of the Western world? Near almost apologetically seems to conclude that the deeper reason is something basically Jewish: values of mutual aid and social responsibility that trace back to the Bible. This should have been stated in the introduction to the book and worked into the long text, and not saved for a brief comment at the end.
