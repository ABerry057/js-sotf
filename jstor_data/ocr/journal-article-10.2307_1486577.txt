Louisville: Westmin- ster/John Knox Press, 1991. 214 pp. Devora Steinmetz's insightful monograph, From Father to Son, is one of the early releases in a new series entitled Literary Currents in Biblical Interpretation. While one is thus immediately conscious of Steinmetz's general approach to her material, she includes a psychological/anthropological twist that makes for interesting reading. According to Steinmetz, "the [patriarchal] family is threatened by the twin dangers of conflict between members and loss of identity: either the family members remain together and threaten to destroy one another, or they separate and are in danger of being lost to the family's special mission" (p. 11). The mutual promise and threat inherent in the father-son relationship is at the core of this conflict for which resolution must somehow be achieved. The text, comprising about 140 pages (there are about 50 pages of end notes), is divided into five chapters. In chapter 1, Steinmetz reviews various psychological and anthropological approaches to the father-son conflict, discusses her own approach to this problem, and nicely outlines how she will treat the biblical material in the next four chapters. In chapter 2 she analyzes "crucial stories of transfer from father to son" in the patriarchal accounts, while in chapter 3 she analyzes word patterns employed in relating these kinship conflicts and begins to examine specific episodes and patterns in the larger narrative context of Genesis 12-50. This broader view is continued in</page><page sequence="2">282 BOOK REVIEWS chapter 4, entitled "Mothers, Brothers and the Land." It is only in chapter 5 that Steinmetz goes beyond the material in Genesis 12-50 as she contextualizes the patriarchal accounts, explaining them as typologically "fulfilling the earlier design of creation" and as "prefiguring the later experiences of the nation" (p. 134). Steinmetz notes in her preface that "this book is the culmination of nine years of writing and reflection" (p. 9). The number and variety of her observations serve to continually remind the reader of the author's experience with, not just exposure to, the text of Genesis. She communicates her views in a very readable style and clearly fulfills her goal of explicating the force of kinship in Genesis 12-50. I gained many insights into the literary values of these texts. The author regularly provides transliterations and translations of important Hebrew words and phrases, so while familiarity with Hebrew enhances one's appreciation of the discussion, it is not essential for comprehension. It is of interest and value that Steinmetz draws on early and medieval Jewish interpretations in addition to modern views of various passages. By way of minor complaints, I did not like the style of transliteration adopted in this work. In addition to the lack of diacritical marks (distinguishing h from h, or t from .t, for example), rendering letters as they are pronounced is less than desirable. The word/phrase vayignov, for example (p. 182, n. 48), does not begin and end with the same Hebrew letter! (While it may be argued that readers who know Hebrew will be able to accurately discern the word[s] in question, I do not care for this format.) Also, Steinmetz occasionally attempts to extract too much from a text, creating observations from interpretations. For example, she states that "Abraham goes to a foreign land suddenly and without motivation (Gen. 20:1)" (p. 66), but the text merely notes that he went, not when, how, or for what reason(s) or lack thereof. Her observation exhibits a hyperdependence on the received text of the Bible (since no motives are ascribed to him at this point, Abraham must have had none). Must we assume that every phrase was consciously constructed and is pregnant with discernible meaning? My greatest reservation about the book regards something that is not expressed. It is the opinion of Steinmetz (and others) that "ancient literature is ... a social construct,... an artifact left by a society struggling to define itself," and that it "reflects the society's perception of its very nature" (p. 30). Having said this, it seems methodologically appropriate to observe that Genesis 12-50 is all that exists from ancient Israel concerning the patriarchs.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 283 Given that, I would appreciate at least a brief exploration of the author's thinking on questions such as: how representative an "artifact" of Israelite society's perceptions of itself is the patriarchal account? what if we had more and/or different textual traditions (they may well have existed)? did all levels of Israelite society at all times perceive this "artifact" the same way? in this regard, does it matter how, when, or by whom the text reached its final form (see her brief comment that "the history of the text ... is not important for this study" [p. 33])? is it important or necessary to even raise such questions? The book would benefit from some general methodological statements in this vein. While not everyone will agree with her approach or all of her conclusions (I did not), any reader who takes it on its own terms will be rewarded for time spent with Steinmetz's book. For someone looking for a fresh and engaging approach to the patriarchal narratives, this book has much to offer. Dana M. Pike Brigham Young University Provo, Utah</page></plain_text>
