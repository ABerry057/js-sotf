<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tamar M. Rudavsky. Time Matters: Time, Creation, and Cosmology in Medieval Jewish Philosophy. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000. xviii, 287 pp. Analytically oriented philosophers have long practiced their skills on Christian classics of medieval philosophy. More recently, attention has been paid to medieval Jewish and Islamic texts. Because Latin philosophy is unthink- able apart from the scholarly and philosophical labors of Muslims and Jews, this makes perfect sense. But there is a touch of chauvinism at work as well: Because Muslim and Jewish philosophers, no less than their Christian counterparts, were philosophically active, imaginative, and clever, shouldn't they, too, be available for the continuing development of Western philosophy? Tamar Rudavsky certainly thinks so, and in Time Matters: Time, Creation, and Cosmology in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, she makes the case admirably and convincingly. Instead of focusing on individual philosophers, Rudavsky introduces a familiar cast-Saadia, HaLevi, Ibn Gabirol, Ibn Daud, Maimonides, Gersonides, Crescas, Albo, and Spinoza-in the context of a set of wide-ranging but tightly interconnected philosophical and theological problems related to time, creation, and cosmology. These topics, in turn, encompass fundamental dilemmas regarding divine omniscience, freedom and determinism, the nature of infinity, Zeno's paradoxes, and the immortality of the soul. Between an introductory chapter that locates the source of medieval quand- aries in the conflicting but overlapping worldviews of biblical, rabbinic, and Greek philosophical texts and a brief concluding chapter on the incorruptibility of the universe as a whole and of human life as we know it, Rudavsky presents four sub- stantial chapters on time and creation; time, motion, and the instant; temporality, human freedom, and divine omniscience; and Spinoza's "prelude to modernity." Each chapter comes with a brief introduction and conclusion-welcome given the complexity of the material-and ample bibliographic and explanatory notes. Rudavsky seeks to reconstruct, with precision, the issues, positions, and arguments that constitute a medieval Jewish response to philosophical questions about time. Yet she does not hesitate to challenge the broad claims of other scholars-for example, in insisting that time is central to Maimonides' treatment of creation and that medieval Jewish discussions of time are essential for under- standing Spinoza. Nor does she shy away from critically assessing the philosophi- cal views she elaborates. When it comes to the problem of divine omniscience and 462</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews human freedom, she argues that Maimonides' defense of their compatibility amounts (by his own lights) to a "leap of faith" and that the ingenious efforts of Gersonides cannot explain how God enables prophets to prophesy without undermining the freedom of the prophesied actions. Crescas's solution, which relies on the Boethian view of divine eternity, fails as well, according to Rudavsky. Despite recent philosophical efforts to resuscitate Boethius, she claims his notion of eternity leaves no room for possibility, without which there can be no freedom. Rudavsky may or may not be right in her assessments, but that is secondary to her decided success in opening up these philosophers to contemporary philosophical engagement. Rudavsky's application of analytical techniques is particularly illuminating in Chapter 3, "Time, Motion, and the Instant: Jewish Philosophers Confront Zeno." Readers will appreciate her introduction to the profound Philoponous, detailed reconstruction of an argument by Ibn Gabirol, discussion of how Jewish philosophers responded to Kalam arguments, and account of Gersonides on the continuum, which Rudavsky finds "surprisingly modem." Unfortunately, Rudavsky does not draw on William Craig's defense of the Kalam cosmological argument (in his book of that title), which would have added more depth and philosophical interest to her discussion. An ironic aspect of Rudavsky's work is the absence of any explicit recon- struction of arguments by Maimonides, himself a master at reconstructing argu- ments. Given the contested nature of the purpose, structure, and method of the Guide, applying analytical techniques to its arguments may have required a more holistic and extended discussion than Rudavsky's format could accommo- date. It is striking that since Rudavsky's book appeared, a number of philosophers with Rudavsky's analytical orientation have published book-length treatments of Maimonides. An apparent exception to the claim that there are no reconstructions of arguments by Maimonides deserves comment. Rudavsky devotes the opening section of Chapter 2 to "Astronomy and Cosmology: The True Perplexity Revealed," a reference to Maimonides's comment in Guide 2:24 that the "true perplexity" is the contradiction between Aristotle's cosmology and Ptolemy's astronomy. Although Rudavsky appears to present an argument with twelve numbered statements, it is really only a series of important points. No conclusion or reasoning is apparent. In the valuable discussion that follows, Rudavsky refers to these points, along with distinctions between "per se" and "accidental" features of the world and the human knower, in order to address one of the central issues in Maimonidean studies: the nature and source of limits on human knowledge. Rudavsky moves too quickly in attempting to answer this question, however. She does not appreciate the ambiguity of the points she takes to support one view over another, partly because, despite introducing the distinction between "per se" and "accidental," she fails to employ it in all references to the world and the knower. In her introduction, Rudavsky tentatively identifies a subsidiary theme of her work: "that the medieval Jewish attempts to understand time and cosmology are relevant to contemporary thinking about these issues.... Our attempt to 463</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews construct theories of temporality and cosmology that are sensitive to the con- straints of philosophy, modem science, and theology are analogous to the attempts of our philosophical predecessors." If Rudavsky means that a philosopher today who accepts the Bible as divine revelation and believes in God will have to face many of the problems presented in her book, I would agree-with the caveat that many of the problems she reviews are rooted in a metaphysical theology that is no longer compelling. But Rudavsky seems to intend a stronger claim: that today's philosophers who are interested in time and cosmology will have to face many of the pro- blems she has canvassed. This strikes me as implausible. Most philosophers neither accept the Bible as divine revelation nor believe that there are philoso- phically or scientifically compelling reasons to believe in God. Consequently, when these philosophers approach questions about time and cosmology, or even metaphysical questions about the origins of the universe, they are not engaging in an enterprise with theological constraints. And even should they enjoy trying to square divine omniscience with human freedom-the topic of Rudavsky's longest chapter-their effort is likely to be an elaborate logic exercise rather than the pressing religious and philosophical issue it once was. Time Matters belongs in the library of every scholar of medieval philosophy, and it will be especially welcomed by students, scholars, and "enlightened" readers who care about medieval Jewish philosophy.
