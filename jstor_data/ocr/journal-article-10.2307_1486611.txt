<plain_text><page sequence="1">96 BOOK REVIEWS Natalie Isser. Antisemitism During the French Second Empire. American University Studies, Series IX; History, vol. 100. New York: Peter Lang, 1991. 149 pp. Although historians often have dismissed the Second Empire (1852-1870) as a "golden age" for Jews prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Natalie Isser insists that these years constituted a seminal period in the development of French antisemitism. According to Isser, it was during the reign of Napoleon III that the banner of antisemitism passed from the camp of the socialist left to that of the ultramontane right. Moreover, Isser argues, this clerical antisemitism influenced not only the emergence of a virulent strain of Catholic antisemitism at the time of the Dreyfus Affair, but the more secular varieties of fin-de-siecle antisemitism as well. The main focus of Isser's attention is the way Jewish issues often surfaced in the emerging conflict between the church and the French state, especially during the liberal phase of Napoleon III's reign, beginning in the late 1850s. Although Napoleon III had allied himself with clerical interests in the early years of his reign, this alliance was a shambles by the end of the 1850s, due largely to French support for Italian unification, which the pope perceived as a threat to his temporal power. Isser's main concern, therefore, is with the way the relationship between the French state and the papacy often revolved around Jewish matters, and in so doing provoked an antisemitic backlash on the part of French ultramontane Catholics. The most acrimonious of these contests between Napoleon III and the pope was the Mortara Affair of 1858, in which a six-year-old Jewish child was kidnapped by Vatican agents because his Christian nurse secretly had baptized him. As Isser shows, the Mortara Affair pitted the papacy's claim to supteme power over the salvation of the soul against the rights of the Jewish parents. In this instance, as in the Montel Affair of 1840, which also involved the kidnapping of a French Jewish girl who had been baptized secretly, France emerged as the principal defender of the rights of the family against the unlimited power of the church. Because the Montels were French citizens, the French government was able to persuade the Vatican to return the child to her parents. It did not have the same success in the Mortara case, however. The Mortaras were Vatican subjects, and the Mortara child was never returned. The prolonged battle between the French state and the church over</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 97 the Mortara Affair had far-reaching consequences in France. Although the Catholic laity, according to Isser, largely agreed with the government that the rights of the parents superceded those of the church, French ultramontane Catholics, and especially the publicist Louis Veuillot, used the occasion to whip up a virulent antisemitic campaign. According to Veuillot, the Jews were orchestrating a worldwide protest against the papacy over this issue, and he increasingly identified Jews with everything Catholics detested about the modern world: secularism, materialism, and the pernicious ideas of the French Revolution. Similar conflicts between the French state and the church continued to sour Catholic-Jewish relations throughout the 1860s. Forced conversions, though never widespread, persisted, and debates regarding cler- ical influence over education also frequently centered on the rights of Jewish students. Isser's study raises a number of important issues, but unfortunately most of these are never articulated with any clarity. First, despite Isser's emphasis on the virulent Catholic antisemitism that developed in this period, the major impression conveyed by her study is that the Second Empire was a "golden age" for French Jews in many respects. As she herself points out, the govern- ment of Napoleon III consistently defended Jewish rights both at home and abroad. It eliminated all barriers to equal educational opportunities and made a concerted effort to appoint Jewish teachers. Moreover, an unprecedented number of Jews were appointed to high-level government posts during this period. The regime also protected the rights of French Jews who were traveling or working abroad. Furthermore, the government never hesitated to use its censorship powers to prosecute antisemitic slander. Such activity contrasts sharply with that during the Third Republic, when the 1881 press law made it virtually impossible to prosecute defamation cases. In the final analysis, therefore, the author's portrait of the Second Empire as a period of unprecedented official toleration supports the traditional view of this period, and casts doubt on recent interpretations that France throughout much of the nineteenth century was neither as liberal nor as tolerant as historians formerly suggested. Isser's focus on clerical antisemitism is an interesting and important one, but her own evidence suggests that she has vastly overrated the movement's significance, at least for the decade of the 1860s. At one point she suggests that the repercussions of the Mortara Affair were similar to those of the Dreyfus Affair, but at other times she claims that most of the Catholic laity,</page><page sequence="3">98 BOOK REVIEWS in addition to many liberal clergymen, did not share Veuillot's extremist views. Yet, even if Veuillot's movement was more of a fringe phenomenon than Isser would have us believe, she is almost certainly correct to point out that Veuillot's variety of antisemitism exerted a major influence on the subsequent development of Catholic antisemitism in France, a point the existing literature on French antisemitism all too often ignores. Moreover, Isser is correct to point out that the Catholic antisemitism that emerged during this period was not simply a restatement of traditional Christian anti-Jewish themes, but was a distinctly modern movement. As she illustrates, Catholic antisemitism was neither static nor traditional. Rather, in its increasingly strident tone as well as in its use of mass propaganda, it was no less modern than its secular counterparts. Furthermore, by stressing the role of the clerical right in the subsequent development of secular antisemitism, Isser challenges, albeit unwittingly, Zeev Sternhell's thesis, put forth in his book La Droite revolutionnaire, 1885-1914: Les origines frangaises du fascisme (Paris, 1978), that late-nineteenth-century antisemitism grew out of a left-wing rather than a right-wing tradition. Finally, an important subtheme of Isser's book is the degree to which the Central Consistory was willing to protest antisemitism publicly and to request government intervention to stamp it out. Indeed, Isser's discussion suggests that the Central Consistory was consistently successful in eliciting positive governmental responses to its appeals. While this trend illustrates the government's firm commitment to Jewish rights, it also demonstrates the considerable degree of security and confidence French Jews felt. And, although Isser fails to make this point, this evidence also suggests that Jews during the Second Empire were not passive when it came to protesting antisemitism, contrary to Michael Marrus's thesis as stated in The Politics of Assimilation: A Study of the French Jewish Community at the Tinte of the Dreyfus Affair (New York, 1971). Despite the importance of these themes, this book is so poorly written and organized that much of what is valuable simply gets lost. Too frequently, the author seems completely unaware of the larger issues at stake. She has completely missed an opportunity to discuss what this subject reveals about the general nature of Napoleon III's regime or about the internal schisms within the French church. Moreover, the author frequently fails to define what she is talking about. She never adequately explains what France's special relationship to the Vatican was, and she frequently alludes to people and</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 99 incidents without describing who or what they were. Numerous contradictory statements are never cleared up. For instance, at some points she argues that antisemitism was directed only at less assimilated Jews, while elsewhere she acknowledges that highly assimilated Jews were its chief targets. To make matters worse, the book is peppered with egregious spelling, grammatical, and typographical errors, and there are occasional errors in the numbering of the footnotes (p. 120) and in the index. The writing is often so stilted that it is impossible to decipher the meaning. Finally, the bibliography is completely out of date. Although the author spends a considerable time discussing Jewish involvement in the Saint-Simonian movement, she fails to mention Michael Graetz's book, Les Juifs en France au xixe sidcle: de la revolution frangaise a l'Alliance Israelite Universelle (Paris, 1989), which is the major study of this phenomenon. Nor is there any mention of the work of Phyllis Cohen Albert, especially her essay "Ethnicity and Jewish Solidarity in 19th-Century France," in J. Reinharz and D. Swetschinski, eds., Mystics, Philosophers and Politicians (Durham, N.C., 1982), and Jay R. Berkovitz's The Shaping of Jewish Identity in Nineteenth-Century France (Detroit, 1989), which together with Graetz's study would have contributed significantly to the author's discussion of antisemitism. Clearly, this book never passed through the hands of a copy editor, and one can only hope that the publisher will remedy this situation in the future. In the end, because this book is so confused and confusing, it will be of use primarily to specialists in French Jewish history. Although Isser has some interesting insights into the nature of clerical antisemitism during the Second Empire, this subject still awaits more thorough, comprehensive, and lucid historical analysis.
