Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982. x, 306 pp. The application of sociological methods to the history of religions may offend some of the faithful, but few scholars would deny the contribution of these methods to the understanding of religious phenomena. From the pioneering theoretical work of Weber and Durkheim to recent studies, such as Melford Spiro's Buddhism and Society and the numerous sociological analyses of Christian origins, the discipline has challenged and stimulated the critical investigation of religion in general and of many great religious traditions. 2.

Its subject matter is defined as "the religion of the Jewish folk or masses"; in its discussion of medieval millenarian movements, Sabbatian- ism, Hasidism, and Zionism, it is concerned with the religious doctrines of the intellectual elite not for their own intrinsic value, but for their impact upon popular expressions of Judaism. The approach is delineated by con- trast with that of nineteenth-century Wissenschaft, Gershom Scholem, and Marxist historians such as Raphael Mahler (although curiously, the work of S. W. Baron and Jacob Katz is not mentioned in this context); the author's purpose is to "link the religious and social histories of the Jews within a sociological framework." The underlying assumption is that "religious beliefs, practices and movements originate and develop under certain social conditions, and a plausible link can be made between social conditions and religious phenomena." One limitation of the book should be stated at the outset. The author is by training a sociologist, not a historian. He has obviously read widely in contemporary Jewish historical writing available in Hebrew and English, and he summarizes this material with accuracy and intelligence. But the specialist in Jewish studies should not expect to find new discoveries in this book. There are no new documents, no new data, and little interpretation of source material. As far as I can tell, neither the book nor the bibliography reveals any use of primary sources, except for collections such as Aescoly on messianic movements and Hertzberg on Zionism. While the book begins with a critique of nineteenth- and twentieth-century historiography, it is totally dependent on the fruits of this historiography for its data. Sharot's contribution to Jewish studies must therefore lie in his method. What can be expected from the application of a sociological framework to familiar Jewish movements? The least productive result is the introduction of a new jargon: "The former marranos had gone through the experience of what Peter Berger has termed alternation: they had passed between logically contradictory meaning systems" (p. 108); "Following Weber's typology of religious leaders, the zaddik is best described as a mystagogue" (p. 158); "On the journey to the court and in the court itself the Hasidim created a form of society which Victor Turner has called communitas" (p. 167). The long chapter on the spread of Hasidism is subsumed under Weber's some- what paradoxical phrase, "the routinization of charisma." Such assertions may not always avoid the pitfall of implying that once an unusual word has been applied, the phenomenon itself has been understood.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 127 More productive is the attempt to apply generalizations from the socio- logical theory of religion to issues of medieval and modern Jewish religious history. In his final, theoretical chapter, Sharot uses the Hasidic movement to test Mary Douglas's hypotheses about the relationship between religious doctrine and levels of social organization and control. For example, Doug- las, following Durkheim, suggested that the greater the degree of alienation from the established social order, the greater will be the tendency to empha- size the independence and separation of the spiritual realm from the material. Sharot's argument that early Hasidism reflects precisely the oppo- site correlation, as the movement both challenged the established pattern of social organization and proposed a greater integration of the spiritual and material realms than was usually assumed, should be of interest to the socio- logist of religion, and the formulation of the issue in these terms may well stimulate the student of Hasidic thought. Ideally, the sociological approach should provide a different way of analyzing data and explaining them. The reader whose background is in Jewish studies will probably judge that the book devotes far too much space to a descriptive recounting of familiar events, and too little to interpretation and explanation. Yet even where this is attempted, the results are mixed. Sharot is too sophisticated a sociologist and too conscientious a student of modern Jewish historical writing to be satisfied with a simplistic, reduction- ist approach that would explain all religious phenomena exclusively in social terms. But by recognizing the multiplicity of historical causation, he tends to retreat from the very explanations he proposes, thereby undercutting the significance of his approach. After a survey of "normative Jewish millenarianism" and messianic movements through the period of the Crusades, the author concludes, "no single explanation can account for all the millennial instances in the dias- pora," not the Crusades themselves, nor economic hardship, nor political subordination, nor disruption of social life. Regarding Sabbatianism, Sharot follows those who have questioned the Scholem thesis, arguing that the influence of Lurianic Kabbalah may be a contributing factor in the movement's spread, but not a "sufficient or even a major cause." In his judgment, the distinctive religious psychology of the former marranos and the precipitous economic decline in the mid-seventeenth century were more significant. Again, the discussion "points not to one cause but to a conver- gence of factors. . . . general cultural and psychological considerations, especially those that affected the former marranos, as well as social and economic factors, were of great importance."</page><page sequence="4">128 BOOK REVIEWS Discussing the spread of Hasidism, Sharot endorses the conclusion of Raphael Mahler that the major "social carrier" remained the impoverished lower middle class, which was being undermined by the encroachment of modern capitalism, yet he immediately qualifies this by noting that in spreading from its original centers, Hasidism became considerably more heterogeneous in economic, social, and educational status. He reaches the not exactly earth-shattering conclusion that the "miracle-working zaddi- kim" appealed to the poor, unsophisticated lower middle class of the small towns, while the "scholarly zaddikim" appealed to the wealthiest and more educated strata, but immediately continues, "The variation in the dominant forms of Hasidism cannot, however, be explained simply by economic class differences." Such caution in the formulation of conclusions is, in a way, refreshing. But it also makes the special contribution of the sociological approach less clear. Sharot does commit himself unequivocally about the predominantly Sephardic character of medieval millenarianism. His explanation is that the Sephardim "felt secure in and strongly identified with the dominant culture" far more than did the Ashkenazic Jews. Therefore, when persecution occurred, it was perceived not as a normal characteristic of galut, but as a catastrophe that created serious disorientation. "It would appear, therefore, that millenarianism was a response to disaster among a people whose leaders had enjoyed wealth, status, and power, and who had been rejected by a society into which they had formerly been highly integrated, culturally and socially." Paradigmatic is the career of Abravanel. Many questions may be raised about this hypothesis, and historians may well find it not fully con- vincing, but at least it is a clear sociological explanation that can be tested against known historical data. The most solid sections of the book are those that treat contemporary material. The chapter on Hasidism in modern society contains some illu- minating comparisons with Christian introversionist sects, such as the Amish and the Hutterites. And the treatment of Gush Emunim against the background both of historical Jewish millenarianism and of the particular social context of the 1970s brings the book's subject matter into focus on a topic of considerable contemporary importance. I would guess that this book should be of value to sociologists interested in religion and to students of comparative religion for whom the scholarly studies written in Hebrew are inaccessible. Specialists in the traditional dis- ciplines of Jewish studies may indeed find familiar material occasionally</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 129 placed in a provocative theoretical context, but they are not likely to con- clude that important new ground has been broken.
