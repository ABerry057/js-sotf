Allison Park, Pa.: Pickwick Publications, 1994. xiii, 385 pp. Women were marginalized in the cult of ancient Israel, as reflected in the Hebrew Bible in general, and in the legislation of the Pentateuchal Priestly source in particular. This practice was a precedent for the minor role granted women in Jewish communal worship until this day. Yet marginalization in temple ritual does not entail exclusion from religious life. Recent scholarship, sensitized by feminist concerns, has done much to place women in their proper position in ancient Israelite religious practice. Although women were excluded from the priesthood, they participated in sacrifice, made and paid</page><page sequence="2">370 BOOK REVIEWS vows, played auxiliary roles, etc.' They were also major players in community events, such as victory celebrations or public and private mourning rites. The restriction of women in the cultic sphere contrasts markedly to the cultic systems of contiguous societies, such as that of ancient Mesopotamia, in which women assumed major roles. Richard A. Henshaw now offers us a massive volume intended to place women's roles in Israelite religious life in proper perspective against a backdrop of contemporary cults. It casts a wide net, identifying and examining all religious functionaries of both genders and various sexual inclinations from ancient Israel, ancient Mesopotamia, and Ugarit. The purpose is to point out and, presumably, to explain the varying extent of women's and men's participation in these societies and geographical areas. The major source for this study is a host of professional titles gleaned from Mesopotamian lexical lists. The titles in these ancient thesauruses are examined individually, explained with relationship to adjacent terms in the lists, and illuminated by evidence ferreted out from hundreds of nonlexical texts. This huge amount of material is presented in four chapters dealing, respectively, with the main cultic functionaries responsible for conducting divine worship and caring for the temples, performers of cultic music and dance, practitioners of magic and mantic rituals aimed at communicating with and influencing the divine sphere, and roles related to sexuality or fertility. The last-mentioned chapter addresses sacred marriage rites, cultic prostitution, and the use of harlotry as a metaphor for Israel's infidelity to God. In each chapter the Mesopotamian evidence is compared and contrasted with parallel material found in the Bible. The subject of the book is fascinating, significant, and of great con- temporary interest. It may be said to its credit that the volume reflects no particular social agenda. It makes available huge amounts of raw material, much of which is novel and strange to anyone who is not an Assyriologist. Studying cultural, social, and economic phenomena by analysis of the relevant native vocabulary takes its cue from such classics of Assyriology as Benno Landsberger's study on the date-palm industry or A. Leo Oppenheim's volumes on glass-making and beer-brewing.2 1. See especially the philologically sound study of M. Gruber, "Women in the Cult According to the Priestly Code," in Judaic Perspectives ofAncient Israel, ed. J. Neusner, B. A. Levine, and E. S. Frerichs (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), pp. 35-48. 2. B.

The order in which the material is presented is vague. Chapter divisions are clear, but individual sections are in a serious state of disarray, the titles studied in the various chapters appearing haphazardly. Titles are not arranged fully by topic, nor do they consistently follow the order found in any particular lexical text. So, for example, the discussion of Akkadian sangu (high priest) is followed immediately by a foray into the Bible. Not only is the high priest investigated here, but all other functionaries in the Israelite cult, major and minor. Two sections dealing with witchcraft interrupt treatments of the functionally similar ecstatics, prophets, and diviners. Numerous scholarly opinions about sacred prostitutes and cultic prostitution are reviewed in no obvious order, without any attempt to combine the suggestions of authorities with similar points of view. Biblical material has been slighted. There is no systematic study of the Levites who performed cultic and paracultic roles, among them singers and musicians, nor is there any thorough discussion of the high priest's role. Casting around trying to catch every fish in the sea, Henshaw inevitably dredges up some boots, bottles, and tires. For example, the Akkadian word palihtu, "fearer" (feminine participle) is presented as if it were a professional title, whereas it is clearly only an adjective. Hebrew 'Ildmot, "young women" is included as if it were a cultic title and not a designation of the young ladies coincidentally engaged in cultic singing. There are occasional confusions and inconsistencies in the use of English terms such as witchcraft and divination. Goddesses worshipped in the cult are barely distinguished from female cultic functionaries. The most serious shortcoming, however, is a lack of synthesis. Indeed, the central problem of the book-that of the relative roles of women in the cults of the various cultures-is never addressed in a sustained manner. It is alluded to sporadically and perfunctorily, but no well-developed conclusions are presented. Although the plethora of women's roles in Mesopotamia is occasionally related to the existence of numerous goddesses in the pantheon, this correlation is never developed seriously. Since the role of goddesses seems to have diminished in Mesopotamian cult over the years, there should (Graz, 1967); A. L. Oppenheim, Glass and Glassmaking in Ancient Mesopotamia (Corning, N.Y., 1970); L. F. Hartman and A. L.

Was there? In general, there is no historical dimension to the work. A gold mine of information lies buried between the covers of this book, but much patience is demanded to extract it and give it speech.
