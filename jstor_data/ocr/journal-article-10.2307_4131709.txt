Sources for the Study of Jewish Culture 5. Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Stud- ies, 1998. 255 pp. (Hebrew). Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of studies devoted to medieval Hebrew science, but few editions and explications of texts. In this book, Ruth Glasner provides a critical edition and exhaustive analysis of two polemical letters pertaining to physics by the fourteenth-century Provencal poet and philosopher Je- daiah ha-Penini (Bedersi) (born ca. 1285). These letters were largely forgotten un- til S. Pines drew attention to their significance and called for their publication over 364</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews thirty years ago. That call has been answered in exemplary fashion in the present volume. The two works are especially significant because the editor is able to iden- tify Ha-Penini's anonymous opponent with Levi Gersonides (1288-1344), me- dieval Jewry's most illustrious scientist/philosopher. She reconstructs the stages of their controversy from an initial face-to-face encounter, followed by a letter from Gersonides to Ha-Penini (no longer extant), then to the latter's response in the Treatise on Opposite Motions, and culminating in a final round consisting of Gersonides' criticisms (also no longer extant) and Ha-Penini's last word in the Book of Confutation. This reconstruction seems plausible, although the evidence for an initial letter by Gersonides is weak. The Treatise on Opposite Motions may have been prompted by Ha-Penini's desire to expand on the positions he had tak- en during his discussion with Gersonides. In any event, the letters provide an im- portant record, albeit one-sided, of an actual scientific controversy by two distin- guished philosophers in fourteenth-century Jewish Provence. They are, therefore, of great importance for understanding the high level of philosophical culture in that period. The starting-point for the controversy is Aristotle's view that celestial bod- ies rotate in a uniform circular motion in one direction, unlike sublunar elements, which move naturally up, in the case of fire and air, or down, in the case of earth and water. Underlying this view is the claim that circular motion possesses no con- traries. An ambiguous comment by Averroes in his commentary to De Coelo 1:4 leads the protagonists into a discussion of the notion of contrariety with respect to motion, and, since locomotion involves change of location, to the question of whether there is contrariety with respect to locale. Because these notions invoke fundamental principles in Aristotle's logic, physics, and mathematics, the contro- versy ranges over such concepts as the natural places of the elements; natural and violent motion; the four primary qualities of hot, cold, dry, and moist; gravity and levity; qualitative change; the essential forms of the elements; and the relationship between mathematics and physics. For all of Ha-Penini's originality, he is generally closer to Averroes on these matters than is Gersonides. He accepts and defends Aristotle's claim that contrari- ety exists in the category of locale, whereas Gersonides simply rejects it. He ac- cepts Aristotle's position that qualitative differences are brought about by the com- bination of contraries, whereas Gersonides views them as caused by the dominance of one contrary over the other. He develops Aristotle's view that there are natural places for the sublunar elements, whereas Gersonides rejects the notion of natur- al place and therefore does not use it to explain natural motion. He accepts the lim- itations on geometry required by Aristotle's cosmology, whereas Gersonides ac- cords greater autonomy to the geometer. Yet, paradoxically, the very arguments that Ha-Penini uses to defend some Aristotelian positions often lead him to oppose oth- ers. He is particularly enamored of using the category of quality to explain many of the physical phenomena under discussion-what the editor calls his "qualita- tive reduction." As for Gersonides, the picture of a bold and iconoclastic philoso- pher that emerges from these treatises is consistent with what we know to have been his intellectual persona, as well as his reputation among his contemporaries. 365</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review His deviations from Averroes aroused as much controversy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as his deviations from traditional theology. Since many of the solutions proposed by Ha-Penini and Gersonides are not found in the writings of the Arab peripatetics, and since they occasionally re- semble scholastic solutions to similar problems, the question of scholastic influ- ence naturally arises. Glasner divides this into three questions: Were our protag- onists personally familiar with scholastic intellectual life? Was their method of philosophical controversy somehow influenced by scholastic academic practices, such as formal disputations? and, Were their positions influenced by contempo- rary scholastic discussions? With regard to the first question, she claims that it is impossible to give a clear answer, although she does cite evidence of contacts be- tween both disputants and Christian sages, and notes that much communication during this period was oral. As for disputation and other academic practices con- sidered distinctly scholastic, she argues that they could have developed concur- rently among Jews and Christians as a result of the intensive study of Averroes' commentaries. With respect to the question of doctrinal influence, the editor generally is content to point out similarities and parallels. The one exception is the discussion of the increase and decrease of qualitative forms, where the two protagonists adopt positions that do not appear in Averroes but resemble positions in the scholastic debate over the intentio et remissioformarum; their very interest in the subject ap- pears to indicate awareness of scholastic positions, according to the editor. Yet, such arguments do not convince this reviewer, because both scholastic and Jewish discussions of the topic arise naturally from a consideration of the issues found in Averroes, even not explicitly. Perhaps instead of looking for direct or indirect in- fluence of scholastic doctrines on fourteenth-century Provencal Jewish philoso- phy, scholars should concentrate on examining the parallel traditions of Averroes' commentary, traditions in which Jewish and Christian scholars, independently of each other, developed similar solutions to textual and doctrinal problems. Of course, further investigation in both traditions, especially in the primary sources of the scholastic tradition, will doubtless shed light on this matter. The highly speculative question of scholastic influence occupies only a small fraction of the discussion, which focuses on the issues and implications of the con- troversy. Readers unfamiliar with medieval physics need not be deterred from read- ing this book. The editor provides lucid and illuminating discussions, synopses and explications, and substantive annotations to Ha-Penini's text, which is edited on the basis of the sole surviving manuscript. The result is that the text occupies only 66 of the book's 250 pages, with history, exegesis, and indices providing the rest. Although there is indeed a certain amount of editorial repetition, it can be justified by the difficulty and unfamiliarity of the subject. The same cannot be said for the editor's practice of providing modern Hebrew equivalents for medieval idioms; for example, naskim lekha for nodeh lekha, and afcalpi for lamrot. These glosses, ar- guably appropriate for popular versions of classical texts, are unnecessary in a scholarly edition. In sum, apart from their intrinsic interest for historians of science, these two treatises by Jedaiah ha-Penini provide a rare opportunity to view a scientific con- 366</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews troversy among prominent intellectuals during the golden age of Jewish science and philosophy. Thanks to Glasner, the view is crystal-clear. Charles H. Manekin University of Maryland College Park, Maryland</page></plain_text>
