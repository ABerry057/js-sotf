<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 26:2 (2002) THE MOTIF OF BLOOD AND PROCREATION IN FRANZ ROSENZWEIG by Haggai Dagan In a letter dated October 19, 1917, Franz Rosenzweig-the German Jewish philosopher considered by many to be one of the central Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century-writes the following: "I can definitely understand ... him [a common friend] being an antisemite for religious reasons.... [But] that he is an antisemite for racial reasons [Rassewegen]-I am very sorry [I cannot understand such a thing], because for him this is simply following the spirit of the times!"' Further on Rosenzweig criticizes the "scandal" of hatred of the Jews that is even found among Christians who became Jews (a distinction that emphasizes the ra- cial-and not religious-origins of this hatred.) That Rosenzweig made so sharp a distinction between religious antisemitism and racial antisemitism as early as 1917, and that he attributed the latter to "the spirit of the time," is interesting, but it is not our present concern. We are interest- ed, rather, in the fact that his thought, which roundly attacks racial antisemitism, itself characterizes Judaism as based upon blood and procreation. Rosenzweig's commentators have already discussed this, and they offer var- ious interpretations. Some of them attempt to obscure or minimize the importance of blood in Rosenzweig's thought as a whole. Others depict it as a shortcoming in his thinking but explain that, prior to the 1930s (Rosenzweig died in 1929), it was impossible to anticipate the sensitivity on matters of blood and race that would emerge and become so painful after the Second World War. Moreover, many Is- raeli scholars portray Rosenzweig as a modern Jewish thinker of lasting signifi- cance and therefore tend to downplay such problematic factors as blood, whereas others focus upon his opposition to Zionism, tending to judge all of his thought, including his "blood Judaism," from this perspective. By contrast, Rosenzweig scholars in Germany tend to obscure or even to ignore this aspect, because it would detract from their ability to see in him a bridge to Jewish-Christian dialogue, an "acceptable" option in Jewish theology indicative of the closeness between the two religions.2 In light of all this, there is good reason to reevaluate Rosenzweig's "blood Judaism," which stands out as exceptional in the milieu of post-Emancipa- tion German Jewish thought. 1.

See n. 24 below. 241</page><page sequence="2">Haggai Dagan The first indication of the weight that Rosenzweig attached to connections of blood and procreation appears in a diary entry from September 1, 1910 (when he was twenty-one years old), in which he praises the faith in immortality that exists by virtue of the continuity through offspring, by means of procreation.3 These ideas be- came more acute in another passage written four years later, on June 20, 1914. While it is true, writes Rosenzweig, that the concept of the election of the Jewish people has a historical origin, it is ultimately based upon "the naturalness of blood,"4 and thus we can apply it to the primordial creation.5 That is, since the election of Israel is rooted in blood, in the continuous chain of procreation, it is only natural to attribute it to something that has existed since the six days of creation, that is, to perceive it as ontic. In light of these statements, one may well ask how the chain of procreation among Jews differs from that among other peoples. An answer indicating that Jews do not intermarry with other nations would be surprising in light of Rosenzweig's immediate social environment: a milieu of liberal German Jews, assimilated and largely converted to Christianity (his two first cousins and his closest friends, Rudolph and Hans Ehrenberg, had all converted to Christianity), in which intermar- riage was common. This question receives what may be called a meta-historical re- sponse in Rosenzweig's central book, The Star of Redemption, but for the moment it remains unanswered, leaving us with the possibility (which is not explicitly for- mulated as such) that Judaism is based quite simply upon purity of race. Use of the term "race" here is not unreasonable, for in a letter to his parents dated September 11, 1916, Rosenzweig refers to the Jews as a "race" (Rasse) and even represents them as Semites, together with the Arabs, as opposed to the Aryan race (die Arischen).6 Rosenzweig was not the first Jewish thinker to portray Judaism as a biolog- ical or ethnic community. He was preceded in this by many medieval authors, from Judah Halevi (who greatly influenced Rosenzweig and whose poetry he translat- ed and explicated) through many of the Kabbalists. The latter emphasize the puri- ty, merit, and superiority of Israel over the other nations, its spiritual and heaven- ly origin and essence, as opposed to the impurity and corporeality of the other nations. The great challenge to this outlook was always the principled position of Jewish law toward proselytes. The willingness in principle to accept proselytes and to treat them, more or less, as equals placed a difficulty in the way of any racial and biological definition of Judaism. And indeed, Rosenzweig touches on this is- sue in a letter from November 7, 1916, stating that the "unity of the people allows the convert to enter the congregation of Israel, but does not allow him to really be- long to it (in an integral way)." The proselyte remains a symbolic embodiment of humanity in general, which will Judaize in the future, at the end of days-and this is the only justification for his existence and his status.7 In other words, the pros- 3.

One should remember that this letter is part of an extended correspondence with Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, a friend and interlocutor of Rosenzweig. Rosenstock, the son of Jewish par- ents who had converted, attempted to persuade Rosenzweig to convert to Christianity. After he failed to do so, the dialogue between them assumed a polemical and apologetic tone. 242</page><page sequence="3">The Motif of Blood and Procreation in Franz Rosenzweig elyte has no true place in the Jewish "here and now," because in terms of the here and now, Judaism is a closed unit. In the final analysis, this removes the ground from beneath the institution of conversion, giving it potential but not actual status. In this way Rosenzweig removes the primary stumbling block from his under- standing of blood, because the concept of the proselyte no longer precludes an eth- nic conception of Judaism. Rosenzweig affirms, in his own way, the halakhic rule that a Jew is anyone born to a Jewish mother. However, at this stage he gives this technically restrictive definition (from the halakhic viewpoint) the status of a substantive characteriza- tion of Judaism on a biological basis. Jews do not need a pope, he writes in No- vember 1916, because every Jew is his own pope, and this papacy takes place by means of birth.8 That is, the moment someone is born as a Jew, he is already a "complete Jew," and requires no authorization, approval, or external authority to confirm this. Blood and birth are sufficient. The tendency described thus far-fragmentary as it may be-may be de- scribed as an ethnization or biologization of Judaism. However, it must be em- phasized that this stage of Rosenzweig's thought preceeded his creation of a sys- tematic body of thought. His systematic thought first appeared after the First World War in the framework of The Star ofRedemption,9 which began with postcards sent home from the Macedonian front (where Rosenzweig served as a soldier in the German Army) during the same years in which some of the above-cited passages were written. In the framework of the philosophical outlook presented in The Star ofRedemption, Rosenzweig develops and expands the matter of blood, connecting it with other aspects of his teaching (which this is not the place to elaborate). In general, one may say that the concepts of ethnization and biologization were mod- ified in The Star and applied to something broader-existence. In the framework of this category, the word "blood" acquired a meaning that may be understood as a metaphor for a broader idea-existence. This move is reminiscent of the under- standing of "ontic" as "existential" in the thought of Martin Heidegger, who de- fines the Dasein as that by whose means (and by whose means alone) the Sein finds itself, so that ipsofacto the "is" (ontos) has no existence apart from particular ex- istence. Against this background, one finds an astonishing similarity between Hei- degger's tendency to see in the German people and language some sort of ultimate embodiment of existence, and Rosenzweig's tendency to see in the Jewish com- munity of blood a superior and ultimate form of existence that in practice embod- ies redemption in a non-redeemed world. The "we" of the Jewish community, which is meant to serve as a paradigm for the model of the redeemed community (thus Rosenzweig), exists by virtue of common blood, by whose means the life of the community has a substantive, firm basis.'0 This substantive "together" is what gives the entity known as "communi- 8.

Hallo (Boston: Beacon Press, 1972). 10. Stern, p. 332; Star, p. 299. The characterization of Judaism as an organic body from which it is impossible to separate oneself follows from the correspondence with Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. The conversion to Christianity of someone (such as Rosenstock) indicates that from the outset he was 243</page><page sequence="4">Haggai Dagan ty" power in the present, whereas a community among whose members there is no blood connection is based upon will and hope-that is, upon the future but not upon the present. Hence, that which for others pertains to the future is for the Jew- ish people already present.1" This continuity, rooted in blood, is first and foremost the responsibility of the woman, who gives birth, who gives life.12 Rosenzweig does not attempt to conceal this aspect of his thought in his book: "It [the people of Israel] does not have to hire the services of the spirit; the natural propagation of the body guarantees it eternity."'3 All this is stated explic- itly: The Jewish people does not rely upon the spirit, or upon its intellectual or eth- ical uniqueness, or upon one or another mental quality, or even upon tradition or culture, but only upon blood ties and natural procreation. This is at least the case with regard to this specific passage in The Star of Redemption. But when one "compares its chapters with one another," the picture is more complex. Rosen- zweig attributes great significance to culture and tradition, to ritual and to ways of thinking, even in the case of the uniqueness of the Jewish people. But this does not detract from the definitive nature of what was said above. Hence, one needs to ask, finally, on the assumption that he was not guided by racism, why Rosenzweig saw fit to emphasize the matter of blood so strongly. In the context in which these things are stated, blood serves as a metaphor for stability, non-dependence, being gathered in upon oneself. The people is gath- ered within its own existence and lives cut off from all that is not itself.14 To illus- trate how far Rosenzweig took these ideas we need only take notice of his letter to Hans Ehrenberg, in which he claimed that the redemption is delayed by the in- volvement of Jews in the world beyond what is minimally necessary. The meaning of redemption is that the Jew is cut off from the world that surrounds him. The Jew may only be involved in the world, writes Rosenzweig, when it identifies with God-but such identification is only possible outside of history.' not an integral part of this body, for if he really belonged to it, he would be unable to cut himself off from it. See R. Mayer, Franz Rosenzweig-einephilosophie der dialogischen Erfahrung (Munich: Ch. Kaiser Verlag, 1973), p. 40. 11. Elsewhere (Stern, p. 317; Star, p. 285), Rosenzweig says that "hope ... lives as a matter of blood-inheritance only in Jewish blood." But this is a hope that accompanies the anticipation of the fu- ture in the present, and not hope for a distant future. Hope for a distant future is a concept that involves an inherent contradiction, for only when the future, or some part of it, is present, is there reason for hope. 12. Stern, pp. 362-363; Star, pp. 325-326. 13. Stern, p. 332; Star, p. 299. 14. In the wake of this position, Emanuel Levinas creates a contrast that counterpoises, on the one hand, Hegelianism, which only gives meaning to a totality against which every particular (faith, existence, etc.) is an illusion, or something that draws its meaning from totality, and on the other hand, "Jewish subjectivity," which demands for itself a significance not dependent upon any whole. This Jew- ish stance is the selfsame demand for existence separate from the nations. It follows that Rosenzweig is not simply an alternative to Hegel but a Jewish alternative to him. By exploding the Hegelian com- plex, says Levinas, Rosenzweig allowed for authentic Jewish life that draws its significance from with- in itself and no longer needs an external source of meaning. See E. Levinas, "Zwischen zwei Welten," in Zeitgewinn-messianisches Denken nach Franz Rosenzweig, ed. G. Fuchs and H. H. Henrix (Frank- furt am Main: Knecht, 1987), pp. 60-64. 15. GS 1: 554-556. 244</page><page sequence="5">The Motif of Blood and Procreation in Franz Rosenzweig Whence does Rosenzweig derive this picture? Certainly not from the Jew- ish community of Kassel, his hometown, or from that of Berlin or Freiburg, where he studied, or from that of Frankfurt, where he lived after the war. These commu- nities were completely open and involved in the social and cultural life of their non- Jewish environment. It is more reasonable to assume that this picture was derived from the Polish Jewish communities through which he passed during the course of the First World War. He was greatly impressed by the "ingrown" Judaism of these Jews who had not been exposed to Enlightenment'6-the selfsame Ostjuden whom his own parents and their like among the liberal Jews of Germany viewed with contempt. One must also recall that his decision not to convert to Christianity (after initially deciding to do so) took place after visiting the Polish Jewish syna- gogue in Berlin on Yom Kippur in 1913. It was precisely this image of a closed Jewish community voluntarily cut off from its surroundings, in marked contrast to the image of the enlightened Jew of the school of Mendelssohn, that Rosenzweig adopted as the archetype for his model of a redeemed community. His objection to the Mendelssohnian tendency is clearly felt in his reaction to the essay "Jews and Germans" by Hermann Cohen,'7 who was, until the end of his life, an enthu- siastic devotee of active Jewish involvement in German culture. It may also have been expressed in his decision, following the war, to renounce an academic career (which had been offered to him by his mentor, Friedrich Meinecke) and devote himself to Jewish education in the framework of a school that he himself founded and that was intended only for the Jewish community of Frankfurt. This tendency toward self-enclosedness and encapsulation was, as men- tioned earlier, quite unusual in the context of Jewish thought in Germany during the modern era.18 However, one cannot claim that it had no basis in the Jewish ethos, certainly not if we remember the verse, "Lo, a people that dwells alone, and is not numbered among the nations" (Num 23:9). While this verse was uttered by Balaam, it became a central motif in the ethos of Jewish separatism, which also came to be understood, from a certain point in time, as an ethos of survival, in the 16. Mayer, Franz Rosenzweig, pp. 173-174; S. Moses, System and Revelation, trans. C. Tudani (Detroit: Wayne State University Press., 1992), p. 168. Moses (ibid., p. 204) claims that placing the Jew in a metahistorical light means ignoring the empirical life of the Jewish people and seeing it as a reli- gious entity alone. In light of what is said above, one may formulate this more precisely by saying that it is an ignoring of the empirical life of part of the people, while placing the life of the other part (that remains explicitly under the sign of separation) in a symbolic light. 17. Zweistromland, pp. 169-177. 18. Albeit folkist approaches that mix in the motif of blood were not so rare. Michal ben Naf- tali characterizes it as follows, in "Jewish Philosophy and the Holocaust" [Hebrew], Te 'oriah u-viqoret 4 (Autumn 1993), p. 63: "The acceptance of the folkish (Volkisch) terminology, which attributes to a people a natural-organic characteristic, by intellectual Zionist groups in Austria-Hungary and Germany, as well as in Eastern Europe (without direct German influence), testified to their devotion to the liber- al humanism of the generation of the parents. Jewish folkism, which boasted of the unity of the soul, spirit, and body, was free of exclusivist racist arrogance. The solidarity among 'Jewish souls' estab- lished by a shared land/blood/destiny was understood as a necessary prior step to general human sol- idarity." It seems to me that Rosenzweig's more moderate stance, which finds expression in The Star is closer to this characterization. However, his earlier stance, as expressed in the letters surveyed above, differs. 245</page><page sequence="6">Haggai Dagan sense of the preservation of the uniqueness of the people against the dangers of as- similation among other nations. This outlook finds striking expression in the re- jection of Hellenism and of Roman culture by the circles of the Pharisees and the Zealots. The Bar Kokhba rebellion, which involved the risk of physical destruction of the people, exemplifies the idea that survival in the sense of preserving religious uniqueness is preferable to survival in the simple physical sense. The ethos of the Ten Martyrs and of the ascetic teaching of Rabbi Akiva, which serves it as a kind of imprimatur, or of the story of such martyrs as The woman and her seven sons in the Second Book of Maccabees, gave an aura of heroism and sacrifice to the ethos of separatism. From this point on, that ethos will accompany the people on their way throughout the long exile. Even though self-sacrifice and death for the Sanctification of the Name were always the acts of a minority, they became the ba- sic stuff of myth-rather than the mass conversion to Christianity of the Jews of Spain and Portugal, Maimonides' Letter ofApostasy, or other expressions of mod- eration in the face of harsh historical reality. The motif of closedness in Rosenzweig differed from similar motifs that pre- ceded him in that his treatment lacked the heroic element. His is a closedness lack- ing in drama; it is quiet, uninterested in anything that surrounds it, without mis- sionary interest, and indifferent to the historical process.'9 While the process as a whole is directed toward these insulated Jews, they, so to speak, know nothing of this and do not wish to know anything about it. It is almost astonishing that such an idea could take on flesh and blood in the words of a "Mendelssohnian" German Jew. But here too, as is the case with most of Rosenzweig's central teachings (and first and foremost his denial of the Hegelian cognitive complex), the First World War and the accompanying crisis played a decisive role. However, the motif of blood as expressed in The Star reflects more than a re- action to the Mendelssohnian tendency; it also expresses a clear rejection of Ideal- ism based upon the spirit, as blood and body serve as a contrast to the spirit. But unlike the romanticist traditions and those that arose in reaction to the Enlighten- ment spirit in Germany and in France-traditions that drew a connection among blood, race,20 folk, and land-Rosenzweig distinguishes between blood and earth and creates a clear contrast between them: "We were the only ones who trusted in blood and abandoned the land."21 Thus, the motif of blood, in addition to being a 19. See W. Kluback, "The Conflict Between Hermann Cohen and Franz Rosenzweig," in Der Philosoph Franz Rosenzweig, ed. W Schmied-Kowarzik (Freiburg: Verlag Karl Alber, 1988), 2: 801- 802. The fact of the subject of separateness being so deeply rooted in the Jewish ethos was overlooked by W. Schmied-Kowarzik, who expresses surprise at the rejection of the doctrine of mission in Rosen- zweig's understanding of Judaism. See his Franz Rosenzweig-existenzielles Denken und Gelebte Be- wdhrung (Freiburg, 1991), p. 76 20. In one place Rosenzweig explicitly uses the term "race" (Rasse) in order to clarify the mean- ing of"people." See GS 3: 691. 21. Stern, p. 332; p. Star, 299. Rosenzweig is not always absolutely loyal to this distinction. He says that the woman is charged with this blood connection more than the man, because her roots are anchored in "the depths of nature" (Stern, p. 362; Star pp. 325-326). As such, it is she who "has this basis of Jewish life for her own." The man, by contrast, needs to study the Torah "deliberately over and over" for the essence of life. Elsewhere, he argues that a Jew does not even have to believe, for his very existence as a Jew is an act of faith (Stern, p. 380; Star, p. 342). 246</page><page sequence="7">The Motif of Blood and Procreation in Franz Rosenzweig negation of the centrality of the spirit (and, as such, a negation of the entire tradi- tion of Western thought), also becomes a negation of the national ethos in its usual territorial form, and especially of the Zionist ethos, which wished to actively restore the connection between the people and its land. The people, Rosenzweig claimed, was not founded on its soil, and its land is more a locus of longing than a place to live. Even when it does live there, it is only as a "stranger and sojourner in its land." The connection to the land means transience and death, while being embedded in the cycle of procreation and blood, in life alone, means eternity. Thus Rosenzweig can declare: "Among the peoples of the world, we were the only ones who separat- ed what lives within us from all community with what is dead."22 We "do not root in earth, and so we are eternal wanderers, but deeply rooted in our own body and blood."23 This is not an eternity beyond life, but one that flows from life itself; eter- nity that is none other than life itself or, to be more precise, the essence of life it- self, cut off from every extraneous thing associated with it (soil, spirit). And what is the essence of life itself if not procreation, if not blood, the fluid of life? This presentation allows us to interpret the motif of blood as it appears in The Star of Redemption. In The Star of Redemption, as against the impression ob- tained from the fragments that preceded it, one is not necessarily speaking of es- tablishing Judaism upon a narrow racial basis, or at least not on a racial basis alone, but upon blood as a symbol of life and of continuity. Blood thus assumes in The Star a metaphorical meaning that helps to bring out the uniqueness of the Jewish people as a people separates from other peoples in the manner of its existence and in terms of the ethos of its existence (and not necessarily in the purity of its stock). As a people connected to this essence alone, of a self-rooted existence, an exis- tence that has no more than its own "being" and no need for any more than this, living a life without land and language, the Jewish people cannot imagine a time when it will cease to exist.24 22. Stern, p. 332; Star, p. 299. 23. Stern, p. 338; Star, p. 305. 24. Ibid. The matter of blood likewise serves the unity of the people. Rosenzweig says that this unity, expressed in the motif of blood, is only symbolic, but nevertheless needs to be preserved as such. See S. Talmon, "Judentum und Christentum im Verstindnis Franz Rosenzweigs," in Offenbarung im Denken Franz Rosenzweigs (Essen: Ludegrus, 1979), p. 133, and the reference there. Concerning blood, cf. A.

The answer eliminates the possibil- ity of a racist interpretation of The Star of Redemption, or at least modifies it to "moderate racism": Not because Jewish blood is purer or substantively different from the blood of the other nations, but because the Jewish people lives the dy- namic of procreation and of self-rooting, and does not need (in principle) anything apart from that, whereas it is the nature of the other nations-especially the Chris- tian nations-"to turn outwards" toward the world, to influence and to be influ- enced. Nonetheless, in light of this substantive distinction, which has existed for thousands of years, there has been created a situation of substantive difference be- tween the Jewish people and the other nations, and this difference is existential and ontic. It is impossible to ignore this insight in Rosenzweig's thought. A few short years after Rosenzweig's death, the Jewish people underwent events that placed the entire concept of eternity in the context of blood in an al- most ludicrous light. Nevertheless, he cannot be legitimately criticized for not con- sidering the possibility that the people as a whole could simply be physically de- stroyed, for no one could have imagined any such possibility in those days. The discussion of the motif of blood and procreation has another aspect; the emphasis on self-ingrown existence means, for Rosenzweig, forgoing the necessi- ty of territory. This unique "net" existence does not require territory. Therefore, even if this position may be depicted as a kind of Jewish nationalism, it is not na- tionalism in the routine sense, which includes relationship to a territory as a pri- mary, or even fundamental, component of the national ethos. For Rosenzweig the opposite holds: He saw the exile as a necessary condition for the authentic exis- tence of the Jewish nation.25 In this he is no different from universalists like Her- mann Cohen, who idealized the exile and posed a universalism that implied for- going a homeland.26 But Cohen (like Emmanuel Levinas) bases Jewish existence and Eternity," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 2 (1942): 1-70; Moses, System and Reve- lation, pp. 179-180; S.

Gershom Scholem, "Jews and Germans," in On Jews and Judaism in Crisis (New York: Schocken, 1976), p. 89, commented on such matters in reaction to Margarete Susman's assertion that "the vocation of Israel as a people is not self-realization, but self-surrender for the sake of a higher, transhistoric goal." He says that it is blindness to demand such a thing in the name of the prophets, "who indeed did not wish Israel to be a people like all the other peoples." Scholem's comments are directed 248</page><page sequence="9">The Motif of Blood and Procreation in Franz Rosenzweig upon ethics. He plays down the importance of tribal belonging, of connection to soil, and of national identity. Cohen spoke of Germany as his true home, but the deeper significance of his thought is that feeling at home is a minor thing that the Jew ought to sacrifice for the sake of more elevated matters. Rosenzweig differs substantially from this tendency in that he emphasizes pure existence (as expressed in blood and propagation), which he places before ethics or reason. For Rosen- zweig the meaning of exile is not the sacrificing of a home; on the contrary: it is a paradoxical (or dialectical)27 precondition for having an ultimate home. Only by forgoing home, by forgoing homeland in the usual sense, does one acquire a home that is not dependent upon place, that is not concrete, like the shell that the snail carries on its back. This home is the essence of Jewish existence. Haggai Dagan Li-On, Israel against the distortion involved in the universalist interpretation of Judaism. "We are asked to believe ... that the 'original meaning of the Jewish idea is the absorption of this people by other peoples.' What is terrible about this statement is not that it has been so devastatingly refuted by history, but that it nev- er signified anything except a perversion whereby Christian ideas-rejected by Jews with their dying breath-now presented themselves as the demands of the greatest Jewish minds." 27. Paradoxically if we formulate it thus: "if not a home then a home"; dialectically if we read: "the negation of Home A allows in the next stage the attainment of Home B." 249</page></plain_text>
