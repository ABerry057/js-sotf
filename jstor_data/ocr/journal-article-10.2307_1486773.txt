<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frances Malino. A Jew in the French Revolution: The Life ofZalkind Hourwitz, Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1996. xx, 281 pp. Frances Malino, who has previously written about the Jews of Bordeaux, has found a fascinating individual, Zalkind Hourwitz, through whose life and letters she examines the condition of an ordinary eastern Jew living at the dawn of Jewish emancipation. Hourwitz, a Pole from Lublin, seems to have left all traces of kin behind to settle in the quartier Saint-Martin of Paris in 1774, where he remained until he died in 1812. He threw himself into the intellectual debate about the condition and future of the Jews of France when the Academy of Metz in Lorraine sponsored a contest in 1785 on the question: "Are there means of rendering Jews happier and more useful in France?" The three winners were announced in 1788. Hourwitz's Apologie des Juifs (1789) shared first prize with Claude Antoine Thiery and the abbe Henri Gr6goire. The latter's submission was entitled Essay on the Physical, Moral, and Political Regeneration of the Jews (1789). Hourwitz eschewed Gr6goire's approach, the title of which he found degrading to Jews. While fully aware of Voltaire and Rousseau's antisemitism, he preferred the enemy of his enemy (respectively Voltaire and Christianity) to Gr6goire's overt conversionism. But secular tolerance was not all Hourwitz wanted. His Apologie sought acceptance of Jews as fully equal citizens of France on no other basis than common humanity. While never elected to office, Hourwitz was an effective autodidact, author, and correspondent who lived through the exciting years of the</page><page sequence="2">402 BOOK REVIEWS Constituent Assembly to see, Bordeaux's Portuguese Jews given civic rights in 1789, and then the much greater landmark of 1791, when all Jews, the vast majority of them from eastern France, were given full civic equality. This meant the abolition of numerous things Hourwitz had deplored in his Apologie, such as property and residential restrictions as well as exclusion from many professions. Emancipation was opposed by the future director Jean-Frangois Reubell, for whom the indebtedness of the Alsatian peasantry to Jewish creditors was an insuperable obstacle. But it was ardently supported by another Alsatian legislator and editor, Pierre-Louis Roederer, who with Gr6goire and Mirabeau carried the day. Hourwitz was not granted political citizenship until 1800, ironically by the Napoleonic government that put an end to many of the liberties for which he had fought. It was the informal citizenship in the Republic of Letters, however, to which he aspired. He knew most of those who concerned themselves with the Jewish question, including Guillaume-Chr6tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, the former censor of Louis XV and minister and defender of Louis XVI. That Hourwitz, who had no family and no initial connections, who lived in a garret on the rue Saint-Denis and stereotypically sold used clothes to make a living when he was not employed as a Hebrew specialist at the Bibliothbque Nationale, could gain entry to such respectable circles shows the social fluidity of the revolutionary decade as well as the grit of Malino's protagonist. It is also a tribute to the power of the academies in the eighteenth century. Having received certain recognition from that of Metz, Hourwitz went on in the Directory to compete in an essay contest on a universal language organized by the newly created Institut National and chaired by Destutt de Tracy. Hourwitz had taught himself quite a few languages, and he devised an elaborate forerunner of Esperanto based on a Latin key. This led to the publication of three works: the Polygraphie of 1801, the Lacographie ou Ecriture laconique of 1811 and the Origine des langues (n.d.). The search for a universal language was a pair to the search for a universal citizenship (Hourwitz's friend, the Prussian-born Anacharsis Cloots, styled himself "the orator of the human race," and Charles Dupuis wrote a multivolume Origine de tous les cultes in 1795). Universality was the inseparable companion of fraternity and equality. Napoleon restored slavery in 1804, and in 1807 he summoned the Great Sanhedrin, which imposed "particular economic, geographical, and military restrictions" for all French Jews except the portugais (p. 185). No Jew could</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 403 settle in Alsace at all, nor in any other department without a rural property, and conscripts were obliged to do personal service. In spite of what Malino calls the reappearance of the discourse of the Old Regime, it was hoped that full assimilation would be achieved in ten years. Whether this would mean more mixed marriages or more Jewish cohesiveness was unclear. For Jews the question was how to remain Jewish while enjoying the "rights of man and the citizen." Marx, in On the Jewish Question (1843), would say that this was an impossible agenda. But Thiery asked: "Would the Jews be able to rule us?" (p. 53). While he thought not, the question seems anachronistically prescient. Malino has written a very easy-handed, graceful, and perceptive ac- count-neither hagiography nor pedestrian biography. Her research in archival and printed materials seems thorough and fruitful. The only gap seems to be the voluminous correspondence of Henri Gr6goire housed at the Biblioth que de Port Royal, which may keep more secrets.
