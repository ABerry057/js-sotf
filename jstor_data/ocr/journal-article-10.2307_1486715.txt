<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Bonfil. Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy. Translated by Anthony Oldcorn. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. xiii, 320 pp. Robert Bonfil's Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy is very important and significant, not only because it provides a fresh, exciting, and thoroughly researched study of an often-misunderstood period of Jewish history, but also because in this original book he offers a pioneering model of the application of the Annales mentalite model of history writing to the study of Jewish history. It wrestles with two equally stimulating questions: (1) To what extent was the history of the Jews in Italy different during the Renaissance than in the preceding Middle Ages? (2) How can the historian discover the describe the mentality of Jews who lived in different periods of history? These questions, for Bonfil, are more significant than the conventional question of the extent to which Italian culture of the Renaissance influenced the Jews, because for him this question assumes that these were two distinct cultures, and assumption he will not accept. The key to Bonfil's presentation is his idea of structures. Each section of the book attempts to present the structures of a different aspect of Jewish life in Italy. These included settlement and economy; culture and society; and mentality, in which he included time and space; sounds and silence; colors, tastes, and odors; the days of life, and death. Bonfil, like most historical writers who use the term, does not define what he means by structure, but his use of the term is significant and the implications can be compelling. Thus, he writes, although the Jews of Italy shared many ideas, social relations, and even sexual intimacies with their Christian neighbors, the gap between the two religions, cultures, or peoples was not reduced, but as two groups of people "living in the same historical context" they shared "natural communality of mental structures" (p. 152). One of the contributions of this view is to show that sharing structures with other peoples, common in Jewish history, is not the same as assimilation, despite many accusations among Jews to the contrary. Similarly, although Bonfils asserts that the categories of time and space were</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 407 perceived similarly by Jews and Christians, it was the Jewish religion that differentiated the Jewish perception, and not "essential differences between the Jews and other peoples" (p. 114). For Bonfil, therefore, these shared structures produced a Jewish mentality different in Italy than in other parts of the world at the same time and different during the Renaissance from what preceded it. Yet Halian Jews of the Renaissance period were no less Jewish than Jews in any other time or place. Bonfil offers a profound repudiation of long-standing concepts in Jewish historiography of"liberal"and "rationalistic" as a measure of how much a Jew was willing to "assimilate" into the contemporary culture, and "conservative" and "antirationalistic" as reflecting an attraction toward isolation and obscurantism in the traditional Jewish world. In particular he regularly singles out for strong criticism the writing of Cecil Roth, whose work on the Jews during the Renaissance is widely known. In addition to this methodological breakthrough in the writing of Jewish history, Bonfil's book contains many significant, surprising, well-researched, and well-argued observations about Jewish life in Italy. He undermines notions of Jewish economic necessity for Christian society, their extensive settlement in Italy, and their favorable relations with Christians. He shows carefully the factors that went into Jewish settlement and migration, including the fact that very few refugees from Spain reached Italy. The establishment of the ghetto, however, contrary to popular opinion, often represented an improvement in the position of the Jews, or at least a reluctance to expel them and a period of diminished accusations and violent persecutions. Bonfil does not document every assertion he makes, and the laconic style of his book often omits the kind of detail that would edify and intrigue Reanissance historians as well as general readers. In fact, while the organization of the book is logical and programmatic, the generalist may derive more benefit from Bonfil's stunning analysis by turning first to the second section of the book. Some of Bonfil's generalizations are unsupported and may in fact be unsupportable. I am not sure what his evidence is for claiming that there was no dialogue between Jews and Christian (p. 238). In my own work on Leon Modena, who never spelled his first name with an e at the end, there is much evidence for extensive dialogue at many levels between Jews and Christians. Other generalizations of this type include his assertion that there was no youth or adolescence in the premodern world (p. 255), that the bride ceased to be part of her parents' family (p. 257), that nobody married for love</page><page sequence="3">408 BOOK REVIEWS (p. 259), that educational structures inherited from preceding ages remained unaltered (p. 129), that study was more demanding than kitchen work (pp. 133-134), and that the degree of literacy of the Jewish public was high (p. 147). At times Bonfil's terminology can be complicated. He does not make a clear distinction between "form," "content," and "structure." He seems to make too much of a distinction at first between "sacred" and "profane"among the Jews. While one may disagree on minor matters, Bonfil's Jewish Life in Renais- sance Italy is a creative and innovative undertaking, a seminal work which shows the vast erudition and the methodological deliberations of one of the leading Jewish historians of this generation. Bonfil has succeeded in reading the history of the Jews of the Reanaissance in a new perspective, a perspective that will be applied to other periods of Jewish history. This is an important book, and its influence will be felt for a long time. Howard Adelman Smith College Northempton, Mass.</page></plain_text>
