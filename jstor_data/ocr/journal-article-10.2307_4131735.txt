Mosig-Walburg, Die friihen sasanidischen Konige als Vertreter und F6rderer der zarathus- trischen Religion (Frankfurt a. Main-Bern: Peter Lang, 1982); Gh. Gholi, The Idea oflran (Roma: Is- tituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1989), 129-74. The precise institutional framework of the Zoroastrian clergy at the commencement of the Sasanian era, its evolution in the course of the Sasanian era, and the relationship between religion and state in general has come under review of late. See, for example, Ph. Gignoux, "Church-State Relations in the Sasanian Period," Monarchies and So- cio-Religious Traditions in the Ancient Near East: Papers read at the 31st International Congress of Human Sciences in Asia and North Africa, ed. H.I.H. Prince T. Mikasa (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1984), 72-80. For a survey of the views, cf. K. Schippmann, Grundzige der Geschichte des sasani- dischen Reiches (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1990), 92-102. 2. Kudama ibn Ja' far (De Goeje, Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum, 6:234, 1. 15). 3. The cultural affinity of the Parthians to the Iranian peoples was great. This was not always believed. An over-emphasis on the "phil-hellenic" aspect of the Parthians from the earliest scholarship, (partly the result of a paucity of indigenous Parthian sources and partly of pro-classical prejudices), was compounded by the apparent efforts of the Sasanians to downplay the achievements of their fore- runners-as reflected in the literature associated with the Sasanians. For discussion of the phil-hellenic aspect see J. Wolski, "Sur le philhellenisme des Arsacides," Gerion 1, (1983) [1984]: 145-56. New sources on the Parthians have served to nuance the former appraisal. Cf. more recent surveys of Parthi- an history and society, such as K. Schippmann, Grundziige der parthischen Geschichte (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1980); A. D. H. Bivar, "The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids," in Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 3(1), The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods, ed. E.

Beer, The Babylonian Exilarchate in theArsacid 283</page><page sequence="2">Geoffrey Herman should have sufficed to lure a number of scholars into exploring various cross-cul- tural contacts between the two neighboring religious communities during this pe- riod. Until recently, however, scholarship has not been greatly drawn to this field,4 despite an exhaustive focus, of venerable antiquity, on the relationship between Is- rael and Persia in the biblical and Second Temple periods, including the Qumran library.5 Earlier generations of Jewish scholars with rabbinic training, influenced by the wave of studies on the subject, had, however, enthusiastically taken up the chal- lenge of exploring Persian influence and parallels in the Jewish sources, including, but not prioritizing, the Babylonian Talmud (henceforth, BT) in their efforts. One thinks of, in particular, Joshua Heschel Schorr,6 Alexander Kohut,7 and Isidor Scheftelowitz.8 Notwithstanding the provisos that the scientific study of rabbinic and Sassanian Periods (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 19762), 61; I. M. Gafni, The Jews ofBabylonia in the Talmudic Era, A Social and Cultural History (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center, 1990), 32 n. 67. This interpre- tation is, however, untenable; see my article, "The Story of Rav Kahana (BT Bava' Kamma' 117a-b) in Light of Armeno-Persian Sources," Irano-Judaica (forthcoming). 4. One suspects that the need to exercise competence in both fields has served as a major de- terrent for some, cf. the opening remarks by D. Sperber, "Bab Nahara," Iranica Antiqua 8 (1968): 70; and the comments by E. Spicehandler in his article, "-i-xT '- and xnrr''T x'r: Notes on Gentile Courts in Talmudic Babylonia," Hebrew Union College Annual 26 (1955): 335-39. 5. There is an enormous literature on this field. The following is a selection of some of more useful (recent) discussions on the topic: J. Duchesne-Guillemin, The Western Response to Zoroaster, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958); J. Barr, "The Question of Religious Influence: The Case of Zoroas- trianism, Judaism and Christianity," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 53, no. 2 (1985): 201-35; A Hultgird, "Das Judentum, in der hellenistisch-rdmischen Zeit und die iranische Religion- ein religionsgeschichtliches Problem," Aufstieg und Niedergang der rimischen Welt II 19, no. 1 (1979): 512-90; S. Shaked, "Iranian Influence on Judaism: First Century BCE to Second Century CE," in The Cambridge History ofJudaism, ed. WD. Davies and L. Finkelstein, Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1984), 308-25, bibliography: 441-42. S. Shaked, "Qumran and Iran," Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972): 433-46; R. N. Frye, "Qumran and Iran: The State of Studies," in Christianity, Ju- daism and Other Greco-Roman Cults, ed. J. Neusner, Vol. 3 (Leiden, E.J. Brill, 1975), 167-73. We shall not address the issue of the alleged religious relationship between early Persian religion and biblical and later Jewish religion. Nevertheless, it should be said that the ease with which scholars can advo- cate Persian influence on essentially Judean communities whose contacts with Persians were rather ten- uous, whilst essentially ignoring their Babylonian coreligionists is striking. The predicament of intermediacy, especially acute for the later Second Temple period, has not gone unnoticed. Babylonian Jewry has, often, but without significant provision of evidence, been evoked as the prime candidate for this alleged transmission of Persian ideas to Palestinian minds. See, for example, the remarks by Hult- gard, "Das Judenthum," 516. 6. See Y. H. Schorr's (Hebrew) studies in the journal He-haluz 7 (1865): 1-88; 8 (1869): 1- 120.

Evidently there is much to be done before a comprehensive examination, or even a satisfactory sur- vey, of the impact of Persian culture, in all its aspects, on this Jewish community may be undertaken. This impact would have had many manifestations, and one need not expect them all to be directly acknowledged in the sources.10 The cases of explicit reference to each other in Jewish or Zoroastrian works are of rather lim- ited scope1" and this has led a number of scholars to underrate the degree of cross- cultural contact.12 However, the insular quality of this religious literature would Beitrag zur Methode der vergleichenden Religionsforschung," Monatsschriftfir Geschichte und Wis- senschafts des Judentums 65 (1921): 107-30. I have not encountered a further study entitled "Die Beziehungen der Juden zu den Persern" that Scheftelowitz promised in the above book (216 n. 2). M. Gaster, who reviewed his book (Journal of the RoyalAsiatic Society [1921]: 429-32), considered it as confirming his own approach to the subject, published as "Parsism in Judaism," in Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics 9 (Edinburgh, 1908-26): 637-40. Gaster's study is, however, among other things, less informed and more heavily apologetic. Another brief review, by B. Violet, published in Oriental- istische Literaturzeitung 25 (1922): 79-81, is laudatory. 9. This is particularly true with regard to Schorr. He set out to demonstrate the lack of origi- nality of rabbinic Judaism and its Persian provenance. See, in general, E. Spicehandler, "Joshua Hes- chel Schorr-The Mature Years," Hebrew Union College Annual 40-41 (1969-1970): 503-28.

It would, indeed, not be surprising to find various religious and other influences or borrowings dressed up, reformulat- ed, or otherwise judaized. Some areas of Jewish-Persian cross-cultural interaction during the Talmudic era have received more consistent scholarly attention whilst others only recently examined. The study of Persian loanwords has, on the whole, been one of the more for- tuitous fields. Studies by E. S. Rosenthal'3 and Spicehandler'4 with their empha- sis on the collation of the variants from good textual witnesses are examples of what is needed.15 The standard work is by the Hungarian philologist, Telegdi.16 Of signal importance are the brief lexicographical notes by B. Geiger on the words of reputed Persian origin, in Additamenta ad librum Aruch Completum Alexandri Ko- hut."7 More recently, Shaked has devoted a number of studies to Persian loanwords in Babylonian Aramaic,'8 and the new dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic by M. Sokoloff,'9 has expanded the field to include Persian loanwords from the wenn sie spdirlich vorkommen, aufeine unmittelbare Beriihrung zwischen Rabbinen und zoroastrischen Priestern hinweisen, bei der auch religi6se Fragen er6rtert worden sind." David Winston ("The Iranian Component in the Bible, Apocrypha, and Qumran: A Review of the Evidence," History of Religions 5 [1965-66]: 183-216, esp. 186) finds the difficulty of dating the Zoroastrian sources prohibitive with respect to examining their relationship with the rabbinic material, preferring to consider the Hellenis- tic and later Jewish material, much of Palestinian provenance. 13.

On his contributions to the Arukh see the introduction by Krauss, Additamenta, iv-v. His entries are a corrective to Kohut's earlier efforts. Kohut had been a little too enthusiastic in his quest for Persian loanwords, see the crit- icism by W Bacher, "Kohut's Aruch completum," Zeitschrift der Deutschen morganlandische Ges- selschaft 47 (1893): 487-514.

The magic bowls from this region, discovered in the hundreds, are our principle primary source for Babylonian Jewish attitudes to magic practices-to which the BT must, perforce, be relegated to a more ancillary role. They are also an important source on Jewish-Zoroastrian syncretistic tendencies in the period.20 The comparative study of Sasanian and Babylonian Talmudic legal dicta was hardly attempted in the past, a rare exception being the little known article by Her- bert Finkelscherer, "Zur Frage fremder Einfliisse auf das rabbinische Recht."21 There has surely been some resistance to examining this field in greater depth.22 It is now, however, becoming the subject of careful examination by Talmud schol- ar, Yaakov Elman.23 At the same time, Maria Macuch, an expert in Sasanian law, has devoted some studies to Sasanian legal terminology that is found in the BT.24 Among the future challenges, as already being pursued by Elman, will be the iden- tification of legal processes and principles, common to both Sasanian and Talmu- dic corpora that are not necessarily identified as such in the BT. A vital preliminary step is the careful and clear identification of those elements particular to the legal tradition of Babylonian Jewry. The scholar will need to seek out legal terminolo- gy, case formulation, hermeneutics, and so on, notwithstanding the external Ara- maic garb, that is paralleled in Sasanian jurisprudence.25 The existence of the law book of the Persian archbishop, Ye'ob6xt-a Syriac translation of a Middle-Per- sian original-will surely help in this endeavor.26 20.

An important exception-an article published more than twenty years ago by Daniel Sperber-served well to illustrate the advantages of such exploration for enrich- ing our understanding of the legendary parts of the BT.27 Discussing the story of Rav Kahana's experiences in the academy of Rabbi Yohanan in Palestine, he sum- moned evidence from both literary and material (artistic) sources of Persian prov- enance that provided vital contextual data. The comparative material helped to understand the development of the story and its date.28 Within the Rav Kahana sto- ry, the author had absorbed and naturalized Persian literary motifs, suggesting a marked degree of acculturation by the Babylonian Jewish author and prospective audience of the story. The Rav Kahana story is by no means unique. Next, I shall present two further instances of the assimilation of Persian elements in the aggadah of the BT. In the one case, Persian epic works dealing with kings are concerned; in the other, the Persian literature adduced is of a more religious quality, stemming from compositions reflecting a distinctly Zoroastrian outlook. ARDASIR, THE STABLE-MASTER OF ARDAVAN The legends surrounding the rise of ArdaTir I, the founder of the Sasanian dynasty, are told in a Pahlavi work entitled Kdrndmag -TArdahir Bdbagdn, "the book of the deeds of Arda-ir, son of B.bag."29 This work, generally believed to stem from Sasanian times,30 served as a source for later productions that chronicled the his- 27.

In one of the early scenes we hear that Ardasir excelled in his riding ability.32 After word of his equestrian skills reached the royal court, he was invited to accompany the nobles when hunting. During the hunt he entered into a dispute with the king's son that resulted in his demotion from the king's favor. He was sent to the stables33 and found himself a mere stable-hand for his sovereign, the Parthian king, Ardavan, and prohibited from riding at any time. Nevertheless he escaped from the king, revolted against him, and ultimately defeated and killed Ardavan in battle and became king. Later, in this account, he married Ardavan's daughter. Tabari's account of the rise of Ar- dasir also has him marry Ardavdin's daughter, although under different circum- stances than in the Karnamag version. Tabari, known to have made extensive use of earlier Persian sources for his history, states that Ardasir massacred every last one of the Arsacids, men and women, not sparing a single one of them. He then adds the following: "it is mentioned that he left no one alive except a maiden whom he had found in the royal palace. He was struck by her beauty and asked her-she was really the slaughtered king's daughter-about her origins. She stated that she was the handmaiden of one of the king's wives."34 He takes her as one of his con- cubines. Later, when pregnant she reveals her true status to him and the exciting adventure, which need not occupy us here, marches on. THE STABLE-MASTER IN PERSIAN AND TALMUDIC SOURCES The storyteller's decision to make Ardasir a stable-hand of the reigning king is neither incidental nor insignificant.35 Apparently, the stable-master was not a 31.

In a mid-third century monu- mental trilingual inscription on the Kacba-i Zardu't in Persia, relating, incidental- ly, among others, to the very same Ardahir of our story, his court officials are listed in order of importance. The title, ixwarrbed, "stable-master" appears as the twen- ty-sixth dignitary out of the total of thirty-one.36 Ardasir's successor, Sbibur I, who actually set up the monument, lists 66 of his own court dignitaries in the same in- scription but the stable-master does not even make his list. Hence, Arda-ir's posi- tion, working under such a dignitary, would be particularly ignoble. What is more significant is that the low status of the stable-master within the royal hierarchy ap- pears to have acquired for itself a somewhat proverbial place in contemporary Per- sian folklore. This may be adduced from a few sources in the BT. In B. Shabbat 113b, in an effort to impress on the audience the immense wealth that the Pales- tinian patriarch, Judah I, was alleged to have possessed, it is anonymously assert- ed that "Rabbi's stable-master was richer than King S.bir!"37 What is implied is that even the lowest member of Judah I's household was richer than Sabir.38 Judah I was, of course, no contemporary of any of the three Sasanian kings by the name of Sabjir. One suspects that the name Sabir became synonymous with "Persian king" for the early creators of the BT much in the same way as Caesar for the Romans and Xusr6 for the later Persians and Arabic historiography became Oaks Papers 23-24 (1969-70): 107-08.

This sense of the saying is lost in the secondary use of this source in B. Bava' Mezia' 85a, where the stable-master's wealth is a superfluous detail, unnecessary for the story told there. It does, however, give us an example of the rather predictable duties of the stable-master: feeding the animals. The explanation offered by the Tosafist in Bava' Mezia' loc. cit. stems from an attempt to read signif- icance into that detail, but cannot be accepted. 290</page><page sequence="9">Ahasuerus and Alexander: Two Parallels generic terms for king in their cultures.39 This might have evolved during the long and eventful reign of Sabur II, who ruled from 309-79 CE. It is not impossible to imagine that this Talmudic source might have been composed during this period. Of this S5bur in fact, a story is related in a contemporary source stemming from the northwestern frontiers of the Sasanian sphere of influence, which thoroughly corroborates our impressions of the proverbial humble station of the stable-master in the Iranian literary imagination. Whilst Arsak, the king of the Armenians,40 was visiting the Persian King of Kings and taking a stroll through the royal stables, the stable-master41 of King Sibir II audaciously insulted the Armenian king to his face. He called out: "You [there], king of Armenian goats, come sit on a bundle of grass!" In swift response, the Armenian sparapet,42 Vasak, who was accompany- ing the Armenian sovereign drew his sword and slew the stable-master on the spot in a spontaneous display of loyalty towards his Armenian lord. Sabjir, we are then told, however, did not seek vengeance for his loss, but declared his admiration and greatly extolled the subordinate's loyalty to his master. Devotion to one's lord is a value to be recognized and esteemed wherever it is found. Evidently the life of Siblir's stable-master, however, is portrayed here as quite expendable.43 39. Cf. Shevu'ot 6a. Only a few Sasanian kings are mentioned by name in the BT. Of the Ar- sacids, Ardavin, the last Arsacid ruler is mentioned once as a contemporary of Rab (B. 'Avodah Zarah 10b). He is also mentioned in the Palestinian Talmud, Y. Pe'ah, 1:1, 15d (cf. Bereshit Rabbah, 35, Theodor-Albeck: 333 [see the Apparat]) as a contemporary of Judah I. Lastly, a place near Pumbedita bears the name of one of the Parthian sovereigns by this name, see B. 'Eruvin 5 lb. The name of an- other Arsacid monarch, Vologeses, is preserved in the name of the city-port he founded not far from Ctesiphon, see B. Bava' Batra' 98a; B. Bava' Mezia'a' 73b; and possibly the Arsacid king, Vardln (Var- danes) lies behind the name of the city ',13rn (B. Sotah 10a) or xK3'r (B. 'Eruvin 49a). See T. N6ldeke, "Zur orientalischen Geographie," Zeitschrift der Deutschen morgenlandischen Gesselschaft 28 (1874): 100, n. 1. Of the Sasanian kings, there were basically 13 from the first until (including) Yazdgird I, the contemporary of Rav Ashi, but only six distinct names. The name Sablir is mentioned most, including a number of sources that would suite the first, and other sources, the second Sabir. Yazdgird I, who reigned from 399-420 CE, a contemporary of Rav Ashi, is mentioned, too (B. Zevahim 19a, B. Ketubot 61a-b). An obscure allusion to PNr6z (457-84 CE) appears in B. Hullin 62b. See B. Heller, "Persische K6nigsnamen in einem halachischen Merkspruch," Monatsschrift fir Geschichte und Wis- senschafts des Judentums 69 (1925): 448-449. The name Ardai~r appears in the name of cities found- ed by him, or in his honor, Weh-Ardailr (B. Gittin 6a, B. "Eruvin 57b, cf. also B. Yevamot 37b; B. Yoma 18b) and Hormizd-ArdaiTr (B. Bava' Batra' 52a), and also in a reference to a board game (B. Ketubot 61b). The late tradition associating the foundation of Hormizd-Ardagir to king Ohrmazd I (272-73 CE) is apparently in error. See J. Markwart, A Catalogue of the Provincial Capitals of Erdnshahr, (Pahlavi text, version, and commentary) (Roma, 1931), 19, ? 46, pp. 95-96) and R.

A stable-master plays a role, although not quite comparable to anything we have discussed, in leading the Achaemenid monarch, Darius, astray by a ruse during his 291</page><page sequence="10">Geoffrey Herman AHASUERUS, THE STABLE-MASTER OF BELSHAZZAR For our comparison with Ardasir there is, in fact, in the BT an even closer text. In the first chapter of the tractate Megillah select verses from the Book of Es- ther are analyzed. In B. Megillah 12b the discussion focuses on Vashti's refusal to appear before the king at his banquet. On learning of her refusal we hear as follows: "Therefore the king was very wroth, and his anger burned in him" (Esther 1:12). King Ahasuerus' response to her refusal is deemed disproportionate to the situation had she simply declined to come. The question is raised as to what message Vashti could have sent Ahasuerus to warrant this heated response. According to Rava, she sent him the following message: "Oh son of my Father's stable-master! Father would drink wine before a thousand (cf. Daniel 1:5) and was not satiated. Yet that man (i.e. Ahasuerus) was intoxicated with his wine."44 The insult here is multiple and reveals something of the way this story was being read by the Babylonian rabbis. There is the attack on his virility, as being incapable of holding his drink, so to speak. One is reminded of the renowned reference in Athenaeus that Darius had written on his tomb "I could drink much wine and bear it well."45 More significantly, perhaps, it is insinuated that Ahasuerus is not of royal blood but a usurper. He had been a ser- vant of the previous king who was Vashti's father. The citation from Daniel indi- cates that Vashti is considered the daughter of Belshazzar. In other words, Ahasuerus is a usurper who has married the daughter of the reigning monarch, the last king of the previous dynasty.46 Elsewhere the BT tells us that Ahasuerus himself killed the previous king, Belshazzar.47 Finally, Vashti calls him the son of the king's stable- master. From the context it is evident that this is a gross insult, but the source of such an insult is less clear. There is nothing, of course, in the biblical writings to suggest in the remotest way that Ahasuerus might have served in this capacity. Rather, it would appear that Rava is applying to the biblical story a popular calum- ny found in Persian tales about kings.48 This same calumny must have attached it- self to Ardakir as well. In the Persian equestrian culture, where riding one's mount expedition against the Eastern Sakas in 520-19 BCE, according to an account related by the second century CE Macedonian writer, Polyaenus, Strategemata (Melber edition, Leipzig, 1887), 324, which certainly reflects an earlier Persian source. One final reference to a stable-hand of King Sabir II ap- pears in a Christian chronicle, known as the Chronicle of Seert. cf. Histoire Nestorienne, Patrologia Orientalis, t. IV, f. 3, No. 17 (Chronique de S6ert), Part, I, (texte Arabe avec traduction franqaise) (Paris: A. Scher, 1907) [Editions Brepots, Turnhout/Belgique, 1971], 301. 44.

Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 4 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1947), 372-79. For a discussion on the rabbinic under- standing of the Persian Achaemenid kings see J.

Jellinek Bet ha-Midrash, 3rd ed.; repr. (Jerusalem: Wahrmann, 1967), 4, the BT is the earliest com- position to use it and appears to be the originator of this insult. In addition, the Latin title does not ap- pear to have borne the same stigma as the Sasanian, see the discussion, and for further references, E Segal, The Babylonian Esther Midrash, A Critical Commentary, 266-68. 292</page><page sequence="11">Ahasuerus and Alexander: Two Parallels meant everything, what could have been more denigrating and humiliating than al- leging that one of high rank had been no more than a stable-master? If this is the full significance of the stable-master motif, we also have the motive for revolt. Whilst the Kdrndmag account provides omens of Ardasr's future takeover, and the requisite Achaemenid lineage, no other cause is indicated. The personal insult in- flicted on Arda'ir justifies his rebellion against his master. This is a theme common to many stories of Persian provenance.49 In sum, here we have a Talmudic source elucidating a Persian one for us, helping us to fully appreciate Ardasir's degrada- tion, as implied in the Persian source we have cited. This allegation against ArdaTir would have made its appearance at an earlier date than the redaction of the current Kdrndmag version, for that version appears to be responding to it in some way. Thus, in addition to a mythical tale of the beginnings of the family, the Kdrndmag has also included a story of a hunt to explain how Ardasir found himself in the stables to be- gin with. Hence, it does not dispute this version of affairs but rather directs the read- er to understand that this was neither his rightful nor original state. Because it is highly unlikely that this motif traveled from the Jews to the Persians, as the Persian equestrian background would have provided the natural pasture for the conception of such a motif, it must be assumed that it was already current in Persian tales when it entered the BT passages we have mentioned. Rava, the only named authority in these Talmudic traditions, lived in the fourth century CE. This would provide us with an indication of the terminus ad quem for this Persian motif, which, at any rate, is many centuries earlier than the Kdrndmag version we possess. Accepting the hy- pothesized Persian origins of this motif we can observe in this case that when the creators of the BT wished to bring to life the biblical legends of ancient Persian kings (although not exclusively this topic) they drew inspiration from the popular Persian legends of their contemporary counterparts. WICKED ALEXANDER OF MACEDON We shall now consider a source that appears in B. Sukkah 51 b. Following an enthusiastic description of the greatness of Alexandrian Jewry during the late Sec- ond Temple period and perhaps a little beyond, a source for which there is a close parallel in the Tosefta and the Palestinian Talmudso we find the following curt re- mark attributed to the fourth-century Babylonian sage, Abaye: ?Il~~~n b~~~P~LK 1T~~~Ui71;71~151 And Alexander of Macedon killed them all. 49. Cf, also, two examples of this theme from the Arsacid era: the rise of Anilaeus and Asi- naeus in Josephus, Antiquities, 18:314-15; the rise of the Arsacids according to the account provid- ed by Arrian, cited by Photius, Bibb. Cod. 58: 17a, 23, and in a slightly abbreviated form by Syncellus: 539, 14. For the texts see: F. Jacoby, Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker II (Berlin, 1929): 858-59; Flavii Arriani, ed.

The Roman emperor at the time was Trajan, and this is the name we would expect to find here. Indeed, the Palestinian Talmud parallel attributes the destruction to Trajan.52 Hence, this saying attributed to Abaye is unexpected.53 What is surprising besides its gross in- accuracy is how this statement stands in stark contrast to the admirable reputation Alexander of Macedon enjoys in many other Jewish sources, from Josephus to the many other cases preserved in rabbinic literature.54 Awareness of this problem is far from new and discussion on the anomaly of this source, from an historical per- spective, has a venerable bibliography, dating back to the Renaissance era! It has been assumed to be a corrupt reading in one way or another. Various scholars have suggested corrections in the text on the basis of the Palestinian Talmud.55 This reading is however attested in all the manuscripts of the BT and in addition, graph- ically the two names are so different that this difference can hardly be attributed to a scribal error. It should therefore not be dismissed so quickly as a corruption. Var- ious alternative suggestions have been offered to account for Abaye's statement, which do not involve such major changes to the text. One direction was to assume confusion between Alexander of Macedon and a different Alexander. The famous exegete, Don Isaac Abravanel, in the introduction to his commentary on the Book of Kings, suggested that Abaye had in mind a later Roman emperor called Alexan- der. He suggested the emperor was Alexander Severus.56 This suggestion, howev- er, has nothing to commend it and was rightfully dismissed by Azariah de' Rossi.57 the Machon Hatalmud Hayisraeli Hashalem at Yad Harav Herzog in Jerusalem) are in basic agreement, the variations being negligible. 52.

It entails ignoring "of Macedon," contra- dicts the Palestinian Talmud's historically more credible text, replaces a major slaughter with a minor one (while many thousands of Jews are reputed to have been slaughtered in Tiberius Julius Alexander's suppression of the disturbances, it does not fit such a complete destruction), and besides all that, assumes the unlikely fact that the BT would have knowledge about chronologically and geographically dis- tant Alexandria concerning the lesser disturbance and not about the principle and slightly more recent destruction. If the BT versions reading Alexander of Macedon cannot be respectfully removed, they may, at least, be reasonably accounted for. It may be possible to ex- plain how this statement came about by comparison with the Zoroastrian tradi- tions. One should note that Alexander of Macedon had a totally different reputation in traditional Zoroastrian historiography than that which he enjoyed in the West. Ultimately, the Persian and Arab authors would succumb to the foreign influence of the Alexander-romance literature that had penetrated the East and would incor- porate him more favorably into their tradition, but this was a much later develop- ment.60 He was for traditional Zoroastrian texts the most hated mortal ever known to Zoroastrianism. Beyond the predictable grievance for conquering the ancient Persian Empire and supplanting the native Persian Achaemenid dynasty,61 the Zoroastrian sources also accredit him with the destruction of much of the Zoroas- trian religious tradition and the devastation of their country and cities.62 In Pahlavi ofthe Eyes, Azariah de 'Rossi, trans.

He is also associated in these texts, somewhat unexpectedly, with Egypt.63 The following lines, appearing in the Pahlavi composition, Ardd Wirdz Namag, should serve as a good example: Then the accursed Evil Spirit ... misled the accursed Alexander the Roman, resident of Egypt, and sent him to the land of Iran with great brutality and vi- olence and fear (?). He killed the Iranian ruler and destroyed and ruined the court and the sovereignty. That wicked, wretched, heretic, sinful, maleficent Alexander the Roman, resident of Egypt, took away and burnt those scriptures, namely all the Avesta and Zand ... He killed many of the high priests and the judges and Herbads and Mobads and the upholders of the religion and the able ones and the wise men of Iran.64 The cataclysmic destruction he allegedly brought about has a central place in the Zoroastrian writings on the history of the evolution and transmission of their reli- gious tradition.65 Thus, from the perspective of a subject of the Sasanian empire, the author of the words attributed in the BT to Abaye may well have been familiar with, and, indeed, influenced by the Persian attitude towards Alexander of Mace- don, and it would not be so surprising to find him attributing to Alexander of Mace- don, the "accursed Alexander the Roman, resident of Egypt," an evil that the Romans inflicted on the illustrious and ancient Jewish community of Egypt.66 The Letter of Tansar, trans.

This work is generally considered to have been written in the late Sasanian era, but the beginning, including the section we are citing, may have been written after the Muslim invasion of Persia. Nevertheless, the attitude to Alexander of Macedon portrayed here reflects the earlier period, see the following note. 65. Elias Bickerman, for example, in "The Seleucids and the Achaemenids," La Persia e il Mon- do Greco-Romano (Roma: Accademia Nationale dei Lincei, 1966), 15, assumes these anti-Alexander traditions to have developed during the Sasanian period. For a view conceding to these Pahlavi traditions a certain historical veracity see Mary Boyce, A History ofZoroastrianism, 2 (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1982), 290; and M. Boyce and F. Grenet, A History ofZoroastrianism, 3 (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1991), 12-17. 66. On the possible connection between Zoroastrian traditions on the loss of their holy scrip- tures by Alexander the Great, and early traditions on the loss of the Jewish holy writings, see S.

In the case of the Esther source, it seems that the BT has taken a typical Persian topos and applied it to the biblical retelling portraying the biblical protagonists as characters familiar from such as the Iranian Xwaddy-ndmag (Book of Lords) tra- dition. Familiarity with some Persian original should be taken for granted. For the source on Alexander of Macedon, it would appear that the impact of the Zoroas- trian antagonism towards Alexander lies behind the BT's attribution of the de- struction of Alexandrian Jewry to him. As for the conduit for this activity, it is unnecessary to posit a Babylonian Jewish community well read in the Middle Per- sian literature of the kind where such themes abound. In fact, probably few Per- sians were. Rather, one suspects that the transfer of these themes was facilitated by the largely oral character of the Persian literature.67 Jews would probably have been exposed to works of this genre, the popular literature of the ruling nation. As we have seen, the identification of these cultural exchanges serves not only to en- rich the Talmudic palette, but may also contribute towards a better understanding of the Persian sources, themselves.

The manner by which oral traditions were transmitted is considered by Mary Boyce, "The Parthian G6sin and Iranian Minstrel Tradition," Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1957): 10-45. 297</page></plain_text>
