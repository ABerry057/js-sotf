New York: Matthew Bender, 1999. xxiv, 746 pp., Glossary, Table of Authorities, Table of Cases, Index. Jewish Law (Mishpat Ivri): Cases and Materials is a comprehensive and lu- cid analysis of Jewish law as it is used in the Israeli Supreme Court as part of Is- raeli secular law, exhaustively detailed and clearly written. It is designed to be used as an American law school textbook and is published by a law school publishing house-Matthew Bender-as part of its casebook series. The book begins with two questions: "How is it possible that a legal system bereft of territory and police power has not only persevered but flourished? Whence do the Jewish legal au- 131</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review thorities derive their tradition-embedded answers to what appear to be novel, con- temporary questions?" The book seeks to answer these queries with an exposition on the nature and purpose of Jewish law, followed by a chapter-by-chapter inte- gration of the uses of Jewish law into Israeli secular law. The book is divided into five parts. The first two provide the essential struc- ture and decision-making process of Jewish law (halakhah), as well as its ethical underpinnings. Parts Three through Five explore a small number of legal topics that arise in Jewish and secular law and the relevant texts for each. All of the chap- ters in each part have a series of notes at the end containing leading questions and information for further discussion or study. Part One, entitled "Basic Characteristics of Jewish Law," clarifies how ha- lakha operates with respect to both "civil" and "religious" law. The authors point out that a sharp, modernistic divide between these types of law is not necessarily helpful in understanding Jewish law, where the lines of distinction are less clear. Elements of civil law like agency are present in matters of Jewish ritual law such as the slaughtering of sacrifices. Hence, a proper understanding of halakha must carry with it an appreciation for the interrelated nature of the civil and the reli- gious. The book also uses this opening section to establish the absolute authority of the halakhic process (such that even God accepts it) and to explore the gap be- tween law and ethics, remarking that a hallmark quality of Jewish law is its attempt to "juridify" ethics and morals whenever possible. In Part Two, "The System of Jewish Law," the book enumerates the legal sources of halakha and how these are used to render decisions in Jewish law. The authors identify six such sources, with the Torah as their touchstone: tradition (kab- balah), interpretation (midrash), legislation (takkanah and gezerah), custom (min- hag), case or incident (ma 'aseh), and legal reasoning (sevarah). The first is de- scribed as static; however, the other five are "inherently dynamic, and in fact a significant aspect of their function is to continue the creativity and development of Jewish law" (p. 62). The authors then analyze each legal source, using textual examples of its methodology. Parts Three through Five investigate a variety of legal topics, focusing heav- ily on human rights (Part Four) and bioethics (Part Five). The chapters therein share the same basic structure: The book explores the relevant halakhic texts on the sub- ject in question, then proceeds to (secular) Israeli court cases on the same where Justice Elon's opinions examine Jewish law's view of the particular matter. Each chapter is crafted to display how halakha-a "religious" form of law-impacts on or relates to Israeli "civil" matters, be it property, contracts, or evidence. With some topics the need for a morally grounded form of law is more obvious-abortion and capital punishment are two such examples-but the book does an excellent job demonstrating that Jewish law can-and does-have a voice on nearly every imag- inable legal subject. This casebook synthesizes mishpat ivri (Jewish law as it is used in Israel) with secular Israeli law. It is a very good-indeed, excellent-syn- thesis of Israeli law and mishpat ivri. This summary of the book thus far has not addressed a crucial question: Is this work a successful casebook for an American law student? Defining what 132</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews exactly is a successful casebook for American law schools is no easy feat. Essen- tially, these writers sense that a successful casebook in any discipline taught in American law schools (which is not in an area of law obviously relevant to stu- dents) must seek to accomplish three difficult tasks. First, a casebook must seek to explain to students why this area of study should be relevant to them. Thus, a casebook teaching Jewish law, or space law, or law and literary fiction, must court the student's interest in ways that constitutional law, securities law, and property law need not. Second, a casebook must compare and contrast that which it wishes to teach with that which it expects the students already to know. Thus, when teach- ing Russian law to American law students one tends to compare Russian law to American law, as the compare-and-contrast process eases the pedagogic burdens. Third, a casebook should choose to present topics within its field for which Amer- ican law students have a natural instinct because of their legal training, and natur- al questions about because of the flow of American law. Thus, when teaching Jew- ish law one should select topics that appeal to the natural curiosity of American law students, focusing on areas where American law is weakest, or where Jewish law speaks to the American legal mind or culture. This question, a matter of pedagogy concerning what exactly a course enti- tled "Jewish Law" (or perhaps "Mishpat Ivri"?) should aim to teach, is a complex one that is worthy of greater discussion. Book reviewers, however, should not ask, "Why did the authors of this book not write the book following the pedagogic method that I wanted?" and thus discussions of methodology for teaching Jewish law in America will have to wait for some other forum. In sum, this book, whose lead author, Justice Menachem Elon, is the senior scholar of mishpat ivri in Israel, is a brilliant work with thoughtful notes designed to address the use of mishpat ivri in contemporary Israeli law. It is a sign of the strength in the field that there is now a casebook in mishpat ivri in English. Hope- fully this will open the gates for many other casebooks and teaching aids for Jew- ish law in American Universities. Michael J.
