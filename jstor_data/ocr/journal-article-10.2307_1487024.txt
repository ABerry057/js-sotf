Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1990. 238 pp. Aaron Berman's Nazism: The Jews and American Zionism, 1933-1948 is a well-organized and cogently presented study which effectively employs a mix of archival materials, published primary sources, monographs, and scholarly articles to explore the travail of American Zionists and some of their European counterparts in trying times. Those who desire an exclusive- ly heroic or laudatory review of American Zionism will have to look else- where; this examination is refreshingly hard-bitten and realistic, focusing on pragmatic leaders who achieved much but in so doing made decisions of debatable wisdom, sacrificed helpless tens of thousands they might have saved, and, personally, paid a high emotional price for what the author optimistically calls "triumph." The book discerns a dual theme: as the world situation altered in the thirties and forties, necessary leadership and tactical adaptations occurred within the American Zionist movement. According to Berman, these changes organized and directed American Zionism in crucial ways, since the movement had been diffuse and drifting in the previous decade, ostensibly the creature of a more determined, better-informed, and deeply committed European Zionist leadership. Nevertheless, American Zionism did have its strengths; world Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann willingly admitted this, especially following the 1927 Palestine economic depression. In the absence of a systematic ideology encompassing a wide spectrum of interested Jewish opinion, these strengths would probably be deemed financial rather than theoretical. But they were formidable. Non- and anti-Zionists in Reform Judaism, who distrusted Weizmann's seeming particularism, responded positively to the less threatening and more familiar Jeffersonian formulas of</page><page sequence="2">114 BOOK REVIEWS Louis Brandeis, Stephen Wise, Robert Szold, Julian Mack, Felix Frank- furter, and Horace Kallen. With the rise of Adolf Hitler, American Zionist potential was gradually transformed into American Zionist reality. When European Zionists, through no fault of their own, scattered and emigrated, as those for whom European Zionists articulated historic positions fell silent, new American voices with relatively untested ideas seized upon events and, with strong hands, shaped a Jewish future for those who dared see one beyond the ghettos and charnel houses of Central and Eastern Europe. Who were these leaders? Berman states that by 1942 the torch had been passed. In the pre-1942 world, those who contended with each other were Weizmann and his American colleague Louis Lipsky, versus Louis Bran- deis, Stephen Wise, and, perhaps, Robert Szold. Readers will find it fascin- ating and frustrating to ponder the maneuverings of a movement tragically at odds with itself during an era when "crisis management" was imperative. Usually Weizmann had his way, with the important exception of the 1937 Peel partition plan, because the sort of diplomacy he was adept at was not yet pass6-European Jewry still existed to sustain his position-and Ameri- can involvement, despite its occasional flair and direct, public-appeal approach to government, was compromised by national isolation and popu- lar apathy. After 1942, when the Final Solution was revealed but not adequately publicized in the United States, the "providential" (p. 34) American moment arrived. The "new guard," in the process of "becoming" since 1936, seized its opportunity with a carefully crafted and sophisticated strategy. My personal preference is to view this process as minimally planned, more acci- dental and, in the long run, a victory by default, since European Jewry, excluding the Yishuv, was no longer in a position to protest. Be that as it may, the "aging lions" of Zionism continued to demand respect, but Weiz- mann had been virtually superseded by a European transplanted to Pales- tine, David Ben-Gurion; the vigorous younger Americans who spoke with decisiveness and authority were Abba Hillel Silver, Nahum Goldmann, Emanuel Neumann, and Solomon Goldman. No longer was refugeeism considered within a British mandatory context of providing mere temporary shelters to the abandoned. Instead, refugees became a rationale for defending a statist concept, often contemplated, but for various reasons never widely accepted by the prewar Zionist leadership. Thus, Silver, in particular, wielded a hammer whose driving force centered on activist diplomacy, nonreliance on Western Christian leaders no matter how well-meaning, termination of, rather than submission to, British White</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 115 Papers, and purposeful immigration. Problematic then and now was his "anvil," masses of European Jews who were jettisoned for the purpose of saving future generations in a Jewish state (pp. 114-116, 119). In his defense, Silver firmly believed that ending the millennial concept of "home- lessness" would forever put anti-Semitism to rest. He further believed that dealing with the Arab population of Palestine had to wait, since time was of the essence, though he publicly defined Jewish statehood as potentially beneficial to a resident Arab minority. As a matter of fact, an important element of his unity campaign was to bludgeon out of existence a diversity of ideas that Zionism could ill afford, from Peter Bergson's Emergency Com- mittee to Save the Jewish People of Europe to binationalism, the flirtation of several knowledgeable Jewish spokespeople, including Martin Buber, Henrietta Szold, and Judah Magnes. The shift from refugeeism supported by diplomacy to statism supported by a vast, coordinated immigration rang the curtain down on an era of European Zionism. Whether I would label it an American "victory," as Ber- man does, is moot. To my mind, that word is too "heady" and does not accurately capture the ambiguity of desperate decisions, roads not taken, and unspoken horrors. I would like to suggest "prevail" as an equally accu- rate but far more sensitive term which projects the idea that American Zion- ists did what they had to, but were by no means entirely likable or humane while doing it. At this time, history can neither fully judge nor justify Ameri- can Zionist actions taken on behalf of Jews during the Holocaust and short- ly thereafter. Undoubtedly, those yet to be born will advance the task we have begun. Stuart Knee College of Charleston Charleston, S.C.</page></plain_text>
