<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steve Mason. Flavius Josephus on the Pharisees: A Composition-Critical Study. Studia Post-Biblica, vol. 39. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1991. xvi, 424 pp. The body of this book is an exemplary application to the works of a classical writer of a technique developed by biblical critics. Steve Mason's unflinching and courageously single-minded use of "compositional criticism" to get at the meaning of Josephus's infrequent, ambiguous, and apparently self-contradictory comments about the Pharisees gives some indication of the state of German-style Bible scholarship, and should serve as a warning to those interested in adopting its techniques. Compositional criticism is, as Mason describes it, the attempt "to intepret an author's writings in and of themselves, as self-contained compositions. The narrative is assumed to contain within itself the keys to its own meaning" (p. 43); accordingly, Mason's method in making sense of Josephus's Pharisee passages is always "to look first within Josephus's writings for clues about the significance of his chosen words and phrases. His general usage and the immediate context will, so far as is possible, be the arbiters of meaning" (ibid.). Mason sees this exercise as serving two functions. (1) It is the first step in a revision of the history and reassessment of the significance of the Pharisees-to be conducted according to the strictest principles of historical empiricism: first the historian selects the "evidence," then engages in careful exegesis of it. By means of this exegesis, he will be able to discern the</page><page sequence="2">84 BOOK REVIEWS author's "motives and purposes" and "consider... how the original readership would plausibly have understood the document" (p. 13). The next step is to reconstruct the history. Earlier studies of the Pharisees have failed because they have not begun with rigorous exegesis of the sources. So Mason has chosen to keep first things first and restrict this book to exegesis. (2) Mason's first purpose is vitiated by its naive positivism, but his second one is more down-to-earth: he wishes to test what he calls the Smith-Neusner hypothesis, with the intention of disproving it. What is the Smith-Neusner hypothesis? In a popular essay published in 1956, Morton Smith argued that the then common notion that Pharisaism was the "normative" Judaism of the later Second Temple period is a mistake based mainly on claims about the Pharisees made or implied by the Talmud and Josephus. But the Talmud's history is a mixture of folktales and the wishful thinking of rabbis living centuries after the Destruction, and Josephus's claims about Pharisaic popularity are made in a few isolated passages in his later works (the later books of Antiquities, and Life, published twenty or twenty-five years after the Destruction), are not borne out by his narrative of the history of the Second Temple period, in which the Pharisees scarcely figure, and are best understood as attempts by Josephus to recommend the increasingly influential post-Destruction Pharisees to the Roman government. Smith's argument about Josephus was later expanded by Jacob Neusner, and in fact served as a cornerstone of the Neusnerian revolution. The "Smith-Neusner hypothesis" is at present enjoying a modest currency; Smith's larger points about the variety of first-century Judaism and the non-normative character of Pharisaism are widely accepted, at least north and west of the Litani River. So Mason's argument is intended to, and undoubtedly will, have an impact.1 Mason's book is divided into four large sections. The first is introductory, containing a survey of scholarship on Josephus and the Pharisees, some methodological reflections (see above), and a brief discussion of some general questions about Josephus's work, especially those pertaining to the character of Josephus's "authorship" (pp. 45-53). This is a critical issue for Mason, because compositional criticism, at least as he uses it, assumes that the literary work lying before us is in every respect the work of the person said 1. It is only fair to point out that the late Morton Smith was my teacher and I myself have argued in print for a (rather drastically modified) version of the Smith-Neusner hypothesis. Though it would not be entirely wrong to consider this review an act of hesed shel "emet, as it were, the problems with Mason's book are real.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 85 to have written it, and not a sometimes thoughtlessly produced pastiche of earlier material, or a piece of committee work produced by ghostwriters from a sketch or notes provided by the "author." Both techniques were common in antiquity, perhaps even more so than today. Josephus himself certainly composed the Jewish War with the help of assistants, and the later books of Antiquities are so incoherent that they often seem like the work of a pasticheur (and are sometimes thought to have been ghostwritten, too!), and Against Apion is almost certainly a pastiche. Mason's brief rejection of the significance of some of these facts (he does not consider the problems raised by War and Against Apion) is hardly satisfactory. However, some of the problems may be insoluble, and the decision simply to take a stand with the mainstream of Josephus scholarship on this issue, as Mason atypically does, is, if unpardonable, at least understandable. The remaining three sections are the body of the work. In these, Mason discusses each of Josephus's relevant works (War; Antiquities, and Life) separately and in chronological order-beginning in each case with a brief introductory chapter on the work discussed in the section, its date, purpose, etc., and then devoting a separate chapter to each passage on the Pharisees. In these sections, Mason is true to the method prescribed in the first section: the passages are understood in light of the literary corpus (i.e., all of Josephus's works)2 in which they appear. In practice, this means that Mason selects what he considers the most important words in the passage, checks them in the Josephus Concordance, and interprets the passage in light of what he finds. Mason reaches the following conclusion: all the Pharisee passages use typically Josephan vocabulary in typically Josephan ways; this means that Josephus himself is the "author" of all the Pharisee passages in his works-i.e., none was thoughtlessly cribbed from a source. In all his works, Josephus takes for granted Pharisaic dominance in pre-70 Palestinian religious life, and equally consistently expresses his regret about this; in fact, Josephus is consistently hostile to the Pharisees (so Smith-Neusner were wrong on all counts). The source of this hostility is the Pharisees' reputation for akribeia ("accuracy") and eusebeia ("piety"), which Josephus believes is undeserved. It is the priests-i.e., members of Josephus' own class-who are the true guardians of these. The writer also had personal feuds with individual 2. Mason's decision to interpret passages in War in light of data in Antiquities, Life, and Against Apion vitiates his conclusion about the unity of Josephus's oeuvre because it presupposes it. This is a major defect of the book, but limited space precludes full discussion.</page><page sequence="4">86 BOOK REVIEWS Pharisees. Thus, notwithstanding the common interpretation of Life, paragraph 12, Josephus was not himself a Pharisee. However, in the three passages in War and Antiquities in which Josephus describes the main Jewish sects of his day (the "schools" passages), he restrains his hostility and presents for the benefit of an uninformed pagan audience objective descriptions of what he considered the "official" varieties of Judaism, including Pharisaism. Finally, Josephus hated the Pharisees but approved of their ideals and many of their beliefs; his hostility was entirely personal. These conclusions, counterintuitive, self-contradictory, and simply wrong as many of them are, should serve to warn us against the assumption underlying Mason's book-that there exists one straight path to meaning, and that this path consists of the rigorous application of a single "methodology." The simplicity and apparent objectivity of this assumption constitutes its refutation, for the "meaning" of an ancient text can be found only at the point where a multiplicity of contexts-political, social, and economic conditions, literary and intellectual traditions, generic conventions, requirements of plot structure, grammar, syntax, and usage, etc.--converge, and even there only provisionally and tentatively. It is simply idle to believe that one can make sense of a literary artifact if only one studies its lexicon hard enough. Mason's interpretive self-restraint is impressive, and even moving in a way, but it is also a very bad idea. Not that compositional criticism is completely useless-no approach based on common sense is. Hence, there is much of value in Mason's book, especially in his discussions of the three "schools" passages mentioned above. His analyses of Josephus's comments about fate and immortality (which are the least methodologically pure and most wide-ranging sections in the book) seem to me definitive (pp. 132-170), and no one interested in ancient Jewish sectarianism can afford to miss Mason's comments on the crucial word hairesis, used in War 2.161 (pp. 125-128). In the rest of the book, though, Mason goes radically wrong, misled by the restrictions imposed by his choice of "methodology," by an apparently powerful desire for coherence, and at times by sheer intellectual perversity. Let me give just a few examples. The Pharisees play an important role in Josephus's historical narrative only in his two accounts, in War, book 1, and in Antiquities, book 13, of the reign of the Hasmonean queen Alexandra (76-67 B.C.E.). Both of these accounts are generally believed to be based on that of Nicolaus of Damascus, the court historian of Herod, in his General Histor,. As a rule, Antiquities, books 13-17, is</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 87 plausibly supposed to have reported more of the content of Nicolaus's work-and that more accurately-than the briefer War, books 1-2. In the case of Alexandra, the Antiquities account is longer and presents the Pharisees in a far harsher light than War (though Josephus mollified this in his evaluation of the queen's reign in Antiquities 13.430-432, by shifting all the blame for the catastrophic aftermath off the Pharisees and onto the queen herself; Mason misinterprets this passage). Hence, in War, Josephus has revised his source in favor of the Pharisees. Why? Mason, who has rejected a priori such standard techniques as source and redaction-criticism, cannot even ask the question, let alone answer it; in his chapter on the War passage he comes to the simultaneously banal and misleading conclusion that Josephus did not portray the Pharisees in a flattering light (pp. 110-113).3 Otherwise, the book is rife with cases of overinterpretation (Mason dislikes ambiguity: whenever Josephus says that the Pharisees are reputed to be the most accurate interpreters of the laws-a rhetorical tic resulting from Josephus's pretense to objectivity and used also of the Essenes [War 2.119]-Mason needs to determine whether Josephus thinks their reputation is true or false) and misinterpretation. He is right to insist that some of the stories in Antiquities about the Pharisees are uncomplimentary, and Josephus's failure to revise them is certainly noteworthy. And his insistence that Josephus never actually claimed to be a Pharisee is correct and salutary (though his interpretation of Life, paragraph 12, is otherwise surely wrong; given the context, Josephus is obviously expressing pride in his fellow-traveling, not confessing his ignominious submission to a bunch of thugs, as Mason argues [pp. 342-356]). But his interpretation of such obviously adulatory passages as Antiquities 18.15-17 as hostile is simply perverse (pp. 281-308), as is his argument that 13.289 ff. was mindlessly cribbed by Josephus from a pro-Pharisaic source-which may be true, but blatantly contradicts Mason's own exegetical principles (p. 229). Finally, Mason fails to confront one of the crucial arguments of Smith-Neusner: though Josephus claims in Antiquities (and only there) that the Pharisees were the most influential group and that Palestine was ungovernable without their cooperation, they play almost no 3. I should also point out that though he claims to be comprehensive, he actually fails to mention War 2.411, in which the leaders of the Pharisees are listed with the high priests and lay aristocrats as champions of the peace party. An acknowledgment of this passage might have modified Mason's belief that Josephus was always hostile to the Pharisees, In fact, in War, Josephus is indifferent to them, considering them at most a respectable and legitimate group of Jews of rather little significance.</page><page sequence="6">88 BOOK REVIEWS role in his narrative of Jewish political history except for the brief reign of Alexandra. In the final analysis, the simple version of Smith-Neusner is probably wrong; they did, after all, fail to explain why Josephus allowed so much of Nicolaus of Damascus's hostility to the Pharisees to stand in a work which was allegedly Pharisaic propaganda. But at least their theory was formulated with a keen awareness of the larger literary and historical questions. Mason's naive empiricism and methodological inflexibility prevent him from facing these issues and so from providing an adequate account of the peculiarities and incoherences of Josephus's work. Exegesis is an honorable occupation, and Mason does it with persistence and occasional brilliance. But the exegete also must look beyond the text before him, if only to make better sense of it.
