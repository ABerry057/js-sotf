<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Brenner. The Renaissance of Jewish Culture in Weimar Germany. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996. xi, 306 pp. That the Weimar Republic was the site of an enormous cultural explosion is a commonplace of twentieth-century European history. That Jews played an extremely important role in this explosion is also well known. What is not so well known, however, is that Weimar Germany also witnessed a renaissance of Jewish culture as German Jews tried to redefine their relationship to Germany's cultural tradition and their own Jewish heritage in the shadow of a cultural and intellectual revolution that was rapidly transforming the very fabric of European and German life, namely, modernism. It is to this enormously complex and deeply fascinating problem that Michael Brenner turns in his superb study, The Renaissance of Jewish Culture in Weimar Germany. From the outset Brenner seeks to correct the widespread misconception that Weimar Jewry's absorption in the tortured convulsions of Germany's national culture necessarily entailed a retreat from its own cultural heritage. What might have been true of their fathers and grandfathers was not, Brenner argues, always true of those Jews who rose to cultural prominence in the Weimar Republic. For while many Jewish intellectuals in the Weimar Republic experienced a profound and in many cases irreparable break with Judaism and Jewish culture, others-like Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, and Hermann Cohen, to mention only the most prominent-lamented that so little was left of their own cultural heritage and undertook a valiant campaign to preserve that which had survived and to restore that which had not been irretrievably lost. At the heart of this project lay what Brenner identifies as a longing for community, a longing no doubt accentuated by the fact that, no matter how much German Jews might identify with the symbols and values</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 285 of Germany's national culture, they always remained pariahs who never quite gained admittance into the Volk they had come to regard as their own. The strength of Brenner's book lies in its careful and detailed discussion of projects such as Rosenzweig's Lehrhaus movement, Eugen TAiubler's Academy for the Scientific Knowledge of Jewry, the Jiidisches Lexikon, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica. These ventures were all part of a concerted effort to raise the level of Jewish knowledge among German-speaking Jews and helped set the stage for what Brenner identifies as the Leitmotif of Weimar Jewish culture, namely, the dialectic between the quest for the authentic Jew and the Jewish embrace of modernism. Brenner first turns to literary texts such as Lion Feuchtwanger's Jiid Siif3 (1925), Jakob Wassermann's Der Fall Maurizius (1928), and Josef Roth's Das Spinnennetz (1923) not only to document the ambivalence that many German Jews felt about their own cultural heritage but also to examine the juxtaposition of the much-maligned Ostjude to the German Jew as an example of authentic Jewry. What Brenner aptly terms "the invention of the authentic Jew," however, stands in dialectical tension to the enthusiasm with which many of Weimar Jewry's most prominent intellectuals embraced cultural modernism. This embrace was perhaps most apparent in the field of music, where Heinrich Schalit and other Jewish composers tried to revitalize synagogue music by infusing it with the modernist idiom of Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Paul Hindemith. The search for a new mode of musical expression that was both authentically Jewish and inspired by the experimental techniques of the modernist movement reached its zenith with the inaugural performance of Schalit's much-acclaimed Eine Freitagabend Liturgie scarcely four months before Hitler's assumption of power. Even in the visual arts, where Jews were far from prominent, the curious amalgam of the Jewish quest for authenticity with the modernist idiom could be seen in the work of Ludwig Meidner and Jakob Steinhardt, most notably in the latter's Passover Haggadah of 1923. All of this, Brenner claims, bears dramatic testimony to the remarkable renaissance of Jewish culture in the Weimar Republic. Whether this might have been a reaction to the rise of political and racial antisemitism after World War I or whether it represented an internal dynamic that would have taken place regardless of the external circumstances in which German Jewry found itself is a question that remains essentially unanswered. By the same token, Brenner argues that the search for a more authentic Jewish culture in Weimar Germany placed a heavy strain on Jewish loyalties to the liberal parties that</page><page sequence="3">286 BOOK REVIEWS had championed the cause of Jewish emancipation, though without indicating whether this was part of the more general crisis of German liberalism in the postwar period or a response to specific developments within Germany's liberal establishment. At the same time, Brenner tends to overestimate the true extent and nature of Jewish disenchantment with German liberalism during the Weimar Republic. These blemishes, however, are relatively minor and do little to detract from the overall significance and merit of his book as a contribution to the existing body of secondary literature on the history of German Jewry. Brenner's study of the revival of Jewish culture in the Weimar Republic is an enormously erudite and carefully crafted work that succeeds in shedding light on an aspect of Weimar culture that up to now has failed to receive the serious scholarly attention it so richly deserves.
