<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHECKERED CAREER OF "JEW" KING: A STUDY IN ANGLO-JEWISH SOCIAL HISTORY by TODD M. ENDELMAN I Contemporary Jewish historiography has tended to ignore the private side of the struggle for Jewish integration into European society in the eight- eenth and nineteenth centuries. Instead, most work has concentrated on public efforts to achieve acceptance and respectability-programs to mod- ernize Jewish education, reform Jewish worship, normalize Jewish occupa- tions, and apply critical standards and methods to Jewish scholarship. In particular, historians have focused their attention on that small group of notables who managed the affairs of the organized Jewish community, that is, those wealthy Jews who everywhere directed the campaign for emancipa- tion and the modernization of Jewish life and later the defense of Judaism in the face of a renewed antisemitism. Needless to say, this group hardly con- stituted a majority of the community in any locality and in many places NOTE: I am grateful to the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture for funding this research and to Stephen Poppel, Jack Rakove, and Sheldon Rothblatt for offering many valuable com- ments and suggestions. 69</page><page sequence="2">70 TODD M. ENDELMAN probably not even a majority of the Jewish haute bourgeoisie. Yet many of these well-to-do Jews who took no active part in communal affairs were as eager as the communal notables to gain acceptance for themselves outside the Jewish community. Indeed, in most cases their ties to Judaism and the Jewish community were weaker; conversely, their desire for integration into non-Jewish spheres usually stronger. The efforts of well-to-do Jews to make their way into respectable Gen- tile circles weakened the cohesiveness of Jewish communal life and trans- formed the character of Jewish-Gentile relations. The impact of this social climbing did not depend, however, on the communal prominence or intel- lectual preeminence of those Jews seeking to abandon the world of their fathers. To non-Jews, the Jewishness of the Jewish parvenu was not mea- sured by the extent of his involvement in communal affairs of religious life. To limit, as Jacob Katz has done, the discussion of the origins of Jewish modernity to Jews who were self-consciously committed to the transforma- tion of tradition is to exclude from the history of this period all but a hand- ful of leaders and their close associates. Thus, for example, in his Jews and Freemasons in Europe, Katz decided that those Berlin Jews who joined masonic lodges as early as the 1760s and 1770s were marginal to his account because their names did not occur in the standard sources used by historians of the haskalah: "The Jewish names listed in the Masonic rosters of those days are not known to us from any other source. We must assume that, if they were not doubtful and unprincipled characters, like some mentioned before, they were at least unconventional persons who were anxious to find their way individually into the non-Jewish world."' Surely the encounter between Jew and non-Jew in Western and Central Europe occurred on a much broader stage than Katz and others have imagined. More than most European cities, Georgian London offered exceptional opportunities for advancement to "unconventional" Jews. There were few legal barriers to Jewish social and economic movement. The Jewish commu- nity exercised no police authority over individual Jews, since there was no organized community such as existed on the continent.2 London itself was the largest city in Europe, with a population of over 900,000 in 1800-almost 1.

Its complex and largely unregulated patterns of urban life allowed persons with ambition and drive much room for maneuvering. Social relations between various groups were not rigidly fixed but, within certain bounds, remarkably fluid. There were fortunes to be made, social heights to be scaled, sexual favors to be won. English landowners, the governing class, flocked to London to enjoy its pleasures and entertainments. Their hedonistic ethic of consumption and expenditure, as well as their healthy regard for the pursuit of wealth in a variety of fields (rural and urban real estate; mining, fisheries, timber; stocks and bonds), made London a haven for adventurers and climbers who knew how to satisfy aristocratic needs and exploit aristocratic weaknesses. John King-who was born Jacob Rey and known popularly as "Jew" King-was a notorious moneylender who flourished in the freewheeling atmosphere of late-Georgian London. He was not a communal notable but was, nevertheless, one of the most well-known Jews in London between 1780 and 1820. His career exhibited many outrageous features and cannot easily be fitted into the usual categories for discussing the dissolution of tra- ditional Jewish life and the integration of Jews into new spheres of activity. In one sense, however, his career is no less representative than that of Moses Mendelssohn, who was as unconventional in his own way as King was in his. Each moved in radically new directions-Mendelssohn in the realm of intellectual discourse, King in the sphere of concrete social relations. A com- prehensive picture of the entry of the Jews into European society must include the lives of the "Jew" Kings of history as much as the lives of the Moses Mendelssohns. The former are as instructive as the latter-if for no other reason than that there were many more Jewish parvenus and adven- turers than philosophers. II Jacob Rey was born around 1753, presumably in London, although he was possibly born abroad and came to England as a young child.3 His 3. The exact date of Jacob Rey's birth is unknown. According to Israel Solomons, Rey was admitted to the charity school of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in 1764 and was about eleven years old at the time. Notes and Queries, 10th ser. 9 (1908): 428. Solomons made this statement on the basis of a minute book of the charity school that was in his possession in 1908 and was sold subsequently to the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The library, however, has been unable to locate the minute book for me. In any case, a birth date of 1753 would fit well with other clues we have about his age at different dates. Thus, around 1804,</page><page sequence="4">72 TODD M. ENDELMAN father, Moses Rey, was a humble street trader, undoubtedly of North Afri- can or Gibraltarian origin, judging by the persona he affected to do busi- ness. According to one account, Moses Rey called himself "Sultan" and dressed in "Turkish" garb as he hawked cane-strings, condoms, sealing wax, and bawdy books in the streets and coffee houses of London. Another source described Moses as a "Turkish" Jew who had squandered his money in speculations and high living and consequently was forced to spend the last few years of his life traveling as a peddler in the countryside from Mon- day to Friday.4 Since Jewish hawkers of Gibraltarian and North African ori- gin commonly wore Levantine costume while hawking their wares, it seems likely that Moses Rey was part of this stream of Jewish migration to Eng- land.5 Moses Rey differed from the mass of Jewish street traders in England in one important respect: he was sufficiently "prosperous" to dispense with the potential earnings of his eleven year old son Jacob, who was thus allowed to continue his education into his adolescent years, an advantage which aided him in his later efforts to move in spheres of English society that were closed to most Jews. In 1764, Jacob Rey was admitted to the charity school of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews. Unlike the traditional Jewish schools of the Ashkenazim, this school offered instruction in both religious and secular subjects, with a marked emphasis on the latter. (For example, it was found in 1779 that most of the boys could not read even the daily service in Hebrew.6) When Jacob Rey left school in 1771, the wardens of the charity he wrote that he was "in the evening of his life"-i.e., about fifty years old if we assume that he was born around 1753.

As to the place of Jacob Rey's birth, there is a list of aliens in the Mansion House Sessions Book for 1796 (i.e., from the period of intense xenophobia and invasion hys- teria associated with the revolutionary wars on the Continent) that includes the name John Rey. [Vivian D. Lipman, "Sephardi and Other Jewish Immigrants in England in the Eighteenth Century," in Migration and Settlement: Proceedings of the Anglo-American Jewish Historical Conference... July 1970 (London, 1971), p. 61.] No address, occupation, age, or place of birth is indicated. Nor is there any reason to believe that King would have given his name in such a peculiar fashion-half-English and half-Spanish. Nevertheless, there is a small possibility that this John Rey indeed might have been the same person as John King. 4.

Within a few years of leaving school, he anglicized his name and was known thereafter as John King.' Since his Spanish name was hardly difficult to pronounce or spell, this decision probably represented a conscious effort to avoid the popular odium attached to Jews. Moreover, as it was common in mid-eighteenth- century England for stage Jews and other stereotyped Jewish characters to bear extravagant Spanish-like names, there was an additional incentive for Rey to rid himself of his Iberian-Jewish pedigree. Such name changes were not usual among the Jews of Georgian England, however. Even wealthy Sephardim who had severed their ties with the Jewish community, such as Samson Gideon, David Ricardo, and Manasseh Masseh Lopes, did not trouble to anglicize their names. Thus, Jacob Rey's decision to become John King should be seen as a self-conscious move to deemphasize his Jewish background. Young King's desire to succeed in life also led him to acquire a rudimen- tary knowledge of the law. After completing his clerkship in the City, he articled himself to an attorney for a short period.9 In the eighteenth century the attorney was a much despised figure; although his services were needed for almost all property transactions, his standing in the legal world was low. By placing himself in an attorney's office, King was not preparing for a legal career, but rather becoming familiar with those branches of the law that would be helpful to him in the career upon which he was to embark or possi- bly had embarked already-moneylending. From an attorney who was shrewd in money matters, King could learn much about mortgages, wills, and other kinds of property agreements. By the time he was twenty-one, King was active as a moneylender. The newly married Mary Robinson, the future mistress of the Prince of Wales, recalled in her memoirs that her husband frequently borrowed money from King just after their marriage, which took place sometime in late 1773 or 1774. "About this period I observed that Mr. Robinson had frequent visi- 7. Israel Solomons, Notes and Queries, 10th ser. 9 (1908): 428. 8.

Among others, Mr. King was a constant visitor." With much disdain she remarked that "the parlour of our house was almost as much frequented by Jews as though it had been their synagogue."'1 King's choice of a trade appears as puzzling at first. One would not expect to find a Jew, anxious for acceptance in social circles outside the Jew- ish community, seeking his fortune in so opprobrious a calling. The associa- tion of Jews with moneylending was hoary, dating back to the High Middle Ages, when it was the single most important economic pursuit in the Jewish communities of England, northern France, and Germany. Long after mon- eylending had ceased to play a critical role in the Ashkenazi economy, the myth of the Jew as grasping and usurious, hardhearted and hard-dealing, remained alive. Even in so commercially sophisticated a society as Georgian England, critics of the Jews continued to view them en bloc as usurers, sometimes literally but more often in the sense that they transferred the stan- dards of usury to other trades in which they had become active." This asso- ciation between Jewishness and a grasping, usurious sensibility was given expression in a quip attributed to Charles James Fox, a notoriously unsuc- cessful gambler who borrowed heavily from Jewish moneylenders. Thomas Townshend, so the story went, was talking with Fox and other parliamen- tary colleagues of the debates the preceding winter in the House of Com- mons and observed that "Fox had never been oftener on his legs in any one session. 'True,' answered Charles, who loved to joke on his own misfor- tunes, 'for the Jews left me not a chair to sit on.' "92 The attribution of a usurious outlook to Anglo-Jewry as a body reflected not only centuries of myth-making about the character of the Jew, but the persistence into the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries of Jewish involvement in the personal money trade.

The mania for gambling in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries sent scores of well connected young men in search of Jewish moneylenders. According to a censorious pamphlet of 1784, heavily capitalized, lavishly appointed gaming clubs "seduced" and "ruined" the young inexperienced gentleman, who, as a con- sequence, was introduced by older associates "to Jews, to annuity brokers, and to the long train of money lenders" who stood ready "to answer his pecuniary calls."'3 Charles James Fox, the Prince of Wales, the third Earl of Orford, and the fourth Earl of Sandwich were among the better known clients of Jewish moneylenders during the last decades of the century.14 Tho- mas Rowlandson's 1784 engraving "Money Lenders" presented two heavy- jowled Jews with thick dark features carefully examining documents being offered to them by an elegant young buck seated at his breakfast table."5 Much of the literature bewailing the passion for gambling fastened on the role of Jewish moneylenders in sustaining the mania. Captain Rees Howell 13. Andrew Steinmetz, The Gaming Table: Its Votaries and Victims, 2 vols. (London, 1870), 1: 113-17. According to Steinmetz, there were only half a dozen gaming houses in London in the 1780s but nearly fifty by 1820 (1: 122). This passion for gambling, it should be noted, was fueled by the agricultural prosperity of these years, which swelled the rent rolls of the gentry and aristocracy. 14. Endelman, The Jews of Georgian England, pp. 212-13. Fox was ?50,000 in debt before he came of age; in the winter of 1773-1774, his debts amounted to ?140,000; at his father's death later that year, they were over ? 154,000. He referred to the antechamber in his house in St. James's Place as the Jerusalem Chamber because it was so frequently filled with Jewish moneylenders. John W. Derry, Charles James Fox (London, 1972), p. 50; Steinmetz, The Gam- ing Table, 1: 309 and 316. A number of contemporary sources relate the following story regard- ing Fox's involvement with Jewish moneylenders. Charles's elder brother Stephen, heir to the title and property of their father Lord Holland, was in poor health and himself without an heir, so it was believed that Charles might succeed eventually to the title. This probability gave hope to Fox's creditors that they would be paid some day. When a son was born to Stephen, Charles was called out of the Jerusalem Chamber, where a number of his Jewish creditors were gath- ered, to be told the news. When he returned, the Jews noticed a look of disappointment on his face and exclaimed, "Vas is de matter? Vas is de matter, Master Fox?" "Bad enough, indeed," replied Charles, "here is a second Messiah come to plague you all." Walpole, Charles James Fox, pp. 28-29. The story also appears in Edward Gibbon, The Letters of Edward Gibbon, ed. J. E. Norton, 3 vols.

ENDELMAN Gronow, a Regency dandy and observer of London society, admitted that the "Hebrew moneylenders could not thrive if there were no borrowers: the gambler brings about his own ruin," but also shrewdly noted that "the mild- ness and civility with which the Christian in difficulties always addresses the moneyed Israelite contrast forcibly with the opprobrious epithets lavished on him when the day for settlement comes." Thomas Erskine, the future lord chancellor, suggested that to extinguish the gambling mania money- lending should be curbed: When the oil is spent, the lamp will go out of itself without an extinguisher; draw off the water from a man of war, and it is as great a victory as to blow her up or sink her. A gamester without his Jew is this very lamp without oil or this ship without water. ... 16 With moneylending viewed as disreputable and as "Jewish," why would John King, who presumably was eager to shed the taint of Jewishness, have made such a career choice? The answer may lie in the narrow range of opportunities open to a young Jew without capital and connections but with the ambition to rise above the place into which he had been born. Military, legal, clerical, and parliamentary careers, which frequently offered mobility to clever young men without the advantage of good birth, were closed to unconverted Jews, if not legally in every case, at least in practice. A mercan- tile career could not have held out much chance of rapid advancement, since King was not connected to any of the great Anglo-Jewish families engaged in overseas commerce. Moneylending, on the other hand, could be very lucrative if the lender was both shrewd and lucky. Moreover, there was a well established tradition in Anglo-Jewry of seeking one's livelihood in ways that respectable Englishmen considered peripheral to the economic well- being of the country. As a minority group only recently arrived in Britain, Jews gravitated to the periphery of well developed occupations and trades, establishing themselves in areas of the economy that were not dominated by native Englishmen, often on the fringes of social respectability or at least outside the mainstream of conventional routines and practices." Of course, the precise calculations that led King to become a moneylender can never be 16.

Whatever determined his choice, King rapidly left behind the world of hawkers and peddlers into which he had been born. In 1775, only a few years after setting out on his own, he sent ?100 to the trustees of the Sephardi charity school in gratitude for the benefits he had received,"8 and in the spring of 1776 (19 Iyyar, 5536), he married Sara, the daughter of Benjamin Nunes Lara and sister of Moses Nunes Lara, future benefactor of the Sephardi synagogue.19 Both accomplishments clearly indicate that King had become a man of substance, if not standing, within a short time. The lending transactions in which King engaged differed markedly from those pursued by government loan contractors such as Samson Gideon, Joseph Salvador, the Goldsmid brothers, and Nathan Rothschild. Lending money to dissolute womanizers and compulsive gamblers from the upper class was a high-risk, low-status business, plagued by uncertainties and irregularities. Georgian gentlemen were not known for their probity or fair play. The aristocratic ethos disdained money matters. Contracts were not to be taken seriously because money itself was a scornful subject. Cheating in sport, business, gambling, and family matters was widespread and boasted of openly. As the biographer of William Crockford, the upstart gambling house proprietor, remarked, "Gentlemen of the Georgian era were not sportsmen; they lied and cheated outrageously, . . . even an aristocrat would stoop to the lowest forms of trickery and downright dishonesty such as were practiced by the rogues who infested Newmarket Heath."20 King com- plained bitterly about young men just out of Eton who rapidly learned "all the mysteries of borrowing at high interest" and then just as quickly "the mode of cancelling the obligation afterwards." He thought that more money was made in one year by well-born "sharpers" who failed to meet their obli- gations than by Jewish and Christian usurers in ten. Charles James Fox he singled out as particularly untrustworthy, addressing him directly in a pam- phlet of 1783: "There is not an usurer in London, Jew or Gentile, but shud- 18.

ENDELMAN ders at your name; and the whole army of money-dealers fly at the first glance of your eye."2' In an era in which cheating was the norm, a young man without connec- tions, especially an outsider like a Jew, had to have sharp wits and a dull conscience to prosper. Debts were contracted in an atmosphere that encour- aged both borrower and lender to seek to exploit the weaknesses of each other. Honesty in such circumstances was a liability and an extravagance. In embracing fraudulence to secure his fortune, "Jew" King was doing no more than giving expression to the spirit of the age, or, to be more precise, to the standards of those circles with whom he did business. "Jew" King's conduct in money matters is known to us largely through the eyes of his enemies, and, thus, an accurate reconstruction of his manner of doing business is probably unattainable. Still, it is possible to describe some of the more characteristic lines along which he operated and to be rea- sonably sure that much of the notoriety and disrepute surrounding him was amply deserved, despite the tendency of the sources to exaggerate his wick- edness. (Not all of his moneylending activity could have been conducted on a fraudulent basis; had it been so, he could not have remained active in the trade for four decades.) Much of the time King functioned not as a moneylender, in the strict sense of the term, but as a money-broker, that is, as a middleman who nego- tiated loans for others, taking a fee for himself, without risking his own funds. Money-dealers like King existed because men of property wanted to 21. John King, Thoughts on the Difficulties and Distresses in which the Peace of 1783 Has Involved the People of England, 5th ed.

In 1789, the Prince and the Dukes of York and Clarence asked Abraham Goldsmid to raise money for them in Europe through his correspondents there. Simeon and Abraham Boas of the Hague agreed to advance them 350,000 guilders for twelve years at five percent interest, the loan to be repaid in four annual installments beginning December 1, 1801. The Boas brothers received the joint bond of the three princes, payable to them and vesting in them power of attorney to divide the security into shares of one thousand guilders each. The Boas brothers sold the entire bond. For two years, however, they received no money from the princes so that they had to pay the interest themselves to the shareholders out of fear that the credit of their house would suffer. Eventually they were forced to stop payment and became bankrupts. When French troops overran Hol- land in the winter of 1794-1795, they seized all of the Boases' property including the princes' bond. Soon after both Simeon and Abraham took their own lives. When the Prince of Wales again approached Goldsmid some time later to negotiate a loan for him on the Continent, he wisely declined.

Usury, it should be recalled, was regarded as contemptible and odious, a disagreeable calling associated with Jews.22 One further advantage of employing a money-broker was that it saved the lender the bother of seeking out those in need of financial assistance. A money-broker's expertise consisted, in large part, of his knowledge of and access to those circles most frequently in need of ready cash. In pursuit of his trade, King actively cultivated the acquaintance of high-living men and women of fashion. According to the Scourge, a somewhat sensational jour- nal devoted to exposing corruption, King first became familiar with Lon- don's haut monde at the time of his marriage when he met "many dissipated noblemen and ruined gamblers" among the visitors at his father-in-law's.23 Later, having prospered, he entertained lavishly and frequently at a number of homes he rented in London at different times. The Gentleman's Magazine noted in his obituary that "he lived in a very splendid style, keeping an open table everyday, to which such company were invited as were likely to prove profitable, either by wanting, or by lending, money on annuities." Indeed, so widespread was the belief that his hospitality was merely mercenary in moti- vation that the journalist John Taylor, a friend of King for over forty years, specifically denied the accusation in his memoirs: "From all I could observe of Mr. King, I had never the least reason to believe that any of his invita- tions were for pecuniary purposes."24 This defense of King's motives was beside the point: no money-broker eager to conduct business in the world of fashion could forego personal links with its denizens or do without the financial information about the great families that such ties brought with them. Money-brokers had to know about the rent-rolls, the mortgages, the debts, and the wills of their clients' families. In this regard, King himself admitted that from "the pecu- liar circumstances of my life, I had peculiar means of learning secret his- 22.

Between 1714 and 1833, the rate of interest was fixed by law at five percent, but, accord- ing to Jeremy Bentham, writing in 1787, nobody lent at that rate. The lowest usual rate, upon the very best security, was eight percent, with nine and ten percent even more common. Interest frequently went as high as thirteen and fourteen percent.

What Captain Gronow said of King's son Charles-a money- broker in his own right who was also known as "Jew" King-might equally be applied to the father: he "had made the peerage a complete study, knew the exact position of every one who was connected with a coronet, the value of their property, how deeply the estates were mortgaged, and what incum- brances weighted upon them." ("Jew" King the younger, it should be added, was also known for the excellent dinners he gave, both at his London house in Clarges Street and at his Thameside villa, Craven Cottage, at Fulham.25) King's money transactions were not limited, however, to the well-born and the well-connected. At various times he operated money-lending offices and advertised their services in the London press. Usually he did not con- duct this kind of business under his own name but arranged for others to act as fronts for him. Early in his career, for example, he opened an office in Three King Court, Lombard Street, under the name Messrs. John Dear and Company. As his name became known and his reputation spread, the need to hide his involvement in a venture behind a facade of Christian names and Christian clerks mounted. By the early 1780s, when his reputation had grown notorious, it was difficult for him to rent an office for his operations. On several occasions when it became known that he was the proprietor of a money-lending office, the firm had to close down.26 Although King resolutely maintained throughout his life that his reputa- tion had been unfairly blackened, there is considerable evidence to indicate that he took advantage of clients when the opportunity presented itself. One particularly well publicized case involved Joanna Southcott, the millenarian prophetess. In 1806, three of Southcott's chief disciples-William Sharp, Major Robert Eyre, and John Wilson-decided to borrow money to pro- mote her mission and turned to "Jew" King for help. They gave him bills of exchange, bearing their signatures, for over ?2000. King was to raise money for them on these bills by circulating them to third parties, but in the end he only provided a fraction of the sums they expected. King claimed that he had been instructed to raise the money at all risks and on any terms and that he had supplied them with money when they could not obtain it elsewhere. 25.

They claimed in their defense that they had never received true value on the bills and that they had been arrested on bills for which they had never received a penny. Whatever King's conduct, the Southcottians also seem to have been contemplating a little fraud of their own: in the trial it became known that they were expecting the coming of the millennium before the repayment of the bills was due!27 King acquired a reputation for unsavory financial dealings early in his career and never succeeded in losing it. He became entangled in numerous lawsuits stemming from his business ventures; his name appeared frequently in newspapers and journals, usually in an unflattering context. On two occa- sions, once in 1784 and again in 1802, he fled the country to avoid imprison- ment. On Christmas day, 1790, the Times described King, with heavy- handed sarcasm, as without any matter of doubt one of the most respectable characters in this country; and until the later attack on him, the breath of infamy never blew on his reputation. In all his dealings with mankind he has been the strict, upright, honest man. He never took advantage of the distresses of a fellow creature, in order to rob him of his property-he never exacted exorbitant interest for dis- counting a bill-he has justly paid every debt he contracted to the uttermost farthing, and in a domestic line of life has proved himself a fond-faithful- loving husband-a tender affectionate and praiseworthy parent, and a feeling steady and sincere friend. Chaste in all his actions-virtuous in every senti- ment-and unsullied in his reputation as a Man, a Money Lender, a Jew, and a Christian. Twenty years later the Scourge singled out "Jew" King and his son Charles as the most unscrupulous moneylenders in London. It believed "their influ- ence to be more extensive and their plans more dangerous than those of all the other money-lenders collectively." In 1824, Francis Place, the radical tailor, remembered "Jew" King as "an atrocious villain," claiming that if an account of his exploits were written no one would believe it: "It could not be believed that any man would ever have attempt [sic] to do many things which he did, without incurring punishments which would put it out of his 27.

A thinly veiled portrait of King in one of Pierce Egan's popular accounts of London high- and low-life, published in 1830, described him as "an old scoundrel-a swindler-a rogue-a money lending vagabond." Old Mordecai, as Egan called him, "was so strongly aimed at all points respecting the quirks, quibbles, and the chicanery of the law, that any connexion with him in money matters was truly ruinous. His plans were well laid-he was cold, systematic, deliberate." Indeed, his repu- tation was such that it was possible for a hack writer some years after his death to link King with the far more notorious fence, Ikey Solomons, an Ashkenazi Jew thirty-five years younger than King, whom King probably never had met, let alone had extensive business dealings with. Yet according to this chronicler of Ikey Solomons' exploits, King and Solomons joined forces for a time to defraud young noblemen in need of ready money.28 After all, was it not natural for one Jewish rogue to be in league with another? Amazingly, despite the notoriety that clung to King throughout the years, he never suffered from a shortage of clients. There were always young gentlemen in need of ready money who were willing to take their chances with him. In their eyes, he probably appeared no more dangerous than Lon- don's other money-dealers, and, in the last resort, they were often fortunate to find anyone, honest or otherwise, to advance them money. In addition, gullibility, naivete, and common stupidity also played a part in keeping King in business. As Francis Place noted in his autobiography, "It would not be believed that people could be found who were so foolish as to be imposed upon and robbed to the extent they were robbed by King, much less would it be believed that such persons abounded to the extent his prac- tice shewed they did." (Place himself refused to borrow money from King even when he desperately needed it and could obtain it nowhere else-"to have accepted any thing from him would have been downright baseness, so I remained in poverty, sometimes wanting food."29) 28.

That he was a Jew was well known. But that his Jewishness or his Judaism was the source of his roguery was not a cardinal tenet of any of his detractors. His origins were not held responsible for his immorality. Similarly, attacks on King did not degenerate into condemna- tions of Anglo-Jewry as a whole, nor did they call for the imposition of spe- cial laws to restrain Jews as a body, as had happened earlier in the century.30 Of course, King's carryings-on reinforced the popular image of the Jew as untrustworthy in money matters, but they did not provoke generalized dis- cussions of Jewish avarice or misanthropy. This may have been due, in part, to the relatively high degree of toleration already enjoyed by English Jews, at least in comparison to conditions on the Continent,31 and, in part, to the absence of a rigorous code of commercial ethics at many levels of society. In short, King may have been thought of as one rogue among many, his Jewishness as incidental to his shortcomings, or, at least, as not responsible for them. III "Jew" King's notoriety did not derive solely from his conduct in money matters. Equally offensive to many of his contemporaries was his ambition. The barriers between Jewish and Christian society having been relaxed, although not erased, King was not content to remain within the social boundaries of Anglo-Jewry and seek companionship and recognition there. English in his dress, speech, and tastes, he sought to make a place for him- self in a non-Jewish world far removed from the society of street-traders into which he had been born. In one sense, of course, all well-to-do Jews in this period were parvenus or the sons of parvenus. Some, like King, seemed inclined to break their ties to the Jewish community. Most were content to achieve a small measure of social integration into the non-Jewish world while maintaining their closest and most intimate ties with other Jews of similar wealth and acculturation. The single most significant step taken by King in his striving for integra- tion was the long-term liaison he established with Jane Isabella, Countess of Lanesborough, the only daughter of the first Earl of Belvedere, a Protestant 30.

ENDELMAN landowner with considerable estates in Ireland. Born in 1737, and thus about fifteen years the senior of "Jew" King, she was very beautiful as a young woman and had had many suitors, but, to please her father, had mar- ried in 1754 Brinsely Butler, a man of modest fortune who served as MP for Cavan from 1751 to 1768. For his loyal parliamentary service, the govern- ment rewarded Butler with a Commissionership for Revenues and, in 1756, with an earldom in the peerage of Ireland. He had few mental or physical qualities to recommend him to an attractive and spirited woman; they quar- reled frequently, and she left him in the late 1770s and moved to London, her husband dying soon after, in 1779. In the metropolis she entered into a dissipated and extravagant way of living. The settlement the earl had made for her proved to be insufficient to cover her expenses and she was living far beyond her means. In financial distress, besieged by tradesmen and shop- keepers to whom she owed money, she applied to "Jew" King for assistance in 1783.32 At the time King first met Lady Lanesborough, she still retained much of her earlier beauty. "Though past forty, a considerable share of the extraor- dinary beauty of her youth has escaped the ravages of time and withstood the blights of a dissolute and profligate life."33 King's detractors claimed that he took advantage of her financial plight, extracting sexual favors in return for material aid. A gossipy portrait of the couple in The Town and Country Magazine in 1787 suggested that he supplied her pecuniary wants "for a premium which at once indulged his sensuality and pride."34 If so, the countess must have found it a satisfactory arrangement, for she remained with him, through thick and thin, for the next forty years. Thus a liaison that may have originated in squalid circumstances developed over time into a more substantial relationship. John Taylor, noting the vicissitudes of for- tune experienced by King, recalled, "I have sometimes seen him riding in his carriage with Lady Lanesborough and his family, and other times trudging through the streets arm in arm with her in very indifferent weather."35 When King had to flee England in 1784 to escape imprisonment, she went with him, and they lived together in Italy for five or six years on her jointure and, one imagines, his wits. When he had to find refuge on the Continent in 1802 32. The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 98, pt. 2 (1828): 82; The Town and Country Magazine 19 (1787): 297-98; Authentic Memoirs, pp. 233-34. 33.

In 1814, she inherited the income from the Belvedere family estates on the death of her brother, the second and last Earl of Belvedere, and some time after 1817 they retired to Italy where they lived in comfort until his death in Florence in August 1823. (Four and a half years later she also died in Florence, in January 1828.36) "Jew" King's friendship with the Countess of Lanesborough began while he was still married to Sara Nunes Lara. Extramarital relationships like this were not uncommon among acculturated English Jews of the late eighteenth century. Wealthy brokers and merchants openly kept mistresses and entertained ladies of easy virtue.37 In the late 1770s, several years before meeting Lady Lanesborough, King had been linked publicly with the actress Mary Robinson, one of the great beauties of the day, mistress of the Prince of Wales in the early 1780s, and, not coincidentally, the wife of a well-born profligate to whom King had lent considerable sums of money. When the Prince of Wales abandoned Mrs. Robinson for another woman and settled an annuity on her, King attempted, unsuccessfully, to blackmail her by threatening to publish her letters to him.38 Some years before meeting the Countess of Lanesborough, King also appears to have had a long-standing relationship with a Scots woman, a Miss Mackay, by whom he had several illegitimate children.39 King abandoned his wife within a year or two after meeting Lady Lanes- borough. When he fled abroad in 1784, he made no provisions for support- ing his wife or their children. Sara King followed her husband to Livorno, however, and there, before a rabbinical court, obtained a divorce from him. Whether King married Lady Lanesborough, presumably in a Christian cere- mony, before or after the divorce proceedings in Livorno, or whether they ever married, is unclear. Despite rumors to the contrary, King never con- verted to Christianity and, thus, could not have married Lady Lanes- 36.

ENDELMAN borough in the Church of England, at least according to the accepted prac- tices of the Church. However, it was not unheard of for an Anglican clergy- man to perform the marriage ceremony for a Jew and a Christian without requiring the Jew to undergo baptism. What little evidence there is, how- ever, points in the opposite direction. Writing in the early 1830s, John Tay- lor recalled that people had said that Lady Lanesborough had not really been married to King but only appeared as his wife. More significantly, when King himself referred to his companion in a pamphlet written around 1804, he never once spoke of her as "my wife" but always as "Lady Lanes- borough."40 Whatever the legal status of King's "marriage" to Lady Lanesborough, it undoubtedly served in gaining entree to social spheres that otherwise would have been closed to a Jew. Lady Lanesborough was not, of course, an intimate of the most elegant or most fashionable aristocratic society, but she undoubtedly made available to King a wider circle of acquaintances than he had access to previously. In the 1790s, among the frequent visitors to his home, were the eighth Lord Falkland; his sister Lucia (the Hon. Mrs. John Grattan), a prominent figure in faro circles; his brother the Hon. Charles Cary (the ninth Lord Falkland), a captain in the Royal Navy; the fourth Earl of Sandwich, inveterate seducer, flaggelist, and one-time member of Sir Francis Dashwood's Medmenham Monks; Delves Broughton, son of Sir Thomas Broughton, Bart.; and Henry Speed, banker and MP for Hunting- don, 1790-1796.41 King not only sought out the well-born but also took pleasure in enter- taining minor literary and political figures, especially political reformers. In the 1790s, he cultivated the friendship of leading members of the London Corresponding Society, such as John Ashley, Alexander Galloway, Richard Hodgson, Thomas Hardy, Thomas Holcroft, and Francis Place, as well as the utopian anarchist William Godwin, the Jacobin poet and journalist Robert Merry, and the opposition journalist the Rev. Charles Este. John Taylor recalled in his memoirs that he had "enjoyed many pleasant hours" among "accomplished and intelligent society" at King's house and that King was fond of having men of talent at his table.42 40.

His relationship with William Godwin, a frequent guest at his table from early 1795 through late 1798, and possibly beyond, offers a fine illustration of the difficulties confronting a Jewish parvenu in search of social acceptance. (In King's case, needless to say, such difficulties were compounded by his reputation for sharp dealing.) When Godwin first began attending dinners at King's home, he found himself subjected to criticism from his friends. He defended himself by claiming, perhaps not altogether truthfully, that he had accepted "Jew" King's hospitality for anthropologi- cal reasons: "My motive was simple-the study to which I had devoted myself was to man, to analyse his nature as a moralist, and to delineate his passions as an historian, or a recorder of fictitious adventures; and I believed that I should learn from this man and his visitors some lessons which I was not likely to acquire in any other quarter." In short, "Jew" King was an exotic-his meals were to be enjoyed, his manners studied, his friends examined, all with the scientific detachment of the Enlightenment. Accepting his hospitality did not imply becoming his boon companion or even a respectable acquaintance. In the winter of 1795-1796, when King attempted to exploit the relationship by asking Godwin to appear as a char- acter witness in a coming trial, Godwin angrily declined. He accused King of using his dinners as a kind of bribe and reminded him that the frequency of his visits was due to King's initiative, not his own. He told King point-blank that many of his friends objected to his visits to a man, "of whom, to say the least, the world entertained a very ill opinion." Godwin informed King that he had replied that it was absurd to associate only with "immaculate per- sons," adding, somewhat patronizingly, that the errors of the "vicious" could not be corrected if honest men deserted them. These none too subtle slurs failed to cool King's ardor. He continued to seek Godwin's company, assuring him in one letter that Godwin would like him better if he got to know him more intimately.43 King's pursuit of Godwin symbolizes the plight of Jewish parvenus in England. Their only claim to respectable status was their wealth; their only weapons in the struggle for social integration were those that money made possible-generous hospitality, lavish entertaining, munificent and conspic- uous charity-giving. Philosophical learning, literary sensibility, and roman- tic yearnings-the accoutrements of status-seeking German Jews-counted 43.

ENDELMAN for little in upper-class English circles, while wealth went further in estab- lishing respectability than elsewhere in Europe. "Jew" King's contempo- raries, the government loan-contractors Abraham and Benjamin Goldsmid, set out to make a place for themselves in non-Jewish society through gener- ous contributions to non-Jewish charities and lavish entertaining at their country homes.44 "Jew" King's fortune hardly matched that of the Gold- smid brothers or other Anglo-Jewish notables, but he used what he did have in precisely the same way-showering those whom he was wooing with invi- tations to dinner, treating those who accepted to a generous display of food, drink, and furnishings. Francis Place once accepted "with much reluctance" an invitation from King and recalled many years later: "He gave us a sump- tuous dinner of three courses and a dessert all served on plate, the table was attended by men in livery and one in plain cloaths. This disgusted me utter- ly. . ... 45 Place's disgust was a little priggish; many others whom King courted were not so fastidious. Nevertheless, King did not succeed in winning the social acceptance he wanted. Some well-bred Englishmen were willing to befriend him but most had reservations about nouveaux riches Jews, not to say notorious Jewish moneylenders. There were definite limits to the willing- ness of established circles to absorb social upstarts. The Jewishness of a par- venu was not easily overcome, especially if that parvenu was a scoundrel. King himself rationalized his failure by blaming the landed elite for closing its ranks to new men whose fortunes were earned exclusively in commerce and finance. Men of rank, he observed, "view with a jealous eye opulence and splendor that is not derived from inheritance, as if there was intrinsic and superior merit in adventitious birth." They believe it "more creditable to be a member of a fashionable assembly than director of a trading society; and more honourable to inherit a fortune bequeathed from success at cards than from the honest earnings of traffic."46 What King did not state, at least publicly, was that his Jewish origins were also a barrier to social integration. IV As a young man, King was attracted to reform groups critical of the existing political system, perhaps because, as a Jew who had grown up in 44.

This interest in political affairs, which was unusual for even well-to-do, highly acculturated English Jews, can be traced back to his school years. While still a student at the Sephardi charity school, he became friendly with Thomas Paine, who was living then in the same neighborhood, and from whom King received something of a political education. Many years later Paine recalled that he had seen in King "young as you was, a bluntness of temper, a boldness of opinion, and an originality of thought that portended some future good. .... You used to complain of abuses... and wrote your opinions on them in free terms."47 In 1783, King published an indictment of ministerial policy entitled Thoughts on the Difficulties and Distresses in which the Peace of 1783 Has Involved the People of England. In this short pamphlet, King contended that trade was languishing and population decreasing because the government was incompetent and corrupt and its policies detrimental to the well-being of the "middling people." During the war with the American colonies, min- isters, generals, commissioners, and "a whole list of greedy vermin" had exploited the country's distress to increase their own fortunes. Government monopolies and restraints on trade retarded the economy. Mass emigration to India or America was no solution to Britain's economic distress, since India was governed by rapacious colonial administrators and had become a refuge for bankrupts and adventurers, while the American climate was unhealthy, its uncleared and uncultivated soil not suitable to "the dainty sons of England." What was to be done? Disinterested and sincere patriots had to drive out the designing sophists running the government. Tariffs and taxes had to be lowered, sinecures and pensions abolished, the monopoly of the East India Company broken.48 King's political thinking was unremarkable and in most ways typical of antiministerial circles prior to the French Revolution. Whatever Paine's influence, King's approach to politics in this pamphlet was reformist rather than revolutionary. What is remarkable about this foray into political pam- phleteering, however, is that it marks one of the earliest occasions that a Jew anywhere in Europe sought to participate in national political life in pursuit of goals unrelated to Jewish communal needs. (The writings of Isaac de Pinto in the 1760s and 1770s, which appeared in French although he lived mostly in Holland, mark an even earlier-and perhaps the first-Jewish for- ay into general political life.) King's political involvement reveals the extent 47. John King, Mr. King's Speech at Egham, with Thomas Paine's Letter to Him on It, and Mr. King's Reply, 10th ed. (Egham, 1793), pp. 8-9. 48.

Most well-to-do English Jews in the Georgian period probably thought of themselves primarily as Jews and only secondarily, if at all, as Englishmen; almost certainly most were apolitical. Public life in gen- eral mattered little to them unless it affected their status as Jews or their spe- cific economic interests. Still others were reluctant to engage in political activity for fear of endangering the status of the community as a whole.49 Since the legal basis for Jewish settlement in England rested on ill-defined grounds, they thought it best to avoid antagonizing any political faction, especially during the turbulent years of the American War of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars. "Jew" King was among a handful of Jews who broke with this apolitical outlook. In the 1790s, King closely allied himself with groups calling for broader participation in the political process and an end to ministerial corruption. In the early years of the decade, he spoke frequently at a debating club in Car- lisle Street and espoused views more radical than those he had expressed in 1783. For two or three years (ca. 1790-1792), he served as an editor of the A rgus, a radical newspaper scathingly critical of William Pitt and his minis- ters and ardently supportive of Thomas Paine and the London Correspond- ing Society. King entertained leading members of the Society in his home near Manchester Square, and when central figures in the Society were arrested and tried for high treason in May 1794, he contributed generously to the fund for their support. Although King embraced the cause of radical reform for several years in the late 1780s and early 1790s, he did not remain a vociferous critic of the government for long. Late in 1792 he abandoned radicalism and at a public meeting at Egham in Surrey proclaimed his admiration for Pitt and his dis- taste for the French Revolution. This reversal of loyalties resulted not from any careful rethinking of principles but rather from government pressure. The story is involved, but worth recounting for what it reveals about the character of late-Georgian political life. The chain of events that led to King's political turnabout can be traced to one of the shabbiest practices of the London newspaper world in the late- eighteenth century-the extortion of "hush-money" (as it was called) from prominent persons to prevent the publication of abusive material. The Times, for example, regularly composed unflattering letters about the 49.

In the late fall and early winter of 1790, the Argus published a number of arti- cles exposing the extortionate practices of the Times, and in December, King sued the proprietor of the Times, John Walter, for libel, charging that the Times had accused him of swindling a Mr. Rice, a goldsmith in Pall Mall, out of large sums of money. King maintained that Walter had told him that he had printed the allegation because it was accompanied by three guineas but had offered to retract it for five guineas. King's libel case against Walter was tried on February 23, 1791, and the proprietor convicted. However, the government interceded to save Walter, who at the time was already in New- gate Prison for having supported the Prince of Wales during the Regency battle, since the Times had previously been in the government camp. On the understanding that the paper would resume its firm support of the ministry, Walter was released from prison with a full pardon, the Treasury paying his fines. In addition, the government prevented King from pressing for judg- ment and may have given Walter some assurance that it would retaliate against King. The next step in King's abandonment of radicalism began in a most unlikely fashion. In July 1792, two prostitutes appeared at the Bow Street magistrate's office to charge King with assault. They claimed that while engaged in sexual activity of a sadistic character with King they had been whipped with "more than customary severity." In all likelihood, Walter or other persons acting on behalf of the government had put the women up to this. Although they recanted every word of their story the following day and did not testify against King at his trial, he was convicted all the same and fined ?3,000. When King thereupon appealed the case to the Court of King's Bench (with no success) and published a protest in the A rgus, the fine was raised to ?15,000, an enormous sum for the day, which King probably could not have paid. At the same time, the ministerial press launched a cam- paign to inflame the passions of others who had done business with King and had grievances of their own. Faced with a concerted effort on the part of the government and its friends to silence him, King reassessed his political loyalties and apparently came to some kind of understanding with the government. He dropped his association with the Argus and in December 1792 delivered his address at Egham.50 50.

ENDELMAN King's speech, which was published in the ministerial Morning Herald of December 12, 1792, and later republished as a pamphlet, was a defense of the English constitution and an attack on the violent turn which the French Revolution had taken. Although King still did not altogether reject the need for reforms, he now argued that they had to come about in a constitutional manner through the correct parliamentary channels. It would be folly, he felt, for the English to seek political guidance across the Channel. The revo- lution had come under the sway of men lacking either merit or genius; its furious and uncontrollable momentum was consuming those who had brought it into being. When Paine expressed his hurt surprise at King's about-face, King replied that his initial sympathy for the revolutionaries had evaporated when they became dictatorial and oppressive, unleashing "a second carnage on those who differ with them in opinion." He denied, how- ever, that he had abandoned the cause of political reform: "When it is the proper season, I shall again exclaim against the twenty millions of annual taxes, against pensions, sinecure places, and unequal representation; but, instead of exclaiming against the King as you [Paine] have done, I look to him to assist in the reformation." As for Paine's plans for the "equaliza- tion" of society, which King had never found attractive, they were illusory: under every form of government, there always had to be laborers, just as there always had to be governors to restrain the bad and guide the ignorant. Paine's equality was a prescription for anarchy."5 King's defense of the English constitution, including his warm words for George III and property rights, marked a retreat from the radical antiminis- terial stance of his years with the Argus, but it did not represent a full swing from left to right. He remained committed to the legislative reform of politi- cal abuses. In an open letter to Paine published in the Morning Herald of April 17, 1793, he argued that, although there were few radical evils in the English system, there were many abuses. However, their reform had to wait for that time when England's overseas enemies were no longer seeking to destroy what Englishmen were striving only to amend.52 In the middle of the decade, he allied himself with the nonviolent reformers of the London Cor- responding Society, contributing to the support of those arrested for treason in 1794, defending the liberties of those whom the government sought to silence. By 1795, he was again moving into the antiministerial camp. In 51. King, Mr. King's Speech. 52.

Under the pre- tense of securing the constitution, he argued, the ministers had violated many of its fundamental laws. Moreover, by oppressing and exasperating the people, the government's measures pushed them to seek redress, para- doxically, in insurrection and violence.53 To some reformers, however, King's change of heart was suspect, per- haps because he was a Jew, perhaps because he was a usurer. Francis Place did not trust him and "always suspected that he contemplated some ini- quity"-i.e., that he was a government informer. But Place did admit that some reformers were willing to credit King for honest opinions and good intentions. King himself noted that his motives had been called into ques- tion at the time that he had subscribed to the fund for those arrested for treason and that rumors circulated that he had provided secret intelligence to Pitt and the Duke of Portland, the Home Secretary. For King, such accu- sations were part and parcel of the blackening of his reputation by a sensa- tionalist press.54 As for their truth or falsity, there is no evidence one way or the other. In business matters King was certainly a scoundrel with few, if any, scruples. Yet his public denial of the charge of being a government spy and his long-standing concern with reform stretching back to the early 1780s suggest that his friendliness toward members of the London Corre- sponding Society was not mercenary. V King's absorption into spheres of activity outside the previous range of Jewish concerns diluted and diminished his Jewish identity. The more he moved in non-Jewish circles, embraced English habits of mind, and identi- fied himself as an Englishman, the more his Jewishness ceased to be central to his sense of self-definition. This does not mean that he replaced his old identity with a thoroughly new one and all traces of his former "Jewish" self 53.

ENDELMAN disappeared. Human personality is not like a lump of clay, which can be molded into new forms at will. Acculturation, integration, and seculariza- tion reshaped and attenuated Jewish identity, but rarely did they extinguish it. External events and personal crises could at times reawaken loyalties long buried and neglected, as the history of Zionism in Western Europe and the United States clearly demonstrates. Even the apostate, seeking to wash away his Jewishness in the waters of the baptismal font, usually failed to loosen completely the hold of his Jewish past (although his children or grandchildren frequently were able to do so). At a minimum, the non- Jewish world rarely forgot the origins of even the most assimilated Jews. This was certainly the case with "Jew" King, whose epithet bears testimony to the manner in which Gentiles continued to see him even after his change of name. As a student at the Sephardi charity school, King had received a basic introduction to the fundamentals of Jewish tradition. He had learned to read the prayerbook in Hebrew and possibly some biblical passages as well. He had also regularly attended services at the Sephardi synagogue in Bevis Marks, as did all charity students. After leaving school, he apparently ceased to observe even the most rudimentary of Jewish traditions. There is no indication that at this point he continued to attend services at Bevis Marks. In externals, he lived as a non-Jew, and, if we are to believe his testi- mony at a later date, he even had begun to think of himself as a Christian in a vague sort of way. As he told the Court of King's Bench in 1795, he had considered himself a member of the Church of England since he had been old enough to judge such matters for himself. However, when examined fur- ther on this point, he admitted that he had been married according to Jewish rites and had never been baptized or admitted to the established church; nor had he formally renounced Judaism.55 King's testimony, which may not have been altogether truthful, nevertheless indicates his strong desire to be identified with the majority of Englishmen, as did his change of name two decades earlier. King's testimony in 1795 raises the question of why he did not formally 55. Rex vs. Gilham, I Espinasse, pp. 285-86. In Rex vs. Gilham, King was called as a wit- ness regarding the financial misdeeds of another party. He was sworn on the New Testament, and after he began giving testimony the defense attorney stopped him and began raising ques- tions about whether King was a Jew, and, if so, whether his oath was binding since he was sworn on the New Testament. Lord Kenyon ruled that King's testimony was admissable since King now considered himself a member of the Church of England and bound by the precepts of that religion.</page><page sequence="27">THE CHECKERED CAREER OF "JEW" KING 95 embrace Christianity, given his distance from Judaism and the Jewish com- munity. When he went abroad for the first time with Lady Lanesborough in the 1780s, it was rumored that he became an apostate in order to marry her. Although untrue, the rumor testifies to the widely held assumption that the obvious thing for someone in King's position to do would be to join the church. At this time dozens of Jews whose links with Jewry were already weakened did precisely this in order to advance their careers or merge more completely into country society. King's unwillingness to take this step sug- gests that even at this early date radical assimilation did not necessarily lead to conversion. Unquestionably one major reason he did not become a Chris- tian was the areligious tone of the circles in which he moved. Conversion would not have enhanced King's standing in the eyes of those groups whose approval he was courting. Similarly, conversion would not have brought him greater material success or improved his civil status. Equally decisive in King's case-and surely in many others-was a deep- ly rooted ambivalence about being Jewish. His testimony in 1795 was meant to give the impression that he had rejected his past altogether, but such a declaration can hardly be taken at face value. It is difficult, if not impos- sible, for a member of a self-conscious and persecuted minority to shed his or her past like an unfashionable suit of clothes. King had ceased to live as a Jew in a religious or ceremonial sense and was eager to break out of the con- fines of the Anglo-Jewish community, but it is unlikely that he had success- fully suppressed all memories of and attachments to his origins. Perhaps he retained a muted pride in Judaism, for late in life, when he came under attack for personal and business misbehavior, he proclaimed his Jewishness in proud, almost defiant terms. In defending his character in a pamphlet published in 1798, King noted that his faith was often called into question. It is unclear whether this meant that he had become the object of anti-Jewish animadversions or simply that his own attachment to any religion was being called into question. In any case, King answered his detractors by defending Judaism. In common with other European Jews who had been exposed to Enlightenment thinking, he first defined Judaism in highly rationalistic terms. The "transcendent object" of his "adoration" was "not profaned by mythological fantasms, or incarnated like heathen Deities." King believed that a superior intelligence or divine intellectual power had formed the world and that Judaism, divested of its ceremonies, was a reli- gion of deism. However, not being a systematic thinker, King also defended Judaism on traditional grounds as well. He argued that Judaism's antiquity gave it an advantage over other religions. Furthermore, the very survival of</page><page sequence="28">96 TODD M. ENDELMAN the Jews over the centuries was evidence that Divine Providence was guiding their fate in history. Their conquerors had perished while they had remained, "firm in their faith, steady in their religion, and numerous as ever." Not only did King defend Judaism, but he went on to attack his cri- tics as well. He accused Christians of failing to obey the morality of the gospels, citing the "uncharitable temper" of Protestants and the "intolerant spirit" of Catholics, as well as Christian attitudes regarding Jews. He reminded his adversaries that Jesus had been a Jew and that Christian perse- cution of Jews made it seem as if Christians regretted Jesus' birth.56 King's defense of Judaism was shallow, inconsistent, and unlearned, more an emotional outburst than a reasoned polemic. His willingness to bruise Christian sensibilities, on the other hand, was remarkable. The com- munal notables, who were extremely cautious about challenging Christian beliefs, consistently discouraged public defenses of Judaism, believing (prob- ably incorrectly) that any Jewish rebuttal to Christian polemics would endanger the community.57 King obviously felt that he could write freely on this matter without risking serious consequences, either for himself or the community. His defense of Judaism was also notable in that it signaled a return to Jewishness on his part. This public avowal of the superiority of Judaism did not mean that King had become ritually observant, only that he had given up the attempt to bury his past and had become reconciled to his Jewishness. His former identity reasserted itself, although at an earlier period it certainly appeared to have been irretrievably lost. No doubt the mounting crescendo of press attacks in the 1790s, as well as his legal difficul- ties, served to provoke this awakening of older loyalties. Perhaps an aware- ness of the futility of radical assimilation, at least in his case, also played a part. Besieged, harassed, and exhausted, he may have fallen back on an old- er identity as a means of reasserting his integrity. From this point King became even more assertively Jewish. When he gave testimony in the matter of the Southcottian bills of exchange in June 1807, he took the oath on the Old Testament. Questioned about his religion, he acknowledged that earlier in his life he had taken the oath on the New Testament but asserted that now he was a Jew, not a deist, and "performed this solemnity according to the Mosaic creed, although he did not observe all the ceremonies of the modern Israelite.""58 It is likely that around this 56.

In 1812, in a number of letters to the Mahamad of the Sephardi congregation criticizing the state of the worship service, he men- tioned that his infrequent attendance at the synagogue was due to the lack of devotion there, a criticism made by a number of writers at the time. He attributed the small number of worshippers to the absence of decorum in the service and, in particular, singled out for blame the unruly conduct of the charity school boys. He even proposed a number of reforms to achieve greater decorum and offered his help in implementing them.59 King's letters leave the clear impression that he had become a member of the Bevis Marks congregation and that he attended services there, if only infrequently. More significantly, his letters to the Mahamad demonstrated a concern with the character of Jewish worship and life in England, although the depth of this concern should not be exaggerated. Still, that he bothered at all to address the problem is significant. Jews who were thoroughly alienated from the community did not trouble themselves about abuses in Judaism. They did not become religious reformers; for them, Judaism had ceased to be a matter of concern altogether. King's most forthright statement of his renewed adherence to Judaism and the Jewish community came in an introduction he wrote in 1817 to a new edition of David Levi's apologia for Judaism, Dissertations on the Prophecies of the Old Testament, which was first published in three volumes between 1793 and 1800. Levi, a learned hat-dresser, was one of the few Jews in late-Georgian England to answer Christian polemicists who sought to prove the errors of the Jews.60 As the title indicates, his work attacked Chris- tian interpretations of prophetic passages pertaining to the fate of the people Israel. King republished Levi's polemic in 1817 in response to missionary work being conducted among the Jewish poor by the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews. To this edition King added a sixty page introduction, dedicated to the Haham, Raphael Meldola, in which he offered a surprisingly traditional defense of rabbinic Judaism. The integrity of Judaism, King asserted, rested on the fact that God delivered the law, both written and oral, to Moses on Mount Sinai in the presence of 600,000 persons rather than in a private act of revelation. Those who were witnesses to the events on Sinai transmitted the text of the Mosaic law to the next gen- 59. Albert M.

"Levi, David."</page><page sequence="30">98 TODD M. ENDELMAN eration, and thus from generation to generation it was handed on, unal- tered, unperverted, eternally binding. Jews observed their religion at present everywhere in the world in precisely the same way that they did in the time of Moses, while Christianity, on the other hand, had undergone many muta- tions and schisms. Jesus himself, who was born and died a Jew, had never abolished any part of the law or expressed any intention of founding a new religion, but continued to observe the commandments all his life. King pointed out that nowhere in scripture was it asserted or even intimated that Jewish law was the adumbration of another law. The messiah of the Jews would be a supporter of the Mosaic code, not its destroyer. King also argued, as he had in 1798, that Jewish survival was itself both consequence and proof of chosenness: the Jews were God's peculiar people, their preser- vation an act of Divine Providence. He also mocked the pedigrees of the nations of Europe, pointing out that they were unable to trace their origins back into the distant past and that they were each a hybrid mixture of many peoples, while the Jews could deduce their genealogy from the beginning of the world.61 Alfred Rubens has described King's introduction to Levi's work as "a competent and utterly hypocritical piece of writing."62 This judgment is wrong on two counts. To call it competent is too charitable. It is rambling, discursive and without a shred of originality. Yet to brand it hypocritical is to miss its importance completely. Whether King accepted the literal truth of the orthodox position he took is irrelevant. His boastful defense of Juda- ism should be seen rather as an autobiographical expression of his return to the identity, if not faith, of his fathers. His unambiguous defense of Judaism should be read as an affirmation of his Jewishness, not as a theological doc- ument. King had been the recipient of severe abuse for most of his adult life and in 1817 he was, by the standards of the time, an old man, being then in his sixties. This introduction was the defiant gesture of an old Jew seeking revenge on a world that he believed had treated him unfairly. By asserting the superiority of his ancestral faith over the Christianity of his detractors, King was both justifying his return to Judaism and settling a score with the non-Jewish world that he had once sought to conquer. When he died in 1824, he did so unequivocably as a Jew: in his will, he left ?20 to the Sephar- 61.

He did not lead campaigns to make Jews more equal or productive members of society or to make Jewish worship more dignified. He did not sit on the board of any communal organization or associate with Jews who did. He did not contrib- ute in any way to the debate within European Jewry over the shape of Juda- ism and the character of Jewish identity in the age of emancipation. He did not amass a fortune in government finance or international trade and buy his (or his children's) way into upper-class society. Indeed, during much of his adult life he had very little to do with Judaism in any sense of the term, although he never ceased to be identified as a Jew by the gentile majority. Yet the career of "Jew" King is not merely a colorful footnote to the mainstream of modern Jewish history-unless the proper subject matter of modern Jewish history is to remain restricted to the activities of that handful of Jews who managed the affairs of the Jewish communities of Europe. If the adoption by Jews of non-Jewish values and modes of behavior and their entry into new spheres of activity within state and society are major themes in modern Jewish history, then the experiences of a "Jew" King are no less critical to understanding this period than those of a David Friedliinder, an Abraham Furtado, a Benjamin Goldsmid. Regardless of their intellectual stature and material standing within the community, all Jews had to con- front and adjust to a set of political and social conditions radically different from those that existed a half century or century before. They did so in a variety of ways. They did not enter the modern world like a well-disciplined army, tramping faithfully in the footsteps of Mendelssohn and the maski- lim. The dual processes of acculturation and integration were acted out in countless thousands of private acts and encounters, mostly but not entirely unrecorded and unobserved, far from the limelight of public discussion. The life of "Jew" King is part of his history. His career suggests that the scope of 63.
