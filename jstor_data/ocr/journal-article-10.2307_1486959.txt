<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hava Tirosh-Rothschild. Between Worlds: The Life and Thought of Rabbi David ben Judah Messer Leon. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991. viii, 385 pp. Hava Tirosh-Rothschild is an historian of Jewish thought whose exper- tise in medieval and Renaissance philosophy became accessible in 1982 with the publication of three articles dealing with the concepts of Sefirot and Torah in the works of Rabbi David ben Judah Messer Leon and the influence of Judah Halevi on Rabbi David's thought. In 1986, she published a study of the "interplay" between Maimonides and Aquinas in medieval Jewish philosophy. Her 1988 article, "In Defense of Jewish Humanism," analyzed Rabbi David's apologia for the "studia humanitas"-especially rhetoric and poetry-as contained in his Shevab Ha-Nashim, composed in Constantinople in the wake of his exile from Naples. All of these publica- tions originated in her 1978 doctoral dissertation, supervised by the late Professor Shlomo Pines, which focused on the synthesis of Aristotelianism and Kabbalah in Rabbi David's thought. Between Worlds: The Life and Thought of Rabbi Judah ben David Messer Leon incorporates all of these earlier publications and supplements them with chapters devoted to the related topics of Rabbi David's biography, his not uncritical pro-Maimonideanism, and his views regarding Jewish dog- mas. In combining all of this material, Tirosh-Rothschild hoped to provide her prior research with a "new nuance" (p. viii). The discussion, for exam- ple, of Rabbi David's self-imposed seclusion and unsuccessful career as a preacher in Constantinople innovates by casting new light on his biography (pp. 62-68 and the richly documented notes). When she asserts that "the entire concept of Jewish theology and in turn of Jewish dogma was indebted to Christian scholasticism, especially to Aquinas" (p. 313, n. 18), she inno-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 317 vates by advocating more forcefully theses entertained in the earlier publica- tions. But the major difference between the monograph and the earlier dis- sertation and publications is due to a change in theoretical perspective. Tirosh-Rothschild describes this reorientation as a "methodological shift from the history of ideas to intellectual history which took place during my years at Columbia University" (p. vii). More precisely, she associates her work with the historiographical contextualism of Quentin Skinner (The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, etc.), and distances it from the poststructuralists or deconstruction. As those who have wrestled with Derrida's readings of Plato, Rousseau, J. L. Austin, or J. Searle know, philosophic texts can be made to resemble novels and poems. Even Rabbi David's synthesis of Ashkenazic halakhah, Renaissance humanism, Kabbalah, and Maimonidean-Thomism is vulner- able to hermeneutical microbes that dissolve authorial intentions and disre- gard settings "outside the text" in order to promote the free play of intertex- tuality. Being committed to contextualism, therefore, is no trivial program- matic decision for an intellectual historian like Tirosh-Rothschild who is aware of the alternatives and for whom Lovejoy's history of ideas is Scylla and postmodern linguistic skepticism is Charybdis. Being committed to Skinner's style of contextualism affiliates the his- torian with the philosophical principles developed by R. G. Collingwood and Alasdair MacIntyre. It also seems to entail paying less attention to individual theorists and more to "the most relevant characteristics of the societies in and for which they originally wrote" (see The Found'ations of Modern Political Thought, vol. 1, pp. x-xi). Accordingly, Tirosh-Rothschild systematically anchors her expositions of Rabbi David's scholastic dialectics and his biography in the bedrock of social history. The monograph is stud- ded with detailed, well-documented, and pedagogically useful sketches describing the diverse traditions governing rabbinic authority (Ashkenazic vs. Sephardic), the economic basis of the Jewish elite in Italy, the attitudes toward women in rabbinic thought, the Renaissance appreciation for secu- lar biographies, and, especially, the swirl of personal, political, and cultural controversies generated by the diverse ethnic groups of natives and immi- grant/exiles in both Renaissance Italy and the Ottoman Empire. Skinner's contextualism directs the historian to demystify philosophy by uncovering its ideological or social functions. With their words, philos- ophers seek to do something, usually to persuade their readers to behave in a certain way. To illustrate this principle, Tirosh-Rothschild everywhere</page><page sequence="3">318 BOOK REVIEWS emphasizes Rabbi David's apologetic and polemical motives: he sought to legitimate the incorporation of non-Jewish, Renaissance culture into Jewish life, hence his admiration for Maimonides; he sought to protect Judaism from Christian pressure by arguing vehemently against antirationalism and, ironically, by co-opting Aquinas's apologia for the superiority of revelation and the legitimacy of faith; he reconciled kabbalistic theosophy with Aris- totelianism, without himself being a kabbalist, in order to combat the con- verts and humanists in Florence who sundered the Kabbalah from Judaism, embracing the former while reviling the latter; and he sided with the native Greek-speaking Jews of Constantinople and with the Ashkenazic legal tra- dition in order to defend his own authority and livelihood against the claims of Iberian-Sephardic separatist congregations. Historiographical contextualism, however, is not the only method informing the monograph. Quellenforschung, the venerable search for sources and influences, and a vestigial Hegelianism dominate Tirosh- Rothschild's erudite discussions of Rabbi David's dogmas (creatio ex nihilo, prophecy, and miracles) and her analysis of his understanding of God's exis- tence, attributes, essence, knowledge, and providence (chaps. 6-7). This mode of historical explanation proceeds topically; it assumes a conversation between great minds who transcend the limits of time and the particularities of social context. Its task is to locate the synchronic place of an author's pronouncements in that conversation. Tirosh-Rothschild therefore intro- duces Rabbi David's statements of problems and his solutions with a "short history" of the topic: back to Aristotle and the rabbis, through Saadia, and on to Maimonides as endorsed, corrected, or repudiated by Gersonides, Crescas, Albo, Abravanel, Abraham Shalom, Bibago, and, of course, Aquinas. Occasionally, and characteristically, these "short histories" even include nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarly opinions unknown to Rabbi David himself. (See, for example, p. 169 for a reference to the Elohist and Yahwist authors of the pentateuchal mosaic.) Chapters 1-3 treat Rabbi David's life. The biographical data are pre- sented as the necessary background for understanding the scholastic dialec- tics explicated in chapters 4-7. Slightly at odds with Skinner's contextu- alism, this approach to intellectual history leads to the study of bookish individuals whose passion for thinking distinguishes them from other types of persons. It was puzzling, therefore, to discover that Tirosh-Rothschild saw neither methodological inconsistency nor philosophic problem in stat- ing that she was separating Rabbi David's life from his thought (see p. 104).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 319 In this wide-ranging and encyclopedic monograph, there is a scant handful of minor points over which a reviewer could quibble: delatot (p. 91), for example, might better be translated as "columns of text" than as "mea- sures," and maqbil (p. 189) is more precisely rendered as "opposite" than as "corollary." To argue that Maimonides "was deeply concerned that mista- ken understandings about God destroy something in God" (p. 200) is to suggest that Maimonides endorsed a theurgic concept of language or believed that human intellect and the divine Mind are identical. There are also more controversial, usually ahistoric, assertions deserving of comment. For instance, is rabbinic Judaism essentially orthopractic in contrast to Christianity's creedal orthodoxy (cf. p. 140)? What might justify the declara- tion that talk "about God is the very core of religion" (p. 199)? To which socioeconomic class of a specific society might this assertion be meaningful- ly applied? Such criticisms, however, seem to be beside the point for the many of us who sympathize with Tirosh-Rothschild's research agenda. As this mono- graph shows, navigating the passage from the history of ideas to intellectual history is worthwhile and difficult. In her use of divergent historiographic methods to integrate new systematic perspectives with old learning, she has raised the theoretical problem of consistency. But in using a multidisciplin- ary approach to Rabbi David, she has advanced the cause of social history and profoundly enriched our understanding of Jewish life in Renaissance Italy and the Ottoman Empire.
