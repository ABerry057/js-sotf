<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD: PRIMARY OR SECONDARY PHENOMENON? by DAVID KRAEMER Virtually without exception, the Bavli is described by its students as a commentary on the Mishnah. This definition is such a commonplace that it is difficult to imagine the need to test or defend it. Its accuracy seems so self- evident that the question "what is the Bavli?" is itself rarely, if ever, asked. But even if the definition is correct (and this has recently been chal- lenged; see below), this does not mean that scholars are exempt from testing it, if only to offer it anew. The task of proposing an adequate definition of the Bavli is, despite all appearances, not a simple one. The text is extra- ordinarily vast, and because of its vastness it is often difficult to grasp more than its details. But it is precisely such a grasp that is necessary before a defi- nition can be offered. The challenge, therefore, is to seek the large structures upon which the Bavli is erected, requiring the sort of reading to which the document is perhaps least well suited. Despite its difficulty, the exercise of definition promises much. If we describe a document we begin to gain access to those who composed it. Who were they? What was important to them? How did they view the world? Choices of subject and form are ideological choices, and so inquiry into these and other literary considerations will yield explicit evidence regarding the broad ideological assumptions of a document's authors. Furthermore, My gratitude is due to Baruch Bokser and Leonard Gordon for their kind suggestions in the revision of this paper. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID KRAEMER the more we are able to nuance a description, the more insight will be gained into the community that produced a given document. Though a broad defi- nition might appear adequate, the substrata of details must be probed as well. For these reasons, the Bavli ought now to be subjected to fresh studies of description and definition. Being the grandest and most complete expression to emerge from Babylonian Judaism in late antiquity, its testimony to the nature of that Judaism is without parallel. Its pages embody the sinew and spirit of its community and age, and its definitions exemplify, to a significant extent, the self-definitions of that same community. It is only through describing, and thereby understanding, this document that the Judaism of that period and place may truly be grasped. But in this instance definition promises even more. By gaining a fuller understanding of the Bavli as a religious and intellectual composition, some- thing may also be said about the communities into which it was received. The Bavli became, of course, the foundation document for virtually all of (rabbinic) Judaism to follow. What made it so influential and convincing? Was its success merely political, or is there something in the power of its ideas and the design of its composition that accounts for its ultimately uni- versal reception in late antique and medieval Judaism? Having framed the question this way, a response must also account for the Bavli's "competitor," the Yerushalmi. Both are, after all, understood to be commentaries on the Mishnah. But the communities that produced them were hardly identical. In order to distinguish the Judaism of early-fifth- century Palestine from that of sixth-century Babylonia, it is necessary to seek the characteristics by which the Yerushalmi and Bavli are distinguished from one another. Furthermore, if there is interest in comprehending the forces that cause a document of this sort to be received as authoritative, it is imperative to ask why the Bavli ultimately came to be preferred. What, if anything, makes the Bavli unique? It is in recognition of precisely these issues and questions that Jacob Neusner defined the program of his recent book on the Bavli, Judaism: The Classical Statement.' His findings in that study are of extraordinary note. Based upon his taxonomy of "units of discourse" in tractates Sukkah, Sotah, and Sanhedrin in both Talmuds, Neusner concludes that the authors of the Bavli chose, when framing that document, not only to follow the 1. Chicago and London, 1986.</page><page sequence="3">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 3 order of the Mishnah and to compose a commentary upon it (as had been the case in the Yerushalmi), but to allow Scripture, as well, to form the organizational outline upon which the Bavli's commentary would be based.2 In significant proportion the Bavli is also a Scripture commentary, Neusner claims, and its previous characterizations now require significant revision. If Neusner is correct, then our understanding of the Judaism that pro- duced the Bavli must also undergo revision. Briefly, both Scripture and the Mishnah having been posited as its foundation, the Bavli will now be seen as the definitive summa of classical Judaism, and this not merely on account of historical accident, but by design. It will be the comprehensive synthesis of all of rabbinic Judaism that preceded, including Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara. It might even be suggested that this redactional choice mirrors an ideological choice to equate written and oral Torah, an equation which, as Neusner has shown, was made explicitly (that is, by use of the term "oral Torah," in full) in the Bavli for the very first time.3 But Neusner's conclusions require careful evaluation, particularly since the sample upon which he bases his conclusions does not uniformly speak in his support. Distinguishing "Scripture units of discourse" from all others, including those that employ Scripture to comment directly on Mishnah, Neusner shows that in tractate Sotah, 32.1 percent of the total units of discourse are based on Scripture, in Sanhedrin 35.3 percent are, but in Suk- kah, only 2.9 percent of the total address Scripture independent of Mishnah.4 It is this latter number that requires that we proceed with caution. Why ought we to suppose that Sukkah is anomalous and that Sotah and Sanhedrin are typical of the Bavli? Perhaps both are representative of a type that appears in equivalent proportions, in which case the claims for the whole will have to be phrased more modestly. Or perhaps, in the end, it will turn out that Sanhedrin and Sotah are less typical, and though they might include significant Scripture commentaries, this is not true of the Bavli as a whole. There is nothing in the data that Neusner adduces, as far as I can see, to indicate which of these possibilities is more likely. Until we make this 2. See Neusner, pp. 223 and 233. 3. See Torah: From Scroll to Symbol in Formative Judaism (Philadelphia, 1985), pp. 144 f.

See Neusner, Judaism, pp. 96-100.</page><page sequence="4">4 DAVID KRAEMER determination, it seems premature to argue for a total revision of the "tra- ditional" wisdom. It is not necessary to actually replicate Neusner's procedure for a sub- stantial portion of the Bavli to evaluate the reliability of his sample. There are other ways to test the likelihood that either Sotah and Sanhedrin, on the one hand, or Sukkah, on the other, are/is more typical of the Bavli as a whole. One way-tedious but nevertheless available-would be simply to count the total number of scriptural citations per tractate (or per page in a given tractate) for a significant proportion of the Bavli. If it turned out that Sotah and Sanhedrin have a significantly higher proportion than most other trac- tates, then we would have to conclude that Sukkah is more likely to reflect the norm. If, on the other hand, it turned out that Sukkah has a significantly lower proportion, then we would have to favor Sotah and Sanhedrin as normal. I have not conducted such an accounting (nor am I aware that anyone else has), but I have reason to believe, based upon other data, that the former is the case, and not the latter. It is these data that I will present below. In earlier research5 I conducted a detailed analysis of the nature of the traditions attributed to the most prominent amoraic sages of the first four generations6 (Rav, Samuel, Johanan, Resh Laqish,7 Judah, Huna, Nach- man, Sheshet, Hisda, Joseph, Rabba, Abbaye, and Rava). In the course of this analysis I enumerated traditions that articulated legal opinions, those that interpreted earlier rabbinic texts (usually either Mishnah or baraitot), and those that interpreted Scripture.8 These latter traditions can form the 5.

The "generations" are conventions, and there is some difference in arrangement among scholars. The sages to whom we are referring flourished in the mid-third to the mid-forth cen- turies. 7. The statistics for this sage have been misplaced, hence his absence from the following tables. His contribution was not as large as that of many others, however, and the sample is large enough that this will not affect the outcome. 8. These traditions were the "apodictic" traditions attributed to these sages, and not state- ments found in argumentational exchanges. Argumentational contributions are extremely rare in the earliest generations, and are considerably fewer in number than apodictic traditions even in the later generations that I include. Furthermore, comments on Scripture are rare in the argumentation. For this reason, our choice of data can be considered reliable. See SCAL, chaps. ii-iv.</page><page sequence="5">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 5 basis of an accurate test for the representativeness of the tractates under consideration. The reliability of a test based upon this body of amoraic traditions can be justified in this way: First, a quick review of the texts that embody the majority of Scripture units of discourse in Neusner's study will indicate that amoraic traditions, of which those of these sages form a sizable proportion, are relatively prominent in the samples. Their contribution is supplemented significantly only by baraitot, and in a far more limited way by interpreta- tions of the anonymous gemara. By way of a concrete example, in the lengthy section of Scripture units of discourse at Sotah 9b-14a (M. Sotah 1:8-9), of a total of eighty-seven units delineated by Neusner, only five are clearly attributable to the anonymous gemara,9 and four are more difficult to identify.'0 All other units are formed around either amoraic traditions (the vast majority) or baraitot. In these, the anonymous gemara only com- ments modestly, for the most part, and in all respects is subservient to the identified (amoraic or tannaitic) tradition." Because of its prominence, therefore, the amoraic contribution may be taken to be representative of the whole. Furthermore, though my sample includes not only traditions that treat Scripture independently of Mishnah, but also those that employ Scrip- ture in the service of Mishnah, this difference should not be taken to invali- date the relevance of the sample. Since finding a source for Mishnah in Scripture is a general objective in the Talmud's Mishnah exegesis, we must assume that Scripture units related to Mishnah are distributed with relative uniformity through the Bavli (or at least with greater uniformity than Scrip- ture units that are independent of Mishnah). In fact, Neusner's own analysis supports this conclusion. In his detailing of the use of Scripture in Sotah, units independent of Mishnah are grouped in few distinct sections (pp. 96-97). Units that elaborate Mishnah, on the other hand, relate to almost all Mishnah paragraphs (pp. 88-89). This being the case, in order more closely to approach Neusner's sample we may, at the outset, subtract a cer- tain number from the base of units found in each tractate. What this means is that discrepancies between tractates should be considered to be even more 9. Nos. xxxiii, xlviii, Ivii, Iviii, lxxiv. 10. Nos. xl, li, lxiii, lxviii-the language of composition of these units makes it likely that they are simply baraitot that are not identified as such. 11. Professor D. Halivni, in personal consultation, has confirmed this conclusion on the basis of his own studies with respect to the rest of the Bavli. The anonymous gemara rarely generates comment on Scripture independently.</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID KRAEMER Table 1 Total Number of Comments on Scripture, by Tractate Name of Sage Ber. Shab.

As can easily be seen in table 1, even as a pre- liminary test the numbers suggest that Sotah and Sanhedrin should not be taken to be representative. A number of things may be said about the numbers shown in the tables. First, there is some variation based upon the individual contributor.'2 Joseph, for example, contributes relatively few scriptural comments. The same may be said for Judah, though his contribution on Sanhedrin is quite pronounced. Johanan, on the other hand, is rather prolific in this area, though his traditions are especially preserved in tractates from Mo'ed. Second, earlier sages seem to have contributed more than later sages, but the fact that Rava is an exception suggests that the most crucial factor is the total quantity of a sage's contribution (Rava and Rav are the most prolific 12. I do not assume that traditions attributed to a particular sage were necessarily com- posed by that sage. That is in no way necessary for the data herein examined to be deemed re- liable for present purposes. Even if the attributions are an absolute fiction (which I do not assume), they may still be used as a test for the distribution of Scripture comments through dif- ferent Bavli tractates, for the reasons that I described above. The language I use below in refer- ence to these attributions is more literal merely for purposes of brevity.</page><page sequence="8">8 DAVID KRAEMER sages in the Bavli, followed by Johanan). In any case, the general picture, by tractate, comes through quite clearly. Both Sotah and Sanhedrin are obviously in the upper end of scriptural units, and are perhaps even exceptional. This certainly seems to be the case for Sanhedrin, which, even given its length, preserves scriptural comments in a quantity well above other tractates (see table 2). The same, I would argue, is the case with Sotah, which, despite its moderate length, neverthe- Table 2 Total Number of Scriptural Comments Attributed to Sages Accounted by Tractate No. of Comments Tractate 1-9 Bezah, Me'ilah 10-19 Moed Katan, Nazir, Gittin, Makkot, Horayot, Temurah, Keritot, Niddah 20-29 Sukkah, Rosh Hashana, Hagigah, B.M., Shevuot, Arakhin 30-39 Eruvin, Taanit, Ketubot, Kiddushin, A.Z., Menachot, Bekhorot 40-49 Nedarim, B.K. 50-59 Pesachim, Yoma, Hullin 60-69 Yevamot, B.B., Zevachim 70-79 - 80-89 Berachot, Shabbat, Megillah, Sotah 90+ Sanhedrin less includes more such traditions than nearly any other tractate, including many which greatly exceed it in length. Berachot is similar to Sotah in both quantity and length, and Megillah, though relatively short, includes a great many comments on Scripture. But these four (Shabbat, when adjusted for its length, will not be equivalent to the others) are obviously out of the ordinary. Accounting for their respective lengths, in comparison to other tractates, will only reinforce this conclusion. In table 3 I consider the number of scriptural comments by the sages listed in table 1 per page of printed Bavli text. Of course this is not a precise measure, but with a few exceptions (that I have indicated) the amount of text per printed page is approximately equivalent over the whole, and for pur- poses of such a comparison we are certainly within the realm of reason.</page><page sequence="9">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 9 Table 3 Number of Scriptural Comments per Page of Printed Bavli Text ( Vilna Edition) Tractate No. of pages No. of comments per page Ber. 64+ 1.29/1 Shab. 157 0.55/1 Eruv. 105 0.34/1 Pesachim 121 0.46/1 R.H. 35 0.8/1 Yoma 88 0.59/1 Sukkah 56 0.36/1 Bezah 40 0.17/1 Megillah 32 2.6/1 Ta'anit 31 1.2/1 M.K. 29 0.51/1 Chag. 27 0.77/1 Yev. 122 0.53/1 Ket. 112 0.28/1 Ned. 91- 0.45/1 Nazir 66- 0.21/1 Sotah 49+ 1.6/1 Gittin 90 0.19/1 Kid. 82 0.4/1 B.K. 119 0.34/1 B.M. 119 0.23/1 B.B. 176- 0.39/1 Sanh. 113+ 2.2/1 Shev. 49 0.43/1 Makkot 24 0.42/1 A.Z. 76 0.45/1 Horayot 14 1.0/1 Zev. 120 0.53/1 Men. 110 0.27/1 Hullin 142 0.37/1 Bechorot 61 0.59/1 Arakhin 34 0.62/1 Temurah 34 0.44/1 Ker. 28 0.5/1 Me'ilah 22+ 0.13/1 Niddah 73 0.24/1 Note: + or - indicates whether pages should be added or subtracted in order to accout for dif- ferences of quantity of text per printed page.</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID KRAEMER Adjusted for the length of the tractate, again the exceptional nature of Sotah and Sanhedrin (as well as Berachot and Megillah) can be seen. These are the only tractates (along with Ta'anit, which, because of its brevity, finds its proportion a little skewed) in which the ratio of scriptural comments per page is greater than 1 / 1. In particular, the ratio for Sanhedrin is noteworthy because one would expect, on account of its length, that its ratio would be more even (much as the ratio for Megillah is higher because of its brevity). In fact, the majority of tractates have a ration of 0.5/1 or less, and in light of these data, it appears more likely that Sukkah represents the norm, while Sotah and Sanhedrin are distinct from the norm. Another measure confirms the same conclusion. In general, the number of non-Scripture-related traditions contributed by the sages listed above is far greater than those that are Scripture-related. It will be of interest to con- sider whether this is the case in the tractates that we have termed exception- al. I have chosen, for illustration, those sages whose contribution to the scriptural comments is most prolific. (Four other tractates will serve for a Table 4 Number of Scripture Comments Compared with Other Traditions (Law or Legal Commentary) Name of Exceptional No. of comments Other No. of comments Sage tractates per page tractates per page Rav Berakhot 12/42 Sukkah 3/34 Megillah 18/15 Eruvin 7/81 Sotah 18/16 Kiddushin 5/39 Sanhedrin 46/36 Hullin 6/82 Johanan Berakhot 31/49 Sukkah 4/23 Megillah 18/11 Eruvin 7/59 Sotah 26/10 Kiddushin 6/34 Sanhedrin 89/49 Hullin 9/114 Rava Berakhot 5/49 Sukkah 4/45 Megillah 25/27 Eruvin 8/58 Sotah 14/8 Kiddushin 8/49 Sanhedrin 28/85 Hullin 15/75</page><page sequence="11">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 11 comparison. If this same accounting were to be conducted in all tractates, it would be easily demonstrated that the numbers for these tractates are far more typical.) As shown in table 4, while there is some individual variation, it is certain, again, that the tractates that we have previously defined to be exceptional are in fact just that. They are the only tractates in which the contributions of major amoraic sages comprise an equal or greater quantity of scriptural comments. In other tractates, such traditions do not even begin to approach the number of legal or legal-commentary traditions. The norm, again it seems clear, is closer to Sukkah, and not to Sotah, Sanhedrin, Berachot, or Megillah. These latter, rather, are not typical, but are, with relation to the Bavli as a whole, out of the ordinary. For this conclusion to stand, it is not necessary that we be able to suggest why these tractates admitted different principles of overall composition. Even so, if we are able to venture a suggestion or two concerning why San- hedrin and Sotah are out of the ordinary, we will have gone some distance in explaining why the authors of these texts chose to set for themselves a task that was distinct, at times, from the one pursued in the rest of the Bavli. What, then, might the explanation be? The answer to this question would require a much lengthier study, but in a preliminary way we may sug- gest this: There is something about these tractates (what, we shall consider below) that generates the inclusion of usually lengthy, but quite distinct, excurses on Scripture. For example, something in Megillah elicited the inclusion in the latter part of chapter 1 of a lengthy commentary on parts of the "scroll" (megillah) of Esther, as well as other related scriptural texts. Notably, when one eliminates the number of scriptural comments attributed to Rav, Johanan, and Rava that are found in this block of text (O10b-17a), the number of scriptural comments in the tractate (attributed to the sages considered, out of a preliminary total of sixty-one) is only sixteen-far more typical of the Bavli in general. These blocks are in fact relatively unusual in the Bavli, and they are by no means distributed throughout. Rather, they are to be found, for the most part, in precisely the tractates that we have defined as exceptional. What then about these tractates precipitated the inclusion of these larger blocks devoted to scriptural exegesis? It seems most likely, when we examine the Mishnah paragraphs to which these texts are connected, that there is something in the character of the Mishnah that determined, for the most</page><page sequence="12">12 DAVID KRAEMER part, where these blocks were to be included. This may be demonstrated in a number of ways, including reference to the very numbers that Neusner gives. Distinguishing his "Scripture units of discourse" by their relationship to the "larger redactional purpose" of the gemara, Neusner lists those units of discourse that illustrate "a point of law or theology in the antecedent analy- tical composition" and those that are "autonomous of the point of law or theology in the antecedent analytical context" (pp. 102-4). In Sotah only 6 percent of the total units of discourse are fully autonomous Scripture units, in Sukkah only 1.2 percent, and in Sanhedrin (more significantly) 17.6 per- cent. In other words, in only a minority of cases does the Scripture unit of discourse serve needs that are totally independent of the Mishnah's agenda. In all other cases, even if it does not relate to the Mishnah directly, its inclu- sion is nevertheless generated by a "point of law or theology" that is itself directly related to the Mishnah. And even if we grant that in Sanhedrin Scripture is often addressed as a wholly independent focus of commentary, the 17.6 percent of its units that are fully autonomous Scripture units will still not allow us to claim that the Bavli is a Scripture commentary in the same measure that it is a Mishnah commentary. A further demonstration of the same conclusion will result from con- sidering directly the nature of the Mishnah at hand. Following, I have singled out those mishnaic portions which, by Neusner's accounting, have attracted the most Scripture units. Attention to their content is, with a few exceptions, telling. Sotah 1:1-2. Beginning of the discussion of the "jealousy" ceremony for the suspected wife. 1:8-9. An application of the "measure for measure" principle of justice to several biblical figures. Proof-texts are quoted. 7:1-6. Things to be recited in any tongue or in the holy tongue. Mishnah quotes proof-texts. 8:1. Same as above. 9:5-6. Ceremony for the "breaking of the neck of the heifer." Again, quota- tion from Scripture. 9:11-13. An accounting of the diminution of God's presence in this world, and of the world's quality, over the course of time. Explicit statement of rabbinic theology.</page><page sequence="13">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 13 Sukkah 4:9-10. The "water-pouring" celebration. Sanhedrin 1:1-6. The number of judges required for different cases. Proof-texts are quoted. 4:5. Warning to witnesses in capital cases. Discussion of meaning of creation of Adam. Quotation of scriptural texts. 6:2.

The "rebellious son"; proof-text. 11(10):1-3. Those with portions in the world-to-come and those excluded from the world-to-come. Proof-texts. In most of these cases, there is something about the Mishnah itself that is sufficiently unusual or provocative to have generated the inclusion of the scriptural block. To begin with, many of these quote two or more verses of Scripture in close proximity, a phenomenon that is rare in the Mishnah. Some tractates are entirely devoid of this phenomenon, such as Eruvin or Ketubot, and most others do so on only one or two occasions. Sotah and Sanhedrin, which include texts that are dense with quotations from Scrip- ture, stand apart in this regard, and it is reasonable to propose that this factor alone might engender the scriptural echo in the Bavli. But the pres- ence of scriptural quotations is only one element of a larger phenomenon, for these quotations tend to cluster around topics of particular interest in the rabbinic corpus. The matter of divine justice and its relation to biblical figures (and, by extension, to others) is the central theme at the beginning of Sotah. Rabbinic "historiography" is the theme at its end (where the conclu- sions, speaking of God's gradual withdrawal from contact with humanity, are in tension with the beginning of the tractate). Sanhedrin's discussion of the death penalty and of the value of human life, in connection with the model of Adam, is unusual in form and content for the Mishnah, and again is of unique interest in defining rabbinic ideology. The "rebellious son" is a difficult institution in the rabbinic world, and the Mishnah relating to it is usually dense in midrash halacha. Finally, the discussion of the world-to-</page><page sequence="14">14 DAVID KRAEMER come is not only unusual in form, but it also, of course, holds a crucial place in the rabbinic canon. In order to test the part played by the Mishnah and its precise character- istics in attracting Scripture units, it is instructive to consider the whole of Mishnah Sanhedrin and the characteristics of its individual parts, and to compare this description with the presence or absence of Scripture units in the gemara. In all of Mishnah Sanhedrin, the only texts that quote two or more verses of Scripture in close proximity are as follows: 1:1-6 (specifically 4 and 6), 2:4,'3 4:5, 6:2, 8:2, 8:4, and all of chapter 10(11). It is in connection with these Mishnah texts, and these alone, that the clusters of Scripture units of discourse that Neusner describes are to be found. That is not to say that they are all accompanied by such a cluster (2:4 and 8:4 are not). But that is not essential to the argument. What is crucial is that no text outside of these is accompanied by one. And even if elsewhere an occasional Scripture clus- ter is to be found in proximity to a Mishnah that does not share these features, deeper analysis would still probably yield, in many cases, less obvious but crucial connections to the Mishnah. Be that as it may, it is clear that the nature of the Mishnah may not be dismissed. At the very least, the nature of the Mishnah is highly influential in determining whether a cluster of Scripture units will accompany it in the gemara. On the basis of what we have seen, we have good reason to doubt whether Sotah and Sanhedrin, as opposed to Sukkah, can be considered representative of the Bavli as a whole. It appears likely, rather, that Sukkah is more typical, and that Sotah and Sanhedrin, in their inclusion of extended blocks of commentary on Scripture, are less so. This being the case, it is unnecessary to revise totally what I referred to earlier as the "traditional wisdom," that is, that the Bavli is primarily a commentary on and supple- ment to the Mishnah. What is necesssary, given the material that Neusner has drawn to our attention, is to add a footnote-to keep in mind that, despite the Bavli's general organizing principle, there are nevertheless rela- tively unusual but still significant blocks of text that follow the direction of Scripture and not of Mishnah. Scripture is only secondary as an indepen- dent concern of the Bavli, but it is one that should not be ignored. 13. Depending upon the reading of the Mishnah, 3:7 may or may not quote two. In any case, the two that might be quoted are nearly identical, rendering them, for present purposes, a single text.</page><page sequence="15">SCRIPTURE COMMENTARY IN THE BABYLONIAN TALMUD 15 This means, to begin with, that the Bavli, like the Yerushalmi, defines its task to be the broad explication of Mishnah. Its purpose and direction are largely dictated by that text, and, with some exceptions, the Mishnah's dis- placement of Scripture as the focus of extended inquiry is sustained in its pages. This is, however, no less profound a move than would have been the case if Mishnah and Scripture served side by side in the Bavli; which is more radical after all-implied equation or explicit displacement? On the other hand, these conclusions also suggest that the horizons of inquiry of the Bavli's authors were wider than those of their Palestinian counterparts. They were willing, from time to time, to diverge from the directions outlined in the Mishnah, and this independence is reflective of the spirit of the document as a whole. For even when the Mishnah is the spine of the Bavli's deliberation, the precise program that it pursues is wholly its own. The virtuosity with which this program is addressed, and the painstak- ing, convincing manner in which it is presented, may very well be at the root of the Bavli's final triumph.
