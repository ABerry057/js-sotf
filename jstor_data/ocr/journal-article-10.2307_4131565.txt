<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc (Menahem) Hirshman. Torah for the Entire World. Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1999. 189 pp. (Hebrew). Hirshman's cautious study promises a focus upon "a universalistic stream in the Tannaitic literature and its relationship to the wisdom of the nations." The "uni- versalism" he hopes to identify is a modest one: the notion that the Torah of Israel is intended ab origine to be a possession of all human communities (with some pointed exceptions, such as the Amalekites). On this score Hirshman delivers rather more than he promises. Not only does he identify a "universalistic school" of Tannaitic tradition. He locates it in a dis- tinctive priestly point of view represented in the Tannaitic corpus by tradents as- sociated with R. Ishmael (of priestly lineage), provides it with a Second Temple genealogy in such works as the Wisdom of ben Sira and the Testament of Levi, and traces its presence in a number of diverse Tannaitic halakhic concerns. These in- clude, among others, the role of converts in Israel, the status of Gentiles who per- form commandments, the validity of the Noahide Commandments, and the rel- evance of Greek wisdom to Jews. Hirshman selects his sources wisely and elucidates them with great sensitivity to literary, redactional, and historical con- texts. While it is always possible to challenge attempts to disentangle redacted Rab- binic compositions into the traditions that fed them or the social groups that trans- 127</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review mitted them, Hirshman's claim to find an ideologically coherent "universalistic school" circulating behind the dominant "particularism" of the Tannaitic (in Hirsh- man's view, "Aqiban") tradition stands upon many different strands of evidence. It will, I suspect, prove convincing to many stubborn textual positivists-such as this reviewer. Perhaps one of the most important contributions of Hirshman's isolation of this Ishmaelian "universalism" is the subtle way he unpacks its theological foun- dations. Tannitic "universalism" is hardly of the "I'm OK, you're OK" variety. Pre- cisely because the Torah was given to the entire world as well as to Israel, the world's rejection of the Torah places it under Divine judgment. This yields some interesting paradoxes. For example, converts and even non-converted Gentiles who study Torah or perform commandments are said to enjoy a priestly status; yet the validity of the Noahide Commandments is rejected, since non-Jews are invited, no less than Israel, to observe the entire Torah. Hirshman's treatment of the second theme of his subtitle-the relationship of this Tannaitic universalism to "the wisdom of the nations"-is also stimulating in its theological sensitivity. Here he seems to have at least two goals in mind: to explain how the "universalists" viewed the relationship of the Torah to other tra- ditions of human wisdom and to compare Tannaitic "universalism" to others in the cultural context of Late Antiquity. Here Hirshman is more suggestive than exhaustive. He convincingly shows, for example, that the "universalistic" view of Torah as a human, rather than a dis- tinctly Israelite, inheritance implied a rejection of "Greek wisdom" as an essential- ly illegitimate subject of study. Thus Tannaitic "universalism" did not translate into a curiosity about "human wisdom" per se. Here Hirshman pointedly distinguishes the Ishmaelian tradition from that promulgated by the Patriarchate, in which the cul- tivation of Greco-Roman rhetorical culture was regarded as a practical necessity with its own theological legitimations. Hirshman also points out an interesting dis- tinction between Tannaitic "universalism" and that of another Judaically-inspired "universalism" found in early Christianity. Christian "universalism," of course, was eschatological-expressed primarily in the extension of Israel's covenental privi- lege to all humanity, and grounded in the overcoming of the abiding validity of the Torah's commandments. By contrast, Tannaitic "universalism" remained this- worldly and anti-messianic, focusing on the incorporation of discerning individu- als into the abiding covenant represented by the commandments. Thus, even in the context of its "universalism," Tannaitic tradition remained firm in its essentially priestly sense of the solidity of communal borders. This review only touches upon the most readily summarized elements of Hirshman's work. The textual exegesis that yields his conclusions is itself of very great interest and justifies a speedy translation of the study into English. Martin S.
