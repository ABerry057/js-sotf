<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ruth Tsoffar. Stains of Culture: An Ethno-Reading of Karaite Jewish Women. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2006. xv, 245 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001529 Ruth Tsoffar's book, The Stains of Culture, is an ethnographic study of the Karaite community in San Francisco, California, with a special emphasis on women's experience. Numbering some 700 families, the community is composed of first- and second-generation immigrants from Egypt who left in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Tsoffar's fieldwork, primarily conducted in the early 1990s, involved interviews and focus group discussions with the women of the commu nity; participant observation at Sabbath morning services, which were held once a month in a space rented from a Conservative synagogue; and participation in a number of events held in the domestic sphere, including a Passover Seder. The particular focus of Tsoffar's inquiry?highlighted by the book's blood-red cover?is ritual practices surrounding menstruation. For a Karaite woman, niddah (separation) lasts for seven days of each month, starting with the day she begins to bleed. The niddah state is extended an additional seven days only in the event that her bleeding continues beyond the first seven. Unlike Rabbinite women, however, her status of niddah does not include an additional seven "clean-days" (counted from the time that the bleeding ends). Tsoffar details the various prohibitions observed by Karaite women when they are in a state of niddah and the cleansing ritual that releases them from that state. In addition, she discusses the ways in which Karaite mothers in Egypt (prior to the wave of emigration) initiated their daughters into the system of "bodily maintenance" surrounding menstruation. While readers may be interested to learn about these details of Karaite prac tices, they will inevitably ask, in this rare ethnography on contemporary Karaites, why the emphasis on women in particular, and why the tight focus on this 477</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews particular area of their lives? Tsoffar begins to answer this question in the book's introduction, where she explains that she chose to focus on menstruation and niddah following a conversation with a community leader during her first stages of research. It is "the issue today," Sophia?wife of the "acting rabbi" of the Karaite community in the Bay Area?advised her. Unfortunately for the reader, this tantalizing statement is never explored. Why is it "the issue"? And what exactly does it mean to be "the issue"? These questions hover over each chapter of the book without ever being appropriately answered or addressed. They are particularly pressing given the fact that the discussion about cul tural practices surrounding menstruation comes at the expense of almost all other information about the San Francisco Karaites. The reader learns little about the nature of the community: its leadership structure, social boundaries, group events, and friendship circles. Likewise, little information is presented about the lives that Karaite women lead outside of their menstrual practices. Do they work? What do they do in their spare time? In what kinds of homes do they live? With whom? How do they relate to their husbands, to their children, to other Karaite women, to Jews who are not Karaites, and to others? The question of why the tight focus on practices associated with menstrua tion and niddah is also pressing given the great difficulty Tsoffar encountered in her efforts to obtain information about the topic. Her conversations with women about these issues were often "embarrassing," she explains, and "filled with moments of hesitation, pauses, questioning looks, anxious laughter, perhaps even mistrust" (79). Indeed, the "mere mention of the subject made some women uncomfortable." Reflecting on her research, she writes, "In retrospect, I was not prepared for the experience of establishing contact with other women through ... talking about menstruation." Working my way through the book's dense jargon and tedious references to a long string of theorists, I have identified what seem to be the two reasons behind Tsoffar's choice of focus. The first is related to her broader interest in the study of Judaism as an embodied religion. This angle of analysis taps into a current, compelling trend in Jewish studies, recently identified by Barabara Kirschenblatt Gimblett as "the corporeal turn." Rituals surrounding niddah, which involve close monitoring of the most intimate recesses of the body, could hardly be a better site for this avenue of research. Furthermore, Tsoffar explains that knowledge about the details of these rituals are not learned through disembodied textual study; rather, they are transmitted from mother to daughter in the intimacy of the do mestic sphere. Tsoffar?I believe?sees this pattern of transmission as exemplary of Karaite culture, which rejects the Rabbinic accretions of knowledge that have built up through textual analysis, exposition, and study over the course of centuries in favor of a relatively unmediated relationship with the Torah itself. This theoretical point of departure calls for a highly engaged ethnography in which the anthropologist is very present, able to observe the enacting and transmission of culture in practice. Here, Tsoffar runs into a methodological flaw in her research, for attending services once a month and conducting interviews and focus group discus sions are simply not sufficient for the task that she has set before herself. How do mothers in San Francisco teach their daughters about the laws surrounding 478</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews menstruation and purification (relevant among Karaites for single women as well as married women)? While she interviews some women about their experiences in Egypt learning from their mothers, the reader gets no sense of how these traditions continue to be transmitted to the next generation (or not?) in their new homes. I believe a second reason for her focus on menstruation is Tsoffar's claim that the laws of niddah and purity have been central to the Karaite-Rabbinite divide. She explains, "In their attempts to legitimize self and delegitimize the other, historical Rabbinite accusations that Karaites are not 'pure' stem mainly from the fact that husband and wife resume marital relations following menstrua tion" without observing seven additional clean days. Furthermore, Karaite women do not immerse in a mikva (ritual bath) as do Rabbinite women but rather perform a purification ritual cdMt?yezikah (pouring). It is these divergences from Rabbinic practice?Tsoffar claims?that brought Rabbi David Ibn Zimra, sixteenth-century religious scholar and leader of Egypt's Rabbinite community, to characterize Karaite men as bo 'alei niddot (those who have sexual intercourse with menstruat ing women). The effect of this label, Tsoffar argues, was a "staining" of the entire Karaite community (hence the title of her book). Niddah, she claims, thus "encap sulates the power struggle between the Karaites and the Rabbinites" and becomes a critical element in the definition of Karaite identity. Despite Tsoffar's argument, it is not clear from the historical data that niddah was, in fact, the critical fissure in Karaite-Rabbinite relations. Indeed, the Rabbinite argument that Karaites were unfit marriage partners did not stem from their status as bo 'alei niddot. Rather, they were all deemed potential mamzerim (products of an adulterous or incestuous relationship)?and hence not fit for marriage?on account of the fact that their divorce practices were deemed (by the rabbis) to be illegitimate. Putting aside this technical argument, for the moment: If the effort is to draw on the study of menstrual practices as a means to study relationship between Karaites and Rabbinites, this relationship must then be explored. And yet, no attention is given to the Karaites' relationships with contemporary Rabbinite Jews. Indeed, the reader is simply left to wonder if they have any contact at all with Jews who are not Karaites, as no mention is made of their relationship to the members of the Con servative synagogue from which they rent space, or to any Jews beyond this realm. In short, Tsoffar identifies two essential aspects of Karaite identity in the book's introduction: their "intimate and organic relationship to the Bible," and the "Karaites' specific minority position within the dominant culture, especially the Rabbinite culture." The study of niddah may have the potential to serve as a vehicle for exploring these aspects of identity. Unfortunately, in Stains of Culture, this potential is not achieved. Alanna E.
