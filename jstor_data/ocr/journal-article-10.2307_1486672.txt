<plain_text><page sequence="1">David S. Katz, The Jews in the History of England, 1485-1850. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994, xv, 447 pp. Anglo-Jewish history has been heavily rewritten since Todd Endelman of the University of Michigan produced his prize-winning study, The Jews of Georgian England, 1714-1830 (Philadelphia, 1979), identifying England and not Germany as the correct source of modern emancipation. Since then, under the influence of labor, feminist, and ethnic history, revising has become a central activity for other scholars. Tone, attitude, and purport have been transformed since the passing of a generation (or two) whose story of the Jews of England was a narration of upward social mobility, economic success, surburbanization, and British-style respectability. It was once a classic Victorian story of self-help, the triumph of organization and determination over indigence and prejudice, and the refinement of a "modern" form of religious orthodoxy. Not only the English Jews but the English generally earned credit for these achievements, since English culture itself was the final cause. This story still contains much truth. It would be well to remember that; but it is no longer the only tale. The new one is far less adulatory. It knocks communal leaders off pedestals. It reveals human frailty. It shares with muckraking journalists a nose for the unpleasant, Tartuffian conduct, hidden agendas, and cover-ups. The very concept of "national" history is challenged. "Toleration" is considered problematical, "emancipation" a clouded issue. A skeptical attitude prevails, although for largely political reasons patriotic writings are often appearing outside the research academy in Britain and America. The benefit of the current analytical approach is that it uses both narrow and major issues to reveal unresolved cultural difficulties in the life history of nations. The point is reemphasized in the new historiography because some well-known historians of Britain continue to belie its utility. Consequently</page><page sequence="2">170 BOOK REVIEWS books such as David Katz's take a strong stand. They explore the entanglement of self-defined or perceived minorities with majorities in order to consider the broadest implications of the relationship for both. The size of the group is insignificant. As Katz so well exemplifies in the best parts of his book, which are all in the first half, taking us from Henrician England through the seventeenth century, English kings and leaders were obsessed with Jews despite their minuscule numbers. The reasons kept shifting. Henry VIII sought Jewish scholarly opinion on the halakhah of divorce, Cromwell was less interested in the economic advantages of admitting Dutch Jews than in the millenarian implications of Puritan theology, toleration was not really a value in itself but a political tactic to stabilize shaky thrones like the one occupied by James II. David Feldman's smashing book, Englishmen and Jews: Social Relations and Political Culture, 1840-1914 (New Haven, 1994), demonstrates this approach to perfection. He shows how granting Jews the national vote was less of an issue for the English than the necessity to reconfigure nationhood and church-state relations in the face of the overall changing political environment of the mid-nineteenth century. Katz stops his narrative at about 1850-60. The eighteenth- and nineteenth- century parts of his story are generally familiar. The Jew Bill of 1753, the strange events associated with Lord George Gordon, who converted to Judaism, the work of the English evangelicals, the formation of the leading instruments of Jewish self-government are standard features of Anglo-Jewish history, but as Katz writes engagingly and is good at locating peculiar facts, he always has something to say. There are absorbing stories within stories. Personalities rise and fall, but mainly they fall. Katz remains cool and detached for the most part, although at times he displays his open irritation with unseemly Jewish conduct. His overall picture is not flattering to Jews or Christians. The latter more or less retain their prejudices, excepting the Georgian royal Duke of Sussex, who is so often called a philosemite that one begins to suspect there are no others. Jews come across as converso double agents, intriguers, charlatans, deal-makers, Faganesque thieves, caught up in an English and international world of intrigue, quackery, opportunism, and deal-making, and as such continually in the news, as well as in the minds but not hearts of Christian observers. Georgian Anglicans were fascinated and repelled by the absence of ritual decorum in Jewish services, and by the compromised spirituality and petty corruptions of synagogue leaders, as if these, or other less edifying features, were absent from their own religious communions. (Endelman's analysis of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 171 Georgian Jewish communities covers very similar ground.) None of Katz's discussion is really softened by an account of the richness and complexity of Jewish interior life made all the more complex, and perhaps richer or in some respects even more admirable, precisely because of the contradictions imposed from the outside. There is little piety among the pious, little about how common folk struggle to maintain some articles of faith or try to resolve the dilemmas and challenges of comparative personal liberty. Since the new story, like the older one, is also true, we cannot avert our eyes. But it is not the case that suddenly we have been brought up short by accounts of snobbery, bigotry, deceit, and exploitation, since only the naive could expect these traits to disappear. It is rather the weighting that we are to assign to the underside of triumphant history, the degree to which it replaces what at one time fell under the heading of the history of rationalism understood as rational behavior. Is this book, therefore, possibly an accurate reflection of the great ambiva- lence of world Jewry at the moment, wondering with the prophets whether they can be a light unto the nations, desperately yearning, at the same time, to fulfill the Zionist dream of being (merely) a people like any other-and disappointed with both alternatives?
