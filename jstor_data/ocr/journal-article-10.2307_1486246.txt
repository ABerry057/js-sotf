<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW LIGHT ON THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO by NORMAN ROTH Medieval Spain represents a unique phenomenon in the history of Jewish civilization. Not only did the Jews live longer in Spain than in any other land in their history (indeed, almost as long as they occupied their homeland in the land of Israel from Abraham to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.), but the Jewish population of medieval Spain was greater than that of all other lands combined, and the rich achievements of Jewish culture there were unequaled elsewhere. Of all the cities in Spain which served as major centers of Jewish life and culture, Toledo perhaps stands out as the most important. Studies dealing with Jewish life in Spain have recognized this, and the long-awaited appearance of a recent two-volume work in Spanish devoted to the Jews of Toledo has helped focus attention once again on the vast archival material available.' This article is an expanded version of a paper presented at the American Catholic Historical Association conference, Dec. 28, 1984. 1. Pilar Le6n Tello, Los judios de Toledo, 2 vols. (Madrid, 1979). The collection of Mozarabic documents, in Arabic and Hebrew, which will be frequently cited here is Angel 189</page><page sequence="2">190 NORMAN ROTH However, neither that work (essentially only a synopsis of published and unpublished archive sources, with a few illustrative texts) nor others (Newman, Baer, and various Spanish studies) have sufficiently or adequate- ly utilized the extant published sources dealing with Mozarabic Toledo and the Jews in that community. The present study is the first to fully examine these documents, which, since they are in Arabic (and some in Hebrew), could not have been examined by those who did not understand the lan- guage. The editor of the four volumes of Mozarabic documents provided brief and often incorrect Spanish summaries of the texts, with many errors in transcription of names, etc., from which it is not even possible to distinguish clearly which documents deal with Jews. In addition to these documents, the value of which has not been fully realized, there are also a number of other sources, Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew, which have never been consulted and which shall be utilized in this study. As is well known, Baer, for instance, made only the most casual and infrequent use of Hebrew sources in general for his history of the Jews in Spain. These sources include chronicles, responsa, poetry, and other material. What results from an analysis of all the extant sources is a new and more complete picture than any we have had so far of the Jewish community of Toledo for the Mozarabic period. The term Mozarabic, derived from Arabic mustd'rib (which means "to live like-follow the customs of-Muslims"), refers to non-Muslims living in essentially a Muslim society and adopting the Arabic language and many Muslim customs. It is a term unique to medieval Spain, and covers a very broad period, dating almost from the Muslim conquest (711) to at least the end of the thirteenth century when most of the Christian Reconquest of Muslim Spain had been completed. The phenomenon itself is primarily of interest with regard to the Christian communities of Muslim Spain, chiefly Toledo, where the use of Arabic for both spoken and written language by the Christians was thus unusual, and the impact even on Christian religious beliefs and liturgy created serious problems of heterodoxy and heresy for the Church. Jews, of course, utilized Arabic as well as Hebrew for their writings, and as their spoken language, throughout the Muslim world. Nevertheless, Jews in the Mozarabic centers of Spain were in close social and business contact with Christians and Muslims and thus shared in the general cultural milieu. Linguistically too, even allowing for some undoubtedly erroneous transcriptions of the published documents, it is obvious that there existed a Gonzalez Palencia, ed., Los Mozdrabes de Toledo en los siglos XII y XIII, 4 vols. (Madrid, 1926-30) (hereafter cited as Mozdrabes).</page><page sequence="3">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 191 dialectical branch of Arabic, termed Mozarabic Arabic (the existence, much less the nature of which, has not even been imagined by scholars of Judeo- Arabic), which was utilized also by the Jews of Toledo. We shall first examine the physical character of the Jewish quarters in Toledo, about which we have more detailed documentation than any other city. Following this, we shall investigate what our sources reveal concerning some of the important Jewish courtiers and officials of Toledo, and finally some of the prominent Jewish families. In Hebrew, the city was called Toletolah, under the influence of Arabic, but ostensibly derived from Isaiah 22:17: "Hinneh YHVH me-tallelkha taltelah gaver" ("Behold, the Lord will thrust you out with a mighty thrust"), which the Jews, ever eager to find biblical allusions to their exile in Spain, took to be a reference to Toledo.2 Following the severe persecution of the Jews in the Visigothic era (sixth century to the Muslim conquest in 711), and the forced conversion of most of the Jews, the population would have declined to insignificance were there not a replenishment from outside the country. Fortunately, we do not need merely to postulate such an influx of migration, for it is confirmed by the usually reliable Muslim historian al-Razi, who, after relating the forced conversion of the Jews under the Visigothic king Sisebut (613), continues: "And other Jews outside the land of Spain came to settle [the places] which these [Jews in Spain] had left" because of the persecution.3 While we know nothing about the Jewish population of Toledo until nearly the middle of the eleventh century, judging from the case of other Jewish settlers in al-Andalus (Muslim Spain), we may surmise that they came from North Africa and Babylon (Iraq) especially. As we have observed elsewhere, there was a strong feeling of "national- 2. Abraham Ibn Daud, the first Jewish historian in medieval Spain and himself a resident of Toledo, used this spelling in his chronicle, Sefer ha- Qabbalah, The Book of Tradition, ed. and trans. Gerson D. Cohen (Philadelphia, 1967), text, p. 53, etc. It is also found in the responsa of early rabbis of Muslim Spain, such as Isaac al-Fdsi, Joseph Ibn Megash, Moses b. Maimon (Maimonides), and in numerous other Jewish sources. On the connection with the passage in Isaiah, we have direct evidence only from later authoirities, such as Asher b. Yebiel, rabbi of the community of Toledo in the fourteenth century, and Isaac Abravanel in the fifteenth (see, e.g., his commentary on I Kings 10:22); yet there are hints to it already in a poem of Judah ha-Levy. Neither the commentaries of Abraham Ibn Ezra nor of David Qimbi (who lived in Toledo) on Isaiah offer any comment. Toledo can have no symbolic relation to Hebrew toldot ("genera- tions"), as Le6n Tello, Losjudios, 1:4, suggests, because the Hebrew name for Toledo is spelled with a tet, whereas toldot is spelled with a tav. 3.

Just as in Muslim writing this often focused as well on the superiority even of particular cities in al- Andalus, so we find Judah al-Harizi, a Hebrew poet of the early thirteenth century, writing of Toledo that it is the place "where the tribes have gone up, the tribes of the Lord." This is a direct reference to Psalm 122:4, which, however, is talking about Jerusalem!4 In a recent book, it has also been demonstrated that the famous scholar and later chief rabbi of Castile, Meir Abulafia, signed one of his manuscripts with some cryptic letters, the abbreviation for "God is in her midst, she shall not be moved, God will help her at the dawn of day" (Psalm 46:6), here meant as a reference to Toledo.5 Like all Spanish cities, Toledo was divided into barrios, or neighbor- hoods. It is best to use this term, attested in our sources, rather thanjuderia ("Jewish quarter"), for these were not exclusively Jewish neighborhoods at any time. Christians and Muslims, as well as Jews, lived in these neighbor- hoods, just as Jews also lived in other neighborhoods of the city. The largest of these was the adarve de la Sueca (or Assuica, derived from Arabic suwayqa, a diminutive of saq-i.e., a small marketplace), which was connected with the adarve of Ibn Zardal, or Zardiel (not "Abazardiel," this was a Jewish family of importance) by a passage from the barrio of bab al-yahad ("Gate of the Jews" in the wall of Toledo) to the plaza of Santo Tom6.6 Another important quarter was the rabad al-yahad, or "Jewish quarter" 4.

While most of the papers in the two-volume Simposio Toledojudaico (Madrid, 1972) are disappointing in quality, Julio Porres Martin-Cleto, "Los barrios judios de Toledo" (vol. 1, pp. 45-75), is quite informative. Neither he nor the scholars he cites (p. 47), however, have appar- ently seen the fundamental study of Leopoldo Torres Balbis, "Plazas, zocos y tiendas de las ciudades hispanomusulmanes," Al-Andalus 12 (1947), especially pp. 461-462. Note also the "tendis de halhanates que sunt in vico Judeorum" mentioned in a document of Alfonso VIII (1183), cited by Gonz1lez Palencia, Mozdrabes, 1:76, n. 1 (this also escaped the notice of Torres). Here, there can be no doubt that this word derives from Arabic hdanat, "stores," i.e., a marketplace. Were it not for the unquestioned authority of Torres, I would venture another etymology for Alcana, however: Arabic al-kann, a place of shelter, or al-kunna, an awning, and thus a marketplace (covered by awnings). For the adarve de la Sueca, see Mozdrabes, 1:75; Torres Balbis, "Plazas, zocas y tiendas," p. 450 (it must be located near the "Puerta de Assuica" on the map in Martin-Cleto, "Los barrios judios," p. 71, no.1).</page><page sequence="6">194 NORMAN ROTH (meaning that mostly Jews did live here), and it is this which is called the arrabal in Spanish documents. It was the most famous, and probably the oldest, Jewish neighborhood of the city. One may still visit the site of this quarter today. It is bounded on the east by the Barrio de San Romdn, on the west by the Barrio de San Tome'. The "upper arrabal" was separated by an adarve (here meaning a flat-topped wall) from the Barrio de San Romdn. It is virtually identical with the present Barrio nuevo, apparently.' A section in this quarter was known as Acaba, which is obviously Arabic 'aqaba, meaning not "hill" (as Gonzalez Palencia thought), but "steep road," which led to the plaza of Ab: Sulayman Ibn Sfsan (we shall later discuss this important family), near which was an adarve (here, "alley" or street with no exit, the gates of which could be closed at night for protection)8 of the eminent al-Barjilfni family, which is mentioned often in the documents and must have originated in Barcelona. Below the Acaba was the jabal al-ku!bl ("mountain of antimony," kohl; but there was also a Jewish family called Ibn al-Kabal, and it is possible that this is the actual name).9 Between these two points, running from the Acaba to Jabal al-kubl, was the adarve of Abgalon.'o Another Jewish neighborhood was that of Bab al-purtiel (Alportiel on maps and other Spanish documents), near which was the synagogue of the Almalaqin (so, not "Almaliquim"), which means "from Malaga," possibly referring to the city of origin of the early members of the synagogue. It was built by David b. Solomon Ibn Abf Durham, a famous name in Jewish history (a probable member of the family composed a work on Jewish liturgy), with members living all over Spain." The synagogue was con- structed in the late thirteenth century, or possibly even earlier.'2 7. Mozdrabes 3, no. 605.

Jews owned, and lived in, many castles in medieval Spain. Some of these castles were large enough to have houses within the fortified walls, and this was the case with the Jewish castle of Toledo, as can be seen from a document of 1163.14 As to the houses themselves, the documents provide us with no insights. Yet they undoubtedly were like the typical Muslim house in Spain at this period, about which we have learned much, and several of which still stand (as do Jewish houses, but of a slightly later period). A particularly pro- minent feature of these houses were what the Muslims called qurrdldt (patios), which has survived in Castilian as corrales or corrals (and in American English with a slightly different meaning, of course). All of the known extant Muslim houses in Spain (some twenty-eight were known by 1955) have these patios.15 Jewish houses of the later period also have them. The house surrounded the courtyard, and some houses had more than one courtyard (as many as eight in some cases, and one even with fourteen!). Gardens were grown inside these, and gardens also separated the houses from each other. Tall adobe walls separated the houses from the streets. The houses were usually of two stories; the lower story had a high ceiling to 47-48. Cantera apparently believed that the synagogue might have been built earlier than the thirteenth century, but gave no reason for this. 13. For the location, see Martin-Cleto's map, p. 71, no. 4. 14. Mozdrabes 4, no. 1135 (all documents are Arabic, unless otherwise stated). On the map in Martin-Cleto, "Los barrios judios," p. 71, no. 5, a "Castillo de losjudios" is indicated, but not whether it is the "new" or the "old" castle of the Jews. Apparently it is the latter, since Gonziles Palencia says this was located "over" (near) the Tajo River (Mozdrabes, 1:76). In 1163, a Christian qa'id (military commander) loaned 170 gold coins (mithqdls) to the Jew Isbaq Ibn Abf Yfisuf, the security for which included two houses in the Jewish barrio, some property, and part of another home he owned with his brother in the Jewish castle (ibid., 4, no. 897). I have elsewhere delivered a paper on Jewish castles in Spain, which may yet appear in print. 15. Details on the extant Muslim houses in Al-Andalus 2:380-387, 9:173-190 and 469-475.

Two men were partners in a house (probably renting it out for income) which is said to have a courtyard 30 X 28 "fists," and the house had one room 68 "fists" long and one smaller room 18 "fists" (about 9 feet if we estimate 6 inches for a "fist," a rabbinical unit of measure).17 As is generally the case with medieval Spain, it is extremely difficult to estimate population with any degree of accuracy. With regard to Jewish population figures in Spain generally, we can make only educated guesses. The best estimate for the total population of Toledo at the end of the eleventh century is around 37,000.1s The important, and usually informed, fifteenth-century Jewish astronomer and chronicler Abraham Zakut (sometimes written Zacuto, incorrectly) cites the testimony of Abraham b. Natan of Lunel (d. 1215), who lived in Toledo, that there were more than 12,000 Jews in the city. This seems quite probable. Certainly the Christian chronicler Juan Gil de Zamora's statement (thirteenth century) that there were 70,000 Jewish taxpayers in Toledo is erroneous (perhaps he meant the entire province, and not just the city).19 16.

Goitein, A Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, The Family (Berkeley, 1978), gives no satisfactory data or conclusions on population, but leaves the impression that four to six sons in a family were not uncommon, whereas there are insufficient data on daughters to enable any guess (pp. 237-240). This would have to be a corrective to Torres Balbis's estimate of an average of six persons to a (Muslim) family. We must not forget that Jewish families tended to be large.

Another indication of the relatively large Jewish population of Toledo is the presence of numerous synagogues. This is already confirmed in the previously cited statement of the poet Judah al-Harizi, who, after praising the "Princely City," concludes: "What beautiful palaces are in her that put to shame the luminaries with the splendor of their beauty and loveliness. And how many synagogues are in her whose beauty is incomparable."21 How many synagogues, indeed? At least eleven are known to have existed. One of these, the "great synagogue," was destroyed by a fire in 1250 (not, let me hasten to add, by Christians!). Of the other ten, only the pre- viously mentioned synagogue of the Almdlaqin and the "new" synagogue (later converted into the famous Church of Santa Maria la Blanca, now a national monument and one of the three most beautiful Spanish synagogues still standing) can be said definitely to have existed in the thirteenth century or before. The others are all mentioned in the sources of the fourteenth or fifteenth century.22 Still, it is doubtful that al-H arizi would have praised the "many" synagogues of the city if there were only three. Undoubtedly there were others whose names we do not know, or it may be that some of those known from later sources were in fact built earlier.

Ashtor, however, correctly criticizes those, like Baer,who rely on tax lists for population estimates (p. 35). Not only are these figures liable to change significantly from year to year, as he observed, but they are also very incomplete and even inaccurate. Ashtor's own figures should be used with caution. 21. Tabkemoni, as cited in n. 4 above; I use here the generally reliable translation by Victor Reichert (Jerusalem, 1965, 1973), 2:98. 22.

Indeed, it is puzzling to find the legal historian Garcia-Gallo claiming that even though this is true, the Jews maintained themselves apart "without mixing with the rest of society."23 Unless this refers to religious separatism-i.e., the Jews maintained their own religious laws and observances-it is difficult to explain the apparent contradiction between this statement and the facts known to us. Nevertheless, conditions were not always amicable in Jewish-Christian relations in Toledo. In 1108, on the feast of the Assumption of Mary (August 15), the Anales Toledanos report briefly a massacre of the Jews.24 This became the basis for a legend, a miracle tale known as "Toledo," which was widely circulated in the Marial tales (miracles of the Virgin) in the Middle Ages and is found in Spain in the Liber Mariae of Juan Gil de Zamora, the Milagros of Berceo, and the Cantigas de Santa Maria com- posed by anonymous poets at the court of Alfonso X of Castile.25 A law of Alfonso VII, in the fuero of Toledo of 1118, states that any Castilian who wishes to leave the city and return to his own forum (domain?) 23.

"Mataron A los Judios en Toledo dia de Domingo, Vispera de Santa Maria de Agosto, Era MCXLVI" (Espaiia sagrada, ed. Enrique Fl6rez [Madrid, 1767], 23:386). Fita, in his dis- cussion of Juan Gil de Zamora's tale (see following note), thought the date was in error, for he claimed that August 15 was on a Saturday in 1108, and therefore he suggested 1109, after the death of Alfonso VI. Juan Francisco Rivera Recio, La iglesia de Toledo en el siglo XII (Rome, 1966), 1:57, objected to Fita's conclusions, but he himself mistakenly places the feast on August 14. In fact, it is August 15, which was on a Sunday in 1108, and there is thus no reason to make any changes. Vincent of Beauvais. Speculum historiale (Graz, 1965), 8: lxxxi, erroneously gave the date 1080 (his account is totally legendary, one of the "tale" versions). Garcia-Gallo, apparently unaware either of the actual event or of the literary versions or of Rivera Recio's discussion, independently came to the conclusion that the law referred to below in the article had to do with an event in the reign of Alfonso VI; and this is correct (op. cit., p. 357). 25.

Indeed, in light of this law, it is peculiar to find the Jewish chronicler Abraham Ibn Daud of Toledo, writing in 1160/61, calling Alfonso "a righ- teous king"; perhaps Ibn Daud knew that the young ruler was not actually responsible for the law.28 Nevertheless, thefuero was confirmed by Alfonso VII again in 1174, when he had certainly attained his majority. In addition to the pardon granted those apparently involved in the massacre, the fuero continues: 26. Because of the difficulty of the text, I give here the original Latin text of thefuero and the Spanish translation (in the confirmation by Fernando III in 1222): si aliquis Castellanus ad suum forum ire volverit, vadat, et super hoc totum, exaltet Dominus imperium suum, dimissit illis omnia peccata, que acciderunt de occisione judeorum, et de rebus illorum, et de totis perquisitionibus tam maioribus, quam minoribus.

Thus, there is no doubt that there was tension between Jews and Chris- tians at this time, and these laws reflect some of the harshest attitudes against Jews found in post-Visigothic Spanish legal codes. In a document from the Jewish council of Toledo, dated 1112 (cited in a responsum of Ibn Megash), there is a reference to Joseph b. Moses Ibn Qapsus (or Qapsos), who had been killed, with the formula of benediction added: "May God avenge his blood." This undoubtedly refers to the above- mentioned massacre.30 In another responsum of Ibn Megash, there is a refer- ence to some houses taken from their former Jewish owners in Toledo and given to the soldiers of the governor of the city (or perhaps soldiers of the king). "Joseph ha-nasi Cidillah" (Joseph Ibn FerruSiel, about whom more later) had been placed in charge of the property of the goverment (mdl al- sultan). One of the houses in question thus came into his possession, and there was debate as to who was the rightful Jewish owner of the house. Ibn 29. On the meaning of this term (nuper renatus; not "super" as in the abridged version in Le6n Tello, Judios de Toledo, 2:6, no. 8), see Muhioz's note to the Latin text, p. 365. The Spanish confirmation (above, n. 26) omits any reference to "recent converts," perhaps because they no longer understood the meaning of the Latin expression mentioned (the text of the Spanish version is, in any case, very inaccurate, as Muhoz already noted). The dates of the confirma- tions are 1174 (not 1176) and 1222 (not 1226); most of the conversions of Era dates to A ho dates in Mufioz are incorrect. Garcia-Gallo apparently had an erroneous text, according to which Jews and Muslims were allowed to hold public office over Christians! He expressed his surprise at this, which he thought was without precedent (it would be if the text said this); cf. his "Los fueros de Toledo," p. 357. 30. Cited in Moses b.

Not knowing Hebrew, she could not consult the actual sources and thus did not realize that there is no such number in the responsa of Ibn Migash, and that the responsum in fact does not appear in his responsa at all, but only as cited in Maimonides).</page><page sequence="13">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 201 Ferru$iel gave the house to one of the Jewish litigants "to lease it out for the tax of the government."3' Thus, the Jewish owner, or at least the one who claimed to be the owner, would receive some financial benefit from the pro- perty. The editors of this important text suggest that the most probable time for these events was the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI in 1085.32 However, this is not likely. The text says that these houses were taken, along with other houses of the Jews, at the time of the persecution (al-jaur, "outrage, oppression"). We know of no such persecution at the time of the conquest (about which we have considerable detail), but the term certainly would fit the massacre of the Jews in Toledo in 1108. Also, Ibn Megash, the rabbi to whom the complicated question is addressed, was only eight years old in 1085. It is difficult to imagine that he would be asked, many years later, about an event that took place when he was still a child. There are other interesting historical details in the question itself. The litigant who claimed to be the original owner of the house says he bought it from a Jew who bought it from a Christian, and that he paid the sum of 15 mithqdls (gold dinars) for it. This seems a very low price, when we consider that a pound of "good quality" floss-silk is said to have cost about 9?3/ mithqdls in Spain in 1138, and that in the eleventh century in Cordoba houses ranged in price from 50 to as high as 280 mithqdls.33 It is also very significant that the question refers to the enactment of the Jewish community that if someone purchased a house from a Christian, and it is then discovered it actually belonged to a Jew, he must bring proof that he had so purchased it and then may receive the return of his purchase price 31. "Shemoneh Teshuvot" (see above, n. 17), Arabic text, p. 172; trans., pp. 181-82. Admittedly the phrase la-mirkan fihd ta'am al-sultan is difficult, but I would suggest that the root of the first word is kariya, one of the meanings of which is "lease, rent out," and ta'dm (usually "food") also can mean "tax" in medieval Arabic. The alternative would be to under- stand it as "preparing food for the government," as the editors tentatively translate, but this does not seem to fit the context (besides, what benefit would there be for the Jewish claimant in this?). 32.

Thus, apparently, it was a common occurrence that houses were seized from Jews during the massacre. The Mozarabic documents of Toledo edited by Gonzilez Palencia are a mine of information on the Jews of Toledo and their relations with Chris- tians, and yet they have never been properly explored. One cannot examine merely the Hebrew documents, in the volume edited by the great Spanish Hebraist Millis Vallicrosa, nor can one rely on the often incorrect and incomplete Spanish summaries of the Arabic documents. It is impossible to determine whether one of these deals with Jews or not without carefully reading the text itself, and even then one must have a thorough acquaintance with Jewish names (often almost indistinguishable from Arabic) in medieval Spain. What we learn from a careful examination of the documents in these four massive volumes is that relations between Jews and Christians in Toledo in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were on the whole extremely cordial (this was true as well elsewhere in Spain). They engaged in joint business ventures and sold property to each other. A Christian widow sold property on behalf of her minor children to a Jew (1204; 2:331 [citations will give the date, then the volume and page of the document]). Jews frequently sold houses in the Jewish quarters to Christians, and even to the cathedral. The wazir ("vizier") Abo Harfin Msfis al-Isra'flf ShabaS (or Shabat; in Spanish, "Abenxaat") and his wife Sitt Bona (a common name for Jewish women, in Arabic sitt means "lady") sold some property to the archbishop- elect Ruy Jim6nez de Rada), the purchase price being saved by the seller to cover a debt he owed the deceased archbishop Pedro Martin (Martin Lbpez de Pisuerga, who died sometime late in 1208 or early 1209; our document is dated October of 1208 [2:373]). Now, these are quite famous figures in medieval Spanish history, yet the existence of these documents (or the identity of the figures in them) has not hitherto been noted or suspected. The abbess of the convent of San Clemente gave the Jew Ibrahim b. Isma'll al-Balansi ("of Valencia") a store which the convent had acquired from another Jew living in Talavera, in exchange for another store in that city owned by the said Ibrahim (1210; 4:808). We hear again of transactions between the archbishop Rodrigo Jim6nez de Rada and Jews, as when a member of the renowned al-BarjilOni family, Abu'l-IHasan Benjamin b. Abi Ishaq, acted as agent for the archbishop to purchase some property (1244; 3:564). Nor was Ibn al-ShabaS the only Jew who dealt with the previous archbishop, for the wealthy Abu 'Umar (Joseph) Ibn Sfsan sold</page><page sequence="15">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 203 some farm land and vineyards in Olias to the archbishop Martin L6pez (1205; 2:344, cf. 335).34 A summary of a Hebrew document of sale is given in Arabic, in a trans- action between Jews and Christians (3:648; it is unfortunate that the editor left out the "various signatures in Hebrew," but the names of the Jews are known from the text itself). In 1246, Benjamin al-Barjiluni was appointed administrator of the houses owned by the cathedral chapter of Toledo (2:572). A very unusual document apparently indicates that a Christian died without relatives, and his property was divided between a Jew who lived in Cordoba and a female servant of the deceased! Two slaves had already been sold to the brother of the Jew (4:1003). A Christian in Villa de Muelas (Villamuelas, east of Toledo) sold a vine- yard to pay a debt to a Jew (3:711, 4:888). When a Jew and his wife rented some land and vineyards from the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Toledo in 1217, one of the conditions of the long-term agreement (five years) was that if an armed troop (Arabic mah.alla, a unique term; cf. also 4:1065, possibly from ball, as modern Arabic juyush mubtalla, "occupation forces") of Christians or Muslims should attack and destroy over half of the property, the loss was to be borne by the Cathedral (4:910). One can scarcely imagine such a contract anywhere else in medieval Europe. Loans between Jews and Christians were frequent. A wealthy Christian stipulated in his will that a debt be repaid to Abil 'Umar Ibn Nabmias (1268; 4:1030). The wife of a Christian judge loaned 50 mithqdls of gold to the Jew Ishlaq Ibn al-Jabir and his wife Jamila (1209; 4:834). We have already noted that ibn al-Shaha$ borrowed money from the archbishop, Martin L6pez. Thus, not only was Spain unusual in that Christians repaid loans to Jews, but Jews frequently borrowed from Christians. Not all debts were repaid, however, and sometimes the matter had to be brought to court, as in a case in 1262 where a respected Christian notable represented a Jew in a Christian court in claims against a Christian who had 34. Maurice, archdeacon of Toledo, bought property on behalf of the newly elected arch- bishop on April 5, 1208 (first recorded mention of him as archdeacon); cf. the Arabic document in Mozdrabes, 2:373. We can trace the acquisition of the property of Ibn Sfisan: ibid., 2:276, 279, 280, 284, and 290, and this is rare documentation of the growing wealth of one Jewish notable.</page><page sequence="16">204 NORMAN ROTH not repaid his loans. The Christian judge found in favor of the Jew, and gave the debtor nine days to repay the loans. The time passed without repay- ment, and it came to court again. The judge ordered the debtor's movable goods sold to meet the debt, but the amount was insufficient, and the judge ordered his house sold also. Only one offer to purchase was made, by a Jew, for the exact amount of the debt. When the debtor promised to produce a higher offer for the house, time was granted to do so, but when no other buyer could be found, it was sold to the Jew with the stipulation that he pay its full value.3" The entire procedure in this case goes against all assumptions concerning the conditions of medieval Jews. Usually, every effort was voluntarily made to repay debts to Jews. Thus, the convent of Santo Domingo sold some property in order to pay a debt due to the "Jewess Mukakasa" (1251; 3:580). Spain differed in this respect as well, as our documents and other sources attest, in that Jewish women were frequently in business either alone or as partners with their husbands. In another case, a Jew was unable to repay his loan from the daughter of a Christian judge, and she took possession of the house which was surety (1209; 4:834). One of the most interesting examples of a loan by a Christian to a Jew is that of a military commander (qd'id, incorrectly spelled in the text) in the enormous amount of 170 mithqdls, for which the Jew gave as surety two well-known houses, vineyards, land, etc., and his part of a house that he owned with his brother in the Jewish castle (1163; 4:897). Another large loan (3,000 mithqdls of silver) by a Christian judge to a Jew for the pur- pose of investing in merchandise is indicative of typical partnerships. Two- thirds of the profit was to go to the Christian (in addition to repayment of the loan), and in the event that repayment was not made after a year, an additional 20 mithqdls a day was to be due. In this case, the Jew did not repay and the case went to court, where the Jew was ordered to sell a house, a store, and its upper dwelling section (1294; 4:965). Here, it is necessary to explain that the use of gentile courts by Jews was strictly prohibited, in theory, by rabbinic law.36 Nevertheless, Jews in 35. 4:959; cf. also no. 964. For a similar case, see there no. 960, where in spite of a compli- cated procedure involving a house kept as surety and finally sold, the Jewish lender never fully recovered his debt. 36. In strictly talmudic law, the use of gentile courts was permitted (cf. M. Gittin 1:5), but medieval authorities nevertheless enacted strong prohibitions against the practice. Obviously, however "universal" these may have been among Ashkenazic Jewry, they were not accepted in Spain. See generally Guido Kisch, "Relations Between Jewish and Christian Courts in the</page><page sequence="17">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 205 Toledo (and in Spain generally) violated this law frequently. There are several responsa discussing this. A question from Toledo, for instance, was addressed to Ibn Megash concerning a document where a widow left all her property to her daughter, including all debts due her "whether in Jewish documents or in documents of the Muslims.""37 We learn from our docu- ments that Jews were often careful to have important bills of sale, etc., copied twice, once in a Mozarabic court and again in a Jewish court.38 Not all rabbis were averse to accepting the testimony of gentile courts and docu- ments. The renowned rabbi Isaac al-Fasi was asked about a case in which a Jew had given his field to a Muslim as surety for a loan on condition that it would become the property of the Muslim if the loan was not repaid by a certain date. The Muslim sold the field to another Jew, and after eleven years "the Christians took the city," at which time the original owner claimed that he had paid the debt and the field should revert to him. al-Fasi's reply is that if there is a document attested in a Muslim court to support the rightful ownership of the Muslim (at the time he sold the field), it belongs to the person who bought it; if not, it reverts to the original Jewish owner.39 This may refer to the conquest of Toledo in 1085; al-Fdasi arrived in Spain in 1088. Jewish Officials and Courtiers Not the least of the important information which can be gained from a proper analysis of the Mozarabic documents is a considerable amount of new information on Jewish courtiers and community officials, some of whom are previously known from other sources and some of whom are mentioned only here. Perhaps of most significance is Joseph ha-nasi (Hebrew honorific, Middle Ages," Louis Ginzberg Jubilee Volume (New York, 1945), 1:201-225 (with references to other important literature), and note his criticism of David Shohet, Jewish Courts in the Middle Ages (now reprinted as vol. 3 of Studies in Jewish Jurisprudence [New York, 1974]), in his Jews in Medieval Germany (Chicago, 1949), p. 442, n. 4.

He was a counselor and physician of Alfonso VI, in spite of the prohibition of Gregory VII against using Jewish officials of any kind, which was directed specifically to that king by the pope, and in spite of Alfonso's own decree to that effect more than once in 1090.40 According to Rodrigo Jim6nez de Rada (d. 1247), not only archbishop of Toledo but also a major medieval Spanish chronicler, Ibn FerruSiel got in trouble with the king for urging, at the insistence of the nobility, that the widowed daughter of the king, Urraca, marry Count G6mez of Candespina. The Jew, although trusted by the king for his "industry and knowledge of medicine," had presumed too much, and was angrily dismissed by the king and told not to reappear in his presence.41 Joseph was uncle of Solomon Ibn FerruSiel, also active in the king's service, in whose honor the famous poet Judah ha-Levy wrote one of his most beautiful poems, the magnificent "Ba'alat Keshafim" ("Enchanted sorceress"). After the opening love section, the poet has these lines concern- ing Solomon: The minister whom the government has come upon his shoulder; lo, the earth he causes to serve according to his desire. He journeyed-and the face of the city grew dark after him, as it shines before him, upon his return, on all sides.42 40.

The poet then composed a eulogy on the death of the Jewish leader. Meanwhile, his uncle Joseph had let Toledo altogether and gone to Guadalajara.43 He left behind him considerable property in and near the city, which after his death was given to the church by Alfonso VII in 1145.44 Judah ha-Levy also wrote a poem in honor of Joseph Ibn Ferrugiel, in the style known as muwashshab. (strophic poem in which the last couplet is in Arabic or Romance, or sometimes a combination of both). Because of the importance of this poem, and since it is short, I give it here for the first time in an accurate translation: The heads of the people, when they gather, and kings in their assembly, All give thanks to Joseph, for he is the eye of their glory. Eager to rule by God's power, and so he is a ruler over men- The desire of man, of whom everyone says: "the only one, the choice one." Government is prepared for the prince; it is a diadem for beauty.

Perhaps this was acquired by the community after the massacre, in order to protect themselves. The line "streams of oil have overflown the stream of stones" is an allusion to Guadalajara (the Arabic name Wddf-l--ijdra means "stream of stones"), and the "stream of oil" is a further allusion to the tidings of blessing with the coming of Joseph to the city.

Gonzalez gives two lists of the names of these officials, one of Christians and one of Jews, who served from 1115 to 1293.50 It is interesting to note that there is no correspondence between these lists; that is, in the years when a Jew is named as holding the office, no Christian is named, and vice versa. Following are the Jews who held the office (giving the correct spelling from the Arabic documents), the year of office, and volume and document: Abdi Zakariya Yabya Ibn Negro"5 (1158) (2:59) M.

Stern, of course, had not yet had access to Cantera's article when he published his original French article, but in his "Rationalists and Kabbalists in Medieval Allegory," Journal of Jewish Studies 6 (1955): 73, he appears to have accepted Cantera's reading, though without acknowledgment. (Some cor- rections need to be made to his remarks there: first, Ibn FerruSiel was not a "rabbi"; secondly, the king was Alfonso VI, not VII; and thirdly, Ibn FerruSiel did not "visit" Guadalajara, but fled there to escape the wrath of the king.) 47.

Moses Hadas (New York, 1932; 1960). There is also a Jewish bricklayer, Isaac b. El'azar al-Bana Ibn Zabara in the thirteenth century (Mozdrabes, 4, nos. 1142, 1144). 53. Labla is Arabic for Niebla, a town in Spain.</page><page sequence="23">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 211 Another sort of court official, or lower judge, was the wazrr al-qddf. These seem to have held appointments for short periods, two to three years on the average. The names of two Jews appear with this title: Abfi Harfn Mfisa Ibn al-Shakhath (or possibly Shakha$; in any event, hardly "Axxahats," as the Spanish version has it), and Abu 'Umar b. Abu'l-H;Iasan Ashir (Asher?) al-Barjilini. However, the actual documents concerning these use only the title al-wazfr, and there is no way to prove from this, as Gonzalez surmised, that they were judges. So also he erroneously referred to Abfi Ishaq b. Abfi Ibrahim Istalja (Estalecha?) as "alcade y alhaquim," when, in fact, the document says al-wazfr al-bakfm. which is another office entirely.54 Finally, there is al-wazfr Sdhib al-shurta. This is a problematic and important title, usually explained by modern historians as "chief of police.""55 However, this is inadequate and even erroneous, for the title originally was that of a magistrate especially responsible for morality. It passed into Christian terminology in Spain as zavasorda, which often was simply a civiljudge. Apparently, the title even became honorary, for we find several Jews referred to by this title, most notably the renowned scientist and philosopher Abraham b. Hayya (so, not Hiyya), who lived in Barcelona, and also the poet Moses Ibn Ezra, who lived in Granada.56 There is one Jew in the Mozarabic documents with this title, Abfi Harfin Ibn al-I.HariS.57 54.

It is no surprise, therefore, that many famous and important Jews lived there. We have already mentioned Abraham Ibn Daud, Judah ha-Levy, and Judah al- Harizi. Details on the lives of these well-known figures are readily available. However, the Mozarabic documents are rich in details on other notable figures and prominent families, and this also has not been noticed previous- ly by those who have written on the Jews of Spain. In the list of the Jews who held the office of wazir al-mushrif, we find the name (that is, when we consult the actual text of the Arabic document, which has not hitherto been done) of Abu'l-IHasan Yahufid Ibn Ezra (the date 1185 there refers, in fact, to the date of the document in which he is mentioned, and not to the date of his office; this is important, as we shall see). Gonzalez also cited the partition of Azafia (near Illescas, north of Toledo) in 1185, in which Alfonso VIII gave to the cathedral of Toledo "the farms of Fazania [Azaii] which the almoxarife "Avenazara, called Bonvida, possessed."'" There is no doubt that this "Avenazara" is the same as Abu'l-Hasan Yahiddi, whose family name Gonzales misread as "ben Odra." In fact, the Arabic is Ibn 'Idra, which I believe is merely an attempt to render in Arabic script the Hebrew name Ezra.59 This can be none other than Judah Ibn Ezra, son of Joseph (who was one of the brothers of the poet Moses Ibn Ezra).60 Judah was appointed almoxarife of Calatrava by Alfonso VIII in 1147, as Ibn Daud relates: 58. Mozarabes, 1: 90-91, n. 1 (hereditatem de Fazania quondam almoxarifo Avenzara dicto Bonvida nomine possessam). "Bonvida," of course, is merely the equivalent of Abu'l-Hasan, or Judah. 59. Cf. Idris for biblical Ezra, and also the name of a mythical hero in Islam, probably derived from Greek Esdras. See especially Charles Cutler Torrey, The Jewish Foundation of Islam (New York, 1933), p. 72 (I do not understand why this perfectly correct explanation was ignored in the article "Idris" in Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, in favor of older theories which Torrey disproved). 60. See Baer, Jews in Christian Spain, 1:60 ff. on this family; there is no doubt, of course, that this is the same Judah Ibn Ezra who desired to join Judah ha-Levy on his last journey to Palestine (cf. S. D. Goitein, "Ha-Parshah ha-Abaronah be-Hayyei Rabbenu [sic] Yehudah ha-Levy," Tarbiz 24 [1954]: 32 and 35. Goitein was apparently unaware that this Judah was the same as the one mentioned by Ibn Daud, although this was already pointed out by Baer, "Ha-Masav ha-Politiy shel Yehudei Sefarad be-Doro shel R. Yehudah ha-Levy," Zion 1</page><page sequence="25">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 213 King Alfonso the Emperador [Ar. 'imbiralar] appointed our master and rabbi, R. Judah the Nasi b. Ezra over Calatrava [and placed] all royal provisions in his charge. . . . he supervised the passage of the [Jewish] refugees [fleeing from the Almohads] ... At his home and at his very table, where the refugees found rest, he fed the hungry, provided drink for the thirsty, and clothed the naked. Then, providing animals for all the feeble, he had them brought as far as Toledo in great dig- nity. [This he was able to do] by virtue of the awe and respect which he commanded among the Christians, who conveyed them [the refugees]. Although but a youth, he had already been exalted above the people, and lorded it over a company of spearmen. Since he had no regard for silver, nor did he delight in gold, he did not keep for himself any of his share of the King's pay.... Nevertheless, he conducted a huge business.... The King sent for him and appointed him lord of all his household and ruler over all his posses- sions . .61 By "lording it over a company of spearmen" (a somewhat dubious trans- lation at best),62 the editor suggests that Ibn Daud referred to Ibn Ezra's influence with the Order of Calatrava.63 He is probably right about this, but the allusion is to be found instead in the phrase "the respect he commanded among the Christians," not in any supposed statement about "lording it over a company of spearmen," which is simply an erroneous translation (the correct translation ought to be "he inspired fear [or awe]").64 (1938): 18. None of the authors here mentioned, nor anyone else, has realized that the long- available Mozarabic documents contain this important information on Judah Ibn Ezra. 61. Sefer ha-Qabbalah, The Book of Tradition, pp. 97-98 (trans.). 62. See Cohen's note there to lines 109-110 for his justification of this translation. However, all that Abraham Ibn Ezra (no relation to Judah or Moses) says in his commentary to Psalm 68:31 (cited by Cohen there) is that qand in Arabic means "spear"; but the word "spear" is not even mentioned in Ibn Daud's text, and at best is only hinted at. 63. Ibid., p. 98, note to lines 109-110. 64. See also Cohen's analysis of Ibn Daud's motives in thus praising Judah, pp. 274-275 and p. 294 (yet it is not true that Ibn Daud claimed "Davidic lineage" for Ibn Ezra, as asserted on p. 275; cf. Cohen's own observation to the contrary on p. 145, n. 99-100). Le6n Tello incor- rectly states that Ibn Daud reported that Alfonso gave "all the royal part of Calatrava" to Ibn Ezra (Los judios de Toledo, 1:32; she was probably misled by Americo Castro, Espahia en su historia [Buenos Aires, 1948], p. 195, who also believed that Judah was made governor of Calatrava). The Hebrew phrase, in Ibn Daud, 'al kol manat ha-melekh could indeed have this meaning (I have not consulted the Spanish translation of Ibn Daud, which Le6n may have used), but it is probably more correctly translated as Cohen has: "to place all the royal provi- sion in his charge." It is hardly likely that he would have been made governor of the region, but he may well have been in charge of provisions for the troops.</page><page sequence="26">214 NORMAN ROTH The situation must have been desperate indeed during those years, not only in Calatrava itself, but also in Toledo. Alfonso VII remarked in 1147: "How many evils and how many persecutions the city of Toledo has con- stantly suffered-and the whole Christian people-during the time when Calatrava was in the power of the Muslims, is known to all who live in Spain." Following the death of Alfonso VI (1109) until 1118, the Muslims attacked Toledo almost annually; and again in 1128, 1139, and 1143. The attacks resumed in 1172, 1182, 1185, 1196, and 1197.65 Whatever the truth about Judah Ibn Ezra's service to the crown, it must have been substantial, for Sancho III expressed his gratitude and recogni- tion of the service which Judah had always given to Sancho and to his father, Alfonso VII, by granting to him and his children in perpetuity five yugadas of land in the region of Azafia.66 Remarkably, we now find the document of the sale of exactly this land by Judah's daughters in 1185 to the cathedral of Toledo. Their names were Jamila, Sitt Bona, Amira, and Hadassah (only the last is Hebrew, the rest are Arabic). Strangely, Le6n Tello cites another document whereby some land owned by "Judi el almoxerif" in Azafia was given away by the arch- bishop of Toledo (who would have been Juan de Gonzales Torres de Navarra) in 1164. This cannot have been the same property, of course, but does indicate that Judah was perhaps already dead in 1164.67 65.

None of these references was known to Cohen, Sefer ha-Qabbalah. "Boniuda" in the document is, of course, Judah. Yugada means a section of land which can be plowed by a yoke of oxen in a day; about 33 hectares. 67. Mozdrabes, 2, no. 175. Judah is described as a "youth" in 1147 by Ibn Daud, but he must have been at least thirty (his father died in 1128, and judging from Moses Ibn Ezra's poem to him-see below-he must have been at least thirteen at that time). The 1164 document was cited by Le6n Tello, Losjudios, 2, no. 23, and edited there, 1:372-373, no. 2, but she appears unaware that this "Judi el almoxerif" was none other than Judah Ibn Ezra, and the same as referred to in the previous document, mentioned in n. 66 above, of which she was also unaware. There exists also a confirmation of the ownership of the property in Alzafia by the cathedral,</page><page sequence="27">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 215 Knowing the great love which Moses Ibn Ezra had for his brothers, all of whom died before him, and especially for Joseph, it seemed to me possi- ble that the poet might have mentioned his nephew Judah, the son of Joseph. This, indeed, proved to be the case. We find that he wrote a long and very moving poem to Judah, instructing him to give himself to the attain- ment of wisdom and to study. It seems likely that the occasion for this poem was, in fact, the death of his father Joseph in 1128. In it, he says: Judah, seek the eminence of parents and uncles, although they have gone down to Sheol; They are vanished, but their memory is like the sun whose praise is never lacking. He advises him: "Little sleep, my son, little slumber / little laziness, little drinking and eating" (line 15), and concludes the poem with prophetic words that were, indeed, to be fulfilled: Yet you shall have the law of inheritance as your portion, and of redemption; Judah, yet shall your name go forth in the earth and your fame be proclaimed on every road. (lines 49-50)68 The poems of Ibn Ezra provide other names which are worthy of our attention: e.g., the hakim Abu'l-Hasan Meir Ibn Al'azar, to whom the poet addressed a reply to a letter which the latter sent him. Very likely he was the signed by Alfonso VIII, but with no mention that it was sold to the cathedral by the daughters of Judah (ed. Fita, "Templarios, Calatravos y Hebreos," pp. 366-367; Gonzalez, Alfonso VIII, 2:757-758, no. 440; this is cited by Leon Tello, Judios, 2, no. 36. Gonzalez, Alfonso VIII, 1:134-135, discusses Judah briefly, but the information that he was in office in Granada is without foundation (taken from Manuel Vallecillo Avila, "Los judios de Castilla en la alta Edad Media," Cuadernos de historia de Espada 14 [1950]: 17-110, which Gonzalez cites frequently merely as "Vallecillo," but omits in his bibliography. This article, while sometimes correct, contains a great deal of faulty information which has misled many scholars). Also, Gonzilez's statement (1:249) that Judah was also almoxarife of Sancho III is without any foundation; true, Sancho refers to the service which Judah performed for his father and for himself, but this is too general to allow the conclusion that he held the office of almoxarife also under Sancho. 68. Moses Ibn Ezra, Shirei ha-Hfol, ed. H. Brody (Berlin, 1935), 1, no. 105 (my translation).

Indeed, it is probable that this Meir is the same as the "alfacum nomine Abenlahacer" in a document of Alfonso VIII, in which the king conceded to a loyal military official some houses and considerable property (cum terris, uineis, aldeis, molendinis, piscariis, hortis, pratis et paschuis, etc.) which belonged to the Jew.69 As a result of the unusual amount of documentation which we possess concerning the Jews of Toledo, it is possible to learn a great deal about the community and about its influential Jewish families. One of these was the al-Barjilini family. As the Arabic name indicates, the family originated in Barcelona. The earliest record we have of them in Toledo is 1201-1205, when we find the name of Abfi Yfisuf al-Barjilfini (Mozdrabes, 2:303, 312, 340). We hear no further mention of the family until 1238, when we find a judge (wazir al-hakFm) Ya'qub, whose daughter Dona is mentioned, and Isbaq b. 'Azir al-Barjilfini. Abu'l-Ijasan Benjamin b. Abfi Ishaq is mentioned in 1239, 1244, and 1246. One of these documents (1244) is of great interest, for he acted then as representative of the arch- bishop, Rodrigo Jim6nez de Rada, for the purchase of some property. His son, Abraham, is mentioned in 1269 and 1273, as is also the judge Abf 'Umar (Joseph?) b. Abf Ishaq, who may be another son, and Abi 'Umar b. Abu'l-Hasan Benjamin, who is certainly the brother of Abraham. There is also al-wazFr Abi 'Umar b. Abu'l-Hasan Asher in 1242, and Abu'l- Hasan Asher b. Abfi Isbaq b. Abu'l-Hasan Asher in 1273. Other members of the family are al-wazFr al-baktm Ya'qfib (1238), Solomon (1254), Ya'qfib b. Asher (1260), and Abi Yfisuf Ya'qfib (1255).70 It is difficult to imagine that a family of such importance (all of whom owned extensive property, and several of whom were officials) could have 69. Gonzalez, Alfonso VIII, 2, no. 93; Baer, Die Juden, 2, no. 35 (a faulty transcription). Baer also recognized that this Abenlahacer was a Jew, but made no further effort to identify him, yet it is obvious that this is another form of the name Ibn Al'azar, and the date of the document (1166), by which time he was deceased, coincides quite well with this official who lived at the time of Moses Ibn Ezra. It is apparent that this family survived to the late four- teenth century, for Le6n Tello cites a document in which the name of "Samuel Abelhazar" appears (perhaps, indeed, an error in transcription, for in the index she gives the name as "Abenlahazar") (Los judios, 2, no. 5). 70. Mozdrabes, 3:530; 4:841; 3:564, 573; 4:913, 960; 3:639, 716, 554, 555, 639; 4:1082, 1143, 1083, 793 (B). Some of these are also cited by Le6n Tello, but by no means all. The document in which Benjamin is an agent for Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada is 3:564, also cited by Leon Tello, Judios, 2, no. 137 (though without making it clear that this is, in fact, de Rada).</page><page sequence="29">THE JEWS OF MOZARABIC TOLEDO 217 sprung up in Toledo all of a sudden in 1200 with no prior background in the city. It is possible, although the suggestion must be made with extreme caution, that this is the same family as that of the eminent scholar who has been so often confused with the student of Maimonides (for whom the Guide was written), Joseph b. Judah Ibn 'Aqnin. Because he refers to himself as "al-Barjiltini" in some of his works, it has been assumed that he lived in Barcelona. This assumption is, I believe, without warrant. Everything in his style of writing, and the fact that he wrote eloquent Arabic, indicates that he lived instead in Muslim Spain. In one place he gives his full family genea- logy: Joseph b. Judah b. Joseph b. Jacob ha-dayyan (judge) al-Barjilini (Bar;elony in Hebrew). While these names are, of course, very common, it is interesting to note how they are repeated in the al-Barjilfni family of Toledo.7' Abraham Ibn Daud We have often referred to the important chronicle of Abraham Ibn Daud. There is a persistent report in Jewish sources that he died a martyr's death in Toledo. The earliest, and in truth the only reliable, source is a letter written by Joseph b. Todros Abulafia (early thirteenth century) in which he briefly states that Ibn Daud "was killed for the unity of God." No date is given.72 A late-fourteenth-century chronicler, who also lived in Toledo, Isaac Israeli, wrote: "He sanctified [God's] name in public and died for its unity and was buried in Toledo." He also does not hint at a date. Somewhat later, Joseph Ibn $addik of Arevalo, who usually relied on Israeli for his information, states: "Abraham ha-Levy b. David [sic], who sanctified himself on the unity of the Name in Toledo .. . [died] in 1180." This is the first mention of a date. In the late fifteenth century, Abraham Zakut wrote: 71. The confusion of Ibn 'Aqnin, a contemporary of Maimonides, with Joseph Ibn Shimon of Ceuta, his disciple, has plagued scholars for a century or more, for reasons which are hard to understand. One of the sources of this confusion was the edition of Ibn 'Aqnin's important commentary on Pirkei Avot, entitled Sefer Musar, ed. W. Z. Bacher (Berlin, 1910; photo rpt., Jerusalem, 1967), which the editor erroneously attributed to Joseph b. Judah (Ibn Shimon) of Ceuta (see there, p. viii, n. 3, for the author's genealogy). This important work also seems to show signs of its origin in Muslim, not Christian, Spain, and even precisely in Toledo (I shall deal elsewhere with this). 72. Letter, ed. S. Z. H. Halberstamm in Jeschurun 8 (1872-75); 41; rpt. as Qevusat Miktavim (Bamberg, 1875). p. 25.</page><page sequence="30">218 NORMAN ROTH "R. Abraham ha-Levy Ibn Daudi [sic], who sanctified the Name himself, died for the unity of the Name in Toledo ... in the year 1180." It is obvious that he drew from Ibn Saddik as his source. Finally, Solomon Ibn Verga, one of the generation of the exile from Spain, states: "And this R. Abraham ha-Levy was hung [!] for the sanctification of the Name; for the king of Spain wanted to compel him to convert, and since he was unable to, he ordered that he be hung."" Cohen has accepted this least reliable, and latest, account as being correct, and assumed that Ibn Daud's "messianic message" (in his Sefer ha-Qabbalah) was "discovered" by the Christians, and he was "given an opportunity to clear himself" by renouncing his faith in the Jewish Messiah.74 This is, to say the least, highly unlikely. In the first place, the book was written in Hebrew, a language which no Christian (at least in Spain) could yet understand. Secondly, the "messianic message," which is probably there but fairly well concealed, is simply the traditional pious attempt to console despairing Jews undergoing the tribulations of exile. There is nothing blasphemous in this, nor is there anything in the book that could be con- strued as an attack on Christian beliefs (as was the case in the writings of many other Spanish Jews who were not forced, or urged, to convert). Most medieval Jews held a belief in the "Jewish Messiah," but this was merely a belief that God would send the promised Messiah in due time. I am unaware of a single Jew anywhere who was ever persecuted, much less killed, for this "belief." Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that Alfonso VIII, who was king of Castile at the time, would have "hung" a Jew for any religious belief. Indeed, Ibn Daud praises him excessively in his chronicle as a "righteous king," in very nearly messianic terms. Not only that, Alfonso was not even in Toledo in 1180 (when Ibn David was supposedly killed), and did not return to the city until 1181. We may conclude, therefore, that if the accounts have any factual basis at all, Ibn Daud may have been killed by some overzealous Christian fanatics living in Toledo (in addition to Spanish Christians, who rarely persecuted Jews, there were French and other for- 73.

On the other hand, it happens that the tombstone of a probable relative, Moses b. Joseph Ibn Daud of Toledo, has been preserved. He is referred to both as a wealthy man and a government minister to whom the "Arab kings" (Muslim rulers) gave both honor and political authority (misrah). Unfortunately, part of a critical line is missing, but what remains gives us: "he came to Spain [Sefarad, Christian Spain); then the benei surah made themselves despicable [?] because of him" and killed him, in 1240 (? or earlier)." The expression benei surah is very peculiar. I believe the meaning is to be found in the very unusual appearance of the word in Isaiah 49:21, where it means something like "wanderer," or one who turns to and fro, but the translation of the Aramaic Targum there is u-me-lallelah, which is the very word, we recall, which the Jews used for the name of Toledo. Thus, the inscription may be hinting at the fact that the "children [inhabitants] of Toledo" killed this Ibn Daud. In any event, it is clearly stated that he was killed, and in Toledo, rather close to the period when Abraham Ibn Daud is said (by late sources) to have been killed. Is this mere coincidence, or is it possible that the later Jewish sources have confused the two Ibn Dauds, and evolved a myth of the typical martyr's death of which such chroniclers were so fond? In any case, Ibn Verga's account of the supposed martyrdom likely tells us more about conditions in his own day than in that of Ibn Daud. Conclusions The Jews were loyal and valued inhabitants of Toledo from an early period. Following the Christian reconquest of the city from the Muslims in 1085, there were repeated attempts by the Muslims to win the city back. Jews often proved loyal defenders of the city against these attacks, and except for the one incident of a massacre (which may, indeed, have been provoked by foreign troops), we hear of no conflict between Christians and Jews throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. On the basis of an examination, the first ever undertaken, of all the sources-Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, and Spanish-for the Jews of Mozarabic Toledo, we have seen that this was a thriving community with extensive 75.

Most importantly, perhaps, the various documents provide us with rare and detailed insight into daily relations between Jews and Christians, and confirm in a precise way the impression, gained also from other sources for medieval Spain, that they lived together in harmony and cooperation. This extended to the Church and its various institutions and to the highest- ranking Church officials in the realm (the information which we have uncovered here for the first time concerning relations between such major figures of medieval Spain as Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada and Archdeacon Maurice, later archbishop of Burgos, and the Jews ought not to be ignored in future work on these men). Finally, the analysis of the Arabic documents, and a comparison with Hebrew source material, has resulted in important new information about major Jewish officials and families in Toledo, and has shed new light on such prominent figures as Joseph Ibn 'Aqnin and Abraham Ibn Daud. (The same documents reveal the presence of two sons of Nal.manides in Toledo in the latter part of the fourteenth century, but that is beyond the scope of this study.) Sources properly approached, with the necessary linguistic tools and comparative analysis, can help to open up a world of Jewish life which played a major part in the Jewish civilization of medieval Spain.
