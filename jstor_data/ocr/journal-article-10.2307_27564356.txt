The literary approach was an overt attempt to overcome the fractures that historical criticism had introduced into the surface of the biblical text. It proposed instead to read the text?with all of its surface irregularities, gaps, and hiatuses?as coherent and meaningful. In rabbinic literature, the purposes to which literary studies have been put are somewhat different. The collectively authored compilations of midrash, mishnah, and gemara present different challenges to readers. Most notably, the various genres of rabbinic literature lack a clear narrative structure. They often read like a stream of consciousness, associatively interweaving legal maxims, exegesis, and argumentation. Trying to pin down the meaning of a rabbinic text is a like trying to herd kittens into a bag. When you finally manage to pin down two or three, another two or three are sneaking out. When reading rabbinic litera ture, it is not uncommon to detect the first inklings of a literary pattern, only to find it undermined when new material is associatively introduced and a new tangent begins. Given the unruly, uncontainable quality of rabbinic literature, literary approaches have been used to stabilize contexts for interpretation. That is, literary approaches have been used to capture some, if not all, of the cats in a given unit of discourse. Literary approaches have been adapted to the reading of rabbinic literature in a variety of different ways to highlight different features of the texts. Some scholars, such as Daniel Boyar?n and James Kugel, have focused on reconstruct ing the "reading process" that produces rabbinic interpretations of the Bible. By attending to various factors that give rise to midrashic reading, they reconstruct 1. Leading scholars in the new approach to biblical studies include Meir Sternberg, Robert Alter, and Adele Berlin. The full range of their scholarship exemplifies the literary approach, but see especially their pioneering works: Meir Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985); Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (New York: Basic, 1981); and Adele Berlin, Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative (Sheffield: Almond Press, 1983). 225</page><page sequence="2">Elizabeth Shanks Alexander the interpretive activity implicit within the text's final presentation. Boyar?n shows how midrashic readings emerge from recontextualizing discrete scriptural fragments that resonate with each other, even though they are from different parts of the biblical canon.2 Kugel shows how midrashic readings flow from rabbinic attention to idiosyncratic details in atomized words and phrases of scripture.3 Other scholars, such as Yonah Fraenkel and David Stern, have identified subunits within the stream of rabbinic discourse (sage stories and parables) that do have literary integrity in and of themselves. Fraenkel and Stern have proposed methods of interpretation that are uniquely suited to these units of discourse.4 Building on their project, Ofra Meir and Jeffrey Rubenstein have argued that smaller subunits of discourse also need to be considered within their broader legal and literary contexts. According to Meir and Rubenstein, literary meaning is a function not just of the arrangement of individual elements within a subunit but also of how the subunit is situated in a larger context.5 Yet other scholars, such as Steven Fraade and Aryeh Cohen, have engaged large units of the complete redacted text in all of its apparent chaos. With Fraade working in midrash halakhah and Cohen working with legal argumentation in the Bavli, both scholars have tried to discern subtle signs of order and narrativity within the flow of arguments, counterarguments, interpretation, and apparent tangents.6 Recent literary studies of the Mishnah variously adopt all of the models described here. The work of Avraham Walflsh proceeds on the model of the last task: discerning subtle signs of order within the flow of arguments, counterargu ments, interpretation, and tangents. His recent dissertation, entitled "The Literary Method of Redaction in the Mishnah Based on Tractate Ro'sh Hashanah," is the primary focus of this essay.7 While acknowledging all of the incongruities in 2.

In a dissertation subtitled "Narrative and Legal Discourse in the Mishnah,"9 Moshe Simon-Shoshan appears to be working on the model of Rubenstein and Meir. He examines the stories of the Mishnah, but insofar as he suggests that their meaning is inflected by the broader legal discourse in which they are situated, he attends to redactional context as a criterion for interpretation. Simon Shoshan disagrees with previous characterizations of mishnaic stories as aggadic because?he suggests?this interpretation ignores the larger legal context in which they are set. He argues instead that the Mishnah's legal dictums and stories present a unified field of discourse, all of which displays differing degrees of narrativity, but all of which are essentially intended to convey legal norms. Though he is focused on the sub-unit of the mishnaic story, he is also highly attentive to the broader legal context in which these stories are set. My own book, Transmitting Mishnah, draws inspiration from the work of Boyar?n and Kugel. Just as they try to reconstruct the intellectual activity reflected by the formally redacted texts of midrashic commentary, I try to imagine the analytic processes that lie behind the Mishnah's presentation of legal dictums.10 A second way in which my work builds on their accomplishments lies in my focus on how the Mishnah was read by later talmudic sages. Their work highlights the explicitly hermeneutical character of midrash. I, too, try to reconstruct the interpretive lens informing the talmudic reading of the Mishnah.11 Having a clear sense of the hermeneutical habits informing talmudic interpretation helps establish clear boundaries between how mishnaic discourse functioned in the setting in which it was first promulgated and how the text was understood by later readers. Avraham Walfish's Contribution The work of Walfish, then, is part of a growing trend to incorporate literary methods into the interpretation of rabbinic texts generally, and into the study of the 8. The work of Natan Margalit focuses on discerning literary patterns within chapters of the Mishnah.

In Walfish's case, he uses literary methods to help us see mishnaic chapters and tractates as coherent compositions. One of the dissertation's most important contributions is the identification of patterns that lend coherence to mishnaic compositions. Walfish notes the various ways in which sounds, words, and themes are repeated and arranged. One such pattern is what he calls the "envelope structure" {hatimah m'ain petihah)}2 This occurs when words, themes, or sounds from the beginning of a literary unit are repeated, though with some alteration, at the end of the unit. These repetitions both help to define the boundaries of literary units for interpretation and also point to the themes that dominate the unit. An interesting example can be found in Chapter 3 of M. Ro'sh Hashanah. Whereas the first mishnah of the chapter says, "The courts and all Israel saw it [the moon]," the final mishnah speaks of "a time when Israel looked upwards and submitted their hearts to their Father in heaven." The chapter both begins and ends with the trope of Israel directing its eyes heavenward, where moon and Father can be found.13 Walfish further notes that while the outer envelope of Chapter 3 gives prominence of place to seeing, most of the chapter is taken up with the shofar, which is engaged through hearing. Walfish suggests that this visu ally oriented envelope structure frames the inner material about shofar. He argues that the Mishnah understands the shofar to be a vehicle for directing Israel's cries upward.14 Another literary phenomenon that Walfish identifies is known as enchain ment (shirshur?the technical rhetorical term is "anadiplosis").15 Examples of enchainment are found where contiguous mishnayot have a phrase or word in common. In this way, each mishnah is linked to the next one. Walfish shows how Chapter 2 of M. Ro'sh Hashanah is unified through the phenomenon of enchainment.16 The majority of the chapter discusses the procedures for examin ing the witnesses and declaring the new moon. Mishnahs 2-4 incongruously treat the bonfires used for notifying the nation of the new moon. Topically, these mishnayot are out of place. Walfish demonstrates, however, that the technique of enchainment is used to integrate the "foreign" elements into the chapter. Furthermore, Walfish identifies a Leitwort (milah manhah) that runs throughout the chapter: seeing}1 The chapter presents the process of declaring the new month as a series of "seeings": first by the nation at large (the witnesses see the moon in M. Ro'sh Hashanah 2:6 and 2:7); second within the rabbinic court (the examination of the witnesses requires them to look at diagrams of the moon in M. Ro'sh Hashanah 2:6 and 2:8, and R. Joshua says to his rabbinic colleague, 12. See Richard A Lanham, A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms, 2nd ed. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 10.

Ro'sh Hashanah 2:8); and finally back in the nation (where the outlying areas see the bonfires letting them know of the high court's declaration M. Ro'sh Hashanah 2:3 and 2:4). Walfish suggests that by focusing on various acts of seeing by different parties the mishnaic chapter stresses the reciprocity between the court and the nation. On one hand, the court has the authority to determine the new moon, and it disseminates its decision to the nation. On the other hand, the court is depen dent on the nation to supply witnesses. It goes to elaborate lengths to encourage witnesses from within the nation at large to come to court to testify. Whereas parallel materials in the Sifra focus on the fact that humans (over and against God) have the authority to determine the new month, the Mishnah stresses the complex dynamic between the court and nation within the human sphere.18 For Walfish, literary phenomena such as enchainment, wordplay, envelope struc tures, and leading words offer precious clues for reading chapters and tractates of the Mishnah as coherent compositions that communicate specific cultural messages. Another important component of Walfish's work is his clear attribution of the literary phenomena that he identifies to a redactor.19 Walfish claims that the phenomena he identifies are not random, natural recurrences of language, nor are they features that were introduced to ease memorization. Rather, they are the intentional product of an artful redacting hand. To support this argument, Walfish points to the residual traces from which we can reconstruct the editor's literary craft. The term he uses is tevVot 'ezba'otav shel ha'orekh (literally, "fingerprints of the editor"). He explains that the editor left his "fingerprints" on his raw source materials when he passed them on in the form of the edited Mishnah.20 Walfish uses parallels from the Tosefta and halakhic midrashim (often the Sifra) to show what the raw materials available to the mishnaic editor probably looked like. Evaluating the difference between the raw source materials and the mishnaic text reveals what is truly unique and distinctive in the mishnaic rendering of its sources. For example, Chapter 1 of M. Ro'sh Hashanah begins with a literary con struct that positions the four new years and the four seasons of judgment as parallel phenomena (see M. Ro'sh Hashanah 1:1-2). Walfish demonstrates that the literary parallelism between the first two mishnayot is not mere happenstance but the by-product of the redactor's intentional manipulations. Walfish shows that the trope of four seasons of judgment is a creation of the mishnaic editor, intro duced specifically to link the new year to judgment. According to Walfish, the editor had available to him two different sources about seasons of judgment. He points to one tradition that speaks of the three seasons of agricultural judgment at the three festivals.21 A second tradition speaks of Israel being called to judgment 18. Ibid., 99-101. 19. Ibid., 21-23, 367-84. 20. Ibid., 8-9. 21. This tradition is exemplified in T. Sukkah 3:18; Sifrei Bamidbar, Pinhas, pis. 150, to Numbers 29:35 (ed. Horowitz, p. 196); and Y Ro'sh Hashanah 1:3 (57b). 229</page><page sequence="6">Elizabeth Shanks Alexander on Ro'sh Hashanah. Walfish argues that these two lists were combined into a single source about four seasons of judgment.23 Walfish argues that this move was more than just a convenient way of collecting diverse materials into a single transmissional unit. Conflating the lists allowed the redactor to make an important point about the intersection between the four new years and the four seasons of judgment. Only Rosh Hashanah appears on the two lists. Only it is both a new year and a time of judgment.24 This introduction to the tractate sets the scene for the holiday as a time when a powerful cosmic drama will occur. Monitoring the difference between the Mishnah and its tannaitic parallels helps the reader see the distinctive editorial choices made by the Mishnah's redac tor. Walfish builds on the recent work of Judith Hauptman and Shamma Friedman, who reconsider the relationship between the Tosefta and the Mishnah.25 The assumption of early scholarship was that the Mishnah preserved some of the ear liest tannaitic materials, and that toseftan materials should be seen as a later gloss and protocommentary.26 Both Hauptman and Friedman demonstrate that, in many instances, the material preserved in the Tosefta is actually older than that of the Mishnah, and that it was often a source for the Mishnah. Indeed, the dominant trend today is not to take for granted the Mishnah's chronological priority com pared to other tannaitic materials. Friedman calls instances in which the Mishnah's formulations differ in subtle ways from that of the Tosefta "edited parallels."27 In a similar vein, Walfish sees the variants of the Mishnah and its parallels as an index of how the mishnaic editor reworked earlier sources in intentional and purposeful ways. Walfish links these observations to concrete claims about mishnaic redac tion. He argues that these features of the text were not introduced to facilitate memorization (though in some cases they may aid it).28 Rather, these features highlight conceptual themes that the redactor wanted to stress. Questions Provoked by the New Literary Approaches to the Mishnah In reading Walfish's work, I often found myself drawing parallels between his work and that of Rubenstein in Talmudic Stories. As I have noted with respect to Walfish, Rubenstein also discerns the traces of the editor's activity by compar ing the final textual product with its earlier parallels. In Rubenstein's work, the 22. This tradition is exemplified in Sifrei Bamidbar, Nas'o, pis. 57, to Numbers 7:88 (ed. Horowitz, p. 55). 23. Walfish attributes this observation to G. Alon.

Walfish, "The Literary Method of Redaction," 367-84. 230</page><page sequence="7">Recent Literary Approaches to the Mishnah Babylonian versions of talmudic stories are compared with earlier versions (often in the Yerushalmi). Like Walfish, Rubenstein argues that the changes were intro duced intentionally by the editors of the later work (in his case, the Bavli) in a way that displays conceptual coherence.29 Rubenstein, however, goes a step further than Walfish has to date. Once Rubenstein discerns the concerns expressed by the Bavli's redacting hand, he locates the redactors in a particular social and insti tutional setting.30 Based on the themes addressed by the redactor, he paints a picture of the concerns that animate life in that setting. The question arises, do Walfish's conclusions about the proactive redacting hand of the Mishnah allow us to glimpse the social setting within which this hand operated? All indications from historians Lee Levine, Catherine Hezser, and Seth Schwartz are that the social setting lying behind mishnaic redaction was much less institutionalized than that lying behind the Bavli.31 Other recent work on tannaitic culture high lights the challenges the rabbis faced in establishing their authority.32 These other studies offer insights into the anxieties that plagued the nascent rabbinic movement and how it wrestled with them. Two issues arise here for consideration: one more closely related to Walfish's work, and the other opening up more generally to the growing field of mishnaic studies. First, Walfish's work points out how important it is to estab lish clear criteria for distinguishing between the agenda of the mishnaic redactor (reflected in the Mishnah as we have it, as opposed to, say, toseftan or midrashic parallels) and the ethos of the rabbis generally during the tannaitic period. As noted earlier, Walfish uses tannaitic parallels to indicate what is unique and distinctive in the mishnaic stories, as opposed to other tannaitic compositions. Elsewhere in his work, however, Walfish uses tannaitic parallels in a different way. A conceptual interpretation of a given mishnaic unit (be it a mishnah, a series of mishnayot, or a chapter) is confirmed when similar concepts are found in other tannaitic materials.33 Here, it seems, the researcher faces a genuine methodological quandary. Tannaitic parallels are positioned both as a foil to confirm that which is a distinctive to the Mishnah and in a unified context with the Mishnah, to indicate something of the ambient culture in which the Mishnah participates. 29.

Walfish sets forth this method of validating his literary readings in "The Literary Method of Redaction," 9-10. 231</page><page sequence="8">Elizabeth Shanks Alexander The state of mishnaic and tannaitic studies is such that, to date, no single strategy or method of historical text criticism is widely accepted for deciding when to use a parallel to corroborate mishnaic reading and when to use it as a foil against which to see the Mishnah's distinctive concerns more clearly. Having earlier compared Walfish's methods with those of Rubenstein, let us momentarily return to Rubenstein's Talmudic Stories. Rubenstein identifies the unique concerns of the Bavli by isolating textual elements that differ from earlier parallels. Having no parallel texts from the late stammaitic period (contem porary to the latest redactional layer responsible for the transformative editing of the Bavli), all distinctive elements in the Bavli are attributed to the stammaim, the Bavli's artful redactors. As the stammaitic period in Babylonia produced only one great cultural artifact (i.e., the Bavli), Rubenstein uses the evidence of the Bavli's distinctive voice to reconstruct social and cultural dynamics of the stammaitic period. By way of contrast, the sources that Walfish uses to highlight the distinc tive contributions of the mishnaic redactor are roughly contemporaneous with the Mishnah. When Walfish compares the literary choices of the mishnaic redactor with those exhibited by other tannaitic texts, it is not clear a priori whether the Mishnah's choices should be regarded as (1) unique to the Mishnah or (2) charac teristic of the tannaitic period generally. Given the roughly contemporaneous character of the Mishnah and its tannaitic parallels, either approach is equally viable from a theoretical perspective. If one wants to read the material from other tannaitic corpuses to establish both the Mishnah's uniqueness and its commonality with other tannaitic docu ments, we should have a means of deciding when to read one way or when to read the other. In point of fact, I found most of Walfish's readings convincing, but a lack of methodological clarity on this issue suggests a direction for future efforts. One desideratum I would lay forward for mishnaic studies as we move forward, then, is a clearer distinction between the concerns of the rabbis during the tannaitic period more generally and the distinct function served by this specific literary formulation we have in the Mishnah. Literary analysis such as that modeled by Walfish has an important function to serve in achieving this understanding. My second observation about Walfish's dissertation sets his work in the context of other recent work on the Mishnah. Like Walfish, the bulk of the new research regards tannaitic material, and the Mishnah specifically, as an important cultural phenomenon in its own right. Whereas more traditional scholarship views the Mishnah through the lens of later talmudic interpretation, the new wave of Mishnah work seeks to take the Mishnah and its tannaitic bedfellows out of the shadow of the Bavli. Here we follow an agenda set forth by Jacob Neusner in the seventies.34 In showcasing the Mishnah as a cultural product in its own right, scholars find they must clarify the boundaries between the Mishnah and its earlier precedents, on one hand, and between the Mishnah and its later 34. See initially Jacob Neusner, The Modern Study of the Mishnah (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973), and then later, Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981). 232</page><page sequence="9">Recent Literary Approaches to the Mishnah interpreters, on the other. In the first case, scholars are examining the relationship between the Mishnah and its legal antecedents in the Second Temple period. Here, the increasing trend is to observe that the mishnaic representation of Second Temple institutions is heavily inflected by late tannaitic cultural concerns.35 The mishnaic materials, even when they have strong affinities with Second Temple traditions, should not be seen as providing a transparent window onto Second Temple practice and law. Rather, scholars are highlighting how mishnaic materials are formulated in dialogue with contemporary tannaitic interests. In the second case, scholars distinguish between the Mishnah as understood in its own setting and the meanings attributed to it by later talmudic readers. My own work articulates the difference between prevailing tannaitic conceptions of mishnaic textuality and those of the later talmudim. To draw on a military meta phor, while some of us are protecting the integrity of the Mishnah from an incur sion from the south (the Second Temple period), others of us are guarding against an incursion from the north (later talmudic sources). In the middle, yet others scho lars are holding down the fort by attuning us to the distinctive features of mishnaic textuality.36 By helping us see the intentionality informing mishnaic redaction, Walfish's work fits into this last category. In my view, Walfish's work in conjunction with other recent work on the Mishnah sets forth an agenda consisting of two basic tasks. On one hand, we should seek to understand the distinctive social, institutional, and theological concerns that plagued the nascent rabbinic movement during the period when mishnaic materials were being produced. In this task, we should use mishnaic materials alongside their tannaitic parallels to recreate the world from which the Mishnah emerged. The second task is to isolate the specific articulation that these concerns achieved in the hands of the mishnaic redactors. Here, Walfish's approach has much to offer and indeed has already contributed much. In my own research, I have downplayed the significance of the Mishnah's particular formulations over and against those of its tannaitic parallels. I imagine the fact that the Mishnah is a more tightly organized compilation than its tannaitic parallels to follow from the fact that mishnaic materials were more extensively studied by subsequent generations of transmitters. At the center of the rabbinic curriculum, the Mishnah's presentation of tradition would have been subject to more opportu nities for fine-tuning and refinement. But I do not think Walfish's emphasis on the influence of a controlling redactional hand and my emphasis on the influence of transmission need necessarily be opposed. If it can be shown that a redacting hand shaped a message that was in dialogue with but uniquely positioned in the 35. See Rosen-Zvi, "Tekes hasotah basifrut hatanna'it," who examines tannaitic representations of a ritual tied to the Temple; Berkowitz, Execution and Invention, who examines tannaitic representations of the death penalty; and Shaye Cohen, "The Judean Legal Tradition and the Halakhah of the Mishnah," in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic Literature, ed. Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert and Martin Jaffee (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 121^43, who examines the areas of overlap between Second Temple and tannaitic laws concerning the Sabbath. 36.1 would put the work of Moshe Simon-Shoshan, Avraham Walfish, and Natan Margalit into this category. 233</page><page sequence="10">Elizabeth Shanks Alexander ambient rabbinic discourse, that would be an enormous contribution. In order to fully appreciate the distinctive character of mishnaic composition, it is important to give detailed attention to the cultural concerns of the tannaitic period more gen erally. New work by Ishay Rosen-Zvi, Beth Berkowitz, and Chaya Halberstam contribute to this desideratum in important and credible ways. In conclusion, what unites various recent works on the Mishnah is their interest in the world of the Mishnah in and of itself. They seek to understand the worldview and abiding human concerns pulsing through the world from which the Mishnah comes. Some are more focused on specific cultural questions debated in specific texts. For example, Rosen-Zvi is concerned with rabbinic atti tudes toward body and ritual after the destruction of the Temple. Berkowitz explores attitudes toward law and authority. Chaya Halberstam investigates rabbinic grapplings with the limits of their knowing. Others are taken up with the clarifying the methods that most fruitfully reveal the Mishnah's cultural testimony. Hauptman promotes a method for reading mishnaic materials that regards them as reworkings of earlier toseftan parallels. Walfish gives us a rich vocabulary for describing literary features of the Mishnah, and he models how attention to these features sheds light on the cultural questions that were at stake in the tannaitic period. Simon-Shoshan proposes methods for reading stories embedded within a broader framework that includes traditions with various degrees of "narrativity." My own work seeks to distinguish mishnaic discourse from the view of Mishnah superimposed on it by later talmudic readers. Future research promises to build on both these characterizations of tannaitic culture and to rely on the reading methods we have collectively proposed.
