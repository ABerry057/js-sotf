Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. xxxi, 323 pp. In this meticulous and intricate study, Moshe Idel of the Hebrew Univer- sity returns to one of the most intriguing facets of Jewish magical and mystical lore: the golem, or artificial anthropoid. Best known in our day via the notorious legend of Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague's rebellious homun- culus, this powerful legend has spawned dozens of contemporary artistic renderings in Western literature, art, and cinema. But the golem has a long history predating R. Judah Loew. The great pioneer-scholar Gershom Scholem took up the golem enigma in an article first published in German in 1953 (revised in 1960; translated into English in 1965 as "The Idea of the Golem," in On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism [New York, 1965], pp. 158-204; amended and translated into Hebrew 1976), which has since become a classic. Prompted by an exhibition on the golem held at the Jewish Museum in 1988, Idel was invited to prepare an essay on the golem. This book-length study is the happy result of the original essay. In returning to the golem, Idel is acutely aware of the contributions made by Scholem, but maintains, first, that many more manuscript sources concerning the golem traditions have been uncovered in the intervening thirty-seven (or thirty) years, and second, that Scholem seriously misinterpreted (or failed to identify) themes and les- sons to be culled from the golem lore.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 Scholem's study stressed a number of points which, until now, have gone undisputed: (1) the Sefer Ye;irah, while not explicitly composed as a recipe for creating entities, was eventually interpreted in the medieval period as a recipe for creating an anthropoid; (2) the methods of golem creation were largely meditative practices for achieving an ecstatic mystical experience in which a vision of the golem was the goal of the meditation; (3) the dangers' of the golem were linked to a long-standing "tellurian" vitality associated with the elemental ingredients for the golem (this is much more prevalent in the final Hebrew version of the article); and (4) there are few astrological motifs in the golem lore. Idel, among other things, challenges each of these four points. But unlike Idel's recent Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, 1988), this new volume is not structured around a sustained critique or revision of Scholem. In fact, the absence from Golem of an overtly contra-Scholemian polemic makes it a much more readable, accessible, and laudable contribu- tion to Jewish knowledge. Critical of Scholem and his disciples though he may be, Idel sets out to methodically review, analyze, and interpret a body of traditions, witnesses, and reports which speak to the golem myth. In pro- viding a lucid and highly nuanced presentation of all the relevant material, Idel makes a strong, oftentimes convincing case for a fresh interpretation of the golem. The book is divided into five parts, divided according to chronological units: (1) Ancient Traditions, (2) Medieval Elaborations, (3) Renaissance Period, (4) Early-Modern and Modern Reverberations, and a fifth part composed of three appendixes. Within these chronological divisions, however, material is oftentimes presented out of historical sequence, and some material is presented along thematic lines across broad expanses of time. Occasionally matters are juxtaposed in a confusing fashion which adumbrates material to be presented in subsequent pages. Thus, for exam- ple, the traditions of the Sefer Yegirah are presented before and contrasted with talmudic traditions yet to be introduced (p. 17); similarly, Abulafian attitudes are contrasted with the Sefer ha-Bahir, though the Bahir material is yet to be discussed (p. 101). First, Idel establishes that the original intent of the Sefer Yezirah was, among other things, to provide a recipe for creating a ye;ur, a man. Rather than serving as a springboard for medieval imagination, the Sefer Ye;irah in situ hints at a process for creating anthropoids, akin to the process for creat- ing a universe. Thus, the medieval golem traditions which became attached</page><page sequence="3">134 BOOK REVIEWS to the Sefer Yegirah are not to be regarded as imaginative hermeneutics, but as legitimate evocations of themes already clearly implicit in the text. Second, Idel delineates between two competing mystical interpretations of the golem lore: one, a German Hasidic-Abulafian interpretation; the other, a Spanish interpretation. The more influential German Hasidic- Abulafian tradition takes a very realistic posture toward golem creation. These Northern traditions are not usually meditative practices designed to induce an interior experience within the golem-cook; they literally are designed to perform an act of creative Jewish magic. Only the Abulafian school views the golem-making process as an interior ecstatic experience. The less prominent Spanish tradition views the golem as a theosophic sym- bol. The more circumscribed Spanish lore is attenuated most likely because of a prevailing Spanish philosophical-scientific skepticism concerning golem construction. Thus, the Spanish schools tend toward either psychological or theosophical interpretations of the golem tradition, attached to the sefirotic structure and the Adam Qadmon. And it is worthwhile to note the complete absence of golem lore in the capping work of Spanish Kabbalah, the Sefer ha-Zohar. Third, Idel discusses in detail the Renaissance traditions amongst Jews and Christians alike. This project in and of itself is a major addition to the material already adduced by Scholem. Here the sage R. Yohanan ben Isaac Alemanno looms above all others. Stressing the Renaissance magical and astrological themes of the golem, Idel conclusively establishes that a long tradition of purely magical and astral associations had become attached to the golem, stemming all the way back to the Sefer Yezirah itself, where, inter alia, the limbs of the anthropos are correlated to constellations. Thus, a per- vasive theme of Idel's Golem is to vindicate the internal continuity of hoary kabbalistic traditions concerning the golem. Fourth, Idel identifies a fairly late augmentation of a "danger" theme to the golem creature. Furthermore, Idel disputes Scholem's etiology of this danger. Scholem had claimed that the elemental stuff out of which the golem was created contained a "tellurian" vitality which could overpower the mystic creator, leading to disaster. Scholem had identified R. Moses Cordo- vero as a source for this "tellurian" understanding; Idel correctly interprets Cordovero's notion of elemental hiyyut ("vitality") as a reflection of divine emanation: "Consequently, the active powers in the material world are not tellurian, i.e., forces that reside uniquely in the elementary world and crys-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 135 tallize with the structuring of matter in a pecuiar way; on the contrary, these powers are reflections of the supernal light that is continuously captured in this lower realm" (p. 197). While most of Idel's reasoning is sound and substantial, this reviewer would like to challenge at least one of his assertions: namely, that a manu- script treatise entitled The Secret of the Name of 42 Letters, rather than being a twelfth- or thirteenth-century text (J. Dan and G. Scholem, respec- tively), is of a later period (pp. 66-69). Idel concludes that the text shows the influence of R. Yehudah he-Hasid and R. Eleazar of Worms, and therefore must be dated to a somewhat later period. Yet nowhere in the text do we find some of the key elements of the German-Hasidic golem recipe, so prev- alent in other golem-traditions derived from the German Hasidim. While the German-Hasidic lore-whether it stems from R. Yehudah he-Hasid, R. Eleazar of Worms, or the Pseudo-Saadyan Commentary on Sefer Yezirah- makes great cause of the proper ingredients for the golem (virgin soil and water), and employs the usual Hebrew verb legabbel ("to knead"), The Secret of the Name of 42 Letters contains none of this. It therefore remains an open question as to whether this text predates or postdates the German- Hasidic material, including the Sefer ha-Gematri'ot. The editorial quality of the text is generally quite good, certainly the best of Idel's volumes in the SUNY series. There are, however, numerous copy- editing slips which crop up throughout the volume. The most serious error on this score is the absence of a note accompanying the text of p. 274, n. 18, and the subsequent misnumbering of notes to that chapter. What Idel's volume accomplishes is compelling: by exhaustively focus- ing on one fairly limited topic, Idel profoundly advances our knowledge of the broad fabric of Jewish magic and mysticism; at the same time, he suc- cessfully makes the case that it will be well worthwhile to return to issues once thought completely covered by Scholem. With brilliant insight, textual and methodological virtuosity, and painstaking care, Idel has provided readers with a superb volume. Idel's Golem now becomes the new "last word" on the mystical anthropoid. Ronald C. Kiener Trinity College Hartford, Conn.</page></plain_text>
