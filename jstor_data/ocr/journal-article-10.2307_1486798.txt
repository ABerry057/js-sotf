<plain_text><page sequence="1">TITHE AS GIFT: THE BIBLICAL INSTITUTION IN LIGHT OF MAUSS'S PRESTATION THEORY by MENAHEM HERMAN This study presents a new interpretation of tithe references in Scripture. It departs from the conventional view that the tithe is merely a tax levied on the people. Rather it sees the tithe as a partnership or compact with God in which tangible goods are exchanged for intangible ones. Taking the Penta- teuch in its entirety as our context reveals the tithe to be part of a pattern of reciprocities in which goods are exchanged for divine acceptance, protec- tion, and blessing. George Buchanan Gray in his prominent work of 1925, Sacrifice in the Old Testament, presents biblical sacrifice as gift. This study expands on Gray's thesis and argues that the tithe itself should properly be viewed as a gift. The interpretation of tithe as gift-rather than tax-is supported by legislative references to the tithe in Scripture which portray it has having sig- 51</page><page sequence="2">52 MENAHEM HERMAN nificant features in common with similar systems found in other cultures.' Anthropologists refer to these as gift-exchange systems. The focus of this study differs from previous interpretations of the tithe, which for the most part were concerned with dating the tithe references and showing how the tithe changed in various historical periods. Nor is it con- cerned with the way the tithe was collected or administered for the mainten- ance of the state. Those issues regarding the tithe have been thoroughly explored, and there is no consensus.2 This is where a holistic approach can make a contribution to the study of legislative tithe references as found in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteron- omy. Looking at the Pentateuch as an entity in itself, scholars have come to regard the scriptural text as it stands as somehow greater than the sum of its parts. This development is the result of the greater role that is now accorded to "literary theories and methods" in biblical studies.3 Meir Weiss argues that "we must return to the text, listen to its voice, see in its own image, and in its totality, before we dare to say another word about it."4 His approach, "total interpretation," accepts the Masoretic text as the "basis of serious cri- tical study of the Bible."5 According to Weiss, "total interpretation" is distinguished by its broad view of the biblical text. For Weiss, the Masoretic text "is the only complete text of the Hebrew Bible, and only through it can sound exegesis, interpret- ing the Hebrew by the Hebrew, be achieved."6 We find Weiss's view of the biblical text useful to our investigation of Priestly and Deuteronomic tithe references in the Pentateuch. Thus Weiss's approach enables one to see how the traditions on the tithe fit together, despite the many differences of form, content, and theological outlook that may characterize the biblical evi- dence.7 1. Biblical ordinances dealing with the tithe include Priestly (Lev. 27:30-33, Num. 18:21-32) and Deuteronomic sources (Deut. 12:6-7, 11-12, 17-18; 14:22-29; 26:12-15). 2.

He, too, finds sufficient reason to treat Scripture as a unity.8 Nevertheless, this trend in biblical scholarship should not be regard- ed as a return to a precritical approach. On the contrary, it is a way of look- ing at the text in its entirety that takes account of textual and literary diffi- culties. John Barton notes that "it is only after we have seen how varied and inconsistent the Old Testament really is that we can begin to ask whether it can nonetheless be read as forming a unity."9 Recent scholarship has treated legislative tithe references in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in terms of separate traditions recognized by modern biblical criticism as the Priestly and the Deuteronomic, hereafter P and D. This study, on the other hand, considers these references as comple- mentary elements in the Pentateuch as it stands, here understood as a single work composed of what are now the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Furthermore, the holistic approach used in this study of the tithe also helps in the attempt to recover the way the Pentateuch was viewed by the postex- ilic Jewish community. They viewed it as the definitive statement on the covenant, which is God's relation with His people.'0 The covenant as 8. Brevard S.

Beginning with the period of the Restoration, emphasis was placed upon living a life consonant with the mitzvot, i.e., the ritual and ethical precepts of the Torah as defined by Judaism. The observance of the tithe became a singular expression of Jewish piety throughout the period of the Second Temple. See M. D. Herr, "Yerushalayim, ha-Mikdash ve-ha-Avodah ba-Meriyut u-be-Toda'ah bi-Yemei Bayit Sheni: Perakim be-Toldot Yerushalayim be-Yemei Bayit Sheni," in Abraham Schalit Memorial Volume, ed.

Other Jewish writings from the second century B.C.E. maintained that tithing was to be taken as an indication of personal piety. See Solomon Zeitlin's introduction to The Book of Judith, trans., commentary, and critical notes by Morton S. Enslin (Leiden: E. J. Brill, for Dropsie University, 1972), pp. 33-34. Urbach cites R. Joshua, who refers to tithing activity in the period preceding the restoration of the Temple (m. 'Ed. 8:6). See E. E. Urbach, Hazal: Pirkei Emunot ve-De'ot (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1971), p. 600, n. 57. Talmudic sources make plain the fact that tith- ing was long regarded as the mark of Jewish piety. See S. Min-Hahar, Ha-Are; u-Mizvotehah (Brooklyn: Haskel Publications, 1969), p. 30. Finally, the tithe laws of the Mishnah "probably reflect the practices observed for the most part in the Persian and Greek periods."

It was believed that tithe payments as legislated by Scripture helped bring about the continuation of this special relationship. The giving of the tithe was part of a reciprocity through which material goods were exchanged for divine blessing and protection. Thus the tithe can be treated as part of a gift-exchange system. This view of the tithe is supported by illustrations of gift-exchange sys- tems that have been identified in other cultures. Gift-exchange is explained as a set of systematically perpetuated reciprocities that sustain and nurture relations between parties who may be of unequal status. Economic consider- ations do not represent the primary motivation of gift-exchange systems. Tangible goods-foods in particular-are regularly exchanged over long periods of time for intangible necessities, such as protection and blessing. Marcel Mauss has referred to the type of gift-exchange systems that involve moral judgments or religious sanctions as "prestations systems."" Inter- preting the tithe in light of Mauss's work enables one to see the tithe as a prestation type of gift-exchange. Mauss developed the term "prestation" for gift-giving when it is systematically perpetuated within the community or group, thereby distinguishing it from the occasional gift given by an individual; from taxes, fines, fees, and inheritance payments; and from com- merce in general. Anthropology is not summoned in this study to "prove" that our char- acterization of the biblical tithe law is "correct." Considering the Pentateuch on its own terms enables us to make the case for this view of the biblical tithe ordinances without reaching to other disciplines. We simply suggest that more clarity and nuance is gained when the tithe law is considered against the background of systems of exchange in other cultures that parallel elements of the tithe law of the Pentateuch. The form and function of Penta- teuchal tithe ordinances may be illuminated further as a result of such com- parisons. That is to say, there is a value to examining religious ordinances of the Pentateuch in anthropological terms without reducing them to such terms. Before we consider the tithe in itself, it is important that we locate our proposal as regards ethnographic parallels within the context assigned by 11.

Robert Culley has classi- fied in three groups those scholars who have combined anthropology with Bible study. They include "anthropologists who have turned to the Bible, biblical scholars who have drawn upon anthropological research, and bibli- cal scholars who have sought to exploit sociological theory.""2 Our approach, as may be surmised, reflects the second and third categories in Culley's summary. Over the years scholars have turned to the works of W. Robertson- Smith, Max Weber, James Frazer, Theodore Gaster, and Mary Douglas- to name but a few of the better-known anthropologists-for evidence from other cultures that might prove useful to an historical reconstruction of Israelite institutions. Robert Wilson's view is a clear example of this focus: "Both ancient Israel and the sacred text that it produced were part of a com- plex cultural system and the theological implication of this fact must now be explored."'3 Today, however, a different relationship has begun to emerge for anthropology and biblical research. There are scholars in these fields who now recognize connections between a literary analysis of biblical texts and anthropology, notably Mary Douglas and J. G. McConville. Among contemporary anthropologists, Douglas is known for her com- parisons of anthropological data with evidence gleaned from a literary ana- lysis of biblical sources. This is evident from her treatment of the dietary laws in Leviticus, which is now widely accepted in biblical scholarship.'4 Recent work by anthropologists who have studied other cultures finds com- parisons between a literary analysis of the text and anthropology to be instructive. For example, Katrina McLeod has applied this approach in her study of political and philosophical documents of Warring States China, ca. 475-222 B.C.E. According to McLeod, scrutinizing classical texts through the lens of anthropology helps get to the meaning of the text. Thus, McLeod believes that the joining of literary analysis with anthropological research 12. Robert C. Culley, "Exploring New Directions," in The Hebrew Bible and Its Modern Interpreters, ed.

Moreover, the exchange of goods represents a type of communication system that enables donor and recipients to relate with one another in a meaningful way. Therefore, according to Douglas, any theory of consump- tion must be tied to a theory of social policy.'6 Which goods are exchanged, how such exchanges are effected, and by whom, are issues that inform a dis- cussion of the theory of gift-exchange. Gifts cannot be understood as separate items. They belong to a category that differs from such transactions as trade exchanges, taxes, fines, fees, and inheritance payments. Consensus among scholars suggests that the category of gift-exchange is to be viewed always as a whole system of exchanges, not as one gift. Much of the credit for articulating this concept goes to Mauss, who generalized about certain patterns of exchange found in many cultures. Mauss (1872-1950), a French sociologist, grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family, though he was not traditionally observant.'7 Mauss was Emile Durkheim's nephew and "most distinguished pupil."'8 Under Durk- heim, Mauss studied philosophy and later went on to study historyof reli- gion, Sanskrit, and Indian texts at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. Mauss worked closely with Durkheim and collaborated with him on essays that treated the history of religion and various ethnographic issues: "It was, on the whole, Mauss who, with his great sense of the concrete, had an eye for the illuminating fact, while the theoretical interpretation generally originated with Durkheim."'9 Following Durkheim's death (1917) Mauss founded in 1925 the Institut d'Ethnologie de l'Universit6 de Paris. The purpose of this organization was to provide sponsorship for the research and writing of young anthropolo- gists. 15. Katrina C. D.

He did not conduct fieldwork; his interpreta- tions of ethnographic data were the result of research and insight. Scholars recognize two trends in Mauss's writing: ethnographic studies (such as The Gift, which appeared in 1925) and methodological issues relat- ing to the social sciences.20 Mauss's interest in "total" phenomena was an outgrowth of his collaborative work with other researchers, including his uncle, Durkheim. According to E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Mauss developed his concept of "total" facts by learning as much as possible about specific cul- tural phenomena. He felt compelled to acquire skills that would enable him to read the writings of a given group in its own language and thereby under- stand from within the phenomena he was studying.21 In his best-known work, The Gift, Mauss argues against the economic aspect of gift-exchange and pleads for a renewed emphasis upon its moral and social elements.22 For Mauss, the relationship between gift-exchange and social structure was primary. Marcel Mauss is regarded as "one of the last encyclopedic minds," yet his influence remains difficult to define due to the extent of his collaborative work with other scholars.23 Nevertheless, his direction can be detected in the ethnological investigations of other researchers, including Claude Levi- Strauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, and Evans-Pritchard. Mauss identified a type of gift-exchange as "prestation" or "total pres- tation." These terms are meant to apply to a type of compulsory gift that falls upon the entire group and all of its social phenomena, including reli- gious, legal, moral, and economic aspects.24 Prestations were regarded by Mauss as being structured around three obligations: the obligation to give, the obligation to receive, and the obligation to repay.25 Through gift-exchange, all things are tied together; the valuables exchanged and the members of the group involved in the exchange were explained by Mauss as possessing personality. For example, he relates how kula partners stare at their valuables in the hope of absorbing virtues they 20. Ibid. 21. Evans-Pritchard, in Mauss, Gift, pp. vii-viii. 22. Ibid., p. ix. 23.

What benefit accrues to the giver? Self-interest. The Kwakiutl chief gave gifts not only on his own behalf, but for his son, son-in-law, and daughter as well.27 Mauss recognized that valuables used in the kula system also pos- sessed an economic valence. By exchanging them a kula partner improved his position economically, as his partner would seek to outdo him in giving greater amounts as gifts. To receive was also construed by Mauss as a demonstration of power, because not to receive, as in the case of the pot- latch system of the Kwakiutl, was to show fear or loss of dignity.28 The obli- gation to repay was no less significant to Mauss. For example, potlatch gifts were destroyed if they were not repaid. Gifts given as prestations were thought by Mauss to have power as part of their personality. Among the Maori, goods given as gifts were character- ized by Mauss as possessing a hold over the recipient.29 Furthermore, Mauss maintained that gifts given as prestations could buy or bring about peace between groups and deflect evil forces. Thus gifts given to men in the sight of gods or to gods themselves articulated the morality that was considered by Mauss to be implicit in prestation systems. He makes the same point with regard to zedaqa in the Hebrew Bible, which, according to Mauss, at first had the meaning of "justice" and later "alms."30 Gifts of food were taken by Mauss to forge a "most irrevocable link" between donor and recipient; they were also the most dangerous type of gift to accept.3' He noted that among the Hindu the recipient was dependent upon the temper of the donor. "Thus a man does not eat with his enemy."32 Mauss also considered the way a gift bound partners and their essences together in a form of contract. Among the Trobriand Island kula partners, a 26.

Reports from fieldwork done by Malinowski and other anthropologists were not the only source of evidence employed by Mauss. He also made use of Roman records as well as Hindu and German documents. He used them to articulate an evolutionary scheme for gifts. Because the prestation involved the corporate personality of the group, it was seen to represent a developmental stage preceding the type of gift-exchange which Mauss found in Rome and Greece. He characterized the gift-exchange associated with classical civilization as signaling the emergence of the individual donor, which did not fully mature until the development of the modern money market.34 Mauss recognized the economic and self-interest aspects of gift- exchange, yet he chose to emphasize the social contract of the prestation in his "study of total human behavior.""35 He concluded: In order to trade, man must first lay down his spear. When that is done he can succeed in exchanging goods and persons not only between clan and clan but between tribe and tribe and nation and nation, and above all between indivi- duals. It is only then that people can create, can satisfy their interests mutually and define them without recourse to arms. It is in this way that the clan, the tribe, and nation have learnt-just as in the future the classes and nation and individuals will learn-how to oppose one another without slaughter and to give without sacrificing themselves to others. That is one of the secrets of their wisdom and solidarity.36 L6vi-Strauss acknowledges the influence of Mauss's prestation concept in his own work and used it in structuring his theory of exchange in kinship 33.

Thus marriage constituted a culmination for gifts and presta- tions that reaffirmed another aspect of Mauss's concept, namely, the role of gift-exchange in forging peace: "The exchange of brides is merely the con- clusion to an uninterrupted process of reciprocal gifts, which effects the transition from hostility to alliance, from anxiety to confidence, from fear to friendship."37 Support-and criticism-of Mauss's prestation theory remain a subject of debate among anthropologists today. For example, Mauss gains support from H. A. Powell's more recent evidence from fieldwork. According to Powell, certain harvest prestations of the Trobriand Islanders constitute a type of Kiriwinan marriage contract for that exogamous group. These pres- tations are viewed by Powell as the responsibility of the clan and are intend- ed to guarantee a wife's material needs as well as those of dependent chil- dren. As a contract, the harvest prestation helps mediate relations between groups that may be represented in a given marriage. Donors of rank are expected to be generous in giving. Moreover, amounts of goods in this system are defined by the status of the recipients as well, though quantities are not rigidly fixed. These goods may be used for "feasts of merit" sponsored by leaders but cannot be recycled as harvest prestations.38 Leopold Pospisil has noted other evidence that sustains Mauss's theory of the three obligations. According to Pospisil, the Kapauku have a strong sense of legal obligation and view gifts in that light. Thus a gift given "creates an automatic obligation on the part of the recipient to return an equivalent.""39 Mauss's theory has also run into criticism from his peers. Annette B. Weiner objects to Mauss's "emphasizing" of the social aspect of exchange. According to Weiner, gift-exchange represents a power system through which control is asserted over exchange partners. She faults Mauss for 37. Claude Levi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship, rev. and trans. by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer, ed.

Moreover, self-interest is paramount in gift-exchange. In the kula system people expend considerable energy to carry out the exchange of gifts because of their desire to further their own interests in status and power: "The Trobriand informants who say they exchange for 'love' or 'generosity' are following a myth that serves in their society to hide a reality of self-interest."40 Therefore norms of reciprocity do not exist outside the members of the group and so are constantly negotiated. This is also disguised by exchange partners when they refer to the failure to reciprocate as breaking social norms.41 Weiner believes that Mauss did not notice that exchange systems extend over time. In analyzing Trobriand exchange, I have indicated that if exchange events are described within a single dimension, that is, transactions of gift and counter gift, the processes of social interaction then appear to be determined by princi- ples of cause and effect. The mistake here is to reduce exchange to an act seen within the limitations of the present rather than to analyze exchange events as comprising a system of regeneration in which the temporal context of genera- tional continuity carries as much weight as economic and political factors.42 Weiner's critique does not aim to debunk Mauss; rather it draws atten- tion to elements of Mauss's theory that call for clarification. She challenges Mauss's view that prestation is a means of achieving peace between parties on the grounds that it does not sufficiently address the question of status and power. Nevertheless, it appears from Mauss's writings that he regards these issues seriously. For example, Mauss asserts that "great acts of gener- osity are not free from self-interest." He further states that "to give is to show one's superiority."43 In a sense, Weiner is the disciple who extrapolates from and elaborates upon the theory of the master, Mauss. She reveals the nuance in his argu- ment that presents status and power as concerns second to peaceful relations 40. Annette B.

Mauss, Gift, p. 72.</page><page sequence="12">62 MENAHEM HERMAN between gift-exchange partners. Weiner then proceeds to make her own contribution to the prestation theory while still appreciating Mauss's pio- neering work. Another critical assessment of Mauss's work is offered by Raymond Firth. He faults Mauss's theory of total prestation on the basis of evidence from Tikopia, where individual gifts are exchanged between individual exchange partners. This stands in contrast with evidence amassed by Mauss from the kula system, which involves the entire group together with a whole range of gifts. Moreover, in Tikopia the thing given is not held to carry the essence of the giver, nor is the moral aspect of the gift significant.44 Firth accepts Mauss's distinction of three aspects of gift-exchange, give- receive-repay, with some reservation. As for the "give" portion of Mauss's theory, Firth says that Mauss essentially conceives of exchange partners being of equal status, whereas this is not typically the case for the groups Mauss discusses, notably the Trobriand Islanders and the Kwakiutl. Firth regards the obligation to "receive" as an ambiguous idea. He says that in the third phase of the prestation, "repay," Mauss does not sufficient- ly recognize how intangibles such as the act of repayment may take the place of tangible goods in this phase of the exchange.45 Firth claims that Mauss makes prestations appear as a type of exchange that functions automatical- ly; that Mauss does not take sufficient account of the complexities inherent in gift-exchange systems; and that he is unaware of the relationship between the size of a gift and the resources of the donor or recipient.46 Though Firth is correct in noting these inconsistencies, Mauss's theory remains intact. We suggest that Mauss may have taken for granted the fact that all material resources are finite. It is merely that Mauss's theory empha- sizes what exchange partners do with the goods at their disposal, under- standing that such goods are not inexhaustible. Another view is expressed by Marshall Sahlins, who argues that the the- ory of the three obligations shows that Mauss did not sufficiently probe gift- exchange to discern its "deeper reality." According to Sahlins, Mauss "con- tinued to understand exchange in the way it is presented to experience- 44.

Ibid., pp. 15-17.</page><page sequence="13">TITHE AS GIFT 63 fragmented, that is to say, into the separate acts of giving, receiving, and repaying."'47 Other researchers appear to offer rebuttal to issues raised by Mauss's critics. Paul Bohannan and George Dalton echo Mauss by claiming that moral aspects adhere to material goods involved in exchange. They further maintain that no transaction can be analyzed apart from kinship, religion, and other social institutions that inform the actions of the exchange part- ners.48 similarly, Sahlins sides with Mauss against Weiner. As noted earlier, Weiner argues that gift-exchange is really an expression of power. Rather than serving as a means of achieving peace between two parties, gift- exchange shows donors and recipients as continuously reevaluating their separate situations and those of their partners. That is, gift-exchange repre- sents an expression of self-interest for Weiner.49 Sahlins, on the other hand, maintains that the prestation brings separate parties together under one contract. They retain their distinct identities even as the gift forges "alliance, solidarity, communion-in brief, peace," especially in the case of primitive societies.50 Mauss's theory of the prestation, having stood the test of time, remains the basis for analysis of gift-exchange. Scholars still favorably regard Mauss's point that social norms such as justice and morality as well as theo- logical tenets of the group are revealed through the prestation system. Though researchers today recognize other characteristics as implicit in gift- exchange, notably its political and economic functions, Mauss's theory remains valid except where it has been contradicted by more recently acquired evidence from fieldwork. There is much in Mauss's theory that resonates with the biblical tithe law. For example, in his study of Deuteronomy, McConville is alert to the "polarities of gift and response" that lend the tithe law a treaty-like char- acter.5' It is at this point that we become aware of possibilities for elucidat- ing biblical tithe ordinances with the aid of Mauss's prestation theory. 47.

Next we shall locate by analogy aspects of biblical tithe legislation that agree with the theory of gift-exchange as explained by Mauss. This will enable us to recognize the tithe as a prestation system in Scripture. Throughout our study we have remained cognizant of the limits for such comparisons. We note that William W. Hallo exercises caution in this area so as to avoid the blurring of important cultural and historical distinctions that mark every group as unique. Speaking of the ancient Near East, he states that "each civilization or ethnic entity is entitled to render account of the past to itself by appropriating to itself that portion of the past which it chooses for itself. I would submit further that such appropriation can, by this very definition of history never be misappropriation."52 Hallo recognizes comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment. However, in the instance of the tithe, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is regarded by scholars as ambiguous, given the lack of strong corroborating data.5 Analogies are therefore sought else- where by us, in the evidence from fieldwork conducted by anthropologists. Here we are not to be disappointed: for tithe giving, relevant evidence from living cultures is plentiful and less problematic than ancient Near Eastern data. Douglas proceeds carefully in reasoning from one culture to another. She is concerned that the "self-evidence" of a given group not be miscon- strued, believing that social and cultural phenomena of a particular com- munity should not be analyzed out of context. Nevertheless, "intuitions of sameness" suggest that all peoples deal with the natural world in remark- ably similar ways.

It may be objected that such an infinite number of possible classifications of nature operating for such a variety of social relations can be imagined that there is no sense in talking of universes as wholes. But the wholeness that concerns us lies in the finite range of favoured patternings of reality.54 We maintain that analogies can be identified between the Pentateuchal tithe law and Mauss's notion of prestation, and that within the limits sug- gested by Hallo and Douglas, respectively. The following outline of charac- teristics of prestation analogous to tithe characteristics summarizes relevant areas of congruence for the two systems and reflects the position of Mauss. We shall consider areas of congruence for prestation systems and the tithe: 1. Presence of obligations: give, receive, repay. 2. Prestation as responsibility of the group. 3. Prestation as contractual and safeguard of peace (an indication of the moral element in this kind of exchange). 4. Feasting as a setting for gift-exchange. 5. Goods given as gifts sometimes have monetary value. Mauss's Prestation Theory and Pentateuchal Tithe Law A focus of Mauss's prestation theory is the idea of an obligation in three parts. Our reading of Pentateuchal tithe ordinances echoes this view general- ly. Terms used in P to describe the manner in which tithe material is exchanged include "give" and "take/receive," e.g., "Speak to the Levites and say to them: When you take from the Israelites which I have given to you as your share . . ." (Num. 18:26). In the Deuteronomic tradition, refer- ence is also made to "giving" the tithe: "When you have set aside in full the tenth part of your yield-in the third year, the year of the tithe-and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat their fill in your settlements" (Deut. 26:12). Furthermore, these terms are understood by scholars to have parallels in ancient Near Eastern 54.

Lev. 27, an appendix to the Holiness Code, characterizes the provisions stip- ulated therein as given on divine authority: "These are the commandments that the Lord gave Moses for the Israelite people on Mount Sinai" (Lev. 27:34). Through tithe payment all Israel affirms for its part God's promise of protection under the covenant. This theme is rendered specific through the role assigned tithe payment in Num. 18. Interpreted as a "covenant of grant" by Moshe Weinfeld, the tithe is viewed as the Levites' portion: by protecting the sanctuary against lay encroachment they repay the gift of tithe material given them by the Israelites.56 The Levites also give a tithe to the priests, for they too fall under the same covenant that affords them the gift of divine protection, together with the priests and Israelites. Accord- ingly, Israelites and Levites fulfill a corporate responsibility through tithe- giving. Deuteronomic tithe ordinances were not shown to be dissimilar. McConville states that the treaty-like character of Deuteronomy is articu- lated as action and response.57 The Israelite donor responds to God's pres- ent and future promise of blessing through tithe payment. Deut. 14:24 maintains that God has already blessed Israel with a crop yield; the obliga- tion to repay is now theirs to fulfill through the tithe "because the Lord your God has blessed you." Analogies between Mauss's three obligations and the tithe identify the corporate aspect of the tithe law. While the individual donor is liable for the tithe, it is the group that is responsible for compliance with this requirement.

Yet you are defrauding Me. And you ask, "How have we been defrauding You?" In tithe and contribution. (9) You are suffering under a curse, yet you go on defrauding Me-the whole nation of you. (10) Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, and let there be food in My House, and thus put Me to the test-said the Lord of Hosts. I will surely open the floodgates of the sky for you and pour down blessings on you. (Mal 3:8-10) The ethical character of tithing is expressed emphatically in Deuteron- omy. The tithe is a philanthropic duty for the Israelites; its payment engend- ers divine blessing. The objective of prestations, to bring about peace be- tween parties, is thus achieved in two ways. First, fulfilling the ethical requirements of the covenant is the means by which Israel meets its obliga- tions as defined by D's view of the covenant. Living in accord with the prin- ciples of the covenant makes it possible for the two parties, Israel and its God, to live in peace. Second, peace is realized when Deuteronomy's social welfare norms are expressed within the body politic of the Israelite people. The nation as a whole is strengthened when all segments of society are cared for under the covenant. The Deuteronomic texts present feasting at the single sanctuary as a cen- tral feature of its tithe law. According to McConville, "the tithe law is the most outstanding example of the eating theme."'8 McConville makes a con- nection between the eating motif, which he takes to symbolize obedience, and God's blessing of the land.59 An ethical element of the tithe is thus mani- fest: feasting "before God" on tithe material (or food purchased with the silver for which the tithe material was originally exchanged) is an expression of duties fulfilled under the covenant. Other cultures also associate gift- exchange activity with ritualized feasts. For example, gifts are exchanged at ceremonial meals in Polynesia and in other settings.60 Mauss's characterization of the sharing of food as a powerful symbol of unity agrees with the way the Pentateuch presents the tithe as food.

Levi-Strauss, Elementary Structures, pp. 56-58.</page><page sequence="18">68 MENAHEM HERMAN Priestly and Deuteronomic texts generally characterize the tithe in this way. For P tithe material is sustenance for the Levites and priests; according to D it is consumed by the donor and the needy in designated settings. According to Mauss, some goods given as gifts possess economic value in addition to their potent social value. Yet it must be remembered that goods are not exchanged as gifts because they possess economic value, but to effect a relationship between two parties. It is therefore significant that when the text specifies particular agricultural goods as sources of tithe pay- ment, it selects items that possess commercial value in the ancient world. In his study of archaic economics, M. I. Finley cites grain, wine, and oil as con- stituting three of four "fundamental articles of trade," the fourth being slaves.6' Thus the economic significance of the tithe persists alongside its ethical significance. Differences regarding economic development between ancient Israel and the archaic societies surveyed by Mauss are not to be discounted. But socie- ties with different types of economies may still be usefully compared. Doug- las's previously cited concept of "intuitions of sameness" reveals that di- verse groups are known to share certain cultural phenomena. We therefore maintain that Mauss's prestation theory is instructive for the study of the biblical tithe as it is for an understanding of gift-exchange in other cultural settings. Indeed, Mauss makes a point of expressing interest in the rules governing gift-exchange in many social and cultural contexts.62 In the final analysis, the broad scope of Mauss's theory helps rather than hinders research into gift-exchange systems because it imposes few restrictions on its application. Gift-exchange systems include gifts given to persons and to the gods. According to Mauss, "gifts to men and to gods have the further aim of buy- ing peace. In this way evil influences are kept at bay even when not personi- fied."63 Thus Mauss does not limit his prestation theory to gifts exchanged between people. He recognizes that the theory of prestation applies to gifts exchanged with the gods even though this concept is not fully developed by him. Indeed, Mauss does not claim to have explored the theory of prestation in all of its aspects. He leaves that challenge to other scholars. 61. M. I.

We do not set this work up as a model; it simply proffers one or two suggestions. It is incomplete: the analysis could be pushed farther. We are really posing ques- tions for historians and anthropologists and offering possible lines of research for them rather than resolving a problem and laying down definite answers. It is enough for us to be sure for the moment that we have given sufficient data for such an end.64 The tithe can be recognized as a prestation in that it exhibits characteris- tics Mauss attributes to gift-exchange, that is, phenomena that "are at once legal, economic, religious, aesthetic, morphological and so on."65 That Mauss does not explore the idea of a divine counter-gift does not invalidate identifying the tithe as prestation. Reason dictates that the same expectation of a counter-gift would apply in all cases, whether for gifts exchanged be- tween people or with the gods. Mauss's point that gifts to gods buy peace suggests that the tithe together with its divine counter-gift of blessing or protection satisfies the criteria of his prestation theory. In summary, comparisons of the Pentateuchal tithe law with Mauss's prestation theory suggest a certain understanding of the tithe. This is also true of contributions made by anthropologists who have extended Mauss's theory of prestations. We shall now compare relevant findings of previously cited anthropologists who have taken up Mauss's prestation theory, with the tithe law of the Pentateuch. Further Aspects of Prestation Theory Applicable to the Tithe We have noted that Weiner regards gift-exchange systems as protracted relationships. This agrees with P's explicit description of the tithe as a "law for all time throughout the ages" (Num. 18:23) and with D's understanding of the tithe as a didactic tool that enables one to learn to "revere the Lord your God forever" (Deut. 14:23). Thus the relationship of Israel with its God is continued under the covenant through gift-giving. Weiner's view associates prestations with power actualized through the exchange process. She also was shown to fault Mauss for being insufficiently 64. Ibid., p. 76. 65. Ibid.</page><page sequence="20">70 MENAHEM HERMAN attentive to this issue. Similarly, the question of whose interests are served by tithe payment must be considered: Levites are identified as interested parties in the tithe law of Num. 18; in Deut. 26 the Israelite donor seeks assurance that the gift of God's protection and blessing under the covenant will continue without interruption through faithful payment of the tithe. In anthropological terms, tithe-giving is not an exchange of gifts by partners of equal status, but an expression of a contractual relationship between parties who forever remain separate, unequal, and somewhat insecure. No time period for payment of goods given as gifts is specifically given for prestations. This signals the absence of equality or balance in some gift- exchange systems. Sahlins cites Firth's study of Maori gift-exchange, reveal- ing that the longer a recipient delays, the greater the gift given in payment.66 This suggests that exchanges (including barter and market and gift- exchanges) can be located on a continuum that expresses a lesser or greater degree of "sidedness," or personal advantage. The greater the imbalance in the amount of time allowed for giving by the parties, the greater the advan- tage and status represented by the exchange. In Sahlins's words, "the spirit of exchange swings from disinterested concern for the other party through mutuality to self-interest."67 Empirical data analyzed by anthropologists suggest that a delay in repayment exposes the self-interest of partners to the exchange.68 This agrees with the way the tithe is presented in Scripture, wheredthe tithe don- or's claims of scrupulousness in handling tithe material attest to the impor- tance attached to tithe goods being given in an appropriate way (Deut. 26:13-14). Malachi's characterization of tithes given improperly as fraud (Mal. 3:8-10) echoes this point of view. To the extent that the tithe is paid on a timely basis and the amount of tithe goods given as gifts is appropriate, Israelite self-interest is expressed as faithfulness; regular tithe payment sus- tains a continuous flow of divine protection and blessing. The tithe reflects mutality and self-interest-but not disinterest.69 Additionally, it is evident that goods given as gifts are not of one type. We have seen how different cultures assign various goods to be used as pres- 66. Sahlins, Stone Age Economics, pp. 169-170. 67. Ibid., pp. 192-193. 68. Weiner, Women of Value, p. 213. 69.

The Trobriand Islanders, whose prestation systems have been dis- cussed in this study, were shown to utilize an assortment of diverse goods as gifts, including beads, bracelets, and yams. This resonates with tithe legisla- tion in the Pentateuch: "but all of the tithe of the land . . ." (Lev. 27:30). Another comparison with the tithe takes its bearings from Douglas Oliver. He describes competitive gift-giving and feasting among the Siuai,70 a practice that somewhat resembles Pentateuchal tithe law in its Deuteron- omic formulation. Similarly, the competitive enthusiasm associated with tithe-giving is not unlike the spirit of kula exchange partners, who are re- nowned for their willingness to cross open seas in order to carry out the gift transactions. We do not find competition among gift-givers in Pentateuchal sources on the tithe. However, other biblical texts attest to the enthusiasm with which the tithe was paid. One senses the dynamic pace of activity involving tithe-giving in the Chronicler's description of Hezekiah's reform: (5) When the word spread, the Israelites brought large quantities of grain, wine, oil, honey, and all kinds of agricultural produce, and tithes of all, in large amounts. (6) The men of Israel and Judah living in the towns of Judah- they too brought tithes of cattle and sheep and tithes of sacred things con- secrated to the Lord their God, piling them in heaps. (II Chron. 31:5-6) We have observed how Scripture describes the tithe in ways that resem- ble gift-exchange systems in other cultures. Our comparative analysis, therefore, allows us to classify Pentateuchal tithe references generally as sug- gesting a prestation system. It emerges that Mauss's theory is not only an abstract sociological concept but reveals something of the essence of the God-Israel covenant. Mauss regards prestations as symbolic of the totality of a social system, including its religious, economic, and legal aspect. Every- thing that the exchange partners represent, their entire being, becomes man- ifest in the prestation. In similar fashion, the Pentateuch regards Israel and its God as partners in the covenantal relationship described by the tithe. 70. Douglas L. Oliver, A Solomon Island Society: Kinship and Leadership Among the Siuai of Bougainville (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955), pp. 365, 372, 386-390.</page><page sequence="22">72 MENAHEM HERMAN Summary We have interpreted the tithe in light of gift-exchange systems in other cultures. Nevertheless, despite our holistic approach, we do not overlook differences that distinguish P from D with respect to the tithe. In the instance of P, the donor is promised "mere" protection from harm, while in D there is the further promise that he will be showered with abundant bless- ings. Stated in anthropological terms, P views the tithe as status- maintaining, while D views the tithe as enhancing the relationship between God and the tithe donor through feasting and rejoicing. Taken together, these elements of preserving or enhancing the relationship with God consti- tute the totality of human endeavor as suggested by Mauss's "total presta- tion." The faithfulness of the tithe donor shapes that of the nation, and the faithfulness of the nation in turn shapes that of the tithe donor. Having examined facets of gift-exchange and identified the tithe as a prestation system, we now ask: How have we enhanced the understanding of the Pentateuchal tithe law? L6vi-Strauss regards kinship and marriage systems as the greater analo- gue when compared with other systems of exchange. For example, he observes that among the Konyak Naga, who are indigenous to India and Southeast Asia, the exchange of gifts defines a course that leads to marriage between partners to the reciprocity: "In short, the system of prestations re- sults in marriage."7' Levi-Strauss maintains that no gift-exchange is risk- free, even if its purpose is to make peace. Therefore the one who initiates the exchange cycle is exposed to risk, for his efforts may unintentionally engender not friendship but hostility. Such exchanges are "total fact,"72 because the exchange partners have a great deal at stake: the status or posi- tion each party maintains within the context of the exchange, relative to their partners. Indeed, power and status are significant aspects of gift- exchange systems that have been used as comparisons for the tithe. The har- vest prestation, states Powell, "symbolizes the latent subordination of the donor to the recipient.73 Interpreting the tithe as a central element of a prestation system enables one to see how the tithe peacefully orders and joins two unequal parties. 71. Levi-Strauss, Elementary Structures, p. 67. 72. Ibid., pp. 59-60. 73. Powell, "Territory, Hierarchy, and Kinship," p. 592.</page><page sequence="23">TITHE AS GIFT 73 Unlike some gift-exchange systems found in other cultures, the tithe is represented in Priestly and Deuteronomic texts as a cultic institution of min- or importance in strictly textual terms, yet its symbolic value is great because it expresses a theological principle of consequence, namely, coven- ant doctrine. Reasoning by analogy from evidence of gift-exchange in other cultures, we suggest that the tithe constitutes the lesser analogue to the covenant. It resembles, therefore, some gift-exchange systems in other cultures, such as those identified by Levi-Strauss, where the gift represents a first step taken on the path to marriage. This is not unlike the relation between Israel and its God, which the Bible describes in marriage terms, as in Jer. 2:2, 3:1 or Hos. 2:21-22. The tithe provides the means for donors to draw down continuous bless- ings according to D, while P emphasizes the servant-Lord relationship. In both instances, God accepts a risk by initiating a reciprocal relationship with Israel symbolized by the tithe. He presents His people with the means of repaying, with tangible gifts, His intangible gifts of protection and bless- ing. Through this exchange, a relationship is articulated and peace brought about. Rockville, Md.</page></plain_text>
