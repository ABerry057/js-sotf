<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pamela Nadell. Women Who Would Be Rabbis: A History of Women 's Ordination, 1889-1985. Boston: Beacon Press, 1998. xiii, 300 pp. Pamela Nadell begins her history of "women who would have, if they could have, become rabbis" (p. x) with an acknowledgment "that uncovering women's history remains a political enterprise" (p. 13). Surprised to discover so many pre- decessors to today's female rabbis, Nadell enthusiastically traces the repetitive and discouraging history of arguments and efforts by diverse women to enter the rab- binate. Reclaiming these forgotten efforts now that women in the United States re- ceive ordination in the Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative movements contextualizes a struggle for social change. Nadell shows how the desire, energy, and commitment to open Jewish religious leadership to women did not emerge suddenly with the radicalism of the 1960s and the second wave of feminism in America. Rather, it began a century ago as modernity upset established gender roles and reconfigured the place of religion in Jewish life. As the rabbinate lost some of its authority with the widespread adoption of congregationalism by Amer- ican Jews, rabbis' tasks shifted from interpreting law toward pastoral duties. The ability to speak effectively in public, to preach, and to lead congregations in prayer acquired greater salience, encouraging a few women to imagine themselves acting as rabbis. A host of reforms in synagogue services that equalized the positions of men and women accompanied these clerical innovations. Reformers eliminated the mehisah and introduced mixed seating in family pews, they added choirs of men and women to beautify worship, and they created the confirmation ceremony to acknowledge equally the educational accomplishments of girls and boys. Women's responses hastened the transformations in Jewish religious activity. Women eagerly accepted positions as teachers in Sunday schools, rapidly femi- nizing Jewish education. With men working on Saturdays, women often filled seats in synagogues left vacant by absent husbands. The struggle for women's suf- frage kept issues of equality and justice in the consciousness of liberal Jews. Giv- en this milieu, the question of women's ordination arose as a natural and logical next step. Despite its logic, women's efforts to become rabbis repeatedly encountered stiff resistance and a fearful reluctance to overturn the status quo. Nadell chroni- cles the attempts by aspiring women to acquire the education necessary for the rab- 401</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review binate. Most came from distinguished backgrounds and sought to emulate fathers who were rabbis and scholars. In each decade, a few succeeded in studying at He- brew Union College or the Jewish Theological Seminary or the Jewish Institute of Religion with the support of invdividual rabbis and a few fellow students. Some, like Martha Neumark, Henrietta Szold, and Irma Lindheim, are relatvely well known because they crafted impressive careers for themselves. Others, like Dora Askowith, Helen Levinthal, and Avis Shulman, struggled without recognition. But when it came time for liberals like Stephen Wise or Kaufmann Kohler to act deci- sively in support of women's aspirations, these leaders deferred to their conserva- tive colleagues. No woman's accomplishment or erudition led to acceptance as a rabbi in the United States prior to World War II, although Regina Jonas received a rabbinic diploma in Germany in 1935. Nadell devotes attention to the ideological debates-the same arguments for and against women rabbis reappear in almost every decade-but she situates her discussion within a thorough sociopolitical analysis. The almost numbing rep- etition of the arguments suggests that the explanation for the rabbinical opposi- tion to women rabbis lies elsewhere. Nadell finds her answer in a version of"the time was not ripe." Individual women alone, no matter how extraordinary, could not force radical change. A larger cohort was required. Higher education for women had to become widespread. Married women's presence in the professions had to be accepted. Women's religious leadership among Protestants had to in- crease, setting a precedent for Reform Jews and making the idea of women cler- gy more commonplace. Finally, the second wave of feminism sweeping through the United States in the 1960s dramatically changed the atmosphere. The doors opened first for women in the Reform movement, then for Reconstructionists, and, after much struggle, for Conservative Jews. Nadell expects Orthodox women to follow their Jewish sisters. A paradox stands at the heart of this history: the women seeking to enter the rabbinate desired to uphold Judaism, yet they were attacked for attempting to over- throw it. In response, women turned to Jewish tradition for evidence to support their efforts to extend women's leadership. Their eventual success shows how "they used the past to create a revolution" (p. 220). Nadell's sympathies lie with her heroines. In writing their history, she seeks solid ground that will let future women understand the scope of the struggle re- quired "to create their own revolutions" (p. 220). Yet her tale has its cautionary el- ements. Although a reader cannot help but finish the book with admiration for its protagonists and their efforts to become rabbis, Nadell's history suggests that, ul- timately, Jewish women's accomplishments depended more on the sociopolitical configuration of the historical moment than on their own agency. It is a sobering conclusion. Deborah Dash Moore Vassar College Poughkeepsie, New York 402</page></plain_text>
