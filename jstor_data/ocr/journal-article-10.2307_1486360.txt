<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moses Mendelssohn. Jerusalem: or, On Religious Power and Judaism. Trans- lated by Allan Arkush, Introduction and Commentary by Alexander Altmann. Hanover, N.H., and London: University Press of New England, for Brandeis University Press, 1983. vii, 254 pp. Moses Mendelssohn's Jerusalem is a work of classic stature for European and modern Jewish studies, and it is offered now to the English- reading public in a translation and commentary commensurate with its significance. A felicitous harmony between translator and commentator has been achieved in this volume, the German text of the original having found its precise and appropriate equivalent in Allan Arkush's translation,' while the full dimensions of Mendelssohn's thought are brought out in Alexander Altmann's rich commentary. This commentary and the introduction to the text are themselves eloquent and exemplary models of scholarship, a gift offering by the doyen of Mendelssohn studies.2 1. Arkush handsomely accomplishes his stated goal of rendering an English translation "more philosophically exact" than those which preceded it (p. vii). Cf., for example, his transla- tions of Freiheit as "liberty" (pp. 34 f.), wohlwollen and wohlthun as "benevolence" and "benefi- cence" respectively (pp. 41, 45), and vollkommene Rechte as "perfect rights" (p. 45). Without resorting to paraphrase, he manages to turn the German original into an eminently readable English. A rare lapse in Arkush's attention seems to have occurred, however, on page 43, where the statement that Recht und Gerechtigkeit der Befehl Gottes (cf. Moses Mendelssohn's gesammelte Schriften [Leipzig, 1843], 3:267), which follows Mendelssohn's remark "that serving the state is true service of God," is not translated. 2. Among his many magisterial contributions to this field, mention must be made of Altmann's Moses Mendelssohn's Friihschriften zur Metaphysik (1969) and Moses Mendelssohn: A Biographical Study (1973); as well as of his herculean labors as editor and contributor to the Moses Mendelssohn Gesammelte Schriften Jubilaiumausgabe (1971-). It is in the latter capacity that Altmann has now commented in German upon Jerusalem (vol. 8 [Schriften zum Judentum</page><page sequence="2">114 BOOK REVIEWS As with all valuable gifts, this too has to be earned to be appreciated fully. It assumes a level of erudition that is daunting and stimulating at the same time. The reader who responds to Altmann's challenge will often find himself going back linguistically to German and Latin sources, and return- ing conceptually to many of the philosophical views within underlay the Enlightenment.3 Altmann demonstrates that a full appreciation of Mendels- sohn requires familiarity not only with the ideas of Hobbes, Locke, and Spinoza,4 but also with the thought of Wolff, Leibniz, and Grotius.5 The key issues of church-state relations that occupied philosophers and jurists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are reflected in Mendelssohn's work, and Altmann outlines the varied Deist, Collegialist, and Territorialist stances to which Mendelssohn was responding.6 Nor is Jerusalem devoid of Jewish influences, Altmann argues, devoting a good portion of his introduc- tion to asserting the Jewish provenience of the work. For Altmann, Jerusa- lem has affinities with rabbinic views as well as with attitudes expressed in both medieval Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah.7 This edition of Jerusalem is a challenge to students and teachers of Judaic studies in other ways as well. Mendelssohn was grappling with issues that have become current once again in Jewish and non-Jewish circles, namely, the relation of church and state, and the political nature of Judaism. These issues are intertwined for Mendelssohn with the religious nature of Judaism and with his understanding of the nature of religion in general. Mendelssohn's political philosophy is thus part of his entire, ultimately religious, Weltanschauung. It is a political philosophy which is rooted in a universal morality and rationality which he found consonant with the prin- ciples of Judaism. While both the religious reform and secular socialist movements in Judaism of the last two centuries held positions on these matters akin politically to Mendelssohn's, the major Jewish political II], Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, 1983), the commentary before us representing, as he tells us on page 29 of the introduction, a "revised and abridged version" of the German work. 3. However rich the rewards which await the reader of these notes, his task has not, I am afraid, been facilitated by the manner in which the notes have been keyed to the text, referring as they do to lines which are not explicitly numbered. 4.

With the achievement of statehood, however, and the renascent vigor of Orthodoxy in Israel and the diaspora, the issue of theocracy has again arisen, with renewed urgency. We thus find ourselves, two hundred years after Jerusalem, pondering the same questions Mendels- sohn faced. There is, of course, no ignoring the two hundred years which separate Mendelssohn from us, a period-particularly the latter half-which would seem to have made a mockery of his belief in the essentially benevolent nature of man and the essentially positive nature of the state.8 Nor can we ignore the scholarship that has accumulated in the past two hundred years, and the sophistication it has given us; a sophistication which makes it diffi- cult to accept Mendelssohn's interpretation of Jewish history. This is based on a literal acceptance of biblical history, an interpretation which allowed Mendelssohn to distinguish between an authentic, original period of the faith, beginning at Sinai, in which religious coercion is uniquely defensible, and a later period, beginning with King Saul (!), in which it is not.9 Mendels- sohn's treatment of the later period, essentially that of rabbinic Judaism, is also patently a projection of his own liberal beliefs.'l Yet here another challenge awaits us, as Altmann offers an interpretation of Mendelssohn that forces us to reassess our own sophistication-and his. For Mendelssohn is portrayed as prescribing rather than describing Jewish history. As Altmann says, It is clear that what Mendelssohn attempts is a phenomenology of the Jewish religion in the constructive, not in the descriptive, sense. What he offers is not 8. Ibid., pp. 41 ff., 166 ff. I do not mean to imply by this that Mendelssohn's notion of "benevolence" as intrinsic to man's nature is necessarily repudiated, however battered histori- cally it may be for us. As social beings, perhaps we must continue to affirm it, if on grounds other than Mendelssohn's. However, we do not similarly have to endorse his views concerning the altruistic nature of political institutions per se, or his idealization of the state. 9. Ibid., pp. 90 ff., 127 ff. Though crucial for his view of Judaism as a "revealed legislation," Mendelssohn's attitude to history is actually ambivalent, as Altmann shows, pp. 17 f. Mendels- sohn's political philosophy is predicated upon the reality, even desirability, of a depoliticized Judaism, i.e., of the state of affairs which presumably followed the falling away from the original "authentic" period of the faith, that in which the "Mosaic constitution" was the sole law of the land, and God himself the king. 10. Cf., for example, Mendelssohn's analysis of the rabbinic attitude to prescribing punishments for violation of the Halakhah, ibid., p. 130; and see Altmann's comments, p. 232.</page><page sequence="4">116 BOOK REVIEWS a picture of Judaism as it had crystallized historically and was still largely intact in his period but an idealized image of the faith as he believed it to have existed in the ancient past. This image of the original Judaism was meant to serve as a blueprint for the anticipated era of civil admission." Seen in this light, we can more readily appreciate Mendelssohn's under- standing of Judaism, his view of a politically liberal and universal rational faith, one which yet has its own distinctive character and voluntarily accept- ed set of laws. This is a Judaism familiar and attractive to many in the West, yet one that calls for a contemporary philosophical defense. Mendelssohn thus poses a challenge to contemporary Jewish philosophers and theolo- gians alike, as well as to political scientists and historians. All these people may take inspiration from his very audacity, from the creative genius which fashioned Judaism in a liberal image. They may also find much to recom- mend in Mendelssohn's essentially ahistorical and apolitical view of norma- tive Judaism. Taking issue with Lessing and others, Mendelssohn believed that mankind as a whole does not continually progress."2 Progress is rather to be found in the personal sphere, each individual making his own way forward or backward in life. This is a view we can more easily endorse, it seems to me, in this age of false messiahs. As scholars there are limits to interpretation which we must acknow- ledge; as teachers there are visions to which we need to point. One such vision is that offered in Jerusalem, and it is the great achievement of the current translation and commentary that they have brought this vision within our sights. Alfred L.
