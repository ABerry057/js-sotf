<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Isaac Rabinowitz. A Witness Forever: Ancient Israel's Perception of Literature and the Resultant Hebrew Bible. Occasional Publications of the Department of Near Eastern Studies and the Program of Jewish Studies, Cornell University. Bethesda, Md.: CDL Press, 1993. xvii, 148 pp. This posthumous volume serves both as a tribute to the scholarly career of Isaac Rabinowitz and as a fitting inaugural volume for the Occasional Publications series of the Department of Near Eastern Studies and the Program of Jewish Studies at Cornell University. The volume contains an index combining subject matter, Hebrew terms, and biblical citations, and a bibliography of the author. In addition, David I. Owen and Ross Brann, in their afterwords, contribute appropriate remarks about the author, giving us insight into his personality and career. Rabinowitz focuses on the question of how ancient Israel perceived its own literature and proceeds to demonstrate the relevance of this perception to the understanding of the nature and function of the Hebrew Bible. He develops his monograph in six chapters. Chapter 1 concerns ancient Israel's assumptions about the nature and power of words. According to Rabinowitz, the ancient Israelites did not see words merely as linguistic symbols of referents, as we do today, but as identical with the referents, possessing extraordinary attributes and powers. Word and reality were inseparable. Words were taken to be concentrated essences or inner characters of their respective real referents. The degree of power of a word depended upon the "soul" which uttered it. Readers influenced by James Barr will find Rabinowitz's assumption about the "soulishness" of words, a la Johannes Pedersen, objectionable. Because "holy words" were the most powerful of all words, the editors of the Hebrew Bible employed euphemisms in pejorative statements about God and the king: "Bless [actually: curse] God and die" (Job 2:9) and "David spurned the enemies of the Lord"-actually David spurned the Lord (2 Sam. 12:14). In chapter 2, Rabinowitz discusses ancient Israel's beliefs about the literary process under five headings: literacy, reading, writing, book, and literary witness. In an additional section, he treats some possible misconceptions 125</page><page sequence="2">126 BOOK REVIEWS about the argument of his essay. Rabinowitz argues convincingly that literacy was widespread in ancient Israel, though not all of his arguments are equally persuasive. Someone who can append his name as a witness to a contract is not necessarily literate (p. 27). Contracts were prepared by trained scribes and read aloud, then signed by the witnesses, who need not have been able to read. While today the author of a literary work is known and reading is often a solitary and silent act, in ancient Israel authors/compilers were seldom known and reading was mostly a speech-act. Even meditation may have been a speech-act. The main function of written texts in ancient Israel was to serve as living witnesses-hence, the title A Witness Forever Chapter 3 deals with selected literary and rhetorical consequences of ancient Israel's perception of literature under five headings: words as future historical "realities," words addressed to unwitting or insentient addressees, wishes or hopes stated as accomplished actualities, the "booking" of future "realities," and the reading-out of "booked realities" as means of their effectuation. In ancient Israel, prophetic speech was considered effective even if not heard by the addressee. But, I wonder, was prophecy viewed as effective because of the power of words in themselves or because of the God who stood behind the words of the prophet? Chapter 4 treats the textual consequences of ancient Israel's conception of "holy words" under three headings: the editorial or redactional "hand" as manifested in Scripture, the ordering and sequence of texts containing "holy words," and conflation of texts. Editorial caution in the handling of "holy words" led to two important textual consequences. First, it was a main factor in bringing the prophetic materials of literary prophecy into their present order and sequence. Second, it was ultimately responsible for the textual conflation evident throughout the Hebrew Bible. Rabinowitz suggests that the term ne'^'m introduces paraphrased citations, while the term 'amar introduces exact quotations (p. 71). In chapter 5, Rabinowitz presents The Book of the Upright as a proto- type of our Hebrew Bible. After a detailed exegesis of 2 Samuel 1:18 and Joshua 10:12-14, Rabinowitz concludes that The Book of the Upright was not merely an anthology of epic poems, as is commonly held, but a literary work containing prose and poetry, with injunctions binding on the people, especially their leaders, and promises binding on the Lord of Hosts. In chapter 6, Rabinowitz grapples with the meaning of the Hebrew Bible taken as a literary whole, viewed through the eyes of the ancient Israelites. Rabinowitz finds problems with the normative approaches to the Hebrew</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 127 Scriptures. The Christian perception of "Old Testament" (monothematic, because relevant only insomuch as the Hebrew Bible prefigures Christ) and the Jewish perception of Tenakh (a tripartite division of the books) keep us from grasping the true twofold unity of the Hebrew Scriptures, namely Torah and Attestation. Torah is divine revelation, the "creating" words of God. Attestation is the human response, the "attesting" words of man. The Hebrew Bible, then, constitutes the "cosmic dialogue" between God and man. Rabinowitz terms Israel the "link-people," by which he means that they link God to the whole of humanity. While Rabinowitz claims that his monograph can be read profitably by readers who do not know Hebrew, this reviewer considers a knowledge of Hebrew essential in evaluating his arguments. Students of the social history of biblical Israel, of Bible exegesis, and of Hebrew language will be challenged by many elements of Rabinowitz's essay. Most importantly, Rabinowitz challenges us with a wholistic view of the Hebrew Bible, rooted in exegesis and thought. Jerome A.
