London: Legenda, 2007. xiii, 363 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001499 At a time when a great deal of thought and attention is rightly paid to present ing diversity in the highest ranks of literature, it is startling to see just how little of that attention is devoted to Yiddish. Say what you will of the status of Yiddish as a living vernacular, the status of its belles lettres as some of the finest in any language is unassailable. And at the pinnacle of its prose stand many of the works of David Bergelson (1884?1952). Perhaps best known for his depictions of the decline, decay, and ultimate demise of Jewish bourgeois life in the peri-revolutionary Russian empire, Bergelson was a consummate craftsman of the nuanced modernist stylistics that have since become known as Yiddish impressionism. Even though canonized not only almost unanimously by Yiddish scholars but also in a wider range by a number of fine translations into other modern languages, and even though 469</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews memorialized through his execution along with the last of the Soviet Yiddish intel ligentsia at the hands of Stalin's henchmen on August 12, 1952, it is the full depth and scope of a sometimes brilliant, sometimes conflicted life in letters that has not usually been given much, if any, attention. This attitude has been slowly changing, and the sea change has now been enshrined in the current volume, DavidBergelson: From Modernism to Socialist Realism. This invaluable collection of essays is the outgrowth of a conference on Bergelson's life and work held at Oxford in 2005. In many ways, that conference and this book have formalized the Bergelson "industry" in the academy and identified the essential ligatures to Yiddish literary studies in general, to Central and Eastern European comparative intellectual history, as well as to the ever growing field of Soviet Yiddish research. Bergelson's life and career are relatively easily periodized, which makes for rather neat analytic rubrics (a welcome situation for scholars). Born in Ukraine, Bergelson published his first work in 1909, and through the early interwar period he worked mostly in Kiev, where he was at the center of a group of talented writers who used to gather at his house. Known as the kiev grupe (Kiev Group), these authors produced a body of sophisticated modernist prose and poetry that is the equal of much of the contemporary and literatures of the period. Between the First World War and the ferment of the revolution and the subsequent civil wars was a time of upheavals reflected both in Bergelson's peripatetic lifestyle and in his work. Ultimately, the anti-Jewish violence of the early 1920s led to the exodus not only of Bergelson and his young family but of a number of Yiddish literary and intellectual figures to the growing expatriate Jewish community of Berlin. Bergelson's Berlin period (1921-33) allowed some respite from the politi cal and social turmoil. This period saw not only a continued productivity, experi menting with new techniques and forms, but also the publication of a six-volume collection of his works, as well as various translations. The worldwide economic crisis following the stock market crash of 1929 and ultimately the accession to power of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists brought with it a dilemma for the Yiddish writers in Germany: whether to go West, most likely to the United States, to Palestine, or to the Soviet Union, which was promoting and supporting its own Soviet Yiddish culture through various intellec tual institutions; in other words, one could actually make a living as a Yiddish writer. For ideologically sympathetic artists, including Bergelson, the choice was clear. The ever-changing face of Stalin's orthodoxies would ultimately doom so many writers and intellectuals. But it is only through the clear lens of hindsight that the warning portents are so clear. During the final phase of Bergelson's creative life, his artistic autonomy was oppressed by the heavy yoke of what came to be (by Stalin's fiat) the official state aes thetic orthodoxy, namely, socialist realism. For artists whose creative talents did not gravitate to that medium, compromises had to be made in order to survive. Bergelson, too, was not immune. His later works show the strain of such constraints. During the growing anti-Soviet fervor in the West, when the project of creating a canon in trans lation, for example, was coming into its own, these later works of Bergelson survived neither the qualitative nor the ideological litmus test. As a result, they were considered 470</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews relatively unworthy of study. Among the many notable achievements of the present volume is the reclamation of these texts as objects of thoughtful and fruitful analysis. The picture that emerges of Bergelson from these years is that of an artist working under severe restrictions who nevertheless attempts, in surreptitious and subtle ways, to achieve something artistically new. It is doubtless a pattern that was sadly repeated in the works of many a writer. Disentangling the threads and uncovering the submerged is a project ably furthered in this book. Included in this volume are more than a dozen articles by some truly world class scholars on a wide variety of aspects of Bergelson's work, organized roughly chronologically. Taken as a whole, this offers the distinct benefit of allowing us to see the broad arc of Bergelson's productivity, noting its shifting concerns as well as personal, social, and ideological anxieties. The detailed opening biographical essay and the reminiscences of Bergelson's son, Lev, add informative as well as humaniz ing context for the studies which follow. Though left unrepresented are some of the interesting topics presented in the conference itself, it is still to the volume's credit that it covers not only many of Bergelson's classic works (e.g., "Language and Style in Nokh alemen [1913]: Bergelson's Debt to Flaubert"; "Yoysef Shor [1922]: Between Two Worlds"; and "Narrating the Revolution: From 'Tsugvintn' [1922] to Mides-hadin") but also some of the lesser-studied genres such as Bergelson's remarkable contribution to children's literature ("For Children and Adults Alike: Reading Bergelson's 'Children's Stories' [1914-1919] as Narratives of Identity Formation") and his publicistics ("From Mourning to Vengeance: Bergelson's Holo caust Journalism [1941-1945]"). The volume concludes with a full bibliography of Bergelson's works and English translations of two of Bergelson's critical essays, one of which ("Three Centers") offers a seminal account of the attraction of Yiddish writers to the Soviet Union and the future they envisioned there for Yiddish. In sum, this handsome work promises to endure for some time as a touchstone in the study of this important figure and his time. Jordan Finkin University of Oxford Oxford, England</page></plain_text>
