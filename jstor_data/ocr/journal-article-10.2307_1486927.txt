<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Sorkin. Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment. Berke- ley: University of California Press, 1996. xxv, 214 pp. David Sorkin's monograph provides a succinct but comprehensive survey of Moses Mendelssohn's major Jewish works, both Hebrew and German, in the service of an overarching interpretation of his Jewish thought. Criticizing views that see Mendelssohn, the person and thinker, as divided against himself--"a heathen in his brain and a Jew in his body," to cite Solomon Steinheim-Sorkin reverts to the view of Mendelssohn's first biographer, Isaac Euchel, in arguing for a more harmonious interpretation of both the person Mendelssohn and his thought. For Sorkin, as for Euchel or for</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 301 Mendelssohn's nineteenth-century biographer, Meyer Kayserling, the two faces of Mendelssohn, the Socrates of Berlin and the Moses of Dessau, are, in truth, one face. Similarly, "Mendelssohn's full belief in revealed religion and full-scale participation in enlightenment thinking" (p. xxi) should be seen as entirely consistent, as two complementary sides of the same coin. Sorkin, however, attempts to place this rather traditional unitary picture on a firm scholarly basis, both textual and contextual. The textual key to the unitary picture is the concept of "practical knowledge," which for Sorkin constitutes the unifying principle underlying Mendelssohn's many and diverse works. The contextual key is two-sided. Sorkin claims that Mendelssohn synchronically belonged to the eighteenth- century religious enlightenment, a movement composed of moderate Protes- tants, Anglicans, Catholics, and Jews, while diachronically he drew upon and in a sense revived what Bernard Septimus has called the "'Andalusian' tradition in medieval Jewish thought," a tradition including Saadya Gaon, Judah Halevi, and Nahmanides, but significantly not Maimonides (p. xxii). This dual context provides the missing link between Mendelssohn's commit- ments to revelation and to the enlightenment, since both the eighteenth-century religious enlightenment and the Andalusian tradition, itself a type of medieval religious enlightenment, sought, in varying ways, "to put enlightenment [thinking] in the service of revealed religion" (p. xxi). Moreover, text and context reinforce each other, because, so Sorkin argues, both enlightenments aimed to create a "practical rationalism" through a broad-based curriculum. In general, Sorkin's picture of Mendelssohn's thought, while not ignoring its modern, innovative, and dynamic elements, emphasizes its traditional, conser- vative, and static features. Mendelssohn, Sorkin states repeatedly, "used novel means for conservative ends." Similarly, the main tenets of Mendelssohn's faith, despite minor variations, remained unchanged throughout his life. "Judaism was a religion of practical knowledge (divine legislation), grounded in history, maintained by oral transmission, and based on heteronomy" (p. xxiv; cf. p. 148). Unfortunately, Sorkin does not succeed in substantiating his bold and challenging interpretation. Sorkin's textual key, the concept of practical knowledge, becomes, in his hands, so multiform, so changing, so protean that it soon loses any clear and firm meaning. It encompasses certain metaphysical arguments for God's existence insofar as they provide "vital efficacious knowledge" (p. 12), the theoretical knowledge of good and evil (p. 63), aesthetics (p. 49), applied ethics (p. 12), natural religion (p. 50), and revealed</page><page sequence="3">302 BOOK REVIEWS divine legislation (pp. xxiv, 55). Further, in accordance with the all-purpose nature and function of practical knowledge, Mendelssohn allegedly finds it being taught in the most diverse books of the Bible: in Ecclesiastes (p. 35), in the Psalms (pp. 46, 50), and, most significantly, in the Pentateuch (pp. 56-65). Indeed, for Sorkin's Mendelssohn, even such genres or modes of writing as commentary (p. 13) and history (p. 78) provide practical knowledge. Unfortunately, in none of these instances do we find the slightest mention of practical knowledge in the primary sources to which Sorkin refers. In truth, Mendelssohn never used the term "practical knowledge," which leads one to question whether, in fact, he recognized the existence of such a concept. Thus in his famous essay "On the Question: What Is Enlight- enment?", dealing with the relationship between practical and theoretical matters, an essay to which Sorkin devotes precisely part of one sentence (p. 147), Mendelssohn states that both "(objective) rational knowledge" and the "(subjective) facility in rational reflection about matters of human life" belong to theoretical matters and not to practical matters. It would appear that for Mendelssohn all knowledge is theoretical and not practical, which is not to say-and this seems to be the source of Sorkin's confusion--that theoretical knowledge may not at the same time be vital and efficacious. Nor is Sorkin's contextualization without its problems. To be sure, the idea of Mendelssohn as part of a transconfessional eighteenth-century re- ligious enlightenment is appealing, and Sorkin has developed this idea in several essays.' But in the present work this religious enlightenment and Mendelssohn's place in it remain shadowy and undefined. By contrast, Sorkin does have a great deal to say about Mendelssohn as reviving the Andalusian tradition in medieval Jewish thought, but precisely here Sorkin's contentions appear questionable. One may question whether it is altogether possible to speak of a tradition in Jewish thought encompassing such radically diverse figures as Saadya, Halevi, and Nahmanides, but to examine this with the fullness it deserves would take us too far afield. Here we simply wish to show that Sorkin, in accordance with his notion of Mendelssohn's revival of an Andalusian tradition that includes Halevi but excludes Maimonides, consistently exaggerates Mendelssohn's 1.

Referring to Mendelssohn's commentary on Exodus 20:2, "I am the Eternal, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt," Sorkin argues that "Mendelssohn's insistence on the centrality of the Exodus and the revelation at Sinai reveals his proximity to Judah Halevi and thus his distance from Maimonides" (p. 129). But in the very same passage in the Biur Mendelssohn specifically criticizes Halevi's understanding of the significance of this verse.2 Nor should this be surprising. For Halevi, the reason why God identified Himself at Sinai as the redeemer from Egypt and not the creator of the world is that a rational approach to God based on creation leaves us only with the highly inadequate notion of the God of the philosophers, while the true God, the God of Abraham, may be known only on the basis of His miraculous acts in history. For Mendelssohn, by contrast, natural religion, based on reason, provides us with a perfectly adequate conception of God. In his view-and here he follows Maimonides' position as set forth in Laws of Idolatry, chapter 1-Abraham arrived at his knowledge of God through reason and not through prophecy, and consequently the God of Abraham is the God of the philosophers. The significance of the book of Exodus, for Mendelssohn, is that God, by redeeming the Israelites, became their sovereign, which sovereignty, in turn, endows the law God revealed to them with authority. I would have thought that this fundamental difference between Halevi and Mendelssohn was a truism, but it seems that scholars sometimes, in their understandable desire to set forth new and bold theses, forget basic truisms. Two examples must suffice to show how, in this reviewer's opinion, Sorkin misses Mendelssohn's reliance on Maimonides on fundamental issues. First, Sorkin claims (pp. 70-71) that Mendelssohn's treatment of the problem of biblical anthropomorphisms (e.g., his explanation that God's descending means His condescending) follows the grammatical approach of the Rashbam and not the philosophical method of Maimonides. This is a plain misreading of Mendelssohn's text. To the contrary, in the three places in the Biur where Mendelssohn offers this explanation (Gen. 11:5; Exod. 3:8, 19:20),3 he 2. Mendelssohn characterizes Halevi's explanation as bilti mspkt. It would appear that Sorkin vocalized mspkt as mesupeket, in which case Mendelssohn is saying that Halevi's explanation is indubitable. In truth, as the context makes perfectly clear, mspkt should be vocalized as maspeket, that is, according to Mendelssohn, Halevi's explanation is inadequate. 3. The comment on Genesis 11:5 is by Mendelssohn's collaborator, Solomon Dubno.</page><page sequence="5">304 BOOK REVIEWS explicitly states that he is following the approach of Maimonides, and refers the reader to Guide 1:10. Second, and even more significant, Sorkin argues (p. 56) that Mendelssohn, in his comment on Genesis 24:8, "defines the concepts of truth and faith in a practical manner . . . based on the identity between the soul's contents and the external world." But, as anyone familiar with the Guide will immediately realize, this definition is based upon, and is almost verbally identical with, Maimonides' famous definition of truth and belief in Guide 1:50. This example by itself should suffice to call into question Sorkin's entire distinction between practical and speculative rationalism, though it may be noted that Mendelssohn does give Maimonides' definition an interesting ethical twist. As my last point indicates, I do not want to go to the opposite extreme and argue that Mendelssohn was a Maimonidean. What I do want to claim is that only to the extent that we appreciate the full scope of Mendelssohn's reliance on Maimonides will we also be in a position to appreciate the interesting and significant ways in which he deviated from him. Even if we cannot accept Sorkin's overall interpretation of Mendelssohn's thought, his survey of Mendelssohn's writings is not without value. He provides thoughtful and informative discussions of such generally neglected works as the commentary on Maimonides' Logical Terms (pp. 18-21), the commentary on Ecclesiastes (pp. 35-45), and Ritual Laws of the Jews (pp. 105-107). He even has something new and interesting to say about Mendelssohn's much-discussed theory of the relationship between church and state as set forth in the first part of Jerusalem (pp. 121-125). Yet this survey's value is greatly diminished by two serious flaws. First, in his attempt to stress the traditionalist side of Mendelssohn, Sorkin consistently downplays or glosses over some of the modern and problematic aspects of his writings. For example, though Sorkin seems aware that Mendelssohn's first Hebrew work, Koheleth Mussar, uses the "unconventional form" (p. 15) of a moral weekly, consisting of essays written in a distinctly eighteenth-century style, he repeatedly refers to it as a "commentary on Hebrew texts" (pp. 16, 18, 23, and 35). So skewed a description apparently reveals Sorkin's desire to attribute to the work a more traditional cast and thereby mute its rather modem flavor. In a similar vein, Sorkin argues that Mendelssohn's description of the "man of faith" in one of the essays in Koheleth Mussar is simply a slightly modernized presentation "of the venerable ideal of the 'pious scholar' (talmid hakham)" (p. 17), passing over the fact that Torah study does not occupy nearly as important</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 305 a place in the life of Mendelssohn's man of faith as it does in the life of the traditional talmid hakham.4 Even more revelatory, Sorkin refers (p. 79) to Mendelssohn's letter of November 1771 to Johan Georg Zimmermann and his well-known letter of November 29, 1770 to Lessing, but he neglects to mention that in the former letter Mendelssohn both acknowledges the possibility that the Masoretic texts of Psalms and Ecclesiastes may be corrupt in some places and refers to a number of psalms, all of which are traditionally viewed as being divinely inspired, as "very mediocre poems,"'5 while in the latter letter he gives expression to what appears to be, at the very least, a rather cavalier attitude to the moral character of a number of highly revered biblical worthies.6 The second, even graver flaw is Sorkin's inadequate control of Mendelssohn's medieval Hebrew sources, both philosophical and exegetical. This flaw irremediably impairs what potentially could have been the most important and innovative contribution of Sorkin's study, namely, his attempt to use the Biur as a major source for reconstructing Mendelssohn's Jewish thought. The Biur, as Mendelssohn and his collaborator Solomon Dubno state, is based on the commentaries of the great medieval pashtanim, Rashi, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, and Ramban. And many individual comments in the Biur are, indeed, explicitly identified as deriving from one or more of these commentaries. It would appear that Sorkin assumed that wherever a comment is not so identified it reflected Mendelssohn's or Dubno's own original interpretation.7 But even a cursory comparison of the Biur with a standard rabbinic Bible will reveal 4. See Meir Gillon, Kohelet Mussar le-Mendelssohn 'al Reka Tekufato (Jerusalem, 1979), p. 129. 5. For a translation of the letter, see Alexander Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn: A Bio- graphical Study (University, Ala., 1973), p. 275. Given Mendelssohn's staunch and unbending affirmation of the reliability of the Masoretic text of the Pentateuch, one wonders if, in his comment here about possible textual corruptions, Mendelssohn may have been tacitly anticipating the position of Shadal, who defended the reliability of only the Pentateuchal Masoretic text, to the exclusion of the Masoretic text of the rest of Scripture. 6. Compare Sorkin's inadequate discussion of this important letter with the insightful analyses to be found in Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, pp. 255-256; and Allan Arkush, Moses Mendelssohn and the Enlightenment (Albany, N.Y., 1994), pp. 204-207. While more, in my view, still remains to be said about this letter, at least Altmann and Arkush have asked the right questions. (Full translations of the letter are to be found in both Altmann and Arkush.) 7. Thus the only comments from the Biur that Sorkin identifies as being derived from the medieval commentaries are those explicitly identified as such in the Biur itself.</page><page sequence="7">306 BOOK REVIEWS that the great majority of these unidentified comments are similarly based upon or at times taken verbatim from the above-mentioned commentaries.8 To cite some examples of unidentified comments that Sorkin considers to be Mendelssohn's own original interpretations: the comment on Moses' encounter with God at the burning bush (Exod. 3:11-12) is based largely on Rashi; the comment on the new covenant God established with Israel after the sin of the golden calf (Exod. 34:10) is based on Ibn Ezra and the Ramban; the comment on the providential significance of Moses' Egyptian education (Exod. 2:3), which Sorkin sees as part of Mendelssohn's polemic against the "contemporary historical-critical scholarship" of J. G. Eichorn (p. 82), is taken verbatim from Ibn Ezra. The list could go on. Of course, the fact that the great majority of Mendelssohn's comments in the Biur are based on medieval sources does not mean that the work cannot serve as an important source for his thought. One can ask what criteria Mendelssohn used in deciding between conflicting interpretations, examine how he spliced different sources together, take note of his subtle but oftentimes significant reworking and reshaping of the sources he cites, and the like.9 But one thing is certain. We will not even begin to know the proper questions to put to the Biur much less arrive at any answers, if we, like Sorkin, overlook the full dimensions of its reliance on the medieval exegetical tradition. An even more disturbing manifestation of Sorkin's inadequate control of the field of classical parshanut are the numerous instances where he either misunderstands or mistranslates Mendelssohn's exegetical comments. Again a few examples must suffice. The reason why Mendelssohn adds the parenthetical phrase "(namely, that they accepted the calf not as a guide but rather as a God)" to his translation of Exodus 32:35 is not, contra Sorkin (p. 72), in order to clarify the nature of the Israelites' sin in requesting a golden calf, but in order to offer an answer to a question that troubled all the exegetes, namely, what is it exactly that Aaron saw? (This is clearly borne out by the Biur ad loc.) Again contra Sorkin, Mendelssohn is not saying in his comment on Genesis 2:3 that the account of creation in Genesis I was "an oral tradition 8. Why some of the comments in the Biur taken from the medieval commentaries are so identified while others taken from the same commentaries are not so identified requires further examination. 9. See, in this connection, the incisive observations of Edward Breuer in his important new work, The Limits of Enlightenment: Jews, Germans, and the Eighteenth-Century Study of Scripture (Cambridge, Mass., 1996), pp. 182-183.</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 307 that had gone awry ... and was restored when God gave the correct story to Moses" (p. 83). To the contrary, for Mendelssohn, Moses received the correct creation story from an uncorrupted oral tradition. (Sorkin's error here stems from his mistranslating biketzatam, which means "among some of them," as "in part.") Imprecise translations of a number of Mendelssohn's comments lead Sorkin to confuse the distinct, albeit interrelated, concepts of man's trust in God and God's trustworthiness to fulfill His word (p. 50). I conclude this highly selective list with a particularly egregious error, which encapsulates a number of the flaws listed above. Offering an example of how, for Mendelssohn, the commandments are "forms of practical knowledge rather than abstract truths," Sorkin states, "The observance of the Passover commemorates not the 'gift of blood,' the fact that Israel's firstborn were spared, but the realization of trust through the fulfillment of God's promise" (p. 58). The note cites the Biur on Exod. 12:24, "And you shall observe this matter as a statute for you and your children forever." The reader, perplexed by the peculiar phrase "gift of blood," who turns to the Biur ad loc. will find the following: "This refers to the paschal lamb mentioned earlier (12:21), not to the placing of the blood (mattan damim) [on the lintel and the two doorposts], for they [the Israelites] were commanded to observe this matter [the placing of the blood] only on the Passover of [the Exodus from] Egypt." Furthermore, Mendelssohn here is citing almost verbatim the commentary of Nahmanides, who in turn based himself on the Mishnah (Pesahim 96a). Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment serves to underscore the caveat that scholars in the area of modem Jewish thought who wish to deal with its classical and medieval sources must be able to handle this difficult and knotty material properly.
