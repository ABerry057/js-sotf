Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994. 361 pp. Monty Noam Penkower, author of The Jews Were Expendable: Free World Diplomacy and the Holocaust, has assembled in a single volume essays exploring the relationship between the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel. This collection juxtaposes America's pallid policies which purportedly aimed at the wartime rescue of Jews with proposals put forward by American Jewish organizations and Zionist leaders in Palestine. Penkower writes from the perspective of someone well versed in both Jewish tradition and the historical record. Theologically, Israel's sovereign status is described in traditional liturgy as the dawn of Jewish redemption, and Penkower's most fundamental claim is that the historical record shows how extermination and rebirth are linked. This is a book with both disciplinary rigor and personal passion, and Penkower should be commended for accommodating both moral imperative and academic standards.</page><page sequence="2">220 BOOK REVIEWS By focusing on influential Jewish leaders, many of the essays in this volume analyze the several unsuccessful attempts to convince American statesmen and politicians to direct diplomacy and battle lines toward saving Jewish lives. What Penkower describes is a process in which the Roosevelt administration reluctantly conceded the need for strong action on behalf of an increasingly desperate European Jewry but produced only counterfeit initiatives geared primarily to the demands of electoral politics; Roosevelt and his closest advisors had no intention of forging an effective rescue policy. The opposition of some of the major Jewish organizations to the idea of a Jewish state-most significantly, the American Jewish Committee-helped the administration maintain its ambivalence on rescue efforts and its wide popularity among Jewish voters. As Penkower notes, America's promises were hedged from the beginning by other considerations: The [American] government's policy reflected the response of the Roosevelt administration to the Holocaust. Its contemplated joint Anglo-American state- ment, intended since 1942 to stifle discussion on Palestine, paralleled the democracies' silence about rescue in general. A persistent position explains the refusal to challenge the British White Paper at the 1943 Bermuda Conference, to support the opening of North Africa and Libya for the large-scale admission of Jews, or to favor temporary havens in Palestine. Thus, too, the War Department and then State directly interceded to halt certain passage of congressional resolutions, rooted in the tragedy of the Holocaust, which favored Zionist objectives in the spring and winter of 1944. (pp. 227-228) Although the sad story of America's wartime policies on Jewish rescue seems to sound a single theme, the details of how the ethically driven proposals were blocked or rendered ineffective prove to be both diverse and instructive. Penkower does not overlook a meeting or a memo. The result is a fine-grained history of vulnerability but not of powerlessness. For out of the context of annihilation, Penkower argues, Jews built a framework for cultural renewal and political development. Without a state of their own, Jews did not fit into the modem world, according to Penkower, thereby enabling Nazism's ruthless, devastating assault to be turned into a machine for genocide. From the perspective of the international balance of power, Jews were simply refugees constituting a potential threat to the bureaucratic management of the war or to mobilization efforts. Hence, the commitment of those who survived the war to live in Palestine was not accidental; it was the logical result of an experience where</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 221 their status as humans could be so totally and universally compromised by their identity as Jews. Those who advocated that the world's democracies direct their resources to saving Jews never had a realistic chance of success against a well-entrenched structure of political and economic interests that might very well be forced to confront its own insensitivities and comfortable biases if pressed into service for the Jewish cause. But the nexus between massive destruction and creative, if not also costly and painful renewal, was no simple calculation of political power; it was also a function of biography. In one of the book's most imaginative and provocative chapters, an essay on Rabbi Leo Jung, Penkower probes the position of non-Zionist Orthodoxy (Agudath Israel) in the years before the outbreak of World War II. He demonstrates how frightened many Torah sages were about moving from the European yeshiva world to either modern, godless America or to a Palestine dominated by secular Zionism. A self-confidence born of a rich secular as well as religious education enabled the late Rabbi Jung to envision Jewish interests beyond ideological parameters and to convince many that Orthodoxy could survive the challenge of modernity and flourish in the context of Jewish sovereignty. Thus, Penkower's methodological message is both powerful and clear: if tackling issues raised by historical events is important, one vital way to understand and write history is through the humans who participated in making it.
