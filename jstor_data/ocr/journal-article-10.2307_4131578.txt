Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press for the Ukrainian Research Institute and Center for Jewish Studies, Harvard University, 1999. xix, 255 pp. Henry Abramson has chosen an appropriately ambiguous title for his study of the short-lived alliance between Ukrainian and Jewish nationalists, a rap- prochement which owed both its hopeful beginning and its violent end to the fate of Ukrainian independence in the crucible of war and revolution that brought down the tsarist empire. Revising the pogrom paradigm prevalent in much of the schol- arship on Ukrainian-Jewish relations, Abramson argues that following the fall of the Romanovs leaders of Jewish parties justifiably invested their hopes for civic and political emancipation in the autonomous regional government of the Ukrain- ian Rada, formed in 1917 under the liberal auspices of Russia's newly established Provisional Government. Ironically, the dream died a brutal death in the course of its own realization. The Russian withdrawal under the terms of the treaty of Brest- Litovsk opened a window of opportunity for the fulfillment of Ukrainian national 157</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review aspirations. The ensuing period between the German withdrawal and the defeat of the Ukrainian National Republic by the Bolsheviks saw the transfer of power to a conservative regime, increasingly beleaguered by the chaos of Civil War, socio- economic dislocation, and the excesses of local Cossack rule. In the duration of the short and troubled existence of the Republic, its new government, headed by Symon Petliura, a man whose name still carries its association with Ukrainian anti- semitism, proved unable to exercise effective control over the violence raging throughout the former Pale of Settlement. Using new archival evidence, Abramson shows that Jews in Petliura's Ukraine had less to fear from the government than from a lack thereof. In a situa- tion of almost total anarchy, contemporary Jews-unlike their conspiracy-minded descendants-associated the attainment of Ukrainian independence with the fate- ful absence of law and order rather than with an ideologically motivated and cen- trally planned program of mass murder carried out by Petliura's willing execu- tioners. In 1917, Jews had every reason to pray for the fledgling government of a newly autonomous Ukraine. By 1919, they would find themselves directing their prayers for protection to a successor state which could hardly guarantee life and limb, let alone ensure the civic and political equality of its Jewish constituency. Stressing the links between the politics of the Jewish-Ukrainian honeymoon of 1917 and the catastrophic turn of events in 1919, Abramson dislodges anti- semitism from its pride of place in the oft-recounted tale of the Ukrainian peasant as the perpetrator and the Jewish townsman as the victim of a self-perpetuating and unrelenting wave of pogroms. Abramson attempts instead to tell a different story, one in which the Ukrainian and the Jewish versions of an emblematic his- torical moment are inextricably intertwined. For Abramson, the rapid political mo- bilization of the shtetl-the proverbial sleepy backwater of Jewish Eastern Eu- rope-marked an important moment in the democratization of Ukrainian national politics and in the "Ukrainization" of the Jews, a process cut short by the exigen- cies of war and the radicalization of nationalism from below. In his most com- pelling chapter, devoted to a painstaking assessment of the character and scope of pogrom violence, Abramson carefully distinguishes between pogrom rhetoric- almost exclusively political and aimed entirely at the "Jew-Bolshevik"-and the nature of the attacks. Motivated by the desire for plunder and often directed at non- Jewish communities that lay directly in the path of destruction, most pogroms were rooted in the particular pressures of local front-line conditions rather than in the malicious designs of Petliura and his government. Abramson's impressive command of Ukrainian and Jewish sources lends it- self to a critical shift toward the understanding of modem ethnic conflict as a rad- ically contingent phenomenon rather than an escalation of venerable "historic ha- treds." However, the conceptual framework of the argument strains the reader's capacity to appreciate the nuance and detail that went into the making of this po- tentially groundbreaking study. The introductory chapter opens with a slice-of-life description of "Ukrainian" Jewish culture which seems to float in a kind of socio- logical haze. A breathless survey of Jewish politics follows, as if from nowhere. Evidence regarding linguistic orientation and economic structure remains similar- ly unintegrated into any larger claim that might contextualize the historical expe- 158</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews rience of so-called "Ukrainian" Jewry. This raises the most methodologically un- settling question left unanswered by Abramson's study: Before the Ukrainian rev- olution raised the stakes attendant on the assertion of national identity, what was Ukrainian about Ukrainian Jewry? Notwithstanding the influence of Ukrainian as- pect on Yiddish verb construction, Abramson's evidence for the existence of an en- during Ukrainian self-consciousness among the Jews who lived for centuries along the west bank of the Dnieper remains thin. Compromising his own position on the embrace of Ukrainian national aspirations as a dramatic break in the history of the region's Jewish political culture, Abramson foregrounds his thesis in categories of self-ascription, the stability of which his evidence thoroughly undermines. In fact, the book chronicles the failure of the Ukrainian revolution to transform the Jews of Ukraine-along with many of their non-Jewish neighbors-into Ukrainians. Abramson's trenchant analysis of the pogroms of 1919 renders the tragic conse- quences of this failure painfully clear. Olga Litvak Princeton University Princeton, New Jersey</page></plain_text>
