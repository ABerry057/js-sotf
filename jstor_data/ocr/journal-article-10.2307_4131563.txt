Cambridge: Cambridge Universi- ty Press, 1999. xv, 355 pp. As Robert P. Gordon's foreword explains, Michael Perry Weitzman's Syriac Version of the Old Testament was originally projected as the first of two volumes on the subject. One can only concur with Gordon that Dr. Weitzman's recent death is a great loss to the academic community as well as to family and friends. One is immediately struck by the presence of the "Old Testament" in the book's title. As explained in the Preface, the Syriac version of the Bible-known as the Peshitta-has historically been preserved and used exclusively within the eastern church tradition: thus Weitzman's use of "Old Testament" rather than "He- 123</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review brew Bible." However, the book's driving thesis is that the Peshitta was not origi- nally produced anywhere within the early Christian community. Instead, Weitzman posits, an isolated, non-Rabbinic Jewish community produced the Syriac trans- lation form a Hebrew Vorlage sometime before 200 CE; this community subse- quently converted to Christianity, thus introducing the Peshitta to the eastern church by which it was eventually adopted. After succinctly reviewing Peshitta research to date, Weitzman offers a fresh evaluation of the relationship of existing Syriac and Hebrew texts, all the while as- serting that a now-lost Hebrew text served as base for both the Peshitta and the Masoretic text. Chapter Three compares the Peshitta with those biblical versions with which it most frequently agrees. Chapter Four examines translation technique more closely by "grading" individual books of the Peshitta: Some exhibit a con- servative approach in their Syriac renderings of Hebrew words and phrases; some exhibit what Weitzman characterizes as a modern approach, primarily by appeal- ing to the Septuagint; still others reflect their translators' consultation of other pas- sages within the Peshitta itself. Thus, though the notion that multiple translators produced the Peshitta is nothing new, Weitzman refines the theory by suggesting that there was a school of translators "working on the same greater project." Chap- ters Five and Six address the book's core issues: Weitzman's arguments for the Peshitta 's Jewish origin, his suggestions concerning recovery of the Peshitta Urtext originally translated from the Hebrew, and the suggested historical background for the subsequent distribution of Peshitta manuscripts. Overall, this is an extraordinary volume: its premise is innovative, its re- search exhaustive, its organization thoughtful. Though Weitzman's arguments are persuasive throughout, there is ample and careful mention of scholars represent- ing other schools of thought. Above all, the book's approach is astoundingly com- prehensive for a volume of this size. The reader is not only presented with exam- ples from the entire Hebrew Bible to support Weitzman's theses, but also with painstaking reconstructions-both written and graphic-of the proposed rela- tionships among various biblical versions as well as among extant Peshitta manu- scripts. It is worth mentioning that this is the only book of its type available in En- glish. With all this in mind, it must be noted that the book presents the reader with one significant problem. Where parallel passages are given in two or more lan- guages or dialects-say, from the Masoretic text, the Peshitta, the Septuagint, and one of the Targumim-the presentation of the English translation is frustratingly inconsistent. Sometimes all the passages in question are translated into English; sometimes only the Syriac is treated, sometimes only the Hebrew or Greek, some- times none of them. This is no doubt due to the book's having reached proof stage only at Dr. Weitzman's death, and one trusts it will be ironed out in future editions. If one were to express any concern in terms of the book's content, it would be a concern occasioned from time to time by many a great scholar: namely, that the elegance of Weitzman's theories is occasionally allowed to overpower the evi- dence at hand. The most notable example of this is his discussion of theological "im- provements" early Syriac translators may have introduced to the proposed Hebrew 124</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Vorlage. Weitzman accurately identifies such themes as bodily resurrection and a personal Messiah-figure as being present in the Peshitta but absent in the Ma- soretic text. But then-having argued quite persuasively that the Peshitta of the Hebrew Bible did not originate in the Christian community-he reiterates on page 246 that the community in question "is of non-Rabbinic Jewish origin" and that its "translators seem to represent a closed community, estranged from the Jewish peo- ple as a whole." While this scenario is perfectly acceptable, one might just as eas- ily suggest that the nascent Christian movement itself was perceived as a non-Rab- binic Jewish sect by contemporary adversaries and adherents alike, and may have produced the Peshitta before the term "Christian" was widely used. These decidedly minor complaints aside, we have here a landmark volume whose value to Semitists (and other linguists), historians, and biblical scholars can- not be overestimated. It serves as powerful testimony to Dr. Weitzman's extraordi- nary abilities as scholar and writer. John David Brolley Hebrew Union College Cincinnati, Ohio</page></plain_text>
