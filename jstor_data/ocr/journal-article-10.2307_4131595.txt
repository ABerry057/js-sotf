Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 1999. vii, 326 pp. The Banality of Good and Evil, by David R. Blumenthal, a scholar/rabbi of Judaic Studies at Emory University, is a welcome addition to the understanding of good and evil. What makes this work unique is that Professor Blumenthal has been able to combine the research from social and experimental psychology, philoso- phy, education, literature on the Holocaust and rescuers during the Nazi era, and religious teachings from the Jewish tradition. In his fourteen chapters, Blumenthal manages to present a body of knowledge which is accessible not only to college-level students, but also to the general pub- lic. The first chapter deals with a Jewish-Nazi he knew who possessed rigidity, hatefulness, and dictatorial approaches in his relationship to others. In Chapter 2, he comprehensively reviews the study of altruism in the fields of social and ex- perimental psychology. Focusing on the Staub, the Milgram, and the Stanford prison experiments, Blumenthal illustrates hierarchical authority, which leads or- dinary people to commit extraordinary evil. In the Staub experiment, a task was as- signed to three groups; one group was permitted to leave the room, another was given no instruction about leaving the room, and the third was prohibited from 202</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews leaving the room. Cries of distress were then simulated in an adjacent room. In the experiment using children, the children followed authority in the no-instruction group and the group prohibited from leaving the room. However, when adults were the subjects, they followed authority only in the "prohibited" group, while the no- instruction and permitted-to-leave groups got involved in helping. Blumenthal maintains that authority can permit ethically correct behavior; that is, authority can function, as authority, to justify and permit pro-social, as well as evil, behavior to- ward one's fellow being. Focusing on Milgram's Yale experiment, he shows that hi- erarchical authority can lead people to commit acts of cruelty, as demonstrated by people's predisposition to obey authority. Blumenthal conducted an experiment in his own class in order to examine students' response to no authority or direction. He concluded that the students ex- pected authority and direction; without it there was some confusion, and some stu- dents even walked out. He gives other examples in hierarchical rule where some individuals help because they have learned caring norms from leaders and society, which encourage them to help. A number of examples are given from Dutch and Polish rescuers, where caring norms and the role of moral leaders prompted them to risk their lives on behalf of Jews. Blumenthal speaks about the importance of teaching and praxis. Teaching can have racial and authoritarian content, or caring in the pro-social behavior. Ad- ditionally, Blumenthal believes personal competence and commitment to intelli- gent moral judgement could help prevent immoral acts. He discusses the role of extensivity, proposed by the Oliners, to explain such traits as inclusiveness, attach- ment, connectedness, openness, acceptance, and diversity. These factors help fa- cilitate pro-social attitudes and behaviors. Blumenthal emphasizes the importance of childhood discipline and per- sonality development. Describing Alice Miller's book on authoritarian child- hood upbringing and obedience, he states that frequently children who are humil- iated and abused become good candidates as adults for authoritarian racist hate groups. He also discusses the Freudian notion of repression, idealization, identifi- cation with strong leaders, projection, displacement of aggression, scapegoating, xenophobia, and a rigid adherence to conventional values, which are building blocks of Nazism/fascism. Similarly, the modeling of goodness and caring im- prints itself into a kind of behavior that has been demonstrated in the rescue ac- tivity of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. In Chapters 6 and 7 Blumenthal addresses the valued-concept of pro-social life, which consists of commitment to intelligent moraljudgement, intellectualper- severance, moral strength, righteous anger, moral courage, love, compassion, re- spect, honor, devotion,friendship,justice, caring, inclusiveness, extensivity, bond- ing, attachment, empathy, critical consciousness, empowerment, and protest. These, he feels, can result in "manufacturing" goodness in society. Blumenthal sees a need to identify the authority that is demanding obedience as well as the authority that is demanding resistance; to establish contact with vic- tims; and to learn and listen to their suffering by making person-to-person contact with them and identifying one's feelings with theirs. 203</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review Another important contribution of this work is the voice of Jewish religious tradition and how it helps to understand and buttress social justice. Blumenthal thoroughly examines the relevant social processes such as justice, charity, com- passion, obligation to one's neighbor, and many others that come from centuries of Jewish moral and ethical teachings on the obligation that human beings have to- ward others. This book would have benefited from discussion of economic and political forces that frequently add to social instability, which in turn permit evil to arise and cause hurt to groups. For example, during times of high unemployment, im- migrants and foreigners are frequently blamed for lack ofjobs. In sum, Blumenthal's work has a twofold purpose. The first is to explain what conditions are associated with caring, social responsibility towards one's fellow human being, as well as what forces contribute to evil. The second is to identify teachings and moral precepts from the Jewish Tradition that could prevent the ba- nality of evil. The Banality of Good and Evil is an important book, appropriate in classes on theology, ethics, altruism, the study of the Holocaust, genocide, litera- ture, history, and Judaic studies, as well as for the general readership.
