<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM: A REAPPRAISAL by BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Introduction Abraham Miguel Cardoso was born to a crypto-Jewish family living in Rio Seco, Spain, in the year 1626. He left Spain with with his older brother Isaac in 1648.1 Abraham Cardoso has usually been discussed within the larger context of the Sabbatian movement, which he served as one of its major theoreticians.2 Until his death in 1706, Cardoso found himself almost constantly under attack by the rabbinical authorities in the cities where he 1. Yerushalmi 1971 offers a full-length study of Isaac Cardoso, who broke with his brother over the question of Sabbatai Zebi's status as Messiah. 2. By Cardoso's own testimony in a work dated to around 1700, he had written sixty "Treatises" (drushim), "scattered throughout all of the Diaspora" (Scholem 1974, p. 295). Scholem 1933, pp. 324-328, counted forty-six drushim (including several "letters") extant in manuscript form. Molho and Amarilio 1960 published several texts, including an important autobiographical letter, from a manuscript not known to Scholem in 1933.

He served for some time as the personal physician to the bey of Tripoli and later to the local potentate in Tunis. In the last decades of his life, after the death of Sabbatai Zebi, he engaged in bitter debates with other leading Sabbatians about the divinity of the Messiah. Cardoso rejected wholeheartedly what he saw as their adoption of a Christian messialogy.3 Gershom Scholem's analysis of Cardoso's theology as Gnostic has re- mained fundamentally unchallenged. Scholem saw in Cardoso's thinking the crystallization of what he believed was the latent antinomian Gnosticism within Kabbalah and especially within the later strata of the Zohar, and he pointed to Cardoso's likely acquaintance with Gnostic ideas, filtered through the Church Fathers (read during theological studies in Spain), as the most significant factor in precipitating this crystallization (see expecially Scholem 1980, pp. 333-334; Scholem 1971a, pp. 65-74; Scholem 1971c, pp. 104-107). It is time to open up the case of Abraham Miguel Cardoso once again. Within the last decade and a half, Moshe Idel, Robert Bonfil, David Ruderman, Yosef Kaplan, Richard Popkin, and other scholars have made significant contributions to the study of the social and intellectual life of European Jewry in the early modem period, often with special attention to the role of former crypto-Jews, among whom the Cardoso brothers, Abraham and Isaac, figure prominently.

(All translations of Cardoso's texts in this article are my own; I have chosen to offer extensive quotations because Cardoso's writings are so little known, and what has been published is often difficult to access.) Abraham Cardoso has been the subject of treatments by Graetz (1897, p. 4), Bernheimer (1927), Scholem (1980, pp. 324-334), and Liebes 1995b. Scholem 1974 contains a convenient collection of previously published editions of three Cardoso manuscripts, with introductions and notes. There are numerous references to Cardoso and a lengthy description of Cardoso's drush entitled Maggen 'Abraham in Scholem 1973, s.v. "Cardoso, Abraham Miguel" in the index, and esp. pp. 814-820, and further discussions can be found in Scholem 1971a and Scholem 1971c. There is a biographical entry in Scholem 1978, pp. 396-400. Other short treatments of Cardoso are found in Yerushalmi 1971, chap. 7; Kaplan 1989a, pp. 210-219; Carlebach 1990, pp. 98-104; Liebes 1993b, pp. 104-105; and Liebes 1995c. Cardoso's academic background and theology are treated in Yosha 1988. 3. This is the major argument advanced in the section of Cardoso's Drush Kinuim published in Scholem 1980, see esp. p. 345.</page><page sequence="3">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 65 Cardoso's theological speculations, has also been enriched in recent years, especially by the work of Moshe Idel and Elliot Wolfson. The new scholarship permits a reinterpretation of Cardoso within the context of the historical and intellectual currents of the day, reaching far beyond the Sabbatian movement. To view Cardoso as only a Sabbatian theologian suggests that his thinking had little or nothing to do with the broader theological and philosophical debates which lay at the center of early modem intellectual life, and this, I argue, is not the case. We also need to reevaluate Scholem's position that Cardoso was brought to his theological views by the latent force of antinomian Gnosticism within Kabbalah. Without addressing the controversial topic of whether Kabbalah indeed possessed a latent Gnostic tendency, and, if it did, what its origin was,4 let me offer some comments about Cardoso's alleged Gnosticism. I do not find the Gnostic label particularly useful for understanding Cardoso's theology, and in many ways it is simply misleading. First of all, the Gnostic label turns Cardoso's thinking into a kind of atavism, a resurgence of mythemes that had been more or less dormant within the Kabbalah. I will argue that Cardoso's thinking is far more a response to intellectual currents at work within his own day, such as fideism, rationalism, and the philosophizing Kabbalah reflected in the writings of men like R. Abraham Yagel and Abraham Herrera. Second, it is difficult to accept that Cardoso is a Gnostic simply on the basis of his distinction between the hidden First Cause and the God of revelation. Cardoso denies any role in salvation to the deus absconditus, the First Cause. He does not share in the Gnostic sense of alienation from the material cosmos, nor does he believe it to be the product of an evil god or demiurge. And even if certain themes in Cardoso's theology may resemble some found in Gnostic theology, we cannot conclude that this resemblance demonstrates that Gnosticism had any appeal for him. If Cardoso was familiar with Gnosticism, and I would grant that he was, it is likely that he would have seen it as one more example of the false track taken by ancient philosophers and the whole esoteric tradition represented by, for example, the Hermetic corpus, to which he does refer in some of his writings, precisely because it gives pride of place to the hidden First Cause. In order to set the stage for our reappraisal of Cardoso's theology, we need to rehearse briefly the major episodes in the early history of the Sabbatian 4. For a discussion of this topic, see Idel 1988, esp. pp. 30-32; Dan 1994; and Wolfson 1994, pp. 272-273.</page><page sequence="4">66 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK movement. We may begin our narrative on September 15, 1666, in the city of Adrianople. In the space of the preceding year, Sabbatai Zebi, self-declared Messiah, had swept up the Jewish world in the most widespread outbreak of eschatalogical fervor in its history. Now, arrested some time earlier by the Ottoman authorities on charges of libertinism and seditious proclamations (Scholem 1973, pp. 668-671) he is about to appear before the sultan for examination. Many of his followers had long believed that Sabbatai Zebi would one day enter the sultan's palace and emerge with at least permission to return to the Holy Land and rebuild the Temple. Here is how Nathan of Gaza, Sabbatai's "prophet," puts it in an epistle written in 1665: And now I shall disclose the course of events. A year and a few months from today, he [Sabbatai] will take the dominion from the Turkish king without war, for by the [power of] the hymns and praises which he shall utter, all nations shall submit to his rule. He will take the Turkish king alone to the countries which he will conquer, and all the kings shall be tributary unto him, but only the Turkish king will be his servant.5 When Sabbatai emerged from his meeting with the sultan, he had not compelled the sultan to become his servant. Instead, the Messiah had converted to Islam, although he continued to proclaim himself the now "occulted" Messiah of Israel. Some of those who wished to remain true to their belief that the messianic age had been inaugurated with Sabbatai Zebi decided to follow the lead of their Messiah and follow him into apostasy. Others took a more moderate course, considering Sabbatai Zebi's apostasy to be a unique act which was not intended to be a model for others. The most prominent spokesperson for this position was Abraham Miguel Cardoso. Scholem saw Cardoso's continued allegiance to Sabbatai Zebi as an example of the attraction which a "hidden" Messiah had on former crypto-Jews who themselves may have spent a considerable part of their lives in hiding their real identities (see especially Scholem 1971c, p. 95). For Cardoso, at least, the Messiah's apostasy was not an act which he sought to emulate. Cardoso set out to define the theory and practice of the Sabbatian faith by downplaying the apostasy and the image of a debased Messiah. Cardoso's Jewish triumphalist messiansim-he believed that Israel's redemption would 5. Quoted in Scholem 1973, pp. 272-273.</page><page sequence="5">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 67 mean the acknowledgment by both Christianity and Islam that their revelations were utterly without merit6--could not countenance the centrality of a debased Messiah, nor the practice of self-debasement through apostasy which some Sabbatians adopted in imitation of Sabbatai Zebi. Cardoso was fully aware of how closely the image of the debased Messiah resembled that of the Christian Messiah.7 Although he was not afraid to use the Suffering Servant passage in Isaiah 53 as a prooftext for the messianic status of the debased Sabbatai Zebi, he sought to distinguish Sabbatai Zebi's debasement from that of Jesus by claiming that Sabbatai Zebi would not die in a condition of debasement as Jesus had: "And we say that between the abasement and the glory of the Messiah son of David, there must be no death, for the Messiah son of David does not have to die" (from an unpublished manuscript of a letter of Abraham Cardoso to his brother, quoted in Yerushalmi 1971, p. 337). When in fact Sabbatai Zebi died in 1676 without having emerged in glory from his apostasy, Cardoso developed a theory about two Messiahs, one the descendant of David, the other the descendant of Ephraim. (The latter is also sometimes spoken of as the Messiah son of Joseph, Ephraim's father. Cardoso prefers the designation "Messiah son of Ephraim.") Cardoso identified the Messiah son of David with Sabbatai Zebi, and the Messiah son of Ephraim with himself.8 Cardoso uses the notion of two Messiahs, I will argue, to get beyond the focus on an apostasizing and humiliated Messiah. In the next section I will examine a text in which Cardoso's claim to be the Messiah son of Ephraim is the main focus of the discussion. Then, in the following sections, I will attempt to situate Cardoso within the intellectual topography of his day. I argue that the way Cardoso understands 6. In Ze 'eli ve- 'anvehu, p. 342, Cardoso explains that Muslims and Christians, and indeed Jews too since the close of the Talmud, have mistakenly been praying to the First Cause, a being without providential concern for humanity, rather than to the God of revelation, the God of the Torah. See also Scholem 1980 for Cardoso's fullest discussion of the derivation of Christian theology from corrupted Jewish traditions. 7. For a discussion of Abraham Cardoso's use of Christological motifs in his explication of the debasement of Sabbatai Zebi, see Yerushalmi 1971, pp. 335-341. 8. It is not as unusual as it may seem at first to make such a messianic claim or to make it made about someone. Some of R. Isaac Luria's disciples considered him to have been the Messiah son of Ephraim (Scholem 1973, pp. 54-55, 70), and the same was believed about R. Samson b. Pesah of Ostropol, who was martyred during the 1648 Ukrainian uprising (see Scholem 1973, p. 82; Liebes 1987, p. 244). A certain R. Nehemiah Cohen (!) claimed to be the Messiah son of Ephraim and even engaged in a debate with Sabbatai Zebi over this claim (Scholem 1973, pp. 658-668).</page><page sequence="6">68 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK his messianic role serves to position him against both the anti-Sabbatian rabbinic establishment as well as its many intellectual opponents, including certain philosophizing kabbalists and rationalist critics. Cardoso, I will argue, represents himself as an "anti-elitist" Messiah who will share the secrets of Israel's redemption-bearing knowledge with the whole Jewish people. I conclude by returning to Cardoso's messianic claims, and I offer an analysis of his teaching about the unity of the Messiah son of David and the Messiah son of Ephraim. Cardoso makes the two Messiahs into a single, powerful icon of redemption. This single icon is the image of the two Messiahs joined together as one. Cardoso is constructing a messianic icon which would carry the same force among the broad spectrum of Jews as the image of the unity of God and his Shekhinah carried for the elitist, mystical tradition of ecstatic Kabbalah. Just as the vision of this union brought the mystic into a transformed state, so the image or icon of the union of the two Messiahs would, Cardoso hoped, draw the entire Jewish people forward into redemption. The Messiah son of David and the Messiah son ofEphraim Cardoso's teaching about the Messiah downplayed the figure of Sabbatai Zebi as a model. Cardoso sought to avoid concentration on the apostasy as the culminating act of Sabbatai's messianic identity. Sabbatai Zebi, Cardoso believed, was the precursor to another messianic figure, one who would bring the drama of redemption to completion through the full explication of Sabbatai Zebi's teaching. Cardoso makes this clear in a treatise (drush) entitled "Israel was holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his harvest" (Jer. 2:3), which we will refer to hereafter as Qodesh Yisra 'el. This text mentions the death of Sabbatai Zebi (1676), and yet it reveals a heightened expectation of the cessation of Israel's exile (galut). In 'al ha-Hamarah be-Sa 'loniki ("On the Apostasy in Saloniki"), p. 278, Cardoso tells us that in 1680 he and his students began to look forward to an imminent end to the exile, and as Passover of the year 1682 approached, they had great hopes that the festival would not pass without the coming of redemption (p. 281). It is therefore reasonable to accept Scholem's dating of the text to sometime during this two-year period, and certainly before the mass apostasy of the Sabbatians in Saloniki in the year 1683, an event which devastated Cardoso and closed the book on his hopes for an imminent redemption (Scholem 1974, p. 249).</page><page sequence="7">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 69 In Qodesh Yisra 'el Cardoso plays with acronyms derived from the first and final letters of several biblical phrases, as well as of the phrases "Messiah son of David" and "Messiah son of Ephraim" (Mashiah ben David and Mashiah ben 'efraim, respectively). At one point Cardoso equates the sequence of Hebrew letters mem, bet, alef of "Messiah son of Ephraim" with that of "Michael son of Abraham," his own name. He goes on to declare that he possesses something like a divine nickname, r'oshiy, "my head," also the name of a sort of supernal alter-ego who appears to him as his spiritual "guide" (maggid). This nickname is fraught with kabbalistic significance. In the context in which Cardoso introduces the name, and in his further discussion of it, it is clear, as we will see below, that is is connected with the sefirah of Yesod, the divine phallus. Cardoso explains that the consonants of this name can be found in the first word of the Hebrew Bible, ber 'eshiyt, "In the beginning [of]." The first name of the Messiah son of David, Sabbatai (Shabtay), may also be found in this word, but one must rearrange the letters. In other words, Cardoso's nickname is written "in order" within the first word of the Bible, whereas Sabbatai Zebi's found "out of order." Cardoso explains why this should be so in a passage of tremendous significance for an understanding of his self-image. Consider that r 'oshiy is the head [r 'osh] of the tenth sefirah,9 and this pours out in a straight line upon Malkhut, 1o and for this reason the letters of r 'oshiy are in a straight line and clearly visible in the word ber 'eshiyt. Remaining over from the word are the letters b [bet] t [tav], and she [bat means "daughter"] is Malkhut. Because it [r 'oshiy] is from Yesod [the ninth sefirah, the divine phallus], it is a "speculum which shines," and its name shines in the light of the word ber 'eshiyt. And because the Messiah son of David is from Malkhut,"I and Malkhut is a "speculum which does not shine," his deeds are hidden and his name is not in order in the letters of the word ber 'eshiyt. And likewise at the end of the Torah, in the word Yisra 'el, r 'oshiy is found, but not in order, because he too [i.e., Cardoso] will come to be within Israel in a state of confusion. 9. I am accepting Scholem's suggested reading of l'"y for ly in the manuscript, taking the yod to represent the number 10 (Ben-Zvi and Benayahu 1960, p. 257). 10. This is the name for the tenth sefirah, sometimes referred to as Shekhinah, and thus r 'oshiy is both Cardoso's nickname and his special name for the ninth sefirah, Yesod, the divine phallus. 11. Cardoso bases this upon zoharic passages, and the fact that David, as king, is related to the sefirah whose name, Malkhut, means "kingdom."</page><page sequence="8">70 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK And there is yet another reason [for the arrangement of the messianic names in the word ber 'eshiyt]: according to the sages of blessed memory, "in the heels of the Messiah there will be an increase of effrontery, abuse, and scorn," and in the Tiqquney ha-Zohar and in the Zohar we read that the sages of this [messianic] generation-and this is it-will hate the wisdom of the Kabbalah completely, and they will cause a lengthening of the exile and its tribulations, and the light of [the sefirah] Hokhmah [wisdom] will withdraw upward from [the sefirah] Tiferet. Then the Messiah will be humbled and laid waste and dried up, and his spirit will leave and not return. Because of all this, the Messiah son of David will not be able to bring redemption and to explain the secret of the faith in the divinity with clarity and in all its details. Then the Messiah will sleep in the dust, and indeed he will become dust. And then the Messiah son of Ephraim, according to the reasons which I will explain, God willing, shall grasp hold of and declare the faith of the First Cause within the Holy One, blessed be He, and his Shekhinah and the faith of the divinity in all its details to Israel. For this reason, the name of the Messiah son of David is not in order in the word ber 'eshiyt, and the name of the Messiah son of Ephraim is in order there. (Qodesh Yisra'el, p. 258) Cardoso identifies himself as the Messiah son of Ephraim, a firgure whom he associates with Yesod, the divine phallus, within the configurations of the sefirot.12 Cardoso's divine nickname, r 'oshiy, is contained within the first word of the Hebrew Bible, ber 'eshiyt, and the letters which surround his name make up the word bat, "daughter," referring to the sefirah of Malkhut, aligned with the Messiah son of David, Sabbatai Zebi. Although we must return to this point later, it is important to note now how we have in this explication of the first word of the Hebrew Bible a representation of the penetration of the male sefirah of Yesod within the space of the female Malkhut, and at the same time the representation of the union of the two Messiahs. This union is, in fact, the focus of Cardoso's Qodesh Yisra 'el. What Cardoso wants to stress in the passage just quoted, however, is that he, Cardoso, is the "straight" version of the Messiah, whereas Sabbatai Zebi is the "out-of-order" version who requires Cardoso to offer a clearer, more legible, rendering of the Messiah's message concerning the "mystery of the faith."" 12. Liebes 1993a, p. 14 and passim points out that in the Idra Rabba, the Messiah is identified with the configuration of Yesod. 13. Although it is certainly anachronistic to read "heterosexual" in the use of the term "straight" by Cardoso, it is not imposing a foreign sense on the word if we see it as having</page><page sequence="9">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 71 Cardoso uses a second set of terms with which to contrast his messiahship with that of Sabbatai Zebi. He says that he, as the Messiah son of Ephraim, is like a "speculum which shines," whereas Sabbatai Zebi, the Messiah son of David, is like a "speculum which does not shine." These terms are standard kabbalistic nomenclature for the male potency within the sefirotic configurations (sometimes specified as Tiferet and sometimes as Yesod) and the sefirah of Malkhut or Shekhinah (Wolfson 1994, passim, and esp. pp. 306-317). They also distinguish between the level of revelation granted to Moses (through a "speculum which shines") and that granted to all other prophets (through a "speculum which does not shine"). Cardoso is therefore alluding to the superiority of his vision of the divine over that attained by Sabbatai Zebi. The contrast between this view of Sabbatai Zebi and that found in an early text of Cardoso's dealing with the meaning of Sabbatai Zebi's apostasy, Maggen 'Abraham, written in 1668 (Scholem 1973, p. 815), indicates clearly how the death of Sabbatai Zebi in 1676 forced Cardoso to rethink Sabbatai Zebi's messianic significance.14 In the earlier text Cardoso describes the reference to the erect phallus, which Cardoso explicitly describes as "pouring out" in a straight line upon Malkhut, an unmistakable kabbalistic reference to the seminal efflux of Yesod. Since, as a matter of fact, Cardoso claims that his power derives from Yesod, and that of Sabbatai Zebi from the female Malkhut, perhaps it is not inappropriate to understand Cardoso to be reinforcing the heterosexuality of his "union" with Sabbatai Zebi and, thus, his "straightness." I will return in a later section of the paper ("Cardoso as Kabbalist and the Unity of the Messiahs") to the theme of the sexual juncture of Cardoso qua Messiah son of Ephraim and Sabbatai Zebi qua Messiah son of David. It will become clear that there are homoerotic elements in this theme, but I would caution strongly against concluding that Cardoso was a homosexual. I am persuaded by recent scholarship which challenges the notion that homosexuality refers to a single transhistorical psychic disposition. (For a recent summation of the position, and special remarks about the construction of sexuality in rabbinic culture, see Boyarin 1997, esp. pp. 14-23.) On the other hand, I will argue that Cardoso is not merely replaying the homoerotic themes which are so basic to the Kabbalah (see Wolfson 1994, esp. pp. 369-377). I will argue that these themes also serve what I call Cardoso's phallic narcissism. This psychosocial dynamic, very much a feature of Cardoso's crypto-Jewish history, will be the subject of a much longer treatment in a future book-length study on which I am currently engaged, and is broached in this paper in "Cardoso as Kabbalist and the Unity of the Messiahs." 14. If, however, we agree with Liebes (1995b, pp. 46-48) that this text is not in fact by Cardoso, we may see greater continuity in Cardoso's thinking. I tend to accept Liebes's rejection of Scholem's attribution of the text to Cardoso, but nothing in my argument hinges on the resolution of this question.</page><page sequence="10">72 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK incomprehensibility of Sabbatai Zebi's actions as a sign of their origin in a higher wisdom vouchsafed only to the Messiah son of David, the King Messiah. Now we must make clear that no creature is able to grasp with knowledge the affairs of the King Messiah because his knowledge is greater and higher than that of all who have ever passed through the world or who ever will, whether in purity or its opposite [i.e., whether members of Israel or not]. And this is what the sages hinted at in saying [TB San83b] that the Holy One, blessed be He, would lay upon the Messiah commandments as a heavy burden which enjoin upon him strange things which will be done by the King Messiah to the point that they will appear strange in the eyes of all the world. Indeed, because they are established as a remedy for their own heavy burdens, the deeds which are strange in the eyes of all people are heavy [for the King Messiah]. There is no one who is able to comprehend them in any way or manner because they are profoundly hidden acts of reparation [tiqqunim] ... (Maggen 'Abraham, p. 137) After the death of Sabbatai Zebi, Cardoso reinterpreted the incomprehen- sibility of his actions as a test of faith for Israel, a stage in Israel's path to knowledge from out the blindness of its faith. I see this reconceptualization of the strange deeds of the Messiah as springing from Cardoso's desire to present an image of a Messiah without the taint of debasement, even if it means presenting another Messiah, the Messiah son of Ephraim, as the one who fulfills what Sabbati Zebi began. Faith vs. Knowledge In 'iggeret le-Dayyaney 'izmir ("A Letter to the Rabbinate of Smyrna"), written not long after Sabbatai Zebi's apostasy (May-June 1669; see Scholem 1974), Cardoso invokes the same distinction between two levels of revelation that we have seen him draw in the later text Qodesh Yisra 'el. In the earlier text, this distinction corresponds not to the Messiah son of David and the Messiah son of Ephraim respectively, but to the levels of faith ('emunah) and knowledge (yedi 'ah). It is interesting to observe that before the death of Sabbatai Zebi, Cardoso is using the same conceptual tools as he employs after Sabbatai Zebi's death, and in both cases the aim is to downplay the status of the debased Messiah. In the earlier text, Cardoso begins his reflection on the</page><page sequence="11">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 73 difference between faith and knowledge by commenting on the passage in the book of Exodus where Moses, having been commanded by God to instruct Pharaoh to release the Israelites from their bondage, asks God to release him from the mission. And the reason was not that he was afraid of Pharaoh, or of the Egyptians, but the core of his reasoning is found in his statement that the Israelites will not believe in him. But the question arises what value such belief or lack of belief in him has, if the exodus is the effect [of a chain of events, beginning with] Pharaoh's choice, then the conflict with Moses, then the battle with Pharaoh, and at the very end of it all, without their willing it, Israel will leave Egypt. But Moses knew that the promise of salvation would not be fulfilled easily, but with great tribulations and with immense trouble, if the belief in what was promised was lacking. Because of this he [Moses] was afraid neither of the sword of Pharaoh nor of any other danger except for the danger posed by those who lacked faith, lest Israel not believe in him. And in exactly the same way the second redeemer [Sabbatai Zebi] requires faith according to the secret teaching regarding the verse "righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and faithfulness ['emunah] the girdle of his loins" [Isaiah 11:5, RSV translation].'5 What this means is that just as a girdle strengthens the loins of the one whom it girds, so faith increases the strength of the redeemer. Another reason is that the one who believes in him is joined to him in just the way a girdle is joined to the loins of a man. And the secret teaching is this: the redeeming angel is [the sefirah of] Malkhut, and also the Messiah is called Malkhut. And it is evident from the Zohar and the Tiqqunim that the one who establishes the kingdom of the house of David on the earth requires the efflux of the higher levels, and [the sefirah of] Malkhut Qadishah is called faith ['emunah] and also "the speculum which does not shine." And so long as he [the Davidic Messiah] lacks the power to shine as does the "speculum which shines," which is the Torah as it is issued forth through prophetic power like the light of the sun, but he only shines as in a diminished vision, then for so long faith is required. For if faith were to shine like the sun it would not be faith but knowledge. ('iggeret le-Dayyaney 'izmir, pp. 314-3 15) 15. This verse is from a chapter containing one of the most famous messianic prophecies in the Hebrew Bible, and it seems to have been taken up in the Idra Rabba in reference to the "girding of the weapons" by the "righteous," i.e., the kabbalistic brotherhood which has attained messianic powers through its mystical practices. For a discussion of this motif, see Liebes 1993a, 21-22.</page><page sequence="12">74 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Cardoso argues that Sabbatai Zebi is the Messiah in whom one must have faith, and, what is more, in whom one can only have faith, precisely because he seems to do what no Jewish Messiah would ever do, namely, apostasize, and because he is a debased figure rather than a glorious king. What is more, the completion of Sabbatai Zebi's messianic task requires that Israel place its faith in him. Without such faith, his redemptive power is curtailed. But such faith is only a preparatory stage in Israel's redemption. The Jewish people must pass through this test of faith before they can enter into the full light of knowledge. Just a little further on Cardoso states: "Faith is a speculum which does not shine, and knowledge is a speculum which does shine, and someone who wishes to ascend to knowledge must enter through the door of faith, because this is the gate of the Lord" (p. 315).16 As we have just seen, Cardoso will later argue that the Messiah Son of Ephraim is the Messiah of Knowledge, the Messiah who will explicate for the Jewish people the true nature of God. When Cardoso speaks of faith as the "speculum which does not shine," he is, first of all, ranking the epistemological status of faith below that of knowledge, in the same relative position as "diminished vision" stands to "the light of the sun." The level of faith is a level which must be transcended if the knowledge of God, the clear and direct vision, "in the light of the sun," through "the speculum which shines," is to be attained."7 The centrality of the knowledge of God for Israel's redemption, and, indeed, humankind's, is a theme to which Cardoso returns frequently in many of his writings. Here is the opening of his treatise Zeh 'eli ve-'anvehu ("This Is My God and I Will Extol Him," Exod 15:2), written one or two years after the mass apostasy in Saloniki, in either 1684 or 1685: It is widely acknowledged that Adam was created with intelligence and free will so as to worship his Creator, but it is not possible to worship a being in 16. Cardoso is here alluding to the opening of Tiqquney ha-Zohar, which contains extended interpretations of the first verse of the Hebrew Bible, and speaks of Shekhinah as the "gate of the Lord." Tiqquney ha-Zohar is clearly also central for Cardoso's Qodesh Yisra 'el, a text I will discuss below in "Cardoso as Kabbalist and Unity of the Messiahs." 17. If we agree with the arguments advanced in Liebes 1995b that Cardoso is the author of the major theoretical work Raza de-Mehemnuta which he himself and the later tradition ascribed to Sabbatai Zebi, we may find Cardoso's justification for this act of"ghostwriting" to lie in his belief that he is the divinely appointed explicator of the "meaning" of Sabbatai Zebi to the world. Cf. Liebes 1995b, p. 44, who rightly suggests that "perhaps Cardoso did not see his act as total forgery."</page><page sequence="13">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 75 truth when that being's reality is not known. In order that Adam might govern his life with wisdom, the Creator graced Adam with a knowledge ready to grasp His divinity. But this was not sufficient, and therefore He declared His reality to Israel through His servant Moses, "faithful in [all] his house," and He gave Israel the Torah and its interpretation in order that Israel might worship Him in perfection in accordance with what is written in the Torah. And He did not want them to only believe in Him, but to recognize Him and to know His truth by means offundamental principles rooted in wisdom, discernment and knowledge. He wanted Israel's knowledge to be. unshakable, and, indeed, that was a generation of knowledge, as it is written: "To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him"; ". ..know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that the Lord is God in heaven above and on earth beneath; there is no other"; ". . .and I will take you for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord" [Deut 4:35, 4:39; Exod 6:7, RSV translation]. Therefore the essence of the entire Torah is "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt," and the interpretation of this is: in order to know that the Lord exists. This is the first commandment which it is incumbent upon a man to fulfill with his intelligence, and thus David commanded his son Solomon, "Know the God of your father and worship him"... (Zeh 'eli ve- 'anvehu, p. 335; emphasis added) Again, in 'iggeret Gimmel, a letter written to his disciples in the year 1701, nearly twenty years after the preceding text, we read: God, may He be blessed, does not desire that people have faith in him like fools,'" but that people have discernment and know in truth and with wisdom His divinity, as it is written, ". .. and you shall know that I am the Lord," "to you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord is God." And the instruction which they [Israel] received from Moses our teacher was not so that they might have faith but so that they might have knowledge. ('Iggeret Gimmel, p. 193) Almost immediately after this passage, Cardoso returns to what we have seen is one of his fundamental motifs. 18. We may certainly see in this expression a reference to Prov 14:15, "A fool will believe everything," but I think it is not going too far to read in it also a reference to Erasmus' In Praise of Folly. We shall see below that Cardoso was most likely conversant with the theological position known as fideism, and Erasmus' work was one of the most famous defenses of this position.</page><page sequence="14">76 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK ..faith ['emunah] is a speculum which does not shine, a beautiful maiden with no eyes, but the righteous one is a head and a speculum which shines with the attribute of wisdom. And the wise man has eyes in his head to seek the way of divinity with intellectual wonders and visions. ('Iggeret Gimmel, p. 193) This last passage is particularly significant because we see Cardoso again calling upon a series of associations linking faith, the speculum which does not shine, and the Shekhinah ("the beautiful maiden without eyes") and also connecting knowledge, speculum which shines, and head (r'osh), which is connected with the sefirah of Yesod, the divine phallus.'9 These are the very associative links which are central to the Qodesh Yisra'el, written nearly twenty years before, in which Cardoso makes his most explicit claim to be the Messiah son of Ephraim. Cardoso, it is true, seems not to want to proclaim himself a messianic figure in his later writings,20 but despite this reluctance he continues to insist that he, and he alone, is completing the drama of redemption by bringing to all Israel the full knowledge of the mystery of divinity. In another letter to his disciples also written in 1701 (Molho and Amarillo 1960, 19. For the identification of the head with opened eyes and Yesod, see Wolfson 1994, pp. 355-383, and Wolfson 1995a. I note in passing that Cardoso in this passage may be influenced by the very text quoted in Wolfson 1995b, p. 112, in which "the beautiful maiden without eyes" is invoked in relation to the Shema' since Cardoso too had just been discussing the proper ritual performance of this liturgy. 20. He denies that he had made any claim of messiahship about himself in 'ani Mekhuneh, p. 127, a late autobiographical text, but this passage must be understood in its context. Cardoso is discussing how he acquired his knowledge of the nature of the divinity of Israel's God, and he refers to the talmudic dictum that only four men "know God innately [me- 'azmo]," namely Abraham, Job, Hezekiah, and the King Messiah. This dictum is used by Cardoso in one of his earliest writings, Maggen 'Abraham, p. 138, as well as in the later autobiographical writings like 'ani Mekhuneh, p. 127, and 'iggeret Gimmel, p. 198, always in reference to Sabbatai Zebi. What Cardoso seems to be saying is that Sabbatai Zebi "knew God innately," but that he, Cardoso, was given the power to know God from an "illuminated" reading of the Torah, aggadot, and Kabbalah, and therefore he is not the King Messiah. I would take this to be Cardoso's way of seeming to distance himself from a claim to be Messiah, but what it really says is that he, Cardoso, has a higher grade of knowledge than Sabbatai Zebi. Cardoso dispenses with the messianic title and pays an "underhanded compliment"to the figure who retains it. Whether he claims a messianic title or not, he continues to claim a messianic function. (See also the polemical tractate Sefer Maribat Kadesh, p. 18, in Freimann 1912 for another use of the "innate knowledge" motif by Cardoso, where he clearly states that this applies only to the Messiah son of David, but that the Messiah son of David and the Messiah son of Ephraim "have a single mystery which is shared by them.")</page><page sequence="15">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 77 p. 233), Cardoso writes: "You see, and the majority of the Diaspora knows, that I alone am revealing the divinity of the Holy One, blessed be He, in wisdom, discernment and knowledge." It is clear that, whether as Messiah son of Ephraim or not, Cardoso sees himself as the one who is lifting Israel from faith to knowledge. Cardoso's distinction between the levels of faith and knowledge is typical of seventeenth-century thought. It reveals a great deal about his position within the intellectual topography of his day. We see that Cardoso is no stranger to one of the basic concerns of the age, namely, the quest for a new epistemic grounding for the faith claims of religion, a consequence of what Popkin (1979) has called "the intellectual crisis of the Reformation." In response to Luther's proclamation at the Diet of Worms in 1521 that he would accept only "what the conscience is compelled to believe on reading Scripture" (Popkin 1979, p. 3) as the criterion of religious knowledge, some Catholic theologians had adopted a fideistic defense of the authority of the Church in distinguishing true from false doctrine. This fideistic defense was linked to a skeptical attack upon all extra-ecclesiastical claims to knowledge, whether based on conscience, sense-perception, reason, or some combination of these (Popkin 1979, esp. chap. 4). The fideist argued that only ecclesiastical authority could provide a secure criterion of true doctrine, since all other bases of knowledge were inherently fallible. One had, therefore, to make faith in ecclesiastical tradition the foundation of one's religious life, according to the fideist. Cardoso's denigration of faith in favor of knowledge stands opposed to Catholic Counter-Reformation fideism, with which he may have been familiar from his theological training in Spain. While Cardoso does not claim that the sole criterion of religious knowledge is the inner certitude of conscience, he does ascribe a power to recognize religious truth "innately" to Sabbatai Zebi (see above, n. 19.) And Cardoso's use of Scripture-for him this would include both the written and the oral Torah, including the zoharic corpus-against his anti-Sabbatian critics resembles Luther's stand. We may see this more clearly if we look at how fideism functioned within inner-Jewish polemics. Fideism had become a staple for many Jews in their argument with the rationalist critics of the scriptural and rabbinic traditions. Yosef Kaplan (1989a, pp. 316-318) discusses the use which Isaac Orobio de Castro makes of fideistic skepticism in rebutting the arguments of Juan de Prado and, as well, of the Remonstrant theologian Philip van Limborch. Orobio, Kaplan</page><page sequence="16">78 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK writes, argued that without faith in the Scripture and in the Oral Law by which it is appropriately interpreted, "there is no possibility of obtaining knowledge of the Godhead" (1989a, p. 317). "Orobio goes so far as to say," Kaplan adds in a note (1989a, n. 39, p. 317), "that since the cessation of prophecy in Israel the Jewish people have lost all certain knowledge of matters esoteric, and of the mystic quality of Scripture." Cardoso knew the work of Isaac Orobio, and in one letter he describes him, and his own brother Isaac as well, as "arrogant" in their rejection of those aspects of scripture and rabbinic tradition which smacked of the mystical and esoteric.2 In his opposition to the fideistic position of Orobio, Cardoso enunciates a claim about the possibility of religious knowledge which stands on the level of the "speculum which shines" and is, therefore, equal to that attained by Moses. This is, to be sure, a conception of religious knowledge which has its roots in the Kabbalah, but it also has parallels in Reformation theologians like Luther and Calvin who argued for the possibility of a Divine Illumination by which the individual could know the truth of Scripture. I am not claiming that Cardoso was familiar with the writings of Protestant theologians. However, I think the comparison is heuristically useful. It permits us to appreciate how Cardoso's dispute with Orobio and his denigration of faith in favor of knowledge reveals the conflict between his own reforming "back to scriptural revelation" position and the fideistic defense adopted by many Jewish traditionalists.22 One point must be made very clearly, however, in interpreting Cardoso's anti-fideistic position. In maintaining the primacy of knowledge over faith, Cardoso should not be seen as aligning himself with another group who opposed the fideists, namely, the anti-skeptical rationalists who claimed to possess ways of justifying the fundamental tenets of faith through rational demonstration.23 Cardoso, as we will see later, is vehemently opposed to the 21. I am following here the argument of Kaplan 1989a, pp. 215-216, that Cardoso does not place Orobio and his brother Isaac in the category of naturalistas, or rationalist deists, as Yerushalmi 1971, p. 326, first proposed. 22. We see the same conflict played out in the dispute between certain Jews who reject rabbinic authority and appeal to the Karaite tradition as they understand it, and the defenders of the Oral Law. See Rosenberg 1987 and Kaplan 1990. Rosenberg 1987 speaks of the Karaites as possessing a Protestant temper, and he aligns Cardoso with this group because, while Cardoso does not attack the talmudic rabbis, he opposes "the rabbinic tradition and calls for a return to the original sources of the relgion" (p. 295). 23. For a discussion of such rationalist defenses of faith, see Kors 1993.</page><page sequence="17">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 79 rationalist agenda of grounding religious faith upon what Limborch, in his dispute with Orobio, described as the "common and direct use of reason [communis et recta ratio] which is shared by everyone, whether Christian, Jew, or Gentile" (Kaplan 1989a, p. 318). When Cardoso calls knowledge the "speculum which shines," he is not speaking about a knowledge acquired through the exercise of rational investigation (scientia), but about knowledge as a higher sapientia.24 For Cardoso, knowledge is beyond faith because it is the revelatory medium of a resplendent vision of the divine realm, whereas faith provides only a dim apprehension of this realm, as in a "speculum which does not shine." Knowledge in the sense of sapientia has nothing to do with rational proofs for the existence of God. Sapientia does not justify faith, it consummates it. The Jewish thinker whose conception of religious knowledge stands closest to Cardoso's is R. Judah Loew, the Maharal of Prague. Both Cardoso and the Maharal are heirs of the anti-rationalist tradition in Jewish thinking which descends from R. Judah Halevi. David Ruderman (1995, pp. 95-97) has suggested that the Maharal may have been influenced by Protestant theology, and we have seen that Cardoso, even if we deny his familiarity with Protestant writings, replays the "reformer" position in his polemic with Isaac Orobio. In his analysis of the Maharal's "mystical theology," Sherwin (1982), first of all, stresses the Maharal's rejection of the search for a rational demonstration of the basic tenets of the Jewish faith, including the existence of God (p. 56), and the consequent need to rely upon the knowledge of God and his essence provided by kabbalistic tradition (pp. 61-69). Cardoso and the Maharal share a conception of Kabbalah, taken to be the "soul" of the Torah, as the sapiential consummation of faith (pp. 77-82). And like the Maharal, Cardoso believed that most rabbinical leaders were standing in the way of Israel's achievement of the higher sapience which would bring the end of the exile (galut). We will return to this point later, but for the moment it is sufficient to recognize the affinity between the two thinkers, the Maharal and Cardoso, who positioned themselves as "reformers," each raising a battle cry for a return to the authentic legitimating source of Jewish faith, the "illuminated" interpretation of Scripture provided by Kabbalah. 24. I am using the terms employed by Ruderman 1995, p. 97, in his discussion of the epistemology of the Mahral. In what follows I will argue that the Maharal offers us an earlier and somewhat more explicitly formulated dichotomization of faith and knowledge which can help us understand Cardoso's position better.</page><page sequence="18">80 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Cardoso and "Prisca Theologia " The intellectual topography of seventeenth-century Jewry is very com- plicated, and frequently borders are ill-defined. It is necessary to demarcate Cardoso's views about religious knowledge in relation to the views of a group of Jewish thinkers who also sought a higher sapience and advocated a return to the authentic legitimating source of Jewish faith in Kabbalah. I am referring to individuals like Abraham Yagel, Abraham Herrera, and Joseph Delmedigo. However dissimilar their modes of expression, each of these men believed that the Kabbalah offered access to a prisca theologia, or "ancient theology," which contained the highest revealed wisdom of humanity and had either been forgotten or corrupted during the intervening centuries. The concept of a forgotten prisca theologia begins with Renaissance humanists like Ficino and Pico della Mirandola who seek to harmonize scriptural revelation with pagan wisdom. They propose that there exists a knowledge of the nature of God which predates scriptural revelation, and which can be discovered in the writings of pagan philosophers, especially Plato and the Neoplatonists, and in pagan mystical texts like the Hermetic corpus. Scriptural revelation does not overturn pagan philosophy; it fulfills it. This "universalist" idea of revelation was a weapon in the arsenal of Renaissance humanists against the medieval Christian tradition, which was itself built upon the repudiation of pagan wisdom in favor of the unique authority of scriptural revelation. The notion of prisca theologia challenged Church authority and opened the door to an interest in pre-Christian texts under cover of a search for the antecedents to scriptural revelation. In its development among Jewish intellectuals in the Italy of the Re- naissance and the Counter-Reformation, the Kabbalah took a decidedly philosophical and universalist turn, as Idel has convincingly argued in a series of studies concerning the history of post-Expulsion kabbalistic thought (1987, 1992a, 1992b, 1992c). In this development, some Jews attempted to demonstrate that the authenticprisca theologia could be found in the Kabbalah, all of which is compatible with pagan philosophy, properly understood. The Kabbalah, then, is the universal body of knowledge whose teachings can be translated into the terms of, for example, Neoplatonism. We will see that Cardoso is familiar with some of these arguments, and rejects them wholeheartedly. But let us first briefly examine one instance of a Jewish defense of Kabbalah as prisca theologica, that of R. Abraham Yagel. I choose</page><page sequence="19">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 81 Yagel because this side of his thinking has received close attention from Ruderman (1988). Ruderman (p. 143) points out that Yagel felt that Jewish wisdom was most closely paralleled by the philosophy of Plato, who studied Torah with none other than the prophet Jeremiah (Yagel says he is following the testimony of Augustine on Plato's alleged dependence on Jewish learning). Although we see that Yagel places Jewish wisdom above pagan philosophy, the mere fact that pagan philosophy is introduced at all indicates a need to legitimize Jewish wisdom through external corroboration. Yagel at points is even willing to countenance pagan wisdom's equal stature with Judaism. "According to Yagel," Ruderman reports (p. 144), "Pythagoras deserves the same spiritual status as Plato. In discussing a rabbinic homily that, he claims, refers to the relationships between the ancient philosophers and their students, Yagel concludes: 'This clearly alludes to those philosophers who truly deserved that distinction [of being true philosophers], such as Plato, Pythagoras, and the ancients who were believers.' " In discussing the Jewish conception of God, Yagel also shows a willingness to demonstrate its universality. He bases his definition of God on the philosophically oriented teaching of Maimonides in the opening chapter of his Sefer ha-Madda ', and then employs extra-Judaic sources to corroborate biblical narrative. Yagel emphasizes the unity, indivisibility, incorporeality, and immutability of the Jewish conception of God. His innovation, however, is in demonstrating that fundamental religious principles regarding God can be substantiated by the testimony of external witnesses from the most unexpected source. The miracle of the parting of the Red Sea illustrates convincingly the notion of God's providence and ability to intervene in nature. Quoting a recent account of the discovery of Peru, Yagel is thrilled to find precise confirmation of the biblical miracle. (Ruderman 1988, p. 115) Ruderman (p. 148) summarizes Yagel's position succinctly, and concludes that, in his effort to harmonize and universalize Jewish wisdom, he laid the basis for its denigration. From Orpheus to Plato, there existed an unbroken tradition of pagan belief in monotheism, a chain of transmission parallel to but independent of that of "the holy seed of Abraham" who "saw the light of the Torah." No doubt Yagel could have easily located in rabbinic and medieval Jewish texts a fully</page><page sequence="20">82 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK developed attitude of tolerance and respect for "the righteous of the nations of the world." However, he appears to have extended that attitude beyond the usual understanding of tolerance within Jewish tradition. In recognizing an autonomous tradition of pagan belief in one God; in comparing pagan attitudes favorably with those of the rabbis; and in openly quoting, albeit in a carfully edited manner, the pagans themselves, even an entire prayer of Hermes, he implied that Judaism, despite its unadulterated tradition originating at Sinai, could not claim that its truths were either unique or exclusive. Ruderman clearly has located the essential problem with the Jewish appropriation of the notion of prisca theologia. It is bound to lead to the effacement of the uniqueness of Jewish revelation. It was clear to many rabbis who opposed the search for a prisca theologia that the consequence of this view was the blurring of the distinction between Christianity and Judaism, at least theologically. If Jewish and Christian thinkers were equating the theological heart of their respective scriptural revelations with one and the same third term--the prisca theologia-then both religions are really saying the same thing about the nature of God. So, many rabbis attacked the idea that, for example, the Zohar could be interpreted by means of Neoplatonic philosophy.25 R. Leon Modena accepted the idea that the Kabbalah could be harmonized with philosophy, but went on to argue that this showed the dependence of Kabbalah upon philosophy, and therefore its status as a late Jewish forgery passing itself off as revelation (see Idel 1987, pp. 150-157). R. Modena's aim in this anti-kabbalistic critique was to draw a sharp dividing line between Judaism and what he perceived to be extraneous elements within Jewish thought which threatened Israel's claim to a unique and superior revelation. There is a point of similarity between the philosophizing kabbalists and the anti-philosophical rabbinic establishment which needs to be drawn out before we can adequately understand Cardoso's position in this debate. Both groups conceive of themselves as an intelectual elite which holds the key to 25. For an informative treatment of how a philosophizing kabbalist and a traditionalist might on the surface appear to be strongly opposed to one another, while at a deeper level their positions reveal a shared concern to uphold rabbinic authority and fight "the dangerous excesses of kabbalistic enthusiasm" and "the loss of rational anchors of Jewish faith," see Ruderman 1995, chap. 7. I will argue that Cardoso opposed both the philosophizing kabbalists and traditionalists because they had each adopted a canon of rationality in matters of faith defined by pagan philosophy and had failed to maintain-allegiance to the God of revelation.</page><page sequence="21">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 83 a knowledge of God beyond the reach of most Jews.26 Yagel, for instance, begins his Beyt Ya 'ar Yisra 'el "by stressing the need for caution in revealing religious secrets to the untutored masses" (Ruderman 1988, p. 144). For Yagel, the Kabbalah is a means of transcending the segregation of Judaism from the broader cultural currents of the day, and he wants to protect the untutored masses of Jews from the dangers which such cultural rapprochement may bring. In the case of the more traditional rabbinic establishment, R. Leon Modena excepted, the Kabbalah was seen as the reository of a profound and technically complex wisdom whose meaning could only be fathomed after one had gained a full mastery of every other aspect of Jewish learning, from the written Torah to the Talmud and beyond. As Robert Bonfil has pointed out in his studies of Italian Jewry during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries (1990, 1992a, 1992b), this period saw a polorization between the Jewish intellectual elite and the general Jewish community, whose level of learning, including the knowledge of Hebrew, had declined significantly. "Polarization," Bonfil writes (1987, p. 60), "meant that, as against a small group of learned men, most of them rich or allied by marriage to rich families, there existed a great uneducated majority, incapable of participating in the debates of the scholars or even of understanding them."27 Cardoso was certainly, by training and knowledge, a member of that "small group of learned 26. The elitist proclivities of philosophically oriented Jewish thinkers was one of the major claims of Barzilay 1967, see esp. pp. 11-16. Barzilay's interpretation of anti-rationalist rabbis like R. 'Azariah Figo and R. Judah del Bene, whom he tends to see as opposed to the elitism of the rationalists, has come in for criticism by Bonfil 1992b and Ruderman 1995, pp. 185-212. In particular, Bonfil suggests that R. del Bene in his sermons sought to mediate between "high" (elitist) culture and "low" culture by tailoring his message in such a way that each group could feel itself to be the targeted addressee. Of course, a preacher like R. del Bene cannot be described as elitist in the same sense we might use this term to describe R. Yagel. R. del Bene, as Bonfil points out, was at pains to represent himself as standing in unbroken continuity with rabbinic tradition, without tincture of extrinsic, non-Jewish influence; on the other hand, R. Yagel was not afraid to acknowledge his pagan sources. But both men shared the assumption that the masses did not need, and in fact were imperiled by, the knowledge which they, and the few others like themselves, could alone properly employ. Cardoso's attitude stands in marked contrast to this, although, like R. del Bene, he seeks to represent himself as standing in unbroken continuinity with (authentic, not post-geonic rabbinic) Jewish tradition. 27. Bonfil's discussion of the role of Kabbalah in the process of modernization within Jewish society is extremely important for understanding the social dynamics of Sabbatian Kabbalah in general, and Cardoso's use of Kabbalah more particularly. This paper should be seen as laying the groundwork for a fuller appraisal of Bonfil's theory about the mediating role of Kabbalah. I would tentatively say that Sabbatian Kabbalah does, indeed, play a mediating role, only that it seeks to mediate between a wider public, including, for example, women,</page><page sequence="22">84 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK men." But he saw his mission to be the collapsing of the distinction between learned and uneducated, and it is in this context that we must understand his polemic with the philosophizing kabbalists and the traditional rabbinic establishment. I will elucidate the nature of Cardoso's anti-elitism below, but first let us examine his attitude toward the notion of prisca theologia advocated by the philosophizing kabbalist. To put it simply, Cardoso finds in the notion of prisca theologia the root of the evil besetting the Jewish people in their exile. Just like the more conservative rabbinic establishment, Cardoso opposed the philosophical reinterpretation of Kabbalah and defended the position that Israel's scriptural revelation stands above, and is very different from, pagan philosophy. But Cardoso also stands opposed to the rabbinic establishment because it has rejected the messianic claim of Sabbatai Zebi and is, therefore, preventing the Jewish people from moving through faith (in Sabbatai Zebi as Messiah) to knowledge of God (through the writings of Cardoso himself). In an intellectual tour de force, Cardoso strikes at both the philosophizing kabbalists and the rabbinic establishment with a single attack. He accuses the rabbinic tradition, since the close of the Talmud, of having forsaken the knowledge of God which had been the unique possession of Israel and adopting in its place a false idea of God which the pagan philosophers had also proclaimed. Unbeknownst to themselves, the rabbis and the Jewish exponents of prisca theologia are in fundamental agreement! "From the time of the Geonim until now, all Israel believes, just as the Muslims and the philosophers do, that the creator is the First Cause who is also the God of Israel and whose name is YHVH." ('al Ziuf ha-'emunah, "On the Corruption of the Faith," p. 296.) Cardoso views the post-talmudic rabbinic tradition as being heavily influenced by pagan philosophy. In particular, he singles out Saadya Gaon and Maimonides as the primary culprits responsible for this corruptive influence. The influence of pagan philosophy led to the identification of the God of revelation with the First Cause, the unitary, undifferentiated, infinite source of all existence. Maimonides carried the misidentification of Israel's God with and a nonestablishment elite, namely, men like Cardoso, Nathan of Gaza, and other Sabbatian leaders. I would agree with Bonfil that the Kabbalah becomes in the the seventeenth century a medium for the "restructuring of religious space and time" (Bonfil 1992a, p. 418).</page><page sequence="23">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 85 the First Cause so far that all trace of the God of revelation was effaced from Judaism, as Cardoso explains: And the amazing fact is that the Rambam, a man versed beyond others in every form of wisdom, and who had read and understood every book, declares himself to be a believer in the truth of what is contained in the writings of Hermes Trismegistus, the priests of Egypt, Socrates, Plato, and, more than all the others, his beloved Aristotle, namely, that the First Cause has no spiritual potencies, no name, no form in any way. He writes in the Moreh Nevukhim that the First Cause is wise but not in virtue of wisdom, discerning but not in virtue of discernment, powerful but not in virtue of power, real but not in virtue of reality, one but not in virtue of oneness, and so on. How could it ever have entered his mind or found a place in his faith that the God of Israel is the First Cause, or that his name is YHVH? Doesn't the Holy One, blessed be He, have attributes, names, and forms according to the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, and is this claim not found everywhere in the writings of the tanaim and amoraim and geonim, but he [Rambam] always interprets all this as if it were meant literally. ('al Ziuf ha-'emunah, pp. 296-297) The truth that rabbinic tradition abandoned, but which can be found in the Scriptures, in aggadic midrash, and in the kabbalistic tradition, is that Israel's God is a divine Person who emanated from the First Cause and is the unifying force inhering within the configurations of the ten sefirot, but especially within the male configuration of Tiferet, called the Holy One, blessed be He, and the female configuration of Malkhut, also called the Shekhinah. At the heart of Cardoso's complex vision of the investiture of the unifying power within the sefirotic configurations is the idea that Israel's God stands revealed in the joining of male and female configurations within the emanated pleroma, and that the undifferentiated unity of the First Cause plays no role in Israel's history, or indeed in the world's history. The First Cause did not create the material cosmos, and it has no providential relation with humanity or, more particularly, with Israel. But the rabbis, seduced by philosophy and its worship of abstract unity, have forsaken the knowledge of God and his unity with his Shekhinah in favor of the worship of the First Cause.28 This 28. I believe that Cardoso's emphasis upon Israel's ignorance of the true nature of God as the source of its exilic condition may ultimately derive from arguments advanced by the influential anti-Jewish polemical writings of Alphonso de Valladolid (as Abner of Burgos was known after his conversion ca. 1322). For a good general discussion of the work of Alphonso, see Shamir</page><page sequence="24">86 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK is also the mistake made by the philosophizing kabbalists, who turn all their attention to the infinite source of the emanated world, the Eyn Sof which they interpret in the light of the Neoplatonic One, and which they identify with the God of revelation. In the preceding quotation it is evident that Cardoso means to equate the entire Maimonidean tradition with the views of those who maintain that Jewish wisdom is one with the prisca theologia. Indeed, Cardoso agrees that Jewish tradition is one with the prisca theologia, but that tradition is a profound corruption of the true prisca theologia Judaica, the original knowledge of God held by Israel in biblical and talmudic times. Let me summarize. Cardoso stands opposed to rabbinic authority because the rabbis have forgotten the knowledge of the nature of God, a knowledge which had been Israel's unique possession. They have replaced that original knowledge with the knowledge of the First Cause, a knowledge commonly held by all humanity. Cardoso also stands opposed to the philosophical reinterpretation of the Kabbalah as prisca theologia. In fact, Cardoso equates the whole post-talmudic rabbinic tradition with this latter tendency. The falsehood at the heart of both the rabbinic tradition and the philosophizing kabbalist is the idea that Israel's God is the unitary, undifferentiated source of all existence. In contrast to this misrepresentation of Israel's God, Cardoso offers a return to the truth once known to Israel alone among the nations: that the God who has a providential concern for Israel and humanity, the God revealed in the Scriptures, aggada, and Kabbalah, is the divine person who is the unifying force joining together and inhering within the Holy One, blessed be he, and his Shekhinah. Israel's exile and fall from greatness are due to her forgetting the knowledge of God. Finally, Cardoso sees himself as sharing with Sabbatai Zebi the messianic role of bringing the knowledge of the nature of God back to Israel. This is a messianic role because it is this 1975, pp. 40-60. See also Rosenthal 1961 for a letter by Alphonso on this subject, and an extended response from R. Yosef Shalom. Like Cardoso much later (cf. 'al Ziuf ha-'emunah, p. 296) Alphonso seems to have linked this claim with the line in the prophecy of Azariah to Asa, recorded in 2 Chon 15:3, that Israel will be (he takes the line to refer to the future, not the past as the context suggests) "without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law [torah]" (RSV trans.). Alphonso takes "true God" ('elohey 'emet) to refer to the trinitarian plurality within the divine which the Jews fail to acknowledge, and, although he interprets the divine plurality differently, this is the same polemical point that Cardoso is making against the rabbis. I intend to offer a full account of the exegetical history of this prophecy in a projected book-length study of Cardoso.</page><page sequence="25">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 87 knowledge which is the key to Israel's salvation. Cardoso is opposed, then, to both philosophy and established religious authority. In opposing both, he positions himself on the side of the people, who have been falsely taught by the rabbis to worship the First Cause, and who have been simply scorned by the philosophizing kabbalists as incapable of grasping the profounder truths of the prisca theologia. He prides himself on the fact that, as he says ('iggeret Dalet, p. 212), "in the first place I didn't speak in a style of concealment but in complete openness. .. and I never denied any man who wanted it permission to read my writings or to listen to them, and I never required any man to swear that he would never repeat what he heard." In 'ani Mekhuneh, p. 119, Cardoso describes some of his detractors as agreeing that he possesses true wisdom but blaming him for spreading his knowledge among "worthless men, unlettered Jews ['amey ha-'arez], boys and women," Cardoso responds their charge in the following words: ... all my intellectual efforts throughout my life, as I went from country to country and pored over every book, are directed toward fullfilling the commandment of investigating, interpreting, and seeking out who ha-Shem is, since ha-Shem is not the First Cause. I understood and recognized that I have been given strength from God to spread the mystery of His faith [sod 'emunato]. Cardoso wants, then, to bring the people of Israel back to a knowledge of God. In the following passage of 'ani Mekhuneh, Cardoso is speaking about a group of his opponnents who concede the importance of knowing God but deny that most people are capable of it. In his vehement defense of the ability of all Israel to know God, we may see one of the clearest expressions of Cardoso's anti-elitist position, which consisted in a denunciation of the traditional rabbinic establishment and also the philosophizing kabbalists for having led the people astray from the authentic knowledge of God they once possessed, and for blocking access to the kabbalistic teachings which could, with the aid of Cardoso's writings, restore that knowledge to the people once more.29 29. I think we must see in Cardoso's anti-elitist stance the source of Nehemiah Hayon's position in the introduction which he wrote Oz le-'elohim, a commentary upon Raza de- Mehemnuta (probably Cardoso's work and known to be so by Hayon; see Liebes 1995b and 1995c). Carlebach 1990, p. 99, characterizes Hayon's "open advocacy of individual inquiry into the most secret and sacred questions of religion, untrammeled by the bonds of tradition," and she further describes how this advocacy "obviated the obligations of submission to rabbinic authority and interpretation."

Hagiz and others</page><page sequence="26">88 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK And there is another group who concedes that it is desirable to know the Holy One, blessed be He, and to seek Him and to understand the faith of His Shekhinah. However, they assert that our intellects are not worthy of receiving and understanding a thing as profound as this. To these people the prophet replies [Hosea 6:3; RSV translation], "[Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord;] His going forth is sure as the dawn; He will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth." This verse is saying that just as the dawn comes without prompting and continues to bring light to the eyes of all humanity, so ha-Shem, may He be blessed, is ready to be discovered by by anyone who seeks to know Him. There is no peril in this search; on the contrary, He will come like the spring rain that waters the earth for our benefit and our salvation, and so forth. Because of all this, we are obliged to make known the unity of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shekhinah to our children and to our children's children, as it is said [Deut 6:6-7; RSV translation], "And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children," and the sages add, "to the least one, the ones who need education." And if this thing is beyond the heart of all the children of Israel, how can we be commanded to exercise our discernment and understanding throughout the day and night, when we lie down and when we rise up, in every hour and every place? And if you will investigate this with the power of the intellect, you will understand that the knowledge of ha-Shem, blessed be He, shall have its inception at the end of the exile not from the sages [hahamim] and not from the greatest [gedolim], but from the least significant one [ha-qetanim], in accordance with the words of ha-Shem to Jeremiah [Jer 31:34; RSV translation], "And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest." And it might have been more fitting to say "from the greatest of them to the least," on the grounds that at first it behooves the wise and the great to seek and to understand and to know ha-Shem, and afterwards the teaching and the knowledge would spread out in such a way that the least significant people and the uneducated people ['ammey ha-'arezot] would all know who ha-Shem is. But he [Jeremiah] prophesized what will happen and he wrote in what sequence it will happen, namely, that first the least significant ones will receive the faith of His reality, and afterwards the great ones will receive it, just as you see happening today. And if this sequence will be followed after the redemption, to silence Hayon had influenced my own understanding of Cardoso's relationship with the rabbinic establishment. See also Rozen 1992, pp. 84-89, for a discussion of the response of Rafael Mordekhai Malki to the anti-elitist challenge of Sabbatianism.</page><page sequence="27">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 89 then how much more so prior to it. And the saying of Isaiah [Isa 11:9; RSV translation], "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea," means that for both the least significant people as well as for the greatest it is necessary to enter the sea at its edge, where it is shallow and the waters are smooth, and where it is appropriate for both great and small alike. And just as the depth, which is in the middle of the sea, is not for the least significant but for the great who know how to swim, so the edge of the sea is given essentially to the least significant people. And the secret is that ha-Shem, blessed be He, desires the least significant to know Him at the end of the exile... Therefore the majority of the sages of this generation shall always be opposed to this issue, whether by their power or by their vacuous reasoning. May a storm sweep them all away!... It is a fact that the great and the wise are responsible for diminishing the spread of knowledge and for delaying our salvation. ('ani Mekhuneh, pp. 118-119.) Cardoso's anti-elitism combines two facets: (1) an opposition to the power wielded by the rabbinic establishment that is being used to keep the people in subservience through enforced ignorance, and (2) an opposition to the esotericism which implies that the intellectual capacity of the general Jewish population is inherently below that required for comprehending God truly. Of course, esotericism serves, according to Cardoso, to keep the rabbinic establishment in power, but it can also serve any elite that is unwilling to let the people judge for itself whether it holds the true interpretation of Jewish revelation. Cardoso will therefore, in other contexts, argue that the fact that some Sabbatian leaders keep their teachings secret is evidence that their teachings are not in line with the true knowledge of God that is corporate Israel's original possession. Cardoso's anti-elistism has, therefore, both anti-establishment and anti-esoteric thrusts, which sometimes work together, as in the previously quoted passage.30 An understanding of Cardoso's anti-elitism permits us to recognize the deeper motivation behind his messianic self-understanding. Cardoso, as we have seen, perceives the religious establishment to be the enemy standing in the way of Israel's (re-)acquiring knowledge of God and the salvation (end of exile) which flows from it. Let me suggest that the prism through which 30. I am indebted to an anonymous referee for suggesting the nuanced distinction between anti-elitism in the service of an anti-establishment polemic and anti-elitism in the service of anti-esotercism.</page><page sequence="28">90 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Cardoso views his relationship to the people and to their religious leaders is that which he carried with him from Spain. The Israel with which Cardoso identifies is the Israel of the crypto-Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, those forced into ignorance of their authentic traditions and into the acceptance of a faith which is, in Cardoso's eyes, a corruption of that tradition. The rabbinic establishment is seen by Cardoso in the mold of the ecclesiastical authorities in Spain who opposed any effort directed toward the recovery of their forebears' traditions on the part of the crypto-Jews. Cardoso is not unlike many other escaped crypto-Jews in his continuing identification with the NaCdo, the wider community of crypto-Jews wherever they may be.31 Cardoso does not see his own escape from Spain as permitting a simple reentry into the Jewish people, because for him, corporate Israel is suffering the same fate as the crypto-Jews. Only the restoration to Israel of the authentic knowledge of God will put an end to the people's suffering in exile.32 Given this spiritual physiognomy, Cardoso cannot truly overcome his crypto-Jewish past until the Jewish people are redeemed from their exile. So long as Israel's Judaism is crypto-Judaisnm-the enforced worship of the God of the nations coupled with a longing for redemption, Cardoso cannot find a home in Israel. Sabbatai Zebi inaugurated the redemption of Israel, but he could not complete the process. According to Cardoso ('iggeret le-Yizhaq Qardoso, p. 291), Sabbatai Zebi's messianic task required him to assume the identity of the crypto-Jew by separating himself from his people: "the King Messiah was destined to become a forced convert [anus, 'converso'] like me" precisely in order to atone for Israel's years of "idolatry." While Sabbatai Zebi's messianic trajectory leads from membership in Israel to literal crypto-Judaism, Cardoso's own messianic trajectory begins with literal crypto-Judaism and must pass through an identification with the people of Israel. Cardoso assumes the role which Israel as a whole is called to play, namely, witnessing to the true nature of God. This witnessing is the essence of the Shema', and we have seen that Cardoso believes that he is teaching 31. Goldish 1994, p. 236, writes that "a Portuguese Jew of London or Amsterdam would feel far more kinship with his unrepenant countryman who remained a practicing Catholic in the Iberian Peninsula than he would with any Ashkenazi no matter how religious." 32. Cardoso was not alone in viewing the condition of the crypto-Jews of the Iberian Peninsula to be, as it were, a living exemplum of Israel's sin of idolatry (although he was alone in understanding this sin metaphysically), and in seeing escape from the Iberian Peninsula as ushering in a messianic future. See, for example, Kaplan 1989a, pp. 373-374, for a discussion of the messianic speculations of Daniel Levi de Barrios, a contemporary of Cardoso.</page><page sequence="29">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 91 Israel its meaning. In restoring the knowledge of God to Israel, Cardoso is restoring to Israel its preeminence among the nations. In the following passage, although rather heavily laden with kabbalistic imagery, Cardoso very clearly contrasts his own messianic mission with that of Sabbatai Zebi, and we may see how powerfully his past as a crypto-Jew has shaped his perception of the messianic drama begun with Sabbatai Zebi. Abraham Cardoso. . .was destined to be born among.the uncircumcised in order to bring forth the sparks which fell from holiness and also the sparks which fell from Yesod in accordance with the secret of the emission. And the gazelle [zebi] always turns its face towards the place from which it came, and this relates to the Messiah son of David, who had to depart from the entirety of Israel, from the Torah, and from holiness into impuiity and even from his body, which must return to him, in order to hasten the ingathering, and because of all this his name is Zebi. But the Messiah son of Ephraim shall go from impurity into holiness, and it is not fitting for him to turn his face back toward the place from which he came. Because the uncircumcised are now declaring Jesus to be like God, it is fitting for the Messiah son of Ephraim to say "Who is like God?" [miy kha-'el, a pun on Cardoso's second name] ... and that is why from all time his name was Michael and not Zebi. (Qodesh Yisra'el, pp. 265-266.) Cardoso's trajectory from impurity to purity and Sabbatai Zebi's trajectory from purity to impurity must both, of course, culminate in a single point, the redemption of Israel. Cardoso wants the Jewish people to keep their sight on that future point of conjunction and not despair over the debasement of the Messiah son of David. In a sense, Sabbatai Zebi has not only stepped outside Israel, he has stepped backwards in time as Israel moves forward toward redemption with the aid of Cardoso, the Messiah son of Ephraim, who represents Israel's future. The death of Sabbatai Zebi has locked him in that past, and only Israel's redemption can save him and bring back to him his body (through resurrection). It is not going too far to say that Cardoso undertakes to redeem the Messiah son of David as he undertakes to redeem Israel, as he suggests in numerous passages in Qodesh Yisra 'el with which we began this study. In the very first lines (p. 253) we read: "The Messiah son of David is not complete without the Messiah son of Ephraim, and the son of Joseph is not a complete redeemer without the Messiah son of David." Of course, each Messiah needs the other, but only the messiah son of Ephraim is alive now: "Beneath the heavens there is no one besides the Messiah son of</page><page sequence="30">92 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Ephraim who is granted the power to awaken the supernal joy [of the union of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Shekhinah] because he is alive and 'the dead do not praise God.'" Let us now look more closely at how Cardoso describes the goal of his and Sabbatai Zebi's messianic trajectories, namely, their union in the future redemption. Cardoso as Kabbalist and the Unity of the Messiahs Before we look more closely at Cardoso's teaching regarding the unity of the two Messiahs, we need to say a few words about how his anti-elitism shapes his use of Kabbalah. First of all, Cardoso forgoes all reference to the fulfillment of the com- mandments as having theurgic power, the power to unify the male and female aspects of God. Instead, he makes knowledge itself a theurgic force. The severance of the Shekhinah from the Holy One, blessed be He, is, according to Cardoso, the result of Israel's forgetting the nature of divinity. Israel's exile and the Shekhinah's exile result from Israel's fall from epistemic unity with God. The recovery of this epistemic unity will result in the unification of the male configuration of the Holy One, blessed be he, with His Shekhinah. We may call this epistemic theurgy. Epistemic theurgy is effective, however, only when practiced by all Israel at once, and it is, by its very nature, messianic in function. Redemption, the ending of the exile, depends upon collective epistemic theurgy. Cardoso has in other words, reduced the whole variety of kabbalistic theurgic practice down to a single act, knowing God, and he has broadened the range of practitioners of the theurgic act from the few kabbalistic elite to all Israel. Another difference between Cardoso and traditional Kabbalah has to do with his introduction of a new object of visionary ecstasy, one more accessible to corporate Israel. Although Cardoso wants to teach Israel the knowledge of the nature of God, he also wants Israel to share in the transformative power of the mystical vision at the heart of traditional Kabbalah. But he does not expect all Israel to soar to ecstatic heights; rather he offers Israel another object to contemplate, the union of the two Messiahs. For Cardoso, the union of the two Messiahs mirrors the union of the male sefirah of Yesod and the female sefirah of Malkhut, which in turn mirrors the restoration of the First Adam (Adam Qadmon), the divine person in whom all the sefirotic</page><page sequence="31">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 93 configurations find their unity and in whose image the human Adam was created. In contemplating the union of the two Messiahs, Israel is able to reach an understanding of the highest levels of the divine pleroma and of the perfect image of humanity which the messianic age will restore. The messianic image of Sabbatai Zebi and Cardoso together is a medium in which may be seen the restored perfection of the divine and human realms, and it is this vision which will lead Israel toward its redemption. In the following passage Cardoso begins with a concrete image of the union of the male and female sefirot and then explains how the unity of two the Messiahs, Sabbatai Zebi and himself, both represents and brings into being this higher unity. In the conclusion of the passage Cardoso states that the resurrection of Sabbatai Zebi will take place during his own lifetime. You already know that we use the very same termn--"foundation" [Yesod]-to refer both to the excavation in the earth which is made prior to building a house and also to that which is placed within the excavation and which holds the house rising up over it. Now the earth is Malkhut, and the excavation is the Yesod of Malkhut, and also the structure which is erected within her is Yesod, and it is necessary that there be unity between the two. And the same is true concerning Adam and Eve, who are together called Adam, because the male alone is not Adam. And the same is true concerning the Messiah son of David and the Messiah son of Ephraim, who both together are called Messiah just as each separately is the Messiah. And the very term Mashiah ["Messiah"] demonstrates this fact: the Messiah is referred to as "Name" [shem], and from Shem comes the Messiah son of David "And David made a name [shem; 2 Sam 8:13]"--and Yesod is called "Living" [hay]-"Joseph is living" [Gen 45:26---and from him comes the Messiah son of Ephraim. Now when you join shem and hay you get mashiah, reading each word "from the bottom to the top" [i.e., backwards], and you get "Living Name" [hey shem] when you read "from the top to the bottom." And you have already read how in the recitation of the Shema' one unites the Brother ['ah, the first two letters of 'ahad, and referring in kabbalistic terms to the Holy One, blessed be He] with His Name [His shem, i.e., the Shekhinah; shem contains the first two consonants of the Shema'], thus bringing about the word 'esmah ["I will take pleasure," a reference to the supernal union of male and female; the verb also contains the consonants of the word mashiah]. In this way too the unity of the two Messiahs "will take pleasure," and then ha-Shem "will take pleasure" in his creation, and Israel "will take pleasure" in its deeds, and "Moses will take pleasure" [a quotation from the the Sabbath morning 'Amidah] and "He raises the poor from the dust"--the Messiah son of David, "and lifts the needy from the ash heap"-the</page><page sequence="32">94 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK Messiah son of Ephraim, "to make them sit with princes" [Ps 113:7-8; RSV translation]. As it is written, "For I know that my Redeemer is living [hay, Job 19:25a]"--this is the Messiah son of Ephraim--"and at last he will stand up upon the dust" [Job 19:25b]-this is the Messiah son of David. And the meaning is that the Messiah son of Ephraim must stand up from the ash heap, and the Messiah son of David must stand up from the dust, and one word, "stand" [yaqum], is used for both individuals. "My living redeemer" will stand up, and afterwards he [the Messiah son of David] will stand up upon the dust, and these things will happen together [yahad], and for this reason the word "stand" is associated with the Messiah son of David, but the word's letters sum up to the same value as the letters of "Joseph" [another way of referring to the Messiah son of Ephraim as Messiah son of Joseph]. (Qodesh Yisra'el, pp. 260-261) In ecstatic Kabbalah, as Elliot Wolfson (1994, 1995a) has amply shown, the mystic seeks a vision of the union of the Holy One, blessed be He, and his Shekhinah which is described in overtly sexual terms, and which translates into the more concentrated image of the "crowned phallus" of the Godhead, the conjunction of the sefirot of Yesod and Malkhut. When the phallus is crowned, the female has been rejoined to male and their unity is complete, even though it means the effacement of the separate identity of the female and her absorption into the male as the corona of the phallus. When Cardoso speaks of the unity of the two Messiahs, he adopts precisely this figure, the crowned phallus, to represent it, with himself assuming the identity of the phallus, and Sabbatai Zebi that of the corona. It is not God's coronated phallus which he wants Israel to behold, but the Messiah's. In one particularly revealing ritual of reparation (tiqqun) which Cardoso details in Qodesh Yisra 'el, we find the erotics of ecstatic Kabbalah redirected toward the union of Cardoso and Sabbatai Zebi. Take two branches, the first from a palm tree. Let it be your intention that this branch is the Messiah son of Ephraim, the righteous Yesod, and say [Ps 92:12; RSV translation], "The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon." And the intention behind the words, "righteous... like a palm tree" is that the letters sum up to "Abraham Cardoso" [864], and also "cedar" sums up to "sun" [shemesh], and that is Yesod. The point is that because the palm is male and female together [the palm flower is "perfect," possessing both stamens and pistil], which are Yesod and Malkhut, there is an allusion to the Messiahs together.</page><page sequence="33">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 95 The single palm branch, says Cardoso, represents himself, the Messiah son of Ephraim, and his union with his "female half," Sabbatai Zebi, the Messiah son of David. How this unity is intended to be concretely imaged is made explicit in the symbolism of the second branch used in this tiqqun. And now take one branch from the pomegranate tree and say [Num 33:19; RSV translation], "And they traveled from Rithmah, and encamped at Rimmon- perez." And let your intention be that the exile is bitter as the broom plant [rotem], and redemption, together with the ingathering of the exiles, is sweet, like the pomegranate, when all Israel is under its king. And the pomegranante is a crowned king, and all his people are contained within him. So this is the meaning of the verse: "And they traveled from exile, and they encamped in the Messiah son of David," for he is "Rimmon" son of "Perez," son of Judah. And consider, too, that rimmon, spelled resh, mem, vav, nun, sums up to the same value as the name Shabtay [Sabbatai]. The pomegranate fruit with its green crown is the symbol of the royal, Davidic Messiah. But it is also the symbol of the Messiah son of Ephraim. But the Messiah son of Ephraim is also a pomegranate because the Yesod contains all Israel, in accordance with the secret meaning of the verse, "These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph" [Gen 37:2]. The generations of Jacob are all Israel, and Joseph contains them. The seed-bearing fruit is like the phallus, containing the fullness of Israel's generations, and so it is like Joseph, who contains Israel within him. The Messiah son of Ephraim, who is the culmination of Joseph's progeny, also contains all Israel within him, and so does the Messiah son of David, in whom Israel is "encamped." And there is another reason why the pomegranate can represent the Messiah son of Ephraim. Cardoso goes on to explain: "Yesod possesses a crown [the corona of the phallus], and in this respect Yesod is a pomegranate." With this explanation we see that the pomegranate symbolizes each Messiah in turn, and their unity. The pomegranate's crown symbolizes the Messiah son of David, and the fruit symbolizes the Messiah son of Ephraim. The crown and the fruit, in turn, symbolize the crowned phallus, and this is the image of the union of Yesod and Malkhut. Sabbatai Zebi and Cardoso are, in their unity, likened to the union of the male and female configurations of the divine pleroma. Cardoso has adopted a daring symbol--the union of the two Messiahs as the coronated phallus-in order to appropriate the</page><page sequence="34">96 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK esoteric teaching of the Kabbalah and make it imaginatively powerful for corporate Israel. Of course, this symbol undoubtedly plays a significant role in Cardoso's psychic economy, suggesting as it does homoerotic desire and a large measure of narcissistic fantasy regarding his own masculinity. We may certainly also read Cardoso's use of the term r 'oshiy "my head," which we have seen above clearly refers to Yesod, as a name for his supernal alter-ego, in the light of this narcissistic fascination. I cannot in the space of this paper do justice to the complex issues raised here. I would suggest, however, that Cardoso's "phallic narcissism," if we may call it that, will ultimately take us back to the broader social and historical dimension within which Cardoso is acting. Cardoso offers rather extraordinary testimony about a question which must have been raised about many former crypto-Jews, namely, whether they had been properly circumcised. He states ('iggeret Dalet, pp. 220-222) that two women confronted him with the charge (at the behest of Moses and Aaron, who they said had appeared to them previously and told them to go to Cardoso) that he had a "blemish" (pegam) on the site of his circumcision which rendered it improper, and they spread this rumor in several cities. They claimed that his blemish was hindering the coming of the Messiah, and that salvation depended on his repairing the circumcision. We see here the obverse of Cardoso's phallic narcissism, namely, the humiliation endured during his crypto-Jewish past and the place on his body where that past was inscribed, whether or not he had actually been circumcised. In fact, Cardoso advances in proof of his being properly circumcised the claim that his penis did truly have a blemish caused by a faulty circumcision. The circumcision was faulty, he tells us, because he had been born without a foreskin, and after he left Spain, a mohel had removed skin unnecessarily! Whatever we may make of his claim to have been born circumcised (not medically impossible),33 what this must have meant to Cardoso was that while he may have been born in a land of impurity, and considered by its people to be of "impure blood" as a New Christian, his true identity was that of purity, indeed, a natal purity that put him on a plane beyond other Jews. But the sign of his purity is blemished, and therefore called into question. Perhaps we may recognize in his alter-ego, R 'oshiy, a projection of an idealized, unblemished selfhood. If Cardoso's messianic self-conception reflects his phallic narcissism, its roots lie in the profound humiliation endured as a crypto-Jew, something 33. For a discussion of the notion of inherited circumcision in Jewish and non-Jewish sources, see Gilman 1993, pp. 52-56.</page><page sequence="35">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 97 which shaped the experience of many other crypto-Jews as well, as has been argued by Yosef Yerushalmi (1971, see esp. pp. 122-136), Stephen Gilman (1972, pp. 99-122, 130-170), Yosef Kaplan (1989a, see esp. pp. 173-178, and 1989b), and David Ruderman (1995, chap. 10). Kaplan (1989a, p. 173) summarizes well the social and ideological context of this humiliation. The Spain with which we are dealing was surrounded by a fiery wall of messianism and religious purpose; and in this context the question of unsullied Christian descent meant, of course, membership of a Christian family of long standing, including neither in its pedigree nor in its living representatives the slightest hint of the presence of "New Christians" of Jewish origin. The scions of the original chosen people came to be held of low account, and indeed in contempt, by the self-styled successors to their elected status-those Spaniards of uncompromised Christian descent who were carrying the Christian gospel to the world at large. Perhaps most appositely, Yerushalmi (1971, pp. 122-136) describes a virulently antisemitic medical treatise written by one Don Juan de Quifiones, an associate of Abraham Cardoso's older brother Isaac in Madrid. Quifiones states that among the punishments which Jewish men must endure throughout time for their having persecuted the "true Messiah" is menstruation. "If Jewish males menstruate," writes Yerushalmi (p. 128), "they are, in effect, no longer men but women, and the crime of deicide has been punished by castration." We may understand better the nature of Abraham Cardoso's phallic narcissism if we place it within the context of the "machismo" antisemitism of seventeenth-century Spain. The continuing presence of the a sense of being blemished, somehow impure, because of his crypto-Jewish past, is evidenced also in one further meaning which Cardoso attaches to the union of the two Messiahs. Their union according to Cardoso represents the unification of all Israel: the house of Judah with the dispersed tribes of Joseph. This is a point which Cardoso makes at the beginning and the end of Qodesh Yisra 'el, where he recalls that the lineage of the Messiah son of Ephraim goes back to the first king of the Northern Kingdom, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who is seen as the greatest idolater in Israel's history and the one who was ultimately responsible for the dispersion of the ten northern tribes. Here again we see the obverse side of Cardoso's messianic narcissism; he is descended from the greatest sinner</page><page sequence="36">98 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK in Israel's history. However, the division between the two royal lines which began with Jeroboam will finally be ended with the union of the two Messiahs. You have already noted the affair of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and this extends all the way down to the Messiah son of David and the Messiah son of Ephraim, between whom there will be conflict and jealousy until the end time, and then "Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not harass Ephraim" [Isa 11:131. (Qodesh Yisra'el, p. 253) Because of Jeroboam's sin, Cardoso says near the end of this drush, he, Cardoso, was destined to be born in a land where he was forced to be an "idol worshiper." We have seen that Cardoso views Sabbatai Zebi's apostasy as an atonement for Israel's idolatry; now we see that Cardoso's crypto-Jewish past is an atonement for the sin of Jeroboam. Once this sin has been atoned for, the dispersion of the ten tribes will come to an end. This messianic hope was widely held by Jews and Christians alike at the time,34 and for Cardoso, it must have meant especially the cessation of the plight of the Jews on the Iberian Peninsula. We see again how powerfully Cardoso's experience as a crypto-Jew has shaped his imagination. His messianic task requires him to teach the Jews outside the Iberian Peninsula the truth about God in order to free them from their unwitting "metaphysical idolatry," and once this has been achieved, the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula will be freed from their enforced idolatry. Clearly, one of the driving forces behind Cardoso's messianism is his continuing identification with the suffering of the crypto-Jews.35 Conclusion We began this paper with the claim that Cardoso's theological and messialogical speculations seek to downplay the image of a debased Messiah, 34. See the evidence collected in the various essays in Kaplan, Mechoulan, and Popkin 1989. 35. We may perhaps invoke Popkin's phrase "Marrano theology" to describe Cardoso's messianism. Unlike La Peyrere, about whose messianic views Popkin coined the term, Cardoso is vehemently opposed to Jewish conversion, but he shares with La Peyrere the sense that the salvation of all the Jews depends upon a messianic drama which uses the crypto-Jewish condition as its major motif. For his discussion of La Peyrere's Marrano theology, see Popkin 1973 and 1987, pp. 22-24.</page><page sequence="37">ABRAHAM MIGUEL CARDOSO'S MESSIANISM 99 and to demonstrate that Sabbatai Zebi's apostasy was not an act that should be imitated. In place of the image of the debased Messiah, Cardoso holds out to Israel the glorious image of the resurrected Messiah unified with the Messiah son of Ephraim, who together embody Israel's recovered grandeur among the nations. Cardoso uses the intellectual debates of his day surrounding the status of knowledge versus faith and the existence of a prisca theologia in order to position himself against the rabbinic establishment as well as against the philosophizing kabbalists, both of whom, according to Cardoso, stand opposed to the spread of knowledge among the Jewish people. Cardoso's anti-elitism has its roots in his continuing identification with the crypto-Jewish community in the Iberian Peninsula and his sense that all Israel is suffering the same plight in a form of "metaphysical idolatry" imposed upon them by the rabbinic authorities. The image of the unified Messiahs serves Cardoso as a powerful symbol of the redeemed future of Israel, and it crystallizes for corporate Israel the otherwise esoteric kabbalistic teaching concerning the unity of the male and female configurations within the divine pleroma. The more accessible image of the union of the two Messiahs, each having a historical reality, goes hand in hand with the anti-philosophical knowledge of the nature of God which Cardoso seeks to spread among the Jewish people. Finally, Cardoso's messianic self-understanding can be seen to have its roots in his continuing sense of profound humiliation about his crypto-Jewish past. Cardoso's messianism must be understood within the framework of his phallic narcissism, the obverse side of the wounds inflicted by his experience as a crypto-Jew. This interaction of psychodynamics and history deserves a much longer treatment, which I hope to provide in a subsequent study.36 University of California, Davis Davis, Calif. 36. In particular, I would draw out the full implications of Cardoso's messianic mission to reveal the secrets of Israel's faith with his identification with the "unveiled," i.e., circumcised, Yesod, which, in turn, reflects his standing revealed to the world as an unblemished Jew, no longer needing to hide behind any mask, even if it be merely the mask of "the proper profile of the Jewish community within Christian Europe," in Ruderman's phrase (Ruderman 1995, p. 225). On the relationship between the revelation of secrets and the unveiling of Yesod. see Liebes 1993a, pp. 24-26, and Wolfson 1994, pp. 336-345 and passim.</page><page sequence="38">100 BRUCE ROSENSTOCK References Aptowitzer, V., and Schwarz, A.
