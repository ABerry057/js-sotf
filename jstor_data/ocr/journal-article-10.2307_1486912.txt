<plain_text><page sequence="1">Florentino Garcia Martinez and Julio Trebolle Barrera. The People of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Their Writings, Beliefs and Practices. Trans. Wilfred G. E. Watson. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1995. ix, 269 pp. Although the volume under review might appear from its title to be another "Introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls," it differs from most such books in two significant ways: first, it consists of a series of studies most of which have been published elsewhere and was not composed ab initio as an integrated volume, and second, it reflects the work and approaches of two different</page><page sequence="2">254 BOOK REVIEWS scholars who are individually responsible for separate segments of the book. The book makes no pretense at covering all aspects of Qumran research, although the subject areas covered are among the most significant in this scholarly discipline. The volume thus resembles two sets of selected essays that have been integrated into a coherent sequence. Further contributing to the lack of unity is the fact that some of the material was clearly aimed at a fairly popular audience in its original presentation, while some of it was presented in more academic contexts. There is also the minor annoyance that, whereas the essays by Garcia Martinez have their original locus of publication listed, the chapters by Trebolle Barrera do not. The book is divided into three fairly broad sections: "The Men and the Community of Qumran," "The Bible, Purity and Messianic Hope," and "Qumran and the Origins of Christianity." The individual chapters of each section do not cohere tightly, and there is a certain amount of repetition in some of the chapters by the two authors (e.g., chapters 1 and 2 both provide similar introductions to Qumran scholarship). Some of the introductory material, especially the first chapter, which is a sort of introduction to the introductions, is a fairly bland prologue to the history of the scrolls, anchored firmly in the view that they were products of Qumran, and not of the Jerusalem or Temple library, as held by Norman Golb, and in the assertion that the settlement at Qumran was linked to the caves where the scrolls were found. Also rejected are the idiosyncratic views of Robert Eisenman and Barbara Thiering, which claim a Judeo-Christian, first-century C.E. date for the scrolls. In this regard, this volume stands squarely in the mainstream of Qumran scholarship. The theory used by Garcia Martinez to explain the history of the group that wrote the scrolls is known to the scholarly world as the Gr6ningen hypothesis, and Garcia Martinez is one of its inventors and main supporters. In one of the more valuable chapters in the book, he lays out the alternatives to this hypothesis and attempts to refute them, presenting the evidence for the origin of the Qumran community as part of the larger Essene movement during the high priesthood of John Hyrcanus (135-104 B.C.E.). The sectarian community of Qumran was thus Essene, but not completely so, since it broke with the main branch of the movement over a variety of important, primarily halakhic, issues. Trebolle Barrera adds to Garcia Martinez's introduction some mild remarks on the publication history of the scrolls, defending the lack of speed so frequently criticized in recent years. What the book lacks is the glue that could hold its discrete chap-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 255 ters together and make these distinct treatments into an introductory or intermediate-level general work on Qumran and the scrolls. In fact, for a reader to benefit fully from some of the chapters, previous knowledge of the scrolls is virtually indispensable. On the other hand, some of the less popular, more scholarly, essays are valuable contributions to the literature on Qumran. There is also an imbalance in the three major divisions of the book: the several prefatory and introductory essays belong together, and the third major portion of the book, "Qumran and the Origins of Christianity," actually holds together as a group of essays with an overarching unity. But the central section, "Bible, Purity and Messianic Hope," does not form an integrated category. Each of these is an important discrete topic in Qumran studies, and the individual essays are useful summaries of the significant issues involved. But they have nothing in common other than the fact that they are not introductory and do not deal with the New Testament. The very fact that one section of the book, albeit the shortest, is devoted to "Qumran and the Origins of Christianity" indicates the audience to whom the volume appears to be directed. Unlike Schiffman's Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, which attempts to relocate the study of the scrolls in a thoroughly Jewish matrix, these essays highlight the possible links between Qumran and early Christianity, although the treatment of the possible connections is conservative, careful, and unsensational. Both Garcia Martinez and Trebolle Barrera stress the absurdities of many of the more outlandish theories, such as those of Thiering and Eisenman, which claim that the scrolls actually refer in code to a number of significant figures in early Christianity. Likewise, like VanderKam in The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, they both underscore the ways in which Christianity diverges sharply from the rigorous legal milieu of the Qumran scrolls despite some of the attractive superficial resemblances between them. This volume, then, cannot substitute for a sound general introduction to the scrolls. But there is no doubt that it can be read and studied with profit by scholars of Qumran, and that students of Judaism in late antiquity will also find much of value, provided that the caveats indicated earlier are kept in mind.
