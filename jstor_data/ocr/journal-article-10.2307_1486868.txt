<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY THE MIDRASHIC PROCESS by JOSHUA LEVINSON Irving Jacobs. The Midrashic Process. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. xiii, 218 pp. Over the last decade a plethora of books and monographs on various aspects of rabbinic midrash has been offered to the English-language audience. Irving Jacobs's The Midrashic Process is different from many of these because of its focus and erudition. In this study the author grapples with one of the fundamental issues in rabbinic poetics, the choice of biblical prooftexts in midrashic homilies. Besides the first chapter, which presents itself as a general introduction to midrash, the following seven chapters may be seen as a sustained investigation of exegetical traditions, by which Jacobs means "patterns of exegesis," or the consistent application of certain biblical verses or contexts to specific biblical personalities. Chapters 2 and 3 are concerned with exegetical traditions connected to the book of Job. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are centered around Abraham traditions, especially as realized in Genesis Rabbah 39. The last two chapters are slightly different, which is not surprising, as they appeared as separate articles. The first attempts to uncover exegetical traditions in the book of James, and the last chapter discusses Near Eastern mythological elements in rabbinic aggadah. The book as a whole can be seen as an attempt to uncover popular exegetical traditions that act to both underpin the textual mechanics of the midrash and connect the preaching sage with his audience. The opening chapter, "What is Midrash?", is to my mind both misnamed and misdirected. It is misnamed because it does not supply the reader with an AJS Review 22/1 (1997): 95-102 95</page><page sequence="2">96 JOSHUA LEVINSON introduction to the nature of midrash in general, as its title may lead one to believe. More importantly, it is misdirected because it does not deal in-depth with the actual issues it raises and addresses. In this introductory chapter Jacobs defines midrash along the exegetical axis. In his words: "in simple terms, Midrash is the oldest form of Biblical interpretation" (p. 3). As with much of this book, I find myself taking issue more with what is not said than what is said. There seems to me to be a double lack in this opening position. Firstly, Jacobs has committed what Steven Fraade has felicitously called the "hermeneuticist fallacy"' by ignoring the cultural intertexts of midrash as a discursive practice that could substantially enrich his own exegetical readings. For example, his approach could be enhanced along the lines of the cultural models proposed by Daniel Boyarin.2 Secondly, there is no sustained discussion of exegesis per se, neither historical nor theoretical. Let me enlarge upon this point. In Jacobs's search, mostly successful, after the exegetical traditions presupposed by the midrashic texts he considers, he makes no distinctions between inner-biblical exegesis, Second Temple literature, and early or late rabbinic texts. He collapses all distinctions between the various modes of exegesis and composition. Here, he could take a clue from James Kugel's elegant book on the Joseph traditions.3 Interestingly enough, Jacobs does not mention this book, which deals primarily with the same issue as his own. On the other hand, there is no protracted discussion of the theoretical import of such terms as "exegesis," "plain meaning," and "audience. One cannot state that "midrashic exegesis operates within the parameters of plain meaning" (pp. 3, 7) without attempting to grapple with these problematic terms.4 Similarly, the author places great importance on the intended audience of the texts he considers; however, there is no sophisticated consideration either of actual audiences or of reader-reception theory. In this opening chapter, Jacobs states the central question that governs all of the ensuing chapters: "what were the criteria upon which the selection of the proemical and proof-texts was based?" (p. 1). Much of the earlier work 1. Steven Fraade, From Tradition to Commentary (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), p. 14. 2.

In all fairness, Jacobs does recount in this chapter the well-known positions on "plain meaning," citing mostly Loewe and Weiss-Halivni, but the import of this controversy for the rest of the book is unclear.</page><page sequence="3">THE MIDRASHIC PROCESS 97 on the genre of the proem posited that various rhetorical techniques, such as paronomasia and word-links, guide the choice of the proem text. Joseph Heinemann posited that rhetorical surprise was one of the markers of this genre. The preacher chose a verse whose connection to the lectionary portion was not at first apparent, thus creating surprise and suspense in his audience. Jacobs addresses here a fundamental issue, which to my knowledge has received only limited attention. He is certainly to be praised for attempting to close one of the important gaps in a descriptive poetics of midrash. He points out that "there is substantial evidence in our sources to show that the early preachers, when dealing with certain pentateuchal themes, resorted consistently to the same specific sections of other biblical books for their proemical and proof-texts. This would suggest that there were exegetical traditions linking pentateuchal with prophetic, and particularly hagiographic texts, which were acknowledged, presumably, by both preachers and audiences alike" (p. 22). Certain texts were chosen because of the shared exegetical traditions which linked aspects of pentateuchal narratives with specific sections of other biblical books. This is the main thrust of Jacobs's argument, and one that is basically convincing, at least to this reader. Regarding the proem, Jacobs clearly states his position, following Heine- mannn and others, that the midrash in general and the proem in particular are "derived from homilies and expositions which were actually delivered to live audiences in the ancient synagogues and study houses of the Holy Land" (p. 2). He grudgingly admits that much of the extant material before us has not been preserved in unedited form, and many proems are defective and truncated. This assumption is one of the major presuppositions for his whole project, and as such should not be left unexamined. All the more so because this position has been under attack in recent years from various quarters.5 He compounds this problem by taking the suspect position that most midrashic discourse in general is of a popular nature, provenance, and origin. However, Jacobs never gives us the impression that this underlying assumption may be problematic. 5.

Unfortunately, there is no serious examination of this very problematical category---the popular, as there is no consideration of the complicated trajectories of transmission and redaction which we find in all of rabbinic literature. Likewise, no distinctions are made between the proems found in different rabbinic collections. Certainly the proems of Genesis Rabbah are different from those of Leviticus Rabbah. Not only does Jacobs ignore these patent differences, but he actually collapses the differences between these two collections. In a move which is questionable in my eyes, he stresses the essential identification of Genesis Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah and Pesikta DeRav Kahana in terms of both their composition and their audience. It is especially disappointing to find no discussion of these issues, because they may have significant ramifications for his argument as a whole. The author's ahistorical approach prevents him from investigating central aspects of his own thesis, such as possible differences between "real" and "artificial" proems which seem to be the creation of an editor or editors. In a similar vein, he is likewise prevented from exploring distinctions between the exegetical traditions underlying the proems of Genesis Rabbah and those found in the seemingly "literary" creations of Leviticus Rabbah.6 In a more general vein, the existence of exegetical traditions is certainly not confined to proems, and therefore to approach the subject from this limiting perspective is perhaps misleading. Jacobs's argument could be augmented and refined by connecting it with Kugel's thoughts on a Glossa Ordinaria.7 One would expect, according to Jacobs's approach, that the popular nature of the proems would make them more prone to be built upon shared exegetical traditions. Yet nowhere does he ask whether the proem as a genre is more dependent upon these traditions than other genres. Moreover, it would be an important contribution to know if the proems of Genesis Rabbah and/or Leviticus Rabbah contain more popular exegetical traditions than the other, nonproemical sections of these texts. Unfortunately, the theoretical and historical positions assumed by the author prevent him from addressing these issues. 6. There are some minor objections which should be mentioned here. For some reason Jacobs refers to the amoraic midrashic collections Genesis Rabbah and Leviticus Rabbah as "post-talmudic" (pp. 2, 16). Likewise, he refers to Exodus Rabbah I as a collection of similar age as Genesis Rabbah (p. 7), instead of the accepted dating of this collection to the tenth-eleventh centuries. A.

Kugel, In Potiphar ' House, p. 266.</page><page sequence="5">THE MIDRASHIC PROCESS 99 While Jacobs has convincingly shown that a rich exegetical tradition connects the book of Job to the story of the flood, the reason he posits for this connection is inadequate. He attempts to prove that the presumed Mosaic authorship of the book of Job "would suggest that the main factor which influenced the development of this exegetical tradition, was the basic notion that Moses wrote not only the Torah, but also the Book of Job. As the Pentateuch reveals so little regarding the circumstances which led to the Deluge, the early rabbinic exegetes sought this information specifically in the detailed descriptions of the archetypal wicked, recorded by the Law-giver himself' (p. 42). Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are a sustained discussion of the exegetical traditions found in the proems of chapter 39 of Genesis Rabbah. Once again, Jacobs is attempting to uncover the traditions that form the exegetical grid for these six proems. These exegetical traditions were popularized at an "early period"' through weekly homilies which "have provided much of the material for our extant midrashic works" (p. 79). "In due course, this continuous and widespread practice of publicly expounding the Scriptures in the ancient synagogues, gave rise to a considerable corpus of popular knowledge, not only of the contents of the biblical text, but also of the numerous traditions and legends with which it was embellished" (p. 80). The preacher could rely upon this assumed popular knowledge, not only to establish a rapport with his audience, but also to surprise and challenge them. Thus, the proem verse was selected "because it contains one or more elements which he expected his audience to recognize as an allusion to some aspect of the patriarch's life or character in popular tradition" (p. 81). It is here that Jacobs has most forcefully augmented Heinemann's position, by highlighting both the traditional and the creative aspects of the rabbinic reading formation. In this section the author presents a number of interesting readings which succeed in motivating and elucidating the choice of specific proemical verses. At the same time, it becomes manifest that these exegetical traditions are not necessarily related to public sermons, and one could just as readily say that they originated in the study-houses. This issue is one of the cardinal disputes in 8. This historical obfuscation does not help his argument. Likewise he uses the term "great antiquity" a number of times without informing the reader about which period he is concerned. From further discussions it would seem that he is referring to prebiblical traditions (p. 168), but he is never precise on this crucial point.</page><page sequence="6">100 JOSHUA LEVINSON the modem study of midrash.9 Jacobs's argument would not be substantially different if the assumed Sitz im Leben for these midrashim was the beit midrash and not the synagogue. There is certainly as much, if not more, evidence for a sustained study of biblical texts in the study-houses than there is for an early homiletical context. Not only does he not marshal any actual evidence for the "popular" nature of this material, but his argument, which posits a rich layer of intertextual allusions, would certainly be applicable in the context of a more "informed" audience. In truth, I believe the time has come to abandon such dichotomies as synagogue/study-house and popular/scholastic as unproductive, naive, and ultimately inadequate. One other problem which appears throughout this study is the author's almost cavalier attitude toward the tradition-history of the sources he dis- cusses. For example, Jacobs elucidates an anonymous proem (Genesis Rabbah 39:4) on Abraham which opens with a text from Qohelet (7:19). He astutely points out that what connects these two points is the exegetical tradition which relates wisdom to Torah and Abraham to the sage (p. 81). "We would suggest, therefore, that the application of the term trn to Abraham was based upon a broader background of popular tradition relating both the activities of the patriarch, and the specific meaning of the biblical epithet" (p. 82). However, there is little to be gained by bolstering this argument with proof from Midrash HaGadol, whose sources and creativity are avowedly problematic. Furthermore, this same "proem" appears earlier in Genesis Rabbah in connection with Noah.'o Jacobs does not discuss the possibility that this proem is only secondarily related to Abraham. In addition, the same verse from Qohelet is applied to Jacob" and Joseph,'2 while the additional proof he cites for this tradition (Proverbs 10:8) is applied in the Mekhilta to Moses.'3 While these texts do not substantially undermine his central theses, they do call for a more subtle use of such terms as "exegetical tradition" and their development.14 In general, his use of supporting material creates 9.

Likewise, the proem based on Song of Songs 8:8 to which he devotes chapter 6 appears in Song of Songs Rabbah not as a proem at all but as a petira. It is not clear if this change in genre affects his argument.</page><page sequence="7">THE MIDRASHIC PROCESS 101 a chronological cocktail, citing with little distinction texts from Tanhuma, Avot d'Rabbi Natan, and Midrash Psalms as proof merely by stating that they "presumably draw their material from earlier sources" (p. 99). This attitude toward chronology does not permit the author to engage in any diachronic study of the development and transmission of the traditions he discusses. This same weakness can be seen in his final chapter, "Elements of Near-Eastern Mythology in Rabbinic Aggadah." Various authors have pointed out that rabbinic texts remythologize the Bible." In his attempt to show that "the rabbis exhibit a remarkable degree of accuracy in associating their store of mythological traditions with the fleeting, and often obscure references in biblical literature" (p. 155) he at times greatly exaggerates. For example, in discussing the Ugaritic mythological texts of the primordial struggle between the Creator and the genius of the sea, Yam, he states that "Rav was not only familiar with the cosmogonic event to which the biblical author alludes (Job 26:12) he actually employs an epithet for the genius of the sea, for which there is no counterpart in biblical sources, but which is comparable with the Ugaritic ZBL YM, ' tvt 1v, 'Prince of the sea' "(p. 155).16 For some reason he has forgotten to mention the fact that this epithet (sar sel) is a ubiquitous rabbinic term for designating the celestial powers of the nations and the natural world."7 He attempts to strengthen his argument that "from Palestinian Midrashim it is clear that the early myth presupposed by the biblical text was known among the early rabbinic exegetes" (p. 156) by citing as proof the use of a particular verb for God's trampling upon the seas (0a) "which does not occur in biblical allusions to this event, but which has an exact parallel in the Enuma Elish epic, where the cognate root, KABASU is used" (p. 156). However, the text he cites as proof appears in an anonymous midrash in Tanhuma and Numbers Rabbah! What are we to understand from such parallelomania?"8 Not only are these two collections by no means examples 15.
