<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE by GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN I Recent decades have seen a flowering of research into the political tradi- tion and culture of the Jewish people. It seems appropriate, therefore, to undertake an investigation of key rabbinic discussions of a central biblical and historical institution: the monarchy. This study opens with a close read- ing of the sources and attempts to understand them in their conceptual and literary contexts, moves on to a consideration of possible historical contexts and repercussions, and concludes with some reflections on the relation of our topic to the messianic element in Israel's faith. A Discussion of monarchy as a divine imperative first emerges among the sages of the mid-second century. The scriptural foci of the discussion are Deuteronomy 17 and 1 Samuel 8 (the story of the begrudged establishment of the monarchy by the prophet Samuel), though the exact relationship of rabbinic opinion to these scriptural bases is characteristically unclear. The tannaitic midrash reads:' 1. Louis Finkelstein, ed., Sifre to Deuteronomy (Berlin, 1939), section 156, p. 208. 15</page><page sequence="2">16 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN And you shall say, I will set a king over me: R. Nehorai says: This is to Israel's discredit, as it says: "... for they have not rejected you but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them."2 Said R. Judah: But is it not a command of the Torah that they should request a king, for it says: ". . . you shall surely place a king over you"!3 Why then were they punished in Samuel's time? Because they rushed matters. Like all the nations that are around me: R. Nehorai says: They sought a king to lead them to idolatry, for it says: ".. that we also may be like all the other nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles."4 R. Nehorai's attitude is straightforward as regards biblical origins and ideology alike. Deuteronomy 17 does not command that a monarch be crowned but rather implies (as traditional plain sense interpreters and mod- ern translators indicate alike) that the people are free to establish a mon- archy if they so choose; for the major burden of Deuteronomy 17 is actually, according to R. Nehorai, prophetic, disapproving prediction. This is made explicit when God describes the popular demand for a first king at the time of Samuel as a rejection of Himself-a betrayal of Israel's vocation. R. Nehorai then simply describes this rejection of the divine kingship in its most concrete extreme form-idolatry, claiming that what moved the popu- lace was not merely the desire for political and governmental restructuring but rather the urge to have done with the ideological base of Israelite soci- ety-the worship of God alone. R. Nehorai's prooftext is 1 Samuel 8:20, but he may well have recalled that God's first response to the popular clamor not only assured Samuel that He Himself was being rejected but explained this rejection as merely another instance of traditional Israelite idolatrous ingratitude ("according to all the works that they have done . .. in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods . .").5 R. Nehorai may also refer to cults fashioned around kings, both biblical and Hellenistic-Roman. (The corrosive implications of the historical event, incidentally, will be felt even in 2. 1 Samuel 8:7. 3. Deuteronomy 17:15. 4. 1 Samuel 8:20. 5. 1 Samuel 8:8, which follows immediately upon the verse with which he earlier needled R. Judah. Idolatry, then, sums up the desire "to be like all the nations"; having a king who will judge and war is the concrete, derivative, expression. See B.T. Sanhedrin 20b.</page><page sequence="3">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 17 the Davidic monarchy: Absalom's revolt, R. Nehorai taught, breaks out exactly forty years after the coronation of Saul.6) Be all this as it may, R. Nehorai does not seem to be condemning the specific motives of one coronation but rather is intent on claiming that human kingship is the political correlative of religious degeneration. This claim-whatever its antecedents in Second Commonwealth literature and ideology-clearly continues the biblical tradition that proclaims God alone as Israel's king, and sets the ideological tone for subsequent rabbinic dero- gation of monarchy. This basic ideological grounding distinguishes R. Nehorai's attitude from the report that Onkelos the proselyte had defended the observance of monarchical funerary rites for the Nasi R. Gamaliel, some decades earlier, by remarking that "Rabban Gamaliel is worth more than a hundred useless kings."7 Onkelos only argued that funerary rites had been observed for all the kings of Judah according to the prophet Jeremiah, and R. Gamaliel was not less worthy than many of these. Certainly there were other implications too. Monarchic status devolves on the patriarch, an assertion of great social significance; and Onkelos does hint that the Jews of Palestine at the beginning of the Common Era could do very well without kings or pretenders. But these contexts are pragmatic with little ideological timbre save the obvious relativizing of the monarchy. The tension between human monarchy and the Kingdom of Heaven remains the dominant motif of rabbinic opposition to the political institu- tion, whatever the specific historical stimuli may have been. In contrast to the aggadic view that conferred kingship on Abraham, R. Samuel b. Nah- man taught in the mid-fourth century that the patriarch refused that status: "Let the world not be without its [true] king."8 The later, anonymous Pales- tinian critique of the clamor for a monarch similarly embroidered on the 6. B.T. Temurah 15b, given in the name of R. Joshua (see on!); similarly in Seder 'Olam, chapter 14 (Medieval Jewish Chronicles, ed. Adolf Neubauer, 2 vols. [Oxford, 1887], 2: 45). 7. Semabot, ed.

BLIDSTEIN biblical claim that human kingship was a betrayal of Israel's fealty to God, a preferral of a mortal over the divine. This foolish choice, the rabbis teach, plunges the people into the maelstrom of human political history with dire results, but the tragic sorrows of Israel's career are merely the predictable outcome of this profoundly ideological blunder. The rabbis say: God said to Israel: 'I planned that you should be free from kings' [lit. 'kingships']. Whence this? As it is said, A wild ass used to the wil- derness (Jer. II, 24); 'just as the wild ass grows up in the wilderness and has no fear of man, so too I planned that you should have no fear of kings; but you did not desire so, but, That snuffeth up the wind in her desire (ib.), and "wind" is nothing but kingship.' Whence this? As it is said, And, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea (Dan. VII, 2). God said: 'Should you assert that I do not know that in the end you will forsake Me, already long ago have I forewarned [you] through Moses and said to him: "Seeing that in the end they will ask for a mortal king, let them appoint one of their own as a king, not a foreigner,"' Whence this? From what we have read in the context, And Shalt Say: I Will Set a King Over Me, etc. (XVII, 14). The Rabbis say: When kings arose over Israel and began to enslave them, God exclaimed: 'Did you not forsake Me and seek kings for yourselves?' Hence the force of, I Will Set a King Over Me. The Rabbis say: Whosoever puts his trust in flesh and blood passes away and his patronage also passes away, as it is said, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help (ib. CXLVI, 3). What follows on this verse? His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust (ib. 4). God said: 'Although they know that man is nought, yet they forsake My glory and say: "Set a king over us." Why do you ask for a king? By your life, in the end you will learn to your cost what you will have to suffer from your king.' Whence this? As it is said, All their kings are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me (Hos. VII, 7). I Will Set a King Over Me. The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He, said: 'In this world you asked for kings, and kings arose in Israel and caused you to fall by the sword.' Saul caused them to fall on Mount Gilboa. Whence this? And the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines (I Sam. XXXI, I). David brought about a plague, as it is said, So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel (II Sam. XXIV, 15). Ahab was the cause of the withholding of rain from them [Israel], as it is said, There shall not be dew nor rain these years, etc. (I Kings XVII, I). Zedekiah was the cause of the destruction of the Temple. When Israel saw what befell them on account of their kings they all began to cry out: 'We do not desire a king, we desire our first king,' [as it is said], For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King; He will save us (Isa. XXXIII, 22). Whereupon God replied: 'By your life, I will do so,'</page><page sequence="5">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 19 Whence this? For it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth, etc. (Zech. XIV, 9).9 The geonic midrash, too, picks up this motif, insisting that at first "God did not give them over to kings, nobles, or leaders to lead them but rather kept His presence among them and aided them in their every need."'1 We may surmise that the conflict between a monarchic exilarchate and the rab- binic gaonate provides the historical context for this last midrashic rejection of human political authority. Yet it is also the case that the terms of the geonic assertion and its rejection of political institutionalization have a long pedigree, going back to talmudic and biblical times. Whether the adoption of this ideology was a self-serving device or a reflection of a deeply held con- viction-or, most likely, both-is a different question. B In contrast to R. Nehorai's condemnation, R. Judah taught that Israel was commanded to establish a monarchy." This command is predicated on 9. Deuteronomy Rabbah 5: 8-11; translated by J. Rabinowitz (London, 1939), pp. 109-13. The sheer quantity and concentration of antimonarchic material in this collection is noteworthy from the point of view of literary history. As my discussion indicates, I do not think that these sentiments parallel the Hellenistic antimonarchic attitudes collated by E. E. Halevi, "The King's Law" [Hebrew], Tarbiz 38 (1968-9): 225-30. 10. Midrash pitron torah, ed. E. E. Urbach (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 333-34. I ought mention, at this point, one final, rather inscrutable text, on the subject of the tension of Heavenly and Terrestrial in our context. The Palestinian Talmud (Sanhedrin, chap. 2, end) tells of a fourth century Samaritan who twitted (?) a rabbi: "See what it says, 'You shall place a king over you.' It doesn't say I (i.e., God) will put a king over you, but you, you will make a king for your- selves." Is the Samaritan taking an exegetical poke at the rabbi by pointing out that designation of a king is in the people's hands-the view taught by Samaritan biblical history (at least according to The Samaritan Chronicle I, ed. John Macdonald [Berlin, 1969], pp. 101-2)? That the appointments of both Saul and David did not have divine approval (see John Macdonald, Theology of the Samaritans [London, 1964], p. 18)? Or ought the comment be read in its histori- cal context as a gibe at the pretensions of the Davidic Patriarchs, who had recently shifted the halakhah to an anti-Samaritan position (according to Gedaliah Allon, Toledot ha-yehudim, 2 vols. [Tel-Aviv, 1961], 2: 251)? Indeed the talmudic chapter closed by this anecdote is replete with tales of conflict between sages and Patriarchs, as S. D. Goitein, "The Attitudes Towards Government in Islam and Judaism" [Hebrew], Tarbiz 19 (1948): 155, has pointed out. 11. See n. 1. My translation reflects the natural reading, where R. Judah responds to R. Nehorai and then must counter the dilemma raised by 1 Samuel. It is also possible to translate (in somewhat forced fashion): ". . . since it is a mipvah to appoint a king, . . . why were they punished?" R. Judah's comment would then derive from a discussion of the Samuel texts, and it will have been the editor who produced the appearance of a debate. The first reading is much sounder and is also supported by Tosefta Sanhedrin 4:5, ed. M. S. Zuckermandel, 2d ed. (Jeru- salem, 1937), p. 421.</page><page sequence="6">20 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN Deuteronomy 17:15, though it is unclear whether the duplication of the verb SYM'2 or the nonconditional form of the sentence (compared with v. 14) is at the root of this exegesis, or for that matter-whether the Bible is here a source for an exegete, a prop for an eisegete, or an embarrassment for an ideologue. A second biblical instance is, however, a glaring embarrassment: R. Judah must excuse the obvious divine disapproval of Israel's request of Samuel as a response to the form or timing of the people's petition but not as an indication that kingship in itself is anything but a divine command. We shall return to R. Judah's reading of the Samuel story; first we shall focus on other tannaitic exegetic activities in support of monarchy. A frequently cited baraita anchors the monarchy in scriptural ground. Here, R. Judah argues that establishment of the monarchy is to precede the extermination of the Amalekites on the basis of a midrashic reading of Exo- dus 17:16: "When a king sits on the Lord's throne-then will you extermi- nate the Amalekite."'3 Though R. Judah's immediate interest is the sequence of these events, the idea of a commanded monarchy is an inevi- table element in this scriptural scenario. It is therefore significant to note the midrashic use to which this verse had been put by earlier sages. R. Joshua had read the same phrase, some time between the Temple's destruction and the Bar Kochba revolt, thus: "When God will sit on His throne and His kingship is established-at that time will the Lord war on Amalek." Irre- spective of whether "His kingship" also implies a human political correla- tive, it seems clear that R. Joshua read Exodus 17:16 as eschatological. R. Joshua describes a time not very different from that predicted by his con- temporary R. Eliezer: "When will their name be blotted out? When idolatry is uprooted along with its devotees, when the Lord is alone in the world and His kingdom is forever-then the Lord will go out and war on those people." R. Judah, now, has adopted the understanding of "the Lord's throne" as a reference to kingship, but has shifted its context and subject: from divine kingship to a human king, from the eschatological to the halakhic and the historical-the history of Saul and David and, perhaps, contemporary Jewish history. Yet he has also appropriated the resonance of the original biblical statement read midrashically; the king sits on the Lord's throne and fights the Lord's war.14 12.

According to Deuteronomy 1:7 the people are to enter and occupy the land up to Lebanon; the tannaitic midrash reads the term as a symbol: "when you enter the land you are to appoint a king and build the Temple," demonstrating that "Lebanon" can mean both monarchy and sanctuary. Now the midrashic use of Lebanon for the Temple has been dat- ed to R. Yohanan b. Zakkai, and it is likely that its use to signify kingship as well (in a related tannaitic text, this use is indeed found as an explicit adden- dum to its meaning as Temple) reflects the same wave of exegetic activity represented in the rereading of Exodus 17:16.'5 Can the same phenomenon be detected in the tannaitic midrash to Deuteronomy 17? R. Judah's reference to Deuteronomy 17:15 is given as part of his discussion with R. Nehorai as to the implications of the previous verse 14. The formal exegesis of v. 15 is presented in Sifre as follows: Som tasim. If he dies, appoint another to succeed him ... Another explanation, som tasim: This is a positive command.... Although the first comment cited certainly takes a positive attitude toward the monarchy by providing for its continuity, it is only the second explanation that reads Deuteronomy 17:15 as a halakhic imperative to establish a monarchy. Does this reflect a deliberate hardening of the exege- tical line consonant with R. Judah's general attitude and parallel to the other midrashic phenomena noted above?'6 editions) give: "when the king sits," which is doubtless a correction based on R. Judah's mid- rash as found in Sifre and Talmud (B. T. Sanhedrin 20b). Thirteenth century Midrash Ha- Gadol, ed., Mordecai Margaliot (Jerusalem, 1956), p. 345, in fact derives R. Judah's view from R. Joshua. Mekhilta de-Rashbi, ed. J. N. Epstein and E. Z. Melamed (Jerusalem, 1955), p. 126, line 28, diplomatically omits the subject of the phrase altogether! R. Eliezer: Mekhilta de-RI, lines 4-7.

Sifre, Deuteronomy, sec. 157, p. 208, line 13; p. 209, line 5. Interestingly, M. Sanhedrin 2:5 derives the duty of reverence of kings from this verse (not, as does Sifre, p. 209 lines 1-4, from the second use of tasim in Deut. 17:15); yet since even that phrase can sustain a number of homilies, I do not believe that the Mishnah intends to reject the imperative of appointing a king. True, the Mishnah does not list the requirement-but neither does it list the requirement of appointing a Sanhedrin. But cf. Ze'ev (Wilhelm) Bacher, 'Aggadot ha-tanna'im, 3 vols. (Ber- lin, 1922), vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 141, n. 13.</page><page sequence="8">22 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN C Since R. Judah asserts that Israel is commanded to appoint a king, he must confront the antimonarchic stance of the Book of Samuel, which rep- resents God's condemnation of the popular desire for a king. A reply to this antimonarchic inference was forthcoming, "Why then were they punished in Samuel's time? Because they rushed matters." This explanation is, however, hard to fathom. How did the Israelites rush matters? Contemporaries of R. Judah (equally confident that the monarchy itself was not the subject of divine disapproval) suggested other, tangential causes for God's displeasure. These do not shed light on the claim that the Israelites rushed matters."7 A number of possible interpretations do suggest themselves, though none are decisively convincing. Louis Ginzberg has compared the accusa- tion placed in the prophet Samuel's mouth by pseudo-Philo: "Behold now I see that there is not yet for us the time of a perpetual kingdom, nor of build- ing the house of the Lord our God, inasmuch as they desire a king before the time," and has understood R. Judah to be similarly condemning the people for asking for a king before the Temple had been erected.'8 Now, the sequence in which monarchy and sanctuary were to be established was indeed a matter of tannaitic discussion and even debate as we shall see, and it may be possible to read R. Judah in that context. But if pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities are to instruct (or at least stimulate) us, it must be said that Ginzberg's understanding of pseudo-Philo is incorrect. Pseudo-Philo is not concerned at all with the impropriety of having a king before the Temple is built. Pseudo-Philo in fact condemns the people for requesting a king before the determined time, that is, the time predetermined for the establish- ment of the eternal Davidic kingdom. Both the text cited by Ginzberg and 17. Sanhedrin 20b; Tosefta Sanhedrin 4:5, p. 421; Midrash Tanna'im, ed. David Hoffmann (Berlin, 1908), p. 104. An alternative cause for God's displeasure is the impropriety of the com- moner's motivation as opposed to that of the elders. This view is attributed by the Tosefta and some Talmud MSS to R. Eleazar b. R. Jose, and by other MSS of the Talmud to R. Eleazar b. Zadok (Diqduqei soferim, ad loc.), sages who lived at or after the time of R. Judah. Some MSS also eliminate the talmudic tanya, so that this view literally follows that of R. Nehorai, and is not an independent, earlier, source. Finkelstein's attempt (in the note to his edition of Sifre, line 7) to identify R. Judah with this view is puzzling since nothing is there said about the common- ers speaking before (i.e., "rushing") the elders. Note also Bacher, 'Aggadot, yet see his alterna- tive explanation, p. 152, n. 18. See also Kimhi to 1 Samuel 8:5. 18. Louis Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 7 vols.

Judah to con- form to this perspective. It may be more sensible to understand him to mean that the people acted hastily, on the spur of the moment, much as Josephus (moved of course by a disapproval of monarchy not shared by R. Judah) had written decades before.20 Actually, though, Ginzberg's suggestion ought to be reconsidered on its own terms, and indeed developed. Second century sages, and indeed R. Judah himself, do discuss the question of the sequence in which monarchy and sanctuary are to be established. Moreover, the terminology employed in this discussion is strikingly similar to the phrase rendered until now, "to rush matters.'"2 Perhaps, then, our baraita espouses the view that Temple ought to have preceded monarchy? Let us now examine, therefore, the dis- cussion in question, which comprises in fact a significant source for the study of tannaitic attitudes toward monarchy. This baraita is also found in the Sifre and is cited frequently in other rabbinic collections:22 R. Judah says: Three commands devolved on Israel when they entered the land: to appoint a king, to build the Temple, and to eradicate the Amalekites. Now I don't know which precedes which .. . But Scripture teaches, ". . . the hand upon the throne of the Lord: the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation," that is to say that you eradicate the Amalekites when a king sits on the throne of the Lord. ... Now I still don't know which precedes: building the Temple or eradicating the Amalekites. But Scripture teaches, "But when you go over the Jordan and you dwell in the land which the Lord your God gives you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your 19. Thus: ".. . go anoint him whom I shall tell thee, for the time is fulfilled wherein his kingdom shall come" (59:1, Montague R. James, trans., Biblical Antiquities of Philo [London, 1917], p. 231). See Charles Perrot and Pierre-Maurice Bogaert, Pseudo-Philon: Les Antiquitis Bibliques, 2 vols. (Paris, 1976), 2: 226-27. For the dating (70-132 C.E.) and provenance (Pales- tine) of pseudo-Philo, see Louis H. Feldman's "Prolegomenon" to the New York, 1971 reissue of Charles's edition, pp. XXII-XXXI. 20.

BLIDSTEIN enemies round about . . . then it shall come to pass that the place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell there .. ."23 This baraita argues then for the following sequence (which differs, we note, from the order in which these duties are listed at the very outset!):24 king, Amalekites, Temple. This sequence is established by painstaking exegesis, and the baraita also proceeds to cite 1 Samuel 7:1-2 as further proof that the commanded wars precede the building of the Temple (and as conclusive his- torical-though not normative-proof that kingship precedes them both?).25 These duties oblige Israel, R. Judah declares, "from the time they enter the land," that is-immediately. This point too is not mere literary flourish. J. N. Epstein has shown that the schools of R. Akiba and R. Ishmael differed on just this point: R. Ishmael deferred fulfillment of many similar imperatives till after the conquest, while R. Akiba imposed them immediately upon entry into the land. Epstein's analysis shows that even our first baraita's literary frame is phrased in the terminology used as code for immediate as over against deferred commands.26 But these two points relating to timing and sequence are clearly at cross- purposes with the explanations given earlier for the Samuel-Saul incident. Here, "king" clearly precedes "Temple"; should we argue that Sifre, sec. 156 advocates the opposing point of view? Here, R. Judah asserts that these imperatives devolve immediately; does the apologist of Sifre, sec. 156 claim that monarchy was appropriate only at a later point in time, or even that Israel ought have waited for its Davidic king? One could, of course, reduce our texts to their components and argue for separate authorship of the dif- ferent segments; indeed, textual seams may still be discerned and reopened.27 23. Exodus 17:16, and see at n. 14; Deuteronomy 12:10-11. Other proof texts follow, with further literary elaboration in B.T. Sanhedrin 20b. 24. That order (king, temple, Amalek) is also found in Tosefta, op. cit., and in R. Hananel's epitome at Sanhedrin 20b. Interestingly, Sifre, Deuteronomy, sec. 6, p. 14, spoke only of king and temple: does this reflect its exegetical base? Or an earlier tradition that did not yet include Amalek-which, when first added, went to the end of the line until conceptually integrated by the midrash before us? 25. The fact that Saul is commanded to war against Amalek immediately upon his acces- sion (1 Samuel 15:1-3) is not cited, indicating either a Davidic predilection or the fact that the midrash, at this point, considers the sequential priority of king-Amalek to be assured and is concerned only about the sequence of Amalek-Temple. 26. J. N. Epstein, Mevo'ot le-sifrut ha-tanna'im (Jerusalem, 1957), pp. 539-41. 27. Thus, the question, ". .. why were they punished... ?" and of course the reply, can be severed (rather crudely) from the opening statement of R. Judah and assigned to an anonymous speaker; while this statement does appear in Tosefta, op. cit., it is lacking at Sanhedrin 20b and of course in Sifre, sec. 67.</page><page sequence="11">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 25 However, I think it wisest to present the problem and allow for the general possibility of differing postures, rather than precisely to tailor the sources to suit the problematic contours that have appeared. Perhaps, indeed, undue haste is condemned even in the fulfillment of immediate imperatives. D An ostensibly tannaitic midrash, unearthed some seventy years ago by Solomon Schechter, supplies a dramatic (and anticipated?) contrast to the views we have just considered.28 The importance of this text was urged by Ginzberg in his Legends of the Jews,29 but there is even more to the matter than he noticed. Unto His habitation shall ye seek:30 This verse applies after the land has been conquered and settled. But per- haps it applies immediately upon entry into the land? Scripture teaches "And ye shall possess it and dwell therein.""' . . . The verse applies therefore after conquest and settlement . . . after you have conquered, taken possession, and settled-then build the Temple . . . demand a king, and eradicate the Amale- kite... Perhaps all this applies immediately upon entry into the land? Therefore Scripture teaches: "But when ye go over the Jordan and dwell in the land ... ."32 The Temple precedes kingship. This is reasonable: "awe" is predicated of heaven and "awe" is predicated of earth;33 the heavenly kingdom is spoken of and the earthly kingdom is spoken of. Now just as we find that awe of heaven precedes awe of the earthly, so does the kingdom of heaven precede the earthly kingdom ...

Scripture teaches: ". . . when the Lord ... hath given thee rest from thine enemies . . . in the land which the Lord ... hath given thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek . . ."34 Therefore, what is meant by "they have not rejected you but they have rejected me"? This teaches that they did not request a king for . .. but asked for . .. a king for themselves ... as it says, ". .. that we may be like the other nations."35 This passage presents us with a number of distinctive views. First, it polemicizes with and rejects the idea that the three national obligations with which we are familiar devolved on Israel immediately upon entry to the land. Most significantly, this rejected view is phrased in terminology identi- cal with the tannaitic materials considered earlier, thus confirming Epstein's analysis and demonstrating that the timing of these obligations was in fact an issue for tannaitic sages. Second, we find here an explicit tannaitic claim that building the Sanctu- ary was to have preceded the crowning of a king. This claim is based on both scriptural-ideological and scriptural-historical grounds. Historically, Isra- el's sin in asking a king of Samuel lay in the timing of the request; the "rejec- tion" of which God speaks does not refer to the desire to have a king (which our midrash, too, considers to be imperative) but to the attempt to establish the monarchy before the Temple had been built. It is impossible to state, of course, whether exegesis (tempered by commitment to the monarchy) led to this view as to the timing of these two imperatives or whether the already held view on timing urged the exegesis in question. More to the point of the text itself is the fact that it reads "rejection" of God in the fact that Israel expected the Temple's building to follow the establishment of the king- ship-a reading that follows literarily and conceptually (as to the historical development of the two views, we cannot say) from the scriptural- ideological argument presented at the outset: here the issue of Temple/king is translated into Heavenly Kingdom/human kingdom, with precedence (indeed, priority!) demanded appropriately for the divine. This argument has a tenuous scriptural connection at best; rather, we find a rare translation of halakhic structures into religious-ideological categories and a discussion of the internal dynamics of these legal obligations in terms of ideological pri- ority. The centrality of the ideological becomes even more apparent when 34. Deuteronomy 25:19. See n. 36. 35. 1 Samuel 8:5.</page><page sequence="13">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 27 we consider that a normative sequence Temple-king threatens the ideal quality of even the Davidic monarchy, which must now be explained (with no scriptural warrant at all!) as a deviation set in motion by the original sin of the monarchy of Saul! To return to our text again, the view that Israel ought to have waited to request a king until the Sanctuary had been built sits well with the midrashic view that these imperatives were not operative immediately upon entry to the land. Third, we see that the imperative quality of the monarchy was fostered not only by students of R. Akiba; here it is shared by R. Jonathan, a disciple of R. Ishmael, and is the basis for a discussion that otherwise accepts the attitudes of this school. And, if our text is correct, R. Jonathan adds a dis- tinctive point: though kingship precedes the Sanctuary, the Sanctuary pre- cedes Amalek, which is thus the last of our national duties imposed on the people.36 The following midrash may also be relevant to our topic:37 R. Simeon b. Yohai taught: ".. . they have rejected Me"-God said to Samuel, "they will reject three things in the future: the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of David, and the Temple." When did they reject all three? In the time of Rehoboam ... R. Simeon b. Menassiyah said: Israel will not see blessing3s until they request all three again, as it says: "Afterwards shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God and David their king and shall come trem- bling unto the Lord and His goodness in the end of days"39-"seek the Lord," that is the kingdom of heaven; "and David their king," that is the kingdom of David; ". .. the Lord and His good at the end of days," that is the Temple. R. Simeon b. Yohai's homily on 1 Samuel 8:7 teaches that Israel's sin lies in 36. It is difficult to see how Deuteronomy 25:19 supports the sequence Temple-Amalek. Does "inheritance" refer midrashically to the Temple, as in Mekhilta de-RI to Exodus 15:17 (p. 149)? That very midrash takes the "inheritance" of Deuteronomy 25:19 to mean the Land of Israel! Interestingly, the Munich MS to B.T. Sanhedrin 20b (Diqduqei soferim, note 50) takes the verses Deuteronomy 25:19-20 (in place of Deuteronomy 12:10-11) to demonstrate the sequence Amalek-Temple: first (v. 19) war on Amalek, then bring first fruits to the Temple (v. 20). Might this not be R. Jonathan's intention? But our text does read: "the Temple precedes Amalek"; cf. also Mekhilta de-RI, p. 150, lines 8-14. 37. Midrash Shemu'el, ed.

BLIDSTEIN the future, when by rejecting the Davidic dynasty, the tribes will reject the Lord as well and His Temple. Actually, R. Simeon (a contemporary of R. Judah and R. Nehorai) calls up a cluster of ideas and values, and it would be most difficult (and unnecessary?) to identify a single purpose behind this teaching. Certainly, R. Simeon operates within the concensus that saw Israel as commanded to request a monarch, with the result that the appeal to Samuel for a king could not be seen as impiety, a rejection of the Lord. The impiety, rather, must be sought-in somewhat strained fashion!-in the future. Interestingly, the rejection of the Lord thus located does not devolve from requesting a king but from despising one. It is by rejecting the Davidic mon- arch that Israel will express its rejection of God! If this irony is not merely accidental, ought we go one step further? Does an echo of impiety resound even in the request made of Samuel to provide a king before David could appear on the scene? Or is this echo of pseudo-Philo simply not to be heard? A second point ought also be noted, though here too we can at the most detect suggestive resonances. Does R. Simeon's prediction of threefold "rejection" reflect the notion of a threefold imperative? "Threes" are of course a favorite organizing device for the rabbis. But perhaps there is more to the matter. Two of the three items in each list are identical: King and Temple. The third item varies: here, the kingdom of heaven; there, eradica- tion of Amalek. If we do wish to press the parallelism, it can be argued that variation in this one item is not decisive, or even that establishment of the Heavenly Kingdom is symbolized elsewhere in tannaitic literature by the war with Amalek.40 R. Simeon b. Menassiah, a contemporary of R. Judah the Prince, drew a contemporary message from R. Simeon b. Yohai's homily. Israel's very redemption is conditional upon its once again seeking the divine and human king alike, and its Temple. (Clearly, then, Israel is not to be faulted for its monarchic yearning, though this is of course not the point at hand.) This extension of the historical homily hardly does it violence; it is like that which R. Simeon b. Yohai himself taught about the past with an awareness of the present. Indeed, regarding the yearning for the Temple, he told the people that thousands died in David's time because they did not strive to build the Temple and argued that his own age, which saw its Temple brought to ruin, would be punished even more severely if it did not properly beg for its resto- 40.

In the biblical story itself, thousands die in a plague brought on by David's mounting a census of the nation-not because they delayed building the Temple. The midrash, then, is clearly a tendentious homily. What is its point? II The student of tannaitic materials is always tempted to unearth their his- torical provenance; indeed in our case we face a virtual occupational hazard. What would be more natural than to note the Ushan origins of our sources and to claim that the halakhot before us, all replete with religio- nationalistic content, reflect the religio-nationalistic ambition and trauma that was the Bar-Kochba revolt? None are so naive any longer as to assert that the political event "caused" the norms in question; but ought we not perceive a correlation between normative discussion and political event? I believe that it is, in fact, quite reasonable to assert that the Bar-Kochba revolt and our sources, taken in the broadest sense, do cohere and even mutually illuminate each other. But it would be forcing upon these sources a weight far beyond the evidence at hand, were we to declare that the specifics of their concerns reflect rabbinic responses to issues at hand. Thus, it was probably no accident, nor the result of a purely immanent dynamic, that tannaim circa 140 C.E. circulated a doctrine teaching that Israel lay under a divine command to appoint a king, build a Temple, and eradicate Amalek. Each of these three components resonates compellingly in second century Jewish history: national independence, restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem, the defeat and annihilation of Rome-leading to the Kingdom of God. It is difficult to decide whether this doctrine reflects mid- rashic propaganda leading to the revolt, or rabbinic justification of its legiti- macy (and a pledge of faith to its smoldering remains) after its failure. In 41. Midrash Tehillim, ed. Solomon Buber (Vilna, 1891), p. 127, par. 4. See also Pesiqta Rabbati, ed. Meir Friedmann (Vienna, 1895), p. 6b; Midrash Shemu'el, p. 94; Mekhilta to Deuteronomy, p. 191, lines 7-13, and n. 54 below. It would seem significant that Midrash Tehillim speaks of "the thousands who fell in battle," though the biblical text speaks of a "plague." Actually, rabbinic texts elsewhere indicate that "plagues" may be used as code for "war" (see Allon, Toledot, 2: 42-43).</page><page sequence="16">30 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN either case, we see the emergence of a firm and normative doctrine which either reworks older exegesis or bends verses to its need. It is very doubtful that R. Judah and his contemporaries were intent on defining the obliga- tions of those Israelites who first crossed the Jordan alone; both terminol- ogy and tannaitic texts42 alike lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with the permanent normative structure of Judaism as these tannaim defined it. (At the same time, this same generation of tannaim also opens a broad dis- cussion of the Samuel-Saul episode whose major thrust is to argue the legiti- macy of a request for a human king.43) We may also note the inner cohesion of these three imperatives, which give the impression of being a statement of public policy rather than a haphazard collection of goals.44 Now, if this correlation of midrash and event is correct, then we have done much more than add a new dimension to a rabbinic text. Rather, it is the event that is illuminated, or at least the way the event was perceived by students of a man active at its center. If the Bar-Kochba revolt provided the stimulus for this normative crystallization, then it is equally clear that this legitimating crystallization of divine imperatives (king, Amalek, Temple) provides an interpretative key to what moved the leaders of the revolt and provided the impetus for their actions. Military and political goals will then be interpreted in religious messianic terms. It is much more risky, however, to claim a substantive correlation between political and'social goals and the specifics of tannaitic discussion surrounding the issue of monarchy. The methodological wariness appropri- ate to this enterprise in general is reinforced, in our case, by the fact that much of this discussion can be taken to support a variety of different (and differing!) positions on the social and political questions at hand. Given our fragmentary state of knowledge, we cannot argue with much conviction for any specific correlation, though the possibilities are tantalizing indeed. R. Nehorai, we recall, took a dim view of the Israelite request for a king, and it is most likely that he did not think that Israel was commanded to have one. Ought this be translated into condemnation of a revolt for political independence mounted by a messianic pretender? It is possible, even likely, 42. See Tosefta Sanhedrin 4:5, p. 421, where normative conclusions are drawn from the baraita; B.T. Kiddushin 38a (bottom). 43. See n. 17, above. 44.

R. Nehorai disdains earthly ambition in general ("I would ignore all trades and teach my son Torah alone, for a man enjoys its fruits in this world and its reward in the next . .")45 and grounds his opposi- tion to monarchy on religious grounds, claiming it is a rejection of the divine king. As such, he stands squarely within a hoary biblical tradition. Again, this orientation would cohere well with opposition to Bar-Kochba, but we do not know whether this was in fact the case. It is possible that his state- ments reflected abstract concern and biblical study, or that some other social situation called them forth. We must admit, however, that statements of political and religious ideology made in the decades immediately follow- ing the revolt would doubtless have been heard then as a response to this major, shattering historical moment. It is difficult to imagine anyone talking in 150 C.E. about Israel's search for a king in the distant past who was not painfully aware of the more recent attempt and did not realize that his dis- cussion implied an attitude toward this attempt or toward the public policy that his people ought adopt in the future. R. Judah had declared firmly for the kingship. But confronted by the biblical disapproval of Israel's request of Samuel, he admitted that it was wrong "to rush." Can this admission be taken as a critique of the historical events of some decades back? Can we claim that R. Judah approved of the thrust for political independence in principle, but took a critical view (aided by hindsight, of course) of its progress in tactical terms?46 That he thought matters had proceeded precipitously or in unwise sequence? That the peo- ple's ill-conceived fulfillment of the divine imperative led to God's rejection of their efforts-thus providing a theologically valid rationale for the Bar- Kochba debacle? We simply do not have enough corroborating facts to allow us to argue so speculatively. Until such data are developed, it is more responsible to read R. Judah as simply engaged in a defense of the main body of his doctrine by surrendering its weak flanks. The other tannaitic attempts to save the idea of monarchy while admitting the justice of God's disapproval in 1 Samuel ought be read in similar fashion. Moralistic- 45. M. Kiddushin 4:14. 46. R.

BLIDSTEIN religious flaws are found in the people's behavior; and if there is any lesson to be learned, it is moral not historical (in the narrow sense). If the common- ers are faulted for having spoken in a manner different from that of the elders of the people, the point is to teach something about the deference appropriate to elders and the misfortune that follows when commoners speak out on their own, or to teach something about the proper goals of Jewish social institutions, not to reflect on the reasons for the failure of the Bar-Kochba revolt. Until more data are developed, we can only repeat this point with regard to another issue, the sequence in which the three national imperatives are to be achieved. Here too it is most tantalizing to consider the various ways in which the tannaitic discussion can be appropriated for historical use. It must be emphasized, therefore, that application of this discussion to the historical episode of the revolt is speculative; and the very fact that a given tannaitic position can be used to buttress differing political attitudes indicates that we ought to be wary of facile historicizations of these teachings. Needless to say, though, these teachings ought be probed. We may safely assume, as I have already indicated, that the statement that Israel was commanded to fulfill three imperatives (kingship, Amalek, Temple) when they crossed into the land does not refer to the singular his- torical period described by the book of Joshua alone, but rather means that these standing imperatives were activated at that point and remain in force from that time on. This understanding is further underscored by the tannai- tic discussion as to the proper sequence in which the imperatives are to be tackled and fulfilled, a discussion much more appropriate to the problem- atics of an ongoing imperative. Yet this very question of sequence is most worthy of note in its own right. Why assume that there is a proper sequence at all? Perhaps the people is to fulfill these imperatives in any order it sees fit or finds practicable? The idea of a prescribed sequence is quite far-reaching; it does not merely recommend the sequence likely to be successful but requires that a specific order of events be achieved and restrains the people from fulfilling these commands if the sequence will thereby be violated: if a king is to be appointed before the Temple is built, then the Temple may not be built until that first event takes place. It is true that questions of sequence are not foreign to tannaitic thought. Yet the scope of such questions is usu- ally much more restricted; the utilization of this restrictive category in mat- ters of such scope and complexity as ours ought not be taken for granted.47 47. Issues of sequence are raised primarily in connection with the proper order of Temple ritual.</page><page sequence="19">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 33 Seen this way, the question of sequence suggests that questions of policy or tactics are at stake. Our difficulty, of course, is that we are not yet able to define which alternatives are implied by the different positions on sequence, or even to make certain progress in defining the realm in which this discus- sion moves. What does it mean to debate whether kingship must precede the Temple? If interpreted in historical and political terms, a great deal indeed; too much in fact! We have seen that each sequence (king-Temple; Temple-king) found its adherents. But the implications of these abstractions are unclear. Take, for example, the requirement that political autonomy (kingship) pre- cedes the building of the Temple. Is this a rabbinic call to arms, a proclama- tion that political and military steps must be taken so as to move the people toward redemption? Or is it just the reverse, a rabbinic rejection of attempts at reorganizing temple worship since political autonomy was not yet at hand and the enemy certainly not vanquished? (The requirement that Amalek be destroyed before the Temple can be built translates easily into this same pattern.) The opposing position lends itself to a similar set of possibilities: does the sequence Temple-king reflect a rabbinical call for active attempts to rebuild the Temple, or a rabbinical attempt to curtail monarchic- messianic enthusiasm? The first half of the second century C.E. could easily provide the historical stage upon which any of these scenarios could be mounted; Bar-Kochba, Rome, a destroyed Temple-here is the obvious cast of characters to play the biblical roles of king,48 Amalek, Temple. What we do not know-if we choose the historical option-is which rabbinic view represents which social-political position; and this very open-endedness ought introduce an element of caution into the enterprise. My own advice notwithstanding, we can press our historical speculation a bit further, at least far enough to consider some additional, suggestive refinements of the basic alternatives outlined above. Let us first stress that the restoration of the Temple and its cult was a central driving force behind the revolt led by Bar-Kochba. Irrespective of whether the numismatic evi- dence supports the claim that Jews actually conquered Jerusalem or not, the Bar-Kochba coins do demonstrate that the liberation of the city was a cru- cial passion; it is impossible to treat the city as a national symbol without 48. The actual status granted Bar Kochba is a matter of discussion (cf. G. Allon, Toledot, pp. 33ff., and in Samuel Yeivin, Milhemet Bar Kokhba, 2d ed. (Jerusalem, 1957), p. 77; Emil Schurer, History of the Jewish People, ed. Geza Vermes, 2 vols. to date (Edinburgh, 1973), 1: 543, but even the term nasi has monarchic overtones and R. Akiba, for one, is cited (P.T. Ta'an- it 68d) as declaring Bar-Kochba to be "King Messiah."</page><page sequence="20">34 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN acknowledging the role of the Temple. Some coins, moreover, also designate a high priest, indicating the prominence which this class was expected to recapture. Chrysostom even tells of the beginnings of Temple construction by the rebels-a testimony to how the revolt was perceived, if not to actual events.49 Jewish sources also support this close association. R. Simeon b. Eleazar's advice: "If lads tell you, 'Build the Temple,' don't listen to them; but if elders tell you 'Destroy the Temple,' do listen to them, because the building of lads is destruction but the destruction of elders is building," has been taken as a critique of the hot-headed revolt against Rome, and it ought be noted that the specific event in question is the building of the Temple.so The construction of the Temple is also linked to the revolt by those who approved of the attempt. We have already seen how R. Simeon b. Yohai claimed that the epidemic during David's reign was due to the absence of attempts at building the Temple, a homily explicated by another tanna for its contemporary relevance. The following midrash should also be consi- dered in the same perspective:5' A Psalm and song at the dedication. Just see! Solomon builds the House, and yet it is called after the name of David! Indeed David deserved to build it. For a certain reason, however [which will be stated presently], he was not allowed to build it. Even though he had intended to build it, Nathan the prophet came and in the name of God said to him, "Thou shalt not build a House for Me." "Why not?" "Because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth before Me." When David heard this, he grew afraid, saying: "Behold, I am deemed unfit to build the Temple." According to R. Judah bar Il'a'i, the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: "David, be not afraid. As thou livest, in My sight thou art deemed as innocent in shedding the blood of the nations thou didst vanquish as in shedding the blood of a gazelle or of a hart." In the words 49. G. Allon, Toledot, pp. 34-38; Schurer, History, pp. 545-46 and n. 145. Allon's reading of "Jerusalem" as symbolic of the constitutional role of the people as over against the leader- ship (pp. 37-38) is not convincing. See also G. W. Bowerstock, "A Roman Perspective on the Bar Kochba War," in W. S. Green, ed., Approaches to Ancient Judaism, 2 (Missoula, Mont., 1980), pp. 136-37. 50.

Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth." According to another tradition, the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: "As thou livest, in My sight all the blood thou didst shed is deemed as offerings." For, as R. Simeon ben Yohai says, in the words "thou hast shed much blood upon the earth before Me," the phrase "before Me" hints at offerings, as in the verse "And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord." David said: If Thou so deemest, then why may I not build the House? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: If thou shouldst build it, it will endure and never be destroyed. According to the plain sense of the biblical text, David was declared unfit to build the Temple because of the blood he had spilled-in wars and perhaps in his personal life. R. Judah and R. Simeon declare that this could not be the real reason for David's disqualification, for his spilling of blood was either necessary and innocent, or positively virtuous, a veritable act of piety. The modulated difference between these two views is of course very interest- ing, as Wm. Braude points out. But we want to know what impelled both tannaim to play so loosely with the biblical narrative. Were they merely con- cerned with the image of the historical David? With that image as it reflected on the contemporary patriarchate? Or was the issue the seeming impropriety of a warrior-king building the Temple? Nathan's words to David could cer- tainly signify divine displeasure with a Temple erected on the foundations of bloody revolt, undermining a fundamental legitimating motive of the rebels. The tannaitic midrash, then, stands the prophetic word on its head: the blood shed by David is either innocent or is actually virtuous. Because he warred, David is entitled to build God's House! The possible implications of this turnabout are obvious. These tannaitic homilies are Ushan, reflecting the views of the post-Bar- Kochba generation-a generation that would either justify the revolt, con- demn it, or do both. R. Simeon b. Yohai's homily, teaching that many of David's people died because they did not make a significant effort to build the Temple, might then be a balanced view of the career of the revolt: it was a good and justifiable idea, but was destined to fail because of its misplaced priorities. Thus we have both a program for the future and a theodicy of the past. Another, anonymous (tannaitic) critique of a similar sort can be mar- shalled. "The Sabbath will never disappear from Israel. For all those things for which Israel laid down its life remained hers. And those things for which</page><page sequence="22">36 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN Israel did not lay down its life, did not. Sabbath, circumcision, the study of Torah, and immersion: for these Israel gave its life and these survive. [But] the Temple, civil jurisprudiction, Sabbatical and Jubilee years, for which Israel did not give its life, do not.""52 The major concern is to urge the value of self-sacrifice, which ironically issues in survival. But the cited example faults the people for not making sufficient sacrifices to save and then restore the Temple. We see then that the attitude toward the Temple could become an issue, a spring board for a critique. Might not the sequence: Temple- king, reflect a similar critique and theodicy? The more popular sequence: king-Temple, would then be the position of those who saw no fault in the course of the revolt as it took place. Given the present state of our historical knowledge and the uncertainties which do lurk behind our texts, we ought treat the suggestions just made as hypotheses, heuristic devices, but no more. Even a relatively strong indica- tor, R. Simeon b. Yohai's claim that Israelite reluctance to found the Tem- ple caused many deaths, cannot be taken as evidence of his critique- apologia of the Bar-Kochba defeat until we know whether the rebels took Jerusalem or missed the opportunity to do so, and whether they could be accused of foregoing the option of sacrificing to the Lord. The midrashic text ought focus our attention on these questions-it cannot answer them. We may have a spectrum of opinion ranged on the continuum of Temple- centeredness, beginning with R. Simeon's own approval of a blood-stained warrior as most worthy of building the Temple and culminating in the demand that Temple precede king much as Heaven precedes Earth. Both this last assertion and the sequence it supports are anonymous, incidentally, and are found in a fragment of uncertain date and history. This position may not be a reflection on a past of unknown immediacy, then, but a resolu- tion for the future. The singular sequence Temple-king indeed reappears in a Palestinian discussion of the fourth century, which E. E. Urbach has con- nected to rabbinic discussion of the Emperor Julian's offer to allow recon- struction of the Temple, the question thus being whether the Temple may be built before political autonomy is sought.53 It is certainly possible that our texts argue for a similar policy, whether in connection with a concrete his- 52. Mekhilta de-RI, p. 343. Significantly, this same generalization is attributed to R. Simeon b. Eleazar, but the specifics, e.g., Temple, are omited (B.T. Shabbat 103a, and see at note 50, above). 53.

Urbach, "The Edict of Cyrus in Rabbinic Perspective" [Hebrew], Molad 19 (1961): 373, n. 15.</page><page sequence="23">MONARCHIC IMPERATIVE IN RABBINIC PERSPECTIVE 37 torical opportunity or simply as a blueprint for a wiser future. It is certainly worth noting, in any case, that many of these midrashic texts urge redou- bled prayers for a restored Temple: does this indicate that the problem is grounded in liturgical questions, or that an originally activistic thrust has been canalized into ritual, where it will be preserved but temporarily defused?54 Similar questions ought be asked of another debate touched on in our discussion, one that possibly preceded the revolt. We have noted that the school of R. Akiba assumed that Israel was obliged to take a king immedi- ately upon its entry to the land, while the school of R. Ishmael rejected this timetable. It is not at all difficult to fit the Akiban schedule into an ideology that pressed for quick achievement of political autonomy and saw political subordination as religiously insufferable. Yet we must ask, again, whether the translation of exegetical debate into contemporary historical terms and into this specific historical concern is justified. For in addition to the general methodological question, let us remember that this same Akiban- Ishmaelean disagreement surfaced on a variety of issues-the timing of the blessing/curse at Mt. Gerizim, the onset of various agricultural duties and ritual requirements in connection with sacrifices-and hardly focuses on matters of seemingly political and social siginficance.55 We once again are forced to conclude that on the surface, at least, the single unifying factor is 54. Thus Mekhilta to Deuteronomy (p. 191, lines 7-12) states: "'Ye shall seek His habita- tion'-this means that they are required to demand (mrnn) a Temple ... Now, afortiori: if they are required thus to demand a Temple before one is built, certainly [they are required to demand one] after it has been built [and destroyed]. 'His habitation'-R. Simeon b. Yohai says, "This refers to Yavneh." "Ye shall seek His habitation'-Therefore the prophets and sages ... directed Israel to pray, thrice daily: 'Return Thy presence to Zion and the Temple-service to Thy city Jerusalem.' " The final homily refers, or course, to liturgical practice; but what of the first one, which speaks of "demanding" a Temple? In Midrash Shemu'el, p. 94, the homily else- where attributed to R. Simeon b. Yohai (see n. 41, above) concludes with a more historically personalized version of the above ("all those . .. fell because they did not demand the building of the Temple ... all the more so ought we, therefore the prophets and sages ordained .. ."), and the demand is identified-by a later editor?-with prayer. See also Midrash Tehillim, and Z. M. Rabinowitz, Ginzei Midrash (Tel-Aviv, 1977), p. 204. Yet the fault of David's men lay not only in their flawed prayer, and one wonders whether David himself, who is also blamed for not "demanding" a Temple (Pesiqta Rabbati, p. 6b) was only deficient in prayer. Prayer, then, is at least an indicator of desire, and perhaps more; but focusing on liturgical formulae blunts activist urgency. Thus Midrash Tehillim has: ". . . and ordained a separate benediction, 'God ... rebuilds Jerusalem,' " which seems to speak to the much narrower question of com- bining or separating the blessings for Davidic monarchy and the Temple in the prayer. Note, incidentally, the non-Temple orientation of R. Simeon in the Mekhilta passage cited! 55. See n. 26 above.</page><page sequence="24">38 GERALD J. BLIDSTEIN exegetical. The Akiban exegesis does embody an energetic temperament and demands that the people fulfill certain obligations without delay; but even the Ishmaelean version defers these obligations only until the years of "conquest and settlement" pass-hardly a quietistic posture. Indeed, one could argue that it is this position which is best attuned to military and polit- ical activism as the proper fulcrum to move a people closer to its religious and social ideal. III There is another interesting aspect to the interface of tannaitic discussion and messianic belief. The debate as to whether Israel was (or is) commanded to appoint a king took place within a religious community that believed in a historical restoration to take place, a restoration which focuses on a mes- sianic monarchic figure of the Davidic dynasty. Does R. Nehorai reject this vision? This query is not put to the representative of a distant, perhaps impenetrable, historical past alone. Medieval times, too, had individuals who defended the Nehorean case; and a twentieth-century rabbinic savant has taken Maimonides severely to task for deciding that Israel is command- ed to anoint a king, when the normal rules of codification would indicate that the Nehorean position should be the norm!56 The problem is thus one of religious phenomenology, not one of history or biography. A number of ideas suggest themselves. From a normative perspective, the non- (or anti-) monarchic option may represent an ideal that did not tri- umph, and the Davidic monarchy is thus a product of the nation's history, flawed but legitimate. Subsequent devotion to this dynasty is then warrant- ed by its having achieved this legitimate status, eventually underwritten by Scripture; it is not rooted in antemundane determinism. This view would entail that even messianic restoration will be conditioned by a flawed human history. A second perspective would detach the messianic reality from the present discussion entirely: the messianic moment (even in its Davidic ver- sion) would differ radically from the monarchic as an expression of political culture. Such nonmonarchic messianism could express itself in a number of different ways, depending of course on the world view with which it inte- 56. See Saadiah ben Joseph Gaon, Sefer ha-miSvot, ed. Y. F.

For others-R. Nehorai, perhaps?-messianism might denote a spiri- tualistic (or alternatively, an apocalyptic) moment that would dispense with the Davidic model as an expression of monarchic institutionalization but retain it as embodying a radically different reality. The Davidic king- Messiah would be less the fulfillment of a halakhic norm, more a bestowal from above. For those holding the view that monarchy is a halakhic impera- tive, on the other hand, the messianic moment too is integrated with and rendered intelligible by the standard norms of Jewish political culture. The attitudes toward monarchy, then, might correlate with the different modali- ties of eschatological redemption, indeed, with differing attitudes toward history itself.58 Department of History Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Beer Sheva, Israel 84120 57. The materials cited in E. E. Urbach, The Sages, 2 vols. (Jerusalem, 1975), 1: 690-92 might also be seen in a similar perspective. 58. Moshe Beer's "Simeon Bar Yohai and Jerusalem" [Hebrew], Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, ed. Aaron Oppenheimer (Jerusalem, 1980), pp. 361-75, appeared after I com- pleted this essay.
