Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005. xii, 226 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001050 Astonishingly, as in many ways we are still absorbing its impact, forty years have elapsed since the publication of the first of the five volumes of S. D. Goitein's 180</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews A Mediterranean Society (1967-93). Goitein's prodigious labors revealed to everyone with an interest in the communities, religions, and economies of the medieval Mediterranean what had previously been known only to a small band of specialists: that the three-quarters of a million folios so long immured in the geniza of the Ben Ezra Synagogue of Old Cairo provided evidence of quite unpar alleled richness and intimate detail about the life and culture of the city's Jewish community, especially from the mid-tenth to the mid-thirteenth century. Goitein's second volume, published in 1971, devoted a substantial chapter to the "social ser vices" of the synagogue, its charitable foundations and distributions, based on the numerous lists of contributors and beneficiaries catalogued in his appendices. In his final, posthumously published volume on "The Individual" (1988), he returned to the question of poverty, but this time from the perspective of the poor rather than those who provided for them, and of private rather than communal support. He translated and discussed several petitions written to likely benefactors on behalf of those fallen on hard times. These letters, he implied (75), gave voice to the otherwise voiceless, because illiterate, poor. Despite its scale, Goitein always saw his work as provisional. First, he looked to others to expand the documentary base and amplify the discussion of it, and this is what Moshe Gil and his school have done for pious foundations. Second, as early as Volume 2, Goitein was already proposing "the main task of Geniza research, the systematic edition of the original texts with full translations, commentaries, and facsimiles" (ix). Even in the age of online editions, the mere beginning of that project remains a long way off. But Mark Cohen, in the two complementary volumes under review, has placed the study of poverty and poor relief as revealed by the geniza on a wholly new footing and has at least brought Goitein's dream a stage closer to realization. Cohen reports with justifi able pride that he has assembled a corpus of some 890 documents, a figure inevi tably dwarfed by the 4,000-odd that Goitein deployed in his panoramic survey but significantly larger than that of any previous specialized geniza study. Moreover, Cohen has published translations and detailed linguistic and historical commen taries on ninety texts, a few of them reproduced in facsimile: donor registers, alms lists, and related legal and administrative documents, but, still more, pauper petitions. Cohen thus shifts the emphasis, evident in the work of Goitein and Gil, from collective to individual action. Merely to have deciphered and understood some of these hastily written fragments was a heroic labor in itself, as Cohen's thick carpet of footnotes record ing alternative readings and disputed translations attests. The paperback collection of the translated texts, helpfully and succinctly introduced and meticulously re presented, will be gratefully received by students and specialists alike, and they will be immensely helpful to historians of poor relief dealing with other areas and periods. Like Goitein, though, Cohen is a historian more than he is a philol ogist. His monograph takes the corpus he has mastered and fashions out of it a picture that sets Jewish poverty and relief in Old Cairo against a very wide context. This context includes not only Jewish and Islamic poverty but also the longue dur?e of European charity, from the end of antiquity to the early modern period. Because the secondary literature on Jewish and Islamic charity is 181</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews surprisingly limited, Cohen's monograph is thus a major contribution to the study of its subject across the whole eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. He discusses all the main topics that one could wish for: the scale of the problem of poverty (up to a quarter of the Jewish population in the mid-twelfth century in Goitein's estimate); the vocabulary of poverty, which answers well to the distinction between structural and conjoncrural poor espoused by modern European historians; responses to the transient poor and to refugees and captives; the impact of indebtedness, especially arising from inability to pay the heavy poll-tax incumbent on non-Muslims; the recourses open to poor women, particularly widows; the plight of the sick and, more briefly, the disabled (the latter a category only just coming into its own in the historiography of medicine and poverty); and the interplay of private and insti tutional charity, territory familiar from Goitein's pages but here presented with much additional material and with a clearer explanation of why it suggests a departure from the talmudic separation of support for local poor from that for foreigners. Only those as well acquainted with the evidence as is Cohen will be in a pos ition to contest the interpretation of individual texts. The rest of us, including the present reviewer, can only record our gratitude and table some questions for future debate. Can we really hear "the voice of the poor"? Not "the poor" in their entirety. Nearly all of the petitions on which Cohen for the most part relies reflect the needs of the conjoncrural poor, the "shamefaced" as they would be called in Europe, who usually requested short-term support in time of crisis. For the larger group of chronically impoverished, the lists of alms recipients are much less eloquent. Not?or not quite?the authentic "voice" of the poor: The petitioners are dictating to scribes, and their pleas are often formulaic, although, as Cohen rightly notes, the circumstantial detail varies markedly from one letter to the next, even where the scribe is the same, and this detail is certainly plausible. Was the family as welfare provider the great submerged part of the iceberg, taken for granted except in moments of incapacity and thus scarcely mentioned in the texts? Cohen believes so, in explicit contradiction of the present reviewer. He offers some evidence in his support, but not enough, I believe to settle the matter. That inconclusiveness is only to be expected. For all the efforts of Goitein, and now of Cohen as his worthy successor, the Cairo Geniza has so far yielded only a fraction of the histories once deposited within it.
