<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH: PROVISIONAL OR PERMANENT? by MENACHEM KELLNER I What was Maimonides' attitude toward the typically medieval description of the universe presented at the beginning of his great law code, the Mishneh Torah? Was that account of the physical universe meant only as a statement of the best description of nature available at the time (and thus radically distinct from the halakhic matters which make up the bulk of the Mishneh Torah), or was it meant to be a description of the true nature of the universe as it really is, not subject to revision in the light of new paradigms or new models (and thus essentially similar to the halakhic matters in the text)?' The Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture supported the research on which this study is based; I am pleased here to thank the Foundation for its support. For their intellectual support, I am indebted to Gad Freudenthal, Bernard R. Goldstein, and Giora Hon. 1. It is difficult to write on this subject without falling into anachronistic usages. The closest medieval terms for what we mean by the modem expression "science" in the broad sense seem to be hokhmah ("wisdom") or 'iyyun ("looking into," "speculation"), both of which can be translated back into modem English more easily as "philosophy" than as "science." Hokhmah, however, can also mean a specific discipline, and as such is adequately captured by the modern term "science" when it refers to a specific scientific discipline. But here, too, the overlap in meaning is hardly isomorphic. The main problem is that between the time of Maimonides and his contemporaries and our own day, the great scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries took place and the term "science" began carrying with it a whole new range of sociological and epistemological meanings; furthermore, the term "scientist" was coined, a usage which has no place in discussions of medieval thought. Another AJS Review 18/2 (1993): 169-194 169</page><page sequence="2">170 MENACHEM KELLNER In this paper I make the following argument: Maimonides, as a man of his time, had many reasons to hold that the physics he presented in the Mishneh Torah was complete and perfected, sharing the epistemological status of the halakhot codified in that text. I will show that Maimonides did not in fact adopt this view. In so doing light will be shed on Maimonides' views of rabbinic and scientific authority.2 In two related studies, comparing the astronomy of the Mishneh Torah with that of the Guide of the Perplexed, I prove that Maimonides rejects the idea that astronomy and metaphysics can reach perfection,3 and suggest that this rejection is based upon theological considerations crucial to Maimonides.4 The conclusions of those studies will be relied upon at certain points in this discussion, and where appropriate I will summarize their results. Maimonides opens the Mishneh Torah as follows: "The foundation of all foundations, and the pillar of all sciences, is to know that there exists a First Existent."5 Maimonides continues, telling us that the Torah positively notoriously problematic term is "progress," and where I am forced to use it I hope that I can avoid invoking wholly inappropriate connotations. It is hard to avoid using the term, however, since Maimonides and some of his contemporaries held a "whiggish" view of the history of natural sciences, according to which they had indeed progressed beyond the accomplishments of their predecessors. On whig interpretations of history generally, see Herbert Butterfield, The Whig Interpretation of History (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1963); on whig interpretations of the history of science, see, for example, Stephen Jay Gould, Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 4-5. 2.

Subsequent translations from Laws of the Foundations of the Torah will be from Moses Hyamson, ed. and trans., Maimonides, The Book of Knowledge (Jerusalem: Feldheim, 1974). Isaac Abravanel suggested that Maimonides meant to say here that the basic dogma of religious belief is the basic axiom of all the sciences; i.e., that religious belief and science share the same starting point and hence must arrive at the same conclusions.

Maimonides opens the second chapter by telling us that Jews are com- manded to love and fear God. "What is the way," Maimonides then asks in 2.2, "that will lead to the love of Him and fear of Him?" The answer, Maimonides says, is the examination of God's work of creation: "When a person contemplates His great and wondrous works and creatures and from them obtains a glimpse of His wisdom which is incomparable and infinite, he will straightaway love Him, glorify Him, and long with an exceeding longing to know his great name."'7 By way of helping his reader to fulfill the commandment to love and fear God, Maimonides explains "some large, general aspects of the works of the Sovereign of the Universe." Maimonides continues the second chapter of Laws of the Foundations of the Torah with a cursory account of the Separate Intellects, or angels.s These two chapters, we are told indirectly, deal with metaphysics.'

In his book enumerating the commandments, Sefer ha-Mizvot, this is positive commandment no. 1. 7. The obligation to study God's works in order to know God to some extent is one of the recurring motifs of medieval Jewish philosophical thought. See, for example, Steven Harvey, Falaquera's "Epistle of the Debate" (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987), p. 88. 8. For the identification of Separate Intellects, with angels, see Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, pt. 2, chap. 6. In the translation of Shlomo Pines (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), p. 262. Subsequent citations from the Guide will be from this translation. The question of the relationship between the views Maimonides expresses in the Mishneh Torah and those which he expresses in the Guide of the Perplexed (and the exact nature of the views which he espouses in the Guide) is one of the most hotly debated issues in current Maimonidean scholarship. Recent studies which focus on this issue include Oliver Leaman, Moses Maimonides (London: Routledge, 1989); Marvin Fox, Interpreting Maimonides (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990); and Menachem Kellner, Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991). The nature of science is not an issue which Maimonides addressed directly (exoterically or esoterically) and is not a question on which he can reasonably be thought to have had an esoteric teaching. 9. Maimonides says that these chapters deal with Ma'aseh Merkavah ("Account of [Ezekiel's vision of] the Chariot") in Foundations 2.11. For the claim that Ma'aseh Merkavah means metaphysics, see Maimonides' commentary on Mishnah Hagigah 2.1, Guide 1, Introduction (p. 6), and my detailed discussion in Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People, chap. 8.</page><page sequence="4">172 MENACHEM KELLNER fourth chapters present a brief summary of physical science:10 the third is given over largely to superlunar matters, the fourth to sublunar affairs. Chapters 3 and 4, then, present an account of the physical universe as Maimonides saw it. It is a finite universe, composed of nine concentric spheres, with the earth in the center. The ninth and largest sphere "includes and encircles all things." Each of the eight internal spheres is divided into subspheres, "like the several layers of onions." These subspheres are contiguous, with no empty space between them at all. In addition to the concentric spheres which encompass the earth, there are smaller spheres fixed in the larger spheres. In a statement which will be important for us below, Maimonides summarizes the situation: The number of all the spheres that revolve around the world is eighteen. The number of small spheres that do not so revolve is eight. And from the courses of the stars, from their known daily and hourly rate of movement, from their declination from the south towards the north and from the north towards the south, from their height about the earth and their approximation to it, the number of these spheres can be ascertained, as well as the lines of their movement and the courses they traverse. This forms the science of mathematical astronomy, on which the Greek sages composed many treatises. (3.5) Maimonides continues his description of the superlunar realm, making com- ments about the size of some of the planets, and their distance from the earth. The spheres and stars, we are told, are living beings, possessed of souls and endowed with intelligence. Laws of the Foundations of the Torah 3 closes with a transition to the sublunar realm; the reader is told of the four elements of Greek physics: earth, water, air, and fire. These bodies, unlike those of the superlunar world, are lifeless, without souls or intelligence. The sublunar realm is then described in the fourth chapter: it is the world of the four elements and of bodies composed of them. It is a world in which things strive always to return to their natural place. It is a world of constant generation and corruption, a world the most fundamental principles of which are form and matter. 10. Maimonides says that these chapters deal with Ma'aseh Bereshit ("Account of Creation") in Foundations 4.10. For the claim that Macaseh Bereshit means physics, see Maimonides' commentary on Mishnah Hagigah 2.1, Guide 1, Introduction (p. 6), and my detailed discussion in Maimnonides on Judaism and the Jewish People, chap. 8.</page><page sequence="5">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 173 Maimonides' description of the universe is dramatically different from the world in which we live, work, and play: ours is an infinite universe, in which material bodies exist in a vacuum; in our solar system, the sun stands at the center, the dead planets revolving around it. Gravity replaces the notion of "natural place," and atomic physics the four elements. Maimonides' description would present no problem did it not appear in a law code, the Mishneh Torah, in a section called Laws of the Foundations of the Torah. Maimonides composed his code in an apodictic fashion because he expected it to be exactly that: a code.1 Furthermore, it was a work meant to translate the immutable Torah of God into a useful, manageable body of specific prescriptions. It was Maimonides' hope that the Mishneh Torah would be adopted as the binding code of Jewish law.I2 Did Maimonides expect his vision of the physical universe to be as immutable as his codification of the laws, say, of theft? In other words, does the description of the universe presented in Foundations of the Torah have the same binding status as the commandments codified there and in other parts of the Mishneh Torah? Some interpreters of Maimonides think so. I recently heard a lecture by a prominent physicist and Habad Hasid who argued that since Maimonides wrote his Mishneh Torah with divine assistance, we had to interpret our view of the universe to match his; we are not permitted to dismiss his understanding of the superlunar and sublunar worlds as expressions of now outmoded theories." Maimonides himself may have had a more modest 11. For a detailed and nuanced discussion of Maimonides' statements on this matter, see Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah) (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), pp. 97-187. 12. As Maimonides states: "On these grounds I, Moses, the son of Maimon, the Sefardi, bestirred myself, and, relying on the help of God, Blessed be He, intently studied all these works, with the view of putting together the results obtained from them in regard to what is forbidden or permitted, clean or unclean, and the other rules of the Torah-all in plain language and terse style, so that thus the entire Oral Law might become systematically known to all ... [and so] that all the rules shall be acessible to young and old ... so that no other work should be needed for ascertaining any of the laws of Israel, but that this work might serve as a compendium of the entire Oral Law .... Hence, I have entitled this work Mishneh Torah (Repetition of the Law), for the reason that a person who first reads the Written Law and then this compilation, will know from it the whole of the Oral Law, without having occasion to consult any other book between them" (Mishneh Torah, Introduction, Hyamson, p. 4b). See further Hannah Kasher, "The Study of Torah as a Means of Apprehending God in Maimonides' Thought," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986): 71-81 (Hebrew). 13. Not every traditionalist interpreter of Maimonides takes this view. R. Meir Leibush Malbim, the nineteenth-century author of a popular and highly traditionalist commentary on</page><page sequence="6">174 MENACHEM KELLNER assessment of his own work,'4 but the question remains valid and of interest: Was this Maimonides' own view? Did he, that is, consider the description of the physical universe presented in the Mishneh Torah as representing the final word on the subject, or was he prepared to entertain the possiblity that our understanding of the universe might develop beyond the stage it had reached in his day? An analysis of this issue will help us further to understand Maimonides' conception of philosophy and its relationship to halakhah, his views concerning what we would today call progress, his own self-understanding as a student of physics and metaphysics, and the vast gulf which separates the world of Maimonides from our own." At this point another issue raises its head, one which cannot be wholly ignored.16 Maimonides' philosophy is based in very large measure on his physics and metaphysics. I will demonstrate below that Maimonides related to the description of the universe presented in the Mishneh Torah as provisional in the sense that it could be superseded by future developments. If the physics of the Mishneh Torah (both terrestrial and celestial) is mutable, can the metaphysics of the Mishneh Torah and of the Guide of the Perplexed be the Bible, in his Commentary to Ezekiel (Vilna, 1911), p. 3a, rejects Maimonides' explanation of Ezekiel's Vision of the Chariot (Ma'aseh Merkavah) on the explicit grounds that "the foundations on which he built it have been refuted. The astronomy, natural science, and ancient philosophy which were the foundations and supports of his interpretation have been completely undermined and destroyed by the scientific research which has developed in recent generations." I cite this passage as it is brought by Marvin Fox, Interpreting Maimonides, pp. 23-24. 14. But not necessarily; see Abraham Joshua Heschel, "Did Maimonides Believe That He Had Attained Prophecy?" Louis Ginzberg Jubilee Volume (New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1946), pp. 159-188. 15. The issue gains further importance in the light of a comment by Isadore Twersky to the effect that for Maimonides, "knowledge of the physical sciences is necessary for a correct understanding of halakhah." See Twersky, "Halakhah and Science: Perspectives on the Epistemology of Maimonides," Hebrew Law Annual 14-15 (1988-89): 121-151 (Hebrew), p. 132. I am not competent to go into the question of the status of specific halakhic decisions (if any) in the Mishneh Torah which depend upon now rejected theories concerning the nature of the physical world. But if Twersky is correct in his assessment (and the evidence he adduces is most convincing), then the question of Maimonides' own understanding of the status of the physics and biology he presents in the Mishneh Torah should be of crucial interest and importance to historians of halakhah. Further on the issue of halakhah and science, see the remarks of Shalom Rosenberg, Torah u-Madda' bi-Hagut ha-Yehudit ha-Hadashah (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education and Culture, 1988), pp. 58-62. 16. Although I did my best to ignore it in an earlier draft of this essay; my thanks to Gad Freudenthal for not allowing me to get away with it.</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 175 immutable? Since Maimonides argues that correct religious belief depends upon correct philosophical belief,17 our question here becomes, how can a mutable account of the universe serve as the basis for religion? In part, the answer to this question depends upon the fact that Maimonides dramatically distinguishes the description of the cosmos in the Mishneh Torah, which is conventional and addressed to the rank and file of the Jewish people, from that of the Guide of the Perpelexed, which is far more sophisticated and serves as a stable basis for the philosophical and religious edifice constructed upon it."8 But what of the "wisdom" (physics and metaphysics) of the Guide: can it change too? I think that Maimonides would have been surprised if sublunar physics changed, but not be unduly upset, since that physics is not crucial to his theology. And since he held that celestial physics, which is crucial to his theology, is basically beyond our knowing, he could, I think, 17. On this, see my Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), chap. 1. 18. See my "Astronomy and Physics in Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and Guide of the Perplexed." I there argue that even though Maimonides clearly held what would today be called a "whiggish" view of scientific progress, and also held that the sciences could reach perfection or completion, he still maintained that the science in the Mishneh Torah was simply the most up-to-date scientific information available to him, not the most perfect account of science which could ever be reached. In proving this I noted that Maimonides distinguished radically between sublunar and superlunar science: the former could reach completion, and in fact had been brought to completion; the latter was incomplete and would forever remain so. It must remain incomplete and unperfected because the heavens are the heavens of the Lord and will always remain beyond our ken, both in terms of the actual motions of the heavenly bodies and in terms of what we can know about the incorporeal intellects associated with those bodies. In other words, the actual truth concerning celestial physics and concerning metaphysics lies beyond the limits of human knowledge. This position (which aids him in the solution of many theological problems) forces Maimonides to adopt an instrumentalist view of astronomy, according to which it is the goal of the astronomer to provide a mathematical model of the observed motions of the heavenly bodies (to "save the phenomena"), not to describe them as they actually are. Maimonides' instrumentalism, then, is a handmaiden of his theology. Admitting that metaphysics and celestial physics will never be brought to completion, perhaps in Maimonides' day they had reached the highest level they ever would reach? Were that the case, then perhaps the account of natural matters given in the Mishneh Torah really does represent the most complete possible picture and not simply the most up-to-date picture available to Maimonides. Two reasons were adduced for rejecting this hypothesis: first, Maimonides himself foresaw the possibility of progress in the understanding of superlunar phenomena; second; the account of astronomical matters presented in the Mishneh Torah is simply incorrect on Maimonides' own terms as expressed in the Guide of the Perplexed and thus could not represent his view of the most perfect possible view of superlunar science.</page><page sequence="8">176 MENACHEM KELLNER envision basic changes in it with relative equanimity. In effect, the limitations Maimonides imposes upon the scope and content of metaphysics render his theology relatively independent of change, development, even revolution in the sciences. There are good reasons to suppose that Maimonides would urge us to relate to his account of the universe in the Mishneh Torah as being nothing more than a statement of the best physics available in his day, not as an incontrovertible account of the world as it actually is, was, and always will be. The strongest reason for understanding Maimonides in this fashion is his account of how we are to relate to the scientific pronouncements of the rabbinic sages. He sharply distinguishes their role as transmitters of the Sinaitic revelation from their role as individuals reporting on their own ideas and interpretations or on the best physical science of their day. Thus, in connection with questions concerning the messianic advent, Maimonides writes: Some of our Sages say that the coming of Elijah will precede the advent of the Messiah. But no one is in a position to know the details of this and similar things until they have come to pass. They are not explicitly stated by the Prophets. Nor have the Rabbis any tradition with regard to these matters. They are guided solely by what the scriptural texts seem to imply. Hence there is a divergence of opinion upon the subject.19 The talmudic sages, when describing the messianic world, were not transmit- ting "Torah from Sinai." They were, rather, reporting on what today would be called "educated guesses." 19. Laws of Kings and Their Wars 12.2. I cite the translation of A. M. Hershman, Book of Judges (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1949). For Maimonides' attitude toward midrash in general, see the introduction to his commentary on Mishnah Sanhedrin, Perek Helek. The text is available in English in I. Twersky, ed., A Maimonides Reader (New York: Behrman House, 1972), pp. 401-423.

One of the ancient opinions that are widespread among the philosophers and the general run of people consists in the belief that the motion of the spheres produces very fearful and mighty sounds .... This opinion also is generally known in our religous community. Do you not see that the sages describe the might of the sound produced by the sun when it every day proceeds on its way in the sphere?21 ... Aristotle, however, does not accept this22 and makes it clear that the heavenly bodies produce no sound. You should not find it blameworthy that the opinion of Aristotle disagrees with that of the sages. .... [The sages themselves] in these astronomical matters preferred the opinion of the sages of the nations of the world to their own. For they explicitly say, "The sages of the world have vanquished."23 And this is correct. For everyone who argues 20. It might be objected to the argument being developed here that showing that Maimonides held that some of the sages could and did err proves nothing about his understanding of the epistemological status of his own science, since he may have held himself to be superior (in having reached a higher degree of intellectual perfection) to all or most of the sages. This is not the place to go into a detailed refutation of this hypothesis. Here it should suffice to note that this objection rests upon the claim that Maimonides presented as what Pines called "a convenient fiction" his argument that the prophets and sages had access to a philosophic tradition some of the elements of which he had succeeded in teasing out of the sources with enormous difficulty. This objection further rests on a reading of Maimonides which renders absurd his attempts to understand rabbinic allegories philosophically: if he held himself to be a better philosopher than all or most of the sages, why bother reconstructing the philosophic meaning under their allegories? I reject this approach to reading Maimonides. This rejection finds detailed expression in two recent books of mine, Maimonides on Human Perfection (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990) and Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991). In the latter, for example, I show that Maimonides adopted unusual positions on religious matters (providence, prophecy, immortality, messianism, the nature of the Jewish people, the nature of the Torah, and others) because of his antecedent adoption of an Aristotelian psychology. Were his philosophic and religious concerns as radically divorced as Pines maintains, he could have saved himself from much aggravation and calumny by simply adopting unexceptionable, standard positions on these religious matters, even though such positions contradicted his "truly held" philosophical beliefs. For other recent studies critical of the Pines approach, see the books by Leaman and Fox, cited in n. 8 above. 21. Pines cites Pesahim 94b. 22. Pines cites On the Heavens ii.9.290b. 12 ff. 23.

Hence the conclusion whose demonstration is correct is believed. (2.8, p. 267) Truth is truth;24 what is proved, is proved. No matter who says the opposite, their view is not to be accepted. Maimonides often gives expression to this attitude. It is my intention in this chapter to draw your attention to the ways of research and belief. If anybody tells you in order to support his opinion that he is in possession of proof and evidence and that he saw the thing with his own eyes, you have to doubt him, even if he is an authority accepted by great men, even if he is himself honest and virtuous. Inquire well into what he wants to prove to you. Do not allow your senses to be confused by his research and innovations [stories]. Think well, search, examine, and try to understand [the ways of nature] which he claims to know. Do not allow yourself to be influenced by the sayings that something is obvious, whether a single man is saying so or whether it is a common opinion, for the desire of power leads men to shameful things, particularly in the case of divided opinions. ... I advise you to examine critically the opinions even of such an authority and prominent sage as Galen.25 One of the reasons that people are led astray by arguments to authority is because of their excessive veneration of the written word, especially when found in ancient works: "The great sickness and the grievous evil (Eccl. 5:12) consists in this: that all the things that man finds written in books, he presumes to think of as true-and all the more so if the books are old."26 24. And, as Maimonides says, "For only truth pleases Him, may He be exalted, and only that which is false angers Him" (2.48, p. 409). 25. Pirkei Mosheh, chap. 25.

Letter on Astrology, translated by Ralph Lerner in Medieval Political Philosophy, ed.</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 179 Maimonides rejects the approach; one must follow the argument where it leads, even if that means that one imputes error to one of the sages of the Talmud. I know that you may search and find sayings of some individual sages in the Talmud and Midrashoth whose words appear to maintain that at the moment of a man's birth, the stars will cause such and such a thing to happen to him. Do not regard this as a difficulty, for it is not fitting for a man to abandon the prevailing law and raise once again the counterarguments and replies [that preceded its enactment].27 Similarly, it is not proper to abandon matters of reason that have already been verified by proofs, shake loose of them, and depend on the words of a single one of the sages from whom possibly the matter was hidden. Or there may be an allusion in those words; or they may have been said with a view to the times and business before him. ... A man should never cast his reason behind him, for the eyes are set in front, not in back.28 The second passage from the Guide in which Maimonides informs his readers that the sages erred on what we today call scientific matters explicitly distinguishes the authority of the sages as transmitters of Torah from their authorities as astronomers. Do not ask me to show that everything they [the sages] have said concerning astronomical matters conforms to the way things really are. For at that time mathematics were imperfect. They did not speak about this as transmitters of the dicta of the prophets,29 but rather because in those times they were men of knowledge in those fields or because they had heard these dicta from the men of knowledge who lived in those times. (3.15, p. 459) If Maimonides thought that the sages could err when they relied on the best account of the universe with which they were familiar, would he not feel Ralph Lerner and Muhsin Mahdi (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972), p. 229. On this text, see Jacob I. Dienstag, "Maimonides' Letter on Astrology to the Rabbis of Southern France," Kiryat Sefer 61 (1987): 147-158 (Hebrew). 27. I.e., Maimonides had just proven that the rejection of astrology is "one of the roots of the religion of Moses our Master" (p. 234). 28. Letter on Astrology, p. 235. 29.

Exodus 24 begins as follows: "And unto Moses He said: 'Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.'" After sundry events, the passage continues (vv. 9-11): Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand; and they beheld God, and did eat and drink. These verses obviously raise all sorts of questions.31 Let us focus here on one that troubled Maimonides: what does the reference to God's "feet" mean in this context? Just "seeing" God can be understood in purely intellectual 30. This attitude of Maimonides' toward the sages finds indirect expression in another source. In Guide 2.9 (p. 268) Maimonides records the claim that there are nine spheres. But spheres can be counted in different ways (compare Laws of the Foundations of the Torah 3.2), and what one person counts as nine, another could count differently. "For this reason," Maimonides says, "you should not regard as blameworthy" a rabbinic dictum which seems to indicate that there are only two spheres. Relevant to our theme here is the unarticulated supposition that in astronomical matters rabbinic dicta have to be brought into line with those of the astronomers, not the other way around. It was the rabbinic dictum which might be thought to be "blameworthy," not that of the astronomers. Another indirect expression of Maimonides' idea that the sages could err on matters of physics and metaphysics may be found in his use of the expression "Ben Zoma is still outside" in Guide 3.51 (p. 619). As Marc Saperstein has shown in a remarkably sensitive reading of this passage in the Guide (Decoding the Rabbis [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1980], p. 18), Maimonides uses this text (from Hagigah 15a) to indicate that Ben Zoma, a mishnaic sage, failed to attain mastery over the physical sciences and thus failed to attain even a rudimentary knowledge of God. Maimonides clearly felt that he himself was, and the student to whom he addressed the Guide could be, superior to Ben Zoma in scientific (and hence religious) attainments. Ben Zoma, it should be recalled, was one of the three companions who sought to enter "Paradise" with R. Akiba (Hagigah 14b). Ben Zoma apparently lost his mind as a result of this experience, adding to the impression that he would not have been considered by Maimonides to be one of the leading sages. On the Hagigah text, see the discussion in Gershom Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1965), pp. 14-19. 31.

Maimonides explains that it was "the nobles of the children of Israel," not Moses, who saw this (1.5, p. 30). Their apprehension of God was imperfect because they were "overhasty [and] strained their thoughts," and thus "corporeality entered into" their apprehension of God to some extent. Put simply, they made a mistake in their approach to the science of metaphysics. Now, who were the "nobles of the children of Israel"? From the biblical text it appears that they are the "elders of Israel" spoken of earlier in the passage. This is the interpretation of the standard Jewish commentators on the Bible, and, more important, it is clearly the interpretation of Maimonides, as his discussion in 1.5 makes clear. Who, then, are the elders of Israel? As it turns out, they are individuals who, at least from time to time, reach a low level of prophecy. In Guide 2.45 Maimonides distinguishes eleven degrees of prophecy. The second degree is composed of those "who speak through the Holy Spirit." The authors of Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Daniel, Job, in short, of all of the Hagiographa, wrote their works having achieved this degree of prophetic inspiration. "It was to this group," Maimonides says, "that the 'seventy elders' belonged" (with reference to Numbers 11:25), as did Eldad and Medad, and as did all the high priests when they received oracular information through the Urim and Tummim. Returning to our issue, we see that Maimonides imputed scientific error, not only to the rabbinic sages, but even to individuals who were capable of achieving a low level of prophetic inspiration.33 How much more so, it is safe to assume, would he be willing to impute the possibility of such error to himself! Further support for this position is found in Maimonides' attitude toward Aristotle. In a well-known letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon, Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded Aristotle, because the works of the latter 32. The point of Maimonides' discussion in Guide 1.4-5. 33. Two points should be noted here. First, this means that the "nobles of the children of Israel" were superior in their intellectual attainments to Aristotle, who, as we shall see below, never achieved even the lowest level of prophetic inspiration; despite this they erred on an important metaphysical (and thus scientific) matter. Second, if Isaac Abravanel, Shalom Rosenberg, and W. Z. Harvey are all correct, then Maimonides even imputed scientific error to Ezekiel, who achieved the fifth degree of prophecy.

His intellect,34 Aristotle's, is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from those upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, 35 there being no level higher.36 We must further note that in Guide 1.5 (p. 28) Maimonides calls Aristotle, "the chief of the philosophers."37 Who were the philosophers of whom Aristotle is the chief? In his "Letter on Astrology" to the sages of Montpellier, Maimonides writes that the hakhamim, or wise men, of Greece, who were philosophers and "who are genuinely wise,"'38 never dealt with astrology. In his commentary to Mishnah Avodah Zarah 4.7, Maimonides explains at length that the philosophers never dealt with astrology, which, as he explains both there and in Laws of Idolatry 1.1, is the cause and root of idolatry. Aristotle, then, in his own right nearly reached the level of prophecy; he is "chief' of the philosophers who attained to such an understanding of the universe on their own steam that they rejected astrology because it leads to idolatry. Put simply, Maimonides thought very highly of Aristotle. But not so highly that he thought that Aristotle could not err on matters of physics and metaphysics: it is well known that Maimonides at least claimed to reject Aristotle's assertion that the universe was uncreated. It 34. Hebrew (the Arabic original of the letter is lost): da'ato. Another possible translation is "his knowledge."

Everything that Aristotle has said about all that exists from beneath the sphere of the moon to the center of the earth is indubitably correct, and no one will deviate from it unless he does not understand it or unless he has preconceived opinions that he wishes to defend or that lead him to a denial of a thing that is manifest. On the other hand, everything that Aristotle expounds with regard to the sphere of the moon and that which is above it is, except for certain things, something analagous to guessing and conjecturing. All the more does this apply to what he says about the order of the intellects and to some of the opinions regarding the divine that he believes; for the latter contain grave incongruities and perversities that manifestly and clearly appear as such to all the nations, that propagate evil, and that he cannot demonstrate. (2.22, pp. 319-320) Maimonides emphasizes this point by repeating it. I shall repeat here what I have said before [2.22]. All that Aristotle states about that which is beneath the sphere of the moon is in accordance with reasoning; these are things that have a known cause, that follow one upon the other, and concerning which it is clear and manifest at what points wisdom and natural providence are effective. However, regarding all that is in the heavens, man grasps nothing but a small measure of what is mathematical; and you know what is in it. (2.24, p. 326) Why was Aristotle mistaken in this fashion? Maimonides explains: "However, as I have let you know, the science of astronomy was not in his [Aristotle's] time what it is today" (2.19, p. 308).40 Once again, if Aristotle can be mistaken about astronomical matters, would not Maimonides admit that he himself could be mistaken?41 There is yet a further reason for thinking so and for thinking that Maimonides was 39. This is the burden of Maimonides' refutation of Aristotle's thesis concerning the eternity of the world in Guide 2.13-31; see especially chap. 17. 40. Compare also 2.3, p. 254. Here we have an example of Maimonides' whig interpretation of the history of science. 41. The argument here rests upon the assumption that Maimonides saw himself as part of an ongoing process of investigation into physics and metaphysics; if he thought that his own work (or generation) marked the capstone of all possible scientific development, then my</page><page sequence="16">184 MENACHEM KELLNER not irretrievably wedded to the details of the account of the structure of the universe presented in the Mishneh Torah.42 Maimonides, it turns out, for all his interest in presenting the Mishneh Torah in apodictic terms, was not even wedded irretrievably to the details of his account of halakhah presented there. He recognized that he could err, corrected mistakes which he caught himself, and admitted the fact when others found mistakes in the work.43 It seems fairly clear that if Maimonides was willing to admit that in halakhic matters the Mishneh Torah was not necessarily the last word, he would even more be willing to admit that such was the case with his description of the physical universe. There are further reasons for thinking that Maimonides presented his account of nature in the Mishneh Torah provisionally, as a statement of the best science available to him, and not as the final, absolute account of the universe as it truly is, was, and always will be. Maimonides held that human history was largely marked by a development away from falsehood and toward truth, in matters both philosophical and religious. May we not assume that he held that this would continue after his day as well? With respect to the ever greater approximation of truth in the various spheres of philosophy (what we would today call "science"), we just saw that Maimonides held that the mathematical sciences were incorrectly understood in Aristotle's day; in his own day they had reached a much higher level of perfection. This is true not only of the mathematical sciences, but also of anatomy: "[Galen] attained enormous success in anatomy, and things became clear to him in his time that were not apparent to anyone else. In addition, the activities and functions of organs, and their physiology, as well as conditions of the pulse which were not clear at the time of Aristotle [were understood argument clearly fails. That he did not so think is shown by the text I will cite immediately below from 2.24 (p. 327). 42. I say "details of the account" because it is safe to say that Maimonides would be very surprised by Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein. Acceptance of some notion of development in the understanding of the universe in the Middle Ages cannot be equated with our modern expectation that just as the Newtonian universe was replaced by the Einsteinian, the Einsteinian universe may very well be replaced by another vision of the structure of the cosmos. 43. For details, see Alexander Marx, "Maimonides and the Scholars of Southern France," Hebrew Union College Annual 3 (1926): 325-335; reprinted in Marx, Studies in Jewish History and Booklore (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1944), pp. 48-62. The passage in question is found on p. 52 of the reprint.</page><page sequence="17">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 185 and explained by Galen."44 Finally, with respect to astronomical matters Maimonides thought that his own knowledge might be superseded: "It is possible that someone else will find a demonstration by means of which the true reality of what is obscure for me will become clear to him" (Guide 2.24, p. 327). Without getting into the vexed question of when the idea of progress entered Western culture, we can see here that Maimonides admitted the fact of scientific development and even anticipated that science would develop beyond what he himself, or, more accurately, his generation, had been able to accomplish in it.45 In terms of what we can call "spiritual progress," Maimonides indicates that human beings grow and develop from generation to generation, both as individuals and as a race. As individuals, Maimonides maintained in one of the most notorious passages in the Guide, the generation of the Exodus were unable to worship God in a truly mature fashion and needed a sacrificial cult. For a sudden transition from one opposite to another is impossible. And therefore man, according to his nature, is not capable of abandoning suddenly all to which he was accustomed. ... and as at that time the way of life generally accepted and customary in the whole world and the universal service upon which we were brought up consisted in offering various species of living beings in the temples ... His wisdom, may He be exalted, and His gracious ruse, which is manifest in regard to all His creatures did not require that He give us a Law prescribing the rejection, abandonment, and abolition of all these kinds of worship. . . . At that time this would have been similar to the appearance of a prophet in these times who, calling upon the people to worship God, would say: "God has given you a Law forbidding you to pray to Him, to fast, to call upon Him for help in misfortune. Your worship should consist solely in meditation without any works at all." Therefore He, may He be exalted, suffered the above-mentioned kinds of worship to remain.46 (3.32, p. 526) 44.

In 3.51 Maimonides explains that in order to achieve true worship we must first strengthen the bond of intellect between ourselves and God. Having attained that apprehension, we can then truly love God ("love is proportionate to apprehension"). "After love of God, comes true worship: it consists in setting thought to work on the first intelligible and to devoting oneself exclusively to this as far as this is within one's capacity" (p. 621). Individual human beings have developed spiritually to the point where they can truly worship God through intellectual meditation.47 Eventually, all human beings will reach the point where they abandon idolatry and embrace Judaic monotheism: the Messiah "will prepare the whole world to serve the Lord with one accord, as it is written, For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent (Zephaniah 3:9)."48 Maimonides explains how this is going to come about in a remarkable text censored from the printed editions of the Mishneh Torah. But if he does not meet with full success, or is slain, it is obvious that he is not the Messiah promised in the Torah. He is to be regarded like all the other wholehearted and worthy kings of the House of David who died and whom the Holy One, blessed be He, raised up to test the multitude, as it is written And some of them that are wise shall stumble, to refine among them, and to purify, and to make white, even to the time of the end; for it is yet for the time appointed (Daniel 11:35). Even of Jesus of Nazareth, who imagined that he was the Messiah, and was put to death by the court, Daniel had prophesied, as it is written And the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision: but they shall stumble (Daniel 11:14). For has there ever been a greater stumbling than this? All the prophets affirmed that the Messiah would redeem Israel, save them, gather their dispersed, and confirm 47. This last point was suggested to me by J. J. Ross. See "Maimonides and Progress-Maimonides' Concept of History," in Hevrah vi-Historiah, ed. Yehezkel Cohen (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education and Culture, 1980), pp. 529-542 (Hebrew). 48. Laws of Kings 11.4.

But he [Jesus] caused Israel to be destroyed by the sword, their remnant to be dispersed and humiliated. He was instrumental in changing the Torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside God. But it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of the Creator; for our ways are not His ways, neither are our thoughts His thoughts. All these matters relating to Jesus of Nazareth and the Ishmaelite [Mohammed] who came after him, only served to clear the way for King Messiah, to prepare the whole world to worship God with one accord, as it is written For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent (Zephaniah 3:9). Thus the messianic hope, the Torah, and the commandments have become familiar topics-topics of conversation (among the inhabitants) of the far isles and many people, uncircumcised of heart and flesh. They are discussing these matters and the commandments of the Torah. Some say, "Those commandments were true, but have lost their validity and are no longer binding"; others declare that they had an esoteric meaning and were not to be taken literally; that the Messiah has already come and revealed their occult significance. But when the true King Messiah will appear and succeed, be exalted and lifted up, they will forthwith recant and realize that they have inherited nothing but lies from their fathers, that their prophets and forbears led them astray.49 Thanks to the intervention of Christianity and Islam, then, the world is being slowly monotheized, thus making possible the eventual advent of the Messiah. With such human development possible, is it credible that Maimonides would have thought that the description of the universe presented in his Mishneh Torah would never become outdated?5" It will be useful to summarize the materials adduced to this point. Did Maimonides think that the picture of the universe presented in the Mishneh Torah was like the traditional halakhah codified in that text: a body of precepts 49. 11.4; presented by Hershman on pp. xxiii-xxiv. See Hershman's comments there and Leah Naomi Goldfeld, "Laws of Kings, Their Wars, and the King Messiah," Sinai 91 (1983): 67-79 (Hebrew). 50. Lest it be objected that there is no necessary connection between spiritual and scientific improvement, let the following be noted: (a) true monotheism, for Maimonides, depends upon the correct intellectual apprehension of God; Maimonides' messianism, therefore, is based upon the assumption of universal intellectual (i.e., scientific) progress; (b) in general, and this is only to restate the previous point in broader terms, Maimonides did not view perfection as something which was radically divisible: true perfection in one area necessarily went hand in hand with true perfection in other areas; radical spiritual progress could not be absolutely divorced from radical intellectual (i.e., scientific) progress.</page><page sequence="20">188 MENACHEM KELLNER that would stand for all time? Or did he present these matters in the text as simply the most up-to-date account of the cosmos available to him, subject to change, development, refinement, or even total rejection? In support of the latter hypothesis I have adduced texts showing that Maimonides held that the rabbinic sages could err when led astray by the sciences of their day, that individuals capable of achieving a level of prophecy could make mistakes in fields such as physics, astronomy, and metaphysics, that Aristotle could so err, that he (Maimonides) himself could and did err in matters of halakhah, and that Maimonides recognized the fact of progress in scientific and spiritual spheres. III The question, however, is far from being as straightforward as I have made it appear to this point. In order fully to understand Maimonides' position on these matters, we will have to raise questions concerning the perfectibility of science and the role of astronomy. The discussion to this point would strike a contemporary scientist as odd. Few working scientists today would claim that they could ever (practically, if not necessarily theoretically)" achieve a complete and once-for-all account of some aspect of science.52 The reason for this has to do with modern conceptions of science as process (Forschung), not product (Wissenschaft),53 and, overall, with the question of the perfectibility of science. These issues will be taken up in what follows. 51. On this subject, see Nicholas Rescher, The Limits of Science (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984). 52. In modern philosophy of science this view has been particularly emphasized by Karl R. Popper, who called his autobiography, Unended Quest (LaSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1976) (a reprint of "Autobiography of Karl Popper," in Paul Arthur Schilpp, The Philosophy of Karl Popper [LaSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1974]). See, for example, p. 131: "This is why the evolution of physics is likely to be an endless process of correction and better approximation. And even if one day we should reach a stage where our theories were no longer open to correction, since they were simply true, they would still not be complete-and we would know it. For Goedel's famous incompleteness theorem would come into play: in view of the mathematical background of physics, at best an infinite sequence of such true theories would be needed in order to answer the problems which in any given (formalized) theory would be undecidable." Stephen Hawking is notorious for holding the opposed view that we will soon achieve knowledge of all the fundamental equations of reality. 53. On this distinction with respect to the differences between medieval and modern philosophy, see my "Is Contemporary Jewish Philosophy Possible?-No," in Studies in Jewish</page><page sequence="21">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 189 Did Maimonides think that we could reach perfection in or closure of the sciences? In other words, did he think that we could reach a stage at which all that could be known in some particular science or other would be known? It seems that the answer to this question is both yes and no. Before explaining the answer, it may be useful to elaborate on the question. Citing a text by Gersonides (1288-1344) will be helpful in this connection. Having proved philosophically to his own satisfaction that the world was created, Gersonides adds the following consideration: That which adds publicity and perfection to what has been made clear concern- ing the creation of the world is that we find that all that has been written in the sciences54 is new and recent. We find that the early [savants] said something about each science; afterwards each was perfected during the course of time. We find sciences which did not reach their perfection till Aristotle and others which did not reach their perfection till Galen. There is another science which we do not find perfectly in the work of any of the ancients; this is the science of astronomy. [All this shows that] a science which demands more time for its perfection because of what you must determine concerning it from the senses reaches its perfection later. Thus, the mathematical sciences, such as geometry and arithmetic, are found earlier than other sciences. Aristotle's predecessors already expressed them perfectly, according to what is told about them. Physical science, on the other hand, because of its greater need of the senses, reached its perfection later. Thus the art of medicine, which is more dependent upon the senses, especially with respect to what is learned in it from the senses and from dissection, reached perfection still later. But astronomy, which depends upon the senses in such a fashion that its perfection through them can come about only after a stupendously long time, reaches its perfection even later. Since these sciences bring a man along the route to perfection, and he naturally desires them, it cannot [therefore] be said [both] that the human race is uncreated and that these sciences were discovered by them recently, for were the matter so we would be faced with a possibility which only became actualized after the passage of an infinite period of time, despite the existence of many natural implements for bringing it into actuality, and of humankind's extremely strong natural desire to actualize it. This is clearly absurd.55 Philosophy: Collected Essays of the Academy for Jewish Philosophy, 1980-1985, ed. Norbert M. Samuelson (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1987), pp. 17-28. 54. Hokhniot; plural of hokhmnah. 55. Gersonides, Wars of the Lord 6.i.15. In the Leipzig, 1866 edition of the Wars (reprint: Berlin, 1923), the passage appears on p. 356.</page><page sequence="22">190 MENACHEM KELLNER In this text we find an idea of scientific progress clearly expressed. Gersonides places a great deal of emphasis on the cooperative nature of the scientific enterprise: students of nature labor, generation after generation, to add to our knowledge.56 Alongside this view of scientific progress we see the clearly expressed view that scientific progress is not an open-ended affair: the various sciences reach perfection or closure. The mathematical sciences were perfected by Aristotle's predecessors (contra Maimonides); Aristotle himself, it seems, brought physics to perfection; Galen brought medicine to perfection; astronomy, which depends upon a huge number of difficult observations, had not yet, by Gersonides' day, been brought to perfection." This, then, is the notion of the perfectibility of science which I have in mind. The idea that sciences can be brought to closure or perfection in this manner depends upon a conception of science as being primarily a matter of the amassing of knowledge (Wissenschaft) as opposed to a matter of ongoing research (Forschung); on a conception of science, that is, as product and not process. On this view scientific progress is possible, but it is a closed-ended affair: given enough time, every science will be brought to perfection and closure.'" Once that happens, the role of the student of nature is to preserve 56. The idea is repeated frequently in Gersonides' commentary on Song of Songs. See, for example, the following comment on 1:2: "The third impediment--our ignorance of the way that leads to perfection-will also be overcome in this fashion. This is so because while each of those who endeavor to achieve this apprehension by themselves will either apprehend nothing or very little, when what all of them have apprehended is gathered together, a worthy amount will have been gathered. Either by virtue of himself or by virtue of his directing those who see their words towards the achievement of the truth in this. Therefore, one must always be aided in one's research by the words of those who preceded him, especially when the truth in them has been revealed to those who preceded him, as was the case during the time of this sage, for the sciences were then greatly [perfected] in our nation. The matter being so, our perfected predecessors guide us in speculation in a way which brings us to perfection, either through their speech or writing, by virtue of the natural desire they have for proffering this influence, and will make known to us concerning each thing the way in which it should be researched, and what they have understood concerning it, together with the assistance [concerning it] which they have derived from their predecessors." 57. This understanding of scientific progress is unfashionable today, and derided as "whig- gish" by many students of the history of science circles. By imputing this view to Gersonides (and, as shall be seen, Maimonides) I do not mean to express either approval or disapproval of it. See further above, note 1. 58. The reason for this, I think, is that pre-Baconian science was largely deductive, not inductive. Starting out from a limited number of axioms, the number of useful and interesting theorems which can be deduced must be finite. Gersonides gives plenty of evidence that he</page><page sequence="23">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 191 and teach what has been discovered; no longer does he or she investigate and conduct independent research.59 What is Maimonides' position on this question? On the basis of the texts already quoted, we can see clearly that Maimonides largely accepts the state of affairs described in the passage quoted from Gersonides above. The mathematical sciences, while not perfected in Aristotle's time, had ultimately reached or at least come close to perfection; Aristotle had brought the physics of the sublunar world to perfection and closure;6 Galen had brought anatomy to a state of great perfection.61 But if this is the case, then perhaps my conclusion above, that Maimonides would admit that the description of the universe he presents in Laws of the Foundations of the Torah is provisional in the sense that it represents only the best and most up-to-date account of the sciences available to him, was too hasty. If the various branches of wisdom had reached perfection, then what Maimonides was presenting in the Mishneh Torah was not simply a report on the current status of our understanding of the universe, but the absolute conducted research into astronomy and even biology inductively, but his overall intellectual framework was deductive. 59. This is, as I understand it, the stereotype of pre-Galilean medieval science; how closely, if at all, that stereotype fits the facts I cannot say. This is also the view of science held by the ancien regime in Isaac Asimov's Foundation. For a discussion of the extent to which this stereotype matched reality, see Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, "Ptolemy vs. Al-Bitruji: A Study of Scientific-Decision Making in the Middle Ages,"Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences 35 (1985): 124-47. 60. See the texts cited above from Guide 2.22 and 24 (in the text between nn. 39 and 40). 61. Progress in the sciences (in the Gersonidean sense of the term as we are using it here), it should be noted, was not always assumed by medieval thinkers. Maimonides' fellow Cordovan Averroes thought that humanity had regressed in astronomy from the time of Aristotle. See Joel L. Kraemer, "Maimonides on Aristotle and Scientific Method," in Moses Maimonides and His Time, ed. Eric L. Ormsby (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 1989), pp. 53-88 (p. 81) (=Studies in Philosophy and the History of Philosophy 19).

On this basis we could construe Maimonides as saying that the sages and Aristotle erred in scientific matters simply because they lived in times before the various sciences had reached their perfection; the fact that they erred, therefore, does not mean that he must err. Since progress understood in this fashion is not open-ended, there is no problem with asserting both that human beings progress scientifically and spiritually, and that the acme of this progress has been reached, or nearly reached.62 It turns out, however, that this is not Maimonides' position. I have demonstrated elsewhere that Maimonides distinguishes between the astron- omy presented in the Mishneh Torah and in the Guide.63 Maimonides' astronomy in the Mishneh Torah is straightforwardly and conventionally Ptolemaic. Maimonides is there interested in presenting a nonproblematic account of the heavens in order to impress upon his readers the magnitude of God's wisdom. In the Guide of the Perplexed, on the other hand, he was interested in presenting the truth. The truth presented there is that astronomy and metaphysics are intrinsically uncompletable.64 Whether this truth was known to him when he wrote the Mishneh Torah, and hidden from his 62. Maimonides asserts that he is living on the eve of the messianic era and may even have meant it. For details, see my "A Suggestion Concerning Maimonides' Thirteen Principles and the Status of Non-Jews in the Messianic Era," in Tura-Oranim Studies in Jewish Thought: Simon Greenberg Jubilee Volume, ed. Meir Ayali (Tel Aviv: Ha-Kibbutz ha-Meuhad, 1986), pp. 249-260, n. 35 (Hebrew). 63. In "Astronomy and Physics in Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and Guide ofthe Perplexed." 64. A "complete" science would be one which could be presented in the manner laid down by Aristotle in the Posterior Analytics: a finite number of axioms from which all true knowledge taught by that science could be derived. For the impact of this position on medieval Jewish philosophy, see, for example, Joseph Albo, Sefer ha-Ikkarim 1.17 and Isaac Abravanel, Rosh Amanah, chap. 23 (in my translation [above, n. 5] p. 194); see further my discussion in "The Conception of Torah as a Deductive Science in Medieval Jewish Thought," Revue des 6tudes juives 146 (1987): 265-279. For Maimonides' reasons for reaching the conclusion that astronomy and metaphysics are uncompletable, see my "Maimonides and Gersonides on Astronomy and Metaphysics." In that article I show that in order to make his synthesis of religion and philosophy possible, Maimonides was forced to claim that the science of astronomy can never be brought to perfection or closure. What humans can know of astronomical phenomena does not accord with the true (unknowable) facts; rather, astronomical knowledge is only a model which allows us to make predictions, while telling us nothing about the true state of the heavens. This instrumentalist stance in science, I further argue, is a consequence of Maimonides' theory of divine attributes, just as Gersonides' realism in science is connected to</page><page sequence="25">MAIMONIDES ON THE SCIENCE OF THE MISHNEH TORAH 193 not to confuse them, or whether he hit upon it after completing the Mishneh Torah and before writing the Guide, is irrelevant; either way, the astronomy he presents in the Mishneh Torah does not represent the most perfect possible exposition of that science available to him and most certainly, therefore, does not represent the highest stage that astronomy can reach. IV I have argued here that Maimonides presented the scientific matters in the Mishneh Torah as simply the most up-to-date account of the universe available to him, subject to change, development, and refinement. In support of this claim I adduced materials showing that Maimonides held that the rabbinic sages could err when presenting evidence based on the sciences of their day, that individuals perfected enough to achieve some level of prophetic inspiration could err, that Aristotle could err in scientific matters, that he (Maimonides) could and did err in matters of halakhah, and that he expected there to be further progress in scientific and spiritual matters. All this being the case, I argued that Maimonides could not have been wedded irretrievably to his account of natural matters as found in Laws of the Foundations of the Torah at the beginning of the Mishneh Torah. But, taking away with the left hand what I had just given with the right, I then pointed out that the issue was not so simple and straightforward. Maimonides, in his medieval fashion, accepted the fact that closure or perfection of the sciences was inevitable. Furthermore, he held that the physical (sublunar) matters discussed in the Mishneh Torah represented physical science in its perfected, completed form. But if this is the case, then perhaps it is incorrect to conclude that Maimonides would admit that the description of the universe he presents in Laws of the Foundations of the Torah is provisional in the sense that it represents only the best and most up-to-date account of the sciences available to him. If the various branches of wisdom had reached perfection, then what Maimonides was presenting in the Mishneh Torah was not simply a report on the current status of our understanding of the universe, but a permanent his theory of divine attributes. If astronomy, the science of the motions of the heavenly bodies, is uncompletable, then metaphysics, the science which, inter alia, deals with the incorporeal movers of the heavenly bodies, is a fortiori incompletable.</page><page sequence="26">194 MENACHEM KELLNER description of physical and metaphysical truth parallel to the laws in the Mishneh Torah; the latter are the absolute codification of the commandments of Judaism once and for all time; the former represents an unalterable description of physical reality. On this basis Maimonides could be construed as saying that the sages and Aristotle erred in their descriptions of the natural world simply because they lived in times before the various sciences had reached their perfection; that they erred, therefore, does not mean that he must err. This approach allows us a whig approach to progress, one which does not understand such progress as open-ended; thus Maimonides could assert that human beings progress scientifically and spiritually, and that the acme of this progress has been reached, or nearly reached. But this in fact is not Maimonides' position. Astronomy and metaphysics had not reached perfection in his day, nor will they ever. The conclusion reached above stands: the astronomical science of the Mishneh Torah is not and cannot be the final, immutable statement of physical reality as it actually is.
