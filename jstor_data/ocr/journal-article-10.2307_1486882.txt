New York: New York University Press, 1995. xviii, 244 pp. Christoph Gassenschmidt's Jewish Liberal Politics in Tsarist Russia fills an important lacuna in the historiography of late Imperial Russian Jewry. Dispelling the commonplace notion that Jewish liberals were merely assimi- lationists, concerned only with the development of a Jewry more acceptable to Russian sensibilities, he develops the thesis that Jewish liberalism went through three distinct phases: until 1904, traditional shtadlanut, or interces- sion with the Russian authorities; from 1904 to 1906, in the context of the convocation of the first Duma, open political struggle for Jewish rights; finally, from 1906 to 1914, with the failure of the Russian parliamentary experiment, retreat to "organic work." The discussion of organic work, the development of grass-roots Jewish institutions that coincided with the liberal agenda, is the best part of this work. Gassenschmidt also outlines the extensive influence liberal Jewish politics and strategies had on Zionism and Jewish socialism, something which has not received adequate attention in the historiography of the period. Jewish Liberal Politics demonstrates that it is not impossible to write decent history on the Jews of Russia without using Jewish languages. Gassen- schmidt's teacher, Heinz-Dietrich Loewe, wrote an impressive study based</page><page sequence="2">136 BOOK REVIEWS almost exclusively on Russian-language primary sources.' Nevertheless, it is troubling that in his preface Gassenschmidt states that "it did not seem necessary to include Hebrew sources. .... All sources of immediate interest to this study were published in Russian" (p. xvii). This statement may be entirely true, but even Loewe-whose work concentrated on the tsarist perception of Jews rather than the Jews themselves-investigated Hebrew- language secondary sources with the help of other scholars.2 Some use of Yiddish sources is evident, but the blanket exclusion of Hebrew-language scholarship, particularly since much of the book deals with the conflict with Zionism, leaves this reader uncomfortable. Furthermore, the book does not take advantage of archival resources, something which was more easily accepted before glasnost and the fall of the Soviet Union. The publisher has not done justice to this important study. Poor editing makes the work seem rushed, and it reads more like a Ph.D. dissertation than a polished monograph. It is addressed rather narrowly to specialists, presuming a broad familiarity with late Imperial Russia that undergraduate readers would not have. The notes are overly long-76 pages of notes in small type accompany 141 pages of text-and include many detailed discussions that should have been edited into the body of the text. Furthermore, information in the notes is not included in the index. The copyediting is atrocious, leaving many foreign terms untranslated (malenkie dela, grodnonachalnik, gvirim, etc.) and with inconsistent usage (e.g., the Russian shtadlantsvo is used interchangeably with the Hebrew shtadlanut; the modem zikhronut is used in a Yiddish context despite the usage of Tiferes bokhurim and Kneset Isroel). Readers not familiar with both languages will be unnecessarily confused. Liberal Jewish Politics in Tsarist Russia is a valuable monograph that was published prematurely. This haste has limited the utility of the work, but specialists will find it a useful tool for understanding the dynamics of Russian Jewish politics at the turn of the century.
