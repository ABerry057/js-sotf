It has recently received increased attention from historians, however, this interest is distributed very unevenly in the various areas and aspects of Jewish life."2 Many scholars continue to emphasize the political complexities of the early modern period and focus on the anti-Jewish legislation and expulsions that appear to have dictated the fates of large numbers of German Jews. Even when they detail the relative independence of early modern Jews, most historians tend to see either Jewish isolationism or the Christian marginalization of Jews as the root cause.3 This article is based on a paper presented at the 38th Annual Conference of the Association for Jewish Studies in San Diego in 2006.1 thank the editors of the AJS Review for their encouragement and the journal's peer reviewers for remarkably helpful and nurturing comments. 1.

A number of historians have uncovered new or reevaluated extant archival sources, especially German court docu ments,4 as well as material culture artifacts that offer clues about the richness and var iegation of early modern Jewry.5 In some cases, these sources have forced scholars to ask new questions and to test long-held assumptions about early modern German Jewry. Some historians have further pushed the limits of interpretation with exciting and original methodological approaches and questions. This has been particularly true in the area of Jewish and Christian relations. Consider, for example, the work of Robert Liberles, which examines Jews, coffee, and the coffee trade in eighteenth century Germany. Liberles reviews a range of sources?from rabbinic responsa about coffee and its preparation and consumption to legal documents regarding restrictions on Jewish trade of the drink?and paints a nuanced picture of both internal religious discussion and the economic role of Jews in early modern Germany.6 Recent scholarship has taught us that early modern Jews did not necessarily form cohesive or homogenous societies and that Jewish communities often experi enced significant social stratification,7 with increasingly wide differences in wealth separating Jews.8 In some cities, such as Frankfurt am Main, large popu lation increases in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries led to internal tensions and limitations on Jewish migration by Jewish authorities.9 At the same time, we have come to understand that early modern German Jewish communities were fre quently multivalent and that they often existed in local, regional, and even imperial contexts.10 In writing of the Jews in Frankfurt, for example, the historian Michael Toch notes that the important economic developments of the sixteenth century 4.

One interpretation idealized Jewish life as one of genuine simplicity, inner Jewish solidarity, and religious unity. The other embraced a lachrymose conception of Jewish history that finds a chain of persecution running through the past. Treue rejects both interpretations as oversimplifications of what was a complicated relationship between Jews and Christians, who lived not only in proximity but frequently wall to wall or even under one roof.15 J. Friedrich Battenberg similarly points out that the diversity and wide-ranging settlement patterns that differentiated German Jewry after 1650 forbid a uniform answer to the question about how Jews and Christians inter acted. What is clear, Battenberg argues, is that simple categories of integration and separation fail to capture the complexity of these relations.16 Given that early modern Jews and Christians likely interacted much more than once assumed, their intellectual, cultural, and social encounters need to be examined closely. As Karl Gr?zinger has pointed out, even some Jewish legends, such as those related to the ba 'al shem, drew from older Jewish sources but also imbibed non Jewish traditions.17 The same appears to be true of Jewish and Christian messianic traditions, which, according to Elisheva Carlebach, "collided, intersected, and reverberated in an endless cycle which continually revised and reworked mutual per ceptions and definitions."18 Jews and Christians interacted more frequently and pro ductively and at more diverse levels than once thought. Jewish culture was, therefore, 11. Michael Toch, "Wirtschaft und Geldwesen der Juden Frankfurts im Sp?tmittelalter und in der Fr?hen Neuzeit," in Gr?zinger, J?dische Kultur in Frankfurt, 25-46. 12.

As Rohrbacher notes in writing about Jews in early modern Swabia, "Jews live in their own circles and in their own culture; but they do not isolate themselves herme tically from their Christian surroundings, rather they always absorb diverse influ ences from them."20 In social relations as well, some historians stress that Jews and Christians lived in close proximity, participating in the broader society without becoming completely assimilated into the surrounding culture. In a provoca tive study of the small village of Steinbiedersdorf, located southeast of Metz on the German and French border, in the eighteenth century, Claudia Ulbrich argues that village social order was built on inequality but grounded in plurality, so that Jews (like women) might be marginalized but nonetheless simultaneously central to village life. Though early modern German Jews probably never fully adopted the culture or intellectual approaches of their neighbors, various cultural practices or intellectual orientations seeped into their communities, practices, and worldviews. As recent research has revealed, such acculturation21 and cultural transfer22 could be rich and complex processes that help us to understand the interaction and relation of different people, cultures, or religions. Christian representations of Jews in early modern Germany have tradition ally been portrayed as fundamentally negative, with anti-Jewish motifs running through a full range of Christian writings and images.23 Indeed, anti-Jewish occur rences spiked on several occasions during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centu ries,24 and a variety of anti-Jewish persecutions and writings date from the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Toch argues that there were two primary motivations for the persecution of Jews in late medieval and early modern Germany. Each motivation had both direct and indirect accusations. On the one hand, Jews were accused of wreaking religious damage, directly through the dese cration of religious images and objects (such as the host) and indirectly by leading Christians to sin more generally. Second, Jews were accused of causing vol. 1, Jewish Messianism in the Early Modern World, ed. Matt D. Goldish and Richard H. Popkin (Dordrecht: Kluwer), 125. 19.

Maria R. Boes asserts that Jews received heavier doses of torture than Christians when suspected of crimes26 and that, more specifically, "Frankfurt's laws and arrest procedures give clear evidence of disparaging judicial treatment of Jews, and its criminal court proceedings display evidence of more subtle disparities, such as ignoring traditional exculpatory devices."27 What is more, Boes notes a dra matic increase in the convictions of Jews in the last four decades of the seventeenth century.28 Whereas only thirty-four male Jews were sentenced in Frankfurt between 1562 and 1661, in the next thirty-six years there were sixty, representing the most erratic jump of any of Frankfurt's criminal groups.29 Boes also finds that there were discrepancies between Christian and Jewish offenders evident in the types of capital punishment that Jews suffered. (The failure of convicted Jews to convert always resulted in harsher penalties.30) Boes concludes, "Public anti-Jewish out bursts, such as the 1614 Fettmilch uprising, were replaced by more 'refined' judicial attacks. The court system served as a veiled discriminatory weapon."31 Many scholars have pointed out that anti-Judaism could be a part of larger politics32 and even a form of social protest.33 Though some have discerned an easing of anti-Jewish polemic by the end of the sixteenth century, the process of confessionalization and the economic developments of the early seventeenth century may have led to a complicated and volatile political environment for Jews.34 At times, policies related to Jews had very little to do with Jews 25.

In assessing the role of Jews and Judaism for the Protestant reformers, Achim Detmers has recently argued that most images of Jews in the Reformation were based on sociological and social-psychological stereotypes and prejudices rather than social experience. As such, teachings about Israel and Judaism served to create a fundamental oppositional image that could be utilized in the process of Christian self-understanding.35 In the theological developments of the Reformation period, including apocalyptic thinking, Jews, whether real or imagined, could play an important, even central, role.36 On the other hand, much scholarship of the past decade has asserted that early modem German Jews were not always represented in a purely negative light. One German literature scholar contends that medieval and early modem German Chris tians were well aware that their religion had Jewish roots and that there in fact existed a variety of complex and ambivalent images of literary Jews, some that were even positive.37 Jews, according to this argument, were not always depicted as monstrous; rather, they could be portrayed as people searching for godly truth. When they were presented in negative light, Jews were more likely to be seen as the dupes of evil, not its willing agents. In his popular seventeenth-century literary production Simplicissimus, Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen, for example, presented an image of Jews that was not always negative but in which Jews were frequently seen as manipulative, greedy and socially marginal.38 Still, Grimmelshausen did not generally focus on Jews, who in any event were only one small piece of a more general social and moral decline that he described. The historian Rolf Kiessling cautions that even in the anti-usury campaigns of the second half of the sixteenth century, attention was not directed at Jews alone.39 35.

C. von Grimmelshausen, The Adventurous Simplicissimus (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1962). The Jew is presented in a nonpolemical way as a money changer or pawnbroker (49) but also less "positively" as rogue (57), gamer (126), and usurer (referring to "the Jews' spear," which is frequently depicted in illustrated broadsheets of the time, 280). Jews are presented as notor iously seeking economic gain (294), as the consummate bargainers (329) but also, on one occasion, dredging up more "theological" constructs, as the stoners of Christ (373). The "Jewish spear" was an image used in the sixteenth century to denote usury and unfair financial practices. The term appears in Sebasian Brant's Das Narrenschiff, and the image is used in several illustrated pamphlets in the sixteenth century.

According to Udo Arnoldi, in Halle, "with variable success theologians stood up for domestic and foreign Jews in the face of unjustified accusations and fought for the respect of their freedom of religion and conscience."41 Recent studies have shown that Jews themselves might have had close social relationships with and complex representations of non-Jews.42 Jews sometimes portrayed Christians neutrally or even in a positive light.43 In some cases, we have intriguing examples of extensive Jewish and Christian cooperation in com munal governance, such as in the so-called double-communities identified by Rolf Kiessling and Sabine Ulimann in the margravate of Burgau in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.44 Until recently historians have often cast Jewish and Christian encounters in early modern Germany as tense and frequently negative. The scholarship of the past decade has helped scholars to draw a more nuanced picture of early modern German Jewish life and now forces us to question traditional interpret ations. Though the position of Jews varied greatly because of many different factors, including religious, political, and economic developments, it now appears that Jews and Christians interacted in a wide range of ways, with many intellectual, cultural, and social encounters that both differentiated and united Jews and Christians. How, then, should we understand the position of Jews in early modem Germany? How did Christians and Jews depict each other, and for what purposes? Though most studies have focused on direct encounters between Jews and Chris tians?for example, in theological discussions and debates, legislation, and econ omic interaction?some recent studies have asked how Jews and Christians may 40.

In contribut ing to the evaluation of Jewish and Christian interaction in early modern Germany, in what follows, I examine how Jews and Christians represented each other in what was ostensibly a "neutral" or common field, one that affected everyone (even if not equally in all regards), namely, descriptions of environmental conditions. First, I ask whether Jews were depicted in relation to the significant climatic changes of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and if so, in what ways. Second, I ask how Jews themselves thought about and described climatic severities and, in the process, how they engaged Christian sources and evaluated broader society. The answers to these questions suggest that Jewish and Christian encounters were rich and complex and that we need to consider them in a broader field of meaning that takes into account then-current cultural perspectives and worldviews. The Little Ice Age: A Context Individual climatic crises between 1570 and 1630, and especially between 1585 and 1614,46 were more frequent and severe than in any other period of the past thousand years, with the exception of the fifth decade of the fourteenth century.47 As a whole, the period was characterized by decreasing temperatures (on average, throughout the year, between one and two degrees centigrade lower than average temperatures)48 and severe storms. These climatic shifts had a signifi cant impact on agriculture and, subsequently, the availability and price of foodstuffs, affecting daily subsistence as well as regional and global markets. Already by 1572, the price of foodstuffs in some places had increased 37 percent from the prices of the late 1560s. The price of grain, in particular, increased 400 percent in some areas.49 The severe climate did not affect all parts of Germany to the same degree or at the same time. The weather and its accompanying challenges varied in kind, intensity, and by region. Severe plagues, in part the result of climate change, for 45.

In some places there were heavy storm floods and in others extreme winter cold. The Basel chronicler Peter Ryff, for example, who extended the chronicle of Fridolin Ryff that covered much of the first half of the sixteenth century from 1543 until 1585, described in detail the severe flooding of the Rhine in 1570 and its freezing over in 1572.51 The devastation wreaked by such natural events was recorded in texts as well as in visual arts. Two small woodcuts from Basel in 1572-73, with explanatory songs, printed by Samuel Apiarius, for example, depicted severe flooding in Fulda and a ter rifying lightening storm in 1572, both seen as manifestations of God's anger.52 Cyria cus Spangenberg, whom we will meet more formally later, also noted powerful and destructive storms, as well as large snowfalls, in the late 1560s and into the 1570s,53 which, he wrote, were seen by many as a sign of the End of Days.54 50.

Added to the challenges caused by severe weather patterns, of course, were the devastations of the Thirty Years' War, which themselves fostered grave economic hardships and fre quent famines, particularly during the 1620s.

Okes, 1638). In many places, the Thirty Years' War had remarkable demographic, economic, and political effects. In the Duchy of W?rttemberg, by 1640, the population had declined to one quarter of the prewar level (Bernhard Stier and Wolfgang von Hippel, "War, Economy, and Society," in Germany: A New Social and Economic History, volume II, 1630-1800, ed. Sheilagh Ogilvie [London: Hodder Arnold, 1996], 235). Augsburg in 1600 had 45,000 inhabitants; by 1635, however, the city was inhabited by only 16,000 people. Between 1632 and 1635, Mainz lost 8,000 people (half of its inhabitants). Such proportional population losses could be experienced in any size town. Although the population losses could be quite significant and in some places long lasting, as a rule, urban populations tended to recover quickly. The war had other serious consequences besides population loss, however. Between 1625 and 1647, the prosperous and densely populated area around Magdeburg and Halberstadt lost an average of 64 percent of its dwellings through direct combat, dilapidation, plundering, and arson (ibid., 240). The indebtedness of Nuremberg rose from 1.8 million Gulden in 1618 to 7.4 million in 1648 (ibid., 241). 9</page><page sequence="10">Dean Phillip Bell In addition to more tangible concerns, some scholars have recently begun to explore the various cultural consequences of the events of this dramatic period, referred to in the scholarly literature as the "little ice age" and seen as part of the more general "crisis of the seventeenth century," which also included revolts spurred by social and economic concerns, as well as political consolidation and concomitant warfare.55 The traditional "economy of sin," by which early moderns saw moral lapses as the cause of various natural disasters, remained regnant, even when more "scientific" concepts were forwarded (such as those distinguishing between primary and secondary causes)56 to explain the changing environment. The Pro testant theologian Johannes Brenz (1499-1570), for example, in a sermon preached on the occasion of a severe hailstorm and published in 1570, recognized "natural" explanations for the hail before assigning causality to God's punishment for human sins. God directed the hail at the vineyards and fields, he argued, because people sinned with both wine and grain.57 But the period of the "little ice age" ushered in important new theological and cultural discussions as well. For many contemporary witnesses, the period appeared to be the beginning of the apocalypse. Many different "signs" were inter preted as demonstration of either God's warnings or punishment. Tales and visual depictions of fire or blood falling from the sky combined with accounts of earth quakes across the globe, ominous rainbows, and the (increasingly common) appearance of portents such as comets and three suns in the sky.58 The volume of works with eschatological content, not surprisingly, appears to have increased dramatically in this period.59 A survey of German chronicles from the fifteenth through the late sixteenth century also reveals a telling shift in language. Whereas the earlier accounts described natural climatic aberrations as "large" or "great" (gross), a term used extensively and very generically through out the later Middle Ages, accounts from the later sixteenth century began more frequently to present them as "frightening," "dreadful," or "scary" (erschrecklich). Such linguistic shifts are noticeable in other sources as well. The theologian Heinrich Bullinger, for example, began to use more pointed language in his diary entries recording extreme weather in the early 1560s, correlating to a period of increased apocalyptic discussion in his writings. According to the historian Otto Ulbricht, Bullinger utilized words such as "horrifying" and "gruesome" 55. Among the older literature, see Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M.

(Early modern writers at times depicted some weather severities, such as hail, as the work of witches.) What makes this change so intriguing is that it was clearly tied to broader changes in theological discussions about society. For Bullinger, as for many other religious thinkers, severe weather was not simply a punishment from God; it was also a warning from him.60 Bullinger read the crises of the early 1570s as a call to return to God and to overcome several significant contemporary social ills. He argued, for example, that these warning signs pointed to the need to direct the battle against alcoholism not only to the common man but also to the upper levels of both the ecclesiastical and secular worlds. Bullinger noted that the high price of grain, which was caused in part by the severe climate, led to a situation of intensive credit with exorbitant increases in interest rates.61 Bul linger, therefore, used this situation as an opportunity to speak out against unfair grain pricing and the hoarding of grain in granaries, both benefiting the wealthy and keeping prices high for the poor.62 In summary, whether viewed materially, "scientifically," or theologically, early modern people saw severe weather as a punishment or warning from God. Increasingly, as German weather became more extreme, early modern writers associated it with more dramatic events, such as witchcraft, heresy, and even the End of Days. Extreme weather frequently also became a tool through which early modern moralists could identify social ills and encourage moral repentance. Given this condition and the complicated, and at times marginalized, position of the Jews in early modern society, it is tempting to ask?as we now will?how, if at all, Jews fit in to and engaged this discourse. Evaluation Early modern German writers at times associated Jews with plague and disease. They saw Jews collectively as synonymous with plague and misfortune,63 typified by Martin Luther when he wrote that Jews "are a heavy burden, like a plague, pestilence and pure misfortune in our land."64 Nevertheless, Jews in early modern Germany were not generally depicted as being directly responsible for natural disasters or severe weather.65 Jews were, however, frequently seen as 60. Otto Ulbricht, "Extreme Wetterlagen im Diarium Heinrich Bullingers (1504-1574)," in Behringer, Lehmann, and Pfister, Kulturelle Konsequenzen der 'Kleinen Eiszeit', 161. 61. The city council, as a consequence, in 1567 reinstituted the 1529 limit on interest to 5 percent and extended its preaching about the punishment for usury. 62.

The black death, e.g., was at times attributed to the Jews in late medieval and early modern chronicles; however, this was not uniformly the case. Frequently authors with more clerical back grounds were more likely to disseminate the motif of Jewish guilt, though many Christian chroniclers 11</page><page sequence="12">Dean Phillip Bell benefiting from the disasters or using them as opportunities to forward their own alleged animosity against the Christian world. To give only one example, Johannes Aventinus (1477-1534), in his Bavarian Chronicle, discussed the attack on Jews just after he described a comet and just before he mentioned an infestation of grasshoppers?a "plague from God." The context for the anti-Jewish passage was the belief that Jews?supposed enemies to both empire and Christianity? were forming a great league throughout Germany against Christians. Specifically, they allegedly intended to poison Christians and steal the host, throwing it in the oven as well as committing several other offenses to it.66 The Jews were not directly related to either the preceding or following events that Aventinus narrated, though all apparently were manifestations of God's displeasure with Germany. The most direct representation of Jews in the context of severe weather that I have found comes from several illustrated broadsheets, primarily from the early seventeenth century. These images, as we will see, were about a good deal more than Jews. The depiction of Jews as unscrupulous traders and monopolizers, however, took on new meaning in the seventeenth century as Jews more frequently became involved in specialized cattle and horse business and as they became more involved in trade in leather, cloth, wool, and especially wine.67 The representation of Jews was also sharpened by the agricultural and economic crises of the little ice age. The 1629 illustration "Der Wein Jud" from Trier (figure l)68 contains a number of "weather scenes" and also presents a stereotypical image of a Jew as a monopolizer (and agent of the devil). The Janus-faced Jew is described as lending to the poor, and thereby he is literally depicted as taking the poor prisoner. Interestingly, the illustrator further associated the Jew with the corruption of the church; from the bottom of the Jew's cart appears the abbreviation "ROMA" (Radix Omnivm Malorvm Avaritia, "the root of all evil is greed"). The Jew, with beard and demarcating circle on his breast, carries a flag that reads "monopoly" (Monopolium). He is outfitted with a flaying knife and what appear to be sacks of money. He sits atop a barrel that reads, "everything [is] in my barrel." On the front wheel of the carriage are three words: "sales," "profit," and "finance" (Vorkauff, Forthel, Finantz). On the rear wheel are another three words: "excess," "fraud," and "treachery" (Ubergemeisen, Betrug, Hinderlist). Etched in the hills on either side of the wine Jew are two statements: "lies in the land" and "lies in the barrel." At the front of the Jew's barrel coach is a devil with a whip leading the coach into the flaming jaws of Hell (above him is written, "The path of Baalam the unrighteous leads"). Three creatures (which appear to be lions and wolves), never mentioned the Jews at all. The weather, though apparently attributed by some, especially in popular culture, to witches and devils, was not generally seen by theologians as susceptible to their power. 66.

At the rear of the coach is a fox holding a net that has entrapped the poor people. Above, the illustrator placed a quote attributed to Psalm 10 but replaced the biblical lion with a fox waiting covertly to seize the lowly, pulling his net shut and preying on the hapless. Of course, Psalm 10 ends with a plea to God not to forget the lowly, to break the power of the wicked and evil man and champion the downtrodden, a message perhaps implied in the moral of the illustration. The early seventeenth-century illustrator embedded the image with numer ous quotes, some of them biblical passages. A review of some of the more promi nent quotations tells us a good deal about the message the illustrator sought to convey. Across the illustration are numerous weather depictions, each with an accompanying biblical passage. At the top left of the illustration, below the rain, we find a passage from Psalm 11, "He serves you a storm for a punishment."69 69. "Er wirt ihnen ein wetter zu lohn geben." The actual Psalm reads, "The Lord seeks out the righteous man, but loathes the wicked one who loves injustice. He will rain down upon the wicked blazing coals and sulfur; a scorching wind shall be their lot" (Psalms 11:5-6). 13</page><page sequence="14">Dean Phillip Bell In the cloud to the right of this first image, a caption is added, "I will command the clouds not to rain."70 This passage, from Isaiah, refers to God's punishment, his destruction of man's vineyard in response to a litany of human sins, most specifi cally inequality and intoxication. The withering vineyards depicted below reinforced the significance of the biblical passage. The illustrator placed another biblical passage, from Isaiah (5:Iff, 10), below the fields and above and below a caravan of barrels and four figures involved in what appears to be some sort of financial transaction. The text reads, "My beloved had a vineyard and expected that it would yield grapes but it yielded bitterness. Ten acres will only yield one measure."71 Indeed, Isaiah 5 castigates those who chase liquor and are inflamed by wine while giving no heed to the multitudes suffering hunger and thirst?that is why God's anger was roused and he made the mountains quake. The illustration also includes, within the cloud to the far right, a passage from Amos: "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the land on the holy day."72 This is again a particularly relevant text, recounting as it does earthquakes, rising rivers, and famines as punishment for those devouring the needy and annihilating the poor through dishonest pricing of grain! The theme of miserliness is addressed in several places in the illustration, notably by the well to the right of the wine Jew. One of the accompanying passages reads, "Just as a well pours forth its water, so miserliness pours forth its evil." Similarly, the storeroom of wine barrels in the upper-right corner of the illustration contains three devils draining wine barrels and a text that scolds the person who believes that the collecting of wine will bring him good cheer. Indeed, the title of the illustration itself announces, "The Wine Jew. Miserliness is a root of all evil, which quite a lot desire and which comes from confusion of belief and makes people very futilely restless."73 The bottom of the image contains passages from Amos 5 and Psalm 58 that complete the moral: Therefore, because you oppress the poor and take the grain from them with great burdens, so you should not live in the houses that you have built with workpieces [hewn stone], and not drink the wine that you planted in the choice vineyards, for I know your violations, which are many, and your sin that is strong, how you have compelled the righteous and taken blood money. And the poor are oppressed at the gate. Therefore, the intelligent person at the same time must remain silent, for it is an evil time. The righteous man will rejoice when he sees such vengeance.

As Amos con tinues (not quoted here), in the midst of the tirade against Israel's poor behavior, there is a brief encouragement to "Seek good and not evil, that you may live, and that the Lord, the God of Hosts, may truly be with you, as you think. Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in the gate; Perhaps the Lord, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph" (Amos 5:13-15). Given the great shortages in grain spurred by the significant climatic changes, it is perhaps not too surprising to find the Jews represented as being associated with the shady business of taking advantage of the poor. Indeed, the "Korn Jude" (Grain Jew) became a well-circulated theme in the early seventeenth-century illustrated broadsheets (Flugbl?tter). But this was also a time when other, almost counter images, such as corn falling from the sky, as well as stories of magical flour75 (a tiny amount of which baked much bread76), were also circulating.77 In this context, some early modern German illustrators portrayed Jews as part of a general plot to harm the poor and juxtaposed them against the divine assistance being delivered at times to the deserving poor. In many contemporary images, the Jew was portrayed as the embodiment of the dire straits facing the poor. Yet the position of the Jew was itself somewhat ambiguous. The Jew was depicted negatively, but in the middle ground between good and evil, perhaps representing the choice that individuals are forced to make in the world. In an image from the early seventeenth century (figure 2),78 the illustrator presents a Janus-faced wine Jew in the center?the figure has a beard but no other apparent "Jewish" physical attributes or marks other than the title of "wine Jew" on the chest of the barrel covering his torso. Curiously, the only figure that has a traditionally Jewish appearance?horns, hat, and elongated nose?also has wings and appears to be a devil of some sort, holding an account ing tablet and sitting near someone sick and sleeping in bed and about to be devoured by the jaws of Hell. To the left of the Jew is an image of the biblical Moses holding the Ten Commandments, to the right the mouth of Hell. The author of the text explains Moses's teaching regarding loving one's neighbor as his own blood. The Moses figure does not appear to be overtly caricatured or demarcated as a Jew, suggesting perhaps that the topic at hand is a more general Christian moral issue that has nothing directly to do with Jews. und den Wein nicht trincken, den ihr in den feinen Weinbergen gepflantzet habt, Danichweis ewer uber tretten, des vil ist, und ewere s?nd die starck sind, wie ihr die gerechten drenget, und blutgelt nemet.

In the accompanying text, the Jew is, in fact, described in his profession as both dangerous?he skewers the poor with his spear?and lazy (like a donkey). In the text, the author narrates the precarious position of the poor people and the simultaneous proliferation of usury, miserliness, and the excessive pricing and hording of grain and wine. The weather and the Jew, then, are agents of destruction sent by God to punish a not yet repentant society. According to the text, the Jew is hardened in evil nature {verhart im b?sen Wesn) and, undeterred by the moral instruction of the Mosaic Law, helps himself from the barrel what he did not drain from usury. The moneybags at the feet of the Jew represent miserliness. Although financial wealth leads to arrogance, the text points out that such financial strength seldom lasts and that God soon brings such people to shame. The text ends with a warning to such miserly and usurious people. In these illustrations and a range of contemporary writings, God controlled the weather and used it as a punishment for sinful behavior. Jews, however, in this context, served as God's vehicle for natural punishment. Though the resultant images were obviously anti-Jewish, they do not appear to be at their heart intended to address Jews. The Jews had no supernatural power over things such as the weather; rather, they were used as polemical straw men against which repentant Christians could focus their energies. In fact, Jews were not the sole or central embodiment of usury, distrust, immorality, hoarding essential goods for later profit79 or the debasing of money.80 The creators of many early seventeenth century illustrated broadsheets frequently addressed what was perceived as a general lack of Christian love and the problem of rich Christians themselves exploiting and devouring the poor. Indeed, the broadsheets malign a number of groups, including the wealthy and especially the Jesuits.81 On the other hand, most of the illustrated broadsheets that represent the impact of war and inflation make no mention of the Jews at all.82 The Jews were part of a broader criticism of society and moral values, serving as a sordid element to be shunned, on the one hand, and a reminder of the need for repentance, on the other. Jewish Accounts of Severe Weather How did early modern German Jews describe severe weather? Though our sources are somewhat limited, there are some intriguing exceptions. These include the memoirs of Asher Levy of Reichshofen and David Gans's Zemah David. To what extent do accounts of the harsh climate presented in these texts resonate 79.

To give one, albeit late, example, from 1701, there was a Polish nobleman who possessed much grain but could not sell it for the planned exorbitant price; he resolved therefore to give it to the pigs rather than sell it to the poor cheaply. For that deed, God turned him into a pig to serve as an example. 82. Ibid., 377, 424. 17</page><page sequence="18">Dean Phillip Bell with, or even borrow from, Christian representations, and to what extent do they reflect personal or specifically Jewish concerns and perspectives? In his memoirs, Asher Levy (1598-1635) of Reichshofen, in Alsace, mixed chronicle narrative and personal reflection. Levy, the son of Eliezer ha-Levy and relative of Cerf Levy in Metz (the second husband of the famous memoirist Gl?ckel of Hameln), compiled part of the memoirs in Reichshofen after 1620 and part in Oberbronn in 1633;83 he completed the memoirs during the winter of 1634-35.84 Asher described his work in the following terms: And I would like the day of death to be as the day of birth, without sin and free of guilt. Therefore, I decided to register with honorable pen for the preser vation of the good and the evil, everything that befell me, to thank and to praise for everything ... I have added, at the conclusion of the book, to record everything that has happened to my children ... And further, I have added there news, that which has happened to the Jewish people in my time, beginning with the day of my birth, Friday, the 3rd of Ellul 358 (1598).85 Accordingly, Asher related many events that he witnessed or heard about himself. In the memoirs, Asher cobbled together a variety of events and observations. Throughout, he stressed the importance of study. His memoirs offer a rich portal into aspects of early modern Jewish life. Though Asher certainly captured some of the broader imperial events of his day, particularly as they were being played out in the Thirty Years' War,86 he generally linked such reflections to the experiences of Jews or his own family. Indeed, flowing through the memoirs were recollections of family87 and great Jewish sages.88 Perhaps even more striking was the moral and confessional tone that Asher adopted in much of his writing. Like other writers we have seen in the early modern period, Asher was quick to point out the effects of "our many sins"?as in large numbers of deaths or more general suffering.89 Like most chroniclers of the period, Asher discussed a variety of environmental conditions, such as floods and droughts.90 Asher Levy's memoirs, therefore, provide one source for evaluating Jewish depictions of extreme weather. In most of his accounts of bad weather, Asher restated the basic weather irregularities?excessive rain and subsequent flooding, colder temperatures than usual, strong winds, and so on. Frequently he noted the results of such extreme weather, particularly on the availability or price of 83. M.

For the summer of 1626, for example, he wrote that it was extremely rainy and damp, with the sun appearing only a few days. "And it was a time of emergency for the people," he recorded, "for it was feared that everything would be ruined if God would not be merciful. But, thank God, it was a blessed year and there were many grains in this land of the city Weissenburg until Basel, as it had not been since the memory of man. Even our fathers had not told us the equal."96 After detailing the extensive crop of fruit and the price of grain, Asher narrated a fall in price, concluding that "we hope that it will become still cheaper, if it is the will of God."97 Similarly, in describing the sudden reappearance of the sun after an exten sive rainfall in the month of Sivan, 1627, leading to abundant crops and reasonable prices, Asher wrote "that the rule of God is wondrous and that His kindness [Gnade; hesed] is not turned from us."98 God, in the memoirs, did not simply redeem. He also allowed nature to wreak havoc. Asher noted, At the beginning of the summer, that is [in] Iyar and Sivan [1632], all the grass of the fields began to shoot up, and the grains and the vines showed blossoms, 91. See, e.g., ibid., 29 [Hebrew 16], 38 [Hebrew 22], 57 [Hebrew 36]. 92. In the context of war, Asher resorts to explanation by sin: "Now, because of our many sins, I was forced with them to flee" (ibid., 57 [Hebrew 36]). 93. Asher writes, e.g., "The entire month of Tevet 386 (1626) it was not cold and there was no snow, and at the beginning of Shevat the sun was so warm just as in the days of the summer, and this is how it remained until the end of Shevat, and each day there was dew on the ground. At the beginning of Adar it was cold and snow fell, and the land was frozen and it snowed very heavily" (ibid., 24 [Hebrew 12]). 94. Ibid., 39 [Hebrew 25]. 95. Of a 1633 flood, e.g., he writes tellingly, "On Shabbat, the 11th of Shevat, the water began to gain the upper hand, for during the entire preceding weeks there was rain and wind, as it is not possible to describe, storms, which ripped the mountains and uprooted fir trees, and the water gained the upper hand in the entire region. On Wednesday, the fifteenth, it ceased. No one can recall such an amount of water and many men and cattle were lost; it was especially strong in Hagenau" (ibid., 57-58 [Hebrew 37]). A similarly broad description is provided for 1631 : "The cold began with strength on the holiday of Chanukah and did not end for 13 days, and all the world was afraid that the Rhine would freeze and the army of the Emperor would come from the other bank. Suddenly the rainfall came and the cold snapped. A second cold period set in with the 26th of Tevet" (ibid., 67 [Hebrew 41]). 96. Ibid., 27 [Hebrew 15]. 97. Ibid., 28 [Hebrew 15]. 98.

But God showed his wonder and allowed an East wind to blow, and a great cold came [at the] end of Sivan and also in Tammuz; until the middle of the month it was cold and always [there was] rain and wind without interruption, so that everyone doubted if there would still be wine and fruits, and all prayed to Him who allowed the wind to blow. And on the day of rest of the parsha Balak, on the 17th of Tammuz, the clouds dispersed and the sun appeared, as it should be at the time ... and we hope that not so much damage occurred to the fruit trees and to the grains, if God wills." Asher's accounts read very much like those of contemporary German chronicles. In fact, some of the language of the German accounts clearly seeped through into his writing. Asher alternated, for example, between Hebrew terms for devastation and the replication of German terms such as Schaden in Hebrew letters, and many of his expressions mirrored those in German accounts. Curiously, although he infused his memoirs with reflections on personal shortcomings and the need for penance, and although there were plenty of examples of early modern Jewish reflection on the "economy of sin" to be found, Asher tended not to explain weather as the result of human sin. Asher's account was also not apocalyptic in outlook. Instead, he focused on God's power and the economic effects of harsh weather. Asher did not generally present Jews as a separate group in society; rather, the Jews he chronicled formed part of the general community. David Gans also discussed unusual weather in many places in his chronicle Zemah David. In what follows, I focus on a comparison of his work and one of his primary sources, Cyriacus Spangenberg's 1585 Saxon Chronicle {S?chsische Chronica). David Gans (1541-1613) was simultaneously a chronicler, an astronomer, and a mathematician. Born in Westphalia in 1541, he studied Talmud at Bonn and Frankfurt. Later, he studied with Moses Isserles in Cracow, and he held the rabbinic title morenu ha-rav.100 After 1564 he settled in Prague, where he engaged in business. His masterful chronicle Zemah David was first published in 1592 but was expanded during the course of the seventeenth century. Gans's chronicle comprises two parts, one on Jewish history and one on general history.101 Although Gans studied with a number of prominent rabbis and relied heavily upon the work of earlier Jewish scholars such as Ibn Daud and Zacuto, 99.

In some cases he seems to have evaluated them critically, whereas at other times he accepted the information they relayed as a matter of course.109 Overall, Gans's historical Kirchen-und Universalgeschichtsschreibung 1546-1617 (T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007), regarding universal and church history in the sixteenth century in the context of confessionalization. 102.

Indeed, the tensions in Gans's project and his outlook in general have been well stated with regard to his relation to science. According to Andre Neher, Jewish Thought and the Scientific Revolu tion of the Sixteenth Century: David Gans (1541-1613) and his Times, trans. David Maisel (Oxford: Littman Library, Oxford University Press, 1986), 214, "Three ways, then, opened up for David Gans: that of submission to the authority of the Gentiles and acceptance of the Ptolemaic system, whose chief Jewish representative was the great Moses Maimonides; that of the Maharal, who also recognized the scientific supremacy of Gentile astronomy, but placed above it a purely Jewish astron omy which, however, is not scientific and is the only one to possess the absolute truth. And, lastly, there was that of the Rema, with his very vague and generalized approach of a simultaneous respect for Jewish tradition and the Ptolemaic system, ended in a state of painful anxiety."

There Gans noted that "the words of this second part from the writings of the books of the Greeks and from other books of foreigners" were not meant to be equivalent to, or worse, to uproot Jewish law and tradition.116 Gans saw clearly that he would be attacked for his use of non-Jewish sources,117 but he responded that other Jewish writers had utilized non-Jewish sources, and he asserted that scripture itself "has allowed us to search in non Jewish books for accounts of events which can be of some use to us."118 Gans identified a variety of benefits from the use of the accounts in this section, as well as the use of non-Jewish sources more generally.119 Of particular note for our topic are the following benefits: evidence of Divine Providence; evidence that God, in his justice, punishes the wicked even in this world; and the importance of the ability to understand the meaning of celestial signs. Whereas Gans focused the first book of the chronicle on key rabbinic figures, in book two he lavished his 110. Ibid., 60. 111.

In this regard, book two mirrors very closely contemporary non Jewish chronicles. One of the sources?Jewish or non-Jewish?Gans cited most often was the Saxon Chronicle of Cyriacus Spangenberg. Gans cited this work directly more than 110 times, just slightly less than the most frequently cited work Sefer Yuhasin of Abraham Zacuto (1452-c. 1515). Spangenberg (1528-1604) was born in Nordhausen and died in Strasbourg. Having studied in Wittenberg, he was a teacher and priest in Eisleben and later in Mansfeld and Schlitz. Accused by some of heretical leanings, he appears to have been involved with the spread of Lutheranism in the Netherlands. His chronicle was popular and itself drew from a wide array of sources. The volume contains a range of very stock and often recycled images and a good deal of information on natural disasters and celestial omens. It is cast as a universal history from the time of creation, with a special focus on the history of Saxony. Interestingly, Gans also drew from other popular contemporary accounts. He took much of his rich collection of infor mation on various comets, celestial signs, and portents, for example, from Georg Caesius's (1542-1604) Chronik, oder ordenliche Verzeichnu? unnd bes chreibung aller Cometen (Nuremberg, 1579). In part two of Zemah David, Gans narrated severe weather and a range of natural disasters, especially earthquakes. For the (contemporary) later sixteenth century, for example, Gans mentioned earthquakes in Ferrara in 1571, Constanti nople in 1572, Rome in 1580, Uechtland in 1584, and Vienna in 1590.120 In most of his accounts of poor weather conditions, however, Gans described events from earlier historical periods. Unlike Spangenberg, who devoted significant space to the harsh weather of the late 1560s and early 1570s, Gans was silent. There may be a variety of reasons for this silence?perhaps the imperial politics he described throughout part two were more immediately relevant to his readers; perhaps the climatic situation around Prague was less severe; or perhaps Gans found other portents to be more significant. Similarly, though the author of the Anonymous Hebrew Chronicle from Prague from the early seventeenth century mentioned flooding in Prague in the early sixteenth century121 and various celes tial signs throughout the sixteenth century,122 he also focused primary attention for the later sixteenth century on imperial politics. In describing the earthquakes and bad weather of the year 822-23, Gans quoted Spangenberg closely, but with a few differences. Describing the heavy 120.

The chronicler did note a fire in the Jewish street in Prague in 1559 (and the associated death of a woman attributed to "our iniquities") and registered floods in the city that forced the temporary closure of the Altneuschul in 1598 (53). Though a comet was described from 1577 as an omen that God would hopefully regard as good and a blessing (52), the floodwaters were not presented within a divine context and not described as punish ment for sin (53). 122. Ibid., 38, 40, 44, for example 23</page><page sequence="24">Dean Phillip Bell hail that fell in Burgundy, Gans, like Spangenberg, noted that fields and fruit were destroyed. The accounts were not identical, however. Gans located the death of many people and animals in Burgundy, which Spangenberg discussed under similar circumstances in Saxony. Gans also left out some details, such as specific measurements. The most pronounced difference is that Gans added at the end of his account that "there was nothing like it since the days of Pharaoh." This phrase would likely have resonated with a reader of the Hebrew Bible, who would have recalled the plague of hail depicted in Exodus 9:17ff, in which God declares, "You are still oppressing my people, not to send them out. Behold at this time tomorrow I shall rain a very heavy hail, such as there has never been in Egypt, from the day it was formed until now." The hail of Exodus 9, however, did not simply destroy crops indiscriminately. It did not rain upon the biblical Israelites in Goshen and those even among Pharaoh's servants who heeded God's warnings and removed their servants and livestock from the fields were spared this destruction (Exodus 9:20-21). What is more, in this biblical recounting, Pharaoh himself admits that he has sinned and that his people are wicked, whereas the God of the Hebrews is righteous (Exodus 9:27). Early modern German Christians made reference to this biblical passage as well. Johannes Brenz, in his hail sermon, for example, wrote, "In the second book of Moses in the ninth chapter, we read that God commanded Moses that he should stretch out his hand [so] that it would hail over all the land of Egypt, upon men and cattle. See, it is openly shown that God is the cause of the hail and [he] sends it because He wants to punish men for sins and malice with it."123 In another sermon that was published in 1570 along with Brenz's, the author, Thoman R?rer, made much the same argument, adding, however, the detail that while the rest of Egypt was afflicted by the hail, the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel lived, was not damaged.124 As early modern Christians cast themselves as biblical Israelites, they could drive home the message that they were punished for their sins but also spared because of their status as God's (new) chosen people. In referencing the biblical account in his description of the hail, Gans made the event relevant within a longer historical and Jewish framework. He connected his Jewish readers to the biblical Israelites in something of an unbroken tradition while sim ultaneously allowing the attentive reader potentially to draw a comparison between the effects of the hail's destruction on those persecuting the Jews at various times in history.125 This connection could be particularly meaningful in the late sixteenth century as Christians increasingly appropriated Israelite identity from the Hebrew Bible.126 123.

See Bell, Jewish Identity in Early Modern Germany, 106-107, 112. 24</page><page sequence="25">The Little Ice Age and the Jews In depicting the great heat of 1473, Gans, not surprisingly, avoided the use of Christian holy days for dating purposes. Like Spangenberg, he reported that there was not grain to be ground for bread and that water was scarce and expensive. He did not mention that the Donau River was much reduced, but he did move on, like Spangenberg, to record the fires that ravaged Bohemia and Thuringia. Though he followed Spangenberg fairly closely in these events, Gans was much more expansive in his description of the cold winter. Spangenberg simply wrote that the ensuing winter was very cold and severe (heftig). Gans added the detail, almost formulaic in early modern German chronicles, regarding the cold and chill that it "was also like none other for a hundred years." Gans wrote that many people and animals died from the cold. He also detailed the great and terrible winds and the heavy snow that they blew between the mountains, and he reported that they "knocked down large and high towers and palaces of the land." This detail, and especially the last comment, was not mentioned in Spangenberg. Why did Gans add this comment? It may have served to instruct his readers that even the wealthy were subject to the whims of the storms. Though Gans may here have been echoing the economy of sin model, the surrounding text that focused on the activities of the Polish king in Bohemia in the late fifteenth century suggests a possible causal con nection between the severe weather and Christian political discord.127 Alternately, the severe weather may simply have been taken by Gans as yet another warning sign of some significant and pending event. For the year 1191, Gans replicated almost the entire entry of Spangenberg. This included devastating weather in the form of hail, thunder, lightening, rain, and wind, which killed many people in the fields and animals, and also devastated the fields, fruit trees, and vineyards. Unlike Spangenberg, Gans mentioned numer ous fires throughout the year. What is most significant is that Gans reversed Span genberg's description. Whereas the latter ended the passage with an eclipse of the sun, Gans began with the eclipse, marking it as something of a portent for the dis asters to come, a situation he noted throughout his chronicle.128 Though Gans clearly read Spangenberg carefully, he recrafted the narratives of severe weather to fit the scope, purposes, and worldview of his chronicle. He left out many descriptions, so the ones he included had particular meaning? geographically, personally, communally, or perhaps even polemically. For Gans, as for his Christian contemporaries, God remained the master of events on earth, especially the weather. For Gans, unusually harsh weather was taken as a punishment for the shortcomings of society. On the other hand, by his use of com parisons and biblical references, in a sense, Gans made the weather patterns part and parcel of a long Jewish and natural history. At the same time, much of the severe weather described by Gans had little to do with Jews, and he infrequently discussed the direct impact of these occurrences on Jews. Representing storms and 127.

Conclusions We have seen that Jewish and Christian relations in early modern Germany could be rather complex and varied widely depending on a range of conditions. Although Jews and Christians often lived separate lives, they also interacted more frequently than once assumed. They engaged each other socially, culturally, economically, and intellectually. They shared certain political events, they experi enced the wonders of nature, and they even attempted to understand the world around them in ways that at times borrowed religious texts and theological con cepts. What do responses to the severe weather that affected Jews and Christians in early modern Germany tell us about how Jews and Christians interacted with each other? Although anti-Jewish motifs surfaced in relation to the effects of extreme weather, Christians did not generally blame Jews for that weather. God produced severe weather. That is not to say that early modern German Christians depicted Jews positively. In much of the literature and visual imagery of the period, Christians presented Jews in a rather sinister light. However, early modern German writers often cast Jews, like the devil, simply as agents who brought a certain form of pun ishment to the Christian world and provided Christians an opportunity to realize their sins and mend their ways. Jews were, in fact, not the only ones to serve in this capacity, as a variety of individuals and groups were presented for criticism. Christians often presented Jews in the middle, caught between the correct and evil courses of action. Christian authors may have castigated biblical Jews for not adhering to the law of God, but it was primarily Christians whom they reprimanded for their behavior. Recourse to the Hebrew Bible reinforced the sense of punishment to be wrought on the ancient Israelites, while simultaneously strengthening the association of contemporary Christians with the chosen people of God. Jews, then, were part of a polemical machine that grafted a wide range of images onto situ ations that pointed out contemporary moral shortcomings and were used as a call to repentance. As such, Jews were a vehicle and not a particular target. Of course, serving as such a vehicle could only inflame traditional stereotypes and accusations, so the images were not harmless even if they could be somewhat ambiguous. Jews also recorded examples of extreme weather, which they, like their Christian neighbors, generally attributed to God as punishment for human sins, as warnings of God's displeasure with human actions, or as an opportunity to redress various social and moral shortcomings. At the same time, Jews, like con temporary Christians, felt the impact of weather conditions on the price of food stuffs and the general economy. Jews clearly saw themselves as part of the world experiencing the significant climatic shifts. As Jews depicted the weather and natural disasters of their age and through out history, they drew from Jewish and non-Jewish sources. They chose what events to (re)narrate and, most importantly, what aspects to include, exclude, 26</page><page sequence="27">The Little Ice Age and the Jews or reorder. By so doing, the accounts Jewish writers utilized could be made to serve larger narratives or to drive home essential social or theological points. Not surprisingly, Jewish authors removed traces of Christianity while presenting general religious motifs. Their critique of contemporary society walked the fine line distinguishing Jewish and general society while opening the possibility of becoming polemical when Christian in-fighting was pointed out or the destruction of Christian possessions was detailed in such contexts. This article is only a small part of a much larger and ongoing project on cul tural responses to natural disaster and excessively difficult weather conditions in early modern Germany. What it reveals so far, however, is that the discussion of weather is a vibrant field of discourse that affords the opportunity to examine Jewish and Christian interactions through a different lens. The nature of anti Judaism and the extent of Jewish engagement with Christians and Christian texts could be complex. The entire theme of early modern Jewish and Christian relations may be well served by the examination of themes and texts that have not traditionally been considered as directly relevant to this topic.
