<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS OF AN EXEGETIC TRADITION IN THE MEKHILTA DE-RABBI ISHMAEL: THE MEANING OF 'AMANAH IN THE SECOND AND THIRD CENTURIES by NORMAN J. COHEN In the past few years, a number of works have appeared which have tried to utilize different methods in the analysis of midrashic and aggadic texts. These recent efforts include the application of literary structural analysis,' formula comparison,2 linguistic tools,3 and form and redaction criticism,4 in 1. See, for example, the work of Jonah Fraenkel. Among his article's which deal with the nature of the talmudic story and the application of structural analysis to it are "Ma'ase be'R. Shila," Tarbi; 40 (1970): 33-40, "She'eilot Hermenutiyot be-Heker Sippur ha-'Aggadah," Tar- bi; 47 (1978): 139-172, and "Ha-Zeman ve-'Isuvo be-Sippurei ha-'Aggadah," in Studies in Aggadah, Targum and Jewish Liturgy in Memory of J. Heinemann, ed. Jakob Petuchowski and Ezra Fleischer (Jerusalem, 1981), pp. 133-162. 2. The most recent work using formula comparison as a means of text analysis and correc- tion is Isaac Boaz Gottlieb's "Formula Comparison in Midrash Research," Jewish Quarterly Review 70 (1979-80): 28-40. 3. For example, Jonah Fraenkel, "Paranomasia in Aggadic Narratives," Scripta Hierosoly- mitana 27 (1978): 27-51. 4. See Joseph Heinemann's work on the literary homily as a uniform, edited whole in his article " 'Omanut ha-Qompozigiyah be-Midrash Va-Yiqra Rabbah," Ha-Sifrut 2 (1971): 808-834 [English pr6cis: "Profile of a Midrash: The Art of Composition in Leviticus Rabbah," 1</page><page sequence="2">2 NORMAN J. COHEN addition to concern for the sitz im leben of particular passages, i.e., socio- historical studies.5 Often, however, it is only through a multifaceted analytic approach that one can begin to plumb the depths of a text. In order to maximize one's understanding of any given passage or compilation, it is necessary to take advantage of a variety of scholarly tools.6 In approaching the text from only one analytic perspective, the student of Midrash will frequently be left with a rather skewed view of its intent and development. We who are interested in the Midrash must begin to hone as many textual skills as possible in order to uncover the mysteries that lie within its passages. With this in mind, I propose to examine a rather well-known passage in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael,7 the famous paean to faith ('amanah) found at the end of Massekhta de-va- Yehi be-Shallab, parashah 7, by focusing upon the exegetic formulae, wordplays, development of theme, literary structure, and historical context. Journal of the American Academy of Religion 39 (1971): 141-150], as well as his analysis of the structure of the petibta in "The Proem in the Aggadic Midrashim: A Form-Critical Study," Scripta Hierosolymitana 22 (1971): 100-122. See also Zipporah Kagan, "Divergent Tendencies and Their Literary Moulding in the Aggadah," Scripta Hierosolymitana 22 (1971): 151-170; Wayne Sibley Towner, The Rabbinic Enumeration of Scriptural Examples (Leiden, 1973); Gary Porton, The Traditions of Rabbi Ishmael, Part Two: Exegetical Comments in Tannaitic Collec- tions (Leiden, 1977); Reuven Hammer, "Section 38 of Sifre Deuteronomy: An Example of the Use of Independent Sources to Create a Literary Unit," Hebrew Union College Annual 50 (1979): 165-178; and Ira Chernus, "On the History of a Pericope in the Midrash Tanbuma," Journal for the Study of Judaism 11 (1980): 53-65. These works attempt to analyze midrashic texts using form and redaction critical tools. Note also the important comments of Richard Sarason in his article "Toward a New Agendum for the Study of Rabbinic Midrashic Litera- ture," in Studies in Aggadah, Targum and Jewish Liturgy in Memory of J. Heinemann, pp. 51-73. 5. For example, Philip R.

Though much of the material in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, like that of the other Exegetic Midrashim, probably emanated from the tannaitic period, scholars generally hold that it was compiled sometime during the first part of the amoraic period. See, in this regard, Leopold Zunz, Ha-Derashot be- Yisra'el, trans. and enl. Hanokh Albeck (Jerusalem, 1947), p. 27; Meir Friedmann, "Mavo," Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Vienna, 1870), pp. xvi-xxvi; and Towner, Rabbinic Enumeration of Scriptural Examples, p. 48, n. 1. For a survey of the scholar- ship on the dating and characteristics of the Mekhilta as well as an example of the minority view which regards it as a very late, post-talmudic compilation, see Ben-Zion Wacholder, "The Date of the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael," Hebrew Union College Annual 39 (1968): 117-144.</page><page sequence="3">ANALYSIS OF AN EXEGETIC TRADITION 3 The Text and Comments The following version of the passage is taken from the critical edition of the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael by Jacob Lauterbach8 and is divided into five sections to facilitate the analysis which will follow.

Then shall Moses and the children of Israel sing" [Exod. 14:31, 15:1]. 8. Jacob Lauterbach, ed. and trans., Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Philadelphia, 1933), vol. 1, pp. 252-255. The text of the Lauterbach edition is superior to that of Hayyim Horowitz and Yisrael Rabin (Jerusalem, 1960), since Horowitz used mainly the early printed editions (Venice, 1545; Constantinople, 1515; and Leghorn, 1801) for his basic text, while Lauterbach utilized both MS Oxford, no. 151 and MS Munich Cod. Hebr. 117 (1) in his text. For a general com- parison of the two editions, see Louis Finkelstein, "The Mekilta and Its Texts," Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research 5 (1933-34): 3-54. In addition, compare Ezra Melamed's review of the Horowitz-Rabin edition in Tarbi; 6 (1934/35): 112-123 with Saul Lieberman's critique of the Lauterbach edition in Qiryat Sefer 12 (1934/35): 54-65. Even though Lieberman would have preferred it if Lauterbach had used one of the full manuscripts and points out the dangers and difficulties of an eclectic text, he repeatedly underscores the gen- erally high quality of the Lauterbach edition. 9. The version in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon b. Yobai reads a bit differently here: ni~av vr~iln m ' n'~,~9 1a  (,3mtIn1) 'u;n . Even though a similar phrase, rnvnl Ir, appears on line 10, it probably was not an original part of the text, since it is not found in any of the other important parallels. These include the early-thirteenth-century Spanish work Sefer ha-Manhig (Hilkhot Pesah 2) and Sefer 'Or Zaru'a (Hilkhot Pesabim 234), which was compiled in the Pro- vence at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Additionally, this phrase is not part of the repetition of the opening derash at the end of the passage (1. 43), even in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon version (MRSBY). 10. The Horowitz-Rabin edition, following the earlier printed editions, has the formula "-ni introducing the second text from Exodus 15:1. 11. At this point, the printed editions and, therefore, the Horowitz-Rabin text contain the following sentence: ,'n-' I~'Knur n K r1~ K n t f, y1 Pm nf, Pi, 1,'yn N m h1Ky N V' NtV rfrn l p1nri .isp- 15 -.1nan 'a rn nnT . w.

Nehemiah says: Whence can you prove that whosoever accepts one single commandment with 'amanah is deserving of having the holy spirit rest upon him? We find this to have been the case with our forebears. For as a reward for their 'amanah, they merited having the holy spirit rest upon them, and as a result they gave forth in song, as it is said: "And they had faith in the Lord.... Then shall Moses and the children of Israel sing." And so is the case of our father Abraham, who inherited both this world and the world-to- come only as a reward for his 'amanah, as it is said: "And he had faith in the Lord" [Gen. 15:6]. And titled Middot Soferim, argued that the order of the material in the printed edition was preferred and that the tradition regarding Abraham was correctly placed prior to the comment of R. Nehemiah (p. 406), this is surely not the case. Not only do the manuscripts and all the later parallels, such as Yalqut Shim'oni 1:240, confirm that this derash should appear only once in this passage and following the R. Nehemiah material, but from a structural point of view it can only appear there. (See my comments below, p. 12). The erroneous repetition of the material at this point in the passage is probably the result of a scribal error of the type called homoeoteleu- ton, by which the copyist simply moved his eye from line 5 to line 12 and copied the subsequent material. 12. The printed editions as well as Sefer ha-Manhig and Sefer 'Or Zaru'a do not have the opening as ... v ~VimK nxl Tp~ but begin simply with the word ?D. This reading, which presents the comment attributed to R. Nehemiah as a statement of principle rather than a request for a biblical proof text, is probably the original, since the formulae 'xr,- p7 and xi nnnrn p', which follow, come to supply illustrations or applications of a previously stated point. See additional comments about the function of the formula xti nnr K p on pp. I 1-12. 13. The MRSBY reads n;wvir, v, while the version in 'Or Zaru'a substitues up?91n for 14. The unit of material on lines 9-12 (wr~, -.a3w... ,~' pv) is not found in either 'Or Zaru'a or the Manhig. 15. The printed editions supply the end of this crucial proof text: npsYT n' wn', "And He counted it to him for righteousness." 16.

"Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation that keeps faithfulness may enter in" [Isa. 26:2]. In this gate, then, all people of 'amanah shall enter. And thus it says: "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto Your name, O most high; to declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, and Your 'emunah in the night seasons" [Ps. 92:2-3], 17.

It is in this sense that it is said: "To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning because of the 'emunah in You in the night seasons" [ibid., v. 3]. And so also Jehoshaphat says to the people: "Have faith in the Lord, your God, so shall you be established; have faith in His prophets, so shall you prosper" [2 Chron. 20:20]. And it is written: "O Lord, are not Your eyes directed to 'emunah" [Jer. 5:3]. And it is written: "But the righteous shall live by his 'emunah" [Hab. 2:4].

For as a reward for their "amanah, the holy spirit rested upon them and they gave forth in song, as it is said: "And they had faith in the Lord and in His servant Moses ... Then shall Moses and the children of Israel sing this song unto the Lord" [Exod. 14:31, 15:1]. And so also it says: "Since they have faith in His words, they will sing His praises" [Ps. 106:12]. The passage rests upon the proximity of the last verse of Exodus 14 ('my r=v 'nr I~~nm1) and the first verse in chapter 15 ('31 nv n irv, t ... .*iv'). Based upon the rabbis' belief that contiguity means causality,25 it is stressed at the outset that Israel merited singing their song of redemption because they had faith (irmni) in God.26 Redemption came as a result of the people's 'amanah, however it is to be defined. The root Inx in the Bible, though most often translated as "believe," clearly connotes a more comprehensive attitude and relationship, and is bet- ter understood as meaning "trust" or "confidence."27 In the context of a covenantal relationship, the Israelite trusted that God would protect him and ensure his prosperity if he observed the commandments. Having faith in 24. This reading is an error on Lauterbach's part, since the manuscripts as well as the key parallel versions, such as Yalqut Shim'oni 1:240 and Yalqut Hosea 519, all read r13m. 25. Isaac Heinemann, Darkhei ha-'Aggadah (Jerusalem, 1954), bk. 2, pp. 135-136, 140-143. 26. In this light, the reading in the Lauterbach edition, which does not have the term "I~m prior to the Exodus 15:1 citation in lines 5, 12, and 45, seems to be preferred. 27. For a definition of Inx in the Bible, see inter alia Rudolf Bultmann and Arthur Weiser, s.v. "Faith," Kittel's Dictionary of the New Testament (London, 1961), p. 10; Israel Abraham, s.v. "Belief," Encyclopaedia Judaica 4:929-934; Max Kadushin, The Rabbinic Mind (New York, 1952), p. 42; Claude Montefiore and Herbert Loewe, A Rabbinic Anthology (Philadel- phia, 1960), p. 336; and Dan Dorfman, "Some Aspects of Faith in Rabbinic Literature" (rab- binic thesis, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, 1976), pp. 16-18. It should be noted that God is not the exclusive object of Inx. It is also used in the Bible to describe the relationship among people. See, for example, 2 Chronicles 20:20.</page><page sequence="8">8 NORMAN J. COHEN God almost invariably meant being obedient to His laws and instructions.28 Similarly, the concept of 'emunah in rabbinic literature also represents a sense of comprehensive trust in God. Even though trusting in God and obeying His mitzvot are not necessarily synonymous,29 it is clear that for the rabbis observance was a major expression of Israel's faith in and reliance upon God. The rabbis could never merely have understood 'emunah as trust in a general, abstract sense, but rather emphasized that it ultimately had to be expressed in faithfulness to God's commandments.30 The notion that belief or trust in God means the observance of the mitz- vot is underscored in our passage by the consistent use of the term mxm instead of rnmox. The same term is found in the Bible in Nehemiah 10:1, where it connotes entering into a covenant to keep the commandments: "We make a sure covenant (mr i' qam1) and subscribe it." In a similar manner, whenever 'amanah appears in rabbinic texts it involves the fulfilling of obli- gations and acting in good faith. Whether it be in halakhic passages, in which the phrase m " or is frequently found,31 or in 'Aggadah, where terms like mlim iv32 and mnX V,33 are used, the word 'amanah signifies the expectation of action in the context of relationship. Here, in our Mekhilta tradition, the words ,n niv (11. 9, 17, and 43) seem to mean reward not merely for faith but, rather, for the faithful observance of God's command- ments, since they follow upon R. Nehemiah's comment at the outset of Section II (... mr anx m rI ,Y.v pn ' ). In addition, the phrase 1it ?ip mnnx ... has a clear legal tone which underscores the willingness on the person's part to take upon himself a specific obligation. 28. Isaac Heinemann, s.v. " 'Emunah," Encyclopedia Miqr'ayit 1:426-428, and Bultmann and Weiser, "Faith," p. 44. Many biblical passages illustrate that in the Bible faith is nearly synonymous with obedience. See, for example, 2 Chronicles 19:9. Similarly, when Israel lacks faith or trust (i~'n i x), the Bible emphasizes its failure to observe God's commandments. In this regard, see Deuteronomy 9:23 and Psalm 78. 29. Note Dorfman's critique of scholars like Bultmann who assert that in rabbinic litera- ture faith is identical with obedience to the law. In his thesis, "Some Aspects of Faith in Rab- binic Literature," pp. 98-99, 168-169, Dorfman stresses that only a smattering of 'aggadot directly associate jTx with the performance of the mitzvot. 30. Even Dorfman (p. 77) admits that Israel demonstrates its "faith" in God mainly by its faithfulness to its part of the covenant, i.e., by observing God's commandments. See, in addi- tion, the comments by Louis Jacobs, Faith (London, 1968), p. 101. 31. For example, note B.T. Ketubot 19b. 32. Bereshit Rabbah 100:9. 33. B.T. Sotah 48b.</page><page sequence="9">ANALYSIS OF AN EXEGETIC TRADITION 9 Structure and Theme It is sometimes quite difficult to dissect passages found in the Exegetic Midrashim into their basic blocks of expositional material, since our extant compilations have undergone stages of redaction. Frequently, later redac- tors glossed earlier traditions in an effort to achieve greater clarity. They often provided the reader with additional examples of major principles as well as supplementary biblical proof texts.34 On occasion, they even added chunks of material as a means of balancing or even mitigating certain points of view.35 In addition, the Exegetic Midrashim suffered further accretions by copyists adding marginal annotations and other material.36 Yet, if we focus upon the different exegetic formulae and thematic phrases which recur in different parts of a given passage, we can begin to delineate the basic units of tradition which were edited together and thereby improve our understanding of the purpose of the material. Note the follow- ing presentation of our tradition from the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael in this regard: A v'pn min ,r tm'y nimv "f'ill 5 i .... :11 ron, , 34. K.G. Eckart, Untersuchungen zur Traditionsgeschichte der Mechilta (Berlin, 1959), p. 54. Ezra Melamed, in his Pirkei Mavo le-Sifrut ha-Talmud (Jerusalem, 1973), p. 187, stresses that through the process of redaction, strophelike structures were created around major prin- ciples or themes, while Towner, Rabbinic Enumeration of Scriptural Examples, p. 154, has demonstrated that the stichwort at times functioned as a rather artificial criterion for adding biblical texts to a rabbinic enumeration pattern. 35. Note, as an illustration, the opening section in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Mas- sekhta de-Pisha, parashah 1, in which Moses is pictured at first as being superior to Aaron, since he received revelation while his brother did not. However, subsequently, through clear redactional additions, the two are declared to be equally important. 36.

They merely repeat previously cited material and phrases, and probably were added in order to link this unit of material to the pericope text. That these lines did not originally belong to Unit B is substantiated by the fact that they are missing in the versions in Sefer 'Or Zaru'a and Sefer ha-Manhig. Both of these thirteenth-century compilations are reliable text witnesses, since their compilers were very exacting in transmitting the material they quoted from earlier sources.39 In both of these works, following R. Nehemiah's statement of principle, there are three case illustrations: two are found in Section II (xV n xv and arnt m' ,t), while the third constitutes Section IV (nmi7n 'KW).

This formula almost always follows a derash or more frequently a statement of principle based upon a biblical text and serves to introduce an application or illustration.40 In addition, the three cases bear the very same formula, phraseology, and structure,41 and are ordered chronologically - Abraham's reward, redemption from Egypt, and the final return of the exiles. All this indicates that these three cases originally formed one unit of material together with the statement of principle attributed to R. Nehemiah, which they illustrate. Unit C is the third uniform block of material utilized in our Mekhilta passage. Its uniformity is underscored by the use of one recurrent introduc- tory formula, txi K1~p1, which, in contrast to ~n rinx 1pi, merely lists addi- tional biblical examples.42 This unit is a collection of verses which use the 39. Note, in this regard, the comments of Yi$1ak Raphael in the introduction to his recent- ly published edition of Sefer ha-Manhig le-Rabbi Avraham be-Rabbi Natan ha-Yarbi (Jeru- salem: Mosad ha-Ray Kook, 1978), pp. 22-24. 40. In the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael there are eighteen passages in which the formula pDI xin ann appears. In no fewer than sixteen of these, it comes to introduce a case which illustrates a previously stated principle or interpretation of the text. Only in Shirta, parashah 2 (Lauter- bach ed. 11, p. 20) and 'Amaleq, parashah 2 (11, p. 159) does this pattern partially break down. It should be added that in many texts the formula Nin nnx p is repeated a number of times, each time introducing another illustration or application, as is the case in our passage. 41. The only possible breakdown seems to come in the last paragraph (Sec. IV), where the reading in the Lauterbach edition and in the printed editions is invv a nnxn I ='o D x (1. 38) instead of the fuller ,mr n inw z' m Kn m x, as is the case in the first two illustrations. Yet both the Oxford and Munich MSS as well as the Sefer ha-Manhig all have the added word 3nuin. Moreover, unlike the first two cases, the last section has a second proof text appended (from Hos. 2:21 f.). However, this verse is associated creatively with the text from Song of Songs 4:8 by a subtle sound play on the roots wrK1 (nmx w mni ,'n) and wi' (nminn 5 'nr '* I). 42.

Actually Section III is made up of two distinct subunits which are intro- duced by iniar n pi and which begin and end with a repetition of key thematic phrases. The first starts with the words nxri oanmn and ends with ain anwv, while the second is built both upon the consonantal play be- tween Ton (Tron p%1732 3Tn) at the outset and rvrTn (wp= ,~'vrn) at the close, as well as on the repetition of the word np=. One additional text from Psalm 106:12 which uses the root ~nK is introduced by the formula nax in ~p and is appended to the final section of our passage. It is highly probable that this text originally belonged to Unit C but was separated over time and placed at the close for thematic reasons. We have some reason to believe this is so since the parallel version in Yalqut Hosea 519 presents our material without the summary paragraph (Section V) and with the Psalm 106:12 text attached to the main portion of Unit C. All of Unit C is missing from the version preserved in Sefer ha-Manhig and Sefer 'Or Zaru'a, which gives added proof that the original core unit of our passage consisted only of the comment attributed to R. Nehemiah with its three case illustrations. It seems that Unit C was interjected at some point in order to extend the material on amanah. Our passage, therefore, is made up of three distinct units of traditional material which have been sewn together by editors and/or redactors. Even though Unit B (Sections II and IV) is the core of the material and establishes its essential thrust, the manner in which the other units were edited in enhances the development of the theme and helps draw the material to a fit- ting climax. Section I stresses that as a reward for their 'amanah Israel sang their song of redemption at the Red Sea. Though at this point the symbolic significance of "singing" is not clear, it is hinted at by the play on the roots rni (vnnw ,ypni min ,7 r) and nv,, which indicates that "singing" involves a kind of prophetic insight. Additionally, implied in the future-tense form of the verb in Exodus 15:1 (,vq,) is the notion that Israel would sing a song of ultimate redemption. This, too, will be the result of 'amanah. However, the reader Rabbi Ishmael, thirty-five cases only involve the supplying of additional examples for a pre- viously mentioned point. In the other ten instances a derash is appended to the biblical citation which usually explains its connection to the main point. On occasion, we find a series of biblical texts cited, each introduced by the formula nmi xnn pi.</page><page sequence="14">14 NORMAN J. COHEN does not yet know exactly how to define 'amanah; he doesn't fully under- stand what it is that effects redemption. In Section II, which is the first part of Unit B, the rabbis' concept of amanah is clearly defined. The tradition attributed to R. Nehemiah and its three case illustrations demonstrate that, at least for our biblical forebears, it was the faithful observance of the mitzvot that results not only in prophetic insight but, more importantly, in the attainment of blessing and redemp- tion.43 R. Nehemiah stresses that it is not those who merely have 'amanah but those who fulfill one mitzvah with 'amanah who are rewarded. At this point, with the utilization of the formula Kxr ,rnx pi, Abraham is brought as the first case illustration of R. Nehemiah's principle. Abraham is pictured as gaining the world-to-come due to his 'amanah. We might be tempted to understand this comment and the appended proof text from Genesis 15:6 quite literally as implying that Abraham merely had faith in God and was rewarded, since this seems to have been an early exege- tic tradition of the Genesis 15:6 passage. The best example of this is found in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Massekhta de-va- Yehi be-Shallah, parashah 4 (to Exod. 14:15), where we read the following tradition attributed to the famous early teacher Shemaiah: "....'In' tm" :-.I? ,P,, nw 9r, ,-p r'a r, :3 ,T'nN9 l Vl :3 . ,'1 r9 Yet, it is important to note that this material is set into a passage which emphasizes Abraham's observance of one commandment.

Though Eckart's words of caution about the unreliability of the ascription of individual passages to particular tradents in the Mekhilta are important (see his Untersuchungen, pp. 110-114), it is interesting to note that the observance of the commandments is viewed as effec- tuating redemption in several traditions attributed to R. Nehemiah, a third-generation Pales- tinian tanna. See, for example, Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 2:19 and Midrash Tehilim 12:5.</page><page sequence="15">ANALYSIS OF AN EXEGETIC TRADITION 15 A similar juxtaposition between the observance of the commandment of cir- cumcision and the redemptive experience occurs in Massekhta de-Pisha, parashah 16 (to Exod. 13:4): 13 '?41 .(-w= :nljp wp'flf) "p=?t 1?33 Kvzywr" :1?31K1 "MY 011113M nx W1KflK 1 1j 31 T JK 1K 15I.v ,1D3yxl" :-1?ZK3W aP, rl y?= "I1:rw, nx 01p Tn l :'I;I w n n nI D13 : I"Zl "MI- .(1:1i u 5j7ynI-) ",'lmv "in 1'?3mL 7j ; ?1 ,1'?3rzr3 n1 rZ Therefore, even if early traditions did imply that Abraham's righteousness was expressed through his faith alone, it seems that a bit later on the rabbis went out of their way to emphasize that his faith was expressed through action, be it his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac or, by implication, his fulfillment of the commandment of circumcision.44 It is in this light that Abraham is brought as the first illustration of R. Nehemiah's principle - he is rewarded because of his faithful action, i.e., his 'amanah. Similarly, at the end of Section II, the Israelites' redemption from Egypt must be seen as being due to their observance of the mitzvot, since this is the second case illustration of R. Nehemiah's principle regarding 'amanah. The derash here is most creative and forceful. Attached to the statement that Israel were redeemed from Egypt as a reward for their faith (noKt "w: 13bK'rn) is a proof text from Exodus 4:31: 'xn, ,:n n 'rn "o , I i~n'i Dn n KJu'1 - "And the people had faith; and when they heard that God had remem- bered the children of Israel ... " (1. 18). Though on a peshat level the verb "ip is understood as "remember," it can also mean "command." Therefore, the verse is interpreted as saying that Israel showed their faith in God when they had internalized (iy,), i.e., accepted, His commandment(s). It was because of this that God redeemed them from Egypt. It should be noted in this regard that there are several passages in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael which underscore the notion that redemption from Egypt came as a result of the fulfillment of one particular commandment by the Israelites, that being circumcision.45 At this point, prior to the final portion of Unit B, which involves the application of R. Nehemiah's statement to the ingathering of the exiles in 44. The rabbis sometimes portray Abraham as having fulfilled all the laws of the Torah prior to Sinai. See, for example, M. Kiddushin 4:14, B.T. Yoma 28b, 'Aggadat Bereshit, chap. 56, and Midrash Mishlei 16:31. Nevertheless, here the emphasis has to be on Abraham's obser- vance of one specific commandment, based upon R. Nehemiah's comment. 45. The best example is found in Massekhta de-Pisha, parashah 5 (to Exod. 12:6).</page><page sequence="16">16 NORMAN J. COHEN the future, Section III is appropriately interjected. Having presented Abra- ham and the Israelites redeemed from Egypt as illustrations of those whose 'amanah - faithful observance of the commandments out of their sense of covenant - brought them reward and redemption, our passage now turns to a listing of biblical texts which merely involve different forms of the word InK. Yet, some of these verses may have been understood by the rabbis as also stressing that righteous action and obedience to the law lead to God's pro- tection and to ultimate redemption. Note in this regard the symbolism pres- ent in the text from Psalm 92:2-3. It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord ... to declare Your lovingkind- ness in the morning (T~on 1~i= ,an*) and Your 'emunah in the night seasons (nm~,3 lnnnxi). For You, Lord, have made me glad (,nnnwv) through Your work (15YD'); I will sing of the works of Your hands (,'v' 'wuym). The simple meaning of the text is that God's own faithfulness to the cove- nant is measured by His willingness to act. It is the work of His hands, too, which leads to redemption.46 However, because of the vacillation in the text between the second and third persons - nfZ'5 'jInnlm-- '". 5nrn - the rabbis may have interpreted it to mean that God rejoiced in the faith- ful acts of humankind (,lpr' ,?n ~7DI ,nnlnxK) in this world. As a result, we will be rewarded with the world-to-come. The full text in the printed edi- tions and the Munich MS makes the derash explicit by adding the words "1 n *= n mI ? ' r 'p'~I to line 30. At this point, the theme of our passage may have taken on the futuristic aspect alluded to at the outset, which is best symbolized by the recurrent 46. A number of passages in rabbinic literature emphasize that God Himself is considered faithful, i.e., an mn~a 5 , when He acts in this world. Note in this regard Sifrei Devarim 307: Kx ai'n5i oy:w ,twunI nnx t - "God showed His faith when He created the world." See also Dorfman's comment, in "Some Aspects of Faith," p. 57, that God is considered faithful primarily when He fulfills His promises of reward (and punishment) to humankind.</page><page sequence="17">ANALYSIS OF AN EXEGETIC TRADITION 17 usage of the terms "7// /" . The derash on Psalm 92:2-5 is the first and most important example of this, since it can be read as stressing that because of our faithful observance of the mitzvot in this world, symbolized by "night" (nmbk ImnnK), we will be rewarded with life in the world-to-come (0i~ n v",l 1r7on). The play upon i~/,n' is made more explicit in the fuller version pre- served in the printed editions and in the Munich MS, as is the identification of the second-person endings (e.g., innu) with humankind: A similar use of -11n as a symbol of the world-to-come and as a way of stressing that future redemption depends upon our 'amanah is seen in the passage from Lamentations 3:22-23 which is cited at the end of Section III. By ending the section with this quotation rather than with the last biblical verse, which is part of the overall unit (C), Psalm 106:12, the editor ensured a smooth transition to Section IV, which deals with the return of the exiles to Eretz Yisrael. The full text reads: Surely the Lord's mercy is never consumed; surely His compassion never fails. They are renewed every morning; great is your 'emunah. Again, the change of address from third person to second person may allow the rabbis to interpret the verse conditionally, stressing that God's mercy and compassion are renewed in the morning, i.e., in the world-to-come, if your (humankind's) 'emunah is great. Section IV, which is also introduced by the formula ti rrnxn ~i, is the last of the block of case illustrations of the view attributed to R. Nehemiah that 'amanah involves the observance of the commandments. It is appro- priately placed toward the end of the passage, since it moves the theme to a logical climax. It does not speak of redemption in a universal sense but spe- cifies that the faithful observance of the mitzvot will bring an end to the persecution of the Jewish people and their return to their homeland, upon which they will dwell in perpetuity, forever covenanted with their God. It seems that the text from Hosea 2:21-22 is taken by the rabbis as emphasizing that God will solidify His relationship with Israel because of their faith (nm -1 ' 1mrixK1). Yet, the second element in this tripartite betrothal statement (tuz~l pr= '4 1 I-nmY1K1) serves to define the nature of that faith: God says He will betroth Israel due to their just, righteous, and compassionate acts.</page><page sequence="18">18 NORMAN J. COHEN At the conclusion of our passage in Section V, Psalm 106:12, which is appended to the repetition of Unit A, makes very explicit the notion that those who faithfully observe God's commandments (0'r~rn i'rni) will surely sing His praise in the future (irn9imn i ,l).47 The juxtaposing of this verse, which is taken from Unit C, with the opening verses from Exodus 14:31/15:1 (',, t ... .3.,i1) brings the passage full circle and clearly defines the rabbinic idea of 'amanah. The theme that faith through obedience to God's law effects redemption is highlighted by a beautiful play on the roots ,viivn-/'/ivn which runs through our Mekhilta passage and indicates the extent to which our passage is the product of an editor. At the outset, the text stresses that as a result of their trust in God, the holy spirit rested (onm.v) upon the people of Israel and they sang (vw,) a song of redemption. Yet, as we have said, the act of singing also seems to symbolize a kind of prophetic glimpse into the future. If there is any doubt that the passage is speaking of a messianic song, note the same emphasis in the quotation from Isaiah 26 in Section III (1. 22). There, the entire text reads: "On that day shall this song be sung (tP1vrn Vw) in the Land of Judah: we have a strong city; walls and bulwarks does He appoint for sal- vation (nvIv'). Open ye the gates that the righteous nation that keeps faith- fulness (mnn x viv) may enter in." In a similar yet even more creative and poignant manner, Song of Songs 4:8 is cited in Section IV in the context of a stress upon the future ingathering of the exiles. The peshat of this biblical text is clear: Israel shall gaze [upon the Land of Israel] from the top of [Mount] Amana -- vm~n 'i'v ln. However, the derash turns on the play of 'nin-invn and emphasizes that Israel will glimpse into the messianic future and sing its song of redemption because of the extent of its 'amanah (,;Win ,N~o).48 Finally, the last text quoted, from Psalm 106:12, stresses the relationship between 'amanah, as expressed through the observance of the commandments, and the singing of a future song of praise to God: i~3~~' i1n'r n-vY' ,rnrmr1. 47. Not only does the beginning of Psalm 106 (v. 12) succinctly define 'emunah in terms of the fulfillment of God's commands, but it also emphasizes the importance of acting justly and righteously (v. 3), and, as well, describes God redeeming His people from Egypt and saving them at the Sea (vv. 7-11). 48. A parallel in Shemot Rabbah 23:5 spells out even more explicitly the play on ,'in/n'vn, and the stress on the song being a messianic projection: ".IV ntlKm a( e)t' 'up o "n v -15nt " :'-1p .t.. fil 1 t  l 'n -- "rflenK to ?

Assuming that the core of our tradition, like most of the Mekhilta material, emanated from the latter part of the tannaitic period, and that the work itself was compiled in the early part of the amoraic period,50 we must analyze what possible factors, in the context of second- to third-century Palestine, would force the rabbis to stress that only faithful obedience to the law would lead to ultimate redemption. Aside from the prohibition against ritual observance during the Hadrianic persecutions, to which the rabbis responded by underscoring the importance of continued fulfillment of the commandments,5 the two major challenges to the Jewish community during that time came from a burgeoning Christianity and a rampant Gnosticism. It should be noted that a number of scholars have recently argued that there is a lack of evidence for the impact of Pauline Christianity and its theo- logical views upon rabbinic Judaism in the tannaitic and early amoraic was the first person in the Bible about whom it was said that he "trusted in God" (Genesis 15:6 - ,n1 p,,1n) and from whom Israel inherited its notion of 'emunah. Additionally, the word nivn also means "reward" or "gift" (see 1 Sam. 9:7), and this gives further support to the derash that Israel was to be rewarded ('rnuin), i.e., redeemed, due to its 'amanah. See Song of Songs Rabbah 4:8:2 in this regard. 49. Since the time of Leopold Zunz (Ha-Derashot, p. 27), scholars have viewed the Exegetic Midrashim as collections of independent expositions arranged according to the order of scrip- tural verses. They thought that these texts simply strung together traditions drawn from a variety of disparate sources without attempting to shape them into homogeneous structures. See, in this regard, Hanokh Albeck, Mavo u-Maftebot le-Midrash Bereshit Rabbah (Jerusalem, 1965), pt. I, p. 1; Jacob N. Epstein, Mevo'ot le-Sifrut ha- Tannaim (Jerusalem, 1957), pt. III, p. 572; and Joseph Heinemann (with Jakob Petuchowski), Literature of the Synagogue (New York, 1975), p. 135. However, our analysis has shown that at least certain sections of these compilations reflect some degree of editing and the development of unified themes. For a similar view, note the work of Jakob Petuchowski, "A Sermon on Psalm 29 Attributed to Rabbi Ele'azar Hamoda'i," Hebrew Union College Annual 48 (1977): 243-264, and Hammer, "Section 38 of Sifre Deuteronomy," pp. 165-178. In addition, note the comments of scholars like Joseph Heinemann, who, in his works Literature of the Synagogue, pt. III, pp. 119 and 135, and Derashot ba-Zibbur be-Tequfat ha- Talmud (Jerusalem, 1971), p. 17, underscores the few examples of the proem (petibta) pattern of public sermon preserved in the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael and in Sifrei Devarim. 50. See n. 7 above. 51. See, for example, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Massekhta de-Babodesh, parashah 6 (to Exod. 20:6).</page><page sequence="20">20 NORMAN J. COHEN periods. They believe that if the rabbis were concerned about Christianity, it was solely about Jewish Christians who remained partially within the fold.52 However, even some of the exponents of this view admit that by the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt, with the final separation between Jews and Chris- tians and the growing Gentile nature of the church in Palestine, the rabbis were forced to react with ever increasing vigor to Christian theological views and biblical interpretations." To be sure, the early rabbinic response to Christianity was almost entirely internally directed. The rabbis attempted to buttress their fellow Jews, who were beset both by members of the Jewish community who were Christian and by Christian theological arguments cur- rent in the second to third century.54 As the nascent church became more and more Gentile and threatened to make inroads into the Jewish com- munity, rabbinic leaders had to provide polemical replies to the theological challenges they faced. One of the greatest challenges came from the Pauline notion of justification by faith and the rejection of Jewish ritual practice. 52. For example, Reuven Kimelman, "Birkat ha-Minim and the Lack of Evidence for an Anti-Christian Jewish Prayer in Late Antiquity," in Jewish and Christian Self-Definition, vol. 2, Aspects of Judaism in the Graeco-Roman Period, ed. E. B.

It should be noted that a clear description of the Jewish-Christian groups in Palestine is difficult, since their history is scantily documented, and the church fathers from whom we receive information do not have a very clear notion of their doctrinal positions. See the different portraits of Jewish- Christian groups by such scholars as Gedaliah Alon, The Jews in Their Land in the Talmudic Age, trans. from the Hebrew by Gershon Levi (Jerusalem, 1980), vol. 1, pp. 294-302; F.

Though this is debated by a few eminent scholars," it is clear that Paul, especially in his Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians, emphasized that salvation comes to the individual through his faith rather than through obedience to the law.56 For Paul, Mosaic law was no longer valid. Its purpose was temporary: to underscore the sins of humankind, thus making them liable to punish- ment and death.7 Having consigned all persons to sin, the law brought about the need for Jesus and his redemptive work. Therefore, it was abso- lutely impossible for anyone to be justified before God through the law. Even those who argue that Paul did not view Mosaic law in such negative terms, citing Paul's stress on the fact that obedience to the law is good (Rom. 2:13), admit that its validity as a means of attaining salvation ceased when Jesus rose from the dead.58 Salvation can only come "if you confess with your lips that God raised him from the dead" (Rom. 10:9). Faith, then, for Paul is the acceptance of the gospel concerning the death and resurrec- tion of Jesus, and the salvific significance of these events. Salvation is the product of &amp;Ko4 TrirfTop (Gal. 3:2, 5), which should not be translated as 55. Among others, see Albert Schweitzer, The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (London, 1956), pp. 220-226; Krister Stendahl, "The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West," Harvard Theological Review 56 (1963): 199-215; and W. D. Davies, Paul and Rab- binic Judaism (New York, 1965), pp. xiii and 221-222. Davies argues that justification by faith was merely a metaphor used by Paul due to polemical necessity. In his Epistles to the Galatians and to the Romans, Paul consciously presents his claims over against those of Judaism, and the emphasis upon faith vs. works was a convenient polemic for him. In regard to Davies's claims, it is interesting to note that out of a total of 109 instances of the use of the term 7rtcatg ("faith") in Paul's Epistles, 62 of them occur in Galatians and Romans. 56. See Rom. 3:20-31, 4:2-16, 9:30-33, 10:4-12 and Gal. 2:16-21, 3:6-25 among many. Though Paul's rejection of the law might be understood as applying only to ritual, it should be noted that for him the essential contrast is between lrirUTL ("faith") and fpba ("work"). In fact, for Paul, justification through faith implies that no independent human activity of any kind, even ethical behavior, is necessary. Yet Paul speaks of both v6pov ToO XpLO pTo - "the law of Christ" (Gal. 6:2) and v6dov p ri'aTg - "a law of faith" (Rom. 3:27), which seems to show that he does not inculcate total ethical indifference, as Hans-Joachim Schoeps points out in his Paul: The Theology of the Apostle in the Light of Jewish Religious History (London, 1961), p. 210. Faith completely revolutionizes the believer and produces within him a new kind of life. The stamp of Christ will be upon the whole of the Christian's daily activity; the life of the believer is one of moral renewal. See, in this regard, Rom. 12:2, 2 Cor. 3:18, 4:16, and Eph. 4:23-25, as well as the comments of William Henry Paine Hatch, The Pauline Idea of Faith (in Its Relation to Jewish and Hellenistic Religion) (London, 1917), pp. 39, 47, and 53. 57. See Terrence Gallan's astute comments on Galatians 3, in this regard, in his article, "Pauline Midrash: The Exegetical Background of Galatians 3:19b," Journal of Biblical Litera- ture 99 (1980): 549-567. 58. For example, Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, p. 550, and Schoeps, Paul, p. 171.</page><page sequence="22">22 NORMAN J. COHEN "the hearing of faith," but rather as "believing what was heard," i.e., the Gospel.59 One of the key foundations of Paul's theme of justification through faith is the biblical patriarch Abraham. Both Galatians 3 and Romans 4 imply that Abraham was the prototype of Christian faith, since Genesis 15:6 emphasizes that blessing came to him not through obedience to the law but rather through the righteousness of faith.60 Abraham was "justified" even before he was commanded to undergo circumision, merely because "he believed in God and it was accounted to him for righteousness." Abraham was viewed as the father of all who believe, whether circumcised or not, since blessing came to him through his faith in God's power of resurrec- tion.6' The main thrust of Paul's argument is that salvation is attained apart from the law and as a pure gift of grace, and Abraham is its primary model. With Paul's emphasis upon justification by faith and his rejection of the law, especially ritual observance,62 a clear contrast was established between Judaism and Christianity. According to Paul, Christianity was not the law and Jesus, but Jesus alone. Paul's view of faith as man's response to salva- tion offered in Jesus was an argument against the Jewish view that the obser- vance of the mitzvot is the means of attaining redemption. Paul's totally negative attitude toward Mosaic law, and his view that neither ritual nor ethical behavior was necessary for the attainment of salva- tion, was not shared totally by the apostolic fathers. Starting with Clement of Rome's Epistle to the Corinthians,63 which emphasizes that Abraham proved himself through his actions,64 and lists the many ways a person must act justly,65 the early church fathers modified Paul's teachings. The most important change was their overriding concern for the require- 59. Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, pp. 482-483. Like other New Testament scholars, Sanders emphasizes that for Paul salvation comes through faith and not through the law for two reasons: (1) if salvation came as a result of the observance of Mosaic law, it would exclude the Gentiles and nullify Jesus' appointment as savior of all who believe; and (2) if it is sufficient to keep the law in order to inherit the promise of salvation, Jesus died in vain (p. 490). 60.

Such church figures as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus of Rome, Clement of Alexandria, and even Origen all seem to believe that ethical action and moral integrity are an essential part of the content of faith. Jesus' death and resurrection did not lead to a total suspension of Mosaic law but only of its rabbinic elaborations.66 Even though second-century theologians emphasized the importance of ethical behavior, they did accept Paul's notion of faith insomuch as it implied a rejection of Jewish ritual observance. For example, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian echo Paul in their characterization of cultic law as a yoke intended solely for the Jews which was made obsolete by Jesus,67 and in their understanding of circumcision in purely symbolic terms.68 In addi- tion, both Justin and Irenaeus stress that Abraham was the forerunner of Christian faith because he received God's blessing while he was yet un- circumcised and before the Sinaitic covenant.69 While the works of these church fathers reflect the fact that Paul's rejec- tion of Mosaic law was only partially accepted by the mainstream of the second-century church, another position developed which was more closely akin to Paul's theology. Stemming perhaps from the Gospel of John,70 this point of view had as its springboard the Letter of Barnabas. Besides rejecting Jewish ritual practice, particularly circumcision,7' and seeing Abraham as the model of justification through faith, based upon Genesis 15:6,72 the Let- ter of Barnabas contains a totally deprecatory attitude toward all of Mosaic law. Based upon Paul's famous comment in Galatians 3:19,73 the author Judeo-Christians, understood Genesis 15:6 to mean that Abraham was justified by his works and not by faith alone when he willingly offered his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice (2:21-24). 65.

COHEN undercuts the validity of the law when he claims that it was the product of "an evil angel who was teaching them [vain] cleverness."74 A similar attitude is seen in the first part of the Epistle to Diognetus and the Apology to A ristides. 75 Paul's rejection of the law was taken to an extreme by many of the early Gnostic groups. Basilideans, Carpocratians, Valentinians, and Marcionites, among others, believed that the material world was the product of a demiurge, a lesser angelic force, and was intrinsically evil. In addition, any- thing that affirmed man's participation in the system of creation was but a means by which the creator shackled man's soul and prevented it from join- ing the Source of Goodness, which was outside of the cosmos. Therefore, all spiritual beings who have gained true knowledge (gnosis) of God must cease observing the law, since to do so would be to affirm a belonging to the world, which should be reduced to a minimum.76 In this light, Mosaic law was viewed as the vehicle for the persecution and enslavement of human- kind, and therefore must be rejected. Even moral goodness, which by this- worldly standards might be preferable to licentiousness, is totally irrelevant from the point of view of transcendent salvation.77 The radical Gnostics created a total antinomianism which perhaps took Pauline inferences far beyond the position of Paul himself. It is against the backdrop of Christianity's rejection of the law as the means of attaining salvation and its emphasis upon the faith of the pious believer in the death and resurrection of Jesus, as well as the antinomianism of its Gnostic counterparts, that our Mekhilta passage must be read. When Gentile Christians and Gnostics were claiming that salvation would come as a result of either faith or mystical knowledge, the rabbis of the second and third century had to go out of their way to emphasize that for the Jew redemption would be the reward for observance of the commandments. Additionally, it is not surprising that the core tradition ascribed to R. Nehemiah singled out Abraham as an example of one who, through the per- formance of even a single act, was rewarded with life in the world-to-come. Since Abraham was viewed by the early church as the major illustration of the Pauline notion of justification by faith, and Genesis 15:6 was thought to 74. Letter of Barnabas 9:4. 75. Leslie W.

Even if earlier traditions could imply that Abraham's righteousness was expressed through his faith alone,78 by the middle of the second century the rabbis had no choice but to underscore his obedience to the law as the expression of his faith. Conclusions Utilizing a variety of approaches in the analysis of our passage from the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, including formula comparison, sensitivity to the use of language, theme and structural analysis, as well as concern with historical context, we have been able to accomplish three important goals. First, we have isolated the three basic units of material from which our tra- dition is constructed. Second, we now have a very good idea of how these individual blocks of material were edited together into a rather uniform, well-developed tradition which builds to a climax. While the material ascribed to R. Nehemiah (Unit B) is clearly the core of our passage, the interjection of Unit C in the midst of this block further enhances the devel- opment of the theme. Likewise, the repetition of Unit A at the conclusion of the passage with the added text from Psalm 106 frames the entire tradition and subtly clarifies the rabbinic notion of 'amanah. Finally, we have improved our understanding of the thematic aspects of this material and the purpose for which it most probably was shaped. We now know the sitz im leben of this tradition on 'amanah and how it was part of the rabbis' attempt to meet the challenge of Gentile Christianity and Gnosticism. To be sure, the analysis of one rather brief passage cannot provide us with definitive conclusions regarding the usefulness of any one of the tech- niques we have utilized. However, it has given us an indication of the extent to which a multifaceted analytic approach can heighten our understanding of how individual passages were edited as well as clarify their purposes. As a result, we have increased our appreciation of the rabbis' use of the midrashic process as a way of responding to the exigencies of their life-situations. Mid- rash was indeed a language of Jewish survival. Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion New York, N.Y. 78. See p. 15, above.</page></plain_text>
