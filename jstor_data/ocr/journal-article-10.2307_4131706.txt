Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. xii, 226 pp. Understanding the authority of "the rabbis," the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud who lived during the first five centuries of the common era, has always been a tricky business. The sages grounded their authority on the concept of the 356</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews dual Torah-the belief that God revealed to Moses, in addition to the written Torah, an oral Torah, which was passed down in an unbroken chain from generation to generation. However, the emergence of Jewish historical consciousness during the Enlightenment rendered this view difficult to maintain. The rise of critical biblical studies revealed a gap between the religion of the Bible and Rabbinic Judaism. On what basis, then, are the pronouncements of the talmudic sages authoritative for subsequent generations of Jews? In Rabbinic Authority, Michael Berger offers a sophisticated exploration of this topic. His method is that of philosophy of religion, the enterprise of employ- ing the tools of analytic philosophy "to treat issues of religious thought seriously." The book is not intended as a historical survey of the different ways Jewish thinkers have explained rabbinic authority in the past. Rather, Berger presents various mod- els that help justify, explain, and legitimate the privileged place of "the rabbis" in traditional Judaism. He hopes "to unpack the notion of the authority possessed by the talmudic Sages in Judaism and ... to lay bare the assumptions that undergird it and the implications that follow from it" (p. viii). The book is therefore a type of apologetics-in the non-pejorative sense of the term. It provides a well-reasoned defense, or various possible defenses, of tra- ditional Jewish notions of authority in light of the problems raised by modern his- torical-critical study. While Berger disavows any attempt to "justify the normative claim that a Jew must obey talmudic law or even to prove that Rabbinic authority is an internally coherent concept," these motivations seem to lurk in the back- ground. And while Berger's probing discussions certainly do not offer simplistic answers, he provides valuable resources that a traditional Jew who wishes to par- ticipate intellectually in modern Western culture could use in constructing a co- herent theology. A major virtue of the book is its honest and comprehensive analy- sis of both the utility and the problems of different justifications of authority. Berger adopts the philosopher R. S. Peters' distinction between "in authori- ty" and "an authority" to organize the models he discusses in the book's first two parts. Someone "in authority" possesses authority by virtue of holding a certain office or rank, and not necessarily because of any personal quality or character trait. This applies, for example, to army officers, government officials, and most types of institutional authorities. One who is "an authority," on the other hand, holds authority because of individual qualities, such as expertise or competence. My assessment of another person's knowledge in an area such as medicine renders that person's medical judgments authoritative for me. Chapters Two through Four begin with models of the talmudic sages "in authority." Chapter Two explores the possibility that the sages serve as "the judge in charge at the time," whom Deut. 17:9 instructs the Israelites to obey. Here rabbinic authority stems from a divine command authorizing future rabbis to determine the law. Chapter Three considers the more conventional notion that the talmudic sages constituted the Sanhedrin (or heirs to the Sanhderin), the highest Jewish judicial institution. Chapter Four locates rabbinic authority in the practice of ordination, an official licensing by which a sage received a type of certification of his position. The sages essentially stand in the place of Moses, the divinely appointed leader, insofar as they function as his substitute in each succeeding generation. 357</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review The next two chapters shift to the sage functioning as "an authority." Chap- ter Five attributes rabbinic authority to general expertise in biblical interpretation and Jewish law. One could rationally accept rabbinic authority on the grounds that the talmudic sages possessed the greatest knowledge of Torah and understanding of the divine will. Chapter Six investigates the conception of the sages as divine- ly guided, either through an oral tradition passed down since the time of Moses, through contemporary divine inspiration, or through an "indeterminate" divine policy authorizing any interpretations that future sages might propound. Berger's analysis of these models is extremely thorough. So thorough, in fact, that in each case he finds significant problems with the use of the model to satisfactorily ground rabbinic authority. Two problems, in particular, crop up re- peatedly. First, it is difficult to see why many justifications of rabbinic authori- ty should be limited to the talmudic sages, as opposed to the geonim or the me- dieval rabbis. Yet traditional Judaism considers the talmudic sages as possessing an authority far beyond that of their spiritual heirs. For example, if the talmudic sages function as "the judge in charge at that time," why is a rabbi of the tenth century (or a contemporary rabbi for that matter) any less authoritative? He, too, is the "judge in charge at that time," and should possess commensurate authori- ty. Similarly, if the sages hold authority by virtue of their expertise in interpret- ing Torah or understanding the divine will, could not later rabbis make similar claims? Second, the conclusions of modern historical study raise certain diffi- culties. Little historical evidence suggests that the Sanhedrin continued after the de- struction of the Temple, and even less that the talmudic sages actually occupied positions in the Sanhedrin. Moreover, the Sanhedrin never functioned in the dias- pora, so to see the Babylonian sages as a Sanhedrin or as heirs to the Sanhedrin is problematic. The history of the practice of rabbinic ordination is also murky, and it, too, was not practiced in Babylonia. Berger discusses the counter-arguments to each of these objections, and the issues are more complex than can be summarized here. But in these chapters the difficulties tend to outweigh the possibilities for co- herent models of authority. Part Three, "Rabbinic Authority as Authority Transformed," is the richest and most creative section of the book. Here Berger locates authority not in a con- ventional hierarchical model but in a "bottom-up" paradigm by which the people accept authority upon themselves. Chapter Seven considers whether the authority of the talmudic sages can be located as the "collective will" of the Jewish people accepting the halakhah laid out by the rabbis as normative practice. Rabbinic au- thority derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a communal decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws. Chapter Eight offers an interesting analysis of the textual authority of the Babylonian Talmud. The dictates of individual talmudic sages were transformed into the authority of a text that became the center of Jewish tradition, the object of study and basis for law of subsequent generations. Here, Berger makes use of the philosopher Ronald Dworkin's famous metaphor for understanding the way laws are interpreted in a legal tradition. Dworkin compares a legal tradition to the writing of a book, such 358</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews that one author writes the first chapter and then passes the book to a different au- thor to write the second, and to yet another to write the third. Each author is free to take the plot in a different direction, but must remain somewhat faithful to the earlier chapters if the book is to be coherent. In this view, rabbinic authority em- bodies "what those within the community living by talmudic norms feel: that their legal deliberations, their normative lifestyle, their way of ordering the world are all based on the words of the talmudic sages" (p. 124). Chapter Nine, "Rethinking Authority: Interpretive Communities and Forms of Life," invokes Wittgenstein's notion of language-games and the literary critic Stanley Fish's conception of an "interpretive community." Fish argues that while texts do not have stable meanings in any absolute sense, and hence that interpre- tation, in theory, is completely subjective, in practice we all live within "interpre- tive communities" that provide shared assumptions, rules, and conventions. For Berger, this means that rabbinic authority need not be understood separately from the traditional Jewish "form of life," which is built on such "shared assumptions" as the importance of Talmud study, the thousand-year commentarial tradition, and the centrality of normative practice. Rabbinic authority is not an external force im- posed on an individual, but is "embedded in the interpretive community's unique form of life and its actual practices" (p. 146). From some disembodied external perspective, it may be difficult to ground rabbinic authority on a sound philo- sophical basis, but from the internal worldview of the traditional community, rab- binic authority is inexorably connected to its web of beliefs, values, practices, goals, and convictions. Berger suggests that it may be more productive to describe rabbinic authority within traditional Jewish life than to justify it according to rig- orous philosophical standards. Berger's last three chapters, which offer the most helpful models for justify- ing, or at least understanding, rabbinic authority, accept the postmodern notion of the role of the interpreter in the production of meaning. We have, then, another in- teresting intersection of postmodern theories with traditional Jewish notions. As contemporary literary scholars have used post-structuralist literary theories to shed light on rabbinic midrash, so Berger employs Wittgenstein, Dworkin, and Fish to offer new perspectives on the traditional doctrine of rabbinic authority. Ultimately, one wonders whether this reframing of the issue successfully re- sponds to the Enlightenment critique which "demands that some justification be provided for forgoing one's own independent judgments and decisions in order to defer to another's view" (p. 155). Berger argues passionately that it does, that re- ducing the question to "what grounds rabbinic authority" distorts a much more complex issue. Some readers may feel that Berger has finessed rather than solved the problem. Be that as it may, Rabbinic Authority is a carefully argued, profound, and meticulous analysis of this crucial tenet of traditional Judaism. Jeffrey L.
