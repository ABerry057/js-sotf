American Academy of Religion, Reflection &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 7. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996. xii , 165 pp. Manfred Vogel. Rosenzweig on Profane/Secular History. South Florida Stud- ies in the History of Judaism 141. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996. 70 pp. Franz Rosenzweig was one of the handful of major Jewish theologians and philosophers in the twentieth century, and arguably he has been the most important influence, among early twentieth-century figures, on Jewish thought of the past fifty years. But Rosenzweig is difficult and often arcane. To understand him, one must know something about German idealism, especially Hegel and Schelling, about the philosophical and historical debates of the early twentieth century in Europe, about German culture, about the historical context for his work, and about the Jewish sources he draws on. Good studies of Rosenzweig are rare. Two new books may seem like a bonanza. They are not quite that, but they are intelligent and informed. Both authors understand something about Rosenzweig. Greenberg's book is far more interesting and challenging, but both are helpful. Vogel's piece is more a long essay than a book. It asks how Rosenzweig can argue that secular history is confined to paganism and how it is associated with historicism and the problematic of relativism. These are important questions. Vogel claims that we can find Rosenzweig's argument in the first pages of a lecture delivered in 1919 called "The Spirit and Epochs of Jewish History." He translates the pages, provides a lengthy explication of their content-albeit a completely ahistorical one--and prefaces this with a discussion of Rosenzweig's response to historicism. Vogel's account is either a brilliant analysis of an underappreciated text or an exaggerated belaboring of a minor one. I am inclined to think that his pedantic essay is only the latter. Vogel understands Rosenzweig, but he forces these pages to yield more than they contain. He never uses other writings to illuminate the issues, and the</page><page sequence="2">148 BOOK REVIEWS long, tedious footnotes, while often accurate enough, do not add much to the ponderous examination of a relatively marginal text. His ten-page "chapter" on the philosophy of history is itself virtually unnecessary and ahistorical; its gist could be had in a brief paragraph or two. Perhaps Vogel's most egregious fault is to fail to appreciate the development of Rosenzweig's thinking about history, politics, religion, and redemption--from his first encounter with Meinecke and Rickert in 1907 in Freiburg, through his intense discussions with Rosenstock in 1913 and after, to his reaction to the war and German politics, and the publication of his Hegel book and the Star in 1921. Even if Vogel is right, that in 1919 Rosenzweig argued for the coincidence of pagan relativism and profane history, his book never clarifies when, how, and with what implications this conception arose in Rosenzweig's mind and whether it is carried over to the Star unchanged. Greenberg's book is much richer and more intriguing. She focuses on the Star and the texts grounded in it; she understands much of what Rosenzweig seeks to accomplish and how he goes about his project. Her goal, which she states very explicitly, is to identify features of Rosenzweig's thought that have become, or could become, elements of a postmodern interpretation of Judaism, e.g., the relational self, the role of liturgy and gesture, and the "trope of the face." Another goal is to point out similarities between Rosenzweig's thinking and kabbalistic views. In order to accomplish these twin tasks, Greenberg examines Rosenzweig's development of three central notions--creation, revelation, and redemption-in terms of his use of art, speech, love, prayer, and face-to-face community. These three chapters form the core of her book, and they are much the best part of it. They are prefaced by chapters on the new thinking, dialogical thinking, mysticism, and brief discussions of Heidegger, Benjamin, and Levinas. The book concludes with some critical comments on Rosenzweig's treatment of Judaism and other religions and an acknowledgment of recent developments in postmodern Jewish thought, e.g., by Eugene Borowitz. The strength of Greenberg's account of the central concepts of the Star is that she points to interesting themes, topics, and problems and identifies issues worth exploring. For example, she calls attention to the role of language in creation and points out that a comparison of Rosenzweig and Schelling on Genesis 1 would be helpful. But when she turns to the task, she disappoints. So it is with her discussion of language in Benjamin and in figures like Hamann and Herder. Similarly, Greenberg nicely notices the importance of Rosenzweig's treatment of art and points to a comparison with idealist and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 149 romantic theories of art. But what she does is not very helpful. Statements that are provocative and interesting go completely unclarified, e.g., "[Rosenzweig] establishes a link between art as the language before revelation and speech as the language of revelation" (p. 74). And when she says that Rosenzweig, in the first part of the Star "develops aesthetics as an epistemological category," no effort of any kind is made to explain what this statement means. Revelation is the central category of the Star. Greenberg's chapter on it is the most coherent piece of reasoning in the book. She recognizes that language plays a complex role in Rosenzweig's understanding of revelation. On the one hand, language precedes and follows the event of revelation; on the other, revelation itself is linguistic or at least dialogical. Greenberg seems to appreciate this tension by distinguishing "audible speech" in revelation and "texts" prior to and after it (p. 81). But she has her own way of putting the problem. She refers to Rosenzweig's "hermeneutical turn, from the notion of speech as revelatory to the notion of a revelatory text" (p. 82); she asks how biblical speech can be revelatory, since it is a text about a past event and not itself living speech in the present (p. 83). Her answer is that for revelation the Song of Songs "is literally the dialogue between humanity and God" (p. 88). "The embodied speech of the Song of Songs is not a description of revelation; rather it is the embodiment of revelatory speech" (p. 88). Greenberg clarifies this claim by discussing Rosenzweig's and Zohar's interpretations of the Song, the role of love in revelation, and the way in which the reader's interpretation of a text is constitutive of the text's meaning. In a sense, then, she is raising the question of how the event of revelation is related to the linguistic response to it. Her answer is that in a sense they are the same. The text "embodies" the revelatory speech, which by itself is language without meaning. But this account is confused and mistaken. For Rosenzweig, revelation is dialogical or dialectical but not literally linguistic. It is an event or set of events, involving a loving encounter between the divine and the human, and while there is a sense in which any response in language is part of it, such response is a distinguishable part. There is a middle ground, so to speak, between detached description and identity; language can be neither but rather is a response to revelation, a human attempt to grasp the meaning of the Divine Presence and a device whereby the human seeks to confirm ever again the relationship that frames that meaning, between the divine and the human. Greenberg mistakes the way in which the biblical text is central for Rosenzweig. It is not literally the divine revelation; it is the historically preeminent human interpretation of the meaning of Jewish existence as an existence with God, articulated in</page><page sequence="4">150 BOOK REVIEWS response to the original, founding event of revelation for the Jewish people and their destiny, their "orientation" through history. Greenberg's chapter on redemption, if less realistic and concrete than it might be, is very helpful. She nicely sees redemption for Rosenzweig as "yearning to overcome the imperfections of the human condition" (p. 103) and as the soul's yearning for the endurance and permanence of God"s love (p. 104). As she points out, this is also a yearning to embody that love in a human community of intimacy, concern, and love; hence it leads to a social act or a life of "social acts [that reflect] love of neighbor and the bond of community" (p. 104). But although she has a good grasp of the social, aesthetic, and metaphysical aspects of redemption, Greenberg unfortunately succumbs to a spiritual or theological emphasis. In a sense, for Rosenzweig, one can speak of redemption as the creation of a perfect social world by partners in social life or as a vehicle for drawing close to God--or as both of these. The best interpretation, I believe, is one that never severs the relationship between these two dimensions of redemption. This is really what seeing God in a human face amounts to (pp. 114, 116); Rosenzweig's goal for history is both theological and political. In Greenberg's account, however, there is a tendency to spiritualize this goal, subordinating the love of man to the love of God, rather than seeing the two as fully co-instantiated. The remainder of Greenberg's book, its early and late chapters, is less good. Her brief, sketchy treatments of figures from Feuerbach, Cohen, Rosenstock, Ebner, and Buber to Schelling, Heidegger, Benjamin, and Levinas barely scratch the surface and do not contribute much of substance to her argument. Moreover, her overall strategy is to treat Rosenzweig as a bridge between the existential reaction to Enlightenment religious thought and trends now associated with postmodernism and figures like Levinas. Thus, Greenberg's book is akin to the recent books by Handelman, Gibbs, and Cohen. In order to make her case, she points to themes like love, poetry, gesture, and prayer and ideas like that of the relational self, and she makes much of the comparison between Rosenzweig and the Kabbalah. Doubtless there is something in this kind of approach; it would be surprising if recent thinking did not develop ideas prominent in Rosenzweig's thinking. But Greenberg is much too uncritical. Rosenzweig was certainly deeply indebted to German idealism, romanticism, and reactions to traditional philosophy and theology. He may have made poetry, love, and prayer central to his understanding of religious existence. But Greenberg does not question deeply enough</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 151 whether he uses these notions in the same way as earlier and more recent thinkers, nor does she evaluate the significance of his debts and departures. Furthermore, Greenberg restricts her critique to some rather conventional worries about Rosenzweig's portrayal of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. She does not ask whether the Star succeeds in its primary goal, to provide a philosophical, systematic justification for Jewish life as a mode of historical existence. In style, these two books differ dramatically, and while neither is extremely well written or engaging, both contribute something to our understanding of Rosenzweig, whose impact on contemporary understandings of Judaism continues to be felt.
