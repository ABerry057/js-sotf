<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ellen M. Umansky. From Christian Science to Jewish Science: Spiritual Healing and American Jews. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. xii, 245 pp. By the end of the nineteenth century, the pressures of modem civilization had become so exigent that alienists were decrying the prevalence of "neurasthe- nia," and William James would soon diagnose the "sick souls" whose anguished quest for relief from existential despair marked not only an enduring religious archetype but also the widening incompatibility between the demands of industrial and urban society and the needs of the psyche. One proposed remedy was Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (1875), whose author claimed divine reve- lation for herself. By 1911, Mary Baker Eddy's movement had attracted so many Jews that the B'nai B'rith had to prohibit its members from subscribing to Christian Science, which Isaac Mayer Wise felt compelled to denounce as "pure quackery" that risked becoming "an epidemic delusion" (27). Another Reform rabbi, Max Heller, blasted Jews for joining a sect that was marred by the "unintelligible twaddle which [their] female savior has managed to spin around the simplest utterances" (28). Three other Reform rabbis-Alfred Geiger Moses (1878-1956), Clifton Harby Levy (1867-1962) and Morris Lichtenstein (1888-1938)--offered instead the sincerest form of flattery. Jewish Science was erected as the last despe- rate barrier to the temptations of conversion to Mrs. Eddy's Church of Christ, Scientist. Rabbinic emulation promised to slake the thirst of Jews who were dis- affected with organized religion, who rejected the authority of law and the rhythms of ritual, or who did not discover in merely ethical emphasis a solution for their solitude and their psychic emptiness. Because this effort to elevate spiri- tual concerns did not spring from the inner dynamic of Judaic history, Jewish Science ought to have inspired its adversaries to apply Voltaire's quip about the Holy Roman Empire. But Ellen M. Umansky's subject is not easily impugned as neither Jewish nor scientific, and her version of the story turns out to be rather more interesting than that. Christian Science characteristically presented itself as an alternative to modem medicine, making pain and disease subject to the corrections of positive thinking. (Hence, satirist Tom Lehrer compared the public reaction to the multiple political crises of 1968 to "a Christian Scientist with appendicitis.") But advocates of Jewish Science did not generally proclaim the superiority of prayer to prescrip- tion drugs and asserted instead that the division of mind and body could be 216</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews overcome through spiritually enhanced healing. The Supreme Being makes medicine more effective by energizing the soul. God is the divine mind to which every mind belongs, a theology that owes far more to transcendentalists such as Emerson than to any Talmudists. Umansky is especially attentive to differences in religious thought and pastoral approaches within Jewish Science, recounting its history through its dominant figures. Though based in New York, the movement spoke with a noticeably Southern accent (which perhaps reflects the urgency of bringing home through a spiritual rejuvenation the most assimilated coreligionists). Moses, who coined the phrase "Jewish Science" and wrote its founding text of that title in 1916, was from Mobile. Levy helped organize the Centre of Jewish Science in Manhattan in 1924. But he had been born in New Orleans and confirmed in Mobile (by Moses' father, Rabbi Adolph Moses), and he could trace many of his ancestors to Charleston, including the intellectual star of the Reform Society of Israelites, Isaac Harby. Morris Lichtenstein had served as a rabbi in Athens, Georgia. If the goal had been to keep Jews away from Christian Science, Jewish Science evidently failed; Umansky doubts that even during the peak decade of the 1920s were there a thousand members. But the movement pioneered in attach- ing psychology to faith and in personalizing the experience of worship. Moses sought to inject greater emotion and more authentic prayer into the encounter with Judaism, and he increasingly insisted on its divergence from Christian Science. The expanded 1920 edition of his Jewish Science repudiated Mrs. Eddy's denial of corporeal reality as irrational. Moses failed to heal himself, however, and ended up in an insane asylum. Levy told the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1927 that Jewish Science intended to tap the expertise of "the surgeon, the physician, the psychologist, and the psychiatrist, in cooperation with the highest spiritual teachings of Judaism" (116). Lichtenstein' s materialism collided directly with Christian Science, and he advocated "soul clinics" to treat the "inner troubles" of his coreligionists. The universe was believed to be benign rather than indifferent, and to reach a benevolent God entailed meditation and petition. The power of faith could be realized through a one-on-one relationship to the deity. Such views were contemporaneous with Ich und Du (1923), but Umansky omits any mention of Martin Buber. Despite the minuscule size of the movement, Umansky finds no evidence of any contact between Lichtenstein and Moses, whose First Society of Jewish New Thought Lichtenstein renamed the Society of Applied Judaism and then the Society of Jewish Science. Levy's own center was shut down shortly after his death. Though portions of Lichtenstein's Jewish Science and Health were expected to be read and recited weekly, the movement did not intend to become a substitute for any branch of Judaism-not even Orthodoxy-but rather to comp- lement and enrich the tradition of prayer. (Manhattan services were commonly held on Sundays, not Saturdays.) The most heterodox moment came with Lichten- stein's death, when his widow, Tehilla Hirschensohn Lichtenstein (1893-1973), became the spiritual leader of Jewish Science, making it the first female-led congregation in the annals of American Judaism. Again note the parallel with Christian Science, the only significant religious movement in the United States 217</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews founded by a woman. A Hebrew-speaking Zionist bereft of ordination, Tehilla Lichtenstein was the voice of Jewish Science for more than three decades, until her death. But by then, membership had shrunk to statistical insignificance, though one worshipper was the son-in-law of the flamboyant radio evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. By the dawn of the new century, Jewish Science had been reduced to barely a hundred members, most of whom were undoubtedly on pacemakers. From Christian Science to Jewish Science exemplifies what sociologist Philip Rieff called "the triumph of the therapeutic." The pledge of the movement's Long Island synagogue, for example, was not salvation but "Health and Happiness Through Judaism" (191). Peace of Mind was the title of a volume that Morris Lichtenstein published in 1927, nearly two decades before another Reform rabbi did; and from Joshua Loth Liebman's 1946 best seller we can infer the strongest justification for Umansky's book. The injection of spirituality as a decisive value into Judaism, the compassion for those in pain (whether physical or psychic), the obligation of bikkur holim (visiting the ill), and the link between prayer and serenity-these features of Reform Judaism in the second half of the twentieth century were hardly absent from the other denominations either. Through exceptionally diligent research, Umansky has uncovered the modus operandi of a movement so tiny that her true counterparts are physicists pursuing the quark. But through sympathetic atten- tiveness, she has made Jewish Science relevant to a larger religious culture that itself nurtures the inalienable right to pursue happiness. Stephen J.
