<plain_text><page sequence="1">Minna Rozen. Jewish Identity and Society in the Seventeenth Century: Reflections on the Life and Work of Refael Mordekhai Malki. Translated from the Hebrew by Goldie Wachsman. Texts and Studies in Medieval and Early Modem Judaism, 6. Ttibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1992. x, 190 pp. Despite its presumptuous title, Minna Rozen of Tel Aviv University offers in this monograph an intelligent and informative account of the life and thought of Refael Mordekhai Malki, an interesting and multifaceted settler in Jerusalem at the end of the seventeenth century. Malki, who apparently had been a converso, lived in Livorno before arriving in Jerusalem in 1677. Trained as a physician, he seems to have acquired considerable wealth both before and during his residence in Jerusalem, allowing him considerable prestige and power as a lay leader of the city's Jewish community. On the basis of a lengthy commentary on the Torah penned by Malki containing long digressions on his own life and attitudes and on conditions in his community in general, Rozen ably reconstructs the material and spiritual sides of Malki's life in Jerusalem against the political and economic background of Jewish society under the Ottoman government. She defines her task as three dimensional: to situate Malki's life within the community of anusim in his day (she insists, albeit unconvincingly to my mind, on the singular usage of the Hebrew term for forced convert rather than the term converso or New Christian); within Jewish society in Jerusalem; and within the ideal messianic society he envisioned and described in his Torah commentary. Rozen's book is divided into three broad sections. The first is an overview of the political and social history of Jerusalem during Malki's life; the second describes his life and career in Jerusalem; the third considers Malki's intel- lectual and spiritual ruminations, including his ultimate vision of a reformed Jewish community in Jerusalem. Through this three-pronged analysis, Rozen strives to penetrate a "deeper stratum" of the personal life of Malki, "revolving about the struggle of an individual to affirm an identity" (p. 4) as a converso wishing to define his Jewish self. In the end, she views Malki as a highly</page><page sequence="2">266 BOOK REVIEWS conflicted person wrestling with his double life shaped both in Christian Europe and in the Middle East, and with his enmity and love for the Jewish people, whom he considered to be both chosen and, at the same time, "the worst of nations." The great strength of Rozen's analysis is in her treatment of the political and economic dimensions of Malki's life, integrating them most successfully into the wider picture of Jewish communal politics: relations between Jews and the Ottoman government, between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, between Jerusalem and Diaspora Jewish communities, between the wealthy and schol- arly classes, and between the various factions of rabbis living in Jerusalem. When she treats the intellectual and spiritual sides of Malki's life, however, her analysis appears less convincing. No doubt Malki's prestige among his coreligionists stemmed from his success as a physician in Jerusalem. Malki devoted significant parts of his writing to medical, geographic, and astronomical matters, including an entire treatise on medicinal plantlife in Israel and another on the pulse rate. According to Rozen, his familiarity with contemporary astronomy was even more impressive, based not only on his reading but also on his own observations of the heavens. Rozen's treatment of these matters is superficial and is presented in isolation from the other aspects of his social and intellectual life. She instead refers the reader to the introduction of a recent anthology of Malki's medical writings published by Meir Benayahu, who also fails to evaluate deeply their medical and cultural import. Rozen's description might have been enriched by a more careful assessment of medical practice in Malki's day both among Jews and non-Jews, including the currency of particular medical therapies, and by a more meaningful evaluation of his botanical and astronomical knowledge in relation to that of his contemporaries. At one point, she compares Malki's view on heliocentricity with that of Tobias Cohen, the author of the medical encyclopedia Ma'ase Tuviyyah, published in Venice in 1707. At the very least, she might have compared Tobias's medical knowledge with that of Malki. While Tobias may have appeared conservative with respect to his views on the solar system, he was in fact quite innovative and up-to-date with respect to medical theory and practice. A comparison of the two would constitute a first step in situating Malki within the context of the growing professionalization of medical practice among Jews in the seventeenth century. It would also have allowed</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 267 Rozen to consider Malki's actual level of medical sophistication and possible university training in comparison with that of a distinguished graduate of Padua's medical school. One of the critical questions in interpreting Malki's spiritual sympathies revolves around his supposed loyalty to the Sabbatian movement. The issue was first raised by Meir Benayahu in his pioneering essay on the struggle for control of the Yeshiva Beit Ya'akov of Jerusalem but refuted by Shlomo Zalman Havlin, who concluded that there was no basis for Benayahu's assumption that Malki was a crypto-Sabbatian. Minna Rozen fully accepts Halvin's position with no hesitation and little elaboration on the matter. It is a pity that she was unaware of Elisheva Carlebach's important new book, The Pursuit of Heresy: Rabbi Moses Hagiz and the Sabbatian Controversies (New York, 1990), based on her Columbia dissertation, which appeared as early as 1986. Carlebach too considers the new material presented by Havlin but arrives at the strong conclusion, contra Havlin and Rozen, that "a strong Sabbatian strand" ran through the entire struggle for control of the yeshiva and that Malki "was a crypto-Sabbatian who dedicated his career to remaking Jerusalem into a Sabbatian stronghold" (Carlebach, p. 42). This is not the place for a full reconsideration of the issue, but Carlebach's emphatic position on Malki might have obliged Rosen to reconsider her position or, at the very least, to discuss more fully and directly the matter of Malki's attitude to Shabbetai Zevi. By ruling out the possibility that Malki had Sabbatian loyalties, Rozen does not explain adequately his estrangement from his son-in-law Moses Hagiz; nor his strong ties to the Sabbatian stronghold in Livorno; nor his bizarre premonition in a dream of the death of Rabbi Moses ibn Haviv, another prominent anti-Sabbatian (the issue for her revolved around the matter of Jerusalem's tax policy); nor how a supposedly fierce anti-Sabbatian "mingled freely with Sabbatians" (p. 92), as she describes it; nor how an anti-Sabbatian "should have envisioned a messianic role for anusimn so as to rationalize their continued apostasy" (p. 98); nor how Malki's utopian blueprint of society and messianic passion square fully with his alleged anti-Sabbatianism. Rosen offers Malki's comment on Sabbatianism as "a rank weed," the unfortunate result of undisciplined study of Lurianic Kabbalah by the masses, to substantiate her view that Malki belonged to the opposition camp. But the matter cannot be resolved so easily; voicing opposition might easily conceal deep-seated appreciation. Given the ambiguities that remain,</page><page sequence="4">268 BOOK REVIEWS and given the critical importance of the matter for interpreting Malki, the question of his relation to the Sabbatian movement still appears to be an open one. Finally, there remains the issue of Malki's converso identity, his supposed "wrestling with a double life" as Rozen puts it. Unlike the issue of his Sabbatianism, there is no reason to doubt Rozen's hypothesis regarding Malki's converso ancestry. But is she fully convincing when she repeatedly argues that this background explains the duality and ambiguity that marked Malki's inner struggle "to unearth the essence of his identity" (p. 155)? She admits that Malki never refers to his Christian past. Despite her ambitious effort to compare him with such notable conversos as Isaac Cardoso, Isaac Orobio de Castro, and Uriel da Costa, Malki emerges relatively pale in comparison to the others with respect to the impact their Christian pasts had in shaping their newly constituted Jewish identities and the inevitable tensions embedded in the latter. For Malki, the dual perspective of his identity is hardly visible at all. Rozen's ambitious attempt to explain Malki's dialectical attitude of love and revulsion toward the Jewish community of Jerusalem as somehow related to the ambiguity of his converso past, including Christianity's critique of Judaism, is not fully satisfying. Might it not have been simpler to explain his conflicting postures as the result of his constant political entanglements with individuals and institutions in Jerusalem rather than to attribute them to some vague notion of converso identity? Whether or not Rozen has conclusively interpreted Malki's medical, messianic, and converso identities, she has certainly produced a stimulating, informative, and thoughtful account of the man against his time and has made a useful contribution to our less than complete understanding of the complex nature of Jewish culture and society in the seventeenth century. The editors of the new Judaic series published by J. C. B. Mohr and the translator, Goldie Wachsman, deserve special mention for producing such a readable and elegant English translation of Rozen's book. David B.
