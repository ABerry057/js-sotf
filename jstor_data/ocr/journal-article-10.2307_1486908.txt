<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEWS by MARTIN D. YAFFE James Shapiro. Shakespeare and the Jews. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. xi, 317 pp. There is some question nowadays about Shakespeare's moral obtuseness in connection with the religious and racial prejudices common to his time. In particular, the playwright is routinely excoriated, or else apologized for rather weakly, for his seemingly unfair treatment of Jews in his "Jewish" play, The Merchant of Venice. Central to its plot is the long-standing hatred between a Christian merchant, Antonio, and a Jewish moneylender, Shylock. At least three morally shocking incidents occur. Shylock grants Antonio an emergency loan interest-free, but with a pound of Antonio's flesh as collateral for late payment-shock number one! Shylock soon finds occasion to sue in court to collect his collateral-shock number two! Ultimately Shylock's suit backfires when the court surprisingly finds him guilty of being an alien--a non-Venetian--who has conspired against the life of a Venetian citizen, though when it then shows mercy by bypassing the statutory punishment of death and impoverishment (where fifty percent of Shylock's property would have gone to the state and fifty percent to his intended victim) in favor of a fine and of Antonio's merely administering his fifty percent as trustee for Shylock's heirs, it does so only with Antonio's further stipulation that Shylock convert to Christianity-shock number three! How could anyone who writes such stuff, we now ask, have been very nice to Jews? AJS Review 23/2 (1998): 235-244 235</page><page sequence="2">236 MARTIN D. YAFFE The case against Shakespeare here is twofold. On the one hand, once incidents like the foregoing are seen for what they are morally, it is hard to resist interpreting the play as a whole simply in their terms. On the other hand, the play undeniably draws from an appalling legacy of misunderstanding and mistrust of Jews in England from, say, 1290, when Jews were officially expelled, till at least 1753, when the ill-fated Jew Bill, as it was called, mo- mentarily dropped professing the sacraments as a naturalization requirement and so, in effect, opened up citizenship to Jews, who had begun to be formally readmitted under Cromwell a century earlier. Obviously the two arguments, textual and historical, are mutually reinforcing. Even so, separately or together they remain weak, and gain plausibility only where moral indignation or the like displaces critical judgment in interpreting Shakespeare's play. To see why, let us look at the historical argument first, before going on to the textual one. A convenient place to view the sort of historical evidence brought forward against the playwright is James Shapiro's recent Shakespeare and the Jews. Shapiro draws from chronicles, legal opinions, sermons, stories, plays, political pamphlets, and theological tracts surrounding what he calls the "cultural moment" of the play's first staging (p. 10). He disclaims any overall interpretation of Shakespeare's play, or of the playwright's private intentions, for that matter. He looks instead to what other Englishmen at the time are seen to have thought about Jews, and then finds in passing some evidence from the play itself to suggest that Shakespeare must have thought more or less the same. While insisting that he does not mean to condemn Shakespeare for sharing his countrymen's thoughts (pp. 121, 227),' Shapiro nevertheless does not raise the all-important complementary question that would go a long way toward either confirming his across-the-board conclusion or, rather, assumption, or else possibly distinguishing Shakespeare, and those among Shakespeare's countrymen who saw the playwright's deeper merit, from his more or less thoughtless contemporaries. It is the question of whether or how far the text of the play might show its author to have been someone who could, in the decisive respect, think about Jews independently of what he 1. In another context, however, Shapiro speaks of"Shakepeare's anti-Jewish play" (p. 221).</page><page sequence="3">SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEWS 237 understood his contemporaries to have thought about them, and who could thereby instruct or ennoble his countrymen in turn by addressing the moral shortcomings of their thoughts about Jews. Shapiro limits himself to considering the peculiar role of Jews in the development of Englishmen's awareness of themselves as a nation whose "national poet" Shakespeare was to become. According to Shapiro, in Eng- lishmen's eyes Jews became a touchstone, not so much of who Englishmen were as of what they were not. This fact would explain Englishmen's ongoing fascination with Jews, even or especially during the three and a half centuries when Jews were officially absent or only minimally present in England. Here, refreshingly, Shapiro means to correct the oversights and omissions of mainstream British historians. Jews, he finds, were never entirely absent from England. Among other things, he doubts the suddenness and thoroughness of their expulsion under Edward II and of their readmission under Cromwell--partly because documents to certify either event are hard to find, and partly because, according to the plethora of evidence that fills Shapiro's book, Englishmen do not seem to have stopped talking about Jews in the meantime. The range of popular misinformation about Jews was full enough and its availability constant enough to suggest to Shapiro that Elizabethans in particular, lacking as yet sufficiently broad national traditions of their own, needed something both alien and akin to themselves in order to measure themselves by. Differently stated, their skewed opinions about Jewish religious practices and their generally unfounded suppositions about Jews' racial characteristics, nationality, criminality, sexuality, and related matters did not merely decorate the recently formed social bond connecting all Englishmen, but helped to cement it. The more fanciful and outrageous the opinion projected onto Jews, one might say, the more we are shown of Englishmen's transitional worries about themselves in common. Or, to adapt a phrase to Shapiro's way of looking at his subject: the newly arisen nationwide prejudices about Jews recapitulated the nascent national pathology. Certainly such worries and prejudices are, as Shapiro suggests, part of the shadowy background to Shakespeare's play. Shapiro gathers them so as to allow readers of The Merchant to begin to perceive its broad themes with some historical depth. In a chapter on Elizabethan notions of Jewish criminality, for example, Shapiro points out that, although the identification of Jews with usury had long preceded Shakespeare's England, by the late 1500s it had increasingly narrowed to emphasize what was reputed to be their</page><page sequence="4">238 MARTIN D. YAFFE "outrageous and exploitative lending for profit" (p. 99). In another chapter, on Elizabethan notions of circumcision as the background to the play's "pound of flesh" theme, Shapiro cites the contemporary theological discussion about the meaning of "circumcision of the heart" in Paul's Letter to the Romans, with the suggestion that Shylock's insistence on a pound of Antonio's flesh might be a metaphor for genital circumcision or even castration (pp. 114-121). Shapiro's chapter on Elizabethan notions of conversion, moreover, adduces the suspicion that a Jewess, being uncircumcised to begin with, could easily convert and might just as easily revert to the old covenant, and speculates that such a suspicion may underlie the disturbing exchange between Shylock's runaway daughter Jessica and her Christian bridegroom Lorenzo at the beginning of Act V, where the honeymooners compare their hasty marriage to several thwarted love-affairs of classical antiquity (pp. 158-159). Finally, in a chapter on Elizabethan puzzlement over whether to consider Jews a race, a nation, or simply aliens, Shapiro remarks that "Shylock cannot really be understood independent of the larger social tensions generated by aliens and their economic practices in London in the mid-1590's" (p. 187), and, commenting on the likeness between the laws of Shakespeare's Venice and those of a typical English city under a feudal monarch, he infers that the playwright has given us a self-contradictory or "fantasy" resolution to the problem posed by Shylock (pp. 188-189): As much as it might want to, given its charter, Venetian society cannot punish Shylock simply because he is a Jew. But in the terms of the play it can convict him as a threatening alien. In order to accomplish this delicate maneuver in the space of... three dozen lines, the nature of Shylock's difficulty is reconstituted: A Jew at the start of the speech [at IV.i.344-61], three lines later he is an alien. Yet once Shylock is convicted as an alien, he can be punished, not as an alien, but as a Jew who must "presently become a Christian."2 2. See The Merchant of Venice, ed. George Lyman Kittredge, rev. Irving Ribner (New York: John Wiley, 1973), IV.i.344-90, with 1. 385 and, in particular, 11. 344-61: Tarry, Jew. The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be prov'd against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seeks the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state;</page><page sequence="5">SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEWS 239 The historical import of these and other distorted and derogatory images of Jews, according to Shapiro, was to cast doubt over whether Jews could ever be trusted as denizens, much less fellow citizens, of England. To the extent that Shakespeare may be said to have given further currency to such images, he also seems to have lent them further credibility as his national stature rose-as Shapiro finds when looking, in his concluding chapter, at the public debate over the Jew Bill more than a century and a half later (pp. 195-224). The same images continued to be invoked by opponents of the Bill, Shapiro notes, and led to its repeal barely two years after its passage, despite arguments in its favor drawn from more enlightened thinkers like John Toland, Daniel Defoe, and John Locke. Shapiro leads us to infer, though he does not put it in so many words, that the Bill might have had an easier time had Shakespeare thought better than to write The Merchant of Venice in the first place. Here is where the limitations of Shapiro's argument become apparent. Assuming that the popular images as Shapiro describes them were as decisive politically as he suggests, there seems a further need to explain why Parliament was not altogether dazzled by them, at least for a time. Why, in short, did public life become as receptive as it was to the position in favor of tolerance of Jews as articulated by Toland, Defoe, Locke, et al.? Here Shapiro is comparatively silent.3 It is testimony perhaps to the difficulty of this question And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice. In which predicament I say thou stand'st; For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly, and directly too, Thou hast contriv'd against the very life Of the defendant, and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke. All subsequent references to the play will be to this edition. 3. For example, Shapiro reads Locke's statement in A Second Letter on Toleration that "only full naturalisation could direct the Jews of England towards Christ" to mean merely that its author wrote in the grip of the prevalent anti-Jewish prejudices (p. 204). Shapiro does not consider the likelihood that Locke was in full control of a statesmanlike rhetorical ploy. Consider, in this connection, the passage Shapiro cites next, from Locke's Paraphrase and Notes on St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans on Romans 11:23: "This grafting in again seems to import that the Jews shall be a flourishing nation again, professing Christianity in the land of promise, for that is to be reinstated again in the promise made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This St. Paul might, for good reasons, be withheld from speaking out here; but, in the prophets,</page><page sequence="6">240 MARTIN D. YAFFE that it would require him to widen the scope of his inquiry, to move from the narrower question of the popular prejudices latent and prevailing at a given hour (what Shapiro seems to mean by "cultural history")4 to the broader question of how responsible statesmanship would have to discern and guide such prejudices on important public issues like the Jew Bill. Let us come closer to the point. Given at least the modest success of enlightened statesmanship in 1753 in overcoming the not entirely admirable images of Jews found in Shakespeare's then-popular play, wouldn't we have to ask, as Shapiro does not, whether Shakespeare himself might have had enough statesmanlike insight to be able to anticipate and even encourage these same possibilities, however modestly, in his presentation of Shylock?5 The moment this question occurs to us, unless we simply decide to rule out certain answers beforehand, we are forced to look again at the manifestly unflattering things said of and by Jews in Shakespeare's play, to see whether they are indeed the play's last word or whether on the contrary they might also call to mind other, more salutary images of the behavior of Jews-and of Christians--embedded as well in the psyches of his viewing and reading audience. To this second, or textual, question, we may now turn. III Let us start with the first morally shocking image, the pound-of-flesh collateral. What is the difference between looking at this image as Shapiro largely does, as something resembling (except perhaps in intent) a propaganda cartoon in its power to "haunt and disturb," and looking at it first and foremost instead as part of a Shakespearean play?6 Well, in Shakespeare's play it is pieced together with a larger story, and the full meaning of the image therefore there are very plain intimations of it" (p. 204, emphasis added). Locke's mention of Paul's possibly deliberate reticence ("for good reasons") is itself rather reticent, in such a way as to suggest that Locke himself was perfectly acquainted with the practice of rhetorical ellipsis. 4. See, for example, p. 43, with p. 189 ("the play as a cultural safety-valve") and p. 228 ("The Merchant's capacity to illuminate a culture"). 5. If so, the pro-Shylock sympathies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century actors and audiences would, to say the least, not be entirely without foundation in Shakespeare's text as understood by its author. Consider here the remark by Heminge and Condell in their introductory letter "To the Variety of Readers" in the Folio edition of 1623, that Shakespeare's "mind and hand went together." 6. "I am interested here not only in restoring a sense of the fascination and importance</page><page sequence="7">SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEWS 241 depends on its connection with the larger story insofar as the audience may be expected to discern that connection. What information does the play supply such that, when the pound-of-flesh clause first comes up, we are prepared to connect it with what has gone on before as well as with what is to come? Two things are striking. First, Shylock has already told us just why he hates Antonio. Not only is Antonio a Christian, but worse, Antonio is making Shylock the target of his one-man religious crusade against usury on the Rialto (see I.iii.36-46). Antonio, in other words, is bad for Shylock's business. Second, Shylock has also told us how he gets along with Christians for practical purposes. In response to a gracious dinner invitation by the beneficiary of Antonio's loan, Bassanio, Shylock snaps that his socializing with them is limited to business negotiations and does not include eating or drinking or praying-presumably because Shylock observes the Jewish dietary laws, including laws stipulating the proper prayers accompanying eating and drinking, which Christians do not share (I.iii.28-33). Yet lest the audience jump to the conclusion that, since Shylock appears to be an observant Jew, his pound-of-flesh clause is perfectly compatible with Jewish orthodoxy, or that Jews as such are permitted to go so far as to kill Christians out of hatred or revenge (by dubious readings of, say, Leviticus 19:17-18 and 24:17-22), Shakespeare inserts a further incident shortly after the note-signing. Shylock decides to accept Bassanio's dinner invitation anyway--"in hate," as he says," to feed upon / The prodigal Christian" (II.v.14 f.), and, in a related remark, to "help to waste / His borrowed purse" (II.v.48 f.). Given his awareness of Bassanio's prodigal spending habits, Shylock's presence at what promises to be a lavish occasion would seem to enhance the likelihood of another loan for Bassanio or even a default on the present loan with its unfortunate consequences for Antonio. The point is that in planning to eat Bassanio's food, Shylock knowingly steps outside Jewish orthodoxy as regards his dealings with Antonio. In short, circumcision held for Elizabethans but also in arguing that an occluded threat of circumcision informs Shylock's desire to cut a pound of Antonio's flesh. ... Plays, unlike sermons, are not reducible to one lesson or another, nor do they gain their resonance from being about a recognizable central theme. Surely, in the hands of a talented dramatist, the less easily definable the social and psychological currents a play explores, the greater its potential to haunt and disturb. We return again and again to Shakespeare's plays because they seem to operate in these depths and tap into the roots of social contradictions on a stunningly regular basis, leaving critics with the task of trying to explain exactly what these are and how Shakespeare's plays engage them" (pp. 114, 121).</page><page sequence="8">242 MARTIN D. YAFFE Shakespeare has presented us not with a stereotypical Jew, but with one who cannot achieve his nefarious aims within the bounds of Jewish law. Were the play to stop at this point, the passing suggestion that Shylock has deliberately disregarded his own religion here would not take us very far. But it does prepare us for how the playwright means for us to take the second moral shock to which I have referred. The second shock, Shylock's actually taking Antonio to court, receives an important comment within the play from the Duke of Venice, who presides over the trial. In his initial formal address to the plaintiff (IV.i.17-34), he pleads with Shylock to abandon his suit as an act of "mercy and remorse" toward Antonio. Antonio is said to deserve Shylock's "pity" in light of his overwhelming shipping losses, the putative cause of his failure to repay on time. Under the circumstances, the Duke adds, Shylock ought to forgive not only Antonio's penalty but some of his principal too. What is important here are the Duke's announced reasons for expecting some last-minute, out-of-court refinancing from Shylock. First, he says, everyone including himself believes that Shylock is merely stalling so as to make his eventual show of compassion more spectacular. That is, the Duke attributes to Shylock a sense of theatrics. Second, there is also the depressing magnitude of Antonio's reported losses-enough, he says, ... to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd To offices of gentle courtesy. (IV.i.29-33) That is, Antonio's misfortunes would make even hardboiled, crudely raised observers act compassionately. (Turks and Tartars come to the Duke's mind.) Hence, he concludes, "We all expect a gentle answer, Jew" (IV.i.34). The pertinent question is whether the Duke's concluding reminder that Shylock is a Jew means that he manifestly includes Jews among those who are by nature and/or upbringing ungentle. Two reasons suggest he does, but then again a third seems to override them. First, a pun on "gentle" yields "gentile," implying that the Duke is seeking a gentile or un-Jewish answer from Shylock, and second, the Duke has already confided to Antonio privately that he considers Shylock incorrigible (IV.i.3-6). Still, third, the</page><page sequence="9">SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEWS 243 Duke, whatever his private opinion, cannot admit publicly that Shylock as Jew was "never trained" to be gentle--that is to say, by Jewish law-without weakening his earlier argument that Shylock's apparent lack of compassion was only a theatrical delay. The inescapable conclusion here is that the Duke is forced to give the public impression to Shylock and everyone else that Jewish law does after all teach moral decency, including compassion, and that Shylock, being uncompassionate, is simply being a bad Jew, that is, one who is disloyal or disobedient to his own law. This view will soon be confirmed on theological grounds by Bassanio's recent bride, Portia-who arrives late and in disguise as a friend of the court-in her stunning "quality of mercy" speech (IV.i. 182-203). The theological premise of Portia's speech is that the Lord's Prayer is a Jewish as well as a Christian prayer (see IV.i.197-200, with Matt. 6:9-13). Hence its teaching, that mercy is a necessary supplement to justice though not a replacement for it, is common to both Jew and Christian, though each is in danger of misinterpreting that teaching one-sidedly (cf. IV.i. 195-201 with I.iii.173 f.). Jews, habituated to Jewish law, tend to emphasize justice and slight mercy, while Christians, receptive to the Gospel of love, tend toward the opposite extreme. The proper mean, Portia insists, is for mercy to "season" justice (IV.i. 195). Now because she is in the first instance addressing Shylock in court, her rhetoric emphasizes mercy. Still, being mindful of Shylock's Jewish shortcomings does not make her unmindful of those of the play's arch-Christian, Antonio. Oddly, that is just why she soon goes out of her way to invite Antonio to exercise mercy by helping to reformulate Shylock's sentence (IV.i.376). Antonio, typically, overdoes it in his package proposal for how Shylock should live the entire rest of his life. This fact goes a long way toward absorbing, or rather accounting for, our third moral shock, that of Shylock's conversion. In retrospect, Antonio's excesses here turn out to be, pace Shapiro,7 the understated theme of the play as a whole. We must keep in mind that from word one, Shakespeare presents Antonio as a morose man, and yet moroseness is for Christians a sin-a "capital vice," as Thomas Aquinas calls it, for while forgivable in itself, it leads to other vices.8 In Antonio's case, that vice is connected with his routinely charitable behavior-which almost every other Venetian admires but few choose to emulate-including his public 7. See the preceding note. 8. Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologiae 11-11.35.4, with 1-11.84.3-4.</page><page sequence="10">244 MARTIN D. YAFFE crusade to replace usury on the Rialto with old-fashioned charity and his private generosity in financing Bassanio's string of prodigal, money-losing ventures. Yet because Antonio lacks a sense of justice, or at any rate of proportion, in his treatment of both Shylock and Bassanio, his form of charitableness cannot in the end be distinguished from meddlesomeness-in Shylock's legally tolerated and economically necessary loan business, for example, as well as in Bassanio's marriage. (To say the least, Antonio's trial pointedly interrupts Portia's wedding night.) What Portia cannot correct but can only expose indirectly in court, however, she can subsequently correct at home. As the denouement to her subtly contrived ring-plot, she ultimately gets Antonio to swear to give up meddling in her own family, if not in others' (V.i.238, 249-53). But to see Shakespeare's muted critique of Christian charitableness here, and to recognize just why he had to mute that critique throughout the play, we must reconsider each incident as it occurs, shocks and all, with the prospect of Portia's twin theological teaching in mind.9 None of this is to deny the possible bearing of the arguments of Shapiro and other chroniclers of moral abuses. Rather, it is to see where Shakespeare in his statesmanlike way faced those abuses more fully and constructively. University of North Texas Denton, Texas 9. For a fuller statement, see Martin D.
