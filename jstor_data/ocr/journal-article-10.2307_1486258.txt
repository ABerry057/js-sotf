<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF NARRATIVE TRADITIONS: TWO STORIES FROM SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SAFED by ARYEH WINEMAN A storehouse of narratives can be found within the literature which emerged from and gave expression to the spiritual developments in sixteenth-century Safed. These include legends, moral tales and exempla, anecdotes, and parables which can be garnered from the volumes of the kab- balistic ethical works and other literature of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries. In this study we shall seek to explore two such narratives of that period, stories which, while quite different from one another in character, both draw upon much earlier narrative traditions which have been subtly but radically remolded. The immediate aim of trac- ing the prehistory of these two stories and their routes of metamorphosis and of comparing the Safed stories with the sources which lie behind them is to clarify the literary and historical significance of the two narratives in the precise form which they acquired in the Safed experience. On a broader scale, such exploration might serve to exemplify the transformation of nar- rative traditions under the impact of a worldview and a cultural-spiritual milieu. In his commentary upon the liturgy, Seder ha- Yom, a work which con- tributed to a wide acceptance of the particular religious practices which 165</page><page sequence="2">166 ARYEH WINEMAN emerged in sixteenth-century Safed,' Moses ben Judah Makhir included a parable of a king who conceals his daughter in a closed tower while he calls throughout his realm for suitors to seek a way to enter the tower and win the love of the princess. Of the many who come and try, all eventually give up in the face of the apparently impossible task except one suitor, who persists, convinced that such a tower must logically have an opening by which to enter. His ceaseless efforts lead him to discover an opening and win for him both the encouragement of the princess, who then leads him to keys with which to proceed to the inner chambers of the tower, and the favor of the king, who accepts him as his son-in-law and reveals to him further secrets and mysteries.2 This parable bears striking similarity to a legend which Solomon Buber found in a manuscript of Midrash Tanhuma at Oxford. In that story, King Solomon seeks to avoid his daughter's marriage to a lad of extreme poverty, a match foretold by the stars. The king places his beautiful daughter in a tall tower situated in the midst of the sea, a tower lacking any opening on the outside other than an inaccessible opening on top. But when, one cold eve- ning, the poor lad clothes himself in the dead body of an ox to warm himself, a large bird carries him together with the dead ox to that very tower in the sea, where the princess then finds him. When the guest comes to the atten- tion of the king after the couple have already married, having signed a ketubbah with blood and having called angels as witnesses, Solomon recog- nizes that the poor lad, who is a scribe and possesses a sharp mind, is indeed the one whom the stars foretold, and Solomon reconciles himself to the inevitable, joyously accepting the match he had sought, at great effort, to avoid.3 In this legend, the poor scribe penetrates the impenetrable as an act of divine grace, without any intent or effort on his own part. God's intent prevails over the king's, and while the latter seeks to challenge inevitability, ultimately he can only succumb and make his peace with it. The figure of a tower in connection with an attempt to avoid the inevita- ble occurs elsewhere in Jewish legends relating to Solomon,4 and Islamic legends also relate the biblical king to the same thematics of fate and destiny, although there Solomon's position is quite different, as he claims 1.

One notes also, however, that while many narrative elements persist in the latter source, the nature of the story undergoes consi- derable change. In addition to the introduction of the suitor-contest motif,6 the older legend concerning Solomon has been transformed into a parable of the divine. It no longer relates to the biblical king nor to the theme of the futility of seeking to alter or avoid the inevitable. No longer does the king seek to avoid giving his daughter to a poor lad; instead, it is emphasized that the king, who represents God in the parable, invites all interested young men, irrespective of wealth, beauty, or family background, to seek to enter the tower. The reader no longer stands on a higher level, grasping the folly of the king's attitudes; indeed, all irony disappears from the tale. The out- lines and the basic image of the older tale serve as material for a story of a radically different nature. One might suggest that in the milieu of kabbalistic Safed, the all-encompassing intensity of mystic religious teaching allowed little place for the lighter moments of life and expression, and that the ele- ments of a tale of delight survived in the literature of the period only when reworked into the much more serious narrative mode of a parable of God, the Torah, and the mystic. A parable found in the Zohar (II, 98b-99b) served, in all likelihood, as a catalyst in the transformation. The parable describes a palace closed from all sides, with a lovely maiden in it who has only one lover; the world knows nothing of him. As he repeatedly passes in front of the palace, she makes a tiny opening in the palace, an opening which only her lover can perceive, and reveals her face to him only to disappear from his sight immediately afterward. We are then told that like the beautiful woman concealed in the palace, who momentarily reveals herself to her beloved in order to awaken his love but is unseen by all others, the Torah similarly discloses itself to the one whom it loves; it gradually reveals itself more and more and, through the level of its discourse, leads its beloved student to deeper levels of under- standing, proceeding from the plain meaning of the text to deeper levels of mystic meaning. In the parable found in Ben-Makhir's work, the image of 5. M. Griinbaum, Neue Beitrdge zur Semitischen Sagenkunde (Leiden, 1893), pp. 233-235. 6.

His comments relating to the parable emphasize the labor of learning, which requires persistence and regularity along with attention even to the most minute details. Truth does not glare a student in the face; just as the suitor, after much effort and attention to small holes and cracks, found an opening in the tower, so the student must preoccupy himself with seemingly insignifi- cant details that will serve as keys enabling him to grasp the real nature of the object of his study. Ben-Makhir states that when God beholds a student who is persistent and displays a strong desire to understand, He discloses the truth to him. This cannot occur when one approaches the Torah through surface study, as though one were reading a letter, a kind of study which never enables one to reach beyond the plain meaning of the text. The literal meaning is likened, in Ben-Makhir's discussion surrounding the parable, to an outer garment one places over his better clothes so that the latter will not become soiled, and the student who never gets beyond the literal meaning actually bestows a bad name on the Torah by equating the Torah with its surface level of meaning. The essence of the Torah, consisting of the levels of intimation and mystery, Ben-Makhir stresses, is necessarily hidden from the eyes of each and every student as he commences his study.8 The same parable appears, also, in the early-eighteenth-century work Hemdat Yamim, a homiletical description and discussion of the holy days and other occasions of the Jewish year and a work which reflects the moder- ate strand of Sabbateanism.9 The referent of the parable there similarly 7. In a study of the writings of Moses Ijayyim Luzzatto, Pinbas Lachower (Al Gevul ha-Yashan ve-he-Hadash [Jerusalem, 1951], pp. 45-49) discussed this parable from the Zohar, which he considered to be the source of the parable appearing in Seder ha- Yom and .Iemdat Yamim. He did not, however, relate the latter source to the midrashic excerpt found in the Tan- huma manuscript except to mention in a footnote that such a source exists without identifying it; nor did he compare the zoharic parable with the later parable, which is best understood as a transformation of the older midrashic legend under the impact of the zoharic parable. 8.

Like Seder ha- Yom, it insists that the real truth of the Torah lies far beneath its surface dimension and, borrowing the same claim on the part of the medieval philosophical tradi- tion,'0 accentuates the importance of intellectual endeavor. Even more emphatically, however, .Hemdat Yamim stresses the importance of the inner spiritual qualities necessary in order to penetrate beyond the plain meaning of the Torah text to its deeper truth. In contrast with the zoharic parable, the emphatic point of the parable and of its interpretation in both Seder ha- Yom and Hemdat Yamim is not the grace of the Torah's disclosure but rather the need for patient effort and labor on the part of the student. At the same time, however, understanding depends both upon the student's prolonged efforts and the strength of his desire and upon the grace of disclosure to him in the wake of his efforts; its insights transcend what the mind, by its own powers, is able to attain. The parable in those sources conveys the relation- ship of the mystic and the Torah as a love-relationship in which the student must make the initial effort and persevere in that effort, while the Torah, in its turn, responds in love by revealing itself. Insight into the Torah is an act of revelation, and such revelation is a response to the true seeker. While, in the parable, all the suitors accept the invitation and mandate of the king, they accept that mandate superficially, except for the one true seeker who displays a wholeness of will. Whether consisting of songs and praises or self-affliction and fasting, the strategies of the other suitors are short-cuts which elude the goal. In contrast, the will of the true seeker is unqualified; he stakes his very life upon his quest, as he leaves no other options for himself. His will is placed in conflict with the apparent reality of the closed tower, but beyond the image of the closed tower is the princess, who, impressed by his efforts, responds to him. Similarly, the student confronts the apparent nature of the Torah as hopelessly locked and enigmatic in character, but that image, too, with ongoing persistence, proves to be the mere manifestation of a test. In a chiasmus evident in the parable's structure, the king, at the beginning, places his daughter in the closed tower, after which we hear of him only at the story's conclusion, when he presents to the lad the keys of the palace's 10.

The older narrative elements which comprise the legend of King Solomon become the building blocks of a very different kind of story, with a pattern moving from hiddenness to disclosure, and one which, like the zoharic parable, relates to the grasp of that which is beyond the known and the reach of the human mind in itself. This kind of story voices, in other words, the central concern of Jewish mysticism. Alongside the nimshal, the explicit referent of a parable-and sometimes of greater significance-is the implicit referent which is present only in the parable itself and in its narrative details; it is neither stated in the referent nor related to the more explicit kind of polemic explained in the context." In this case, the implicit referent conveys, among other things, the paradox of a mystic approach to the Torah: the truth of the Torah is concealed in a mist of mystery; it is heavily guarded within a virtual labyrinth of chambers within chambers, each requiring a special key. Yet, at the same time, it is God's intent both that man make the effort to discover the hidden truth and, furthermore, that man penetrate the mystery. The Torah-truth is hid- den not in order to bar man from it but rather to present the kind of chal- lenge necessary to enable one to penetrate to the depth of that truth. Similarly, the mystic, experiencing the Torah as an enigma beyond his grasp, is yet confident that, like the locked tower, it, too, must have a key. Examining further the narrative details of the parable from Seder ha- Yom and Hemdat Yamim, one glaring difference stands out when the parable is compared with that of the palace found in the Zohar, a difference which is possibly crucial in suggesting the significance of the parable in those later sources. The earlier parable, found in the Zohar, speaks of the one lover whom the Torah leads to more and more inner dimensions of its teachings, a lover hidden from the notice of human society; the very fact of the princess's presence in the closed palace is a guarded secret. The parable found in the two later sources, in contrast, suggests that God chooses to encourage as many as possible to seek the way of the mystic truth. Throughout his vast realm, the king announces his daughter's presence in the tower in order to summon to the test all those who wish to accept the challenge to seek her. In the light of this contrast, the parable from Seder ha- Yom and IHemdat Yamim can be seen to mirror the transition from the conception of Kab- 11. A somewhat similar suggestion is made by Joseph Dan (Ha-Sippur ha-Ivri bi-Mei ha-Beinayim [Jerusalem 1974], p. 28) in reference to the philosophical parable in medieval Jewish literature.</page><page sequence="7">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF NARRATIVE TRADITIONS 171 balah as an esoteric teaching designated for the select few, a teaching to be carefully hidden and guarded, to that of a more popular conception of mystic learning as a teaching intended for the many, the kind of transition which, in significant measure, marked the sixteenth century.'2 II Several texts, dating from the beginning of the seventeenth century and extending toward the middle of the following century, include a legend of Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim, an historical figure of sixteenth-century Safed, who beheld the Shekhinah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Bewildered by what he saw, the rabbi was consoled by the Shekhinah as she uttered the very words which in Jeremiah, chapter 31, God spoke to Rachel, weeping as her children pass by her gravesite on their way to exile. In addition to the use of the text of Jeremiah in the legend, the Ari (Rabbi Isaac ben Solomon Ashkenazi Luria), in most versions of the legend, identifies Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi as a metempsychosis of Jeremiah. The encounter between the rabbi and the Shekhinah in the legend appears as a refraction of the brief narrative passage in Jeremiah 31:14-16, a refraction, however, which has undergone several transformations before assuming the form and character of the legend which relates to the sixteenth-century personality. In sources as varied as a first-century pseudepigraphical text, an early medieval midrashic work, and an early medieval liturgical poem, one finds the highly symbolic figure of a woman weeping and mourning at the time and scene of the destruction of Jerusalem. The oldest known of these literary sources is the pseudepigraphical work, the Apocalypse of Ezra, known also as IV Ezra or II Esdras, written toward the very end of the first century C.E. as an expression of theological questions and reflections which emerged in the wake of the destruction of the Second Commonwealth.13 In the fourth of a series of visions in the book, the seer-persona Salathiel (Ezra) meets a 12. This is true in a general, not a total sense, as the more advanced levels of kabbalistic teaching were still reserved for the inner circles of students; speaking more broadly, however, in this later period Kabbalah is intended for and accessible to the community as a whole. 13.

Charles, The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1913), 2:561.</page><page sequence="8">172 ARYEH WINEMAN woman who is first seen weeping bitterly with all the signs of bereave- ment-ashes upon her head, rent clothes, and a grievous spirit-as she is mourning the death of her only son on his wedding day and refuses all con- solation.'4 The seer criticizes her bitter mourning by comparing her situa- tion with the greater tragedy of the destruction of Jerusalem. Then, as the seer is still speaking with her, her countenance is suddenly transformed to shine brilliantly, and later, in her place, the persona beholds a rebuilt and expanded city, and the angel Uriel then identifies the woman as Mother Zion, who had been mourning the destruction of Jerusalem.'5 In certain later sources the explicitly symbolic figure of Mother Zion as found in IV Ezra, a bereaved woman personifying the city and its people, merges with the scene of Rachel's weeping from Jeremiah 31. Like the Apocalypse of Ezra, the setting in those later sources is similarly the destruc- tion of the First Commonwealth at the hands of the Babylonians in the sixth century B.C.E. In none of these is the figure of the weeping woman identified as Rachel, even when the motif, the situation, and the language all reflect the passage from Jeremiah. This tradition exists alongside those postbiblical interpretations of the episode of Rachel weeping for her children which understood the biblical passage on an essentially literal level.16 Turning to a considerably later source, an early medieval midrash, Pesikta Rabbati, includes a legend in which Jeremiah, returning to Jerusa- lem after having left the exiles, sees, upon a mountain, a woman with disheveled hair and clad in black, weeping and pleading for comfort. As in the visionary account in IV Ezra, here, too, the plight of the grieved woman is initially compared with the much greater tragedy of the destruction of Jerusalem until she identifies herself as Mother Zion. The prophet then offers her words of comfort with the promise that in the time-to-come, God 14. Ibid., p. 603. 15. A connection between the fourth vision from IV Ezra and the later midrashic literature appears in that the bereaved woman in IV Ezra is said to be mourning the death of her only son, who died on the morning of his wedding day. In certain midrashic sources (Eikhah Rabbah, proem 24; Eikhah Zuta, second version, #20, ed. Solomon Buber [Berlin, 1894], p. 144), God, similarly, is said to liken His situation at the destruction of Jerusalem to that of a father whose only son died beneath the wedding canopy. It would seem that both IV Ezra and those later midrashic sources ultimately draw upon an earlier shared tradition. 16. Eikhah Rabbah, proem 24 and parallels. Whereas modern biblical scholarship under- stands the passage in Jer. 31:14-16 as referring specifically to the tribes of the northern king- dom who were exiled at an earlier period, the midrashic sources make no such distinction and interpret the passage in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem and the beginning of the Babylonian Exile.</page><page sequence="9">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF NARRATIVE TRADITIONS 173 Himself will rebuild Zion, which, until then, had been both built and destroyed by human hands."7 While this midrashic legend echoes the vision from IV Ezra in significant ways, it also differs in that, unlike the pseudepi- graphical source, in which the seer-persona witnesses a vision of the renewal of the city, in the midrashic legend the renewal occurs only on the level of prophecy concerning the future. One finds a very similar situation described in a lament for the Ninth of Av, Az Bimlot Sefek Yafah Ketiraah, written by Eleazar Kallir.'8 The poem depicts Jeremiah's encounter, while wandering from the Temple Mount, with a beautiful woman shattered by grief. In her dialogue with the prophet, she explains herself to be the people Israel and implores the prophet to plead before God to save her children from death and exile and to awaken the patriarchs from their rest "because the wolves of the steppe have seized and torn the lamb." The poem, which describes the Temple site in a state of desolation, concludes with the woman's plea before God to have compas- sion for Zion and to restore its people. In the light of all the above sources, the legend of Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim appears to be an expression of a legend-tradition which has spanned many centuries, one which has largely recast the dialogue between God and Rachel in Jeremiah 31 into a dialogue involving the sym- bolic figure of a woman in mourning who symbolizes Jerusalem and Israel. Yet the similarities also direct attention to an essential difference which separates the Berukhim legend from IV Ezra, the Pesikta Rabbati passage, and the Kallir lament, differences which indicate a new turn given to a much older legendary motif: while in those earlier sources the female figure is a symbolic personification of Israel and Jerusalem, in the Berukhim legend she transcends that role and is identified as the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. A sign in the direction of this development can be heard already in a pas- sage in Tanna de-vei Eliyahu where, following reference to Rachel's weeping and to God's promise given her of her children's eventual return to their land, the midrash comments, "Read this not as Rahel [Rachel] weeping for her children, but rather as Ruah-El [the spirit of God] weeping for her 17.

In the interpretation of the same passage from Jeremiah as found in the Zohar, it is explicitly the Shekhinah who weeps. The Shekinah ... at the destruction of the Temple revisited all the spots where she had formerly dwelt and wept for the habitation and for Israel who had gone into exile and all those righteous ones and saints who perished there. God thereupon said to her, "What aileth thee?" . . the Shekinah replied with tears ... "Seeing that my children have gone into exile and the Sanctuary is burnt, what is there left for me that I should linger here?" And the answer of the Holy One, blessed be He, was "Refrain your voice from weeping, etc." (Jer. 31:15)21 The older legend-tradition has acquired a new dimension, as it is now grasped through the prism of the worldview of Kabbalah. The older con- cept of the Shekhinah as an expression of the immanence of God22 has become the tenth of the sefirot, the forms or aspects assumed by the divine light and being. In addition, as the Shekhinah alone among the sefirot is considered to be feminine, it has become the logical candidate for the role of the weeping woman at the scene of the destruction of Jerusalem. In zoharic exegesis, many female figures in the Toraitic narratives, including, for example, Rachel as she meets Jacob,23 serve to symbolize the Shekhinah. Furthermore, the Shekhinah is regarded as a divine prototype of the people of Israel,24 a detail which points to lines of continuity with older pre- kabbalistic expressions of the same legend-tradition. 19.

Ibid., p. 20b.</page><page sequence="11">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF NARRATIVE TRADITIONS 175 A further metamorphosis of significance is evident, as the same legend- tradition connects with the Ari and, more centrally, with Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim,25 who lived in Safed during the sixteenth century. The legend which now emerged, like many others which relate to the Ari, demonstrates the latter's wondrous knowledge, which far trans- cends human norms. In this particular story, he knows when a person is approaching death and in what circumstances a specific number of years can be added to that person's life span. The role of the Ari in the legend belongs to its frame, while the epiphany, which constitutes the dramatic center of the legend and definitely overshadows the frame, relates to Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim. Born in Morocco in 1515, Berukhim settled in Safed approximately half a century later. There he became a follower of Rabbi Moses Cordovero, but like several others of Cordovero's circle he became associated, following Cordovero's death, with a group of followers of the Ari. Several of the popular texts presenting the values and spiritual world of Lurianic Kabba- lah provide a picture of his evangelical activity in Safed both in strengthen- ing the observance of the Sabbath and in awakening the townspeople to participate more vigorously in expressions of repentance, in particular the practice of the Midnight Vigil (tikkun .bazot) in which the Jew awakens in the middle of the night to lament the destruction of the Temple and the Exile of the Shekhinah in a rite which is then followed by study.26 In his mystical autobiography, Sefer ha-Hezyonot, Rabbi Hayyim Vital refers to Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim as one who is able to move people to repen- tance even against their will, and he comments, furthermore, in reference to Berukhim, that the name of Elijah the prophet, who is to appear before the Messiah's coming, has been changed to Abraham, through whose efforts redemption will come.27 The legend is found in a letter written by Shlomel of Dreznitz in 1607,28 the third of the latter's epistles from Safed, as well as in several other sources 25.

There, after devoting three days and nights to weeping and fasting, he proceeded to pray at the Western Wall, where he saw, above the Wall, the likeness of a woman clad in a manner which, out of respect for the divine, he would not describe. He responded by prostrating himself and crying, "Mother, Mother, Mother Zion," and in bitter weeping he struck his face and pulled the hairs of his beard and hair until he fainted. Breaking the more conventional folktale pattern of a deed (or omen) to ensure prolonged life,35 the disclosure of the Shekhinah cast Berukhim into the most intense weeping. The Shekhinah then appeared to him in a dream, drying his tears, and told him, "Be com- forted, my son, Abraham, for there is hope for your future, and the sons will return to their border, for I will turn back their captivity and be compas- sionate to them" (Jer 31:16). He awoke from his deep slumber and joyously returned to Safed, where the Ari perceived from Rabbi Abraham's counten- ance that the latter had, in fact, beheld the Shekhinah, and we are informed that Rabbi Abraham lived for another twenty-two years. The twenty-two years added to Berukhim's life relate to the association, in kabbalistic thought, of the Shekhinah with the Oral Torah, often as a personification of the Mishnah composed of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.36 In terms of the more specific context of this legend, the 29.

The legend includes a dual epiphany; in the first, Rabbi Abraham merely beholds the Shekhinah, while in the second she speaks to him. The first is thoroughly sorrowful in character, while in the second she mandates con- solation to him. Her words "My son, Abraham" appear to be addressed both to Rabbi Abraham and to the people of Abraham our father, whom the Shekhinah consoles through him. The reader notes, also, that the pat- tern of the dual epiphany recalls that found in the Apocalypse of Ezra. But while this legend of an encounter with a female figure at the site of the Temple's destruction echoes the passage from Jeremiah and the older examples of the legend-tradition of the symbolic figure of a bereaved woman, certain reversals of roles are evident in it. Most significantly, unlike the other examples and unlike the passage in Jeremiah 31, the female figure is not weeping; it is the man, Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim, who weeps, while the Shekhinah consoles him. The legend bespeaks not divine empathy for the plight of Israel's exiles but rather the empathy of the Jew for the divine and for the Exile which the divine experiences. Divine empathy has given place to the theme of the Exile of the Shekhiinah so important in the teaching of Lurianic Kabbalah, which saw in Israel's suf- fering and exile a symbol of the divine experiencing the pain of a greater Exile.37 In the process, the legend has become infinitely more appalling, even as, in daring legendary expression, it has moved to the brink of experiencing the divine in human form. Equally significant is the time of the vision and of the encounter: unlike all the older examples, it occurs not at the time of the destruction of Jerusa- lem but rather very close to the time of the legend's actual appearance, as it relates to two historical personalities who could both be present in Safed only during the very last years of the Ari's life, from 1570 to 1572, when the latter resided in Safed. It is a legend which, in its time, spoke not of the remote past but of the present. These changes and reversals of roles can serve as keys to a more precise understanding of the legend of Berukhim and the Shekhinah. It is of the nature of legend that older stories and motifs are often 265-268. The version of the legend in Emek ha-Melekh explains the twenty-two years as relat- ing to "the Shekhinah who is the Oral Torah which is constructed of twenty-two letters." 37.

This legend of Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim, in contrast, closely mirrors the specific activity of the devout man and his specific hour of history. More than anyone else in Safed, Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim is associated with the practice of the Mid- night Vigil, which took firm root there during his time. "He would prepare early for the Midnight Vigil, walking around the marketplaces of the town to the street of the Jews, and he raised his voice in bitter crying," recalling to his townspeople the Exile of the Shekhinah and the tragic destruction of the Temple. And he would knock upon the doors and entrances of the houses of the holy community of Safed and would not give rest or quiet to any of the people of Israel, and they would rise in awe and dread at the early hour until the sound of those studying Torah could be heard quite some distance away.39 The rite of the Midnight Vigil epitomizes most clearly the ascetic character of the kind of ritual which was created in sixteenth-century Safed. That type of rite is basically one of mourning, even while its ultimate significance is to transcend the element of grief in making for a world in which exile and dis- repair are annulled. In the legend, when the devout figure is told to go to the Western Wall, the site of the Temple's destruction, he is cast into a state of intense weeping. The reader is led to understand that due to the depth of the sorrow which the destruction of Jerusalem and the Exile of the Shekhinah have elicited in him, he is able to perceive the figure of the Shekhinah upon the Wall. Then, upon seeing the Divine Presence in a manner signifying her dejected state of exile, his grief deepens to the point of fainting. Immersed in weeping he reaches a kind of death-point in the account which then gives ways to a dream-vision in which the Shekhinah brings him out of his great sadness. Now no longer helpless, the Shekhinah not only dries his tears, acting out God's words to Rachel in Jeremiah 31:15, "Withhold . . . tears from your eyes," but also promises a different kind of future, one which parallels the new lease of life given to Berukhim. The rhythm of the legend gives expression to the basic formula underlying the ascetic rite which appeared following the expulsion 38.

The way to the gates of tikkun, the repair of sin and exile, lies in immersing oneself in grief. As the weeping figure in the legend, Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim suggests the role of the Jew in lamenting the Exile of the Shekhinah, and the legend serves as a paradigm of such lament and of its significance. Kay ha- Yashar explicitly brings the legend as a model for each and every Jew to follow in awakening for the Midnight Vigil.41 The legend's location in time in the sixteenth century rather than at the hour of Jerusalem's destruction makes for a thrust which is directed not to the past destruction but rather to redemption. This note is voiced forcefully though subtly in the Ari's identification of Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Beru- khim as a metempsychosis (gilgul) of the prophet Jeremiah,42 with its particular ramifications for the legend. That identification on the part of the Ari may well have been the genesis of the Berukhim legend, for we are told that the Ari also identified others of his contemporaries as metempsychoses of significant figures from biblical and talmudic times.43 The identification implies a comparison of the prophet's generation with that of the devout man from Safed: Jeremiah had failed to bring his contemporaries to the kind of repentance which could have averted the destruction and the consequent exile, whereas Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim, in his day, succeeded in large measure in awakening his generation to repentance. That awakening is represented by their participation in the Midnight Vigil-which by nature 40.

Kav ha- Yashar, chap. 93. The same legend in slightly different form appears in Hemdat Yamim, vol. 2, p. 4a, in the context of a discussion of the vigil observed on the day of fasting and reflection which precedes the appearance of the new moon. That ascetic rite establishes a con- nection between the blemish in the moon's light, the days of darkness preceding the reappear- ance of the moon, and the Exile of the Shekhinah. The rite, as described in Hemdat Yamim, is a distinctively Sabbatean ritual (Gershom Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism [Lon- don, 1965], pp. 152-153; also Behinot be-Vikkoret u-ve-Sifrut, vol. 8 [Jerusalem, 1955], pp. 15-16), and while it is not explicitly mentioned in the legend of Rabbi Abraham ben Eliezer Berukhim in that source, the description of the rite in the textual context of the legend has the effect of providing a sanction for the later Sabbatean rite in the practice of the generation of the Ari and of Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim. 42.

The act of a physical awakening from slumber parallels an inner event of spiritual awakening. Berukhim's endeavor bore significantly greater fruit and, hence, with it bore promise of awakening divine compassion. This comparison is, indeed, made very explicit in Hemdat Yamim: "Whereas when Jeremiah used to rebuke Israel they neither listened nor inclined the ear, now [Rabbi Abraham's] fear and awe fell upon all Jews, all of whom accepted his discipline.""44 The age of Jeremiah is associated with the Exile of the Shekhinah. The movement of repentance with its ascetic rites in the time of Rabbi Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim is, conversely, a sign of the movement toward redemp- tion and, with it, the restoration of the Shekhinah to her former glory. Hence the parallel must be understood as mirroring a basic confidence that the community of Safed was clearly on the path of tikkun, of the repair of exile itself. In sharp contrast with other legends of that same time and place, such as those of the failed redemptive moment,45 this legend suggests a con- fidence with no place for despair. The older legend-tradition has been radically remolded in such a way that the very scene of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Exile of the Divine Presence becomes the scene of a promise of imminent redemption in the wake of the expressions of repen- tance and spiritual awakening in the Safed community. Sufficient attention has yet to be given to the narrative art evident in the legends, moral tales, and parables preserved largely either in the collections of legends or in the popular kabbalistic ethical texts written in sixteenth- century Safed and elsewhere throughout the following century and a half. A significant aspect of that art is suggested in the ability to remold much older narrative traditions in a way that gave expression to the particular spiritual world of sixteenth-century Safed and to its sense of its own hour in history.
