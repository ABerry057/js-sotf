New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003. 350 pp. Perhaps no subject is more actual than the relationship of Zionism and the State of Israel to the exercise of military power. Ehud Luz's passionate cri de coeur appears, at first glance, to cover much the same ground as Anita Shapira's earlier Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881-1948: both books analyze com- prehensively the way Zionist thinkers, writers, and activists struggled with the moral limitations on the use of force and violence in the acquisition of Jewish sov- ereignty. But Shapira's focus is more on political history, while Luz treats primar- ily writers and rabbis, ranging from the ultra-Orthodox pacifist Aharon Shmuel Tamares, the Labor Zionist poet Natan Alterman, the messianic Zionist Zvi Yehu- da Kook, and the secular apocalyptic Uri Zvi Greenberg. Where Shapira ends her story with what she describes as the emergence of a new Israeli mentality in the wake of the 1948 war, Luz brings the debates up to virtually the present day. Shapi- ra leaves readers-perhaps unwittingly-with the impression that the values of havlagah (self-restraint) which characterized Labor Zionism in the 1930s were largely replaced by a more ruthless ethos of retaliation: after 1948, Labor Zionism came to adopt the position of its Revisionist archrival. Yet, as Luz demonstrates, the debates of the prewar period continued, if in a new key, in the half-century af- ter Israeli sovereignty. It is not, however, only in chronological terms that these two works differ. Luz's agenda goes beyond the historical since he also wishes to engage philo- sophically the very questions raised and contested by his sources. He holds that Zionism has been-and continues to be-driven by countervailing views on the role of power. As a revolt against the ostensible passivity of the diaspora Jews, Zionism sought to ground the relations of Jews and non-Jews in the vocabulary of modem nationalism. But this revolution could not escape the Jewish past because the tradition continued to echo in the very terminology with which the Zionists cast their arguments. For example, the idea of a Zionist "wager"-daring to accom- plish something seemingly fantastical-drew directly from the traditional idea of a "saved remnant." Similarly, the Zionist slogan of hagshamah (self-realization) recasts the medieval philosophical term for materiality; thus, Zionist realization meant in Jewish terms to make the spiritual material. For Luz, the Zionist indebtedness to Jewish sources is not only descriptive- ly true, but is also as it should be. Rejecting the universalist ethics of Kant, he turns instead to Hegel's idea of Sittlichkeit, arguing that ethics are always refracted through the prism of particular cultural traditions. It is therefore only right that an ethical debate about the limits of Jewish power should take place in the framework of the historical tradition. In Luz's reconstruction of that tradition, the Bible emerges as an ambivalent text that celebrates military victory, but only in the con- text of an ethical theology. As opposed to militaristic cultures for whom honor and shame are central, the Bible--and later Jewish tradition-foregrounds guilt and repentance. It is this difference that explains the denigration of military virtues in 192</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews rabbinic and medieval Jewish culture. Here, I believe that Luz somewhat overstates his case. As I argued nearly two decades ago, Jews did not entirely abandon arms and warfare during the Middle Ages, just as they were not wholly an apolitical people. Nevertheless, as Jews entered modernity, their self-perception, as well as others' perceptions of them, was as physically passive and pacifistic. The Zionist revolution targeted a real self-perception and not only one that the Zionists manu- factured. Luz believes passionately in bringing to bear the manifold texts of the Jew- ish tradition on contemporary debates about the future of Israel. He is clearly ex- ercised by the fundamentalist interpretation of traditional sources by the religious right, who claim that halakhah and morality have nothing in common. He sees the new concept of da'at torah (which he implicitly understands as something like the Islamic fatwa) as a dangerous departure from argument based on sources. He ar- gues instead, following the general lines of the liberal orthodoxy associated with the Hartman Institute, that the halakhah does not foreclose autonomous morality. On the contrary, it enshrines the idea of "righteousness beyond the law." There should be no contradiction between universally accepted political norms and the dictates of the Jewish tradition. Luz's book occupies a difficult, but in this reviewer's eyes, essential position between, on the one hand, anti-Zionists and post-Zionists who believe that Jews can only be moral without power, and, on the other, messianists who believe that any exercise of power by Jews is inherently just. There is, he insists, a moral price to be paid for sovereignty, but there is an equal, perhaps greater, moral price for the lack of sovereignty. Forced to self-defense, Zionism, in his account, has never succumbed to militarism and the very intensity of the debates within Israel is proof that the moral price of sovereignty remains very much on the public agenda. I have some reservations about this position. At one time, moralistic soldiers were said to be those who "shoot and then cry" (yorim ve-bokhim). Crying after the fact made the shooting more palatable, as if recognition of the quandary of be- ing forced to kill was itself the answer to the quandary. At what point do debates about the ethics of power cease being real debates and become instead unwitting forms of legitimation of the very practices the debaters condemn? What I am miss- ing in Luz's book, then, is an examination of the role of Israel's internal discourse over power and morality in the functioning of its power. But even if that discourse should turn out to be more insidious than many of its practitioners imagine, Luz has made a powerful and compelling contribution to its understanding. Without concealing his own deeply held convictions, he judi- ciously gives a wide variety of opinions their due, and, in the process, reconnects Zionism with its profoundest roots in the Jewish tradition.
