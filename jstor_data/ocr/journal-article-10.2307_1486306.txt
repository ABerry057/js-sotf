<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HOUSEHOLD TABLE IN RABBINIC PALESTINE by JOSEPH TABORY Bar-Ilan University D. Sperber has confirmed,' from rabbinic sources, the argument of J. Drescher (Le museon 82 [1969]: 98-100) that 7rpdirfa was used to mean a "paten, tray, dish" in addition to its better known meaning of "table." We shall here try, through the use of rabbinic sources, to show the real, archaeo- logical background behind the semantic change from "table" to "tray" and to suggest that this background may have been a cause of that change. First, let us point out two important characteristics which were common to tables mentioned in rabbinic literature and to those with which we are familiar in the Greco-Roman world. The first characteristic is that the standard table, although of oblong shape, was equipped with three legs.2 Although the three-legged table has the advantage of steadiness on an uneven surface, the technical difficulties involved in combining the three 1.

Although other types of tables are documented, the three-legged one was most popular. For the rabbinic evidence, see Johann Krengel, Das Hausgerdt in der Miina (Frankfurt, 1899), p. 1; Samuel Krauss, Qadmoniyyot ha-talmud, 4 vols. (Berlin-Vienna, 1922?-Tel Aviv, 1945), vol. 2, pt. I, p. 11. Over ten tables of this type have been discovered in Turkey and were described by Rodney S. Young, "Phrygian Furniture from Gordion," Expedi- tion 16 (1974): 3-12. 211</page><page sequence="2">212 JOSEPH TABORY legs with a four-cornered table top are so great3 that it does not seem likely that such a table could have developed independently in different cultures. The presence of such tables both in Greece and in Palestine indicates a link between the two cultures. It has been suggested, in connection with the Greek tables, that "the form may have been derived from Egypt"4 so that the link between Palestine and Greece may have been an indirect one, both depending on a common source. The second characteristic is that, like Greco-Roman tables, the tables referred to in rabbinic literature are considered portable, mobile objects. This is evidenced by the text in Sifra which says that laws of impurity do not apply to stationary objects but do apply to tables.5 This shows not only that the tables were potentially portable but that they were actually carried around during their use. Indeed, Resh Lakish (Palestine, 3rd century) said that the shewbread table used in the Temple would have been treated as a stationary object but for the fact that it was actually raised up and displayed to the pilgrims during festivals.6 Babylonian sources refer to the bringing in of the table at the beginning of the meal7 and to its removal at the end of the meal.8 Although this custom is well attested to in Greek and Roman sources,9 I have been unable to find similar attestation in Palestinian sources. 10 The above mentioned similarities seem to justify an attempt to shed additional light on the table in the Greco-Roman world through the use of rabbinic texts. The rabbinic sources refer frequently to a table equipped with 3. See the architectural monstrosity shown in Young, "Phrygian Furniture," fig. 3.

Young suggests that woodworking techniques throughout the Eastern Mediterrranean may have been borrowed from Egypt (Phrygian Furniture, p. 2). 5. Sifra, Shemini, Parashah 6, 4, ed.

Samuel Krauss, Talmudische Archdologie, 3 vols. (Leipzig, 1910-1912), 3: 55-56. Although the phrase found in the Mishna "they brought before him" (Pes. 10:3) has been explained as referring to the carrying in of a table (Rabbenu Hananel and Tosafot, both printed in B. T. Pesabim [Vilna, 1886] 114a), we cannot extract more from this passage than that the food was carried in. See the discussion of this passage in Joseph Tabory, "The History of the Order of the Passover Eve" [Hebrew], Ph.D. diss., Bar-Ilan University, 1977, p.15.</page><page sequence="3">THE HOUSEHOLD TABLE IN RABBINIC PALESTINE 213 a detachable top, evidence of which is hardly to be found in extant Greco- Roman sources, whether literary or archaeological." We must distinguish here between tables which are made of two parts, a top or leaf and a base, and tables whose tops are meant to be used independently. Marble or stone tables were well known in the Roman world and they were made in two separate parts: a top and a pedestal or two supports instead of the pedestal. However, once the top was placed on the support, it was meant to be a per- manent fixture there, since the great weight of the top would not permit its being carried around at will. Tables of this type were known in Palestine, and a fine example, found in the excavations of the Jewish Quarter of Jeru- salem, is on display at the Israel Museum.12 However, rabbinic sources refer to a table top made of a lighter material which was separate from its support and was used independently. The existence of such a top is shown in rab- binic sources by the remarkable law that both an ordinary or Delphic table from which one or two legs have completely broken off is not considered a utensil as regards the laws of purity, yet if the third leg has also broken off, it 11. In the article "mensa" in Pauly-Wissowa, Realenzyklopddie der klassischen Altertums Wissenschaft (Leipzig, 1893) (henceforth: PWRE), two proofs are brought to show the exis- tence of detachable table tops. The first proof is a deduction based on the fact that Penelope's suitors used tabletops as shields. Presumably they could not have done so if they had to manage with the legs of the table. However, a fifth century B.C.E. painter found no such difficulty, nor was he aware of detachable tabletops, since he portrayed a suitor holding a table as a shield with the legs of the table facing toward him (Ernst Pfuhl, Masterpieces of Greek Drawing and Painting [London, 1955], fig. 99). The second proof derives from Athenaeus's calling a tabletop hrid9rqa (Deipnosophistae 2. 49a). However, this would seem to refer to the manner of construction rather than the actual detachability of the top since the capital of a column is also called drid~Ea, even though no one would consider it detachable. Hugo Blumner ("Tische" in August Baumeister, Denkmaler des klassischen Altertums [Munich and Leipzig, 1899]) finds no evidence for detachable tabletops nor does G. M. A. Richter refer to them in her above-mentioned work. Interestingly enough, Young points out that, in the elaborate Phrygian table, "quite a lot of strong glue must have been used" to connect the table top to the legs for "otherwise the tops would have simply lifted off' (Phrygian Furniture, p. 7). Perhaps the tops were meant to be used separately. They were slightly dished at the surface, leaving a low raised rim all around the edges (Young, p. 5) which may imply that they were carried in fully laden. 12. See the description in Nahman Avigad, Archaeological Discoveries in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Catalogue no. 144, Spring 1976, p. 19. A photograph is to be found among the unnumbered plates and this photograph has also been reproduced in Qadmoniot 5 (1972): 98. A smaller, round table is on display in the Museum but no photograph of it has yet been published. Another table top of this period, at present in Haifa, has been described by Levi Y. Rahmani, "Table-top of the Late Second Temple Period," Sefunim 5 (1976): 67-71. However, from the carving on the ledge, it would seem that its support was a one- legged pedestal.</page><page sequence="4">214 JOSEPH TARORY may once again be considered as a utensil.'3 This is understandable only if we assume that a table from which all legs have broken off, i.e., a table top, may be placed on an independent tripod which was originally intended for supporting tabletops. The independent tabletop was called a tavla'4 and was frequently made of ceramics, although other materials, such as wood or even gold and silver, were also used.'5 From a Palestinian source, which has been preserved only in the Babylonian Talmud, we learn that tables were equipped with a ring attached to one edge'6 which was presumably used to hang the table on the wall when it was not in use." Since we can not consider the feasibility of hanging the table on the wall with its protruding legs, we must assume that here also they are speaking about a table top without legs. Vase paintings show fully laden tables being carried into the dining room.'8 Thus it is only natural to assume that the tabletops were used in the same way. The Mish- nah forbids carrying food to the home of a mourner on a tavla but permits the use of a basket'-'-apparently because bringing in the setting on a tavla was the more festive way of doing things. The tavla was equipped with a ledge20 which was needed to keep the dishes from sliding off during trans- port.21 13. M. Kelim 22:2.

(Leiden, 1974-1977), 2: 201. The base of the Delphic table was also considered a separate utensil (M. Kelim 24:6) and it is depicted as being used sepa- rately (P.T. Shabbat, 17:1, ed. Venice, 1523?, fol. 16b). 14. From rcTPXa (tray?) or tabula. See Krauss, Lehnw6rter, p. 254. 15. Yehoshua Brand, Kelei ha-heres be-sifrut ha-talmud (Jerusalem, 1953), p. 181. 16. B.T.

This is of special interest because Richter (Furniture, p. 78) points out that objects of everyday use, when put away, are represented on vase paintings as hanging on the wall. However, there is no such simi- lar evidence for tables. Richter (p. 63) suggests that Greek tables were pushed under the couches when not in use. 18.

It is possible that the surface of the tavla was carved (into sections?) or roughened for this same purpose. This would explain why a tavla whose upper surface was carved or rough- ened was considered a utensil while a table, whose highly polished surface was greatly esteemed (PWRE, s.v. "mensa," col. 939), would be ruined by the same treatment (T. Kelim, Bava Batra 1:9, ed. Moses Zuckermandel, p. 591). However, the meaning of this text is not sufficiently clear.

It should be pointed out that Syriac mlne has also the meanings of mensa and patella hostiarum (Karl Brockelmann, Lexicon Syriacum [Halle, 19281, p. 618b). Perhaps a careful study of the Syriac texts could shed additional light on the change and its causes.</page></plain_text>
