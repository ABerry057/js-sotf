Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992. viii, 434 pp. Jerome Mintz's Hassidic People: A Place in the New World presents, without bias or nostalgia, an unusually vivid and insightful portrait of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 293 American Hasidim. It is not a deep or introspective work-the book offers little analysis of Hasidic culture or philosophy-but rather, a highly informative narrative describing the personalities, events, and issues shaping contemporary Hasidic life in the United States. The author is particularly sensitive to the wide variety of Hasidic sects and subgroups and avoids the conventional error of treating America's Hasidim as an undifferentiated group. The two major sects, Satmar and Lubavitch, get extensive coverage but the book also includes wonderful reports on lesser-known groups like the Boyaner and Squarer Hasidim. Particularly helpful to students of Hasidism is the section on the Melochim sect, an authentically American Hasidic group established during the 1930s and 1940s, which despite its small numbers still manages to exert ideological pressure on the larger mainstream groups. This book helps dispel several myths about contemporary Hasidism. From the outside, Hasidim appear to be a monolithic group who live entirely apart from mainstream culture and center their existence around religious law, duty, and ritual. And while this is not entirely untrue, Mintz shows just how thoroughly American and worldy Hasidim have become in their struggles for what they consider their rights and privileges in the maelstrom of American ethnic politics. In the chapter entitled "The Housing Labyrinth in Williamsburg," the author details the astute political organization and clout of the Satmars in their successful attempt to have themselves declared a "minority group" and, in this way, become the recipients of special housing and employment grants. The book also explains the ongoing conflicts between Hasidim and Hispanics and Blacks as a function of ethnic competition for limited housing and governmental aid. The Hasidic family, too, is confronted by the dilemmas of modern culture. Although still very different-marriages are arranged and couples generally live in close proximity to parents-Mintz reports growing dis- enchantment with traditional notions of male authority as Hasidic women seek greater personal autonomy and self-fulfillment. Mintz reports about women who are "miserable" because they are forced to wear a wig, who resent the fact that Hasidic culture defines them exclusively as mothers and homemakers, and about others who refuse to accept the prohibition on secular literature, movies, and the arts. The chapters on the history of conflict-occasionally violent-between</page><page sequence="3">294 BOOK REVIEWS Lubavitcher and Satmar Hasidim are particularly illuminating for those interested in sectarian religious strife because Mintz presents the issues through the words of the protagonists themselves. Here we see how each of the groups views itself as the defender of "true Hasidism" against the contaminating influences of its sectarian competition. Mintz's data suggest that it may well be less theological differences than competition for followers and status that is at the heart of the controversy. Hasidic People is an appealing book with a great deal of "insider" information and careful attention to detail. But its simplicity and abundance of detail, without any theological framework within which to interpret the data, leave the reader with lots of interesting but unrelated information. No attempt of any depth is ever made to relate the social and cultural patterns of Hasidic life to the kabbalistic underpinings of Hasidic theology. To penetrate the Hasidic world, we need to know not only how they interact in everyday life but their otherworldly goals for self- and world transformation. When all is said and done, an eschatology of rebirth in 'olam ha-ba', the world-to-come, is at the center of Hasidic belief and culture, and it is this faith which binds Hasidic religiosity, culture, and rabbinical authority together. To a social scientist, this book is somewhat problematic on theoretical grounds. Although written by an anthropologist, Hasidic Life offers no analysis as to how Hasidic society is maintained in the antagonistic setting of American secularity. Some discussion of childhood socialization and social-boundary maintenance would help explain how conformity to Hasidic norms is maintained. A wonderful part of this book is its extensive use of quotations from the author's interviews with Hasidim. This material gives us a real sense of the concerns and issues facing Hasidim in America, but we never learn how representative the comments are. For example, just how widespread are family problems, and how serious an issue is defection? The author quotes several respondents to show that these are issues, but we are never shown additional data to demonstrate whether the respondents are typical of the norm or merely represent deviant cases. In spite of these reservations, Hasidic Life is an important and useful book. Anyone wanting to know about life in the American Hasidic community will have to refer to it.
