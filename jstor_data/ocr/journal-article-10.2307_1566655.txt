<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Nehama Aschkenasy. Woman at the Window: Biblical Tales of Oppression and Escape. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. 181 pp. Alice Bach. Women, Seduction and Betrayal in Biblical Narrative. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. xiv, 296 pp. Alice Bach's book combines literary criticism, cultural criticism, psychoanalysis, and feminist theory in its analysis of biblical seductresses. Both the "good" seductresses-Jael, Judith, and Esther-and the "bad" ones-Potiphar's wife, Delilah, and Salome--use sexuality and food to seduce their male victims, whom they eventually kill. The analysis of this figuration includes both biblical and Jewish Hellenistic texts, as well as European literary and American cinematographic interpretations. To extricate the woman from the patriarchal text, Bach draws on reader-response theory, arguing for an understanding of the role the individual reader plays in the construction of the biblical seductress. The first two chapters, "Signs of the Flesh" and "Contending with the Narrator," delineate the book's theoretical and methodological approaches. The first chapter argues for an inclusive approach to biblical women, one that crosses textual and canonical boundaries to include both the original biblical presentation and various interpretive representations both ancient and modem. It also argues against the application of a single method or the attempt to unify methods within any given discipline. Chapter 2 discusses the authoritative narrator of the biblical tale, and the role of the suspicious reader who questions the presuppositions and ideologies of the narrator. Rejecting the unified readings of Robert Alter and Meir Sternberg, Bach argues for a shift of emphasis from the male narrator to the female reader. This shift reveals that the construct of the "good woman" reflects the preferences of the male narrator rather than an objective moral desideratum. The "good woman" is passive and silent, whereas the "strange woman" (ishah zarah) is active, talkative, and sexually desirable. Chapter 3, "A Story of Reading the Story of Genesis 39," delineates the framework of this biblical chapter as being about men, success, position, and 97</page><page sequence="2">98 BOOK REVIEWS power. Potiphar's wife, who opens her house up to Joseph and who opens her mouth, upsets the framework of the social order. Following Mieke Bal and Thomas Mann, Bach names this anonymous seductress Mut-em-enet and compares her to two "good" seductresses, Judah's daughter-in-law in Genesis 38 and Susanna, both of whom are vindicated and valorized at the end of their respective ordeals. Chapter 4 proceeds to emphasize the generic conventions and moralistic agenda of Jewish Hellenistic retellings of the Joseph story, which are mostly concerned with the hero's struggle with good and evil. Thus, the Testament ofJoseph presents the hero as the embodiment of righteousness and perfection, the hero who does not succumb to sexual passion and the threat of adultery. Joseph's endurance is a model of what the Jewish community must undergo under Greek domination. In Joseph and Asenath the character of Joseph is even more idealized in terms of his moral stature, while Asenath, who loves him, is valorized as a beautiful, chaste virgin. In this romance, the seductress is not even mentioned. Bach exposes and challenges the suppression or embedding of the seductress in both the biblical and the postbiblical narratives: "The embedded woman appears when the reader resists the writer's view that Mut-em-enet behaves 'just like a woman"'(p. 127). Chapter 5, "Signs of Her Flesh," deals with the status of the seductress as the silent object of the male gaze. Using art and film theory, Bach analyzes the ways in which the biblical texts and subsequent paintings reproduce David's defining gaze at Bathsheba, who is a mute object of desire. The implicit rape of Bathsheba is compared with the explicit rape of Tamar; both are perceived as seductresses by their desirous male counterparts, David and Amnon. Chapter 6, "Wine, Women and Death," argues that the pleasures of the female body and woman's offer of food are interpreted in the Bible as negative signs. Both Esther and Judith use food and sexual desire to entrap mighty men. These women are "good" because they are either virgins (Esther) or sexually abstinent (Judith). Unlike Delilah and Salome, the "bad" seductresses, at the end of the story they are re-enclosed within the patriarchal system, accepting obediently their status as dependent and secluded women. Chapter 7, "Calling the Shots," focuses on modem representations of Salome, the New Testament seductress and the killer of John the Baptist, in literature (Mallarm6, Oscar Wilde, Flaubert), opera (Richard Strauss), art, and film. The obsession with Salome, the beautiful and independent woman, suggests that the characterization of Salome asfemmefatale is a symptom of male fears of women and feminism.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 99 Women, Seduction and Betrayal in Biblical Narrative extends the boundaries of feminist biblical criticism by suggesting that postbiblical representations and reinterpretations, from Hellenistic text to Hollywood films, can and should be understood as biblical narratives on a par with the original text. Bach's resisting reading of the biblical narrative is nuanced and complex, her critique of traditional biblical scholarship is unstinting, and her interpretations suggestive and creative. Nehama Aschkenasy's book offers a literary exploration of female-centered episodes focusing on the image of woman at the window, in the doorway, or on the road. As much as these images suggest patriarchal enclosure and oppression, there are also successful attempts at escape, whether social, symbolic, or linguistic. Aschkenasy sets out to highlight "the nuances of style" and the narrative aspects that "make the biblical tale a classic artistic-endeavor" (p. 10). She explains in the introduction that women are often enclosed in a biological cycle of immanence that resembles the pagan worldview of human fate, a principle symbolized in the image of the woman waiting by the window, imprisoned as it were and separated from the world of men. She understands this enclosure to be a part of the cultural and historical context of the biblical text that offers possibilities of escape from patriarchal constriction. She argues that the biblical text includes heterogeneous ideologies, multiple authorial voices, and counterculture attitudes. Chapter 1, "Woman at the Window," discusses Sisera's mother, Yael [sic] the Kenite, Deborah the prophetess, and Michal, David's wife. While Sisera's mother reinforces the image of the passive and dependent lethal woman, Yael is described as a courageous warrior who manages to transcend her enclosure behind the door of the tent. In her ode, Deborah condemns women's subordination and praises their might. Michal uses the window as an exit from oppression as she resists her father and helps David escape, though the window will reappear in the description of the decline of the couple's relationship. Chapter 2, "Woman on the Road: The Hazards of the Open Space," deals with the rape of Dinah and the "hapless concubine." Teasing out the possible implications of Dinah's status as the daughter of the neglected and unfavored wife Leah, and of the concubine's status as an embittered young woman whose husband refuses to make her a wife, Aschkenasy elaborates various psychological reasons for the women's venturing out beyond their assigned boundaries. She reads the bitter end of both women, Dinah's rape and reenclosure,</page><page sequence="4">100 BOOK REVIEWS the concubine's gang rape and murder, as a cultural indictment of women's daring to leave their proper places. The narrator in these tales merely transmits the values of his culture, reflecting at the same time the violence that was visited on women both inside and outside the home. Chapter 3, "Woman Ventures Out: Mobility and Its Benefits," discusses Tamar, Judah's daughter-in-law, David's wife Abigail, and the "wise woman on the wall" (2 Sam 20:13-22). In contrast to the preceding chapter, these cases exemplify positive evaluations of women's risk-taking enterprises. Tamar demonstrates "psychological and mental maturity" and highlights Judah's behavior as deceitful and ruthless (p. 90). Her successful attempt to give birth to Judah's sons secures her a place in history and helps her break out of the biological enclosure. Similarly, Abigail represents the golden mean between the impetuosity of David and the boorishness of her first husband, Nabal. Her gift for rational persuasion marks her venturing outside the preserve of her assigned place as a successful escape form biological determinism. The "wise woman" who convinces David's officer, Joab, to spare the city of Tebets Abel of Beth-maacah also steps out of the bounds of the feminine enclosure by using diplomacy and a sophisticated style of negotiation. Chapter 4, "Woman Behind the Scenes," deals with Rebecca's attempt to secure a blessing for Jacob and with Bathsheba's attempt to secure the throne for Solomon. Rebecca emerges as "myopic and paranoid" (p. 105) in contrast to the discerning, albeit blind, Isaac. In this incident the biblical narrator suggests that Rebecca's resorting to wiles and trickery ends up complicating her own and Jacob's lives. The opposite message is conveyed by the story of Bathsheba, who appears to be passive, insecure, and dominated by men like Adonijah and Nathan the prophet. Aschkenasy suggests that Bathsheba, far from being a puppet, manipulates events to coincide with her plans and desires, getting rid of her son's competitor, mobilizing the prophet to speak on her behalf, and securing her son's throne and her own status as queen mother. Chapter 5, "In the Palace of Words," argues that women's discourse often helps them escape their cultural and historical enclosure. The chapter looks at the oratory of Eve, the primeval woman, which reflects the power to reason, analyze, describe inner states, and create new concepts. Eve's language is more sophisticated than Adam's. The five daughters of Zelophehad also use a combination of humble posturing and daring ideas as they challenge the patriarchal rule of inheritance.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 101 Hannah's prayer reveals a combination of humility and tenacity as she frames her request for a son within the framework of a vow to offer him up to God. Hannah's discourse reveals a spiritual grandeur that transcends the limited role of women in her cultural context. The final case, Ruth, exemplifies a lofty metaphorical rhetoric of respectability and honor as she rises from rags to riches. In the epilogue Aschkenasy insists on the possibility that the biblical text includes both tales of oppression and of escape, and that it is patriarchal as well as anti- or non-patriarchal. "Reading the ancient tales is an act of dramatic participation and reciprocal understanding. We bring to them our own perspectives, decoding and illuminating in their narrative fabric those areas that may have gone unnoticed by ancient readers" (p. 157). It is precisely at this point that Aschkenasy differs from Bach. The reader- response theory that Bach uses as a method of extricating the woman from the patriarchal text leaves no possibility for reconciliation between the patriarchal narrator and the woman reader. Aschkenasy finds in the text itself expressions of women's perspectives that contradict the generally patriarchal framework of the tales. The theoretical difference between Bach and Aschkenasy results in vastly different readings of female-centered stories, notably of seductresses, whom Bach reads as manifestations of male desire and fear, and Aschkenasy as manifestations of female wisdom and strength. Bach offers a powerful cultural critique, while Aschkenasy validates biblical tales about women as artistic triumphs. In many ways these books rehearse an ongoing debate between critics and deconstructionists even as they extend the parameters of the debate. The questions both works raise are important, and must be dealt with by subsequent studies of biblical women and feminist approaches to the Hebrew Bible.
