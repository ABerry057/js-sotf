<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark R. Cohen. Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. xxi, 280 pp. In the last generation a somewhat strange argument has developed among Jews (primarily in Israel) that has translated into a propaganda weapon and an intellectual problem. It revolves around the question whether Jews suffered or flourished more under medieval Christians or Muslims. The debate involves Ashkenazi survivors of the Holocaust, proud.Sephardim who were among the staunchest Zionists even if they did not succeed to political power, and Oriental Jews who were absorbed into the State of Israel after its creation; and although it reflects a contemporary reaction to the "other" in power, it is principally based on the infelicitous comparisons introduced by nineteenth-century German Jewish scholars to promote their own apology for emancipation (pace Ismar Schorsch). In a way, this argument is a contem- poraneously generated response to the reawakening of the "Sephardim" in Israel (the latter term being a misnomer that deserves its own essay) during the 1980s. What Mark Cohen has done with this book is to raise the level of the debate to that of scholarly inquiry. Once the reason for the inquiry has been cogently stated, the question</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 397 arises: can it be done? Is this not a case of comparing apples and oranges, a comparison whose bitter fruit has been allowed to putrefy polemically and apologetically in the wake of the most recent demographic disaster to smite the Jewish people? Only rarely does one see comparative studies of this kind carried out satisfactorily. One successful example is Jonathan Steinberg's All Or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust, 1941-1943 (London, 1990), where he asks why the Italian army protected Jews, whereas the German army assisted the process and even destroyed Jews in the same occupied areas. His investigation leads to a deep and fascinating historical analysis of the respective social characters of both societies. Similarly, Shlomo Shoham, in his forthcoming Valhalla, Auschwitz, and Calvary, contrasts the polar opposites of the German and Jewish social characteristics from a variety of disciplines to explain the inevitability and uniqueness of the Holocaust. These two books, then, can be used as models for the study of the effect opposite social characteristics have on the functioning of analogous institutions in similar historical situations. Cohen courageously makes an attempt to compare how people with the same religious and cultural legacies fared under different civilizations. He divides his inquiry into five topics. In the first part he offers a statement of the myth and countermyth that necessitate the study. Here he accumulates a broad stream of literature that indicates how far the problem has permeated contemporary society. This is most valuable to the reader who is unaware of the dimensions of the question. It is very like the Khazar-Ashkenazi argument originally proposed by Jews that later became a fickle finger of Soviet and Arab propaganda, or even like the vicissitudes surrounding the Elders of Zion phenomenon. Most recently the polemic has been extended by Ammiel Alcalay in his vitriolic yet stimulating After Jews and Arabs: Remaking Levantine Culture (Minneapolis, 1993). Part 2 is a survey of the religious disputes among the three monotheistic religions and, after the respective conquests, the legal status of the Jews in different orbits (although it ignores Zvi Ankori's thesis that the Carolingian charters reflect Jewish concerns which were negotiated into the structure of the charters). Parts 3 and 4 deal with economic and social phenomena, i.e., how the systems worked in practice, while Part 5 summarizes polemics and persecutions, namely, how each group (Jews vs. Christians and Jews vs. Muslims) developed a fighting spirit, the "bully-victim" fights, and the respective memories of those involved. This book is a first effort at a difficult task, as the author correctly admits. Where it succeeds is in forcing specialists in one area of the Middle Ages to</page><page sequence="3">398 BOOK REVIEWS confront another area with which, more likely than not, they are unfamiliar, let alone competent. Thus, for its surveys and bibliographical critiques, Cohen's essay will be of significant use to teachers and students struggling to make some sense out of the cosmopolitan range of medieval Jewish studies whose prior "master narratives" are being challenged by a younger generation of deconstructionists. In addition, the intermix of contemporary medieval sources with the author's commentary brings alive for the reader a sense of the medieval Jewish dilemma: how to live as a tolerated yet despised minority. On a broader note the author has introduced into his narrative a "new" sociological approach that has long been familiar to students of other medieval histories. The jargon is that of multiculturalism, or an Americanization of the French Annales school, now tending to lose its appeal in general medieval studies (pace Norman Cantor's Inventing The Middle Ages). Cohen deftly weaves this new (i.e., Englished) language of marginality and hierarchy into the older concepts of alienness and feudalism. Again students will be grateful for the hard-earned, well-explicated, self-taught lessons he offers in this area. He reads deeply and well, and his sharing is welcome. It is perhaps time to ask whether there was one medieval Jewish history or many, and, if there was one, whether it can be written independently of the general framework of a Middle Ages dating from ca. 300-1500. The Roman Empire and its attendant civilization was divided, like Gaul, among three heirs: a rural Germanic Latin Christian west, a polyethnic urban Greek Orthodox east, and a cosmopolitan Arabic Muslim south. To understand the vicissitudes of the Jews in the Middle Ages (however defined), one has to understand the legacies of the three heirs (Byzantium is noticeably absent from the book), and only then can comparisons and value judgments be usefully made about the powerless Jews who influenced power. What relationship, if any, did the Byzantine persecutions of the seventh to tenth centuries have on the west from the tenth to thirteenth centuries? Why was the Orthodox Greek Church's attitude opposite to that of the Latin Church with respect to baptism, forced conversion, and the use of apostates to challenge professing Jews? Can the Islamic Jewish revolts of the seventh to eighth centuries be usefully compared with the situation in the west? What of the Spains: Visigothic, Islamic, the Reconquista kingdoms, and the denouement attending unification? To what can the millennium of Spain be compared, or must it be dissected for synchronic comparison with the eastern marches of Arab Islam in southern Russia or Persia? There are other problems that arise from a comparison of disparate topics.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 399 Already in his chapter comparing the attitudes of Christianity and Islam toward Judaism, the problem of chronological symmetry manifests itself. In earlier publications Cohen restricted his inquiry to the Islamic society of the Geniza world, in which he is eminently at home, and to the northern Christian lands of Crusader Ashkenazi society. While he bows to the more tolerant Christian societies, e.g., Poland, Spain, Italy, one looks in vain for Byzantium, where there were far more Jews than ever were in the lands of medieval Ashkenaz. Here a synchronic study would show how contemporary contending religious states (the empire and the caliphate) forced attitudes toward the Jews that were similarly religiously but opposed politically. In Cohen's construct, however, the diachronic differences raise serious questions about the efficacy of comparing such disparate phenomena as fourth-century Christians in vituperative competition with Judaism and fourteenth-century Muslims who were in power and comfortably possessive of "the truth"; hence, the latter were contemptuously tolerant of both Jews and Christians. In general the argument would have been strengthened if the persecutions in west and east had been periodized, placed in context, and then compared (e.g., eleventh- and twelfth-century Muslim Spain and the Crusades in western Europe and the Levant). There seems also to be a hint of apology about the treatment of Jews under Islam that is totally lacking in the descriptions of the Jews in the west. Recourse to the Byzantine center would highlight other perspectives on the Jewish situation and provide links for more fruitful comparisons. Islam inherited Roman Jewry law (pertaining to synagogue construction and many other disabilities) and martyrdom from Byzantium, as well as its early coinage and classical wisdom. Byzantium continued to influence the Islamic world, especially through the medium of the Turkic leaders who ultimately forged the Ottoman sultanate. Byzantium, in western eyes, was the imperium, both among the Central European Salian emperors and the Hebrew author of Sepher Yosippon (the latter much more influential than Cohen suggests). On certain points the author is ambiguous: was it Umar I or Umar II to whom the notorious Pact of Omar should be attributed? In another vein: the legal systems of western European church and state deserve a fuller treatment in regard to their mutual relationships vis-a-vis the Jews, if not in general. Other subjects are lacking: the question of women in the Jewish world and a comparison of the effects of the local majority culture upon their situation; the lack of thirteenth-century persecutions in the era of Mongol expansion (the latter were seen in the west as the avenging Ten Lost Tribes) compared to the</page><page sequence="5">400 BOOK REVIEWS twelfth and fourteenth centuries; the Davidic exilarchy and the reception of Jewish power by Muslims compared to the fear of Jewish power by western churchmen (Agobard should be read through the filter of his hyperbole rather than literally). These questions aside, the author has shown us that putting old wine in new bottles does not give a satisfactory overall picture of the period after Rome/New Rome and until the Expulsion. For that we should be grateful. Now perhaps we can move on to a new conceptualization of the whole period, one that looks at the Middle Ages from the totality of its experiences and at the Jewish role within those worlds as distinct from our contemporary projections.
