<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURY VENICE: REALITY OR CONJECTURE? by BENJAMIN RAVID Brandeis University It has hitherto been generally accepted that the Jews played an active part in the overseas commerce of Venice during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,' that they were present in the city not only as transients but also as residents, and that they were even confined to a special area.2 However, a closer investigation reveals that this view constitutes a highly questionable reconstruction of the course of events, based simultaneously on the clear 1.

Specifically, the accepted view rests on three allegations. First, a census of the year 1152 purportedly indicated that 1,300 Jews then resided in Venice.3 Second, in 1290, a tax of 5 percent was supposedly imposed on all imports and exports of the Jews to and from Venice.4 Third, the place name Giudecca (in Venetian dialect sometimes rendered as Zuecca, Zudecca, or Zudega) given to the Venetian island previously called Spinalunga most probably derived from the Latin word Judaica-in Italian: Giudaica-as a consequence of the residence of the Jews on the island.5 However, an ex- amination of the sources reveals that the first two allegations are invalid and cannot be used to support either the claim that the Jews resided in the city of Venice or that they engaged in commerce in it, while the third is highly con- jectural. I THE CENSUS OF 1152 The information that according to a census of May 12, 1152, 1,300 Jews resided in Venice was first made available in print in the eight volume major opus of the eighteenth century Venetian antiquarian, G. B. Gallicciolli, en- titled Delle memorie venete antiche profane ed ecclesiastiche, published in Venice in 1795. The information on the Jews contained in this work has served either directly or indirectly as the main source of data for virtually all subsequent writers on the Jews of Venice.6 Gallicciolli himself relied heavily on a history of the Jews of Venice, written, in his words, "not long ago" by Pietro Vanzi, and possibly drew his information on the census of 1152 from that source, still unpublished today. Regarding that census, Gallicciolli sug- gested that "there is an error in the date, perhaps caused by the transcriber of the Chronicle, and that the figures pertain to later centuries," since the 3.

For Gallicciolli's material on the Jews, see 2:278-326 (secs. 872-990); on the census of 1290, 2:278-79 (secs. 874-75) (quoted in the next note).</page><page sequence="3">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 203 number of friars given in that census was too high, and also "such a large number of Jews was not probable at that time."7 Subsequent scholars, however, without any explanation or justification, reversed Gallicciolli's reservations, and, on the contrary, accepting the date of 1152, whose validity he had questioned, chose rather to doubt the figure of 1,300 Jews.s 7. The account in Gallicciolli reads as follows (2:278-79 [secs. 874-75]): Che antichissimi per tanto siano gli Ebrei in Venezia consta da irrefragabili documenti, che in seguito produrremo. In una Cronaca dello Svajer altrove citata por- tasi il censo di Venezia, che dicesi fatto nel 1152, 12 Maggio, e vi si notano: Uomini 48333 Donne 55412 Putti 49923 Frati 2682 Monache 2558 Giudei 1300 160208 Ma io veramente temo, che siavi errore nella data, forse provenuto da chi trascrisse quella Cronaca, e che questa numerazione a pi6 bassi secoli appartenga, vedendovisi troppo grande numero di Frati, e sapendosi altronde, che tanto grande numero di Ebrei in quel tempo non era probabile. For Gallicciolli's reference to the chronicle of Vanzi, which he calls "le pia copiose Storiche Memorie della Giudaica gente in Venezia... un esemplare di cui trovavasi nei Mss. raccolti dallo Svager," among which, Gallicciolli related, were also other manuscripts containing much information on the Jews, all of which he utilized, see Memorie venete, 2:280 (sec. 878). Ac- cording to Samuele Romanin, Storia documentata di Venezia, 10 vols. (Venice, 1853-61), 2:378, Vanzi's work was entitled "Memoria sulla Ricondotta degli Ebreo nello Stato Veneto 1767." I have located, through the microfilm collection of the Historical Society of Israel in Jerusalem, a version of Vanzi's manuscript in the Museo Civico Correr, Venice, MS Cicogna 2380. It was apparently entitled "Memorie istoriche relative alla ricondotta delli Giudei nello stato della Serma Republica di Venezia." However, both the microfilmed text in Jerusalem and the text which I have obtained from the Museo Civico Correr, through the kind efforts of Signorina Lina Frizziero of Venice, are incomplete and do not contain the census figures. Pos- sibly they were drawn from another manuscript in the Svajer collection and not from Vanzi. 8. The population figures and dates presented by Gallicciolli were accepted unquestioning- ly by Giuseppe Cappelletti, Storia della repubblica di Venezia dal suo principio sino al giorno d'oggi, 13 vols. (Venice, 1850-1855), 10:120 (with a footnote reference to Gallicciolli), and by Schiavi, "Gli Ebrei," p. 311 with a footnote reference to Cappelletti. Pompeo Molmenti took the information from Schiavi, and acknowledging Schiavi, incorporated the data into his wide- ly read and translated La storia di Venezia nella vita privata dalle origine alla caduta della repub- blica (many editions; see the seventh, 3 vols. [Bergamo, 1927-29], 1:78-79), thereby extensively disseminating the misinformation among many readers unlikely to read any book or article on the Jews. On the other hand, Ricardo Rocca, "Cenni sulla communiti israelitica di Venezia," Annali di Statistica, 3d ser. 9 (1884): 168, without giving a source, wrote that a manuscript in the Svajer collection referred to a census professing to have been taken on May 12, 1152, which recorded that the population of 160,208 inhabitants included 1,300 Jews; however, he noted,</page><page sequence="4">204 BENJAMIN RAVID In actuality, an examination of the available statistics on the Jewish popula- tion of Venice seems to support Gallicciolli's contention that the date of 1152 was incorrect, and it appears more probable that the census cited by Gallicciolli should be ascribed to approximately 1555.9 some maintained that the figures came from a later date, and that in 1152 the Jews were not so numerous. Roth in his Venice, p. 9, considered this figure to be "possibly an exaggeration, but a clear proof nevertheless that they must already have formed an important nucleus." In his later History of the Jews of Italy (Philadelphia, 1946), p. 76, Roth was somewhat more critical: "There were probably a few immigrant traders at Venice, though a report which fixes their number in 1152 at 1,300 is almost certainly unauthentic." Milano, Storia, p. 71 wrote: "Tale cifra [1300], presumibilmente troppo alta, e tuttavia sin- tomo della importanza che l'elemento ebraico aveva gid cominciato ad assumere nella vita commerciale di Venezia"; cf. ibid., p. 105:". . . . la notizia alquanto dubbiosa .... " See also Milano's earlier "Gli Ebrei in Italia nei secoli XI e XII," La rassegna mensile di Israel 13 (1938): 25-26. The population estimate is mentioned by Baron, SRHJ, 4:25, where it is considered "almost certainly a gross exaggeration," and also 10:292 ("a gross exaggeration"). See also the Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Venice," with the comment "the figure is considered an extreme exaggeration." 9.

The closest approximation to the figures given by Gallicciolli is found in a census of 1555 (Contento, "I1 censimento," 19:37; Beloch, "Populazione," p. 10): Gallicciolli 1555 Men 48,333 48,333 Women 55,412 55,412 Children 49,923 49,923 Friars 2,682 2,688 Monks 2,558 2,588 Jews 1,300 923 160,208 159,867 I have so far been unable to find any census giving a Jewish population of 1,300 or a total population of 160,208.

He related that in a certain manuscript (presumably that of Vanzi) "there is to be found a decree of the Great Council (Maggior Con- siglio) from the year 1290, according to which the Jews were required to pay a 5 percent import and export tax on their merchandise." On the basis of this decree, Gallicciolli deduced that "for the longest time, the Jews had lived in our state, primarily in Venice, trading," although he inferred from the date of the decree that only in the thirteenth century, and perhaps only well into it, did Jewish commerce begin to become noticeable; previously, the Jews were not significant, either because of their small numbers, or because of the paltriness of their trade.'0 However, an examination of Venetian legislation reveals that Gallicciol- li, misled by his source, misinterpreted the nature of the edict of 1290. In reality, on July 27, 1290, the Great Council resolved that "all the Jews of Negroponte [modern Euboea in the Aegean sea] and all other places who sail by sea" were to be required to pay a 5 percent tax on all their imports and exports, as were those of Crete." That legislation did not mention the civilisation. 30 (1975): 1277-1302, which appeared after this article was submitted and accepted for publication. On p. 1296, n. 4, Mueller observed that the total population figure given by Gallicciolli for Venice was only reached in the sixteenth century and "Bien que Gallicciolli, p. 279, ait lui-meme note que ce chiffre 6tait sans doute posterieur et que la date transcrite 6tait probablement erronee, les historiens des juifs n'ont pas cess6 de l'attribuer au XIIe siecle. Cer- tains ont admis que le chiffre semblait exag6r6, tout en y voyant un bon indice de l'importance commerciale des juifs dans la Venise du XIIe siicle . . .") 10. Gallicciolli, Memorie venete, 2:279-80 (sec. 877): "E veramente bisogna riconoscere, che per tempissimo gli Ebrei nello Stato nostro, e in Venezia principalmente soggiornassero trafficando, mentre trovasi decreto, Ms. Svaj. del M.C. fino dal 1290, per cui gli Ebrei vengono astretti a pagar il 5 per 100 di entrata e uscita delle loro merci. Ma questo stesso Decreto, se male io non m'oppongo, ci fa ancora sentire, che solo nel Secolo XIII, e forse molto bene adulto, quella Nazione trafficante principiasse ad essere tra noi osservabile, mentre per lo in- nanzi o il poco numero, o la meschinith del loro mercimonio sembra che non rendesse gran fat- to riflessibili i Giudei." The text of the Vanzi manuscript related that "e di fatto del MCCXC ai 27 di luglio, si vede che questa Nazione con li veneti commerciava [footnote 18 of Vanzi: Parte del Maggior Consiglio], poiche si ordina, che gli Ebrei dovessero pagare il cinque per cento d'ingresso ed uscita di tutte le Mercanzie." 11.

III THE GIUDECCA PROBLEM Thus, two pieces of "empirical" evidence adduced to support the presence of the Jews in Venice and their commercial activities in the city during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries seem to be invalid. There remains the very complex problem of the place-name Giudecca-Zuecca and the argu- ment that the name is etymologically related to the Jews, from an Italian form Giudaica, with a Z replacing the Gi in Venetian dialect. It is, of course, well known that the term Giudecca was used to refer to Jewish quarters in Italy in the Middle Ages.12 Nevertheless, it is encumbent upon the historian to find evidence that specifically in the city of Venice, Jews lived on the island in question, originally called Spinalunga, and that the island received its new name as a consequence of their presence on it. The eighteenth century Italian antiquarian Lodovico Muratori asserted that the Giudecca of Venice was already mentioned in a document of 1090. Although subsequent eighteenth century authors pointed out that the reference was to a Giudecca in Constantinople, at least three twentieth cen- addatur in commissionibus Rectorum de Nigroponte quod debeant accipere dictum comer- cium ad intratam et exitum. Et si consilium est contra, sit revocatum quantum in hoc. Pars de XL." Subsequently, this tax was eliminated twenty-eight years later in 1318; see Freddy Thiriet, ed., Deliberations des assemblies vdnitiennes, 2 vols. (Paris, 1966-71), 1:175-76, (sec. 395): "Sur la demande pr6sent6e par les autorit6s locales, on accepte d'affranchir les Juifs de N6grepont de diverses obligations: entre autres, ils ne seront plus astreints A la taxe de 5% qu'ils devaient ac- quitter sur la valeur des marchandises qu'ils exportaient ou importaient par mer." ("Liber clericus-civicus," fols. 141r-141v, March 30, 1318). See also Joshua Starr, Romania: The Jewries of the Levant After the Fourth Crusade (Paris, 1949), p. 44, explaining that the elimination of the tax was a reward for the loyalty of the Jews in defending the town against the Catalans; however, two decades later, a 5 percent tax was im- posed on all goods imported and exported by Jews and other non-citizens in order to provide funds for heightening the wall around the Venetian compound. 12.

Lodovico Muratori, Dissertazione (Milan, 1751), p. 188: "Ne si vuol ommettere, che il Luogo, conceduto a i Giudei per loro abitazione nelle Citti, da noi ora appellato Ghetto, an- ticamente si chiamava Judaea, Judaica, Judaearia, etc. Di qua 6 nato il nome di Giudecca con- servato fin qui in Venezia, come anche in Ferrara, dove ha il nome di Zuecca. Di questi nomi s'ha riscontro in un Diploma di Ruggieri Duca di Puglia, Figlio di Roberto Guiscardo Duca, il quale nell'Anno 1090 dona all'Arcivescovo di Salerno totam Judaeani hujus nostrae Saler- nitanae Civitatis cum omnibus Judaeis, qui in hac eadem modo habitantes sunt, et fuerint etc con tutte le rendite, che si cavavano da quella gente. La Giudeca di Venezia si truova nominata in un Diploma di Vitale Faletro Doge di Venezia e Dalmazia nell'Anno 1090." The text of 1090 was published by Flaminio Cornaro, Ecclesiae Venetae antiquis monumentis, 18 vols. (Venice, 1749), 8:212-15. Tommaso Temanza, Antica pianta dell'inclita cittd di Venezia (Venice, 1781), p. 53, followed by Gallicciolli, Memorie venete, 1:116 (sec. 121), correctly observed that the reference was to the Giudecca of Constantinople, rather than to a Giudecca in Venice; see also Romanin, Storia documentata, 1:151. However, Roth, Italy, pp. 69-70 and Milano, Storia, pp. 71 and 85 accepted the passage as referring to Venice and used it as evidence of the early settlement of the Jews in the city. This view is also repeated in En- cyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Venice." Of course, the identification of the Giudecca with the later ghetto vecchio in Selig Cassell's article "Juden (Geschichte)" in Ersch and Gruber, Allgemeiner Encyklopedie der Wissenschaft und Kunst, 150 vols. (Leipzig, 1818-50) is erroneous. 14. The document was first partially quoted in Tommaso Temanza, Antica pianta, p. 56, where it was dated September 8, 1252. On the map itself, found by Temanza in a codex written by a Franciscan in the fourteenth century and published by Temanza as a "foldout" at the end of the book-and reproduced by Fabio Mutinelli, Del costume veneziano sino al decimo settimo secolo (Venice, 1831), p. 24--the island of Spinalunga is labelled Judaica. On the basis of the physical delineations and names on the map, Temanza believed that it dated from some time prior to 1141, and was found by the fourteenth century Franciscan who added some names on the map (including apparently the word Judaica) and then put the map with his other papers (pp. 52-55, esp. 53, note a). It should be pointed out that on the basis of the documents and dis- cussion on pp. 56ff., in the sentence on p. 53, ".. . questa porzione di Giudecca, la quale nel XII secolo Giudecca Nuova appellavasi non fu interrata, che poco dopo l'anno 1250," the "XII secolo" should read "XIII secolo." A briefer passage from the legislation was also quoted, from a work of Trevisano, by Gallic- ciolli, Memorie venete, 1:115 (sec. 121), and dated October 8, 1252. The date 1252 is also en- countered in Cappelletti, Storia, 9:122 (from Gallicciolli); Schiavi, "Gli Ebrei," p. 319; Roth, Venice, p. 9; Baron, SRHJ, 4:25; 10:292; Milano, Storia, p. 137; Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Venice." However, Romanin, Storia documentata, 2:379, n. 3, gave a date of September 8, 1254. (See now Giorgio Zordan, Le persone nella storia del diritto veneziano prestatutorio [Padua, 1973], p. 102, n. 27, for the assertion, apparently correct, that the date of the legislation should be September 23, 1254, on the basis of the text'in Cessi, Deliberazioni, 2:120.)</page><page sequence="8">208 BENJAMIN RAVID authors maintained that the term was derived from the presence of the Jews,"5 this etymology was already a subject of disagreement no later than the beginning of the seventeenth century. Francesco Sansovino, in the first edition of his very popular Venetia, citthi nobilissima et singolare (Venice, 1581) related that the island of Spinalunga came to be called Giudecca because the Jews first settled there when they came to Venice.'6 The second posthumous edition of the book (Venice, 1604), "with great diligence cor- rected, emended and augmented by over a third with new material" by Giovanni Stringa, dropped this explanation and added some new material. Stringa related that the island was first inhabited in 856, when the Bar- bolani, Scoli and Selvi, certain families who had been deprived of their lands and banished from Venice, were allowed to return as a result of the interven- tion of the Emperor Louis II (855-875) and given permission to build homes there."7 Interestingly, the third edition of Sansovino's book, edited by Giustiniano Martinioni (Venice, 1663), which added in italics after each entry additional material to bring the description up to date, restored the original reading of the first edition.'8 Shortly afterwards Vicenzo Coronelli 15. Cristoforo Tentori, in his Saggio sulla storia civile politica ecclesiastica e sulla corografia e topografia degli stati della repubblica di Venezia, 11 vols. (Venice, 1785-1790), 2:194, enumerated those authors who believed that the island of Spinalunga took on the name of Giudecca because it was first inhabited by Jews: Bernardo Giustiniano, Lorenzo de' Monacis, Marco Antonio Sabellico, Francesco Sansovino, P. Coronelli, Vettor Sandi and Filiasi in his Saggio sopra i primi Venetiani. Tentori, however, disagreed with their derivation (see below). 16. Ibid., fol. 90r: "L'Isola della Giudecca, chiamata prima Spinalonga, ma Giudecca poi, per la prima habitatione che vi fece la natione de Giudei quando venne a Venetia." Vanzi, in his unpublished chronicle, wrote that "io concorro col Sansovino [n. 17: Storia di Venezia] a credere che l'Isola di Spinalonga si chiamasse Giudecca, oggi volgarmente Zuecca, appunto perche cola stanziassero li Giudei sino da quando grandioso era lo traffico della Repubblica coll'Isola di Candia, luoco assegnato alla Nazione Giudaica, come a tant'altre in quella Citti, onde potesse aqartievava [marginal note: non ? voce di lingua] le proprie merci; e pretende l'Istorico sudetto che un tal nome riportasse [marginal note: cangia questa voce] sino dal MCC." For the continuation of the text of Vanzi, see the passage quoted in n. 10, above. 17. Ibid., fol. 182r. "L'Isola della Giudecca, chiamata giai Spinalunga; nella quale furono primi ad habitare l'anno 856 i Barbolani, i Scoli et i Selvi, Tribuni antichi, et che furono ban- diti, et confiscati i loro beni per certe discordie, c'hebbero con altre famiglie. Ma ritornati a casa ad instantia di Lodovico II Re de'Romani et non havendo case, fu concesso loro, che fabricassero nella Giudecca ... ." For further details on these alleged settlers on the Giudecca, see Romanin, Storia documentata, 1:181-82. 18. See p. 250. It should be noted that these changes in the entry "Spinalunga" necessitated also changes in the entry "ghetto." Sansovino had originally written in his text in the entry "ghetto": "Percioche essendo questa patria stanza frequentata da molte genti d'ogni lingua et paese, ci vennero anco gli Hebrei i quali la prima volta si misero in Spinalunga, che poi cam- biato nome, fu detta per lo nome loro Giudecca" (fol. 135v). Stringa,in accordance with his view on the derivation of Spinalunga, changed the sentence to read: "Percioche essendo questa Patria una stanza assai frequententa da molte genti di ogni lingua et paese, ci vennero anco gli Hebrei che habitavano per tutta la terra" (fol. 256v). Subsequently in his third edition, Mar-</page><page sequence="9">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 209 in his Isolario (Venice, 1696) incorporated both views into his account: the Barbolani, Scoli, and Selvi were the first to dwell on the island, which later tinioni restored the reading of the first edition (p. 368). In the following century, Muratori, accepting the Jewish origin of the word Giudecca, greatly confused the issue by relating the words Giudecca and ghetto (see quotation above, n. 13). His view was accepted by Vettor Sandi, Principi di storia civile della repubblica di Venezia dalla suafondazione sino nell'anno di N. S. 1700, 3 vols. (Venice, 1755-1756), vol. 3, pt. 1, p. 436, who was severely criticized by Tentori, Saggio, 2:196-97. Interestingly, Stringa, who denied the Jewish derivation of Giudecca, correctly added a gloss to the entry "ghetto" in Sansovino, explaining that the ghetto was so called because formerly artillery was cast there, as could be ascertained from the ball painted on the main gate: "Anticamente vi si gettavano l'artigliarie: si come per segno si vede ancora una balla dipinta posta sopra la porta maestra" (fol. 256r-v). This explanation, dropped from the third edition, led Roth to suggest "that conceivably this may have been the origin of the pawnbroker's characteristic sign of the Three Balls, never I think adequately explained"; see Personalities and Events in Jewish History (Philadelphia, 1961), p. 236, n. 9. Perhaps Roth's hypothesis can be supported by the fact that, from 1573 on, the Jews operated three loan banks in the Venetian ghetto. Apropos of the origin of the word ghetto, see the passage in Temanza, Antica pianta, p. 70: "Quell'ampia Isola, che ora di ricetto al maggior numero degli Ebrei, denominato Ghetto Nuovo, contiguo al Rio di S. Girolamo, sino dal principio del Secolo XV. era una fondura, ed una pozzanghera. L'altra vicina verso Canareggio, che Ghetto Vecchio s'appella, gid molto prima abbonita, ed innalzata, era destinata alle Pubbliche Fonderie, ed era la Sede del Magistrato presidente alle stesse. Perci6 quel luogo dicevasi il Getto. Ivi c'erano XII. Fornaci, i rifiuti, ed i calcinacci delle quali si spargevano di tratto in tratto sulla prossima fondura. In questo modo a poco a poco si e fatta la bonificazione di quell'Isola, sulla quale vi furono poi murate quelle Case, che oggidi si veggono, le quali prima, che gli Ebrei nel 1516. vi mettessero piede, ricettavano numerose Famiglie di Cristiani." The first part of this description was substantially reproduced by Tentori, Saggio, 2:196-97. Gallicciolli, Memorie venete, 1:111-13 (sec. 120) also presented this etymology for the ghetto, but did not accept it, preferring to derive the name of the Jewish ghetto from the Hebrew nghedah ('edah), synagogue, group or congregation, in Aramaic and Syriac nghetto, transliterated into Italian as ghetto. See Giuseppe Tassini, Curiositih veneziane (Venice, 1887), pp. 319-20, s.v. "ghetto vecchio," for references to the ghetto-foundry prior to the settlement of the Jews on the site in 1516, and a rejection of this etymology proposed by Gallicciolli. This obvious origin of the term ghetto in Venice has not always been recognized. Although "discovered" by David Kaufmann (see his "A Contribution to the History of the Venetian Jews," Jewish Quarterly Review, o.s. 2 [1899-90]: 297-98, 302-3) it was not universally ac- cepted, and indeed became the subject of much controversy. See the index entry "ghetto" in A. Milano, Bibliotheca historica italo-judaica (Florence, 1954), the Supplemento, 1954-1963 (Florence, 1964) and "Bibliografia degli studi sulla storia degli Ebrei in Italia, 1964-1966," La rassegna mensile di Israel 32 (1966): 3-19 (supplement following p. 428); also Ariel Toaff, "Getto-ghetto," The American Sephardi 6 (1973): 71-77. In my article, "The Establishment of the Ghetto Vecchio of Venice, 1541: Background and Reappraisal," Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress for Jewish Studies, 1973 (Jerusalem, 1975), 2:160, n. 17, I have pointed out that caution should be taken in arguing on orthographical grounds, since official Venetian documents dealing with the establishment of the ghetto nuovo of 1516 employ the spelling geto and getto, while in legislation of 1541 es- tablishing the ghetto vecchio, all four possible spellings ghetto, gheto, getto, and geto are en- countered.</page><page sequence="10">210 BENJAMIN RAVID on was called Giudecca or Giudaica because the Jews dwelled there for a long time, until they were confined to the ghetto.19 However, this harmonizing interpretation did not survive the following century. The origin of the term Giudecca became a subject of discussion in the brief treatments of the Jews of Venice contained in multi-volume histories of the city undertaken by eighteenth century historians, and also in more specialized works. Vettor Sandi, in his Principi di storia civile della repubblica di Venezia (1756) did not specifically deal with the origin of the name Giudecca, but in a passing comment appears to have accepted its Jewish origin.20 This view was, however, questioned soon after by Tommaso Temanza in his Antica pianta dell'inclita citta di Venezia (Venice, 1781).21 He granted that in many documents in the records of the Piovego (a magistracy of the Venetian government) the island was called Judeca. In an attempt to explain that name, he related that in the city of Constantinople a place had been called Judeca as early as 1090 and suggested that perhaps it was from there that the Venetian Judeca obtained its name. To bolster his theory, he pointed out that du Cange, in his lexicon, under the entry "Judaica" listed the various names given to Jewish quarters, without citing the form Judeca.22 Prior to 1516,23 he concluded, the Jews did not have a designated place to live in Venice, and dwelled dispersed throughout the city, in the houses of the Christians, always near to the piazze, for they lived only from trade and the island of Giudecca could not have been convenient for them. Cristoforo Tentori, in his Saggio sulla storia civile politica ecclesiastica e sulla corografia e topografia degli stati della repubblica di Venezia (Venice, 1785-90) repeated the arguments of Temanza almost verbatim, without acknowledging his debt to Temanza in this matter.24 Denying explicitly that 19.

(Sandi, however, did not follow Muratori in stating that the Giudecca mentioned in the diplomata of the Doge Vitale Faletro was the Giudecca of Venice, but rather located it in Constantinople.)

Pointing out that since it was certain that the Jews had established synagogues all over the city in which they lived dispersed, Tentori, possibly attempting to refute the arguments of an unnamed and still unidentified predecessor, asked why it should be surprising that two synagogues had been built on the Giudecca, and who would ever be induced to believe that therefore all the Jews (il Corpo Nazionale) lived on that island.26 Gallicciolli in his Delle memorie venete (1795) was most uncertain about the origin of the term Giudecca. He questioned the "Jewish derivation" theory, primarily because Jews had lived all over the city dispersed among the Christians, and were not numerous enough in the thirteenth century (cf. his reservations about the date of the alleged census of 1152, above) to im- part their name to their area of sojourn by 1252, yet conceded that it was not impossible. He concluded with observing that since it was so uncertain and a mere supposition, he could only make the following conjecture: the lands on Spinalunga assigned to the Flabanici and Caloprini families (who earlier had their property confiscated because of their assassination of the Doge Tradimene) at the time of their reconciliation in the late ninth century were referred to as land assigned dal giudicato, i.e., by judgment of a magistracy or council. In Venetian dialect, this became Zudeca, then Judecha, Zuecca and finally Giudaica because of notaries who wished to write Latin and perhaps did not know the origin of the name. Nevertheless, Gallicciolli had reservations about this interpretation, for he immediately added that he did not wish to "stand surety" for his opinion.27 25. Tentori, Saggio, 2:195-96: "Non da' Giudei, come il Volgo si crede, poiche non ci habitarono giammai, ma da Santi dieci, che ci sono, alla Greca anticamente ebbe il nome." 26.

The only substantially new piece of information to become available was the report, contained in a work on the Giudecca published in 1832, that a few years earlier a stone one square foot in size containing Hebrew characters engraved on one side had been found on the Giudecca, but by 1832 had been lost.28 Nevertheless, the discussion of the origin of the name Giudecca con- tinued, often characterized more by dogmatism than by accurate considera- tion of previous arguments and introduction of new insights, until finally it was not only asserted that the Jews had lived on the Giudecca and given the island its name, but even that the Jewish settlement on the Giudecca con- stituted a compulsory Jewish quarter, adumbrating the ghetto established in 1516. An examination of the arguments advanced by Venetian writers (see Appendix below) and twentieth century Jewish scholars who all accepted the Jewish derivation29 seems to lead to the same uncertainty admitted to by the more cautious authors on the subject. It appears that while the extant evidence for even the presence of the Jews on the island, let alone for the "Jewish origin" for the name Giudecca, is highly circumstantial, Zudega, judicatum facere. Questa guisa di parlare probabilmente degenerb prima in Zudeca, poi Judecha, Zuecca, e finalmente Giudaica, perche i Notaj volendo scrivere latino, ne sapendo forse l'origine del nome, credettero bene espresso judaica e judaea. lo perb non voglio esser mallevadore di questa mia opinione."

Gallicciolli acknowledged that there had been on the Giudecca two synagogues which had been destroyed "not too many years ago" to make way for new construction ("non sono molti anni che due sinagoghe alla zuecca furono rovinate per farvi altri edifizj"), but on the basis of the legislation of 1516 establishing the ghetto, which had stated that the Jews were erecting syn- agogues everywhere, claimed that the two synagogues could not have originated in the thirteenth century, by which time the island was already known as la Zuecca; Memorie venete, 1:116 (sec. 121). For a slightly less skeptical approach, see 2:279 (sec. 876). 28.

This hesitantly offered conclusion-which really represents more a brief summary of the treatment of the problem than a clear-cut decision-may be corroborated by a seventeenth century Hebrew source linking the Jews with the Giudecca, first published by Moses A. Shulvass in 1949. A Hebrew chronicle, entitled A Story of the Misfortunes Which Afflicted [the Jews] in Italy, written presumably by a Jew, whose name is not known, living in or near Venice some time between 1648 and 1663 but apparently not utilized by any historian prior to its publication, contained some information on Giudecca and the Jews, and in passing referred to the "Jewish derivation" of the name of the island.3" The seventh episode in the Story was entitled "The Decree of Giuecca, A Small Island in the City of Venice." The account opens: I heard that also in the great city of Venice, the capital of the Dominante, may its glory be exalted, many evils and troubles afflicted the people of God, es- pecially that they [the Venetians] did not wish that the Jews live in the midst of the city. They dwelled in the days of old on the Giuecca, a small island a bow- shot away from Venice. Its name had formerly been Giudaicca, from the name of the Jews who dwelled there, similarly to Toledo, which was called Toletula in recollection of the wanderings of the Jews when they came to Spain (as Abravanel [Commentary on Kings, end] wrote). There on the Giudaicca they dwelled for a time in wealth and honor. Some of the Venetians, envying the Jews, the account continued, decided to take their possessions. Accordingly, suddenly they attacked the Jews, and in one day looted their property, and killed all, except for one little boy from a noble family called, in German, Lippman, who had hidden himself. On hearing about this, the "rulers of Venice" became very angry, went to the Giudaicca to investigate the illegal act, and found alive only the little boy, surrounded by wealth (apparently not everything had been stolen). Pitying the boy, they decided to convert him to Christianity, and later marry him to the daughter of a Venetian noble, so that the wealth of the Jews be theirs, and 30. M. A.

And if it is not absolute proof, it is still of some account that in the manuscript book entitled Origine delli nobili [The Origin of the Nobles] it is written that the Lippimani family came from Jewish stock. And this they admitted many times and were not ashamed, knowing that the Jew was respected among his people, because of his place, ancestry and family, since he was of the sons of kings, worthy of kingship.3' Additional information on this incident is contained in an untitled list of incidents which befell the Jews of Italy, published by Isaiah Sonne as a con- tinuation to the above cited Story of the Misfortunes.32 The close cor- respondence between this untitled list, written in the later sixteenth century or possibly early seventeenth, and parts of the Story, makes it clear that the two were related, probably both being based on an unknown common source. The parallel account in the list recorded that the expulsion from the Giudecca was without reason; while the government tried to protect them, it could not save them, since the evil ones in one day killed and looted, and there survived only one small boy called Lippman who converted and afterwards became a citizen, and from him descended the Lip- pimani house, as can be seen in their book Origine de nobili."3 This account did not relate the "Jewish derivation" of the name Giudec- ca, but most significantly gave a date for the incident: "1244, according to their reckoning" [i.e., A.D.]. This date was considered by Sonne, without any 31. HUCA 22 (1949): 17-18; Paul IV, pp. 198-99. Shulvass observed that the story was not confirmed by any other source and believed that it was one of the legendary stories on the Jews of Venice which have a historical basis; apparently its intention was to explain the end, under unknown circumstances, of the Jewish settlement on the Giudecca (HUCA, p. 17, n. 58). Shulvass also noted that according to the Chronicle, the first Jewish settlers were Ashkenazim, i.e., of German origin, while it had hitherto been ac- cepted that the first Jews in Venice had been Levantine merchants. Actually, the Chronicle did not state that the first settlers were Ashkenazim, but only that one family was called, in German, Lippman. The phenomenon of the resentment of the Jewish wealth should not be taken literally, since the author of the Chronicle often utilized that theme in his attempt to ex- plain anti-Jewish hostility; see the comments of Sonne, HUCA, pp. 24-25 and Paul IV, pp. 184- 85 placing that theme in its sixteenth century context. 32. First published by I. Sonne, "Chapters from a Tract on Expulsions," HUCA 22 (1949): 23-44 (Hebrew section).

HUCA, p. 30; Paul IV, p. 198.</page><page sequence="15">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 215 explanation, to constitute "apparently a later addition."34 Interestingly, the first reference to the island of Spinalunga as Giudecca, spelled Judecha, was, as stated above, encountered in a document of 1254. I have so far been unable to obtain any material from the Origine delli nobili, written by Marco Barbaro during the second half of the eighteenth century, but do possess some relevant information from the Famiglie venete, written by Cappellari, also in the second half of that century, and preserved in the Venetian State Archives. In the Famiglie venete, under the entry "Lip- pamano" (sic), it is related that the family's ancestors, according to previous chronicles, were Jews living in Negroponte, who after "discovering the true laws of God" converted and gave up all their property. Subsequently, one of them, named Steven, after finding a very substantial subterranean treasure, rehabilitated the family which then moved to Venice in 908, where it enjoyed citizenship, and finally became ennobled in 1381.35 If this account in the Famiglie venete is to be accepted, then it cannot be maintained that a Jewish boy named Lippman, who survived a massacre on the Venetian Giudecca, was the founder of the house of Venetian nobles bearing that name. However, since Lippman is a not infrequently en- countered Jewish name, it is possible that a Jewish boy named Lippman, who was the only survivor of a massacre on the Giudecca, somehow came to be identified with the Jewish ancestor of the house of Lippomano. It could also be conjectured that the Story originally related an incident in the history of the Giudecca of Negroponte, rather than that of Venice. In any case, the written Hebrew manuscripts probably reflect older oral traditions whose exact "historical kernel" can no longer be ascertained. Certainly, the account in the Famiglie venete casts doubt on the accuracy of the Hebrew Story and list. Additionally, the association of the "Jewish derivation" of the Giudecca in the Story with the Hebrew derivation of 34. HUCA, p. 30; Paul IV, p. 198. 35. Famiglie venete, 2:665-66: "Li suoi maggiori per attestato del Malfatti et di altre Croniche furono Giudei, quali venuti in cognitione della vera Legge di Dio, presero l'aqua del Santo Battesimo et lasciarono tutte le loro facolth, ma Stefano uno di essi, havendo poi trovato un grandissimo tesoro sotto terra, ingrandi la casa, et rese il lustro alla famiglia, quale secondo il Frescot, si trasferi a Venetia l'anno 908, dove gode la cittadinanza sino che l'anno 1381. per li servigi resi da Pietro Lippamano capo della famiglia nella guerra di Chioggia, venne ag- gregata all'ordine patritio." I wish to thank Signorina Frizziero for locating and sending me reproductions of the pages on the Lippomano family in the Famiglie venete and for informing me that Malfatti and Frescot were chroniclers of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth cen- turies; since she has also advised me that there are over 1,000 other chronicles, it seems that the vicissitudes of the Lippomani family merit a separate study.</page><page sequence="16">216 BENJAMIN RAVID Toledo from Toletula does not inspire further confidence. However, the casual and incidental manner in which the Jewish derivation of the Giudec- ca was introduced makes it appear that the the account as preserved in the Story was not related in order to establish or even primarily to assert that derivation. Possibly, if some Venetian Christians believed that the term Giudecca derived from Judaica as a result of the residence of the Jews on the island, the Jews themselves would have accepted that view; the fact that the date 1244 was given according to the Christian rather than the Jewish calen- dar may indicate an original Christian version of the tale and support this view. But on the other hand, the converse cannot be precluded: since the written texts of the Hebrew Story and list are based on earlier traditions, es- pecially for the older material, perhaps the non-Jewish Venetian writers who advocated the "Jewish derivation" of the term Giudecca acquired that etymology from the Jews. Since the origin of the name Giudecca remains unresolved to this day, and its "Jewish derivation" is most speculative indeed, this hypothesis cer- tainly cannot be used as the basis for the assertion that the Jews lived on the Giudecca, let alone that they were required by law to live only on that island.36 Furthermore, even if it should ever be conclusively established that 36. The only twentieth century writer to sound a cautious note was Gino Luzzatto in his "Breve cenni introduttivi ad una guida dei templi veneziani," La rassegna mensile di Israel 30 (1964): 204. Luzzatto did not mention either the population estimate of 1152 or the customs payment of 1290, but merely noted that the information regarding the presence of Jews in Venice before the sixteenth century was very uncertain and fragmentary. He related that it was generally affirmed that a group of them lived in the city on the basis of the name Giudecca given to the island previously known as Spinalunga. He observed, however, that except for the name, which undoubtedly had a notable significance since it was used to designate the quarter in which the Jews resided of their own will in Southern Italy, no other evidence had been preserved proving the existence of this colony on the island of Spinalunga. No value, he as- serted, could be ascribed to the oral tradition according to which that alleged community had two synagogues. However, he added that even if no definite records remained of groups of Jews dwelling in Venice between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, it was certain that Venice became the preferred port of transit for many Jews, who often for business reasons stayed there for some time. Additionally, he pointed out that Benjamin of Tudela did not give any informa- tion on Jews living in the region north of the Appennines (p. 203). Cf. also Luzzatto's views ex- pressed in his Storia economica di Venezia dall XI al XVI secolo, p. 40: "The Jews seem, although it cannot be documented with certainty, to have been assigned for a certain time as residence the island of Spinalunga, which owed to them its name of Giudecca and that expelled from there, they moved to Mestre, outside the dogado." However, if the conjectured Jewish in- habitants of Spinalunga were Levantine merchants, it is highly unlikely that they moved to Mestre, where, as far as is known, the only Jewish inhabitants were moneylenders from elsewhere in Italy and from Germany. (See now Mueller, "Les preteurs juifs.") Baron, while accepting the traditional view regarding the role of the Jews in Venetian com-</page><page sequence="17">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 217 Jews did live on the Giudecca, it would still be necessary to prove that they engaged in the overseas Levant trade, rather than in the more usual Jewish occupation, especially in northern Italy, of moneylending37 or, since the earlier centuries are involved, other activities such as commerce with Northern or Western Europe or some kind of crafts. IV CONCLUSION Thus, in conclusion: 1) the census of 1152 appears to be misdated and probably should be applied to the mid-sixteenth century; 2) the customs legislation of 1290 does not refer to any commercial activity on the part of the Jews in the city of Venice itself but rather in the eastern Venetian stato da mar; merce, nevertheless observed that "no definitely Jewish names could be identified in the exten- sive collection of Documenti del commercio veneziano nei secoli XI-XIII, vols. 1 and 2 compiled by R. Morozzo Della Rocca and A. Lombardo," Baron, SRHJ, 4:332, n. 47. See also now Nuovi documenti del commercio veneto dei secoli XI-XIII (Venice, 1953) by the same authors. (See also the views of Zordan, Le persone nella storia del diritto veneziano prestatutario, sum- marized in the Appendix below.) In support of the possibility that Jews came to Venice as traders without however settling in the city, see the following from Batisa Krekic, Dubrovnik in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Cen- turies: A City Between East and West (Norman, Oklahoma, 1972), p. 30: "A 'Giudecca' is men- tioned at this time [the middle of the fourteenth century] in Dubrovnik, probably a Jewish quarter, situated in the eastern suburb of the city. However, since there were very few Jews in Dubrovnik and there is no proof that any had settled permanently in the city, it seems probable that the Giudecca designated the place where foreign Jewish merchants lived while visiting Dubrovnik." 37.

Therefore, although neither the possibility of Jewish settlement nor of Jewish commercial activity in the city of Venice during the twelfth or thirteenth centuries can be categorically precluded (and of course, the latter is more probable than the former), new and hitherto unknown documenta- tion will have to be found to substantiate the existence of either.38 38. Thus the account of Roth, Venice, pp. 8-12 requires fundamental revision. There is no evidence whatsoever that "a transient Jewish population gradually gathered in the city" (p. 9). Neither can it be maintained that "the city became recognized as a center of Jewish pop- ulation" (p. 11) on the basis of the two pieces of evidence offered by Roth: that Isaiah di Trani resided for some time in Venice, and that in 1288 Hillel of Verona suggested Venice as one of the possible places to convene a conference to settle the Maimonidean controversy. Regarding Isaiah di Trani, it is only related that he used to travel by boat (gondola?) in Venice on the Sabbath; see Shibbole ha-Leqel, ed. Solomon Buber (Vilna, 1866), p. 42a. However, one cannot conclude from this that Isaiah lived in Venice for any length of time, and assert that Venice was a center of Jewish population. Although very little is known about Isaiah of Trani, it is known that he traveled widely and possibly spent time in Venice awaiting suitable transportation elsewhere. For speculation that he may have traveled from Venice to Palestine, see S. K. Mirsky, "R. Isaiah of Trani and the Author of Shiboley Haleket" (Hebrew), Talpiot 9 (1964-65): 78. Isaiah justified his conduct with the rationale that the gondola would make its journey in any case, and hence no labor was being performed specially for a Jew (the Hebrew legal principle, le-'asman hem mitkavvenim). See also Mirsky's edition of Shibbolei Haleket Completum by R. Zedekiah Ben R. Abraham Harofe (New York, 1966), p. 33. In the seventeenth century, the Venetian Rabbi Simone Luzzatto issued a ruling permitting travel by gondola on the Sabbath, but the lay council of the Jewish community made him rescind his ruling, which is now no longer extant and hence Luzzatto's reasoning is unknown; see Isaac Lampronte, Pabad Yibaq (Hebrew), 12 vols. (Venice, Reggio, Lyck and Berlin, 1749-1887), 7:58b and Roth, Venice, p. 230. Hillel of Verona had indeed suggested Venice as one of the possible places to convene a con- ference to settle the Maimonidean controversy; see The Responsa of Maimonides (Hebrew) 3 vols. (Leipzig, 1859), 3:14b. He also suggested Marseilles and Genoa. While Marseilles did have a Jewish community throughout the Middle Ages, it is very problematic indeed whether there was a Jewish community in thirteenth century Genoa; see Roth, "Genoese Jews in the Thirteenth Century," Speculum 25 (1950): 190-97, and the reservations expressed by David Jacoby in his "The Jews in Chios Under Genoese Rule, 1346-1566" (Hebrew), Zion 26 (1961): 186, n. 42. Unfortunately, I have so far not been able to locate the source of the statement of Roth (Venice, p. 10) that "ancient records speak even of a Jew who was instrumental in introducing this vital branch of commerce to the city."</page><page sequence="19">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 219 APPENDIX THE GIUDECCA ACCORDING TO NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY AUTHORS ON VENICE Michele Battagia, Cenni storici e statistici sopra l'isola della Giudecca (Venice, 1832), pp. 14-15, 46-47, discussed briefly the origin of the name Giudecca. On the basis of a stone with Hebrew characters on it found on the island (see above, n. 28), the existence of a district in Ferrara named Giudec- ca because the Jews lived there, and finally the universal tradition of the in- habitants of the Giudecca who pointed out "con aspetto di fidanza" the places where the Jews lived which had been shown to them by their ancestors, Battagia affirmed his agreement with Sansovino and Gallicciolli (sic) that it was most probable and reasonable, but not certain, that the island of Spinalunga derived its name of Giudecca from the fact that the first Jews to live in Venice resided there. However, he wrote that some peo- ple claimed without proof that the island was called Giudecca before the Jews lived in Venice, and asserted that it was possible that in order to give the island its new name of Giudecca, it would perhaps have been sufficient for a few Jews to have lived there for a while, without forming a ghetto which was established only in the sixteenth century, especially since the loca- tion was convenient for them because of the abundance of goods to be found on the island. In a note (pp. 46-47), Battagia explicitly rejected the views of Temanza (see text above) as a very weak conjecture, formulated out of the desire to argue rather than to admit the most probable view, while he termed the derivation from the judgment assigning the lands to the Flabanici and Caloprini a forced conjecture. Ermolao Paoletti, Ilfiore di Venezia, 3 vols. (Venice, 1837-40), 1:165-66, noted, without citing sources, that some derived the name of Giudecca from the sojourn of the Jews while others with more plausibility derived it from the giudicato assigning the lands to the Flabanici and Caloprini as compen- sation for their confiscated lands. Giudicato, pronounced in olden times Zudeca or Zudega, could easily have changed to Judeca, Zuecca and finally Giudaica and Giudecca. The entry "La Giudecca" in Venezia e le sue lagune, 2 vols. (Venice,</page><page sequence="20">220 BENJAMIN RAVID 1847), 2: 493-94, stated that some derived the name of the Giudecca from the Jews (with a reference to the 1603 edition of Sansovino), but that it was perhaps better derived by others from the word giudicato, in Venetian dialect Zudega (with a reference to Paoletti). Giuseppe Cappelletti, Storia della repubblica di Venezia dal suo principio sino al giorno d'oggi, 13 vols. (Venice, 1850-55), 9:122-23, rejected the view that the Giudecca could be named after the Jews, for in Venetian dialect it was called Zueca, not Giudecca. He believed that the name originated from the judgment assigning the lands to the Barbolani, Flabanici and Caloprini. With a footnote reference to Paoletti and Venezie e sue lagune, Cappelletti explained that the original name in Venetian dialect, Zudega or Zudec", had then changed to Zudeca and finally to Giudecca. He believed that the name could not derive from the Jews, since it was already used in 1252, while no one thought of assigning the Jews specific quarters prior to 1385, up to which time they lived spread out throughout the city, and were not required to live on the Giudecca or anywhere else. He conceded the existence of the two synagogues, but considered their presence to be inconclusive, since it was not known when they were built, and in any case they could not be used to prove that the Jews were required to live in that area, for the Jews could live wherever they wished in the city. Samuele Romanin, Storia documentata di Venezia, 10 vols. (Venice, 1853-61), 1:46, presented both views, and believed that both were very dubious, the Jewish derivation because there was no information about Jewish families residing there in sufficient numbers in those remote times to give their name to so large an island, while the other was termed too forced on linguistic grounds. Noting that there was a porta Jubalica (sic) in Con- stantinople in the thirteenth century, Romanin suggested that the name came from Constantinople. However, in the same volume, under "Addi- tions and Corrections" (p. 371), Romanin noted that in Constantinople there was a Giudecca and a Porta Giudecca, while in Tana there was a Zudecha. This inclined him to believe that a place on Spinalunga had been assigned either as a residence for the Jews or as a quay for their goods, and slowly the name spread to the entire island, which at that time was still to a great extent swampland. Giuseppe Tassini, Curiosith veneziane (Venice, 1887), pp. 341-42, related that the name Giudecca seemed to derive from the many Jews who settled</page><page sequence="21">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 221 there in the early times. Tassini cited the arguments of Battagia (erroneously attributing to him also mention of the two synagogues destroyed in the eighteenth century), but also presented the other giudicato view, without citing any sources. The article of Luigi Schiavi, "Gli Ebrei in Venezia e nelle sue colonie," Nuova antologia di scienza, lettere ed arti, 3d ser. 67 (1893): 309-33, 485-519, became an important source for subsequent writers on the Jews of Venice, because despite its disorganized structure, it was the most extensive article dealing exclusively with the Jews of Venice (as opposed to the references to them in general histories of the city or in guidebooks), and in- cluded material from the Diarii of Marino Sanuto, then in course of publica- tion (58 vols., 1879-1903). Schiavi misled subsequent writers by stating, without giving a source, that groups of Levantine Jewish merchants ob- tained a place on the Giudecca to deposit the goods which they brought from the orient. There was no doubt, he continued, about this trade, since a decree of 1290 fixed the import and export tax of the Jews at 5 percent (p. 312). Additionally, he related (pp. 318-19), that just as the Jews of the terra ferma had a fixed abode in Mestre, so too he believed that those who traded with Dalmatia lived temporarily on the Giudecca. The name Giudecca, he asserted, was undoubtedly derived from the word Jew, citing in support the Zudeca of Candia and the Jewish quarter of Messina. Schiavi observed that Cappelletti had rejected this derivation on the grounds that in 1252 the island had already been called Zueca and had stated without proof that the Jews had not lived there, but, concluded Schiavi, since Cappelletti acknowledged the existence of the ancient synagogues on the island, on which were found Hebrew tombstones now at the Lido, his opposition seemed unfounded. Eugenio Musatti in his Guida storica di Venezia (Milan, 1904), pp. 226-27, rejected the view of Gallicciolli and accepted the theory that the name Giudecca signified the quarter of the Jews, citing the Giudecca of Candia (on the basis of Schiavi) and the Giudecca of Negroponte (on the basis of a line encountered in poetry and prose on Negroponte, dating back to 1470: "A la Zudecca dove sta li Zudei," published in Archivio storico italiano 9 [1853]: 404), both of which belonged to Venice. Musatti also con- tributed the information that Dante had used the word Giudecca in his Divine Comedy, Inferno 34:117, for the circle of Judas. Finally, Musatti</page><page sequence="22">222 BENJAMIN RAVID seemed to have believed that the Jews were permitted to live only on the Giudecca (see also p. 157, n. 4). Heinrich Kretschmayr, Geschichte von Venedig, 3 vols. (Gotha and Stutt- gart, 1905-34), 2 (1920):459 believed that the Jews were required to live on the Giudecca, and were confined to it until the erection of the ghetto in 1516. Additionally, presumably conflating the data on the census of 1152 and the assumed residence of the Jews on Spinalunga, Kretschmayr related that the Jews appeared to have resided in Mestre and on Spinalunga already in the twelfth century (2:288). Sicinio Bonfanti, La Giudecca (Venice, 1930), pp. 18-21, commenced his lengthy discussion of the origin of the name Giudecca by referring to Bat- tagia. He related that Battagia had reported the opinion of Gallicciolli that the island owed its name to the fact that the first Jews who came to Venice settled there either voluntarily or by law. Thus, commented Bonfanti, the Giudecca would have been the first ghetto, suggesting that perhaps an island was chosen because it was easier to supervise without need of walls or gates. Bonfanti reproduced Battagia's information about the stone with Hebrew characters, and most interestingly related that "other stones with Hebrew letters were found in other excavations around twenty years earlier" (i.e., around 1910). Bonfanti then presented the other arguments of Battagia and also the views of Temanza, pointed out that some derived the name Giudec- ca from the judgment compensating the Flebanici (sic) and Caloprini for land previously confiscated, quoting at length from Musatti to explain the background, and finally cited Musatti's arguments in favor of the Jewish derivation. He also related some observations of the "diligente e colto g.m. del Gazzattino" (Tassini?) who in one of his Curiosita veneziane wrote that until 1516 the Jews were never able to live permanently in the city, but were only allowed to live temporarily for periods ranging from fifteen days to five years. However, they did live "much longer" at Mestre, where they built a synagogue, while those who traded with Dalmatia were able by virtue of a special decree of the Senate to live on Spinalunga, called thenceforth by the Jews Giudecca. (I have not come across any reference to such a law in any documents in the Venetian archives or elsewhere in the secondary literature on the city of Venice, its commerce and its Jews.) A paragraph replete with errors on the history of the Jews of Venice follows. Elsewhere (pp. 48-49) Bonfanti quoted a passage from the Diarii of Sanuto, from August 1, 1525 (39:269-70), relating that some Jews were found walking on the Giudecca.</page><page sequence="23">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 223 On the basis of this one account, Bonfanti wrote that it could be seen that in the sixteenth century, the Jews frequented the island, and some certainly lived there (this was impossible, since legislation of 1516 had required all the Jews to live in the ghetto) but their sojourn on the island was not pleasing, probably because of the recollection that they or their ancestors had been relegated to that island, or because they had not been kindly received there. Bonfanti sought additional support for the presence of the Jews on the Giudecca from another passage in the Diarii. Sanuto had related that on April 22, 1515 (one year before the Jews were required to live in the ghetto) a motion was made in the College proposing that the Jews, who were numerous and living all over the city and giving a bad example to the Chris- tians, should all be sent to live in the Zueca. Upon hearing about this, Sanuto continued, some Jews protested that it would be dangerous for them to live on the Zueca, proposed that it would be preferable to be sent to Murano, and made so many objections that the Council did not assent to the motion (Diarii, 20:138; [cf. Roth, Venice, p. 48; the characterization of the Giudecca as "the island where, according to report, the original Jewish merchants from the Levant had established themselves, centuries before" is not to be found in Sanuto and constitutes a gloss by Roth]). Bonfanti stated that this proposal to send the Jews to the Giudecca implicitly supported the hypothesis that the island had been their first place of confinement. Bonfanti concluded with the most pertinent comment that while other obligations prevented him from undertaking further research in this area, which was both interesting and little known, he was certain that on the basis of the Diarii, it would be possible to reconstruct a rather complete picture of the life and conditions of the Jews in the sixteenth century; remarkably, such a reconstruction was indeed partially undertaken by Roth in his Venice, the first book-length treatment of the Jews of Venice, which appeared in 1930, the same year as the volume of Bonfanti. See now, however, the much more extensive presentation in Pullan, Rich and Poor in Renaissance Venice (Cambridge, 1971), pp. 431-621. I wish to thank Professor David Jacoby for drawing my attention, after this article was submitted and accepted for publication, to the discussion of the Giudecca in Giorgio Zordan, Le persone nella storia del diritto veneziano prestatutorio (Padua, 1973). Specifically, pp. 92-116 of that book deal with the Jews. On p. 99, Zordan quoted the text of the customs legislation of 1290, commenting that it acknowledged the importance of the commercial activities of the Jews; he additionally pointed out that the very low 5 percent</page><page sequence="24">224 BENJAMIN RAVID import and export duty was not far removed from that imposed on other foreign merchants (p. 100). Zordan referred to the census figure of 1,300 Jews (wrongly ascribing it to "around the middle of the eleventh century"; perhaps a typographical error: XI for XII), commenting that even though it was in all probability somewhat exaggerated, it gave grounds for presuming that the Jews formed a quite substantial group in the city at that time. Many could have stayed in it with their merchandise in transit for a few days, but some certainly resided and conducted their affairs there, supporting their families. However, Zordan termed "unfounded, or perhaps more exactly, erroneous" the statement of Roth (Venice, p. 9) that in this period the Jews "were not indeed permitted to reside in the heart of the city. They had to deposit their merchandise and to conduct their affairs on the island of Spinalunga [which] ultimately received, by reason of its infidel inhabitants, the name of Giudecca." Zordan considered the problems of the origin of the name Giudecca, when the island of Spinalunga came to be called Giudecca, and the residence of the Jews on the island to be among those destined probably to remain unsolved due to the irremediable scarcity of documents; he stated that he would not presume to be able to clarify the matter, but only indicate how necessary it was to proceed cautiously so as not to reach hasty conclusions. In this spirit, Zordan pointed out that the Giudecca referred to in 1090 was the Zuecca of Constantinople, and not Spinalunga of Venice. Actually, he claimed, Spinalunga was first called Giudecca in legislation of September 23, 1254 (on the date see p. 102, n. 27 and n. 14 above). That legislation provided that land on the swampy part of the island was to be as- signed by the doge and his council to individuals considered suitable for draining it and settling there. It did not specify that Jews were to be moved to it, although it was not impossible that some Jews were granted land there as a result; but in any case, even if this could be demonstrated, the problem of the name would not be solved since the drained and inhabited part of the island was already called Giudecca in 1254. Since at that time there was already a church on that part of the Giudecca which had been drained, Zordan argued that Christians must have lived there, and therefore the island could not have been set aside previously exclusively for the Jews. Interestingly, he also claimed that the Giudecca could not have been the compulsory dwelling place of the Jews on the basis of references to two Jews dwelling outside the Giudecca: Ysaco de confinio Sancti Bartholomei in 1221, and Symon de Borge, also living in Santo Bartolomeo in 1253. While assuming that these individuals were Jews, Zordan observed (p. 105, n. 33), that it is not easy to identify Jews in Venetian documents since they are rare-</page><page sequence="25">MERCANTILE SETTLEMENT OF VENICE 225 ly referred to as ludeus, and identifying them on the basis of their first names alone was risky because of the old and widespread worship of the prophets and other "Old Testament" figures (presumably as a result, the Venetians tended to have biblical names, which were also frequent among the Jews); as an example he referred to a Salomone family, which was definitely Christian. Additionally, while Jews at that time rarely had family names and therefore should be easy to identify, the Venetians had not com- pletely given up the custom of identifying themselves by their patronymic or by their place of origin. (This would support the argument that Simon of Bruges could be a Christian!) While thus denying that the Giudecca was a compulsory Jewish quarter, Zordan granted that the possibility that some Jews might have lived voluntarily among the Christians on the Giudecca as well as elsewhere could not be precluded, especially since its location was very favorable for the Levant trade, and thus Jewish merchants, after having used the island as a place of deposit, began to settle there. Then, with the passing of time, around the very modest nucleus of Jews on the Giudecca, a small community of Jews could have come into being, not for legal reasons, but for psychological ones, in accordance with the tendency of members of minority groups to live together. However, Zordan asked whether this Jewish community dwelling among Christians on the first drained part of Spinalunga would have been numerous enough to make the name change to Giudecca. Here, Zordan conceded, one is in the realm of conjecture without any concrete proof, especially since some writers had proposed other etymologies. Citing only the Zudega-judgment view (p. 107, n. 38), Zordan considered it to be less acceptable both on the linguistic grounds given by Romanin (see above) and also because of the time lag between the judgment of 860 and the first encounter of the name Giudecca. Probably, Zordan con- cluded, without any evidence, the island came to be named Giudecca by analogy with other Jewish quarters with which the Venetians were familiar; however the Giudecca was not an area assigned to the Jews, but the one in which they were more numerous than elsewhere in the city. Finally, I wish to thank Frank Talmage for drawing my attention to the popular and not always accurate article of M. A. Burnston, "The Deriva- tion of the Word 'Ghetto'-La Giudecca, 'The Jewish Island,' " in Judaica Philatelic Journal 11 (1975): 1442-50. The article was inspired by the receipt of a postcard with the cancellation "Venice/Giudecca," and features reproductions of maps and postage stamps, including a Vatican block of four of a map of Venice showing the Giudecca.</page></plain_text>
