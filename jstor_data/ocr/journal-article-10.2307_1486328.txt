Marrano Poets of the Seventeenth Century: An Anthology of the Poetry of Jodo Pinto Delgado, Antonio Enriquez Gdmez, and Miguel de Barrios. Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1982. 296 pp. The creation of a class of Jewish converts to Christianity in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Spain and fifteenth-century Portugal had such vast repercussions that modern scholars have yet to analyze many of them. Timothy Oelman concerns himself with the literary sphere, more specifical- ly, with three seventeenth-century poets of converso ancestry. The poetry chosen splendidly reflects the dilemma of the converso vis-a-vis the question of loyalty to his ancestral religion. If the desire to express oneself fully as a Jew emerged (and crypto-Judaism was eschewed), the logical alternative was to abandon one's homeland. Nevertheless, even after successfully evading the ubiquitous tentacles of the Inquisition, the converso choosing overt rather than covert Jewish life was confronted by considerable psycho- logical and religious difficulties. The poetry in this anthology deals with these as well as other formidable obstacles and traumas faced by the "Marrano." Each poet's personal life story is fascinating, and Oelman provides background material for all three poets as well as for the phenomenon of crypto-Judaism and the literary ambiance of the time. Without this information, the reader could not begin to comprehend these men or their poetry; the editor provides a fairly even- handed historical introduction followed by an excellent literary presenta- tion. Clearly, Oelman is at home in the literary world of the Golden Age of Spain. Not only are his translations excellent, but his selection of material is outstanding. Each poet is represented by portions of the works that best reveal his Jewish consciousness and his experience as a Marrano. Since all were able to familiarize themselves with the Bible while living as Christians</page><page sequence="2">292 BOOK REVIEWS on the Iberian Peninsula, biblical themes abound. Jodio Pinto Delgado, for example, a Portuguese converso who eventually became a parnas in Amster- dam, chose themes from Esther, Jeremiah, and Ruth to symbolize redemp- tion, guilt, and faith as experienced by the Marrano. Once he became familiar with rabbinic literature, Pinto Delgado hesitated not to include knowledge of these sources as well. His poetry conveys the image of a pro- foundly religious individual who successfully integrated his Christian past and his native literary heritage with the Jewish culture he valued so highly. A more satirical but no less moving impression is conveyed by the select- ed poems of Antonio Enriquez G6mez, a Spaniard of mixed Old and New Christian parentage, who moved to Rouen, France, only to be arrested by the Inquisition while attempting a visit to his homeland. The most incredible poem included here records the Inquisitorial trial of a Spaniard (Old Chris- tian) who converted to Judaism during the course of his trial and thus died a Jewish martyr. Oelman provides copious notes for this as well as for all the other poems in the anthology and attempts to explain the veiled attacks on the church, its doctrines, and the Inquisition is addition to the references to Jewish sources and customs that can be discovered in the verse and between the lines. The third poet whose works are represented in this anthology was also a Spanish converso and differs from the others because he led a double life even after he left Iberia: as Miguel de Barrios of Brussels he was a Catholic Spanish army captain, and as Daniel Levi de Barrios of Amsterdam he was a practicing Jew. The poems included range from elegy to burlesque; this Marrano also displays particular concern with judgment and repentance. Likewise the reader can discern kabbalistic as well as liturgical overtones. The lives and the works of these three conversos who eventually joined their Jewish brethren poignantly reflect the duality of existence in and between two worlds. The reader with a comprehension of Spanish can admire the beauty of the language of the original works; the reader with a knowledge of Jewish texts can marvel at the erudition of the poets. At the same time, the reader of English alone can encounter a genre of literature previously unknown to him and enter the world of the Marrano intellectual. Accordingly, by publishing this anthology, Oelman has made an important contribution to our understanding of the phenomenon of Marranism.
