<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA by ARNOLD A. LASKER and DANIEL J. LASKER Introduction Halakhah does not develop in a vacuum. It grows through its confronta- tion with the changing conditions in which Jews live. New situations raise new questions which, in turn, require new answers. The process of determining the correct practice has involved more than reinterpreting talmudic discussions or simply following the post-talmudic codes. Other factors, which include local custom, the desire for Jewish uniformity, and the dictates of reason, have also played a major role. Stressing one or another of these factors over the others could very likely result in different conclusions. As a result, authorities very often have found themselves in disagreement as to what the halakhah on a particular point should be. A history of halakhah, therefore, needs to take into consideration the interplay of the various factors entering into decision-making and show which ultimately became dominant. 141</page><page sequence="2">142 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER To illustrate this point, we propose to study the following question: When is the Jewish prayer for rain to be said in the diaspora? By concen- trating on what is otherwise a relatively minor, technical point, we hope that certain principles which form the basis of halakhic development will become manifest. The Jewish prayer for rain consists of the insertion of the words tal u-malar ("dew and rain") in the ninth benediction of the Shemoneh 'Esreh (Birkat ha-Shanim - "The Blessing of the Years").' The practice of insert- ing this phrase into the blessing is a very old one. In tannaitic times, apparently the only question which arose about the insertion concerned the exact portion of the year when the prayer was to be said. The Mishnah records various proposed dates for beginning to say it. The accepted opinion was that attributed to Rabban Gamaliel, who ruled that the prayer for rain should commence on the seventh of Marbeshvan, "fifteen days after the feast, so that even the tardiest Israelite may reach the Euphrates [on the return journey from the pilgrimage to Jerusalem]."2 It is unclear from the context whether Rabban Gamaliel intended that the prayer for rain should begin invariably on the seventh of Marheshvan or only when there was a Temple and pilgrims.3 Conceivably, when there were no pilgrims, the prayer for rain could begin right after Shemini Atzeret.4 The authors would like to thank the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, which provided research grants, and the Bar-Ilan University Responsa Project, whose facilities were used in the retrieval of pertinent sources. 1. The phrase tal u-malar ("dew and rain") is biblical; see 1 Kings 17:1. In the Ashkenazic rite, the changeover from dry season to rainy season is effected by the addition of the words tal u-malar. In the Sefardic rite, the two seasons have different forms for the opening of the bene- diction: Barekh 'aleinu (with the words tal u-malar) for the rainy season, Barekheinu (without those words) for the dry season. On the ninth benediction of the Shemoneh 'Esreh, see, e.g., Ismar Elbogen, Der jiidische Gottesdienst in seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung (Frankfurt, 1931; [reprint ed. Hildesheim, 1962]), pp. 49-50. 2. Mishnah Ta'anit 1:3; see Henry Malter, ed., The Treatise Ta'anit of the Babylonian Talmud (Philadelphia, 1928), p. 2 (1967 ed., pp. 4-5). For our purposes, it is not important to determine the accuracy of the talmudic attributions. Later rabbinical authorities, who are our main concern here, took the talmudic material at face value. Thus, our discussion, for instance, of Rabbi Judah's reasoning is based on the later perspective of commentators and decisors. 3. From the discussion in both Talmuds (Bab. Ta'anit 4b; Jer. Ta'anit 1:2, 64a), it would appear that Rabban Gamaliel's ruling is applicable only in Temple times. See Joseph Heine- mann, ."Le-Verur Peshutan shel Mishnayot Abadot," Bar Ilan 3 (1965): 11-17. The current practice in the Land of Israel is to begin the prayer for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan. 4. Whereas the mention (hazkarah) of rain, with the words mashiv ha-rualh u-morid ha-geshem, begins on Shemini Atzeret itself, the prayer (she'elah) for rain, /al u-malar, is said only in the weekday Shemoneh 'Esreh and, thus, could not be said until after Shemini Atzeret.</page><page sequence="3">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 143 Babylonian practice was different from that of the Land of Israel. The Talmud reports that U1ananiah (a second-century tanna who moved from the Land of Israel to Babylonia) pointed out that the Babylonian Jews started to say tal u-matar much later than the seventh of Marbeshvan. They did not begin to do so until the sixtieth day from Tequfat Tishrei (the autumnal equinox).5 This practice was subsequently declared by Samuel to be the halakhah for Babylonian Jews.6 Despite this difference of procedure between the Jews of Babylonia and those of the Land of Israel as to when to start saying tal u-malar, they both agreed on when to stop saying it, the last weekday service prior to Passover.7 There were, of course, Jews living in other countries during talmudic times, but, unfortunately, we have no information as to when these communities prayed for rain. Only one case of this nature is mentioned, that of Nineveh (Nawe).s The Babylonian Talmud relates the story as follows: The inhabitants of Nineveh sent the following question to Rabbi [Judah ha- Nasi]: Inasmuch as we are in need of rain during the summer,9 are we to be 5. In the third century, the seventh of Marbeshvan fell between October 3 and November 1 (Gregorian); see A. A. Akavia, Calendar for 6000 Years (Jerusalem, 1975/76), adjusting his Julian dates for Gregorian by subtracting one day from the Julian to get the Gregorian (for the third century). Although we do not know exactly how Babylonian Jews in the third century calculated the equinox, we can compute that the sixtieth day after the astronomical equinox at that time fell on November 21. 'At the present time, the rules for calculation set down by Samuel (Erubin 56a) are employed, and, as a result, the autumnal equinox is presumed to fall on October 7, and the prayer for rain in the Diaspora begins sixty days later, starting with Ma'ariv of either December 4 or 5; see below, n. 97. 6. See Bab. Ta'anit 10a; Malter, Ta'anit, p. 69 (1967 ed., pp. 138-140), Jer. Ta'anit 63d. The "sixtieth day from the equinox [shishim yom ba-tequfah]" ultimately became more precisely defined as the sixtieth day counting from the equinoctial day, or fifty-nine days after the equinox. The reasons for the difference between the dates in the Land of Israel and Babylonia are explored in the authors' "The Jewish Prayer for Rain in Babylonia," to appear in the Journal for the Study of Judaism. 7. Namely, in Minhah on the eve of Passover; see Mishnah Ta'anit 1:1-2. The mention of rain (mashiv ha-ruab) is made for the last time on the first day of Passover either in Shaharit (Sefardic and Land of Israel practice) or in the silent Musaf prayer (Ashkenazic rite). 8. The received text is "Nineveh," the Assyrian city, but Samuel Klein, "The Estates of R. Judah Ha-Nasi," Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s. 2 (1911-12): 550-554, suggested reading here "Nawe," a city in Transjordan. His reasoning is that there was no Jewish community in Nineveh at the time of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. This emendation was accepted by Malter, p. 97 (1967 ed., pp. 194-195), and by Gedalyah Alon, Toledot ha-Yehudim be-'Ere; Yisrael bi-Tequfat ha-Mishnah veha-Talmud, vol. 2 (Tel Aviv, 1961), p. 138. This emendation was rejected by Jacob Obermeyer, Die Landschaft Babylonien (Frankfurt, 1929), p. 139. For our purposes, it makes no difference whether it was the Jews of Nineveh or the Jews of Nawe who</page><page sequence="4">144 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER compared to individuals and hence to include our prayer for rain in the benediction Shome'a Tefilah ["He Who Hears Prayer"],to or are we regarded as a community and should insert it in Birkat ha-Shanim? Rabbi replied: You are regarded as individuals, and should insert your prayer in the benediction Shome'a Tefilah. An objection was raised: Rabbi Judah says, the given order of fasts applies only to times when the seasons of the year were divided on the basis of their normal recurrence and Israel was dwelling in its land, but in the present [i.e., after the destruction of the Temple and the dispersion of the Jewish people] all depends upon the nature of the seasons and upon the nature of the localities! What! You quote a baraita to contradict Rabbi! Rabbi is an authority of the Mishnah and is entitled to differ. What has been decided in this matter? R. Nabman said, in such a case the prayer for rain may be in- serted in Birkat ha-Shanim, but R. Sheshet said, it must be included in Shome'a Tefilah, and the law is that it must be included in Shome'a Tefilah.II The Jerusalem Talmud reports the incident somewhat differently. As the story is presented there,'2 the inhabitants of Nineveh found themselves in dire need of rain after Passover, i.e., when the Jews in both the Land of Israel and Babylonia no longer required rain. They, therefore, wanted to call a public fast, but they were reluctant to do so without higher authority. As a result, the Jews of Nineveh came and asked Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi whether a public fast was permissible. He said: "Go and do so; just do not change the form of the prayer [mi-tiv'ah shel tefilah]."'3 On the basis of this answer, the question was then raised as to where in the Shemonah 'Esreh one actually prays for rain, i.e., says tal u-matar, under such circumstances. R. Jeremiah ruled that one says it in Shome'a Tefilah. R. Yose, however, stated that the presented this question to Rabbi Judah the Prince. We shall refer to Nineveh throughout this article, since that is the reading familiar to the medieval authorities. 9. Bi-tequfat Tammuz, i.e., during the period of the summer solstice. The term tequfah is used for both the equinox/solstice itself and the entire season. 10. See Appendix. I 1. Bab.

Many later authorities quoted Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's phrase as malbe'a shel tefilah. By itself, Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's answer is unclear. What does the "form of prayer" have to do with the rain fast? In context, however, and in comparison with Bab. Ta'anit 14b, it appears that Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi must be referring to the saying of lal u-malar.</page><page sequence="5">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 145 saying of jal u-malar in Shome'a Tefilah applies only during the period of the year when it should be said in Birkat ha-Shanim, when the worshipper has forgotten to do so.14 At other times, R. Yose argued, tal u-malar should be said only in the six extra blessings added to the Shemoneh 'Esreh on a fast-day."5 Since, however, these six additional blessings could be said only in communal prayer, R. Hanina ruled that individuals praying by them- selves would have to say tal u-malar in Shome'a Tefilah.'6 Though the two Talmuds present the incident differently, one can discern the basic story and conclusion. The climate of Nineveh was such that rain was desirable even after Passover. The Jewish community there turned to the patriarch, Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, to inquire as to the correct pro- cedure for praying for it. He answered that they might pray for rain, but not in the same manner as they would in the winter, when Jews in the Land of Israel and Babylonia were also praying for rain. The practical implication of this ruling, as expressed by R. Sheshet, R. Jeremiah, and R. Ijanina, meant that such Jews, who were to be considered as individuals, could pray for rain during the summer, but not in Birkat ha-Shanim. One must not tamper with the "form of prayer." There are, then, two possible reasons for Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's ruling. On the one hand, it may be that the Jews of Nineveh were too small a community, compared to the Jewish populations in the Land of Israel and Babylonia, to have their own special times for saying lal u-malar in Birkat ha-Shanim. On the other hand, it may be that Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi was concerned about Jewish unity as expressed by the uniformity of custom. If any group of Jews were allowed to change the form of prayer to suit local needs, the result might be fragmentation." Perhaps the logical approach would have been for each group of Jews to pray for rain, in Birkat ha- Shanim, when the need arose. Such, indeed, was the position of R. Judah (and, probably, R. NaIman): "In the present time all depends upon the 14. R. Yose's statement is based on the statement of R. Ze'eira in the name of R. Huna, quoted directly above the present passage (Jer. Ta'anit 63d). 15. See Mishnah Ta'anit 2:2-4. 16. R. IHanina based his opinion on another statement of R. Ze'eira in the name of R. Huna, Jer. Berakhot 4:4, 8b. 17. In Bab. Berakhot 40b, the possibility is raised that one might be able to substitute differ- ent formulae for the recognized blessings before food. This is objected to on the basis that one may not change the form which was ordained by the rabbis, malbe'a she-tav'u zakhamim.</page><page sequence="6">146 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER nature of the seasons and upon the nature of the localities." This, however, was not the way Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi saw the issue. Uniformity of practice outweighed what might have been considerations of logic.'" In the post-talmudic period, Jewish communities were established in countries in which the climatic patterns differed from both the Land of Israel and Babylonia. One question which naturally arose was when Jews in those lands should pray for rain. Should they follow the custom of the Land of Israel, and pray for rain from the seventh of Marbeshvan until Passover, or that of Babylonia, and say the prayer from the sixtieth day of the equinox until Passover? Inasmuch as the Talmud describes the Babylonian custom as that of the Golah (which, in context, meant Babylonia but which also means "diaspora"),'9 should the Babylonian practice be regarded as applying to all Jews outside the Land of Israel? If the local need for rain was sufficiently different from both the Land of Israel and Babylonia, were the individual Jewish communities entitled to set up their own customs? What lessons could be derived from the story about the Jews in Nineveh? What effect should climatic conditions have on the practice of praying for rain? These questions have exercised the minds of many rabbinic decisors for at least the past thousand years and, to some extent, continue to do so to this day. Our examination of the answers given to these questions will show the various underlying factors involved in halakhic development.20 18. Some commentators understood Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's answer as based on the fact that summer rain is bad for most of the world. Therefore, he would not let the inhabitants change the form of prayer to pray for something which most people wish to avoid; see, e.g., Menalhem ha-Meiri, Beit ha-Bebhirah, Ta'anit, ed. Abraham Sofer (Jerusalem, 1968/69), p. 54. Yosef Kafalb, "She'elat Geshamim," Me'orot 1 (Fall 1979): 88-92, suggested that Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi was concerned that the form of Birkat ha-Shanim said in the summer would fall into desuetude if he permitted the saying of tal u-matar in Birkat ha-Shanim other than in the winter. (This theory is based on the supposition that Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi recognized two separate forms of Birkat ha-Shanim, as is the Yemenite and Sefardic practice to this day, rather than one form of Birkat ha-Shanim, with and without tal u-matar, as is the Ashkenazic prac- tice; see n. 1.) This, to Kafab, is the meaning of the prohibition of changing the "form of prayer. 19. Bab. Ta'anit 10a, Jer. Ta'anit 63d. There are a number of talmudic passages in which Golah clearly means only Babylonia; see, e.g., Ber. 63a, Sanh. 32b, and Qid. 72a. 20. It should be clear already that the widely held belief that Jews in the diaspora pray for rain to fall in Israel is fallacious. Cf., e.g., Elie Munk, The World of Prayer, vol. 1 (New York, 1961), p. 138; Barukh Halevi Epstein, Barukh She'emar (Tel Aviv, 1970), p. 128; Mordecai M. Kaplan, Judaism as a Civilization (New York, 1934), p. 188; Ben Zion Bokser, The Prayer Book (New York, 1961), p. 54 (note); Isaac Klein, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice (New York, 1979), p. 23. Apparently, Hayyim of Volozhyn understood Joseph Caro in the Shulbtan Arukh to be of a similar opinion; cf. Zevi Kaplan, "Le-Darkho shel Rabbenu Hayyim mi-Volozhin</page><page sequence="7">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 147 The Date in North Africa and Europe There is no record of any discussions concerning the date for saying tal u-matar in the ancient non-Babylonian diaspora communities, such as Alexandria or Rome. The question seems to have arisen first in geonic times, but only among the Jews of Kairouan in what is now Tunisia, North Africa. There, according to the available evidence, the custom of the Land of Israel-beginning to pray for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan-was apparently the one followed.2' It is only from the eleventh century on, however, that accurate records of rabbinic discussions of the issue have been preserved. From the extant sources, we learn that the general practice among the Jews of Europe was to follow the Babylonian procedure of starting to say tal u-matar on the sixtieth day from the autumnal equinox. Numerous authori- ties from the eleventh to the fourteenth century attest to this fact. Whether it was in France and Germany,22 in Italy,23 or in Spain,24 the Babylonian prac- ba-Halakhah," Sinai 69 (Nisan-Elul 1970/71): 92 (and cf. his n. 43). Epstein even provided a rationale explaining why a Jew living elsewhere should pray for rain in the Land of Israel. It is based on the principle (Berakhot 12b) that he who is able to pray for his neighbor's needs and does not do so is considered a sinner. 21. The evidence is somewhat sketchy and is dependent on unreliable MS readings. See Halakhot Gedolot, ed. J. Hildesheimer (Berlin, 1888), p. 175. In the E. Hildesheimer edition (Jerusalem, 1971), p. 360, the passage in question appears only in the textual variants. See, in addition, Aryeh Leib Frumkin, ed., Seder Ray Amram Ha-Shalem (Jerusalem, 1911/12), p. 245, where reference is made to Franqia'. David Hedegard, Seder R. Amram Gaon, vol. 1 (Lund, 1951), p. 91, surmised that this means Africa. In any event, this passage is suspect since it appears only in Oxford-Bodleian MS Opp. 28, which is late and unreliable.

The commentary attributed to Rashi summed up the matter succinctly: "All our customs follow Babylonia."25 The only exception to this general rule seems to have been in Provence (Languedoc), although the evidence is conflicting. Some authorities say unqualifiedly that in Provence the custom was to begin saying tal u-matar on the sixtieth day from the equinox.26 Most of our sources, however, point to a different practice, namely, beginning the request for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan.27 Most of the evidence for the Provencal custom comes from the city of Narbonne.28 We see, then, that in regard to the prayer for rain, Jewry in North Africa and Western Europe can be divided into two groups, those who followed the Vienna, Or Zaru'a, vol. 2 (Zhitomir, 1862/63), p. 163; Moses of Coucy, Sefer Mitzvot Gadol Positive Commandment 19 (Venice, 1546/47; reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1960/61), p. 100b; Abraham ben Nathan of Lunel, Ha-Manhig, p. 90; and Asher ben Jehiel, Sefer She'elot u-Teshuvot ha-Rosh (n.p., n.d.), p. 14. 23.

We do not know, however, the origins of these particular practices. Was the adoption of either custom the result of a conscious decision-based on talmudic texts or other halakhic or meteorological considera- tions29-or do the various practices reflect merely the origins of the first Jewish settlers in each country?30 When the author of the commentary attributed to Rashi stated in this matter that "all our customs follow Babylonia,"3' was he instituting a new law or simply codifying an already existing practice? There is no way of answering these questions, since Jewish settlement in these areas predated our earliest surviving halakhic documents by several centuries,32 and since the documents we have do not address these issues. What we can say is that the divergence in practice in the first cen- turies of the second millennium C.E. mirrors the divergence in the halakhic decisions on the matter from that period. Just as there was no one diaspora custom regarding tal u-matar, there was also no one authoritative exposi- tion of the halakhah on this issue. As the halakhah developed, local custom played a decisive role in the forming of the law. In turn, the halakhah 29. In Tunisia, there is rain all year round, though very little in June through August. The rainy season begins in September, and the months of heaviest rainfall are October to January; see J. F. Griffiths, ed., Climates of Africa, World Survey of Climatology, no. 10 (Amsterdam, 1972), p. 74. Provence (Languedoc), likewise, is relatively dry from June to August, with September through December being the wettest period of the year; see C. C. Wall6n, Climates of Northern and Western Europe, World Survey of Climatology, 5 (Amsterdam, 1970), pp. 189-190. These Jewish communities, therefore, would seem to be justified, from the point of view of climate, in beginning the pray for rain in Marbeshvan. 30. The settlement of Jews in southern France goes back at least to the first century. There was an especial interest in the Jerusalem Talmud in Provence; see Abraham ibn Daud, Sefer ha-Qabbalah, ed, and trans. by Gerson D. Cohen, (Philadelphia, 1967), pp. 66 (Hebrew), 88-89 (translation); Louis Ginzberg, A Commentary on the Palestinian Talmud (New York, 1941), pp. 109-110 (in introduction). This interest in the Jerusalem Talmud may have been one of the factors which led to the basing of Provengal customs on the practices of both the Land of Israel and Babylonia; see B. Z. Benedikt, "Le-Toledotav shel Merkaz ha-Torah be-Provence," Tarbi; 22 (1950/51): 93. Jews in North Africa also had customs from both the Land of Israel and Babylonia; see H. Z. Hirschberg, A History of the Jews in North Africa, vol. 1 (Leiden, 1974), pp. 298-300. Spain had an ancient Jewish community, most of which was wiped out before the Muslim conquest (711). During the Muslim period, the Jewish community was very much under Babylonian influence; cf. Eliyahu Ashtor, "Spain," Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 15, col. 222. In general, not enough is known about halakhic developments in Europe during the first millennium C.E. to come to any definite conclusions about the different customs of saying lal u-malar. 31.

LASKER determined the customs that subsequently developed in other communities. To understand this process, we must turn to the authorities whose rulings were most decisive for the final adjudication of the question. The first postgeonic codification of the halakhah was compiled by Isaac Alfasi (1031-1103). In his Hilkhot ha-Rif, Alfasi recorded the opinions of Hananiah, who said that the prayer for rain in the Golah begins on the sixtieth day from the equinox, and of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, concerning praying for rain in Nineveh, without any discussion. It would appear, then, that Alfasi believed that the entire diaspora should follow the Babylonian practice.3 Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides, 1135-1204) was the first authority to offer the possibility that each locality should pray for rain when it is needed there, rather than follow the practice of either the Land of Israel or of Baby- lonia. Unfortunately, his opinion on the matter is ambiguous, since the point of view in his Commentary on the Mishnah seems to differ from that found in his Mishneh Torah. In the Commentary on the Mishnah, Maimoni- des wrote: In the other countries [i.e., other than the Land of Israel] the request [for rain] is at a time when rain is good and proper in that place, and that time is consi- dered as if it were the seventh of Marbeshvan, and if rain is delayed after that time, one should react in regard to the fasts as has been prescribed.34 For there are countries in which rain begins only in Nisan [March/April] and countries which have summer in Marbeshvan; and rain, instead of being good for them, kills and destroys them. How can people in such a place ask for rain in Marbeshvan? Would that not be both a lie and foolishness? This is true and obvious.35 A very different view is given when Maimonides comes to codify the 33. Hilkhot ha-Rif, pp. 2a, 5a (standard Vilna Talmud ed.). 34. The first three chapters of Ta'anit give instructions for the public fasts to be held in the event of a drought. What Maimonides seems to be saying here is that Jews in a country that needs rain as of the first of Nisan, for example, would begin to say lal u-malar on that date. (Since he does not specify the benediction in which it is said, that became the subject of later debate; see below.) They would also institute fasts for a drought as if the first of Nisan were the seventh of Marbeshvan. Thus, since in the Land of Israel individuals begin to fast on the seventeenth of Marheshvan (Ta'anit 1:4), in this particular country they would begin on the eleventh of Nisan. 35. Commentary on the Mishnah, ad Ta'anit 1:3.</page><page sequence="11">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 151 halakhah in the Mishneh Torah. Here, without any reference to what appears in the Commentary, he wrote: One begins to ask for rain in the Blessing of the Years from the seventh of Marheshvan [and continues] during the whole period of mentioning rain [until Passover]. This refers only to the Land of Israel, but Shinar [Babylonia], Syria, Egypt, and places near them and like them ask for rain on the sixtieth day from the autumnal equinox. Places that need rain in the summer, such as the faraway sea islands, ask for rain when they need it in Shome'a Tefilah.36 As we shall see below, later authorities tried to explain Maimonides' two statements in different ways.37 It may well be that any apparent contradic- tion is a result of the different purposes of the two works discussed here.38 In his Commentary, Maimonides was explaining the import of the Mishnah; therefore, he felt free to explore the logic of the situation: "How can people in such a place ask for rain in Marheshvan? Would that not be both a lie and foolishness? This is true and obvious." When he codified the law in the Mishneh Torah, however, he appears to be constrained by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's response to the residents of Nineveh. What may be logically sound, or even the correct interpretation of the Mishnah, is not necessarily codified as the halakhah. Whatever Maimonides' true intentions, the issue was left unresolved. He did, however, provide a basis for those who subse- quently ruled that the prayer for rain should follow local needs and not be said simply according to the Babylonian practice. In Maimonides' work, the tensions between logic and tradition were not yet explicit. This conflict is more clearly expressed by Yom Tov ben Abraham Ishbili (Ritba, ca. 1250-1330). In his fliddushim to Ta'anit, he started off by interpreting Rabban Gamaliel's statement in the Mishnah to mean that the prayer for rain was delayed until the seventh of Marbeshvan because of the pilgrims, but that the appropriate time to begin the prayer, if there are no pilgrims, is right after Shemini Atzeret. He further noted the talmudic passage which attributes the late date for the prayer for rain in 36. H. Tefilah 2:16-17. 37. On the problem of contradictions in the Mishneh Torah itself, see Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New Haven, 1980), pp. 311-320. 38. On the distinction Maimonides himself made between a commentary (perush) and a code (hibbur), see Chaim Tchernowitz, Toledoth Ha-Poskim, vol. 1 (New York, 1946), pp. 242-243.</page><page sequence="12">152 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER Babylonia to the presence there of peirei be-davra' ("fruits in the field").39 He, therefore, deduced from the Talmud that there are two possible starting dates for saying tal u-matar: (1) right after Shemini Atzeret, as in the Land of Israel,40 or (2) sixty days from the autumnal equinox, as in Babylonia. Which of these two alternatives should apply to any particular community, he continued, depends on two factors. If the climate is like that of the Land of Israel, and if there are ho fruits in the field, then the date for beginning to say tal u-matar should be right after Shemini Atzeret. If, however, unlike the Land of Israel, a community does not need rain until much later than Shemini Atzeret or has fruits in the field that would be damaged by the rain, the Babylonian date should be observed. Ritba noted, however, that the geonim and Alfasi had ruled that all diaspora communities, regardless of their own requirements, should follow the Babylonian custom. Therefore, Ritba concluded, even though those diaspora communities which begin to request rain right after Shemini Atzeret have a good custom and a correct approach (minhag yafeh ve-shillah nekhonah), they have no right to disagree with the geonim. As to those communities which begin saying lal u-malar on the seventh of Mar- beshvan,4' Ritba stated that they are completely wrong. Ritba had one more problem he wished to solve. If his interpretation of the Talmud was correct, why did the geonim rule as they did? He explained that they required all diaspora Jews to follow the Babylonian custom, despite what the Talmud actually taught, for these three reasons: (1) all other diaspora matters ('inyanim) follow Babylonia; (2) all the diaspora should have one custom (understanding HIananiah's statement about the Golah to refer to all diaspora countries); and (3) rain immediately after Shemini Atzeret could damage the produce in the fields.42 39. The concept of "produce in the field (peirei be-davra')" is derived from Ta'anit 4b. For its meaning in the talmudic context, see the authors' "The Jewish Prayer for Rain in Baby- lonia." Ritba said that communities which have produce in the field after Shemini Atzeret but need rain before sixty days from the equinox could pray for it in Shome'a Tefilah, but the custom is not to do so; see Appendix. 40. For the possibility that when there is no Temple, the prayer for rain should begin in the Land of Israel right after Shemini Atzeret, see above, n. 3. Isaiah di Trani the Younger was also of the opinion that in post-Temple times, lal u-matar in the Land of Israel is said right after Shemini Atzeret; see Pisqei Riaz, p. 91. For Nissim ben Reuben's opinion, see below, n. 53. 41. The text reads the "fifteenth" of Marbeshvan (obviously influenced from "fifteen days after the feast"). 42. See Hliddushei ha-Rilba, pp. 36-40. Ritba lived in Seville (as his name Ishbili shows), and, as we have seen, standard Spanish practice was to follow the Babylonian custom (as Ritba</page><page sequence="13">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 153 Ritba was torn between two conflicting aims. On the one hand, he wished to make the halakhah conform with the talmudic teachings as he understood them. After all, correct practice should follow from correct interpretation of the Talmud. On the other hand, he recognized the authori- ty of the geonim and Alfasi. A ruling which contradicted the later rabbis, even if in perfect accord with the intention of the Talmud, would undermine Jewish unity. Reluctantly, Ritba decided that a uniform halakhah is, in a sense, of greater value than a correct halakhah. He, therefore, ruled that all diaspora Jews must begin their prayer for rain on the sixtieth day from the equinox, in accordance with the Babylonian practice. Menabem ben Solomon ha-Meiri (1249-1316) and Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh, ca. 1250-1327) were aware of the same conflicting values. The former was a Provenqal, and he supported the local practice of starting the prayer for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan. Though Meiri recognized the opinion that all the diaspora should follow the Babylonian procedures, he pointed out that there was another, equally legitimate point of view, namely, that the Babylonian custom was to be followed only if it were meteorologi- cally relevant. In a country which needed rain before the sixtieth day from the equinox, the practice of the Land of Israel should be followed. This was the theoretical justification for the Provencal custom.43 The other authority who supported the principle that rain should be requested when rain is needed was Asher ben Jehiel. Indeed, he was the most determined protagonist of that point of view, the only medieval authority for whom this question became a matter of personal prestige. In a respon- sum occasioned by a drought in Spain in 5073 (1313), and written during Hlol ha-Mo'ed Passover of that year,44 he described efforts he had made in this direction over a long period of time. himself admitted). His knowledge of Provenqal customs may have been second-hand. In any case, there is no other evidence that some communities in Europe or North Africa began the prayer for rain right after Shemini Atzeret. Ritba's opinion that in some diaspora countries one begins saying lal u-malar right after Shemini Atzeret may have been influenced by his teacher Aaron ben Joseph Halevi (Sefer Pequdat Ha-Leviim [Jerusalem, 1961/62], Ta'anit sec., p. 4), who, however, was equivocal and said only that this appears to him to be the correct custom. Ritba's own opinion about beginning tal u-malar at the conclusion of Shemini Atzeret was followed by Joseph ibn IHabiba (Nimuqei Yosef, ed. E. Lichtenstein [Petah Tiqva, 1977/78], pp. 11-12). 43. Beit ha-Behirah, pp. 33-34. Meiri was familiar with the view (presumably Ritba's) that the prayer for rain should begin right after Shemini Atzeret. He claimed that this opinion was not applicable in Provence because of the "fruit in the field"; see above, n. 39. 44. Rosh apologized at the end of the responsum for writing during Ilol ha-Mo'ed, which</page><page sequence="14">154 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER In his native Germany, Rosh had felt that rain was necessary from the middle of Tishrei to Shavuot, and that it was especially needed in the early fall-before the sixtieth day from the equinox-to protect the newly sown seeds from being eaten by rats and chickens.45 He, therefore, had argued with his Jewish countrymen there against the practice of limiting the prayer for rain to the period from the sixtieth day from the equinox to Passover. He agreed that, in general, Babylonian practice is normative for diaspora Jews, but he held that this principle applies only to laws of forbidden things, obli- gations and exemptions, and ritual cleanliness. In regard to laws related to climatic conditions, he insisted that the rules to be followed should be deter- mined by the local climate, not by the Babylonian precedent. Rosh, therefore, urged his fellow German Jews to pray for rain between the seventh of Marbeshvan and Shavuot by inserting the words tal u-matar in the Blessing of the Years at that time. When confronted with Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's instructions to the inhabitants of Nineveh that they should say their prayer only in Shome'a Tefilah, he responded that the two situations were different. Nineveh was only a city; Germany was a whole country.46 Since the entire country needed rain at a time other than the traditional period, the Jews there were within their rights to incorporate the prayer into the Birkat ha-Shanim. None of Rosh's fellow German Jews disputed his reasoning, since they recognized the logic of his position. Nevertheless, they refused to listen to his recommendations that they change their custom. Their opposition to such a change was reinforced by the fact that often their major meteorologi- cal problem was too much rain, not too little. Passing through Provence on his way from Germany to Spain (in 1303), Rosh faced a somewhat different situation. There he was pleased to learn that the Jews in Montpellier began saying tal u-matar on the seventh of was against his custom. Since, however, the matter was so pressing, and since there are elements of the responsum that dealt with the holiday, he made an exception in this case. 45. Abraham Sofer offered an explanation in the name of his father, Simeon Sofer, of why German Jews did not respond to Rosh's arguments. Since in Germany rain was not intrinsical- ly necessary, but was desired in order to keep the rats and chickens away from the seeds, one could do without rain. Instead, one could put up scarecrows to achieve the same end; cf. Meiri, Beit ha-Bethirah, p. 34, n. 2. This explanation appears in a slightly different form in Simeon Sofer, Hit'orerut ha-Teshuvah, vol. 1, printed with Moses Sofer (Schreiber), Sefer -.atam Sofer, vol. 7 (Munkaics, 1912), p. 87a. 46. Cf. also Hilkhot ha-Rosh ad Ta'anit 14b.</page><page sequence="15">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 155 Marheshvan. When he was told, however, that they stopped saying it at Passover, he asked whether this was because they had no need for rain after that time. When they answered that, indeed, they did need rain, Rosh repeated to them the position he had taken with the German Jews, i.e., that the Jews of each country should ask for rain when they need it. The Pro- vencal reaction was similar to the German reaction, namely, that Rosh's logic was sound, but custom is custom. The earliest scholars had established the dates for saying tal u-malar and only a synod of sages could change things. Rosh moved on without knowing the final disposition of the matter.47 When he reached Spain, Rosh saw that the need for rain there was even greater than in Germany or Provence. Though he mentioned to his col- leagues several times that they ought to ask for rain between Passover and Shavuot, he did not make a public issue of it at the time so as not to change the local custom. This brings us to the year 1313, when he wrote his responsum on the subject. Because of the drought referred to above, Spanish Jews were fasting for rain and saying special prayers on Sabbaths and holidays. Now, he thought, was a propitious time to bring about the change he wanted. If he could convince Spanish Jews to say lal u-malar this year until Shavuot, he felt, they would find the practice agreeable and continue it in following years. So, once again Rosh tried to convince a group of Jews to follow the logic of the situation rather than custom. This time he invoked the words of Maimonides, who, as we have seen, is not altogether clear on the issue. Rosh argued that, according to Maimoni- des' Commentary on the Mishnah, when a "whole country," such as Ger- many or Spain, has a particular need for rain, it may create its own custom as to when to say tal u-malar. While he looked to Maimonides' Commentary for support for his position, he was not dissuaded by the apparent limitation to be found in the Mishneh Torah, namely, "Places that need rain in the summer, such as faraway sea islands," were required to say the prayer in Shome'a Tefilah, but he argued that Maimonides would permit "whole countries" to say it in Birkat ha-Shanim. Thus, there was no contradiction between the Commentary and the Mishneh Torah. The former dealt with whole countries and could be used to justify a separate German or Spanish 47. Cf. Hilkhot ha-Rosh ad Ta'anit 1Oa and Tur's quotation of him, Orah Ilayyim 117.</page><page sequence="16">156 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER custom; the latter referred only to individuals, such as those who lived in Nineveh.48 The reception given Rosh's opinion in Spain was the same as that given it by the German and Provenqal Jews. In his own words, "The heart of the community was unwilling to accept the words of the living God." In this responsum, Rosh took a strong stand for an interpretation of the Talmud, and, thereby, a determination of the halakhah, based on the logic of the situation rather than on accumulated local custom. It is not surprising that he met stiff resistance to his ruling, for Rosh's logic led him to some daring conclusions. When he ruled that German Jews could pray for rain before the date set by Babylonian precedent, he at least had the practice of the Land of Israel on his side. When, however, he permitted the prayer to be said until Shavuot,49 he had no explicit talmudic basis at all. True, he made reference to the case of Nineveh, but he regarded the ruling of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi as irrelevant to his circumstances. He invoked the authority of Maimonides, but only to the extent that the latter's view supported his own. Other earlier authorities, such as the geonim and Alfasi, were ignored completely. Rosh's attempt, here, was to have the halakhah fit the meteorological and agricultural conditions of each country. It was an uphill battle, and he lost it. The German Jews, though they could not dispute his logic, claimed that they already had too much rain. The Provenqal Jews felt that only an authorized synod could make such a momentous decision as continuing tal u-matar until Shavuot. In Spain, where some of his colleagues agreed with him, his opponents were able to convince the community not to "accept the words of the living God." Finally, Rosh gave up and accepted the inevitable, that logic is not enough to change practices which are deeply rooted in tradition. He also realized that the need for uniformity is as important a principle on which to base halakhah as are logic and a correct interpretation of authoritative texts. Therefore, to preserve communal unity, he decided against implementing his decision even in his own synagogue.50 48. Even if Rosh's interpretation of Maimonides concerning the request for rain (tal u-malar) is correct, he seems to have gone beyond Maimonidean boundaries by advocating the continuation of the mention of rain (mashiv ha-ruah) until Shavuot. This practice has no basis in the works of earlier authorities. 49. And the mention of rain; see above, n. 48. 50. This story is told in Teshuvot ha-Rosh 4:10, pp. 14-15. The fact that Rosh did not pray in the main synagogue may indicate that, even before this incident, he already had difficulties</page><page sequence="17">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 157 It is ironic that the very greatness of Rosh's reputation played a major role in crystallizing Jewish practice along lines which he opposed. As some later authorities pointed out, if Rosh was unable to change the custom, no one could.51 Even his own son, Jacob ben Asher (Tur, ca. 1270-1340), though he quoted his father's opinion, ruled that the saying of tal u-matar getting along with his community. In fact, the whole account hints at the complicated relation- ship which Rosh and his allies had with the general Jewish populace. This interesting responsum (which, of course, is not really a responsum because there is no question that was the cause of its issuance) provides insights also into both Rosh's halakhic method and his ability to compromise. He was an independent thinker, but he lacked the aggressiveness to fight for his point of view; he was willing to show flexibility to avoid open conflict. See the description of Rosh and his activities provided by Ephraim E. Urbach, Encyclopedia Hebraica, vol. 7 (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1953/54), pp. 443-446 (trans., Encyclo- paedia Judaica, 2: 706-708). For Rosh's opposition to the use of logic per se, divorced from the halakhic process and authoritative texts, see Teshuvot ha-Rosh 55:9, pp. 103-105. 51. Cf., e.g., Joseph Caro in Beit Yosef on Tur, Orah fIayyim 117; Jehiel Michel Epstein, Arukh ha-Shulfian, Orah H.ayyim 117:4 (Piotrkow, 1902/3 [reprint ed.,]), p. 202; Zevi Pesat Frank, Sefer Har Zevi, Orah N.ayyim 1 (Jerusalem, 1968/69), p. 56. Though Rosh's principle that each country has its own proper date for lal u-malar was rejected, his arguments were not totally in vain. This can be seen by a perusal of the responsa literature on the subject of whether a person who says tal u-malar at the wrong time must repeat the Shemoneh 'Esreh. If a person asks for rain in the summer in a country that does not need rain, it is clear that he must repeat his prayer. What, though, of someone who asks for rain during the summer in a country that does need rain then, or after the seventh of Marbeshvan and before the sixtieth day of the equinox in a country which needs rain at that time? Relying on Rosh, most authorities have ruled that such a person does not have to repeat the Shemoneh Esreh, even though there are many different opinions on this question. For the various points of view, see Caro, Beit Yosef, on Tur, Orab Hayyim 117 (quoting Isaac Aboab, his teacher), and Shulban Arukh, Orabh Hayyim 117:2, and cf. Moses Isserles, ad loc.; David Ibn Abi Zimra, She'elot u-Teshuvot ha-Radbaz, vol. 6 (Warsaw, 1882; reprint ed., New York, 1967), p. 2; Jacob Castro, Ohalei Ya'aqov (Livorno, 1783), pp. 135b-136a; Moshe Mat, Malleh Moshe, ed.

The impression is left that Rosh's opinion should be the halakhah but, nonetheless, is not followed. This is said clearly by Moshe Feinstein, Iggerot Moshe, Orahb Hayyim 2 (New York, 1963), p. 293. We see here the seriousness with which the rabbis treat prayer. The assumption is that if one prays for rain, God will send it. Therefore, if the worshipper asks for it at the wrong time, he had better repeat the Shemoneh 'Esreh, this time omitting the prayer for rain lest God send rain at an inopportune time. This is the reason also for waiting fifteen days after Sukkot before saying tal u-malar in the Land of Israel when there are pilgrims returning home. If one prays for rain earlier, it will come earlier, when not wanted.</page><page sequence="18">158 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER should start on the sixtieth day from the equinox and should stop with Passover.52 This is not to imply that, from the time of Rosh's admission of failure, all Jewish communities outside the Land of Israel followed the Babylonian practice. When Nissim ben Reuben of Gerona (Ran, ca. 1310-ca.1375) wrote his Commentary on Alfasi's Hilkhot ha-Rif, he recorded the fact that some diaspora communities followed the practice of beginning the recita- tion of tal u-matar on the seventh of Marbeshvan. From a theoretical point of view, he was sympathetic with this procedure, but practically he could not approve of it. Ran, like Ritba, gave evidence of a conflict between what he considered to be the correct interpretation of the Talmud and what the tradi- tion maintained as the halakhah. Thus, Ran explained the Talmud as presenting three different dates for beginning tal u-matar: (1) In the Land of Israel when there are no pilgrims, and in other countries that have similar climatic conditions and do not have produce in the fields, the prayer should begin right after Shemini Atzeret. (2) In the Land of Israel when there is a Temple, and thus there are pilgrims, and in other countries that have similar climatic conditions but do have produce in the field, the prayer should begin on the seventh of Marheshvan. (3) In Babylonia, and countries like it, the prayer should begin on the sixtieth day from the equinox. As Ran saw it, then, the Talmud supports the procedure of the Provenqal Jews. His problem, though, was that his predecessors, Alfasi and Maimoni- des, limited the seventh of Marbeshvan to the Land of Israel and prescribed the sixtieth day from the equinox for all other countries. Neither of them considered the day after Shemini Atzeret as appropriate for any place. Ran, like Ritba before him, finally concluded that his own interpretation of the Talmud, logical as he felt it was, must yield to the authority of these earlier decisors.53 We have no records as to what finally happened among the Provenqal Jews. They may very well have continued following the practice of the Land 52. Tur, Ora h Hayyim 117. He is followed by David ben Joseph Abudarham, Sefer Abudarham (Amsterdam, 1725/26), p. 41a. 53. See Ran's Commentary on Hilkhot ha-Rif, Ta'anit, p. 2a (s.v. ve-'ika le-meidaq). Ran suggested that Rif's and Maimonides' codification of starting /al u-malar in the Land of Israel on the seventh of Marl.eshvan was based on the fact that there were pilgrims to Jerusalem even after the destruction of the Temple. On this subject, see Shmuel Safrai, "Pilgrimage to Jerusalem after the Destruction of the Second Temple" (Hebrew), in Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period: Abraham Schalit Memorial Volume, ed. A.

It is possible that the Jews of North Africa, at least in certain areas, also continued to follow the custom of the Land of Israel. Both Simon ben Zema1h Duran (Rashbaz, 1361-1444) in Algiers"5 and David ben Solomon Ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz, 1479-1573) in Egypt56 mentioned that some diaspora communities began asking for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan. Neither, however, stated that this was the practice in his own community, or that this custom was specifically North African. The last place in the diaspora where we hear of the prayer for rain being said from the seventh of Marlheshvan is Tunisia. In the nineteenth century, there were reports of this practice in Tunis and Djerba.57 54. Though the Jews were never completely expelled from Provence proper, they were forced to leave many of the cities mentioned here (which are actually in Languedoc). There is some confusion between Provence and Languedoc because the Jewish sources mention the former when referring to the latter; see Bernhard Blumenkranz, s.v. "Provence," Encyclopaedia Judaica, 13: 1259, and idem, s.v. "Languedoc," EJ, 10: 1421-22. 55. See Sefer Tashbe;, vol. 3 (Lemberg, 1891 [reprint ed.]), pp. 21a-b. 56. She'elot u-Teshuvot (n. 51), p. 2. It is unclear from their responsa whether Duran and Ibn Abi Zimra had first-hand knowledge of such practices or whether they were reporting what was written by earlier authorities. If the latter is true, there is no proof that any diaspora communities, let alone North African ones, were beginning to say tal u-matar on the seventh of Marbeshvan in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 57. Hlayyim Palache (1788-1869), Argot ha-Uayyim (Jerusalem, 1876/77), p. 42b, stated that he had heard that it was the custom of the Jews of Tunis and Djerba to begin the prayer for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan. He suggested that this custom might have stemmed from the visit of a Jew from the Land of Israel. He surmised that the visitor, when repeating the Shemoneh 'Esreh while leading the congregational service, followed his usual practice of saying tal u-malar after the seventh of Marbeshvan. The Tunisian Jews, because of their great love for the Land of Israel, imitated his practice. Palache apparently did not realize that this procedure may simply have been the long-standing North African custom of beginning the prayer for rain on the seventh of Marbeshvan, mentioned above. If this is the case, we see here another example of the tenacity of custom. Palache stated further that, even if the Tunisian custom originated according to his hypothesis, the visitor from the Land of Israel should not have instituted such a change in the public worship. He also expressed surprise that the learned rabbis of Tunisia allowed such a practice. He concluded that the rabbis' silence was a result of the great need for rain in Tunisia at the earlier date. See also Palache's Sefer Ruab Hayyim (Izmir, 1880/81), Ora b Htayyim 117, p. 24a. Abraham Rapoport, Quntras be-'Inyan Zeman She'elat Geshamim be-Virkat ha-Shanim be-ug;ah la-'Are; (London, 1963/64), p. 15, suggested that no diaspora community should follow the practice of the Land of Israel, even if there are similar meteorological conditions, because the date in the Land of Israel itself is a matter of dispute when there is no Temple; see above, n. 3.</page><page sequence="20">160 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER Divergent practices concerning tal u-matar continued for a number of centuries, since, as the rulings mentioned above show, the halakhah remained in flux. It may well be that Joseph Caro (1488-1575), who attempted to give a final ruling on all halakhic questions, sought to settle once and for all this issue as well.58 He discussed the prayer for rain in his three major halakhic works, the Beit Yosef (commentary on the Tur), the Kesef Mishneh (commentary on the Mishneh Torah), and the Shulban A rukh. In the Tur, as noted above, Jacob ben Asher quoted his father's opinion about European countries whose climate differs from Babylonia, but he rejected it. Caro, commenting on the Tur in his Beit Yosef, also quoted Rosh's responsum at length but stated that this opinion was not accepted, although he did not explain why this is so.59 In the Kesef Mishneh, Caro was more specific, attacking Rosh's inter- pretation of Maimonides. According to Caro, the apparent discrepancy between the Commentary on the Mishnah and the Mishneh Torah is not to be interpreted as implying a distinction between whole countries, on the one hand, and cities or "faraway sea islands," on the other. Rather, in the Commentary, Maimonides laid down the principle that areas that need rain in the summer should pray for it then. In the Mishneh Torah, Caro argued, Maimonides indicated where in the prayers such a summer request should be made. Caro added that Rosh was wrong to state that European Jews should recite tal u-matar in Birkat ha-Shanim at any time other than between the sixtieth day from the equinox and Passover.60 In the Shulban Arukh, Caro codified his opinion in terse fashion: "One 58. For Caro's attempts to offer final decisions on halakhic questions, see Isadore Twersky, "The Shulban 'Aruk: Enduring Code of Jewish Law," in Faith and Reason, ed. R. Gordis and R. B. Waxman (New York, 1973), pp. 141-158. 59. Beit Yosef on Tur, Orahb Hayyim 117. Caro pointed out that even Rosh himself could not get his view accepted. 60. Kesef Mishneh ad H. Tefilah 2:17. Another interpretation was provided by Eleazar Rokeal (18th cent.) in Turei Even, ad loc. Yosef Kafab used another approach entirely in arguing that there is no contradiction between the two works of Maimonides. According to his view, Maimonides referred in his Commentary on the Mishnah to countries where winter and summer (i.e., rainy and dry seasons) are completely opposite those seasons in Israel. In the Mishneh Torah, he referred to countries that need rain in summer in addition to their need for rain in the winter. See Kafab, "She'elat Geshamim" (n. 18), pp. 88-92. If Kafab is correct, it would seem that Maimonides would have solved the later halakhic problem of Jews who lived in the Southern Hemisphere by ruling that they should say gal u-malar in Birkat ha-Shanim in their winter; see below.</page><page sequence="21">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 161 begins to request rain in the diaspora [be-zug;ah la-are;] in the evening prayer of the sixtieth day from the autumnal equinox."61 This ruling seems to have been decisive for European and North African Jewry. Even those who questioned the authority of the Shulfhan A rukh, e.g., Mordecai ben Abraham Jaffe (Levush, ca. 1535-1612)62 and Joel Sirkes (Bayit fladash, 1561-1610),63 accepted this decision. Jaffe added that even if the entire diaspora needs rain before the sixtieth of the equinox, one may not change from the Babylonian practice. Finally, Jehiel Michel Epstein (A rukh ha-Shulbhan, 1829-1908) went so far as to say that the community's rejection of Rosh's opinion is as if a divine voice (bat qol) had come down and announced that one is to follow the Babylonian custom. Epstein added that anyone who doubts that this is the law should be punished.64 The desire for Jewish unity in the diaspora had carried the day. The Date in the Southern Hemisphere This, however, is not the end of the story. The migration of Jews to new climes, far from the old centers of Jewish habitation, reopened the ques- tion of when to pray for rain. Not all migrations had this effect. East European Jewish communities, having been settled by Jews from Central Europe, where the climate was more or less similar to that found in their new homes, simply carried on the familiar (Babylonian) practice. Apparently, the first Jewish immigrants to North America also followed the same procedure. No consideration was taken of the actual need for precipitation in the various sections of Eastern Europe or North America.65 61. Shulbhan Arukh, Orab lUayyim 117:1. Cf. also 117:2, where Caro specifically rejected Rosh's opinion and referred to Nineveh as an 'ir gedolah ("large city"). 62.

Since Rosh could not convince his fellow Jews of the rightness of his position, it follows that the halakhah should not be according to his view. Epstein's vehemence may have been the result of Reform innova- tions. Abraham Geiger had decided that since Germany has rain all year long, both the men- tion of rain and the prayer for rain should be said in all seasons; see Jacob Levinger, s.v. "Abraham Geiger," Encyclopedia Hebraica 10: 639 (Jerusalem, 1954/55). 65. Some early non-Orthodox American prayerbook compilers seem to have adopted</page><page sequence="22">162 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER Other Jewish migrants faced entirely different climatic conditions in their new homes. The first Jewish settlers in the New World came to South America, south of the equator, where they found the seasons reversed from those to which they had been accustomed. The Northern Hemisphere's winter (i.e., the months between Tishrei and Nisan) was summer, and the north's summer (i.e., the months from Nisan to Tishrei) was winter. Hence, when Jews began to settle in Recife, Brazil, in 1637, determining when to recite the prayer for rain was one of their first ritual problems. They sent their inquiry to Hayyim Shabbetai (before 1555-1647) of Salonika. This was the first halakhic question to come from the New World;66 in the 350 years since then, the problem has been raised again and again. When we analyze the various halakhic solutions to the questions about the prayer for rain in the Southern Hemisphere, we see again the same arguments that had played a part in the discussions in the Northern Hemisphere. On the one hand, there is the logic of the situation. In Maimonides' words, "How can people in such a place ask for rain in Marh.eshvan? Would that not be both a lie and foolishness? This is true and obvious."67 Jews in the Land of Israel and Babylonia prayed for rain when it was necessary for them; should not Jews in the Southern Hemisphere do the same? On the other hand, there was the weight of tradition and precedent. Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi had ruled that the Jews of Nineveh could pray for rain in the summer only in Shome'a Tefilah,68 and Alfasi,69 Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah,70 and Joseph Caro71' had codified this decision as appli- cable to all Jews. Rosh had attempted to establish the principle that Jews in each country could decide when the prayer for rain would be most effica- cious according to their own meteorological and agricultural conditions; he was not successful.72 That Rosh had failed to breach the walls of tradition Geiger's innovation (above, n. 64). Since rain falls in America year-round, they must have felt that the prayer for rain was always appropriate. See, e.g., L. Merzbacher and S. Adler, The Order of Prayer (New York, 1881), p. 68; and Benjamin Szold and Marcus Jastrow, 'Avodat Israel, vol. I (Philadelphia, 1907), p. 152. In the newest Reform prayerbook, Gates of Prayer, ed. Chaim Stern (New York, 1975), pp. 40, 64, only ve-ten berakhah (the summer formula) appears. 66. See Arnold Wiznitzer, Jews in Colonial Brazil (New York, 1960), pp. 66-67.

As we analyze the various responsa dealing with the prayer for rain in the Southern Hemisphere, we shall see the ongoing ten- sions between logic and tradition and between local custom and the desire for Jewish unity. When the Jews of Recife wrote to IHayyim Shabbetai, they informed him that they needed rain from Nisan to Tishrei (summer in the Land of Israel and in Europe, but winter in Brazil). Furthermore, they wrote, rain from Tishrei to Nisan (winter in the Northern Hemisphere, but summer in Brazil) would be harmful to them.73 What, then, would be the correct procedure for them to follow in such climatic conditions? Ijayyim Shabbetai answered by analyzing the two statements of Maimonides (in the Commentary on the Mishnah and in the Mishneh Torah) and Rosh's noteworthy responsum on the issue. He concluded that Rosh had misunderstood Maimonides when he interpreted him as ruling that if rain is needed in "a whole country" during the summer months, it is proper to ask for it in Birkat ha-Shanim. The correct interpretation, Shabbetai explained, was that prayers for rain may be said from Nisan to Tishrei if it is needed then, but only in Shome'a Tefilah (as per the Mishneh Torah). He continued, though, that one should not pray for rain when it is harmful for him (as per the Commentary on the Mishnah).74 Therefore, Shabbetai ruled, the Jews of Brazil should never, at any time of the year, pray for rain (tal u-matar) in Birkat ha-Shanim. Furthermore, they should not even "men- tion" rain, i.e., recite the words mashiv ha-ruah u-morid ha-geshem in the second benediction of the Shemoneh 'Esreh, the whole year through. During their winter, however, the Jews of Recife might pray for rain in Shome'a Tefilah if they needed it." 73. Recife has had, over a period of fifty years in the twentieth century, an average monthly rainfall during the months from March to August (its rainy season) of 8.7 inches. From September to February, the monthly average is 1.8 inches. At least in the present century there are distinct rainy and dry seasons (even though Nisan and Tishrei are not the months that mark them off from each other). It should be noted, however, that the summer there is not completely dry, since there is some rain then. Cf. U.S. Department of Commerce, Climates of the World (Washington, D.C., 1972), p. 12; and Werner Schwerdtfeger, ed., Climates of Central and South America, World Survey of Climatology, no. 12 (Amsterdam, 1976), pp. 244-251, 277. 74. Shabbetai's interpretation of Maimonides is essentially the same as Caro's in the Kesef Mishneh, although he claims to have seen the latter work only after having come to his own conclusion independently. 75. Torat Hayyim (n. 51), pp. 2a-3a; and see Appendix. On the subject of mashiv ha-ruab, see above, nn. 4, 7, 48, 49. Even though mashiv ha-ruab constituted only "mentioning" and not "praying" for rain, Shabbetai obviously felt, in line with Mishnah Ta'anit 1:1, that one does not even mention rain when it is unwanted.</page><page sequence="24">164 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER In his responsum, Shabbetai obviously chose a middle path. On the one hand, he could not authorize the Jews in Recife to say tal u-malar in the Blessing of the Years during their winter (his own summer) because tradi- tion, as represented in this case by Maimonides, restrained him from such a ruling. On the other hand, he could not in good conscience demand of this community that they pray for rain when such rain, according to their testi- mony, would be harmful to them. His only recourse, or so it must have seemed to him, was to suggest, in effect, that the Jews of Recife ignore the prayer for rain. If they had a particular need for rain during their winter, these Jews, like those of Nineveh, could always pray for it in Shome'a Tefilah. Shabbetai's opinion was later reiterated by Abraham Oppenheim (d. 1786).76 This ruling did not settle the matter for South American Jewry. In the early twentieth century, the Argentinian Jewish community posed the same question that had occupied the Jews of Recife three hundred years earlier.77 A number of inquiries were addressed by various groups in that country to different authorities, and they received a variety of responses, some endors- ing Shabbetai's view,78 others maintaining that the standard diaspora prac- tice must be followed regardless of meteorological conditions.79 The same 76. Eshel Avraham on Shulbhan Arukh, Orah IHayyim 117 (in standard edition), quoting Hayyim Shabbetai. 77. This question from Buenos Aires is somewhat surprising, since, even though summer and winter are opposite those seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, there is rain all year round. The heaviest rainfall is from October to April (Tishrei to Nisan), and the lightest rainfall is from June to August; cf. Schwerdtfeger, Climates of Central and South America, p. 91, and Climates of the World, p. 12. 78. See Judah Tarrab's responsum in Ezra ha-Kohen Tarrab, Sefer Milei de-'Ezra, ed. Judah Hayyim ha-Kohen Tarrab (Jerusalem, 1923/24), pp. 12a-18b. Tarrab's opinion, in agreement with Hayyim Shabbetai, was reached independently by Saul David Sathun (Sithon), Sefer She'elot u-Teshuvot Diber Sha'ul (Jerusalem, 1927/28), pp. la-b. Tarrab was also followed by his father, Ezra Tarrab, rabbi in Damascus (see Sathun, p. lb) and Jacob Joseph Tarrab, rabbi in Beirut (Sathun, p. lb and Tarrab, p. 18b). Sathun's view was endorsed by his colleague Aaron Goldman, rabbi of Moisesville (Qiryat Moshe), Argentina, and by three Jeru- salem rabbis, Joseph Yedid ha-Levi, Abraham Antebi Adam, and Solomon Laniado; see Diber Sha'ul, p. lb. (On Sathun and the Sefardic community of Buenos Aires, see Robert Weisbrot, The Jews of Argentina [Philadelphia, 1979], pp. 155-172, esp. pp. 162-163.) Elijah Yiluz, rabbi of Tiberius, agreed with Tarrab only insofar as rain was absolutely unnecessary for Argentinian Jews from Tishrei to Nisan (their summer). If it were at all desirable, Yiluz argued, they should follow the practice of the rest of the diaspora; see Milei de-'Ezra, pp. 19a-b. 79.

On the basis of Hayyim Shabbetai's ruling-as confirmed by Oppenheim-Solomon Hirschel (1762-1842), chief rabbi of the British Empire, instructed the Jews of Australia never to "mention" rain at all and not to "request" it in Birkat ha-Shanim.8" His successor, Chief Rabbi Nathan Adler (1803-1890), gave the same ruling in response to an inquiry from the Jews of Hobart, Australia, in 1846.82 In 1850/51, Yehoseph Schwarz in England was asked by a father what should be done by his son who had settled in the newly established Jewish community of Port Adelaide. Schwarz gave the same opinion as Hirschel and Adler.83 Thus, the custom was instituted for Australian Jews neither to mention rain nor to ask for it in Birkat ha-Shanim. Israel. The latter went on to say that the setting of the sixtieth day from the equinox as the time for prayer for rain in the diaspora was done without regard for the meteorological factors of countries other than Babylonia. Kook added that if one definitely needed rain between Nisan and Tishrei, he may pray for it in Shome'a Tefilah, but he need not necessarily do so; see Divrei Yebezqiyahu, pp. 19-20 (reprinted in Kook's Orah Mishpal [Jerusalem, 1979], pp. 30-31). Kook's reasoning on the subject can be seen also in his Mishpal Kohen (Jerusalem, 1966), p. 336. He wrote that Babylonia has a date separate from that of the Land of Israel only because most Jews lived there in talmudic times. If the majority of Jews were to live in some other country with a different climate, perhaps Rosh's opinion would be followed in regard to their saying of lal u-malar. According to this view, the Jews in the Southern Hemisphere, since they do not constitute a majority of all Jews, were not to look upon themselves as a whole com- munity but only as a collection of individuals. 80. See Ben-Zion Meir .Hai Ouziel (Sefardic chief rabbi of the Land of Israel), Sefer Mishpelei 'Uziel, Orab Hayyim, 2d ed.

LASKER This was the situation which prevailed when Abraham Eber Hirschowitz (1839/40-1924) arrived in Melbourne to take up a rabbinical position there. He decided that Australian Jews should follow the general diaspora custom concerning the mentioning and praying for rain.84 He, therefore, carried on a long campaign to alter the practice which had become established over the course of fifty years. His campaign, too long and involved to describe here in detail, led him to conduct a worldwide correspondence with leading Jewish authorities. He argued that in Melbourne rain was both necessary and bene- ficial throughout the year, a fact in regard to which, he claimed, Chief Rabbis Hirschel and Nathan Adler had been misinformed when they gave their ruling.85 Hirschowitz went so far as to set up his own minyan that would pray for rain at the time which he felt was appropriate. In addition, he attempted to forbid his congregants from praying with or answering amen to those who disagreed with him.86 The authorities to whom Hirschowitz wrote gave varied answers. Isaac Elhanan Spektor (1817-1896, in Kovno) and Jacob Reinowitz (1818-1893, in London) agreed with Hirschowitz that Australian Jews should pray for rain according to the general diaspora practice.87 Samuel Salant (1816-1909, in Jerusalem) at first agreed with Hirschowitz but later back- tracked and argued that the custom supported by Nathan Adler should be continued. He further suggested that the final determination of the question depended on an exact knowledge of Australian meteorological conditions.

On Davis, cf. L. M. Goldman, The Jews in Victoria in the Nineteenth Century (Melbourne, 1954), index, p. 432. Climatic surveys bear out Hirschowitz and Davis's contention that rain does fall in the Australian summer (Tishrei to Nisan), and, in fact, certain localities in Australia (mostly in the northeast) receive most of their rainfall during this period. Cf. J. Gentili, ed., Climates of Australia and New Zealand, World Survey of Climatology, no. 13 (Amsterdam, 1971), pp. 133-163. For charts of Melbourne and Sydney, see pp. 273, 274, 354-355, 364-365.

Reinowitz refused, however, to go along with Hirschowitz's edict that his congregants were not to pray with, or answer Amen to, those Jews who disagreed with him (Hirschowitz). Even though Reinowitz agreed with Hirschowitz's opinion on tal u-malar, he objected to such a drastic step. After all, Reinowitz wrote, one is allowed to,pray with and answer Amen to much worse sinners. Spektor's responsum is quoted in Hezekiah Shabbetai, Divrei Yebezqiyahu, p. 22, and Mayer Amsel, Sefer She'elot u-Teshuvot ha-Ma'or (New York, 1966), p. 474.</page><page sequence="27">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 167 ruled that Australian Jews should continue to follow the prescription of Solomon Hirschel and of his own father, Nathan Adler.88 Aryeh Leib Roshkes (late nineteenth century, in Vilna) gave an equivocal answer. After an extended discussion of the sources (principally Maimonides, Rosh, and Hayyim Shabbetai), he ruled that the law is totally dependent upon the meteorological conditions. If rain is, indeed, harmful during the Australian summer, then, of course, Jews should not pray for it then. He suggested that they might mention dew instead of rain (mashiv ha-ruabh u-morid ha-tal). On the other hand, if rain has value, then they should adopt the custom of the rest of the diaspora. Roshkes suggested, though, that Hirschowitz not exert himself to such an extent to change the local custom.89 Hirschowitz left Melbourne soon thereafter, having been unsuccessful in his campaign to alter the Australian practice.90 In his struggle, Hirschowitz found himself, in a sense, very much in the position of Rosh, though, of course, their objectives were diametrically opposed. Rosh wished to abolish the local custom, based on what was to him a misreading of tradition, in favor of a new custom based on logic and the correct meteorological facts. Hirschowitz also wished to abolish the local custom, based on what was to him a misreading of logic and of the meteorological facts, in favor of an old-new custom based on tradition and the correct meteorological facts. Both found themselves at odds with the rest of the community. Rosh decided that acquiescence was the better part of valor; Hirschowitz went to America. 88. Hirschowitz, Beit Avraham, pp. 35-39. 89. Ibid., pp. 41-47. Roshkes argued that the real determinant is whether rain in their summer (Tishrei-Nisan) is harmful for the Jews in Australia, as it apparently is for the Jews in Brazil. 90. Hirschowitz was apparently a colorful and controversial individual. His first public appearance in Melbourne nearly caused a riot; see Goldman, Jews in Victoria, p. 368. He set up a "Beth Hamedrash" in Melbourne; cf. ibid., and Jewish Chronicle, n.s., no. 1197, (March 11, 1892), p. 18. The exact chronological order of the events in the tal u-malar debate (and the final outcome) is not clearly presented by Hirschowitz. Some of the correspondence is not presented, and references are made to the opinions of other authorities without citations of the sources. Hirschowitz spent only three years in Melbourne before leaving for America, where he served in Toledo, Ohio, and Borough Park, New York. He eventually settled in the Land of Israel. According to Goldman, Jews in Victoria, p. 369, Hirschowitz was forced to leave Melbourne because of a disagreement about his policy of accepting proselytes. One can speculate whether the controversy he engendered about tal u-malar may not also have been a factor in the brevity of his tenure in Melbourne. His correspondence on the issue took place in 1892-93; he left for America in August 1894; cf. Beit Avraham, p. 1, in which Hirschowitz described his journey</page><page sequence="28">168 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER Hirschowitz's efforts, however, were not in vain. In what might be consi- dered a posthumous victory, the immediate past chief rabbi of Australia, Israel Porush (now emeritus), adopted the Babylonian practice (starting lal u-malar on the sixtieth day from the equinox) so as "to follow the seasons in Eretz Yisrael."9' His predecessor at the Great Synagogue, Sydney, had replaced the Geshem and Tal hymns recited before Musaf on Shemini Atzeret and on Passover with a special prayer in English, composed by himself. The same prayer was read on both occasions and dealt in general terms with the change of seasons. Mashiv ha-ruab was not said. Porush reintroduced the omitted prayers, "and this is the custom until today.""92 His motivation for this change was "in accordance with the importance Eretz Yisrael occupies today in our life."'93 from Melbourne to San Francisco and considered the halakhic problems occasioned by cross- ing the international date line. 91. From a private communication to the authors from Chief Rabbi Emeritus Porush, Sept. 12, 1979. 92. Ibid. 93. Ibid. The question of jal u-matar rose also among the Jews of New Zealand. Zevi Pesab Frank, Ashkenazic chief rabbi of Jerusalem, ruled that Jews there should follow the normal diaspora practice; see Har Zevi (n. 51), pp. 55-56. Cf., also, his responsum dealing with Tu Bi-Shevat in the Southern Hemisphere in Har Zevi, Orahb Iayyim 2 (Jerusalem, 1972/73), pp. 48-49. See also Abraham Rapaport, Quntras (n. 57), p. 17, who ruled that the entire Southern Hemisphere should follow the Babylonian practice unless rain is definitely harmful. There are two novel responsa on this question. Jacob Meir, Sefardic chief rabbi of the Land of Israel, in Shabbetai's Divrei Yehezqiyahu, pp. 20-22, suggested that Jews in the Southern Hemisphere should "mention" and "request" dew all year round. If they need rain during their winter, they can pray for it in Shome'a Tefilah, but only in a whisper (see Appendix). Thus, while Jews in the rest of the world were praying for rain, Jews in the Southern Hemisphere would at least be praying for dew. Meir added that this decision should be considered theoreti- cally correct (le-halakhah), but not for practical usage (le-ma'aseh) because of the differing opinion of Rabbis Alfandari and Kook. Samuel Halevi Wosner, Shevel ha-Levi (Bnai Brak, 1969/70), pp. 22-23, suggested to the Jews of Montevideo, Uruguay, that they completely reverse the procedure of the Northern Hemisphere. Hence, they should mention and request rain in their winter (Nisan to Tishrei) and do neither in their summer (Tishrei to Nisan). He cautioned that this opinon should not be implemented unless a well-known authority (ga'on mefursam) agreed with him. Interestingly, neither Wosner nor any other authority, to our knowledge, suggested starting lal u-matar in the Southern Hemisphere on the sixtieth day from the vernal equinox. Solomon Braun, She'arim Mepuyyanim ba-Halakhah on Qi;;ur Shullhan Arukh, vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 1969/70), pp. 107-108, raised one more halakhic question concerning the practice in the Southern Hemisphere. After reviewing the relevant material (Ijayyim Shabbetai and Hirschowitz), he asked what practice should be followed by a resident of the Northern Hemisphere who travels to the Southern Hemisphere, yet intends to return to his original location. Braun ruled that such a person should pray for rain according to the practice in his country of origin.</page><page sequence="29">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 169 The Australian experience encapsulates well all the factors that played a part in previous discussions of when tal u-malar should be said in the diaspora. There was logic, there was local custom, there was the appeal to tradition and to outside authorities. There was even intracommunal strife. In the end, the desire to identify with the Land of Israel was dominant. Herein, perhaps, lies the final irony: in order to follow the seasons in the Land of Israel, the Jews of Australia now pray for rain when it is needed at the site of ancient Babylonia. The history of the problem of when to begin saying tal u-matar in the Southern Hemisphere raises a number of issues for reflection. When one looks at the meteorological data, it is hard to see what the debate in the Southern Hemisphere is all about.94 It appears that none of the countries discussed here has a radical distinction between rainy and dry seasons; hence, there should be no more problems in the applying of the Babylonian pattern than in Europe, which also, for the most part, has no such distinc- tion. The fact that winter and summer are reversed should not have an influence on the prayer for rain if there are no distinct rainy and dry seasons. Even in Recife, where there are such distinct seasons, there still is rain in the "dry season," and the seasons do not follow the equinoctial summer and winter. It seems, then, that if the first Jewish settlers in the Southern Hemisphere had had correct meteorological information, they might never have asked the question we have been discussing. What is likely is that the reversal of winter and summer was such a shock for the early settlers that they assumed, in the absence of precise meteorological charts, that the season which was predominantly rainy and the season which was predo- minantly dry were also completely different from those with which they were familiar. This may have been one reason why the Jews df Recife said that rain in their summer was not only undesirable but also harmful. We may also ask why, if the bonds of tradition are so strong, Jews who had been starting the prayer for rain sixty days after the autumnal equinox The authors have been unable to ascertain the exact procedure concerning tal u-matar currently in effect in each South American country. Conversations with former Argentinian Jews now resident in Israel have revealed that the Sefardic Jewish communities there follow the opinion of Tarrab and Sathun, and, therefore, they never mention or request rain the whole year round. Only when they came to Israel did these Sefardic Jews learn to say Barekh 'Aleinu (the winter form of the Birkat ha-Shanim); previously, they had said Barekheinu the year round (cf. n. 1). Ashkenazic communities in Argentina, however, follow the Babylonian pattern. 94. See nn. 73, 77, 80, 85.</page><page sequence="30">170 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER in their native countries would suddenly question this procedure in their new homes. The answer may very well lie in the nature of the first Jewish settlers in South America and Australia. If they had been strongly wedded to the customs of their fathers, it is unlikely that they would have set out for climes unknown where the opportunities to practice Judaism fully were nonexistent. They were sufficiently knowledgeable so as to regard the time for saying lal u-malar as a problem. They were not, however, so traditional as to follow the general diaspora practice without question. They were, in effect, pioneers in terms of both geography and halakhah.95 Only when the Jewish communities were somewhat well established did Jews who were more traditional arrive. It is these Jews, as exemplified by Abraham Hirschowitz, who tried to set aside the innovation of the first settlers. By then, innovation had become entrenched custom and, hence, difficult to uproot. Still, as the case of Australia demonstrates, change can be effected. It is probable that Porush's success, after Hirschowitz's failure, became possible when increased Jewish immigration to Australia brought a greater number of traditional Jews to that country. Conclusion We have attempted here to use the history of one particular halakhic question, namely, when the prayer for rain should be recited in the diaspora, as an example of the way in which Jewish law develops. The various ways in which this question has been treated demonstrate very well the several factors that have an impact on the halakhic process. Some authorities tried to determine the halakhah by means of logical inference: just as Jews in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia pray for rain when it is good for them, so all other Jewish communities should pray for rain according to their own local needs. Other rabbis, however, decided that competing factors should be decisive. These included tradition, as represented by authoritative texts, custom based on that tradition, and the need for Jewish unity. Even the 95. The first Jews in Brazil were Marranos who had returned to Judaism; they were joined by sundry adventurers. The first Jews in Australia were convicts, even though those who asked about jal u-matar probably arrived in Australia under more auspicious circumstances. The fact that these Jews were sufficiently versed in, and concerned about, Jewish law to ask about the prayer for rain demonstrates their learning, although in their own day they were probably considered ignoramuses.</page><page sequence="31">PRAYER FOR RAIN IN THE POST-TALMUDIC DIASPORA 171 "correct" interpretation of the Talmud could become secondary when con- fronted with other considerations. Logic, in fact, could be ignored almost altogether. This is most clear when we look at the case of the Southern Hemisphere. Those who argue that the general diaspora practice must be maintained even when the meteorological situation has changed, are, in effect, saying that for the sake of Jewish unity, it is better for a Jew in South America to pray for rain when it is needed in Babylonia than to pray for it when it is needed where he himself lives.96 This, of course, is the logical result of the action of Rosh's contemporaries, who, for the sake of custom, refused to accept "the words of the living God."97 Appendix When the inhabitants of Nineveh asked Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi in which blessing they should pray for rain in the summer, he replied: in Shome'a 96. This may be one of the sources of the widely held fallacy that in the diaspora tal u-malar is said for rain in Israel (see above, n. 20). In a sense, though, one could say that diaspora Jews are really praying for rain in what was ancient Babylonia. This, indeed, is the opinion of Shlomo Min-HaHar, "Countries That Require Rain from the Seventh of Heshvan and the Summer Months" (Hebrew), Techumin, I (Winter 1979/80): 137-148. Min-HaHar argued that in essence all the diaspora prays for the welfare of Babylonia as the seat of Jewish scholarship, and that the separate Babylonian custom came about only after the close of the Mishnah (a doubtful statement; see the authors' "Jewish Prayer for Rain in Babylonia"). Just as all Israel accepted the Babylonian Talmud instead of the Jerusalem Talmud, it took upon itself to pray for the Babylonian sages rather than the sages of the Land of Israel. Min-HaHar expressed the hope (p. 148) that soon all diaspora countries will pray for rain from the seventh of Marhleshvan as the centrality of the "Torah of the Land of Israel" is recognized. 97. See above, n. 50. There is one more element in the trivialization of the Jewish prayer for rain which has not been discussed here. In order to determine the sixtieth day from the equinox for the purposes of tal u-matar, the rules laid down by Samuel (Erubin 56a) are employed. They are based on a calculation of the year as being exactly 365 1/4 days long, rather than the more exact 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds. As a result of this slight inaccuracy, the calculated equinox has slowly moved forward through the centuries, so that now the autumnal equinox is computed to fall on October 7. The prayer for rain begins, therefore, in Ma'ariv of December 4 (except in the year before a civil leap year, when it begins in Ma'ariv of December 5, since the tequfah falls on October 7 at 9:00 P.M. [after dark]). Since the dates December 4 and 5 have no meaning at all to the average worshipper, the significance of the prayer for rain has been diminished even further. The use of an inaccurate calculation for determining the equinox, despite the knowledge that the astronomical equinox falls on a much different day, is another example of the supremacy of custom over logic. This issue must be dealt with elsewhere. (Another example of the strong effect of custom in ritual even at the expense of logic is the present-day retention in the prayer Yequm Purqan of the prayers for the Babylonian exilarch and the heads of the Kallah months, positions which have not existed for many centuries.)</page><page sequence="32">172 ARNOLD A. LASKER AND DANIEL J. LASKER Tefilah. As we have seen, this became, more or less, the halakhah for Jews in the diaspora who need rain between Passover and the sixtieth day from the equinox. Most authorities have ruled that such Jews should pray for rain in Shome'a Tefilah (and not in Birkat ha-Shanim). This practice is ultimately based on the statement in Avodah Zarah 8a that one requests his personal needs in Shome'a Tefilah, except for health, for which one prays in the eighth benediction (Rofe' Ulolei 'Amo Yisrael, and livelihood, which is requested in Birkat ha-Shanim. Rain, as a blessing needed for livelihood, is requested in Birkat ha-Shanim. This applies, however, only in the rainy season, for at other times rain is considered harmful for "most of the world" (i.e., the Land of Israel and Babylonia). Therefore, one who prays for it at that time does not do so in Birkat ha-Shanim. Rather, he uses Shome'a Tefilah, the catch-all blessing, what Meiri called 'afarkheset (lit., "a hopper").98 Though this is the halakhah, the custom has developed not to pray for rain using the words tal u-matar in Shome'a Tefilah. As early as the begin- ning of the fourteenth century, Ritba stated that when rain is needed between Shemini Atzeret and the sixtieth day from the equinox, even though one may pray for it in Shome'a Tefilah, the practice is not to do so.99 This custom was strongly reinforced by Joel Sirkes (Bab), who recorded that once two righteous men prayed for rain in Shome'a Tefilah, and they both died untimely deaths that very same year. Sirkes attributed their demise to the fact that their prayer was considered an unnecessary imposition upon God.'00 Sirkes's son-in-law, David ben Samuel ha-Levi (Taz, 1586-1667), objected to the possibility that God would consider prayers for rain an imposition, even when they are offered outside the normal season. Rather, he argued, it is permissible only for individuals, but not the sheliabh ibbur, to insert tal u-malar into Shome'a Tefilah. He based this conclusion on Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi's answer to the Jews of Nineveh. Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi had 98. Meiri is also the one to say that rain in the summer is harmful for most of the world; see Beit ha-Behirah, p. 54.

Taz inferred from this statement that only individuals should ask for rain in this matter, and that saying tal u-matar publicly in Shome'a Tefilab is not allowed.'0' David Fraenkel (1707-1762) arrived at the same conclusion, using the Jerusalem Talmud's version of the Nineveh incident. R. Yose had suggested saying tal u-matar in the six additional blessings added in the communal prayers on a fast-day. Since, however, individuals do not say these bless- ings, R. Hanina said that a person praying alone asks for rain in Shome'a Tefilah. Therefore, Fraenkel argued, only individuals may say tal u-matar in Shome'a Tefilah; communities do not have this option inasmuch as they have another alternative (in the six blessings) prescribed for them.'02 This reluctance to pray for rain in Shome'a Tefilah is evident also in the responsa on the question of the Southern Hemisphere. The rabbis who suggested that Jews in this part of the world pray for rain in Shome'a Tefilah during their winter did not give unqualified support to the practice.'03 It is clear, then, that even though Jews may pray for rain in Shome'a Tefilah, they are discouraged from doing so. Thus, Jews in places that need rain between Shemini Atzeret and the sixtieth day from the equinox, or between Passover and Shavuot, are restrained from requesting such rain. Furthermore, Jews in the Southern Hemisphere can, in effect, pray for rain either in their summer, when it is not really needed, or not at all. In the body of this paper, we have shown how custom and the desire for uniformity have contributed to a diminution in the meaningfulness of the Jewish prayer for rain. In the case of saying tal u-matar in Shome'a Tefilah, once again custom has dictated that even this possibility of a sincere prayer 101. Turei Zahav on Shulbhan Arukh, Orahb ayyim 117. 102.
