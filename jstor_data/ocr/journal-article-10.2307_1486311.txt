<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE TROUSSEAUX OF JEWISH BRIDES FROM THE FATIMID PERIOD by SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, New Jersey Dedicated to Richard Ettinghausen in friendship and admiration Trousseau lists in the hundreds, complete or fragmentary, have survived in the Cairo Geniza. Normally they are included in marriage contracts, rare- ly in engagement settlements, and many have been preserved separately, bearing only the names of the bride and the groom with or without date, and often lacking even these pieces of information. This happened when the ex- tant sheet had originally formed part of a larger document, or when the trousseau was listed in a record book of the community. Such a list detailed (a) the jewelry and other objects made of precious metals, (b) the clothing of the bride and all that went with it, especially the beautiful chests in which they were kept, (c) the bedding and hangings, (d) the copper and other kitchenware and household goods, as well as (e) the real estate possessed by her, either as part of her dowry, or as her personal property (in which case it was not under the jurisdiction of her future hus- band). Occasionally, (f) one or several maidservants accompanied the bride to her new home, and are listed with their names and, under certain circum- stances, their function (kitchen maid or personal attendant). In exceptional cases, (g) books formed a valuable part of the outfit. The impact of the dowry on family life and on the economy and society 77</page><page sequence="2">78 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN in general was immense. The reader is referred to the third volume of my book, A Mediterranean Society, subtitled The Family, at present in print, and to Mordechai A. Friedman's forthcoming comprehensive study on the marriage contract according to Palestinian custom.' The purpose of this paper is to give the reader an inkling of the material civilization surrounding the Jews in the lands of Islam at a time when the Jerusalem yeshiva, the High Council of the community, still was fully functioning, or when Judah ha-Levi, on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, visited Egypt. Material on this subject has been collected by me for many years, but what I have to offer is by no means definitive. Dr. Yedida Kalfon Stillman's dissertation, "Female Attire in Medieval Egypt according to the Trousseau Lists and Cognate Material from the Cairo Geniza,"2 is an auspicious beginning, but much ad- ditional work has to be done before all the available information is brought under control and satisfactorily interpreted. Some details may defy explana- tion altogether. In order to be able to use these trousseau lists as a source for material civilization, one must understand their legal nature. The nedunya, or dowry, of a Jewish wife, was entrusted to her husband, but its full value had to be restored to her in the case of a divorce or the husband's death. Unlike later in Europe, where the dowry consisted largely of money and, thus, was en- tirely at the disposal of the husband, in "classical" Geniza times, that is, from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries, it consisted exclusively of jewelry, clothing, and other items under the personal control of the wife. A husband could, and often did, give a piece of his wife's jewelry or real estate as collateral for a loan, but for this he needed her cooperation. Only in the fifteenth century, when Jews from Christian countries began to settle in Egypt, do we find that the dowry had to be provided partly or mainly in cash. Since the nedunya, by definition, should contain only durable items,3 ceramics, so prominent in Islamic civilization, are completely absent from 1.

Copper and brass bowls, cups, and dishes, appear in them regularly, but no china. But china, real china, has been found by the excavators of Fustat, the ancient Islamic capital of Egypt, where the Geniza people lived, and when a representative of Jewish merchants in Aden, South Arabia, sends to the Gaon of the Palestinian yeshiva (which then, in 1134, had its seat in Cairo) a set of opaque Chinese bowls-familiar to us from visits to any larger museum-we may safely assume that fine ceramics were not absent from a Jewish table. A Geniza letter tells about a newly wed girl in a provincial town who was in great trouble with her husband because she had to serve him his food in earthenware since the "copper" forming part of her bridal outfit had not yet arrived from the capital. But these were poor people, as may be concluded from other details in that letter. Other items absent from the trousseau lists might have been customarily provided by the husband. Nowhere is there mention of footwear. In an early stage of my study of the Geniza, I attributed this to the Islamic taboo against speaking of shoes in polite conversation. They were the "unmen- tionables," as underwear and trousers were in Anglo-Saxon society not long ago. Newcomers to Jerusalem from Yemen speaking to me would never refer to shoes without adding .haC mikkew6dokh,"it is beneath your dignity." However, a more intimate study of the Geniza letters showed that their writers were not fussy at all in this matter. Shoes are often mentioned, their make and colors (for instance, red or yellow) are described, and, it seems, one tried to match these with one's clothing. The absence of footwear from the trousseau might have had another reason. Professor Sylvia Haim Kedourie mentioned to me that in past generations it was customary among the Jews of Baghdad that the fiance sent to his bride (and some of her female relatives) gifts of shoes. As is well known from the Bible (Deuteronomy 25:9, Ruth 4:7) and other sources, the giving or taking of shoes was a symbol of the transfer of authority. An Arabic papyrus containing the details of the "wedding equipment" sent by a groom to his bride lists at its end a pair of shoes.4 Most likely, a similar custom prevailed in the society which left us their records in the Geniza. I have made mention of the absence from the dowry of cash, ceramics, and footwear in order to impress upon the reader that the interpretation of the trousseau lists, as self-explanatory as they appear, needs a certain measure of circumspection. One more remark: textiles (for clothing and bedding) were far more durable in those days than they are customarily in our own times. As is proved by wills, they were often left as heirlooms (by 4. Adolf Grohmann, From the World of Arabic Papyri (Cairo, 1952), p. 156: a list of wed- ding articles, such as perfumes, henna, rose-water and wax candles. Eleventh century.</page><page sequence="4">80 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN both men and women). Moreover, the husband was obliged to provide his wife with clothing. Thus the textiles brought in by the bride, like her jewelry and other goods made of metal, were destined not only for use, but served as an investment assuring in part her economic security and independence. In the following, three trousseaux are presented, the first of a lower middle-class bride, the second of a well-to-do one, and the third-of the richest girl found thus far in the Geniza. The first list is included in a mar- riage contract, the second in an engagement agreement, and the third is a list without name and date. Documents II and III are contemporary, as is proved by the handwriting, which is that of none other than Nathan b. Samuel he-HIiver, secretary of the Nagid Samuel b. Hananyah, and cor- respondent and esteemed friend of the poet Judah ha-Levi. Documents signed by Nathan during the years 1128-1153 have been preserved, but he lived for another ten years.5 Document I differs from the two other documents in various respects. It is Karaite. The Karaite ketubba widely differs from the Rabbanite. It was created during the "bourgeois revolution" of the early centuries of Islam and was, therefore, far more refined, expressive, and outspoken about the relations between husband and wife than the rigid Rabbanite ketubba, a remnant from antiquity. It was written in Hebrew, a language which could easily be handled, while Aramaic, obligatory in the Rabbanite ketubba, soon became a dead language. Finally, it spelled out the specific injunctions which a Karaite couple had to observe. I translate the document in full, because I believe that it reflects the attitude toward marriage in Geniza times in general and not solely with respect to the Karaite denomination. For legal and other details the reader is referred to the books mentioned in notes 1 and 7. The two documents from the second quarter of the twelfth century were written in Fustat, the ancient Islamic capital.of Egypt; the Karaite ketubba originated in Jerusalem in 1028. Attention must be paid to the date. Those were the cruel years when the population of Palestine, and not only the Jews, were exposed to pillage, murder, and rape, "the like of which never had happened in Islam." The Fatimid government was unable to protect the country from the Bedouin hordes which overran it.6 But nothing in our document betrays the terrible times through which Jerusalem had gone. As often happens in cataclysmic events, not everyone was affected. 5. See Mediterranean Society, 2:513, n. 18, and vol. 3, sec. D, n. 96. 6.

Of these, I have already given her five gold pieces. The fifty silver pieces I am giving her today at the wedding ceremony, and thirty-five good gold pieces remain as a fully certified and established debt incumbent on me and on my possessions during my life time and after my death.'6 The above-mentioned Sarwa listened to the words of Hezekiah and agreed to marry him and to be his wife and companion" in purity, holiness, and fear of God, to listen to his words, to honor and to hold him dear, to be his helper,'" and to do in his house what a virtuous Jewish woman is ex- pected to do, to conduct herself toward him with love and considerateness, to be under his rule, and her desire will be toward him.'9 Sarwa, out of her free will, appointed as her representative Joseph b. Abraham ha-Kohen20 to take care of the affairs of her marriage. Two trustworthy persons, Mevorakh b. David and Jacob b. Fallan, were the witnesses of this appointment.21 This Joseph, the representative, appeared before the elders and testified that he had received from Hezekiah the preliminary payment of five gold pieces and that he agreed to marry off the above-mentioned Sarwa to Hezekiah with this nuptial gift on the conditions specified above in this document. These are the valuables brought in by Sarwa to the house of her husband Hezekiah: 14. The same obligations are repeated in other words. 15. This was obligatory among Karaites; with the Rabbanites twenty-five silver pieces were the gift due to a virgin. 16. In practice, the "additional" bridal gift was the main one. 17. As in Malachi 2:14. 18. Genesis 2:18. 19. Genesis 3:16. From the husband love and affection, bibba, is expected; from the wife, love and considerateness, .zsa, a standard term in Karaite ketubbot. 20. Not of her kin, since her father was not a Kohen.

The dastaynaq (a Persian word) was a precious, broad wristband, normally inlaid with pearls. Our women normally wear one bracelet of the same type; in Geniza times-as in those of the biblical patriarchs, see Genesis 24:22-invariably bracelets were worn in pairs, one of the same type on each arm. When only one was available (e.g., as reported in the Geniza, when a mother gave one to each of her two daughters) the list notes expressly: one single bracelet. 23. I complemented the two missing superscriptions from TS 16.80 (fragmentary), also Karaite and fairly contemporary with our ketubba; the bride was well-to-do. 24. The mi'jar, or wimple, that is a turban-like cloth wound around the head and then flow- ing down over the body, was a main, and, as here, often the most costly part of the female dress. The term ridawdni, "like a ridd, or mantle," describes the wimple as particularly long and broad. 25. The 'aq(a)biyya is very common in the Geniza, but has not yet been found by me elsewhere. Dominique Chevalier, "Les tissus ikat6s d'Alep et de Damas," Syria 39 (1962): 310, gives al-'aqqdbfyatayn "the two green almonds," as the color of an ikate textile. But, as is evi- dent also from the example here, 'aq(a)biyya designates the form of a dress, not its color. I derive the word from 'aqb, heel, and explain it as a robe reaching down to the ground, unlike the usual dress, which exposed the lower end of the pants to the eye (as may be seen on all thirteenth century miniatures depicting women. We have no earlier ones.). The long dress, with the train on the ground, shows the woman as noble, that is, doing no manual work-a common theme in Arabic poetry. 26. The muld'a was (and still is) worn as a cloak covering the woman's body while going out. At night, it served also as a blanket. 27.

The two agreed between themselves that should Sarwa, God beware, leave this world without a child from him, all that she brought in with her would go back to her heirs from her kin.41 Contrariwise, her heirs would have no claim on the final instalment of the nuptial gift incumbent on Hezekiah. They also agreed to keep the holidays by the observation of the new moon and of the ripening of the ears in Eretz Israel; that they would not eat beef and mutton in Jerusalem until the altar of God is erected; and that they would not apply to a gentile court in exchange for the laws of the Torah.42 the Caspian sea. It was imitated in many places, especially in Ramle (probably the Egyptian, not the Palestinian town of that name). 37. A place in Iran, near Herat: Buziydn, pronounced Buziy6n. 38. The actual grand total seems to be 701/2, not 611/2 dinars, but long experience has taught me that it is I, not the Geniza clerks, who make mistakes in additions. Here, something special might have happened. As often at weddings of people with little money, there was probably a squabble over the estimate, and finally an agreement about the total owed by the husband was reached. 39. The dowry remains the property of the wife; the husband may use it with her consent. 40. Rabbinical law was not as outspoken and liberal in this matter as the Karaite dispensa- tion. 41. Literally, "her families," that is from her father's side. Most of the Rabbanite Geniza marriage contracts have adopted the Palestinian custom that one half of the dowry reverts to the wife's paternal family in case she has no child from the man she married. But this is not general rabbinical law. 42. In theory, at least, the Karaites, like the Muslims, have no fixed calendar. As in ancient Israel, the new month was "declared," when the new moon was actually sighted, and a second Adar was "intercalated," when the grain in Israel had not greened in time. The Geniza has preserved actual reports by Karaites about the greening of the ears, as well as a letter about a particularly pious Karaite who refrained in Jerusalem not only from beef and mutton, but also</page><page sequence="10">86 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN We made the symbolic purchase from Hezekiah, son of Benjamin, with regard to all that is written and stated above.

Note that the document is signed by ten witnesses, of whom four were Kohens, two Levis, and only four, ordinary Jews. The bride's representative also was a Kohen. II This document, too, is translated in full because it shows the reader the arrangements and conditions common at a Rabbanite marriage in Geniza times. To be sure, every case was different, but the basic stipulations specified below were fairly common. The ketubba was not a formulary, but a real contract, reflecting the social and economic positions of the con- tracting parties. The bride, Sitt al-KhaSSa ("Mistress over the Upper Class"), was the from chicken. (The Karaite calendar to this day differs from the Rabbanite. The Yom Kippur War was for them an Erev Yom Kippur war, for in 1973 their Day of Atonement fell one day later.) Any dispute arising in married life must be settled in a Jewish court. 43.

Both possessed houses in Fustat. Of her grandfather's house Sitt al-KhdiSa had inherited five out of twenty-four shares, of her father's house, one half of the property. Her mother Sitt al-Sida ("Mistress over the Lords"), the daughter of a physi- cian, acted on her behalf, for the girl, despite her pompous epithet, no doubt was a teenager who knew little about men and money. In general, only women previously married dealt directly with their future husbands. Docu- ment III is a sheet containing solely the details about a rich dowry, matched by an exceptionally high nuptial gift. It was written in Fustat, approximately between 1128 and 1153 (see above, note 5). The girl, like that of Document II, certainly was orphaned by her father. She received books worth 250 dinars, and who would be prepared to part with his library during his lifetime? The father probably was a physician; a scholar would hardly have been able to leave 1,600 dinars to his daughter. But there were, of course, scholarly physicians. The notes accompanying the translation of Documents I and III should not be taken as full commentaries on the terms occurring in them. They in- tend to enable the reader to form an idea of how a woman and the interior of her house looked in those far away times and places.

The remark in Document II, fol. 47v, 1. 12, "a dinar is worth a dinar, real value, not doubled," assures us that here we have to do with the actual cost of the outfit. The writer, judge Nathan b. Samuel he-Hiavar and, even more so, his son Mev6rikh (from whose hand we have over a hundred documents) adhered to the rule of providing the real es- timates (unless expressly stated otherwise), and as the prices in Document III, also written by Nathan, prove, the latter was no exception. Here, the remark "a dinar is a dinar," certainly was included in the marriage contract, which we do not possess. The prices in Document I, according to all we know, also were real. As is natural, the dowries of the poor and the rich differed most with regard to the precious metals. The jewelry of the well-to-do bride of Fustat was twenty times as valuable as that of the lower middle-class girl from Jerusalem, and that of the anonymous rich bride was worth three times more than that of her well-to-do contemporary. In all other respects the 85. Ar. mudhayyal.</page><page sequence="22">98 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN greatest variety prevailed, because a large part of the outfit consisted of heirlooms and depended on many other circumstances. For example, the Karaite girl from Jerusalem, who had so little, possessed a number of duplicates:86 two Sicilian robes, two white and two red robes, two buckets, two washbasins, etc. Probably, a sister of hers had died, and the items prepared for the dead girl went to the survivor. At the Dressing Table Earrings, bracelets (always in pairs, and of at least five different types), and finger rings (also of the greatest variety) were the minimum "gold" adorning a bride. Any more affluent girl possessed an 'isdba, or pearl- studded headband, or tiara, and often more than one. The value of this car- dinal piece of jewelry brought in by the two girls from Fustat (seventy and eighty dinars, respectively) could provide a living for about three years for a modest family. Necklaces, shoulder bands, and chokers of different materials (such as gold and amber) and forms (disks, beads, cylinders) without or with a middle piece, such as a golden apple or a little box (originally containing an amulet), followed close in value, and most brides in better circumstances possessed one or several pairs of ornate pins (the Roman fibulae) with which the usually very loose garments were kept in place. Anklets, however, so prominent in the Bible (Joshua 15:16, Isaiah 3:16-18) and in the Islamic world, were extremely rare and disappear from the Geniza around 1040; somehow, they did not fit into the Jewish urban society of those days; and nose rings, still in use in Cairo during the nineteenth century, are entirely absent from the Geniza. The toilet utensils, such as mirrors, scent and ointment boxes, and the kohl sticks and containers usually were also made of, or decorated with, precious materials. It is characteristic, however, that bric-a-bric was rare. The crystal cock (and perhaps also the lion, see note 78) of the rich bride, and the tamathil, or figurines, found in other ketubbas, are exceptional. In clothing, the headgear took pride of place. Since the head is the body's most important part, its cover received particular attention. Cor- responding to the man's turban, the woman had her wimple (see note 60) and many types of veils, kerchiefs, and mantillas. The skull cap, ma'raqa or mi'raqa (literally, "cover for perspiration") worn beneath the other, more 86. Not to be confused with "pairs," as the pairs of bracelets possessed by her.</page><page sequence="23">TROUSSEAUX FROM THE FATIMID PERIOD 99 sumptuous, coverings of the head, is always listed in ketubbas when made of fine Egyptian linen, red Sicilian silk, and the like.87 The robes, either with sleeves or covering the entire body including the arms, had no buttons. (These came into use far later, under the influence of Western Europe.) The precious pins, mentioned before, did the service of fastening the garments. Belts, too, although found, were not common. One tried to match the colors of robe, cloak, and wimple. In general, colors played a great role in a woman's choice of her wardrobe. Wherever we have a more detailed list, one can observe that the bride had preferences. Thus our rich bride seems to have liked discreet colors, such as greyish"8 (column II, 11. 3, 15-16), or colors defined by clouds (1. 2), poultice (1. 20), wax (1. 23), starch (1. 29), apricots (1. 20), or pistachios (column III, 1. 2). Women's underwear was subsumed under the item "a bureau89 and that which is in it," certainly a pre-Islamic scribal usage, since the phrase "and that which is in it" is mostly in Aramaic. Only slips, ghildla, of fine, sometimes translu- cent, linen are regularly listed, when they were high-priced. (Even the girl from Jerusalem of modest circumstances had two slips worthy enough to be noted.) But judge Nathan preferred to banish such pieces of clothing, which were worn directly on a woman's body, into the anomymity of the "bureau" or "pieces of clothing" (Document III, fol. 47v, 1. 5). As a rule, clothes were not hung up in wardrobes, but kept in chests or trunks beautified with ornaments in mother-of-pearl and ivory or wood carvings, or both. Since clothes kept in this way needed frequent airing, well-to-do women enjoyed the unending pleasure of trying on their things and preening with them before admiring members of the household or friends. A final piece of a bride's outfit was the equipment for the visit to the public bathhouse, namely the mazarra, a handbag made of precious textiles and called thus (derived from zirr, button) because it was fashioned by but- 87. The term mi'raqa (pronounced, perhaps, ma'raqa) extremely common in the Geniza, seems to be absent from the dictionaries of classical Arabic. Instead, up to the present day, 'ara- qiyya is used. Since men also wore skull caps, in inventories one would note "a female skull cap," e.g., TS NS J 184. The entry ma'raqa in Dozy, Suppldment, 2:121a, is based on a nineteenth century North African glossary. 88. Ar. mannf, from mann (the biblical mdn, manna), "honey dew," "fine dust," often found in the Geniza, but seemingly absent from Arabic dictionaries. 89. Ar. muqaddama, common in the Geniza but apparently not known from elsewhere. The translation "bureau" was chosen in order to differentiate that item from the numerous other terms for chest or trunk mentioned in the Geniza and serving the same purpose. It is likely that the muqaddama was a chest with drawers, but this has not yet been definitely established.</page><page sequence="24">100 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN tons,90 and the minshafa, or bathrobe, probably decorated with trinkets, as was the case in later times. Furnishings "Spreads and hangings" was the term for that section of the trousseau which we called for short "bedding."9' The various sofas, couches, and divans which formed such a prominent part of the bride's outfit were not pieces of furniture, but rather heavy textiles and items of upholstery which were, or were not, put on some cheap structure of wood or wickerwork. Only exceptionally one would read in a ketubba that a bride brought in a bed of ebony wood92 Or a bench of Indian oak, or teak.93 Pads to be put on a divan, mattresses of different make, valuable bead covers and wraps com- pleted the "beddings." There was no "bedroom" called by this name in a Geniza house. Even in the most detailed descriptions of a house I have never encountered such a term, nor have I found one elsewhere in the descriptions of houses in Egypt. In winter, one slept in a small closet which could be easily heated with a brazier; in summer one preferred a large room with good ventilation. The "two chameleon-colored canopies," or bed awnings, worth sixty dinars, brought in by our rich bride, probably were put up only in winter. Only a few other ketubbas have this costly item, and then it is always only one canopy (albeit, in one case, listed as being worth 100 dinars).94 Tableware in silver was rare. They did not use forks and spoons (one "drank" the soup). A common item was the marfa', the silver or brass con- tainer of fluids standing on the table, accompanied by a ladle, or large silver spoon. There was a great variety of table and kitchenware in brass and cop- 90. Why then did they not use buttons for clothing? Human inventions have their peculiar ways. The so-called Arabic numerals were never applied by the Arabs to daily use. They served science, not commerce. The Near Eastern merchants learned the use of Arabic numerals from Europe. 91. See Doc.

In view of this, I refrain from commenting on this item. Many of these objects were imported. Among others, the rich bride of Fustat brought in two brass lamps from Spain; the Karaite girl of Jerusalem possessed items in copper from Baghdad and Damascus. To be sure, the textiles were largely of inter- national provenance. It is hard to tell whether there was anything specifically Jewish in the outfits of the brides discussed above. The veils, cloaks, and wraps worn by women while going out differed widely in their colors. Thus there was no specific Jewish, Samaritan, or Christian color as in later times. In general, the discriminatory laws concerning the clothing of the non-Muslims were not enforced in the Fatimid period. There is no reason to assume that the Arabic terms used by the Jews were different from those in vogue in their en- vironment or that the pieces of clothing designated by these terms were dif- ferent in make. For most of these objects appear also in letters as bought or sold on the markets. Whether there were any specific traits in the selection of pieces and the composition of the outfit, we cannot say, since we do not have Christian or Muslim lists similar to those discussed above. As is known from Geniza finds and other sources, women dedicated Torah scrolls to synagogues. A Torah scroll was kept in a wooden container often overlaid with silver, and was decorated with a silver crown, silver chains, and ramdmin (Heb. rimm6nmm), "pomegranates," that is, spheric or- naments of silver, occasionally gilded, and sometimes embellished by water lilies wrought of the same material. Not a few of the precious metals accom- panying a young woman to her husband's house, to embellish her looks, after having done their service, might have been turned into ornaments for the Torah.95 Furthermore, the walls and columns of the synagogues were covered with precious textiles-exactly the same that appear in the trousseau lists. An elderly woman, after having taken care of the outfits of her daughters 95. See S. D.

Numerous wills of women with such dispositions have been preserved. And the very first item of textiles donated to the synagogue of the Iraqians in Fustat in 1080, that is, after the terrible times of anarchy and pil- lage through which Egypt had gone, was "a robe of siglaton, yellow and ... , a new one, from the house of Saniy al-Dawla, on which is written: To the Synagogue of the Iraqians." "House" means "wife," and "written" means "embroidered." A new, unused, piece from a trousseau, perhaps originally earmarked by the proprietress as her burial dress, had as its final destination the House of God.96 Finally, the real estate brought in by a woman at her marriage, or, rather, a part of it, often was donated or willed by her to the community for the maintenance of the poor or the upkeep of a synagogue, especially for the oil needed to illuminate the building for nightly study. I was particularly impressed by this detail in an Arabic deed of conveyance from April 1260 describing the boundaries of a valuable piece of property in the Zuwayla quarter (then a Jewish neighborhood) of Cairo: "East-the house known by the name of Nishi'a, the daughter of Ibrahfm, son of Sa'fd, the Jew, known today as the Synagogue."97 Two hundred and fifty years at least prior to this document there was already a synagogue in the newly founded imperial city of Cairo.98 But the increasing number of the Jewish residents of Fustat, the ancient capital of Islamic Egypt, who had moved to the new city, required additional houses 96.

Three Jewish government officials, bear- ing the title Saniy al-Dawla ("High-ranking") are known to me: Moses ha-Kohen, active around 1080 (TS 10 J 6, fol. 5, 1. 11; TS 16.188); Abu 'l-Munajjl, Solomon Ibn Sha'ya, promi- nent around 1110 (see Mann, Jews in Egypt, 1:215-17); and Moses ha-Levi b. Japheth, living around 1170 (TS 12.104, TS 16.208, etc.). Here, the first is intended. 97. D. S. Richards, "Arabic Documents from the Karaite Community in Cairo," Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 15 (1972): 109. Since part of the building whose boundaries were described in the document was donated in 1324 (that is, sixty-four years after the original purchase) to the poor of the Karaites, it is likely, but not certain, that the syn- agogue referred to was a Karaite place of prayer. Another synagogue donated by a woman was "the upper synagogue," or rather four syn- agogues on the third floor of four adjacent houses willed by Elea Nomico to the Jewish com- munity of Candia, Crete, in 1432; see David Jacoby, "Quelques aspects de la vie juive en Crete dans la premiere moiti6 du xve si&amp;cle," Kritologikon Synedrion (Athens, 1974), pp. 113-16. 98. See Mediterranean Society, 2:243.</page><page sequence="27">TROUSSEAUX FROM THE FATIMID PERIOD 103 of prayer. One such place was donated or willed by this woman.99 Thus we see that the relative independence gained by Jewish women through their dowry provided them also with the means for good deeds. 99. However, the kanisat al-mu'allima, literally, "the synagogue of the school mistress," given as an address in a Geniza letter, was not a house of prayer dedicated by her, but rather the place where she taught. She is mentioned elsewhere; see ibid., vol. 3, chap. D., n. 204.</page><page sequence="28">104 SHELOMO DOV GOITEIN APPENDIX Text of Document Two* 1146 1201--I'00 ,1111. ' n1t Bodl.
