<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ronald H. Miller. Dialogue and Disagreement: Franz Rosenzweig's Rele- vance to Contemporary Jewish-Christian Understanding. Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1989. xix, 213 pp. Ronald Miller, a Catholic lay theologian, is concerned to challenge his church to a more intensive, more dialogic encounter with Judaism and the Jewish people. Like such Christian theologians as Paul M. Van Buren, he turns to Franz Rosenzweig for a construction of a possible, if not ideal, rela- tionship between the two religious communities. Miller uses Rosenzweig's understanding of revelation as a means of unlocking that thinker's signifi- cance for the contemporary relationship of Christians and Jews. His book has two aims: to explore Rosenzweig's view of revelation on its own terms, and to use that view, together with Rosenzweig's explicit writings on Chris- tianity, for a contemporary Christian theology of dialogue. Miller's work, in keeping with the style of Rosenzweig's famous cor- respondence with Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy and Rudolph and Hans Ehrenburg, is deeply personal. Miller writes in the first person and speaks of his meetings with Rosenzweig's widow, Edith, and with Jewish scholars such as Nahum Glatzer. Miller is convinced that in order to understand Rosenzweig, one must apply him to one's own situation. One must become a Sprachdenker and practice "speech thinking." The Rosenzweigian princi- ples of dialogue are: (1) Dialogue is a fluid "journey of discovery" (Rosen- zweig uses this term in a letter to Hans Ehrenburg to describe what has been lacking in his dialogue with Eugen Rosenstock) rather than a "duel" (which is what Rosenstock turned their dialogue into) because truth, which is</page><page sequence="2">340 BOOK REVIEWS always someone's truth, is articulated by earthbound, historical men and women. Truth is "existential." It is embedded in the particularity of history. It emerges in the living flow of our conversational speech. Hence, we must cultivate the openness to discover another's truthful speech by suspending those presuppositions which categorize the other before the other has truly spoken. (2) Openness thus requires that the other's self-definition be respected. We must not impose categories on the other which the other resists or rejects. (3) Openness requires the willingness to change one's own perspective. For Miller, Rosenzweig's understanding of Christianity and his dia- logues with Christians such as Rosenstock and the Ehrenburgs exemplify these principles. Radical openness, forming oneself and being formed within the ongoing conversation (that is, being a Sprachdenker), is required by the way in which truth is revealed to us. Openness to the other is as much (or more) an ontic requirement as a moral imperative. Miller's reading of the Star, the correspondence, and the various essays is sensitive and well-informed. In my view, however, his emphasis on open- ness as the red thread which ties all of Rosenzweig together leads to at least two distortions. First, although Miller fully recognizes the different roles that Judaism and Christianity play in history (according to Rosenzweig), he tends to see them as two species of the same genus. He refers to them both as "covenant communities" (e.g., pp. 108-109). Yet Rosenzweig is not a covenantal theologian. While he very occasionally uses the terms Bund and Bundnis, he uses such terms as Gemeinschaft, Volk, and ecclesia more often. American theologians take covenantalism for granted and read it into thinkers where it is not a major motif. The ontological differences between Judaism and Christianity, although noted by Miller, are underemphasized due to his personalist and existen- tialist reading. His emphasis is on the Jewish or Christian individual. In Jacob Fleischmann's Hebrew study of Rosenzweig, by contrast, the radical- ly different ways in which Jews and Christians qua communities experience time become a fundamental explanatory category. The metaphysical mebitza between the two groups looms higher for Fleischmann than for Miller.' The second distortion is methodological. Miller continues in the Glatzer 1.

In both his biographical and his expositional chapters, he neglects the historical task of contextualizing Rosenzweig and identifying and critiquing his use of sources. Miller does not at all explore Rosenzweig's indebtedness to Schelling, Goethe, or Nietzsche. Nor does he see him against the back- drop of Frankfurt Jewry. He presents him, rather, in saintlike isolation, with little relation to a time or place. A final problem with this sort of treatment has been raised by David Novak in his recent Jewish-Christian Dialogue: A Jewish Justification. Novak argues that Rosenzweig's image of Christianity-a "Judaism for Gentiles," dependent upon Judaism for its energy and authenticity-cannot possibly correspond to the way in which Christians view themselves Thus Rosenzweig's construct of Christianity fails to satisfy the criterion of open- ness to the self-definition of the other which Rosenzweig himself (on Miller's account) advocates.2 Agreeing with Novak, I do not see how the ideal-typical characterization of Christianity, to which Rosenzweig is highly committed, can be squared with a situational ethic of dialogic openness, to which Miller is highly committed. These problems notwithstanding, Miller's work is a helpful, readable introduction to both Rosenzweig and the literature of the contemporary Jewish-Christian dialogue.
