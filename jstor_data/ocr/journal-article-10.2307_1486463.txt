<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS OF THE HALAKHIC SOURCES by MOSHE SOKOL I What is Jewish ethics? Is there a distinct academic discipline under the rubric of "Jewish studies" or "Jewish philosophy" which can properly be called "Jewish ethics"? The answer to these two related questions is more elusive than one might think. Indeed, it has recently been argued that there really is no such thing as Jewish ethics at all.' On the one hand, if a principle of action is truly ethical, then it must be universal, and if it is universal, it cannot be distinctively Jewish. On the other hand, if Jewish ethics is really halakhah in disguise, as so many writers in the field of medical ethics, for 1. Menachem Kellner, "Reflections on the Impossibility of Jewish Ethics," Bar-Ilan 22-23 (1987). 63</page><page sequence="2">64 MOSHE SOKOL example, seem to believe, then why bother with the disguise if one can get the real thing? While it would be impossible, in the context of this essay, to chart a full- fledged theoretical course that would carry us safely past this Scylla and Charybdis of Jewish ethics,2 these problems in a sense constitute the essay's subtext. What I shall in effect be proposing here is one way of doing Jewish ethics (amongst others) that, it seems to me, slips between the two disciplin- ary perils. My treatment of the problem of allocating scarce medical resources, quite apart from its critical importance, is thus intended to be a case study in a particular approach to the enterprise of Jewish ethics. The methodology advocated here involves the analysis of classical Jewish texts, largely of a halakhic nature, in light of moral theory. Broadly speaking (I shall formulate this more precisely below), the idea is to use moral theory to explain in some sense the positions taken by the halakhic sources. In so doing, Jewish ethics is engaged not as a normative enterprise, in which context the issues raised above become problematic, but rather as an explanatory enterprise that uses the philosophical tools of modern ethical theory. But is this legitimate? Is it legitimate to use the categories of modern ethi- cal theory to explain ancient or medieval texts, whose authors clearly could not have thought in terms of these new categories? Doesn't modern his- torical consciousness preclude the sort of textual interpretation characteris- tic of, for example, the medieval Jewish philosophers, who used Greek phi- losophical categories to explain biblical texts, an enterprise very similar to the one proposed here? While this question too cannot be fully treated in the context of this essay, it does require at least some attention. Classical texts of any period may be approached from a variety of per- spectives. The philologist has one set of concerns, the form-critical analyst quite another. The social historian asks certain kinds of questions, the intel- lectual historian others. No one of these approaches has an intellectual monopoly; each contributes in its own way to the fullest possible under- standing of the text. Indeed, no approach is entirely self-sufficient. The intellectual historian who ignores the findings of the philologist does so at his own peril. 2. For a somewhat fuller treatment of the question, see my article "Jewish Ethics" in The Encyclopedia of Ethics (New York: Garland Publishing Co., forthcoming).</page><page sequence="3">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 65 The methodology employed here is philosophical and jurisprudential in character. The philosopher or jurisprude who analyzes a legal text makes no direct historical or philological claims about the text, although the tools of such analyses will certainly be used where they are available. Rather, the aim of this interpreter is to explain the text, by recourse to philosophical or jurisprudential theories, distinctions, and concepts. Of course, the notion of "explanation" here itself needs explanation. Do we mean by explaining a text the recovery of the author's original intent? Recent hermeneutic theory has shown just how difficult, if not impossible, all attempts at recovering an author's intent are. This general hermeneutic problem is multiplied a hun- dredfold if what one seeks to do in the explanatory process is employ the latest legal or philosophical theory in understanding an ancient rabbi's teachings. Clearly, the categories and concepts of contemporary theory are entirely outside the pale of his intellectual framework, no matter how bril- liant he might have been. One could argue, then, that the traditional acade- mic disciplines of jurisprudence, and of the history of philosophy generally, are defeated by the demon of anachronism. Elsewhere I have taken this point up, and noted that even historical treatments of texts seek to explain authorial positions by recourse to his- torical forces of which the author may have been entirely ignorant.3 His- torical forces often operate outside the pale of human awareness. In that essay I suggest that the philosophical explanation of a text is modeled after the scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon: in both instances, the researcher seeks to account for the data at his disposal-in the one case, the results of scientific experiments, in the other, statements made by the same author-by recourse to an explanatory theory. Textual explanation, on this view, is largely justificatory; that is, the philosopher or jurisprude will "explain" Rabbi Akiva's assertion by justifying it. Certain concepts or theories will be trotted forward to show just how much sense Rabbi Akiva's position makes. Such an effort is further strengthened by the scope of the explanatory theory-by the extent to which it is able to account for other statements Rabbi Akiva or members of his school might have made. This account, however, needs further refinement, since, in an important sense, it leaves Rabbi Akiva curiously out of the picture. A theory might be 3. "Some Tensions in the Jewish Attitude Toward the Taking of Human Life," Jewish Law Annual 7 (1988): 97.</page><page sequence="4">66 MOSHE SOKOL resoundingly successful in justifying Rabbi Akiva's views, and it may even have the requisite scope, yet if we know on other grounds that Rabbi Akiva would likely have vigorously denied it were he asked (for example, because it assumes theological positions which an ancient rabbi would likely have regarded as heretical), then there ought to be something seriously wrong with applying the theory to Rabbi Akiva. Yet, as formulated above, there wouldn't be. I would like to suggest here that the link to Rabbi Akiva may be at the level of pretheoretic intuitions. Underlying most-probably all-complex philosophical or jurisprudential theories are certain fundamental, undif- ferentiated intuitions. The natural law theorist has one way of looking at the law, the legal positivist quite another. These basic intuitions can be formu- lated in one or another of the countless ways in which natural law theory or legal positivism have been put forward over the years. These complications arise as the theorist seeks to make the theory ever more responsive to a growing body of empirical data, logical or philosophical arguments, and more nuanced or deeper theoretical concepts. While these complications and the differences between formulations are often critical, the point which should be emphasized is that in many instances, at the deepest and most fun- damental level, they are variations on a single intuitive theme. Sometimes, of course, the different formulations themselves reflect different intuitions. But in any case, it is the intuition which gives rise to what often becomes a highly complex and exceedingly sophisticated theory. While the concept of a pre- theoretic intuition itself requires further analysis (What, exactly, is it? What is its relation to the linguistic categories needed for its formulation? What is the precise relation between a pretheoretic intuition and the theory which is its articulation?), it seems fair to say that most of us have-if the word may be used-an intuitive grasp of the concept. For our purposes here, this will have to suffice. Thus, attributing a sophisticated theory to an ancient source is not anachronistic if the theory is an attempt to formulate and capture certain fundamental legal or philosophical intuitions, and if those intuitions are such as could have been held by the ancient source. This is, of course, pro- vided that the explainer is not claiming that the source actually intended, or could have intended, the modern formulation. In brief, the position proposed here is that a classical source is well explained by a modern theory to the extent that the explanation satisfies three conditions:</page><page sequence="5">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 67 1. The theory justifies the source, showing why one would want to take the position it takes. 2. The theory has scope, in that it provides an explanatory framework linking up numerous assertions by the source, or members of his school. 3. The theory is a successful formulation of an intuition or set of intu- itions about the issue in question, such that the source could have had those intuitions. Where there is independent evidence that the source did have such intuitions, the explanation is commensurately strength- ened. While this concept of explanation, and the methodology it suggests, has been only cursorily sketched here, I shall assume it for the remainder of this paper, if only so that we can proceed to its more substantive aspects.4 This concern for methodological issues should not obscure the enor- mous practical significance of the problem itself. With the advent of all kinds of new experimental medications, organ transplant procedures, and exotic technologies, the question of how these are to be allocated is of acute contemporary importance. Where there are two candidates for a liver trans- plant and only one liver, or where there are two AIDS victims who are candidates for a limited supply of AZT, who is the lucky one, and who dies? 4. See B. Jackson, ed., Modern Research in Jewish Law (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1980) for discus- sions of some methodological issues in Mishpat Ivri. Note in particular the articles by Jackson and Albeck, who draw a parallel between the methodology of Mishpat Ivri and that of the lin- guist, who formulates rules of grammar as an interpretation of the linguistic intuitions of speakers. This is analogous, too, to moral epistemology, where the moral epistemologist seeks to account for moral intuitions through ethical theory. In stressing the condition of justification I am veering somewhat from this approach. The question of interpreting ancient texts is of course different from interpreting the putative intuitions of some hypothetical moral agent, as it is different from interpreting the linguistic conventions of the speaker who stakes out no posi- tion on anything at all, but merely uses the language. For a sophisticated contemporary account of legal interpretation, see Ronald Dworkin's Law's Empire (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986). Dworkin stresses what I call here the justificatory role of interpretation, although in a somewhat different way, drawing upon recent hermeneutic theory. See in particular chaps. 2 and 6-10.</page><page sequence="6">68 MOSHE SOKOL The problem, of course, is not dependent upon new technologies. Where two accident victims arrive in the emergency room, and there is only one physician available, a classic case of triage, who gets the scarce medical resource-the physician's attention? The problem as formulated here is one of micro-allocation, selecting from amongst individuals who will live and who will die. There is another level to the problem as well, what has been called the macro-allocation question. How should society at large allocate its health care resources? What percentage of the GNP should be directed toward health care? Should more funds be invested in preventive medicine, in curing exotic diseases, or in making CAT scans available to all community hospitals? This essay will focus only on the micro- rather than the macro-allocation problem. One final point concerning the scope of this paper. By far the most common micro-allocation problems involve a third party, normally a physician, sometimes a health care team or committee, which allocates the scarce medi- cal resource. While this point seems obvious, discussions of the problem in the halakhic context sometimes go astray here, since a good many of the original halakhic sources (such as the travelers case below) involve only two parties. This consideration limits the range of applicable halakhic sources only to those which bear on third-party allocation questions, and hence provides a greater focus to this study. The rabbinic and medieval sources, perhaps not surprisingly, do not address the question directly. Nevertheless, two important morally isomor- phic analogues do exist within the halakhic tradition. The first source is one of the classic "life-for-life" texts in the halakhah, the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Ben Petura concerning two people traveling on the road with only enough water for one of them. The Talmud records the story as fol- lows: Two people were traveling on the road, and one of them has a flask of water. If both drink, they will both die; if one drinks he will arrive at the town. Ben Petura expounded [darash]: it is better that they both drink and die, and one of them not witness the death of his companion. Until Rabbi Akiva came and taught, "and your brother shall live with you" [Lev. 25:36]. Your life takes precedence over the life of your brother.5 5. B.T. Baba Mezia 62b.</page><page sequence="7">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 69 We shall return to this text shortly. The second set of sources appears in the context of pidyon shevu'yim or zedakka, and relates to the last mishnayot in Horayot. A man takes precedence over a woman when it comes to saving a life and to restoring something lost. A woman takes precedence with regard to provision of clothes and to be redeemed from captivity. When both stand equal chances of being degraded, then the man takes precedence over the woman. A kohen takes precedence over a levi; a levi to a yis'rael; a yis'rael to a mamzer; a mamzer to a ne'sin; a ne'sin to a convert; a convert to a free slave. When [do we say this]? When they are all equal. But if there were a talmid hakham mamzer and a ko'hen gadol am ha'aretz, the mamzer talmid hakham takes precedence.6 There is much to say about these mishnayot, which I shall reserve until later. Before beginning an analysis of these sources, however, a brief com- ment about their interrelationship is in order. Should the system of priorities outlined in Horayot (and related halakhic material not yet mentioned) apply to the dilemma of the travelers? None of the major talmudic commentaries suggest that it should. Why not? One possible answer has to do with ownership. In the travelers case, one of the endangered persons owns the scarce resource. In the Horayot context, we appear to be dealing with a third party who wishes to allocate scarce funds to save a captive or who wishes to save one of two people drowning in a river.7 While this is a distinction of the first importance, according to cer- tain interpretations of the travelers case dispute, it is not relevant, as we shall see. A second distinction, whose significance is not often realized, concerns whether the resource is physically divisible. A quantity of water can be div- ided in two, and each person can drink half. However, only one person can be redeemed from captivity, there is no half redemption, as there is no half salvation from the raging waters of the river. For the purposes of this paper, this distinction will be taken as basic, and the analysis proposed here will be organized around it. In dealing with the travelers case, we shall in effect be dealing with the allocation of divisible scarce resources. 6. Horayot 3:7-8. 7. See Bet Yoseph, Yoreh De'ah 251, s.v. ma she'katab.</page><page sequence="8">70 MOSHE SOKOL The first question that must be addressed is whether or not Ben Petura's view should be taken as a halakhic pesak. Aaron Enker, in an extremely provocative chapter on life-for-life issues in halakhic sources in his book Hekhrekh ve-Zorech be-Dinei Onshin,8 has suggested that Ben Petura's posi- tion is moral rather than halakhic in nature. That Ben Petura uses the lan- guage "it is better that they both drink and die" suggests moral advice, not pesak halakha. This point is further buttressed by the fact that the Rambam, Tur, and Shulhan A rukh delete the law, and that the Maharsha cites it in his hiddushei aggadot rather than in his hiddushei halakhot. If this suggestion is correct, then we really have only one view in halakhah, that of Rabbi Akiva. As will be seen, this point would make some difference in our analysis. While this suggestion is surely an interesting one, it is far from decisive. Insofar as this story is reflected in the halakhic sources, Ben Petura's posi- tion is taken by all the sources to be legal in character. Moreover, and of special significance, the parallel passage to this talmudic debate which appears in Sifra, cited by Enker, suggests otherwise.9 As Enker himself notes, the phrase "it is better that" is not used. Rather, Ben Petura is quoted as saying simply, "they should both drink and die." At least Sifra's version of the debate suggests that Ben Petura's position is legal. It seems safe to assume then, with most commentators, that the argu- ment, at least for Sifra, is halakhic. The question we must now address is: What are they arguing about? What precisely is the logic behind each of the positions? Neither R. Akiva nor Ben Petura explains himself, and so if we are to analyze the text with an eye to getting at a Jewish view of the alloca- tion of scarce medical resources, we must turn to the halakhic tradition itself. How did the halakhic sources understand the debate, bracketing for our purpose the question of whether the text itself means those under- standings. My own survey of the sources revealed at least five and perhaps six dif- ferent interpretations of the R. Akiva-Ben Petura debate.1' While many are 8. Ramat Gan: Bar-llan University Press, 1977. 9.

The first interpretation is that of the great nineteenth-century scholar Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (known as the Ne'tziv)." Rabbi Abraham Karel- itz, popularly known as the Hazon Ish, one of the leading twentieth- century halakhists, appears to take this position as well in one of his works.'2 They understand the debate to revolve around the following issue: Suppose A and B are at risk of their lives, and one of two actions, X or Y, can be performed to assist them, either by A or B themselves, or by some third party, C. If X is performed, then the lives of both A and B will be temporarily extended. If Y is performed, then the life of one of them will be permanently saved and the other will face immediate doom. Which is the better choice? Is it better to extend two lives temporarily or to save one life permanently, even where doing so results in the immediate death of the other? Rabbi Akiva, on this explanation, is of the view that it is better to per- manently preserve one life, even if at the expense of the other, and thus only one should drink. Ben Petura is of the view that it is better to temporarily extend the lives of both, and therefore both should drink. In the words of the Ne'tziv, explaining Ben Petura, "if both drink, at least they will both live another day or two ... and perhaps by then water will be found."'3 As formulated, the logic of the argument is such that it makes no differ- ence whether A, B, or some third party, C, is in possession of the water: Rabbi Akiva's reasoning, that only one should drink, would apply no mat- ter who had possession of the water, as would Ben Petura's reasoning, that both should have a temporary extension of life. Possession is relevant only in determining which of the two should drink; were Ben Petura to agree with Rabbi Akiva's basic logic, that only one should drink, then he too might well agree that it should be the owner of the water who does the drinking. At issue between them is whether one drinks or two drinks, not whether the owner drinks or they both drink. 11. Ha'amek She'ela, She'ilta 147:3. 12. See Hoshen Mishpat, Bava Me'tzia, Likutim 20, p. 62a. In his comments on R. Chaim Soloveitchik's Hiddushei GRA H al ha-Rambam, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah, however, he seems to take another view. See R. Shmuel Vosner, Responsa Shevet ha-Levi, vol. 6, resp. 242. 13. Shelah, par. 147.</page><page sequence="10">72 MOSHE SOKOL The Hazon Ish in his volume on Hoshen Mishpat is quite explicit in asserting that the debate between Rabbi Akiva and Ben Petura is neutral on the question on ownership: "And it appears that if one person has water, and before him are two people dying of thirst, this too depends upon the dispute [between Rabbi Akiva and Ben Petura]."'4 This analysis of the dispute yields the conclusion that the question of micro-allocating divisible scarce medical resources depends upon the Rabbi Akiva-Ben Petura dispute. Since most are of the view that the halakhah fol- lows Rabbi Akiva,'5 only one would receive, say, the scarce medication. Later we shall take up the question of which of the two persons in need of the medication receives it. Before proceeding with our analysis, one final point should be made. On the face of it, Rabbi Akiva's view makes good common sense: after all, why should both die, when at least one can live? The likelihood that additional water will be found in the middle of a desert, or that more AZT will be miraculously made available, is remote. Aren't we sacrificing one human life for poor odds? In short, Ben Petura's position, according to this interpreta- tion of the dispute, is in need of explanation. The second interpretation of the debate relevant to the allocation of scarce medical resources question is that of one of the leading early-twenti- eth-century poskim, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski.'6 Rabbi Eliezer Wal- denberg, one of the most influential contemporary poskim in the field of medical halakhah, arrived at a similar conclusion, apparently independent- ly.'7 This analysis (particularly as formulated by Rabbi Waldenberg) takes as its starting point an observation of Rabbi Shmuel Edels, in his late-six- teenth-century talmudic commentary,'8 to the effect that if A and B were partners in the water, then Rabbi Akiva would agree with Ben Petura that the water should be split between them. Rabbis Grodzinski and Waldenberg reason that Rabbi Akiva and Ben Petura disagree only where one of the two parties owns the water; at issue between them is whether property rights are morally relevant in life-and-death situations. The verse ve-hai ahikha im'kha teaches Rabbi Akiva that A's ownership of the water is morally rele- 14. Ibid. 15. See Rif, Rosh, and Me'iri ad loc., in Baba Me'zia. 16.

Baba Me'zia 62b.</page><page sequence="11">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 73 vant, and thus that A keeps it. Ben Petura denies the moral relevance of ownership in life-and-death situations; therefore, for Ben Petura, A and B stand in morally equivalent positions with respect to the water, and they must split it. However, where A and B indisputably stand equal with respect to the water, i.e., where A and B are partners in the water, or where neither A nor B owns the water, then both would agree that the water must be split.'9 A similar halakhic result, although for somewhat different reasons, is main- tained by Rabbi Zadok ha-Cohen of Lublin in the nineteenth century,20 and apparently by the Hazon Ish himself, in another treatment of the same sub- ject.2' The direct relevance of this analysis to the allocation of divisible scarce medical resources is obvious. Neither patient A nor patient B owns the scarce medication. C, the physician, would thus be obligated, according to both Rabbi Akiva and Ben Petura, to apportion the medication equally. Let us consider the implications of this pesak. C, the physician, has four alternatives: 1. He can give all the medication to A. 2. He can give all the medication to B. 3. He can split it between A and B. 4. He can withhold it from both A and B. If C withholds the medication, then both A and B will die soon, say in three hours. If he splits the medication between them, they will both gain a limited reprieve, say they will both live another twelve hours, and then die. If, on the other hand, he gives it all to either A or B, then one will die in three hours and the other will live until 120. Common sense would seem to dictate that C should give all the medication to one of them. After all, if he divides it, then both will get only a short reprieve, whereas if one gets all he will lead a long and blessed life. Nevertheless, according to this authoritative interpre- tation of the debate everyone would agree that the water/medication must be split. Indeed, some of the most influential of twentieth-century poskim take 19. Rabbi Grodzinski relates this to the question in B.T. Baba Kamma 60b concerning sav- ing oneself with someone else's money, and the interpretation of Rashi and the Tosafists ad loc. 20. Ozar ha-Melekh, Yesodei ha-Torah 5:5. 21. Gilyonot le-Hiddushei R. Hayim ha-Levi, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah (B'nei Brak, 1974).</page><page sequence="12">74 MOSHE SOKOL precisely this view.22 This compounds the puzzle raised earlier in discussing the interpretation of the Ne'tziv. If this is counterintuitive, imagine the following: A is a high priest and talmid hakham, a family man and pillar of society. B, on the other hand, is an unmarried drug addict. To whom must C give the medication? None of the poskim cited above make such distinctions. Where the life-saving resource can be split, it must be split even if someone as distinguished as A must lose his life. What explanation can there be for this striking pesak? I would suggest that underlying this thesis is an insight of some signifi- cance for halakhah and Jewish ethics. To see this, we must temporarily leave halakhic analysis and consider aspects of general ethical theory. III Normative ethics is split down the middle by a great debate between teleologists and deontologists.23 Teleologists (or, as they are sometimes called, consequentialists) maintain that the moral rightness or wrongness of an action is determined exclusively by its consequences, i.e., by the nonmoral good or evil it produces. For example, utilitarianism, the most popular form of teleologism, holds that it is happiness which is the nonmoral good by which the morality of an action is measured. If an action maximizes the sum total of happiness in the world over its alternatives, then it is moral; if it reduces the sum total of happiness in the world relative to its alternatives, then it is immoral. The action in question has no moral features in itself; its morality derives exclusively from what it does in the world. To put it differ- ently, actions are not moral ends in themselves; they are only means to pro- ducing some moral (or immoral) end. Deontologists, on the other hand (or, as they are sometimes called, abso- lutists), maintain that actions are in themselves moral ends; that certain 22. In addition to the authorities cited in the text, see also R. Moshe Shternbukh, Responsa Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot (Jerusalem, 1986), Hoshen Mishpat, resp. 858 (pp. 301-302), who takes the same view. A contrary position is taken by Rabbi Y. Unterman, in Shevat Yehuda (Jerusa- lem, 1955) p. 18, and Rabbi Moshe S. Shapira in R. Moshe Shmuel ve-Doro (New York, 1964), p. 236. 23. This exposition of the teleologist/deontologist debate is drawn from my article "Some Tensions in the Jewish Attitude Toward the Taking of Human Life."</page><page sequence="13">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 75 features of the action itself make it right or wrong. Thus, on this view, an action is moral if it is just, keeps a promise, or is truthful. Acting justly is good not because it has wonderful consequences for society; it is good because it has the property of being just, or of conformity to the moral law "Act justly!" In Kantian terms, the action is good if performed out of respect for the moral law, which requires that all humans be treated not only as means to some end, but as ends in themselves. Deontologists take considerations of justice, responsiveness to the moral claims of interpersonal choice situations, and respect for human worth and dignity with radical seriousness. That an action has good consequences for society, or generally maximizes life, is far less important-according to some views, not inherently important at all-than the moral properties of the action itself. In a very perceptive article, Thomas Nagel suggests that the difference between the two positions involves more than abstract moral theory.24 Rather, the difference, he suggests, is grounded in fundamentally differing conceptions of what it is to be a moral being operating in human society. Specifically: [Deontologism] is associated with a view of oneself as a small being interacting with others in a large world. The justifications it requires are primarily inter- personal. Utilitarianism is associated with a view of oneself as a benevolent bureaucrat distributing such benefits as one can control to countless other beings with whom one may have various relations or none. The justifications it requires are primarily administrative. The argument between the two may depend upon the priority of these two conceptions. According to Nagel, then, what is at stake in the deontologist/teleologist debate is no less than our conception of the very essence of moral agency. The relevance of this debate to the travelers case-and to the allocation of divisible scarce medical resources-should be clear. My claim is that deontological ethical theory provides an excellent account of the final hala- khic position according to Rabbis Grodzinski and Waldenberg and others, and of the position of Ben Petura, according to the Ne'tziv. The physician is faced with two morally equivalent claims. Justice, says 24. Thomas Nagel, "War and Massacre, Philosophy and Public Affairs 1, no. 2 (1972): 123-144.</page><page sequence="14">76 MOSHE SOKOL the deontologist, would require treating them equally. Treating the two of them equally means dividing the medication, despite the fact that in doing so each will live only a few more hours. To the teleologist, this is foolish: providing all the medication only to one would enable him to live a full life. Dividing the medication would thus violate the principle "Maximize life!" The deontologist argues, on the other hand, that this principle is a bureau- cratic abstraction, imported from outside the choice situation, and is not responsive to the immediate and equal claims of A and B. Despite the con- sequences of dividing the medication, divide it the physician must. Thus, deontological considerations lead naturally to the halakhic positions dis- cussed above.25 One final point should be made here, about the opposition. Those that disagree with the view explained here as deontological, i.e., those that main- tain that the medication should be allocated only to one of the two needy persons, could of course be said to be taking a teleological position. This is perhaps the most obvious interpretation. It should be noted, however, that they might also hold some sort of blend of the two theories, a position some recent ethicists have sought to maintain. As will be seen in the final section of this paper, even those who maintain that the resource should be di- vided-the view explained here as deontological-do not adopt a pure deontologism. In order to see why this is so, however, we must proceed with our analysis. IV Up until now we have considered the question of allocating divisible scarce resources. What happens when the life-saving resource is indivisible, 25. See my "Some Tensions in the Jewish Attitude Toward the Taking of Human Life" for other instances in Jewish sources in which the teleologist/deontologist debate may be reflected. Note also Ramakh's puzzle, cited in Keseph Mishna, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah 5:5, as to why, according to Rambam, following the Tosephta and Resh Lakish in the Yerushal- mi, if heathens come upon a group of Jews, and threaten the lives of the entire group unless they turn over a particular-guiltless-individual, the law is that they must all lose their lives rather than turn over the individual. As Ramakh and many others point out, this seems remarkably counterintuitive: why sacrifice so many lives, when by turning over the individual everyone else can be saved? Here, too, deontological considerations help account for this position, and other related sources.</page><page sequence="15">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 77 when there is only one heart available for transplant, or time enough to save only one person from drowning in the river?26 It is here, I would argue, that the prioritization hierarchies found in the rabbinic sources, most notably the mishnayot in Horayot, and those found in the poskim come into play. That is, considerations such as yihus or sex are relevant only where the resource in question cannot be divided between, for example, the kohen and the yis'rael. Where the resource can be divided, however, such considerations are irrelevant. My argument for this claim is twofold. First, with respect to the travelers case, where the resource is divisible, the poskim who maintain that the water should be split do not, at least in that context, suggest that yihus or sex is relevant to deciding the allocation. Second, with respect to the sugya in Horayot, the Bet Yoseph cited earlier (n. 7) specifically asserts that when the mishna speaks of le-hahayot ("to saving a life")-i.e., life-for-life situa- tions-it refers to a case of saving one of two people drowning in a river, where the resource is obviously not divisible. Although, as we shall see, the halakhah does apply the prioritization principles to the obligation to pro- vide charity for people in need of sustenance, and normally charity funds are divisible (give one penny to each of two people in need of the meal instead of two pennies only to one), Bet Yoseph specifically asserts that such cases are not life-for-life issues. The only example he has for life-for-life issues is the case of two people drowning in the river.27 My goal in this portion of the paper is to trace the development of the prioritization hierarchies in the halakhic sources from the rabbinic period on down. I shall argue that the halakhic development here takes on a specifi- able moral shape. Since my aim is only to draw certain general conclusions about the halakhah's development, rather than to resolve in a practical way the many complex issues involved, I shall consider only the halakhah's 26. The divisibility or indivisibility of the resource of which I speak here should probably be understood functionally. That is, if the liquid medication can help each one a bit if each receives half, then the resource is divisible. If, on the other hand, the medication can be divided quanti- tively, but there is a minimum dosage such that if one takes less than that dosage he is not helped at all, then it should not be counted as divisible if the respective portions of medication fall below the effective threshold. I am grateful to Prof. Dov Frimer for this point. 27. Presumably, in a case where two people literally on the verge of death from starvation appear simultaneously before someone with only two pennies in his pocket, even for Bet Yoseph, we have a direct analogue to the travelers case/third-party allocation.</page><page sequence="16">78 MOSHE SOKOL broad contours, without attempting a fully comprehensive treatment of every relevant source. Let us begin, as we must, with the rabbinic period. An analysis of the most relevant rabbinic sources reveals that six prioritization principles oper- ate in life-for-life situations. 1. Yihus. This category leaps out at the reader from the words of the mishna in Horayot cited earlier: "A kohen takes precedence over a levi,; a levi over a yis'rael. . ." Thus, when faced with a choice between saving someone with a higher yihus value over someone with a lower yihus value, and only one of the two can be saved, then all other things being equal, the person with the higher yihus value must be saved first. Of course, the qualification "all other things being equal" is of great importance: already in the rabbinic period substantial limitations are placed on yihus as the determining factor in allocating indivisible scarce resources, as we shall soon see. 2. Social need. This category, as well as several others that follow, does not announce itself as such in the rabbinic sources. Nevertheless, certain rabbinic halakhot seem best interpreted as reflecting the categories in ques- tion. With respect to the social-need category, the Tosephta, cited in the Talmud on the mishna in Horayot quoted above, asserts that the "mashuah milhama [priest anointed as, in effect, chief chaplain of the army] takes precedence over the se'gan [vice high priest]." No explanation is given in the Tosephta itself, nor in the talmudic discussion in Horayot. Rashi, however, following the Talmud in Nazir 37b, comments ad loc. that the reason is "because the community needs him": i.e., he is necessary for successful war- ring, where the survival of the community is at stake. If this interpretation is correct, as it seems to be, the Tosephta is introducing the value of social need into the prioritization hierarchy. That the Tosephta places the king and other officials relatively high on the priority scale suggests a similar idea. There is, of course, no explicit affirmation of this as a category, and there- fore no incontrovertible evidence that the category can be applied to other instances or kinds of social need, e.g., persons valuable to society but not especially in times of war; or persons valuable to society in ways other than saving lives, such as political figures, judges, and so one. Nevertheless, gen- eralizing from mashuah milhama is surely not unreasonable. In any case, we do have evidence of the existence of the category, even if we give it the nar- rowest possible interpretation, and that is the main point. 3. Capacity for mitzvot. Here too, the rabbinic texts do not announce this as a category. Evidence for its existence, however, may be drawn from</page><page sequence="17">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 79 the mishna's assertion, cited above, that a man takes precedence over a woman for the purpose of saving a life. No explanation for this claim is pro- vided in the rabbinic period, and it is therefore difficult to know what, pre- cisely, the rabbis had in mind. The text itself is consistent with the view that gender itself is the functional category. However, the medieval commenta- tors, starting with Maimonides, explain that the reason men are preferred over women is that "men are obligated in all the mitzvot, whereas women in only some of them."28 This account of the mishnaic ruling seems most reasonable, and in ascribing the category of capacity to perform mitzvot to the rabbis (as distinct from the medievals, where it is explicit), I am assum- ing it. Here, too, we can ask whether one can generalize for the rabbinic period on the basis of this category to other kinds or instances of capacity-to- perform-mitzvot differences. Thus, faced with a choice between saving a mongoloid male and a normal male, what would the rabbis say? I would argue that the generalization is a safe one, even safer than with respect to the social-need category. The distinctions which might be drawn between the male/female and normal/abnormal choices seem far less significant than the distinctions to be drawn between mashuah milhama/vice high priest and, e.g., surgeon general/politician choices.29 4. Talmid hakham. The classical expression of the value placed upon Torah learning from the rabbinic period on down is the mishna in Horayot cited above: "A bastard learned in the Torah takes precedence over an ignorant high priest." According to biblical law, a bastard may not even marry into the Jewish community (except to another bastard), and thus with respect to yihus is at the bottm of the social barrel, particularly in light of the fact that yihus is largely a social institution whose impact is most sharp- ly felt in the context of marriage. A high priest, on the other hand, stood at the very top of the social scale during rabbinic times. Nevertheless, when faced with a choice between saving the life of an ignorant high priest and a bastard talmid hakham, the mishna teaches that the talmid hakham takes precedence. While this teaching may be understood in the historical context of the Pharisee-Sadducee conflict and the attendant Pharisaic critique of priestly corruption in Roman times, as well as the widespread distrust of the 28. Pherush ha-Mishna, ad loc. 29. Rabbi Ya'akov Emden, discussed below, draws out the same conclusions.</page><page sequence="18">80 MOSHE SOKOL am ha'aretz on the part of rabbinic scholars, its force, as well as its subse- quent impact on rabbinic Judaism, should not be underestimated. One might suggest that the category of talmid hakham should be seen as a subset of the category of social need rather than as a separate category of its own. After all, the talmid hakham performs a critical function in Jewish life: who else would teach the Jewish people the Torah and provide decisions for daily life?3" I would argue, however, that a distinction should be drawn between social utility and religious utility. The text from which the rabbinic category of social utility is derived seems best characterized as relating to specifically social rather than purely religious concerns. The category of talmid hakham, on the other hand, is clearly closer to the religious than the social, even if valued for its utility. I would also argue that the value of the talmid hakham is not merely a subset of a larger class of religious values, which would include, for example, the capacity to perform mitzvot. Rather, it seems best to construe Torah knowledge, as understood by the rabbis, as an end in itself; and hence it is best seen as a category unto itself. My argument is threefold. First, the mish- na lists the talmid hakham separately from the other categories. Secondly, throughout rabbinic literature, extraordinary value is placed on Torah knowledge and study. Third, and especially important, is a second proof- text which should be cited as evidence for the talmid hakham category in rabbinic literature: the striking comment in the Jerusalem Talmud on the mishna in Horayot attributed to R. Yehoshua b. Levi in the name of R. Hanina b. Antignos: [When faced with a choice between] the life of an am ha'aretz and clothing for the wife of a talmid hakham, clothing for the wife of the talmid hakham takes precedence over the life of the am ha'aretz, because of the dignity of the talmid hakham.3' The value of Torah knowledge is here extended even to the wife of the talmid hakham, whose mere clothing takes precedence over the very life of one ignorant of the Torah. Bracketing for present purposes the moral problem- atic of this teaching, it graphically illustrates the power of the talmid hakham value. Moreover, it suggests that the value here is just that-talmid ha- 30. See Rambam's Pherush ha-Mishna, loc. cit. 31. J.T. Horayot 3:7.</page><page sequence="19">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 81 kham-rather than religious utility generally. No similar claim is made for other religious or social values: clothing for the wife of the mashuah milha- ma, the nonignorant high priest, or the hazzan required to enable the com- munity to satisfy its prayer obligations is not given precedence over the life of an am ha'aretz.32 5. Relative degree of need. This category is derived from the mishna in Horayot. A man takes precedence over a woman when it comes to saving a life and to restoring something lost. A woman takes precedence with regard to provision of clothing and to be redeemed from captivity. When both stand equal chances of being degraded, then the man takes precedence over the woman. Degradation here refers to rape; in the case of males, the rape is homosex- ual.33 In general, the mishna teaches, a woman should be redeemed before a man because the likelihood of female rape is greater than male rape, and therefore the female stands in greater danger than the male. Where the likeli- hood of rape is equal, then the male must be redeemed first, since, as the commentators explain, it is likely that the male will experience greater anguish due to the abnormality of the act.34 The mishna thus seems to be using the criterion of relative degree of danger in determining who should be saved first: Where it is more likely that X will be harmed than Y, X is saved first. Where the probabilities are equal, other considerations are taken into account. It should be noted that the harm from which X and Y are to be saved here is not imminent death (le-hahayot) but physical and psychologi- cal harm. The prioritization scheme is here being used more broadly than in strict life-for-life situations. It should be noted here that a narrower reading of the mishna would suggest a somewhat more limited formulation of this category: instead of 32. For additional evidence of the category of talmid hakham, see: (1) Baba Me'zia 2:11, which decides that if one's father and rabbi are in captivity, the rabbi should be redeemed first, unless the father is a hakham; (2) B.T. Baba Batra 8a, where Rabbi Yehuda ha-Hanassi provid- ed food from his storage houses during a famine only to those learned in the Torah; (3) the Tosephta in Horayot, cited above, according to which saving a hakham takes precedence over saving a king. 33.

Obadiah of Bartenura (Pherush ha- Ra'av), and Tiferet Yis'rael.</page><page sequence="20">82 MOSHE SOKOL relative degree of need, we could speak of relative degree of danger. The mishna, strictly speaking, is prioritizing only in cases of imminent physical danger. Nevertheless, the category has been formulated more broadly here because there is other evidence from the rabbinic period which prioritizes on the basis of need, even where no danger is present. Thus, the following passage: Two boats that are passing in the river.... where one is loaded and the other not, the unloaded one should be preceded by the loaded one...35 Me'iri's explanation seems to be the simple reading of the text: whichever can least tolerate the delay should take precedence, just as a sick person takes precedence over a healthy person. A loaded ship normally needs to get to the port sooner, and therefore the Talmud accords it preference. A caveat must be added here: this text, as noted above, does not deal with prioritizing in cases of danger, and a distinction can in fact be made between prioritizing on the basis of need in cases of danger and prioritizing on the basis of need in other cases. It is Me'iri who makes the connection explicit; the rabbinic text itself is mute. While this is surely a possibility, the analogy between the two is so close, and the distinction mentioned above so barely significant, that the category seems best formulated as one: relative degree of need. 6. Relation to rescuer. This, the final category in the rabbinic period, derives not from the Horayot context, but from a teaching related to charity. Rav Yoseph taught: [It says] "If you lend to my nation, to the poor persons with you" [Exodus 22:26]. [When faced with a choice between] members of my nation and idol worshipers, members of my nation take precedence; a poor person and a rich person, the poor person takes precedence; your poor [i.e., relatives] and the poor of your city, your poor take precedence; the poor of your city and the poor of another city, the poor of your city take precedence.36 Rav Yoseph teaches that with respect to allocating scarce charity dollars, certain categories of persons take precedence over others. The distinction between the categories seems to hinge on the relation of members of that category to the donor, e.g., family member or resident of the same city. I 35. B.T. Sanhedrin 32b. 36. B.T. Baba Me'zia 71a.</page><page sequence="21">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 83 would argue that it is safe to generalize for the rabbis on the basis of this principle to other sorts of categories. Thus, for example, it seems reasonable to claim that according to Ray Yoseph residents of the donor's neighbor- hood take precedence over residents of another neighborhood in the same city; or, similarly, that a brother takes precedence over a first cousin.37 The same logic applies. V The categories formulated above as reflecting prioritization hierarchies in the rabbinic period undergo relatively little change through the medieval period. The categories of yihus and capacity for mitzvot remain pretty much the same. Social need, interestingly enough, is by and large not extended from ancient categories of social function such as mashuah mil- hama or king into categories meaningful to a medieval Jew, such as shtadlan or parnas. The only reflection of the category is in the discussion in the Tur as to whether a rabbi or a hazzan should be hired if the community has only enough funds to hire one of them.38 The category of relative degree of need is expanded by Ritva, who asserts that if an am ha'aretz appears to be dying of hunger during a famine, then the giver of charity is obligated to feed him even if there is a possibility that as a result of feeding the am ha'aretz there will be insufficient food for the talmid hakham. This is because the am ha'aretz is certainly in need of the food, while it is uncertain whether or not the talmid hakham will need the food.39 (Of course, where there is a certainty that there will be insufficient food for the talmid hakham, the food must be saved for the talmid hakham.) Ritva does not abstract from this ruling a general principle to the effect that where X is in definite need of some resource, and Y only possibly needs the resource, then all other things being equal, X takes precedence over Y. This generalization appears for the first time in the modern period, as we shall 37. See, for example Tur, chap. 251, where an intrafamily hierarchy is worked out, i.e., self before father and mother, who in turn take precedence over children, and so on. While this is not a rabbinic-period source, generalizing as the Tur did seems safe even as an exercise in rab- binic interpretation. 38. Ibid. 39. B.T. Baba Batra 8a.</page><page sequence="22">84 MOSHE SOKOL see. Nevertheless, his ruling is clearly a precursor to the more general princi- ple, which counts as a substantial enlarging of the scope of the relative- degree-of-need category. As noted above, the category of relation to rescuer is explicitly expanded by the Tur to include an intrafamily hierarchy,40 although, as we argued, that expansion seems implicit in the rabbinic category itself. The category of talmid hakham is extended somewhat by Maimonides, who writes in his Pherush ha-Mishna on Horayot 3:7-8 that all other categories are secondary to talmid hakham: if X is a greater hakham than Y, then X takes precedence over Y, even if Y is superior to X by any one of the many categories men- tioned in the Mishnah and Tosephta except king, father, and teacher. As Maimonides puts it in the Mishneh Torah, "Whoever is greater in wisdom takes precedence, except if one is his father or rabbi," where it makes no difference who is greater than whom provided the father is also learned. Substantial changes in the prioritization scheme first begin to emerge during the early modern period. One of the more striking changes to occur during this period relates to the category of talmid hakham, which played such a central role in the rabbinic and even medieval texts. Rabbi Moshe Isserles, in his glosses in Shulhan Arukh (251:9), codifies the Talmud Yeru- shalmi's decision that clothing for the wife of a talmid hakham takes prece- dence over the life of an am ha'aretz. Rabbi Shabsai Cohen, in his highly influential seventeenth-century commentary on Shulhan Arukh, the Shakh (251:16), asserts the following: It appears that this is according to the law. However, in these times where there is not even a talmid hakham with respect to the law of a golden liter, as above 243:7, all the more so saving a life should take precedence before him, and it is in the same category as a man in need of clothing and a woman in danger of dying, or vice-versa, where it says in the Yerushalmi that the person in danger of dying takes precedence. While it is not clear that Rabbi Shabsai Cohen intends to do away entirely with the category of talmid hakham, its force is surely limited by his claim that in our days the halakhic category of talmid hakham barely exists, if it does at all.41 40. Tur, chap. 251. 41. Pithei Teshuva, ad loc., cites Resp. Yad Eliyahu, resp. 43, who disagrees with the Shakh.</page><page sequence="23">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 85 A second striking shift-more accurately, set of shifts-appears in the eighteenth-century writings of Rabbi Ya'akov Emden, who discusses the issue at length in his Migdal Oz.42 With respect to the category of yihus, he makes the following revolutionary statement: A kohen takes precedence over a levi, and levi to a yisrael . . . although in truth the superiority [ma'alot] of the priesthood and leviteship have declined in these generations such that even for males we do not give precedence on these grounds, and this because they are kohanim only by presumption [hazaka]. Nevertheless, I am undecided about the matter [emphasis added]. In this passage, Rabbi Emden seriously considers dropping the entire cate- gory of yihus, which by his day had lost the valence it had while the Temple was still in existence and shortly thereafter.43 The category of capacity for mitzvot is altered by Rabbi Emden as well, in this case expanded rather than contracted. Rabbi Emden states that a normal male takes precedence over a minor, someone who is deaf, or someone who is a halakhic shoteh (idiot). Similarly, a normal male takes precedence over a male missing an arm and therefore unable to wear tefillin. The category of talmid hakham is expanded so that in choosing between "[a woman who is] modest, intelligent, a woman of valor over against an ordinary woman, certainly the woman who fears God" takes precedence.44 Of special importance is the fact that Rabbi Emden appears to add an entirely new category, which might be called the capacity to maximize life. This can be instantiated in one of two ways: either X himself has a greater likelihood of living over against Y, because, for example, Y is mortally ill, and X is not; or, X has the capacity to create other life, by reproduction, whereas Y does not, because he is either sterile or too old. Examples of the first sort, drawn from Rabbi Emden's words, include selecting a young 42. Perek "Even Bohen," pinah aleph. 43. It should be noted that Rabbi Emden's view is a minority one; almost all other treat- ments of the subject do use yihus categories. See the various responsa cited throughout this paper. Nevertheless, that such a view is entertained by as important a figure as Rabbi Emden is quite significant. His position is echoed in the responsa of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, discussed below. 44. One might suggest, of course, that this is not an instance of the talmid hakham category, but either a new category altogether or an important conceptual revision of the category that reflects not only Torah learning but piety.</page><page sequence="24">86 MOSHE SOKOL person over against an older person; an older person in good health against an older person in poor health; a sick person over against a person whose sickness places his life in danger; a sick person whose life is in danger over against a sick person who is mortally ill. Examples of the second sort include a male who can reproduce over against a sterile male; and a female who can reproduce over against a sterile male.45 Rabbi Emden's views are noteworthy not only because he introduces critically important new categories (especially that of selecting the person who is most likely to live as a result of treatment, a position which many contemporary poskim also take), and not only because of his questioning of the paramount rabbinic category of yihus. They are methodologically note- worthy as well, in that he argues largely from common sense, using the sort of considerations commonly found in lay or consequentialist discussions of allocating scarce medical resources. To conclude our discussion of the early modern period, one other change in the categories should be noted. As mentioned earlier, the category of rela- tive degree of need is expanded so as to be formulated as a general principle that the person in certain danger of losing his life takes precedence over the person whose life is not certainly endangered. Contemporary halakhic discussions of the problem introduce a consider- ation which, in at least one highly influential formulation, has the remark- able effect of making the entire elaborate prioritization scheme irrelevant in most cases of allocating scarce resources. All contemporary poskim of whom I am aware are in agreement that where the physician has already started treating one of two patients, X, then even if, by any of the prioritization standards, Y ranks higher than X, X still takes precedence, and it would be wrong to leave X and treat Y.46 The prac- tical ramifications of this pesak are significant, since in emergency room situations it is frequently-although by no means always-the case that treatment of the one patient begins before treatment of the other. The argu- 45. It has been suggested that a parallel to this last category can be found in the works of Rabbi Yehuda he-Hasid (see Dichovsky, op. cit., p. 63). It seems clear, however, that Rabbi Emden took the positions he did on the basis of reason rather than by appeal to the authority of anyone else. 46. Rabbi M. Feinstein, Igrot Moshe, Hoshen Mishpat, vol. 3 (New York, 1985), resp. 73, 74; Rabbi M. Hershler, Halakha u-Refu'ah, vol. 4 (Jerusalem, 1985), pp. 79-84; Rabbi Sh. Vosner, Responsa Shevet Levi, vol. 6 (B'nei Brak, 1986), resp. 242; Nishmat A vraham, vol. Yoreh De'ah (Jerusalem, 1986), p. 156.</page><page sequence="25">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 87 ments for this position, interestingly enough, are not so much halakhic or legal in nature as moral or philosophical. That is, precedent, either direct or indirect, is not cited. Rather, the considerations advanced are more general. In Rabbi M. Hershler's words: It appears on the basis of reason that if he began to treat the one who is only in possibly life-threatening danger. . . he should not leave him and treat a second one [who is in certainly life-threatening danger], since he has become obligated in the first one's treatment. And even though there is no evidence for this position, reason dictates it [emphasis added].47 Rabbi Moshe Feinstein similarly uses the language of moral obligation: ". .. and once he has been admitted to the emergency room, he has acquired a right to his place" (emphasis added).48 Rabbi Feinstein, probably the most influential posek to deal with the problem, carries the pesak one critical step further.49 He maintains that the first person to arrive at the hospital acquires the right of treatment, even before the treatment actually begins. The question he addresses specifically concerns two patients, A and B, seeking admission to the emergency room, which has a bed available only for one of them. A, who is mortally ill, clear- ly needs emergency room treatment, but it will only extend his life some- what. B, in the judgment of the physicians, can be cured entirely, but it is as yet unclear whether or not he needs emergency room treatment. Rabbi Feinstein decides that while if they were to arrive simultaneously B should be treated first, since he can be cured, nevertheless if A arrives first, then he should be admitted. His argument for this position is a psychological one: should A, who arrived first, discover that B, who arrived after him, has been admitted, than A might believe that his physicians despair of curing him and therefore have decided to admit B even though he arrived first. Such thoughts might in turn cause a further deterioration of his condition, there- by hastening his death. Since it is halakhically wrong to hasten anyone's death, A should be admitted first, even though he will die soon in any case. I might add here that by parity of reasoning, the same result should obtain for 47. Hershler, op. cit., p. 84. 48. Feinstein, op. cit., p. 304. 49. Ibid. Although the text is somewhat unclear, it is possible that Nishmat Avraham, cited above, takes the same position.</page><page sequence="26">88 MOSHE SOKOL any scarce resource, such as an organ required for transplantation: if A and B are both in need of a kidney, and A registers for the kidney before B, then A should receive the kidney first if his death might be hastened upon learn- ing that B was chosen before him. What then of the elaborate prioritization scheme developed in the class- ical sources? To quote Rabbi Feinstein: And even with respect to prioritizing, there are only those principles cited in the mishna in Horayot, and even with respect to these it is difficult to act upon them without very careful consideration [i'yun]. And even where it is certain that there is priority according to the law, that is relevant only where they are equal with respect to time [of arrival]; and the physician should go to whomever calls him first ... [emphasis added].50 Rabbi Feinstein urges great caution in applying the prioritization system of the rabbinic sources to real-life situations, perhaps echoing, in part, Rabbi Emden's views. It should be noted as well that he cites only the mishna in Horayot, and none of the ancillary sources explored in the previous two sec- tions of this essay. One gets the strong impression that Rabbi Feinstein feels general reluctance to apply the classical prioritization criteria.5' According to Rabbi Feinstein's view and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the views of other contemporary poskim, the prioritization schemes for allocat- ing scarce resources which grow out of the rabbinic sources are relegated to a severely circumscribed set of cases. Are the views of these poskim, then, inconsistent with the earlier tradition? Certainly not. Earlier sources just do not raise the question of what A should do if he starts swimming out into the river to save B, a yisrael, then notices that C, a kohen, is drowning in another part of the river. Or of whether the yisrael or the kohen should be redeemed first when the former was captured by the enemy before the latter. Thus, strictly speaking, there is no inconsistency. Nevertheless, the great stress contemporary poskim, and particularly Rabbi Feinstein, place on chronological priority is clearly a halakhic hiddush (innovation) of the first order, whose practical significance cannot be overstated. Can we make any general observations about the halakhah's develop- 50. Ibid., p. 312. 51. In this respect, Rabbi Feinstein may differ from such authorities as Rabbi Unterman, cited above in n. 22.</page><page sequence="27">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 89 ment on this issue from the rabbinic period on down? Taken as a whole, I would argue, the halakhah has to a certain extent moved away from its early preoccupation with yihus (note the extremely long list in Horayot) and Torah scholarship, via Rabbis Emden and Cohen in particular, to consi- derations that are more universal in nature. These include various elabora- tions on the degree-of-need category and, especially, the contemporary stress on chronological priority and time of arrival. The justification for many of these considerations, it will be remembered, is universal as well: general moral intuition. It seems clear, then, that there are identifiably moral contours to the shape of the halakhah's development on the issue in question. VI To conclude our analysis we must backtrack temporarily and consider the moral-theoretic consequences of the classical prioritization hierarchy, which emphasized yihus, Torah scholarship, and the like. We argued earlier that where the resource is divisible the halakhah, according to some of its most influential interpreters, took what appeared to be a deontological posi- tion: the owner of the water divides it into two equal parts, so that each of the travelers can live a bit longer. But how can deontological ethics, which takes with absolute seriousness respect for individual human worth, dignity, and justice, adopt as allocation criteria such considerations as yihus, for example, which is utterly foreign to its grund principles? Surely my value as a human being is not dependent upon my yihus! Isn't the entire sugya in Horayot, then, a striking counterexample to the thesis argued for earlier? More importantly-and these two questions are linked-aren't some of the classical categories morally problematic in their own right, at least by contemporary standards, apart from moral-theoretic considerations? The Yerushalmi's position, codified in the Shulhan Arukh, that providing cloth- ing for the wife of a talmid hakham takes precedence over feeding an am ha'aretz is only the most troubling of the classical considerations; it is by no means the only troubling one. Of course, this question is in its own way anachronistic, in that it projects late-twentieth-century American moral values onto ancient Near Eastern texts. It is a truism that the ancient rabbis did not think like contemporary Americans. Nevertheless, the question still needs to be addressed, in light of our discussion of methodology in the first</page><page sequence="28">90 MOSHE SOKOL section of this essay. If explaining a classical text at least in part involves justifying it, then the question raised here is a quest for justification: why would one want to take the rabbinic position? what can be said to make it inherently plausible? In light of the quest for justification, we can also ask ourselves whether the rabbis themselves may have had some deep underly- ing intuition which would shed new light on their position, and suggest an explanatory framework separate from their obvious cultural predispositions about such values as yihus. Dismissing questions such as these about classi- cal sources on grounds of anachronistic projection is just too easy, and blocks deeper inquiry into the sources. At this point in our analysis, it would be helpful to place the halakhic approaches to allocating scarce resources in the context of the general legal and philosophical approaches to the problem.52 These have fallen into two main schools: those who advocate criteria of social worth, and those who advocate an egalitarian method of allocation. The social-worth school, fol- lowing the teleological ethicists, takes into account, in deciding who shall live and who shall die, such considerations as past and future contributions to society, volunteerism, size of family, and the like. These categories cer- tainly bear a resemblance to the classical halakhic considerations of Torah scholarship, social need, and even yihus. However, the social-worth school has been widely criticized on a number of grounds, but most importantly for violating the incommensurate worth of a human being by reducing his value to mere social utility. Does the halakhah also in effect reduce human worth to social utility or genealogical rank? The egalitarian school, following the deontologists, takes as fundamen- tal uncompromising respect for human worth and dignity-the view that human beings can never be treated only as means to some socially useful end. Therefore, say the egalitarians, each patient must be treated equally. How then is the resource to be allocated? By some arbitrary means which does not rank people according to utility. This may take the form of a lot- tery, or better yet, a first-come-first-served system, similar in effect to the position taken by Rabbi Feinstein (although for somewhat different rea- 52. There is an enormous amount of literature dealing with the problem in legal and partic- ularly philosophical sources, and to cite even the most important studies here would be exces- sive. The best summary and bibliography I am aware of is in Maxwell J. Mehlman's "Rationing Expensive Lifesaving Medical Resources," Wisconsin Law Review, 1985, no. 2, pp. 239-303.</page><page sequence="29">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 91 sons). On this summary analysis, then, it would seem that the halakhah developed over the years from a largely consequentialist/social worth view in the rabbinic period, to a position akin to deontologism/egalitarianism, as at least partially embodied in the views of Rabbi Feinstein.53 This analysis, however, is seriously flawed. It must be remembered that where the resource is divisible, we argued that the halakhah takes a deonto- logical position as early as the rabbinic period, at least according to many halakhically authoritative interpretations of the rabbinic texts. It will not do, then, to distinguish between an early consequentialist period and a late deontological period if even important early sources are, from the halakhic perspective, authoritatively explained as deontological. The central question really is, why does the halakhah, according to the views we have considered here, employ largely deontological considerations when the resource is divi- sible, and employ, at least up until the modern period, largely consequen- tialist considerations when the resource is not divisible? Why shift moral- theoretic gears when shifting kinds of resources? This question leads us into the very heart of the matter. I would suggest-and herein lies the nub of my analysis-that in all cases of allocation three moral/halakhic imperatives may be postulated as explaining the halakhic decision: 1. The equal-respect principle. All human beings must be treated with equal respect for their human worth. 2. The maximize-life principle. Act always so as to extend the sum total of human life. 3. The nonarbitrariness principle. Do not make arbitrary decisions in matters of life and death. The equal-respect principle is deontological, and derives from our account of the travelers case. The maximize-life principle is teleological in formula- tion, and derives ultimately from the biblical command not to stand by while someone's life is endangered (lo ta'amod al dam re'ekha). The non- arbitrariness principle is what I propose to account for how the halakhah 53. I recognize that Rabbi Feinstein's reasoning is not deontological (although it is consis- tent with deontologism). My point is that the practical position he takes is one that would in some important respects follow from deontologism/egalitarianism.</page><page sequence="30">92 MOSHE SOKOL deals with certain conflicts between the equal-respect principle and the maximize-life principle, as occurs when the resource to be allocated is in- divisible. Let us see how this is so. Our analysis of the travelers case has shown that where the resource is divisible, the base-line principle which governs the choice situation for many poskim is deontological-the equal-respect principle. All the water is not given to just one person, as the maximize-life principle, in good teleo- logical form, would require. Rather, the claims of each traveler must be treated with absolutely equal moral seriousness. Nevertheless, life can be maximized to a certain extent, within the constraints set by the base-line prin- ciple, by giving some water to each. In that way each life is extended. The second principle is thus at least partially satisfied, and not voided of all moral impact. Finally, since giving equal amounts of water to each is surely not arbitrary, the nonarbitrariness principle is satisfied as well. All this changes, however, where the resource is not divisible. Here, the equal-respect and maximize-life principles come into tragic conflict. If human beings are to be treated with equal respect for their human worth without exception, then it would be wrong to give it to either of them, since giving it to one favors the recipient over the one abandoned to die. It should turn out, then, that neither would receive the water or medication, and both would die. Some deontologists do in fact take this extreme position. The halakhah clearly does not. In these difficult circumstances the maximize-life principle makes its claim. While the equal-respect principle carries great halakhic force, the halakhic tradition simply valued life too much to sacri- fice it entirely on the altar of justice. Sacrifice it partially, yes; we saw as much in the case of divisible resources, where the water is divided in two parts, giving each just a few more hours to live, rather than giving one a full 120 years. Where the sacrifice would be total, however, and neither would get the medication, the moral force of the maximize-life principle would be voided entirely, and this the halakhah would not tolerate. Thus the choice is forced: Only one can receive the kidney. By what criteria should one choose? The most common egalitarian/deontological answer to this question is that under these conditions the choice should be arbitrary, so that consider- ations irrelevant to basic human worth and dignity are never taken into account. If the choice is arbitrary, then no features of the recipient are picked out as causally determining the choice, and human worth is thus not reduced to any such features. Arbitrary criteria include lotteries or a first- come-first-served system.</page><page sequence="31">ALLOCATION OF SCARCE MEDICAL RESOURCES 93 This too, I would argue, is a position the halakhah, certainly in its classi- cal formulation, would not sustain. In matters as monumentally significant as life and death, it is wrong to make arbitrary choices: life is just too impor- tant to be treated arbitrarily. Hence, the nonarbitrariness principle. Given this conviction, the halakhah found itself forced to grasp at what are, in effect, morally irrelevant criteria, such as yihus. For the halakhah, these are far better than no criteria at all. It is, I would argue, only where the ha- lakhah's arm is twisted by its belief in the importance of life, and its abhor- rence of arbitrariness, that teleological considerations are taken into account. It should be added that many of these considerations are not artifi- cial inventions for present purposes. Rather, they are fully developed, gener- ally religious categories, with their own independent, anterior logic and justification. The value of Torah study and the laws governing the talmid hakham were not produced for the sake of the mishna in Horayot, nor were the categories and laws relating to yihus. These are all fully articulated else- where, and borrowed here in service of what amounts to a morally coerced choice. That the halakhah does import these considerations is not at all surpris- ing, given its endorsement of the three principles. What is surprising-even startling-is the extent to which the halakhah avoids them. Where A is a talmid hakham and B is an alcoholic misfit, and the medication they both need can be divided, then according to many influential poskim, divide it the physician must, although both will shortly die. Radical respect for human equality and justice here prevail above all else. Touro College New York, N.Y. I am grateful to Prof. Dov I. Frimer for referring me to a number of the contemporary responsa cited in this paper, and for his insightful comments on an earlier draft. Dr. Ronnie Warburg also made several valuable suggestions. Abridged versions of the paper were read before the New York Jewish Theology Group and the Association for Jewish Studies Confer- ence in Boston. The comments I received on both those occasions proved most helpful.</page></plain_text>
