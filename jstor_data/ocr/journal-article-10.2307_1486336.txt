COHEN Princeton University One of the fascinating internal Jewish disputes which the Cairo Geniza has revealed to us is the famous conflict over the Palestinian Gaonate be- tween the venerable Head of the Yeshiva, the Gaon Solomon b. Judah (in office ca. 1026-1051), and the usurper, Nathan b. Abraham.* Some two dozen documents relating to the schism have thus far been identified, edited, and interpreted, thanks to the painstaking efforts of Jacob Mann, Richard Gottheil and William H. Worrell, S. M. Stern, and S. D. Goitein, while a few more still await publication. From these precious morsels, we know that the dissension lasted four years, from September 1038 to Octo- * I would like to thank the Librarian of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America for permission to publish (with facsimile) the Elkan Nathan Adler frag- ment edited below, and the Librarian of the University Library, Cambridge, Eng- land, for permission to republish (with facsimile) the Taylor-Schechter fragment. Professor S. D. Goitein kindly discussed all aspects of this article with me and made many valuable suggestions concerning my transcription of the texts, my translations, and other substantive matters. Responsibility for the contents of the article remains my own. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 CONFLICT OVER PALESTINIAN GAONATE ber 1042; that it involved communities in Palestine (Jerusalem, Ramle), Syria (Damascus), and Egypt (Fustat); that Karaites as well as Rabbanites were drawn into the battle; that both camps solicited aid from govern- mental authorities; that the influential laity as well as the scholarly elite joined in the fracas; and that the breach was finally closed as a result of a significant "democratic" agreement, representing the consensus of the scholars of the Yeshiva and the community, represented by the "elders."' 1.

Mann, Jews, II, 145-46, but, due to a methodological oversight, not recognized by Mann as being relevant to the affair. In the letter, the Gaon Solomon b. Judah writes to Sahlin b. Abraham in Fustat, "I have only the name, but not the power, of my office" (1. 21), alluding to the settlement of 1042, which stipulated that all future decisions affecting the Yeshiva were to be rendered by a board of five. The addressee's father, Abraham, is referred to as deceased, which led Mann, quite uncharacteristically, to conclude that "our letter cannot date later than Tammuz, 1032, when we found Abraham b. Sahlin referred to as departed from this life" (ibid., I, 129). Of course, that fact establishes only the (tentative) terminus a quo, not the terminus ad quem. For the connection with the controversy of 1038-42, see Med. Soc., II, v, A, 1. n. 29 (p. 14). Professor Goitein (January 9, 1975) kindly showed me a photostat of ULC Or 1080 J 7, containing a badly effaced text in Arabic characters, which he described as follows: "At the end of a court record dated February 10, 1040, there is a draft of a petition, written after the date on the legal document, and addressed to al-mawqif al-sharif ("the Noble Place," perhaps the vizier), stating that now for several years the scholars have been in a state of</page><page sequence="3">MARK R. COHEN 3 Up to now, the rivalry itself has seemed largely personal. There are hints, however, that it had political ramifications exceeding the scope of a simple case of usurpation. For example, one of the letters published by Jacob Mann is addressed to a Nagid, that is, the territorial head of a Jewish community, whose name and location have hitherto remained a mystery. The intriguing, but unfortunately incomplete, fragment, which belongs to the vast Taylor-Schechter Collection of the University Library, Cambridge, England, suggests that the prestigious addressee himself had formerly supported Nathan's subversion.2 Among the Geniza papers belonging to the Elkan Nathan Adler Collec- tion of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, I chanced upon the other half of that document. After piecing them to- gether with the aid of photostats, I discovered that it contains not one, but two letters-actually, a complementary pair-addressed to the Nagid of Qayrawan. These missives shed dramatic new light on the early stage of the dispute, expand the geographical horizon to include distant Tunisia, and provide additional insight into the political dimension of the crisis. The newly identified fragment discloses: (1) that aside from personal an- tagonisms that may or may not have existed between the two principals, Nathan based his opposition on Solomon b. Judah's non-Palestinian pro- venience; (2) correlatively, that Nathan was a native Palestinian, and not a usurper from outside; (3) that Nathan exploited latent social antagonisms between the roughneck "young men" (shabib) and the more respectable "elders"; (4) that Nathan had the initial backing of the elders of Qay- rawan and of their Nagid; (5) that an early plan of the Fustat partisans of Solomon b. Judah to gain the ear of the government involved the Nagid of Qayrawan, the Zirid ruler of Tunisia, and the Fatimid vizier in Cairo. As a sidelight, we also learn (6) that, in the thick of the battle, there ar- rived in Egypt none other than the Babylonian Nasi, Daniel b. cAzarya, disarray about a person named Nitin b. Ibrahim, who claimed he was Head of the Yeshiva (ra's al-mathiba). The petitioners ask that their synagogue be re-opened"; cf. Med. Soc., III (in preparation), ix, C, 1, n. 195. The date of the beginning of the schism, usually given as 1039 or ca. 1039, is now fixed by Goitein, Med. Soc., II, 16, on the basis of ULC Or 1080 J 45. The conflict ended with the signing of the settlement of Hoshacna Rabba 4803 A.M. [= October 8, 1042], ed. Gottheil and Worrell, op. cit., pp. 196-201 (fragment XLIII). The editors mistakenly made this date equivalent to October 8, 1043, (ibid., pp. 196, 200, n. 33), while Jacob Mann erred in the opposite direction, and cited the document as 1041 (Mann, Texts, I, 331-32), leading others, also, to slip up.

Judah a dozen years later, would him- self assume the throne of the Palestinian Gaonate. Seen in the perspective of these new findings, "the affair of Nathan b. Abraham as rival Gaon of Palestine to Solomon b. Yehudah," to borrow Jacob Mann's cautious rubric, assumes the aspect of a complex power struggle with significant political overtones and a much more far-reaching geographical scope than formerly imagined. Before proceeding to the analysis of the letters, it will be useful, once again, to review briefly the main outline of the story, paying special atten- tion to the political character of the dispute. Sometime before the fall of 1038, Nathan (Abfi Sahl)3 b. Abraham b. Saul returned to Jerusalem, having left Palestine as early as 1011 to attend to his deceased father's estate in North Africa. During the intervening years Nathan had studied at the feet of the eminent R. IHushiel of Qayrawan and, like so many of his Jewish contemporaries, had plied the Mediter- ranean trade routes. A financial setback, described in a letter of his writ- ten to Fustat while en route from the Egyptian capital to the seaport town of Damietta (and from there, probably, to Palestine), may or may not have been a factor influencing his decision to return to Jerusalem.4 Political ambition definitely was. His uncle, the Av (President of the Court) of the Palestinian Yeshiva had recently died, and Nathan resolved to claim the prestigious office for himself. Technically, however, he was not in line for succession. According to the well-known strict rules for advancement in the Palestinian Yeshiva, promotion depended upon senior- ity (Av, "Third," "Fourth," etc.). Some influential Palestinians, anti- cipating Nathan's attempt to intrude himself into the established prece- dence, prevailed upon the Gaon Solomon b. Judah to exclude the returnee from office in the Yeshiva and to preempt his bid for his uncle's position by formally proclaiming the elevation of the incumbent "Third" (his name was Tobias b. Daniel the hiivivr). Nevertheless, Nathan arrived on the scene with powerful Egyptian backers, prominent among them a notable named Mevorakh b. Eli b. Ezra. After first winning support from one of the men who had counseled Solomon against Nathan, this Mevorakh 3.

COHEN 5 succeeded in convincing the "Third" to yield his right of succession to the newcomer. In his letter to Fustat describing these details, Solomon goes out of his way to absolve himself of responsibility for the rapid and un- expected turn of events. At the end of the letter he seems to be trying to cushion the blow by assuring his correspondent, probably the well- known scholarly communal leader Sahlin b. Abraham, that the newcomer is "better than I was led to believe." Clearly, at this early stage, there were people in Egypt, too, who were suspicious about Nathan's ultimate political intentions.5 It was not long, of course, before Nathan's secret designs became mani- fest. In September 1038, during the High Holiday festivities in Jerusalem, a schism occurred. A group of lay notables, including the influential Shu- wayc family, who were dissatisfied with Solomon's administration, pro- claimed Nathan counter-Gaon. Nathan, however, probably precipitated the coup by capitalizing on their long-standing grievances.6 Indeed, Nathan successfully employed a multiplicity of political strategies to gain and hold office. The center of gravity of Nathan's power was the important Jewish settlement in Ramle, the provincial administrative and economic capital. Ramle was the usual seat of the Av, or President of the Court of the Yeshiva---Nathan's first office.7 For a time earlier in the century, Ramle had even been the home of the Palestinian Yeshiva itself.s There was ample reason, therefore, for Nathan's selection of this city as the base for 5.

He won recognition, however, in Damascus as well,9 and even visited that community in his capacity as Gaon.'o His most im- portant outside support came, of course, from Egypt, not only from the above-mentioned traveling companions who arranged his installation as Av, but also from powerful family connections in the Fatimid capital. The published half of our document includes a bitter complaint (related in de- tail in one letter, but only alluded to in the other) about the highhanded malevolence of Nathan's in-laws in Fustat." Thanks to this network of political alliances with sympathizers near and far, Nathan was able to function quite securely for four years, presiding over court cases,'2 hosting joyous assemblies in his reception room (majlis), attended even by Karaites and Muslims,'3 issuing responsa for his faithful flock,'4 and appointing deputies in the manner of a Head of the Yeshiva.'5 Indeed, a letter from him to a disciple in Fustat, written in Tammuz (June/ July) 1039, and signed with the title "Head of the Yeshiva," gives no hint of any immediate threat to his authority.'6 A ban against him and his 9.

Judah promulgated at the very outset of the revolt, seems to have had little restraining effect upon Nathan's ambitions.7 Neither had an appeal to the government by the followers of Solomon, probably in the spring and certainly no later than the summer of 1040, about which we read in a draft of a later petition to the Caliph al-Mustan- sir. The only consequence of this appeal seems to have been an abortive diplomatic mission by the Karaite notable, David (ha-Levi) b. Isaac, dele- gated by the government to bring peace, and the closing by government order of a synagogue in Ramle, presumed to be the larger, Palestinian synagogue. The petition to al-Mustansir states that the synagogue had been shut down for more than two years.'8 During those two years, the followers of Solomon b. Judah, apparently impressed by Nathan's broadly based support and certainly mindful of the rabbinic training he had attained from the scholars of Qayrawan,'" seem to have resigned themselves to the condominium. The straw which broke the back of the proverbial camel and provoked their petition to the Caliph, which, in turn, it seems, led to the settlement of October 1042, was the 17.

Stern dated the shutdown of the synagogue "not later than the summer of 1039" (op. cit., p. 204) by working backwards from the petition, which he quite reasonably surmised had prompted government interven- tion leading to the settlement of Hoshacna Rabba 4803 A.M. Unfortunately, he mis- dated that event in 1041, rather than in 1042, evidently misled by Mann's own im- precision. Stern meant to place the closing of the synagogue, therefore, "not later than the summer of 1040." The closing of a synagogue by government order is men- tioned explicitly in a letter (apparently from Ramle) to Nathan Gaon, visiting Da- mascus, which was published, after Stern's untimely death, by Goitein; "Arabic Docu- ments on the Palestinian Gaonate," pp. 107-11. It is dated the fourth of Ramadan and written a few weeks after Passover, and it mentions that the synagogue had been closed, for a few days it seems, on the previous Purinm (p. 107, 11. 7-8). Goitein suggested three alternate dates (corresponding to 4 Ramadin)-May 30, 1039; May 19, 1040; May 8, 1041-and expressed his preference for 1039 (here Goitein, too, gave 1041 rather than 1042 as the date of the settlement). I prefer May 19, 1040, and hence Purim (March) 1040, as the time when the synagogue was first closed. This conforms with the corrected terminus ad quem (see above, this note) and, further, disposes of difficulties raised by Stern, op. cit., p. 207; n. 1. In addition, this date accords well with my proposed date of spring 1039 for the pair of letters edited and translated below. As will be shown, those letters must have been written prior to the closing of the synagogue. 19. Literary evidence of Nathan's Qayrawan training: Mann, Texts, I, 333-37; cf.

For this action, the petition dis- closes, Nathan's party had secured the backing of the influential Karaite courtier in Cairo, Fadl b. Sahl al-Tustari, that is, Abi Nasr Fadl (Heb.: Hesed) b. Sahl al-Tustari, brother and business partner of the famous "vizier" Abf Sacd al-Tustari, who was assassinated as a result of court intrigue in 1047. Interestingly, the petitioners entreated the Caliph, not to depose Nathan, but merely to restore the status quo ante and allow both Gaons to continue ruling side by side without one (Nathan) attempting to unseat the other.20 We do not yet have explicit confirmation that this petition was actually submitted, though it is reasonable to conclude with its modern editor, S. M. Stern, that something of the sort was presented to the secular authorities and that it was the resulting governmental pressure that finally forced the resolution of the conflict in October 1042. In a triumphant letter, the Gaon Solomon b. Judah writes that victory had been achieved (with God's help, of course) through the intervention of the governor and notables of the Holy City and, especially, of the governor of Ramle, all acting under orders of the Caliph and the vizier.21 By the terms of the October peace settlement, Nathan was demoted to Av, the rank he had attained peaceably, and a board of five, including both Nathan and the Gaon Solomon, was created to render all future decisions affecting the Yeshiva."2 This was both more, and less, than the petitioners had bargained for. On the one hand, Nathan lost his position; on the other, Solomon had his personal power greatly curtailed. This is apparently why he wrote, in a subsequent com- munication to Fustat: "I have only the name, but not the power of my office." 23 Moreover, strategically Nathan still remained next in line for Solomon's job. Those who expected that the old Gaon would probably not live too much longer probably considered the agreement an acceptable political compromise, which would satisfy the establishment and placate the government, until Nathan ascended legitimately, in his own 20.

In the present state of our knowledge we cannot say anything definite, though one letter, as yet unpublished, suggests that Solomon b. Judah himself wanted Daniel b. cAzarya to be his successor.25 We now come to the new Geniza find. It is a sheet of paper measuring 40.5 cm. long by 17.7 cm. wide, written on both sides, and torn off un- evenly at both top and bottom.

For a possible allusion to expectations that Solomon's death would pave the way for Nathan's advancement, see Mann, Jews, II, 165 (#63 II), 1. 7. This letter dates, it seems, from before the declaration of Nathan as Gaon in September 1038; cf. Mann, Texts, I, 327. 25. Speculation that Nathan had died: Mann, Texts, I, 333. Speculation about Daniel b. cAzarya: Goitein, "A Letter of Labrat ben Moses ben Sighmar," p. 63 (the statement that Nathan might have left Jerusalem at this time, "being himself from the West," requires modification in the light of our new document, which shows that Nathan was a native Palestinian). Unpublished Geniza letter: TS 20.19 (Professor Goitein informs me that he hopes to edit this document in the forthcoming volume 2 of Shalem), states (1. 29) that the Gaon Solomon b. Judah offered up a prayer for Daniel b. cAzarya as "designate" (mecuttid), that is, heir apparent to the Gaonate; Med. Soc., II, v, A, 1, n. 33 (p. 15). 26. This folio must not have been in the volume in Mann's time. Mann published, in whole or in part, a number of documents from ENA 3765, including folio 8; cf. Shaul Shaked, A Tentative Bibliography of Geniza Documents (Paris, 1964), pp. 196-97. The printed Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Collection of Elkan Nathan Adler (Cambridge, England, 1921), p. 44, classifies volume 3765 (along with 3763) as "Letters by Daniel ben Azariah (1054) and David b. Daniel," and Mann would hardly have missed the clear reference to Daniel in folio 10. More than likely, our document was inserted at the end of volume 3765 at some subsequent date, perhaps precisely because it mentions Daniel. Dr. Menahem Schmelzer, Libra- rian of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, whom I queried on the matter, confirmed that this hypothesis is a distinct possibility, especially since folio 10 is the last fragment in the volume. 27. From the photostats the physical meshing is not immediately apparent, since the tear actually split the layers of the paper, leaving writing on one layer, and blank spaces and residues of ink on the other (compare ENA 3765, fol. 10r, lower left corner, with TS 18 J 4, fol. 16v, upper left corner, and TS 18 J 4, fol. 16r, upper right corner with ENA 3765, fol. 10v, lower right corner).</page><page sequence="10">10 CONFLICT OVER PALESTINIAN GAONATE wise, and contentwise-with the above-mentioned Taylor-Schechter frag- ment published by Jacob Mann. That fragment is also 17.7 cm. wide, and is 38.5 cm. long. Properly joined, the writing sheet measures about 74 cm. from top to bottom.28 The Adler fragment is the top half of Mann's piece. For the reader's convenience, the published section is reprinted here, in- corporating the corrections provided by S. M. Stern,29 as well as a few more which I detected when examining a photostat of the original. The reunited document contains two letters, addressed, as we shall see, to the same Nagid. Each is in a different hand. One (A), in Hebrew, begins on verso of the Adler fragment and concludes at the bottom of recto of the Taylor-Schechter half. It is mostly in rhymed prose, including the main section dealing with the subject matter. The other letter (B), in Arabic written in Hebrew characters (Judaeo-Arabic), commences on recto of the Adler section and closes, with the signature of the sender, Shemarya b. Masliah, three-fifths of the way down verso of the Taylor- Schechter fragment. Shemarya's signature is in yet a third hand, thus indi- cating that, as was frequently the case, a scribe copied the letter for him. A Shemarya b. Masliah is mentioned in a legal document, dated 1006, pre- sumably in Fustat,30 and it is logical to conclude that a piece of outgoing correspondence such as ours, preserved in the Geniza, was written in the Egyptian capital itself. This consideration, as well as certain intrinsic signs in the Arabic letter, compels us to revise Mann's assumption that the document emanates from Palestine.31 28. By Geniza standards, this is a rather long piece of writing paper. In the vast Taylor-Schechter Collection (over 100,000 fragments), in the so-called Old Series, where fragments were, in part, sorted according to size, the largest categories, those measuring 32 inches ca. 80 cm.

COHEN 11 Both letters deal with the same matter-the usurpation of the Gaonate by Nathan b. Abraham (mentioned by name in A only)-and refer to earlier communications about the same subject. As noted, both letters com- plain about oppression from Nathan's relatives in Fustat. Indeed, these and other details dovetail so closely that Mann, who had only the bottom half, easily assumed that his fragment contained a single letter, from She- marya.32 As we shall see, the letters were, in fact, meant to form a com- plementary pair. Without the chance discovery of the missing first half it would have been very difficult to separate them.33 Letter A begins in the middle of the salutation, from which we learn that the Nagid is named b. ("son of") cAmram. Only one candidate fits this detail-Jacob b. cAmram of Qayrawan, who held the title Nagid from at least the mid-1030s through the early 1040s, and possibly as early as the 1020s and as late as the 1060s.A4 Thus Jacob Mann's revised assumption that the recipient was an as yet unknown Nagid of Egypt," as well as S. M. Stern's qualms about adopting the identification with the Qayrawan Nagid Jacob b. cAmram, wondering what influence he could have had upon the Fatimid authorities,36 are now both completely dispelled. his own locale and that entire province (Professor Goitein); (2) Shemarya com- plains about the oppressive behavior, locally, of Nathan's father-in-law and brothers- in-law (TS 18 J 4, fol. 16v, 11. 15-19 = Mann, Jews, II, 354). In a letter sent to Fustat, after he had departed from that city, Nathan inquires after the welfare of his father-in-law (Mann, Jews, II, 170 [#68], 11. 12-15); (3) Shemarya reports that Nathan's relatives applied to the Chief Qadi concerning a certain matter (TS 18 J 4, fol. 16v, 1. 16 = Mann, ibid.). The Fatimid Chief Qidi had his office in the Egyptian capital; (4) Shemarya refers to letters from Solomon b. Judah which arrived locally and were forwarded by caravan and by boat to the addressee (TS 18 J 4, fol. 16v, 11. 8-10 = Mann, ibid., and cf. below, p. 18); (5) Shemarya requests that a certain letter be sent from Qayrawan "with the pilgrim caravan" (ENA 3765, fol. O10r, 1. 36). A pilgrim caravan setting out from North Africa would pass through Cairo-Fustat on its way to the Hijiz (cf. below, n. 54). 32. Mann, Jews, II, 352; cf. Mann, Texts, I, 328. 33. The fact that one side is in Hebrew and the other in Arabic is not in itself a giveaway. Professor Goitein tells me that such switches from flowery Hebrew prose to straightforward vernacular are not unusual. The difference in handwritings, how- ever, might have triggered some suspicions. 34. H. Z.

Soc., II, 23-40.</page><page sequence="12">12 CONFLICT OVER PALESTINIAN GAONATE In the new fragment we learn what we might have guessed from Mann's published portion. The writer of the Hebrew letter (A) and his compa- triots are members of the "large synagogue," namely, the Palestinian one, and, further, they are devotees of the "Great Sanhedrin," that is, the Pales- tinian Yeshiva."7 The main subject of A, the ongoing crisis precipitated by the usurper, Nathan b. Abraham, is contained in the published half of the letter. The writer and his confreres had earlier chastised the Nagid for contributing to the insurrection by asking a certain Muslim dignitary named Abu 'l- Qlsim Ibn al-Ukhuwwa, evidently in the Egyptian capital,3s to obtain the government's intervention on Nathan's behalf. Nathan had even claimed that he had been encouraged to act by people in the Maghreb (letter B says: in Qayrawan; see below). After reading letters from Solomon Gaon, however, the Nagid had rejoined the cause of legitimacy and evi- dently also retracted his request to Ibn al-Ukhuwwa. Now the writer and his colleagues petition the Nagid to publicize his renewed support for Solomon in letters addressed to the Jewish communities, and to prevail upon the rebel himself to desist. The writer also hopes, though he does not say how, that the Nagid will use his good offices with the government (in Cairo) in the matter. As an afterthought, the writer alludes to terrible wrongs being inflicted by Nathan's relatives. This description of the unsettled state of affairs is mostly contained in the bottom portion of the letter, which Jacob Mann published. In the new fragment, the writer opens his epistle with some unrelated good news. As if sent by God to provide solace in the midst of all the trouble, a Nasi (Davidide) by the name of Daniel b. cAzarya, grandson of the Exilarch Solomon, had arrived. This person is none other than the famous schol- arly Babylonian Nasi who later succeeded Solomon b. Judah as Palestinian Gaon upon the latter's death in 1051. Our letter-writer reports that Dan- iel instituted "reforms" (taqqinot) concerning two oft-decried sources of moral laxity in the Jewish community: possession of slave girls, and in- dulgence in the kind of musical levity so popular in Muslim society. The potential for concubinage with slave girls, forbidden by Jewish law but rampant in Islam, posed a genuine threat to the harmony of Jewish house- 37. "Large synagogue"= Palestinian synagogue: Med. Soc., II, 6. 38. Stern's assumption (op. cit., p. 206, where he also corrects Mann's reading of the name) that this notable was located in Ramle is to be revised. In letter B, as restored (ENA 3765, fol. 10r, 11. 36-37 plus TS 18 J 4, fol. 16v, 11. 3-4), the writer requests that a letter be sent to Abu 'l-Q~sim "with the pilgrim caravan," i.e., bound for the Hijiz via Cairo-Fustat.</page><page sequence="13">MARK R. COHEN 13 holds wealthy enough to own them. Jewish authorities, beginning with the Babylonian Geonim, took various steps to prevent it.39 As is well known, too, the Babylonian Geonim, including the illustrious Hay b. Sherira, who died in the very year the Palestinian schism erupted (1038), took a dim view of Jewish participation in parties involving secular music, especially erotic Arabic songs, and especially when performed at intoxi- cated Muslim gatherings.40 It is not at all surprising, therefore, to find Daniel b. cAzarya, a younger contemporary of Hay Gaon of Pumbedita and a brother-in-law of cAzarya Gaon of Sura, speaking out against these social abuses in Egypt. We learn, therefore, that this prestigious and learned exilarchal descendant made his debut in the Fatimid domains at least a decade earlier than formerly assumed and, ironically, in the midst of a political crisis which vaguely adumbrated his own successful takeover of the Palestinian Gaonic office a dozen years later.41 Following the description of Daniel b. cAzarya's exploits, the last lines of the Adler fragment of A introduce the account of the Nathan b. Abra- ham imbroglio: "We have previously sent letters by the fast caravan to him (i.e., the Nagid) and to the c[ommunities] dependent upon him, ex- plaining the conduct of Mr. [Nathan b. A]braham." The missing name, Nathan, placed in brackets here, is found at the beginning of the Taylor- Schechter segment. Letter B begins in medias res, recounting the schism. Throughout, Na- than is referred to as "this person" rather than by name. The Nagid's name is not preserved, but it is clear from references to Qayrawan, in addition 39.

Abu'l-Q sim Ibn al-Ukhuwwa is mentioned explicitly: the Nagid is requested to goad him into decisive and quick action on Solomon's behalf. Shemarya b. Masliah, the writer, tells the same story as the author of A, but adds some fascinating new details. We learn, for example, that the support which Nathan claimed to have secured in the Maghreb came from none other than the elders of Qayrawan. Though Shemarya and his compatriots re- fuse to believe this, it is clear from what he says that many people, both in Egypt and in Palestine, did. In the light of what is stated openly in A about the Nagid's early backing of Nathan, it seems that Nathan had good reason to bandy about the names of Qayrawan notables as his allies. The supporters of Solomon obviously feared Nathan might be telling the truth. Else they would hardly have gone to such lengths to sway the Nagid back and to have him and the elders disavow their complicity in the re- volt. Shemarya is even more explicit about this than the author of A. He wants the Nagid to dispatch letters to "this city" (i.e., Fustat) and to Palestine, from himself and from the elders, repudiating Nathan's allega- tions, "so that people will cease believing what he has been spreading about." It is not clear why some of the Qayrawan leaders should have initially sanctioned Nathan's attempt to topple Solomon b. Judah. Aside from the likely positive motive of wishing to see one of their local graduates succeed to high academic office, it is worth noting that the Geniza con- tains echoes from about this time of dissatisfaction in Qayrawan with Solo- mon b. Judah.42 As is well known, Solomon b. Judah, the immigrant from Fez, Morocco, did not belong to one of the three native Palestinian Gaonic families, and frequently met opposition on this account.43 From the newly discovered opening section of B we learn, for the first time, that Nathan was a Pales- tinian, and that he, top, objected to Solomon on the grounds that the latter was an outsider. Nathan argued "that it is not permissible for any west- erner to serve in the Heads[hip] and that it is only permissible for a man from the Holy Land (man huwa [min] ahl al-sha'm) to sit on this throne." However, the writer of B does not associate this claim with the Qayrawan 42. Mann, Jews, I, 123-24 and n. 1 there, and p. 94, n. 1: a letter from Qayrawan dated the middle of Av (July) 1035. Cf. Hirschberg, op. cit., I, pp. 214-15. Hirsch- berg discusses (ibid., p. 215) the close working relationship between the Nagid Jacob and the elders of Qayrawan, which we see confirmed also by our own letter. 43.

Indeed, it is illogical to assume that the Maghrebis of Tunisia would have opposed Solomon of Fez merely because of his North African origin. Additional insight into Nathan's political behavior emerges from our letter as well, especially when combined with bits of information culled from other documents. Shemarya informs the Nagid that Nathan had "gathered about him a group of young men (shabab) like himself" when first expropriating Solomon's title. These "young men" appear in the Geniza (variously called bah.lrim, in Hebrew; sibyan or shubban, from the same root as shabib, in Arabic) both as an age group and as a social class, active in communal life, frequently surfacing during times of strife as allies of one or another of the conflicting parties. They resemble the "young men" (ahddith) in contemporary Muslim Syria and Northern Mesopotamia who often emerged in times of dissension as an autonomous opposition bloc to the ruling establishment. In a letter from the elders of Ramle, not connected with the affair of 1038-1042, the young men are designated pejoratively as "ignorant, uncouth youngsters from the lowest ranks of the society" (bahi.rim u-viirim u-khsilimn min qes5t ha-ciim) adapting a phrase from the Talmud (min ha-qosTm she-bi-dc-m)." In one of his letters con- demning Nathan, Solomon b. Judah uses the same language to de- scribe the young troublemakers of Ramle, Nathan's collaborators: "He gathered around him some of the lowest ranks of society (min ha-qJsyim she-bJ-cJm) and made them into great elders, feeding them food and drink, and imposing upon many the oath 'to love his friends and to hate his ene- mies.' "5 In yet another letter, describing the beginnings of the schism and the promulgation of the ban against the perpetrators, Solomon relates how in Ramle, Nathan, like Abimelech son of Gideon in the Book of Judges, "gathered about himself vain and arrogant men (an JshTm rgqTm u-fiShaztm) whom he hired with money, clothing, food, and drink." 4" Taken 44.

Nathan, therefore, emerges as an astute politi- cian, attempting to solidify his power by cultivating a multiplicity of interest groups, both in Palestine (resentful lay notables like the Shuwayc family, the Karaites,"47 the "young men") and abroad (Fustat, Damascus, Qay- rawan). Doubtless it was Nathan's solid and diversified political support that ensured his tenure for such a long time and thwarted the efforts of the establishment to unseat him. The letter of Shemarya b. Masliah (B) states (in the Taylor-Schechter portion) that Nathan's partisans even succeeded, temporarily at least, in obtaining the consent of the chief of police (sahib al-shurta) to forbid the mentioning of Solomon's name in "our synagogue" (in the capital). Moreover, Nathan's father-in-law and brothers-in-law (said earlier in the letter to have formed a "faction" [mutahazzibin, from hizb, "faction"]), tried without success to influence the Chief Qadi to take over the most important Jewish communal organs, the pious foundations and the courts. If the allegation is to be believed, this would have consti- tuted a remarkable act of treachery.48 The writer and his party thought of petitioning the Caliph but were fearful of what might devolve upon the rebel, Nathan. Perhaps this is the reason for the circuitous diplomatic strategy which the Egyptian Jews propose and which we learn about in fascinating detail in the new part of our letter. Shemarya asks the Nagid to obtain a letter from the Supreme Commander (amir al-umar~') Sharaf al-Dawla to the vizier Safiyy Amir al-Mu'minin wa-Khilisathu requesting the latter to issue an order reconfirming the legitimacy of the incumbent Head of the Yeshiva. Sharaf al-Dawla ("Nobility of the Dynasty") is the honorific title (laqab) of the Zirid ruler (amir) of Tunisia, al-Mucizz Ibn Bdis (r. 1016-1062). Since we are here in ca. 1039 and speaking of Qayrawan, where the Nagids were members of the Zirid court, it is virtually certain that al-Mucizz is meant.49 Safiyy Amir al-Mu'minin wa-Kh-ilisathu ("Sincere and Devoted 47.

COHEN 17 Friend of the Commander of the Faithful") is the laqab of the Fatimid vizier al-Jarjara'i (1027-1045), with whom al-Mucizz Ibn Badis is known from Islamic chronicles to have been in friendly correspondence.50 Our document, therefore, furnishes an additional datum for Islamic history: further evidence of the good diplomatic relations between the Zirid vassal al-Mucizz and his Fatimid overlords, particularly the vizier al-Jarjari'T, in the years immediately preceding the rupture with Cairo, which took place during the 1040s.5' The Jews in the Egyptian capital were attuned to this special relationship and devised a plan to exploit it, evidently hoping to avoid what they considered to be the more dangerous and unpredictable road of petitioning the Caliph directly. Three further questions deserve our attention: What is the relationship between the Hebrew letter (A) and the Arabic one (B); can they be dated with any precision; and what became of the letters? Regarding the relationship between the two, one can only speculate. Clearly they were intended to form a pair. That is why they were written on either side of the same sheet of paper and that is why so many of the details, as well as the main message-the request for the Nagid's interces- sion-match. Possibly they were composed simultaneously by spokesmen of different loyalist groups in Fustat in order to convey the impression of widespread consensus in the capital. Perhaps the author of the Arabic letter, Shemarya b. Maslial, wanted, simply, to make more explicit certain vague allusions incorporated into the more flowery, but less specific, rhymed-prose Hebrew epistle (the complicity of the Qayrawan notables, the malevolence of Nathan's Fustat relatives, the proposed diplomatic strategy). Regarding the date, one may venture a more specific hypothesis. Clearly, the letters reflect the early stage of the conflict. Nathan's coup is pictured as a recent event. The writers know nothing of the subsequent unsuccessful peacemaking efforts by David ha-Levi b. Isaac or of the closing of the synagogue, developments described in the petition to the Caliph al-Mus- tansir as having occurred "more than two years ago." Conversely, the negotiations with and through Qayrawan, which occupy center stage in our letters, appear to have receded into the distant background later on. They 50. Cf. below, n. 119. 51. H. R.

Certain considerations lead me to believe that our missives belong to the spring of 1039. Letter B contains a reference to two copies of a com- munication from the Head of the Yeshiva, namely, Solomon b. Judah, which had just been forwarded to the Nagid, one by caravan, and the other, "in the ships" (fi 'l-marlikib). In his discussion of the mail service in the first volume of A Mediterranean Society, Professor Goitein explains that during winter, roughly between October and March, when ships did not sail, people sent letters with commercial couriers (fuyiij), who traveled in the regular overland caravans. During summer, approximately from April through September, people entrusted their correspondence to busi- ness friends journeying "in the ships" (fi 'l-marakib), that is, by convoy. Convoys sailed in spring, usually from the end of April to the beginning of June, and in fall, normally from the middle of August to the end of September. During the summer hiatus, the commercial overland mail service again filled the gap.53 In the light of these facts, I assume that the forwarded letters alluded to in letter B were sent at a time of year coinciding with one of the transi- tions between overseas and overland mailing. A further detail makes spring the most likely possibility. Letter B requests that the Nagid return a mes- sage to Abu 'l-Qisim Ibn al-Ukhuwwa "with the pilgrim caravan" (qifilat al-hajj). In 1039 the pilgrim caravan would have departed from Qayrawan in the spring in order to reach the IHijiz by the beginning of Dhu 'I-Hijja, the pilgrimage month, which commenced that year on August 24.54 Probably the writer specified the pilgrim caravan, rather than one of the faster seagoing convoys, because the pilgrim caravan was normally immune from highway attack, and hence mail sent with it was particularly safe. Professor Roy Mottahedeh notes that from sources pertaining to the 52. The reference to Qayrawan and to the Nagid R. Jacob in one of Solomon b. Judah's letters to Fustat mentioning "the rebel" (ha-qosher)- has no apparent con- nection with the events detailed in our letters; Mann, Jews, II, 163, 11. 26-30; cf. ibid., I, 144. 53. Med.

COHEN 19 eastern Islamic lands he has collected a number of references characterizing the pilgrim caravan as the safest caravan for transmitting valuables (fourth century A.H./tenth century C.E.).55 Finally, the spring date conforms well with yet another detail. Both letters (A and B) mention prior corre- spondence between Fustat and Qayrawan sent overland. This would per- tain to the winter season, just coming to a close, when the ships did not sail. It is, of course, possible that our document belongs to the spring of 1040 (Dhu 'l-I.ijja 1040 began on August 13). The date 1039 is to be preferred, however, because it is earlier in the schism, and because the letters say nothing about the vicissitudes which led up to the closing of the synagogue in Ramle. In spring 1039, Nathan's revolt was still in its shaky infancy. The Fustat loyalists could hope for the restoration of unitary rule. A year or so later, Nathan's political base had grown strong. David ha-Levi b. Isaac's mission had collapsed in failure. The synagogue had been shut down. The insurrection seemed, at least for the time being, irreversible. Finally, we may speculate on what became of the letters. The docu- ment is evidently a draft, since it was relegated to the Fustat Geniza. In- deed, there are a number of corrections in the margin and above the line in A. We may presume, therefore, that a clean copy was sent to Qay- rawan. Only one (slight) reservation about calling the letters drafts de- rives from the presence of Shemarya b. Masliah's signature at the end of B, which suggests that the text was a final, and not a practice, copy. Several explanations are possible: (1) the writer of B considered his version ready for mailing, but the writer of A insisted upon a clean copy; (2) the senders decided at the last moment not to dispatch their petition to the Nagid, having come into possession of some new information which ren- dered their request either unwise or unnecessary; (3) the paper was acci- dentally ripped and had to be replaced by a completely new copy; (4) the signature is not a signature in the usual sense, but merely the writer's way of placing his stamp of approval on the scribe's draft and instructing him to proceed to the final copy.56 One may hope that there will yet appear new documents pertaining to the schism of 1038-1042 which will resolve this difficulty and, at the same time, disclose what action, if any, resulted from the intriguing plan to apply to the vizier via Qayrawan.5' 55. Oral communication, January 23, 1975. 56. The fourth hypothesis is Professor Goitein's, who informs me that this was often the practice. 57. It is obvious, however, that the desired rescript confirming Solomon b. Judah in office was not obtained. Had it been, the petitioners to the Caliph al-Mustansir in 1042 would certainly have invoked it as a rationale for Fatimid action.</page><page sequence="20">20 CONFLICT OVER PALESTINIAN GAONATE The schism of 1038-1042 shows Jewish communal life under Islam in the High Middle Ages in all its multifaceted complexity.

In the background, the ever-present hand of the Jewish laity, including that of the wealthy Karaite courtiers, looms large, while social friction between age groups plays a smaller, yet n'ot insignificant, role in the action. Finally, the inter- play with Muslim government runs the entire gamut: the local police, a Muslim judge, the provincial governor, the amir of Tunisia, and, ultimately, the Caliph himself. Specifically, the sources at our disposal, especially the letters published here, point to certain trends in the politics of Jewish self-government dur- ing the first half of the eleventh century. On the one hand, despite consid- erable dissatisfaction with the administration of Solomon b. Judah and over the fact that he was an outsider lacking Gaonic pedigree, there was a predilection for maintaining the status quo for the sake of Jewish unity. In their petition to the Qayrawan Nagid, the Egyptian loyalists stress that Solomon is pious and has done no injury to anyone. This, in itself, seems to have constituted sufficient justification for allowing the aging Gaon to serve out his term of office in peace. On the other hand, the same de- fenders of the status quo betray a yearning for change, for the vitality of youth, and, in particular, for the reflected glory of aristocratic lineage com- bined with great learning. This sentiment is expressed by the enthusiasm they display over Daniel b. cAzarya, whose arrival in the midst of the strife they interpret as Divine consolation. Playing the part of unwitting prophets, the upholders of legitimacy may secretly have hoped that this young Babylonian scholar of royal blood would someday succeed, or even replace, Solomon b. Judah in the Gaonic office. Solomon's own eventual recognition of Daniel b. cAzarya, mentioned above, certainly vindicated these mildly subversive wishes. e * * * * * *</page><page sequence="21">MARK R.

Text: seli. The writer, here (and possibly also in line 10, below), apparently understands this enigmatic term from the Book of Psalms to mean "forever," synony- mous with nesah., in the same way that some ancient versions and some medieval commentators did; cf. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. "Psalms, Book of," cols. 1321-22. For instance, the Targum on Psalms regularly translates both sela and nesah, by le-calemin ("forever"). Ibn Ezra, on Psalm 3:3 (first occurrence of selad in Psalms), notes that "many interpret selh to mean lii-nesah," an explanation, however, which he goes on to reject. Cf. also Babylonian Talmud, Erubin 54a. Professor Goitein points out to me that the combination of selii with nesalh in the expression nesah. sela, often found at the end of Geniza letters (e.g., Mann, Jews, II, 108, 1. 3 from top; 109, 1. 26), testifies to this usage. Cf. also TS 18 J 4, fol. 5r, 1. 14, (re)ed. S. Abramson, Ba-Merkazim uva-Tefusot bi-Tequfat ha-Geonim (Jerusalem, 1965), p. 176. 67. The Palestinian Yeshiva. 68. Nathan b. Abraham. 69. Cf.

The Zirid governors of North Africa under Fatimid vassalage were called amir; Idris, ZTrlides, II, 509. 118. Sharaf al-Dawla ("Nobility of the Dynasty") was the honorific title (laqab) bestowed upon the Zirid amir al-Mucizz b. Bidis (1016-62) by the Fatimid Caliph al-Hikim (996-1021) in May 1017; ibid., I, 149. This title was lengthened, by the addition of a second epithet, to Sharaf al-Dawla wa-cAdudlhi ("Nobility and Support of the Dynasty"), by al-H.kimn's son and successor, al-Zlhir (1021-36), in 414 A.H./1023-24; ibid., p. 150. In our letter (ca. 1039), al-Mucizz is referred to by his primary title, which is followed by another attribute, T~j al-Milla ("Crown of the Community"), chosen, Professor Goitein suggests to me, in order to meet the require- ments of rhymed-prose epistolary style. Compound titles, formed with the word taij ("crown") were common in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; cf. Ibn Muyassar, Akhbir Misr (Annales d'Egypte), ed. Henri Mass6 (Cairo, 1919), p. 105 (index, s.v. titj [six examples, all from the eleventh and twelfth centuries]); Ibn al-Athir, al- Kdmil fi 'l-ta'rTkh, ed. C. J. Tornberg, vol. 13 (index volume) (Leiden, 1874), pp. 190-91, s.v. trij (more than a dozen examples, nearly all of them from the eleventh and twelfth centuries). 119. This was the honorific title of the Fatimid vizier al-Jarjari'i (in office: 1027 until his death in March 1045); Ibn al-Sayrafi, al-lshara ila man nala al-wizara, ed. Abdullah Mukhlis, Bulletin de l'lnstitut Frangais d'Archdologie Orientale (Cairo), 25 (1924-25), 77-78; Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2d ed., s.v. "al-Djardjari'i." Al-Mucizz b. Bidis is known from Islamic sources to have been in correspondence with this vizier; Idris, Zirides, I, 173. 120. Rayyis, meaning "head," is used liberally in the Geniza when referring to men of stature: Gaons, judges, Nagids, Nasis, physicians, etc.</page><page sequence="33">MARK R.

Furthermore, they suggested to him that all court cases between Jews be put under his control, and that no Jew be allowed to have jurisdiction 19. over them.135 However, they were unsuccessful in this attempt.
