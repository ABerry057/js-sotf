<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DRAMA OF NARRATION: Y. H. BRENNER'S IN WINTER by JEFFREY FLECK In her book, Transparent Minds, Dorrit Cohn reminds us that one of the special powers of fiction lies in its ability to reveal the normally hidden inner life of people other than ourselves.' Writers of fiction can, if it fits their pur- poses, place before our scrutiny the most intimate and private thoughts, feel- ings, motives, fears, and passions of their imagined characters, and can do so with a variety of techniques which, especially in twentieth-century fic- tion, take account of the complex, overdetermined, and largely unconscious processes of the human psyche. In modern Hebrew literature, no novelist has exploited this aspect of fiction with more passion and technical inven- tiveness than Y. H. Brenner. From the very outset of his career, Brenner's ability to make transparent the minds of his characters drew special atten- tion and praise. Responding to his first collection of short stories, M. Y. Berdyczewski, for example, marveled that Brenner's characters had only to speak and they "stand before us naked, revealing all that is within."2 And 1.

In the "Statement of Pur- pose" that appeared in the first issue of HaShiloah, Ahad Ha-Am had called for a literature that would present "faithful pictures of our situation ... awakening thought and broadening national consciousness."4 The younger writers, on the other hand, set their sights not upon Jewish society as a whole, but upon the Jewish individual and, in particular, on the intensely personal inner conflicts of that individual. Indeed, critics who attacked Brenner and the "younger generation" (including Bialik himself) focused their attacks precisely upon the individuals these writers portrayed. How, they asked, could dwelling upon the inner life of a few "miserable adoles- cents" on the margin of Jewish society contribute to the social mission of Hebrew literature as laid out by Ahad Ha-Am?S Shelomo Zemah, chief among Brenner's accusers, blamed him for a "lack of imagination and an inability to see anything but the ugly." Brenner's characters, Zemah com- plained, were fashioned from "worn-out, rotten material," and even then Brenner could only see the "evil that is within them."6 The critics who came to Brenner's defense met his accusers on their own ground. Thus, writing enthusiastically of In Winter in the Russian-Jewish press, H. Y. Katzenelson argued that Brenner's protagonists, far from being mere malcontents or the projections of a sick mind, were the "genuine repre- sentatives of the new generation." Borrowing his terms from contemporary Russian literary criticism, Katzenelson described the collective fate of these individuals in language that was to become standard in defining this new "national type." Having broken their ties with traditional Jewish society, he wrote, Brenner's protagonists had become "superfluous, broken men, 3. H. N.

They were, he wrote, "the vic- tims of an age of transition."8 The talush ("uprooted man"), as Brenner's protagonists came to be called, was, Shimon Halkin would later say, a "sign for the generations" of the "general uprooting" that had taken place in Jewish life in the twentieth century.9 Brenner's detractors and admirers did agree, however, on one thing, namely, what they considered his "slovenly" style, though they differed in explaining its significance. For some, Brenner's apparent lack of control over conventional narrative form and his disregard for stylistic consistency were weaknesses which the young writer should correct. For others, these "flaws" were a logical and necessary consequence of Brenner's choice of subject matter, as though the evocation of a "living soul" were somehow incompatible with considerations of artistic form, composition, and style.' Bialik's characterization of Brenner as a writer of "excellent stories with such a slovenly style"" set the tone for most Hebrew literary criticism devoted to Brenner's works well into the 1950s. Sympathetic critics sought to locate this elusive excellence in Brenner's subject matter or in his intensely personal tone. Problems of narrative form and style were either ignored or excused in deference to the "authentic" and, in the eyes of some, "proph- etic" nature of his enterprise.'2 Bialik's notion that Brenner wrote excellent stories in spite of his inatten- tion to matters of narrative style and composition is, of course, no longer taken very seriously by contemporary Hebrew critics. In recent years ample analytical, textual, and biographical evidence has been presented to suggest that Brenner was not the careless and uncritical stylist he sometimes liked to appear. Dan Miron, for example, has argued convincingly that Brenner's 7. H. Y. Katzenelson, "Sihot al davar hasifruit," reprinted in Bakon, YosefHaim Brenner, p. 54. 8.

Far from being extraneous ele- ments which one must either ignore or excuse, Brenner's stylistic idiosyncra- sies and narrative strategies are now seen as the very source of his excellence as an artist. Yosef Even's 1977 study of Brenner's literary oeuvre is entitled, pointedly, Y. H. Brenner's Narrative Craft.16 Clearly, if Brenner did indeed write excellent stories, if, as I have suggest- ed, he succeeded in rendering the minds of his protagonists more transpar- ent than had any Hebrew novelist before him, he accomplished this by means of - not in spite of - the stylistic techniques and narrative strategies he devoted to the task. But before we examine those techniques and strate- gies in Brenner's first novella, In Winter, a few words should be said about "psychological fiction," a term which is often rather loosely associated with Brenner and his work. Psychological fiction is indeed as overdetermined a term as any in use in the current critical lexicon. If it is used to describe fic- tion in which action is regarded as an expression or symptom of the person- ality of the actor, as does Tzvetan Todorov,'7 then it might arguably be applied to nearly the entire corpus of the novel, from Madame de La Fayette and Richardson to the present. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, the representation of personality in fiction, particularly in the works of experimenters like Woolf, Joyce, and Proust, underwent a kind of epistemological revolution which permits us to speak of a particularly 13.

In such fiction, the fictional world is no longer viewed as an independent and objective reality in which various characters, of varying degrees of individuality, pursue their fates. Rather, the fictional world is typically revealed to the reader only as it impinges upon the consciousness of the character; what we "see" is the imprint of experience upon consciousness, seldom experience itself. Thus, the true object of representation in the modern psychological novel is, to use Leon Edel's phrase (borrowed from Henry James), the "atmosphere of the mind," the act of perception itself and the manner in which it is complicated by the processes of the mind.'8 Brenner described much the same thing when he wrote, in response to criticism of his novel From Here and There, that it was not his intention to show "how things appear to an objective, clear-headed observer," but rather to evoke an "atmosphere" as it is perceived by a parti- cular individual.'9 In Brenner's novels, and in the modern psychological novel in general, the consciousness of the protagonist is the medium, as it were, in which all else is suspended, and as such, it constitutes the center of narrative interest. In Winter is the fictional autobiography of Jeremiah Feuermann, a young Jewish intellectual in Russia at the turn of the century. Raised and educated in the established modes of traditional Jewish society, he suffers a religious crisis at an early age and, having lost his faith, attempts to find a place for himself among the conflicting value-systems and ideologies of the modern world. He is hampered in these efforts, however, by his inability to break his psychological ties to his past, and particularly to his father, who is an object of both hatred and guilt, and by his own deep-seated feelings of inferiority, which burst out, at times, in bitter expressions of self-hatred. Feuermann, then, is caught between two worlds, neither of which can offer him a home. This situation, reflected externally in his restless travels between his hometown and the city N., leads eventually to psychological and spiritual paralysis, an internal season of "Winter." Neither the autobiographical form of In Winter nor the first-person mode in which it is narrated, however, make Brenner's novella an example 18.

Indeed, modern psychological novelists have generally preferred omniscient third- person narrators in order to avoid the restrictions imposed by a fixed and limited point of view as well as the loss of immediacy in the presentation of the "atmosphere of the mind" that results from the inevitably retrospective nature of first-person narrative. Brenner himself employed third-person narrative in other works, most notably in his last and best novel, Breakdown and Bereavement. What makes the first-person autobiographical narrative of In Winter an example of psychological fiction is the manner in which Brenner exploits the "logic" of first-person narrative, turning its apparent disadvantages into the very substance of the psychological drama. The appearance of the pronoun "I" in a narrative calls to the reader's attention a matter which, in third-person narratives, is generally forgotten, or, by convention, considered irrelevant, namely, the narrative act itself or, as Gerard Genette calls it, "the narrating instance."20 Who is this "I" and why is he writing this story? Where and under what circumstances did he write it, and how much time has elapsed since the events he is recounting took place? Now while first-person narrative may provoke these questions, it does not have to provide answers for them. It may, in fact, ignore them entirely. In S. Y. Abramovitsh's The Beggars' Book, for example, the cir- cumstances in which Mendele writes his tale are never alluded to. Indeed, while Mendele clearly recounts his adventures and encounters on the road after they have taken place, it often appears as if the action and the writing take place simultaneously.21 In In Winter, on the other hand, the narrating instance is clearly and insistently foregrounded. As a result, the reader's interest is split between the narrated events, on the one hand, and the narra- tor's attitude toward those events and, indeed, toward his own narrative activity, on the other. Gershon Shaked and Yosef Even, two critics who have made important contributions to the analysis of Brenner's narrative art, have recognized the importance of the narrating instance in In Winter.22 Drawing upon Bertril Romberg's study of first-person narrative,23 they emphasize two aspects of 20.

BRENNER'S IN WINTER 85 its "logic" that are crucial to any analysis of the novella. In drawing atten- tion to the narrating instance, first-person narrative also draws attention to the temporal distance between the events that are described in the narrative and the act of narrating itself. Thus, one must distinguish between the "nar- rated time" and the "time of narration" and take this distinction into con- sideration when analyzing the narrator's attitude toward the events he nar- rates as well as the manner in which he narrates them. In autobiographical first-person narrative, this distinction is particularly crucial, for temporal distance almost inevitably leads to psychological distance. Thus, the classic confrontation in autobiographical narrative is between the mature, know- ledgeable, and dispassionate "narrating I" and the more naive and foolish "experiencing I."24 Applying these distinctions to In Winter, Shaked and Even trace the variety of attitudes that Jeremiah Feuermann, as narrating I, displays toward his earlier avatars, the experiencing I. For Shaked, that atti- tude is essentially ironic and judgmental - the narrating I brings the experi- encing I before the "throne of judgment" - although Shaked notes a relax- ing of the irony toward the end of the narrative. In Even's analysis, Feuer- mann's attitude swings between the poles of total identification with his earlier self (the "near view") and total ironic rejection (the "distant view"). In both analyses, the emphasis falls upon Feuermann's ability to distance himself from his past and regard his earlier selves with the liberating irony that is only available to an "older but wiser" narrating I. In Winter, however, does not entirely conform to Romberg's schema, and it is, I would suggest, precisely the novella's deviations from classic autobiographical narrative that account for much of its power. Feuermann clearly lacks the intellectual and emotional distance from his past which, in classic autobiographical narrative, enables the retrospective narrator to structure his past into a meaningful and coherent whole and to maintain a consistently ironic stance toward his earlier selves. On the contrary, the past for Feuermann is still laden with highly charged emotions, still, as he sits down to write his "notes and sketches," a painful and rather mysterious burden. The very relationship between his past and present circumstances - whether he is a product of his "wretched" past or his past is simply a reflec- tion of his own innate deficiencies - is a matter of some confusion to Feuer- mann. 24. "The tone of autobiography tends to be ironic or comic, because it usually represents experience gazing backward at the innocent illusions of the child that fathered the man and because it reflects the individual's ability to rise above circumstances, if only through retrospec-</page><page sequence="8">86 JEFFREY FLECK Yes, my past is gloomy, wretched, and vulgar because it is mine, the past of a man like me; and yet, to a great degree, I am what I am because I have a past like that, a past of littleness, a gloomy, wretched, and vulgar past.25 Rather than a retrospective summing up, Feuermann's narrative enterprise is an act of introspection, an obsessive exercise in self-analysis and accusa- tion. The model that Genette proposes for this type of "testimonial" narra- tive is Rousseau's Confessions: "In writing this," Rousseau states at one point, "I feel my pulse quicken yet."26 It is this quickening of the pulse that takes place in the narrating instance that forms the central drama of In Winter, a drama composed not of narrated events but of the act of narration itself. The nature of this drama is laid out for us in the first paragraphs of the novella. Here, Feuermann not only announces his intention to write some "notes and sketches" on his life, he expresses in no uncertain terms his atti- tude toward both his past and his efforts to write about it. "My past," Feuermann asserts, "is not the past of a hero because, quite simply, I myself am not a hero" (p. 7). Feuermann is both repelled and fascinated by his past, or, as he sees it, his lack of a "heroic" past. He cannot free himself from that past, nor from the need he feels to write about it, but at the same time he must drain it of all significance, find in it only further justification for his cynicism and self-hatred. Thus, each time he asserts the possibility of narrating his past, even in the form of "notes and sketches," he immediately, impulsively retracts the assertion and retreats into an attitude of disillusion- ment and self-denigration. The very term "my life" must, for Feuermann, be surrounded by quotation marks, hemmed in with reservations, explana- tions, objections. Still, even though he knows that his story has no hope of "thrilling" the public, he must write it. "My past," he concludes, "the past of a nonhero, I write for myself and in secret" (p. 7). This syndrome of attraction and repulsion which, as Dan Miron has pointed out, is reflected in the very syntax of this opening statement,27 forms the basis of the drama of narration that follows. Feuermann will indeed evoke moments and scenes from his past, but they will not form a coherent tive analysis."

BRENNER'S IN WINTER 87 or complete autobiographical narrative. Rather, they will remain isolated and fragmentary memories rocked by varying degrees and combinations of attraction and repulsion. At times the narrative is full of empathy and pity toward the child who is victimized and persecuted by his father, his school- mates in the cheder, later by the head of the yeshiva, and still later by the gentiles and assimilated Jews of the city N., where he attempts to learn of the world beyond the confines of Jewish tradition. At other times, Feuermann's narrative seethes with self-hatred and loathing toward what he considers his weaknesses and inadequacies, his inability to gain the knowledge of the world he so desires, his obsessions with self-analysis and doubt, and espe- cially his ambivalent and confused feelings toward women. When Feuermann sits down to write his notes and sketches, few if any of the conflicts that plagued him in the past have been resolved. Thus, far from the object of retrospective evocation and analysis, these conflicts are very much a part of the narrating instance. At one point, Feuermann denies the very notion of a past that exists beyond the present moment of recollec- tion. The shape of my past is completely hidden from the eye of my memory [.. .] and the isolated facts that have escaped the upheaval, of which I know more than I remember [...] do not combine into flesh and blood to form a whole body [. . .] (pp. 9-10) Feuermann "knows" rather than "remembers" the isolated facts of his past: chronologically of the past, psychologically they belong to the present. As a result, Feuermann cannot distance himself from the events and inner conflicts that form the object of his narrative, cannot consistently maintain the perspective of an "older but wiser" autobiographer who can separate himself from his past selves through a liberating irony. The manner in which the narrating instance (and the unresolved con- flicts it contains) impinges upon the narrative of past events can be seen most clearly in Feuermann's efforts to describe his relations with women. In the course of his narrative, Feuermann returns to this subject repeatedly, and every time he does the traces of the narrating instance are unmistakable. The very first time the subject comes up we see with what difficulty and hesi- tation he approaches the still sensitive issue. Feuermann is recalling his studies at the home of Reb Hanan-Natan and the three daughters of the rabbi's boarder, who occupied the thoughts of the older students "more than Reb Hanan-Natan's Seder Nashim."</page><page sequence="10">88 JEFFREY FLECK [...] and in Obadiah's heart, the son of the rabbi himself, there was "sym- pathy" - I have already forgotten toward whom ... it seems to me... no, also toward the youngest one. She was a full-bodied girl, with cherry lips, a high bosom, and a mouth that was always ringing with laughter. But that's not relevant here. What I meant to do was only to note that I, who was quite dis- tanced from these matters, was ashamed of them from the bottom of my heart. (p. 14) (Unbracketed ellipses are Brenner's.) Feuermann's forgetting and then remembering which of the three sisters was the object of Obadiah's "sympathy" is, of course, an action that takes place in the narrating instance. It is as if we are reading an unedited first draft in which we can see not only the results of Feuermann's struggle to tell his story but the struggle itself. Even after the initial effort to remember meets with success, moreover, the struggle continues. For Feuermann's vivid memories of the youngest daughter, memories that focus upon her sen- suality and vitality, catch him by surprise, as it were, and he feels called upon not only to interrupt and dismiss the description ("But that's not rele- vant here"), but to attempt to explain and even justify this "digression" from his real narrative intentions. Feuermann's claim that he was in fact "quite distanced from these matters," however, is hardly convincing. The struggle reflected in this first attempt to raise the issue of Eros in his narra- tive offers far more convincing evidence to the contrary. In the pages that follow Feuermann expends a great deal of energy and words trying to explain the sources of his confused and contradictory feel- ings toward women. The distance and shame he feels in their presence are, he admits, "the extreme opposite of coldness and purity." In fact, he is obsessed and tormented by his desires, on the one hand, and his feelings of inadequacy and guilt, on the other. Ugly, clumsy, and uncouth by his own estimation, he is sure that he is simply a "burden to the daughters of Eve," an object of scorn and laughter. Yet his feelings of physical inadequacy in no way diminish his desires, which, in his eyes, are made no less sinful by the fact that he cannot fulfill them. "How shall I lift my head before my Creator? Is this fitting for a fighter of the kelipot?" Even after he leaves the world of the belt midrash for "the air of the world," desire and guilt still dominate his relations with women. Either they are the object of his all- consuming need to love and be loved, "even if I will only suffer from such a love," or they are useless creatures that are unworthy of him. In such a state of mind I knew several young women: Nerman, Lerner, and her ... Rachel Mohisevnah ... But enough. Here art is needed - something</page><page sequence="11">Y. H. BRENNER'S IN WINTER 89 which the last pages testify I have little of. I have filled a page with words and words - and I have said nothing. Indeed, my very effort to explain every- thing is stupid. As much as I add nuance to nuance - still, that essential, secret hidden thing will remain locked deep inside of me. (pp. 15-16) After having filled a page (in fact many pages) with "words and words," Feuermann comes to the conclusion that, in fact, he has explained nothing. At first, he attributes this to his artistic limitations, as if the difficulty were simply a matter of finding the proper mode of expression. But he immediate- ly realizes that the very effort to "explain everything" is doomed to failure. The hidden essence which he is struggling to express remains hidden precise- ly because it is still "deep inside," still a controlling obsession of his present struggle. It must remain hidden and unexplained (although Feuermann will fill more pages with "words and words" on the subject) also because the very words that Feuermann must use are bound to give a false prestige to what, in his view, are feelings deserving only scorn. Here is Feuermann, seven chapters later, still struggling to sort out his feelings toward Rachel Mohisevnah: And my feelings of attraction to that same young woman ... No, no! What love? Why do people use that noble and precious word at all for that feeling which a man feels for some young woman, even if that feeling of attraction is powerful, creative, complex, and not simply naked, overpowering lust? And thus ... but no ... I return to the subject of Haimovitz. (p. 30) Having rejected but not entirely freed himself from his religiously inspired guilt toward sex, Feuermann cannot allow himself to use the "noble and precious word" to describe what he can only view as his lust. Indeed, the residue of his religious struggles is so powerful that even the attraction of a "normal" man toward a woman does not deserve the name love. Thus, even before writing the word, in the space of time that it takes to put pen to paper, as it were, Feuermann recoils from his original impulse to use it. What we read, which takes the form of a complaint about the haphazard way in which people use the word, is the outcome of a struggle taking place in the narrating instance. Feuermann's attempt to evoke a struggle that took place in the "narrated time" only serves to produce one in the "time of nar- ration." Feuermann describes his erotic conflicts with difficulty and hesitation, with self-denigration and condemnation, because the issue is still sensitive,</page><page sequence="12">90 JEFFREY FLECK the crisis still unresolved. It is, quite simply, extremely painful for him to recall events and feelings from which he has not yet recovered, far more painful, he insists, than "picking in a wound" (p. 41). The pain is so great, in fact, that Feuermann must defend himself by denying any autobiographical significance to his frustrated longings, even as he returns to them again and again. Here was, it is true, a common occurrence, but a passing one that does not add anything to an understanding of my essential being, a meaningless occurrence. (p. 41) Just as the life that Feuermann sets out to narrate is only a life in quotation marks which, nevertheless, he feels he must record, so his erotic conflicts, which play such a central role in that life, are finally dismissed as meaning- less. Feuermann's obsessive efforts to analyze his erotic difficulties, of course, belie this particular retraction. His feelings of shame and sexual inadequacy are clearly central elements of his present attitude toward himself and, as such, are a major factor in his inability to write of his past from the comfor- table distance of retrospective irony. Indeed, when Feuermann attempts to narrate his encounters with women, the temporal distance between event and narration of event tends to collapse, creating a temporal ambiguity in- dicative of the unresolved state of the conflict. Consider, for example, the following passage in which Feuermann recalls his feelings after his first encounter with Rachel Mohisevnah in the presence of Borsif, whom he con- siders his sexual rival: When I left, there was only deep hatred in my heart toward Borsif, hatred toward his forelock, his laughter, his vest, the buttons on his coat - a hatred the like of which I had never known to that day. Clearly, that hatred was caused by my envy, envy toward the free and sublime gestures of that man ... by way of comparison, I recalled my own unbecoming, unnatural laughter, my slow negligent gestures, my stuttering words - and it all seemed so loathsome to me, so stupid and base ... and she noticed it - of course she noticed... Who? A provincial heroine? - No, I am truly stupid and base! Why do I use such a "banal" term? What wrong did I find in her? A girl like all the girls! And yet ... what is there between us anyway? (pp. 41-42) As is characteristic of Brenner's prose, the narration of a past event slides into what Dorrit Cohn calls "self-narrated monologue," the equivalent of</page><page sequence="13">Y. H. BRENNER'S IN WINTER 91 "narrated monologue" or le style indirect libre in third-person narrative.28 When evoking thoughts or feelings of an earlier time, Feuermann renders the movements of his mind as if they were happening in the present, rather than offering a retrospective summary or analysis. In general, these passages are more or less clearly framed by obviously retrospective passages, and thus the reader has little difficulty in transforming the grammatical present tense into the narrative past tense. What is especially interesting about this passage, however, is what happens within the self-narrated monologue itself in regard to time. The passage begins, conventionally enough, with a past tense and clearly retrospective notation of the moment in question. From this retrospective vantage, Feuermann can point out both the unprecedented intensity of his hatred and its source. When Feuermann begins to evoke his unspoken thoughts in self-narrated monologue, however, we are faced with some dif- ficulties. The past-tense verb that introduces the monologue ("I remem- bered ...") is followed by two verbs ("It all seemed ... she noticed ...") whose temporal status is ambiguous. Does the verb "it seemed" express the narrating I's recollection of his earlier feelings or the experiencing I's recol- lection of his feelings while in the presence of Rachel and Borsif? Is the con- clusion that "she noticed" drawn by Feuermann only now, as he recalls and narrates the past event, or was it drawn by Feuermann at the time of which he writes? The present-tense verbs that follow ("I am ... stupid... Why do I use ... ?") only add to the confusion. Is Feuermann quoting, as it were, the thoughts that ran through his mind at that particular moment out of the past, or is he calling himself stupid and questioning his use of a "banal" term now, in the narrating instance, and thus making a statement about his narrative? What, finally, are we to make of the juxtaposition of tenses at the end of the passage ("What wrong did I find in her? ... What is there between us anyway?")? Are we dealing here with past or present emotions? Is the very style of the passage, with its fragmented syntax, its ellipses, dashes, question marks, and exclamation points, a rendering of earlier emotional conflicts, or an indication of difficulties in the narrating instance? The temporal confusion of the passage, whether it is a result of conscious artistic choice or simply intuition, is certainly no flaw. It is, in fact, what gives the passage its particular power and intensity. Temporal distinctions collapse, past and present overlap, merge, and finally become indistinguish- able because the erotic conflict at the heart of the matter has not been 28.

Feuermann cannot evoke this moment from his past from a com- fortable retrospective distance because it is not simply a memory but, as he would put it, a "fact" of the present from which he can never escape. Feuermann cannot relegate his memories to the comfortable otherness of the past. But why does he feel compelled to commit those memories to writing? What is the source of the obsession that forces him to record a past that can only cause him pain and from which, in any case, he denies all signi- ficance? Toward the end of the narrative, Feuermann attempts to answer these questions: "I write," he says, "only because it is impossible for me not to cry out in despair, because I shall never stop lamenting the old pain ... yes, never ... until my last moment .. ." (p. 57). But what is to be gained from such a cry of despair? The condensed symbolism of a recurring night- mare that plagues Feuermann during his final stay in his hometown, a night- mare in which "childhood dreams were intermingled with my latest impressions," provides some clues. I am in a filthy sack. A pile of sand covers my head, and heavy stones hold down my hands and legs. I burst out of the sack - my father strikes me from above. I am a fly playing upon the cheek of that same young woman ... She grabs my wings and tears them off... The pain is similar to that which I used to feel in my childhood, when I would see Hell in my dreams . .. seven circles of ice . . . step after step ... I am climbing . . . descending ... everyone laments for me. (p. 56) Feuermann's childhood, with its emotional burden of helplessness and claustrophobic entrapment, is evoked in the image of the filthy sack, while the father, who, as Dov Sadan has pointed out, constitutes one of the central obsessions of all of Brenner's protagonists, appears as the child's implacable foe.29 If that sack represents the womb, then the father is not only threat- ening the child's life, he is attempting to prevent his very birth. The fear of the father is juxtaposed in the dream with another, not unrelated fear, that provoked by the erotic woman. Feuermann sees himself as a repugnant insect whose wings the young woman casually rips off, a symbolic act of cas- tration. In both cases, Feuermann sees himself as a victim, but as the imagery of the dream suggests ("a dirty sack," "a fly"), Feuermann also sees himself as a repulsive creature whose victimization, whether from a life- denying father or a castrating woman, is not entirely undeserved. 29.

BRENNER'S IN WINTER 93 This emphasis upon victimization is also present in the evocation of the childhood dream of Hell. But a new element in this dream provides us with additional insight into Feuermann's fascination with a past he abhors. The presence of a "chorus" whose lamentations accompany the child's ascents and descents among the icy circles of Hell introduces an element of pathos into the scene. The victim is not alone, and his terrible fate does not go un- recognized. The dream, then, in spite of the terror it evokes, represents a wish-fulfillment. Feuermann receives the sympathy that he feels he was denied in his childhood and which, as an adult, he cannot give himself. The unconscious processes of the dream-work reflect, and help explain, Feuer- mann's attraction to a past which repells him: he must evoke his past in order to reexperience the punishment which his sense of guilt convinces him he deserves and, at the same time, to seek the sympathy he feels he has been denied. In Winter concludes, as do most autobiographical narratives, when the narrative of the past events converges upon the moment of writing. In this case, however, the convergence is of special significance, for it compels Feuermann to consider, once again, his relationship to his past and to his efforts to record it. He finally concludes that, although many more pages remain in his notebook, it would be futile to continue writing because he will never be able to "tell all." The winter drama of his life must always be marked, "to be continued." All the old fears and obsessions, the sense of irrevocable guilt and repulsion as well as the fatal attraction to self-analysis and doubt, remain. The only alternatives that Feuermann sees at this point are insanity or the "liberation" of suicide: In my Scripture now is found the following verse: See, before you lie two paths: the first involuntary, the second voluntary - insanity or suicide. Now choose death! (p. 58) In the end, Feuermann pursues neither of these alternatives, but a kind of temporary liberation comes from an unexpected place. I am silent and I stop writing, that filthy labor. What was I thinking? I shall dash the cursed pen ... (p. 58) Feuermann does not dash the pen (three more chapters remain to be writ- ten), but this expression of rage proves to be cathartic: for the moment, at least, he can look forward to the future as well as back to the past, and even</page><page sequence="16">94 JEFFREY FLECK see in that future cause for hope. "I know that the second half of my life will be completely different," he writes to his friend Davidovsky. "What do I have to do with probing scalpels?" Liberated for the moment from scalpel, if not pen, Feuermann can write the last chapters of his narrative (now more diary than autobiography) with an uncharacteristic stoic restraint and calm that are especially striking after the frantic introspection of the preceding chapters. How can we describe this catharsis and the radical shift in tone that fol- lows on its heels other than as an "event" in the narrating instance. Feuer- mann's recoiling from the act of narrating, expressed in his (unfulfilled) intention to dash his pen, is in fact no different in quality than the numerous other retractions and false starts, those traces of the narrating instance, that fill his narrative. The only difference here is that Feuermann, for the first time, directs his wrath not at himself, not at his own deficiencies, but at the act of writing. If earlier the problem was that his past was "gloomy and wretched," that he was a "nonhero," that he lacked the "art" to properly explain things, that his lust cannot be called "love," that he is stupid to use a "banal" term, here the problem is not in his past or in the type of man that past has made him, but in his present action, an action that, he now seems to discover for the first time, can be stopped. What Feuermann discovers is that his effort to "tell all" is not only futile but unnecessary. The "second half" of his life lies before him, and it will be - or so it appears to him at this point - "completely different." The catharsis, however, remains problematic and no doubt transitory. In the final entry of his autobiography-diary, Feuermann tells how he finds refuge from the wintery night - and an anti-Semitic stationmaster - under some timber piled behind a provincial train station on the way to the "second half" of his life. The imagery of winter has returned, and with it Feuermann's physical and spiritual isolation. Nothing has really been solved, no demons have been exorcised once and for all. Still, Feuermann's affirmation of the richness and complexity of life that "transcend all analy- sis," however ephemeral it may be, opens up possibilities which, while under the sway of the past, simply did not exist for him. The apparent formlessness of the plots of Brenner's novels - and par- ticularly of In Winter - has long been considered a weak point in his narra- tive art even by those who accepted it as a necessary though unfortunate corollary of his subject matter.30 The plot of In Winter, however, appears 30. See, for example, Gershon Shaked, Hasiporet ha'ivrit (Jerusalem: Hotsa'at Keter, 1977), pp. 375-376.</page><page sequence="17">Y. H. BRENNER'S IN WINTER 95 formless only when it is analyzed according to conventional notions of plot structure, that is, when plot is viewed as a correlation of narrative units denoting actions in the narrated time, and when the link between chronolo- gical and logical order is sought exclusively at that level. If, on the other hand, we approach the narrative units from the point of view of the narrat- ing instance and consider them as acts of narration, another plot emerges whose regulating principle is neither logical nor chronological but rather psychological. The form of this plot is essentially cyclical and, at the most abstract level, can be reduced to four actions: (1) to remember, (2) to nar- rate, (3) to respond to the act of narration, and (4) to stop narrating. The first three actions, of course, constitute the cycle; the fourth action is the escape hatch, as it were, that brings the cycle to an end, and with it, the nar- rative itself. As we have seen, the cycle is reflected at all levels of the narra- tive, from the syntax of statement and retraction, to the organization and juxtaposition of larger narrative units, all the way to the global structure that pits the entire narrative, so to speak, against the statement "I will dash the cursed pen." It is only by reference to this structure that the denouement of In Winter can be understood. For, as we have seen, this denouement does not take place in the narrated past; it is neither caused nor constituted by a specific event in Feuermann's "autobiography." Rather, it takes place in the narrat- ing instance, at the moment when Feuermann, closed in by the inevitable convergence of narrated time and time of narration, turns his rage upon the act of writing and, as a result, "liberates" himself from his obsession with the past. Feuermann's need for such a liberation set the narrative into motion; once achieved (even if temporarily), the narrative loses its raison d'etre and grinds to a halt.
