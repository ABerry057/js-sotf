<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eyal Regev. The Sadducees and Their Halakhah: Religion and Society in the Second Temple Period. Jerusalem: Yad Ben-Zvi, 2005. 457 pp. This book is a revised and expanded version of Eyal Regev's doctoral dis- sertation, which was submitted to the senate of Bar-Ilan University in 1999. It addresses the question of who were the Sadducees and discusses the various rab- binic sources that mention the halakhic stances of the Sadducees and Baethesians pertaining to "The Sabbath and the Calendar" (Chap. 2), "Criminal and Civil Law" (Chap. 3), "The Temple Cult" (Chap. 4), and "Purity Laws" (Chap. 5). In these chapters, Regev interprets the halakhic stances attributed to the Sadducees by the rabbinic sources. He does not stop there, however; he proceeds to uncover the "Principles of the Sadducean Halakhah," especially by juxtaposing it to "Phar- isaic, Qumranic and Samaritan Halakhah" (Chap. 6). Regev follows Daniel Schwartz's classification of the "priestly" halakhah as "realistic" and the Pharisaic/rabbinic halakhah as "nominalistic" (206-207). He prefers, however, a different terminology: a "dynamic" versus "static" conception of holiness from which the halakhic disagreements emanate, in his view. The Sadducees, according to his suggestion, embrace the former, whereas the Pharisees hold the latter conception (238-46). Based on his findings and analysis in these chapters, Regev proceeds to address some broader questions that concentrate primarily on sociopolitical issues: "The Status of the Sadducees in the Hasmonean Period" (Chap. 7), "The Influence of the Sadducees in the Herodian Period" (Chap. 8), "Who Ruled the Temple in the Herodian Period: Sadducees/Priests or Pharisees/ Rabbis?" (Chap. 9), and finally, "The Sadducee-Pharisee Struggle" (Chap. 10). He characterizes the Pharisaic innovation as the institutionalization of the study of Torah (380-83). "The Pharisees," he writes, "strove to attract the lay people to the personal intellectual ability to study Torah and to know halakhah, or at least to instruct the masses with the awareness of the importance of the study of Torah" (381). Furthermore, "It is possible to go further and to assert that the Phar- isees turned the study of Torah into a value separate from [Temple] worship, and perhaps even higher than it" (ibid.). The Sadducees, in contrast, were centered 445</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews around the Temple and its cult (383) and viewed the "priest" as a higher figure than the "sage" (385-92). Because, in Regev's view, "The Pharisees and their con- ceptions were a socio-religious novum with respect to the world of the Sadducees" (396), it would have been of value to discuss Martin Goodman's opposite sugges- tion that "the Pharisees were essentially conservative in behavior, and, incidentally the Sadducean rejection of normal custom far more radical than it is usually portrayed."' The book concludes with appendices on "The Sadducees and the Archeo- logical Findings" (404-12) and "The History of Research of the Sadducees and Their Laws" (413-20). Regev's discussions are illuminating in many cases. Consider, for example, the well-known dispute concerning the date of the sheaf offering ('omer) given "on the morrow of the Sabbath" (Leviticus 23: 13). The Pharisaic tradition read "the Sabbath" to mean "the Festival," thus insisting that the 'omer be offered on the day after the Passover sacrifice. Their opponents, however, insisted that the offering be brought after the Sabbath following Passover. This insistence is not, as is usually claimed, an example of "literalism" but an attempt to avoid the possibility that the 'omer would be reaped on Shabbat itself (84). The project, as a whole, suffers from some methodological problems. First, it must be acknowledged that the number of halakhot that can safely be ascribed to the Sadducees is quite small,2 and this renders any pretension to speak of "the Sadducean halakhah" dubious. For this reason, Regev needs to "enlarge" the corpus of "Sadducean" halakhot. He does this by means of seeing another Second Temple group referred to by rabbinic sources, the Baethesians, as identical (at least for halakhic matters) to the Sadducees (32-58). This identification, however, is questionable. As Regev himself admits, his ultimate reason for accept- ing it is that without this assumption, the corpus of Sadducean halakhot would be extremely limited and would not allow him to say anything substantial about the Sadducees and their halakhah. One can sympathize with such a line of thought, but I doubt whether it can be considered an accepted methodological justification. One example will suffice to illustrate the difficulty of accepting the assump- tion that Baethesian halakhah and Sadducean halakhah are one and the same. In 1. See Martin Goodman, "Note on Josephus, the Pharisees and Ancestral Tradition," Journal of Jewish Studies 50 (1999): 17-20, at 18. Elsewhere, I suggest that because "text-based ideologies, as a rule, are of secondary and reformative character vis-a-vis the prevailing, 'tradition-based,' type of reli- giosity, it might be argued that the Sadducean halakha is a revolutionary return to the text, not a con- servative preservation of ancient, biblical tradition." See Adiel Schremer, "[T]he[y] Did Not Read in the Sealed Book: Qumran Halakhic Revolution and the Emergence of Torah Study in Second Temple Judaism," in Historical Perspectives.: From the Hasmoneans to Bar Kokhba in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ed. David Goodblatt, Avital Pinnick, and Daniel R. Schwartz (Leiden, UK: Brill, 2001), 105-26, 123 n. 56. 2. Even if we accept Regev's numeration, it would not yield more than sixteen halakhot (33-34). But this number, too, is far from certain, as many of these halakhot are attributed to the Sadducees only in late and problematic works, such as the Babylonian Talmud and the Scholion to Megilat Ta 'anit. 446</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews T. Sukkah 3:1, we are told that the Baethesians did not "concur that beating the willow-branches overrides the prohibitions of the Sabbath" (pr11n l'=n' 1p': . nM nz r nM 7 M7nz * tl1'nW). The plain meaning is that the Baethesians did not reject the custom altogether but only insisted that it should not be conducted on Shabbat. Because, however, this custom has no biblical foundation, it may reason- ably be argued that it would have been rejected by the Sadducees, who, according to Josephus (Ant. 13.297), rejected those "Pharisaic" traditions that were not grounded in the Torah. Hence, at least in this case, it seems that the halakhic stance attributed to the Baethesians was different from that of the Sadducees. Furthermore, most of the sources on which Regev builds his historical reconstruction are rabbinic. Some of them are of tannaitic provenance, but others are much later. Regev is aware of the difficulties in using these materials, but he maintains that our doubts should be restricted only to the argumentational component in each tradition, not to its core, that is, the very halakhic stance ascribed to the Sadducees (14-19). Despite the temptation to follow such a distinc- tion, one must also consider the possibility that rabbinic sources may have represented the halakhic stances of their opponents in a distorted manner so as to more easily mock and reject them. Consequently, we should be much more cautious in accepting these rabbinic testimonies at face value. Regev correctly notes that it is insufficient to speak of the halakhic contro- versy between the Pharisees/rabbis and the Sadducees merely in terms of leniency and stringency. For, as he correctly observes, in the majority of the cases, the con- troversy is much more fundamental. Here, in my opinion, is one of Regev's most interesting discoveries: the qualitative difference between the controversies between Pharisees and Sadducees/Baethesians and those of the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai. The former differ fundamentally; the latter only dis- agree on leniency and stringency (204-206). This may give us a clue as to why rabbinic sources do not consider the Shammai/Hillel schism equal to that of the sects. However, Regev's attempt to explain the differences between the Sadducean and the Pharisaic halakhah as reflecting their conceptions of holiness-static versus dynamic-is itself problematic. For, after all, these terms are Regev's own construction; nowhere in the sources do we find any statement showing the Sadducees to hold a "dynamic" conception of holiness. In fact, according to Regev's own methodological assumption-according to which, he does not rely on the argumentation and rationales attributed by rabbinic sources to the Saddu- cees but rather accepts only the halakhic concrete stances ascribed to them- such a statement cannot even be found because we do not possess, in reality, any "Sadducean" statement. Thus, Regev's claim that "[t]he vast majority of [halakhic] disagreements between the Sadducees and the Pharisees (17 out of 21) are related to the problem of holiness" and his attempt to explain this situation are misleading. The view that these halakhic controversies are related to concepts of holiness is not stated by the sources themselves but rather is Regev's own interpretation. In a sense, then, it may be argued that Regev is not analyzing the Sadducean halakhah but his own construction. Unfortunately, I cannot say that Regev's use of the sociological and anthro- pological secondary literature is as adequate and prudent as it should be. For 447</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews example, he writes, "My guiding assumption, here as well as in the tenth chapter, is influenced by an important branch of cultural anthropology in general, and that of anthropology of religion in particular: the behavior of human beings, religious rituals, social activities-all are related to world view" (229). Such a formu- lation seems to me a superfluous presentation of a much more complex, deep, and sophisticated scholarly stance. Regev maintains that "Geertz is the most well-known representative of this approach, but its roots can be found already in Durkheim and it is accepted by many anthropologists and among many students of religion" (ibid. n. 41). I doubt whether Geertz would sign on to Regev's formulation, nor do I think it needs to be described as an assumption that specifically characterizes the thought of cultural anthropologists or anthropologists of religion in particular. In general, Regev's style leaves the reader with the uncomfortable impression that too often, theoretical (sociologi- cal and anthropological but also other) scholarly views are simplified. Notwithstanding these remarks, Regev succeeds in presenting a historical picture that will certainly be taken into account by further studies of Jewish society during the Second Temple period in general and of the Sadducees in particular.
