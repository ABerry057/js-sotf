Life Between Memory and Hope: The Survivors of the Holocaust in Occupied Germany. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 348 pp. In the last decade or so, new research on Jewish displaced persons in oc- cupied Germany has pushed the traditional boundaries of "Holocaust studies" (1933-1945) toward the postwar period. Indeed, the displaced persons or "DP" experience-the temporary settlement in Germany of the She'erith Hapleitah ("Surviving Remnant") from the liberation of concentration camps in the spring of 1945 to the late 1940s-provides important insights into post-Holocaust Jew- ish life. The impact of trauma and loss, the final divorce between Jews and East- Central Europe through migration to Israel and the New World, the rise of Zionist consciousness, the shaping of a Jewish national collective in transit, the regener- ation of Jewish demography and culture in the DP camps, and the relationships between Jews and Germans in occupied Germany are some of the many themes 378</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews explored by recent DP historiography-by now a subfield of postwar Jewish his- tory. Although different in nature and scope, the two books under review, Zeev Mankowitz's Life Between Memory and Hope and Ruth Gay's Safe Among the Ger- mans, both center on the singularity of Jewish refugee life after the war. A very un- likely prospect during the war, mass migration of the remnant of European Jewry to occupied Germany brought Jewish life back to the German space. The dramat- ic twist of fate provoked by V-Day turned Germany into a safe sanctuary for 60,000 Holocaust survivors freed from the camps or converging to the American zone from Eastern Europe. All in all, 250,000 Jews, Polish in their large majority, moved to Germany, illegally or semi-illegally, between 1945 and 1949. As Ruth Gay writes in her introduction, "The decision of Eastern European Jews to settle in Ger- many at that time seemed unthinkable to the rest of the world in view of the near- ly realized intent of the Nazi regime to kill every one of them." But the title of her book is somewhat misleading when applied to the postwar occupation period (1945-1949). Jews were indeed "safe" in Germany after May 1945, but did not for the most part live "among Germans." Their sense of safety derived primarily from the protective environment provided by the extraterritorial DP camps of the Amer- ican and British zones of occupation, which separated Jews from Germans and turned Jewish victims into "victors" by association. This spatial isolation, howev- er, was hardly hermetic, since various forms of interactions-black market activ- ities, the enrollment of Jewish students in German universities, or the highly symbolic hiring by Jewish women of German nannies-occurred between Holo- caust survivors and the German population. As safe havens for survivors and Jews fleeing the resurgence of anti-Semi- tism in their "home" country (such as the Kielce pogrom of 1946), DP camps became sites of physical, cultural, and political regeneration. This episode of au- tonomous Jewish reconstruction has for a long time been repressed by trauma-in- spired literature as well as by early Zionist narratives, which for different reasons have cultivated the image of survivors as passive victims denied historical agency. In this respect, the accounts provided by Ruth Gay and Zeev Mankowitz are re- minders that mourning and powerlessness do not fully convey the survivor expe- rience in Germany. Equally important was the active Jewish struggle for rebirth and regeneration, both demographic and intellectual. Emblematic of the way sur- vivors simultaneously addressed past and future is a Yiddish song composed by the Happy Boys, a Jewish music band popular in the DP camps. As Ruth Gay points out, their nostalgic Es bengt zich nuch a hajm (One Longs for Home) gradually shifts away from the past as it summons new beginnings: "Now one must live be- cause the time has come!" Whereas Life Between Memory and Hope is a thorough historical investiga- tion based on a wide array of primary sources and exclusively focusing on the pe- riod 1945-1948, Safe Among the Germans is a general overview of Jewish life in Germany from the Holocaust to the 1990s. Historians of the period should not ex- pect to find new material or new arguments in Ruth Gay's otherwise elegantly writ- ten book. Michael Brenner, Frank Stern, and Jeffrey Herf have written more specialized historical accounts on Jews in West and East Germany since 1945. 379</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews However, one can still enjoy Gay's engaging narrative as well as her fruitful use of secondary sources, often giving voice to heretofore anonymous historical wit- nesses. Overall, Gay's aim is to highlight what she views as a success story: the reemergence, against all odds, of Jewish life and culture in postwar Germany. The author aptly describes a closing of a cycle, while carefully refraining from roman- ticization. She shows how "native" German Jews (amounting to only 8,000 in 1950) struggled to reconstruct a post-Holocaust identity. Departing from their pre- war belief in the German-Jewish symbiosis, survivors defined themselves more ambiguously as "Jews in Germany." Upon their return home, they encountered the cold indifference of their former German "neighbors," but also faced the ostracism of Jews in the outside world who scorned their desire to remain on the "blood- soaked soil" of Germany. Moreover, "native" German Jews experienced tense re- lations with Jewish outsiders-the 12,000 Eastern European DPs who stayed in Germany after the closing of DP camps in the early 1950s. In Chapters 4 and 5, the most interesting part of the book, Ruth Gay treats another type of East-West divide. Following the end of the airlift in 1949, Jews in East and West Berlin dramatically parted ways, and Gay offers a fascinating ac- count of the many difficulties faced by the Jewish community in the "antifascist" German Democratic Republic. Yet a steady trickle of escapes to the Federal Re- public gradually emptied East Germany of most of its Jewish population, reduced to less than 2,000 souls in 1956. Jumping ahead to the post-reunification era, a fi- nal chapter focuses on "New Generations in Germany," on the vibrancy of Jewish culture (symbolized notably by the revival of klezmer music) and the impact of Russian immigration. For Ruth Gay, the 100,000 Jews who today live "safe among the Germans" are neither a "remnant" community nor an anomaly, but a dynamic and legitimate center of Jewish life in the West. If the DP experience is treated by Ruth Gay as an introduction to the broad- er postwar period, the return to life of Holocaust survivors in occupied Germany is the primary focus of Zeev Mankowitz's book. This is, to date, the most compre- hensive study of the She'erith Hapleitah, enriched by a thorough examination of primary sources in Yiddish, such as the survivor press. It is a story written from the perspective of the historical actors ("She'erith Hapleitah as subjects rather than as objects of history") and a fine analysis of their motivations. The first part of the book explores the dual origins of the She'erith Hapleitah. The Surviving Remnant was created bothfrom below and from above: it was an early attempt by survivors to organize themselves after the liberation of the camps as well as a result of relief policies stressing the necessity of assisting Holocaust survivors in separate Jewish camps. Mankowitz's analysis of the community of survivors revolves around a cen- tral question: How did they return to life and grapple "with the weight of the past, the strains of the present and the shape of a different future"? Against the claims of post-Zionist writers who have described survivors as victims of cynical Zionist designs, Mankowitz presents strong evidence of the rise of Zionist consciousness in the camps. Although competing with Bundism or Orthodox Judaism, Zionist sentiment (as well as anti-British attitudes) was prevalent among survivors even before the arrival of official Zionist "emissaries" in the camps. Yet the predomi- 380</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews nance of Zionism did not diminish the lure of America, especially after the U.S. Congress passed the DP Act in 1948. As Mankowitz shows in his discussion of Samuel Gringauz, a leading figure of the Landsberg DP camp in Bavaria, Zionism could also be perceived as a language of rebirth and a "new humanism," above and beyond the personal duty to live in the newly created State of Israel. The concept of "Life Reborn" was also tied to an institutional and educa- tional project. Mankowitz examines the role of the Central Committee of Liberat- ed Jews in integrating Jewish repatriates and "infiltrees" from Eastern Europe into the She'erith Hapleitah. Education and vocational training (for surviving children and adults alike) also played a regenerative role in healing the "deep scars of the past left on body and soul." But the most manifest embodiment of rebirth was de- mographic. As survivors rediscovered intimacy and sexuality, an extraordinary baby boom took place in the camps: "Every third woman was either pregnant or pushing a baby carriage," noted a relief worker in 1946. This theme is currently being pushed further by historians interested in adding a gender dimension to the history of survivors. Reproductive politics could be framed as a symbolic form of "revenge" against the Germans, epitomized by the proud parading of prams in front of German eyes. As Mankowitz shows in a chapter on Jewish attitudes to- ward Germany, violent revenge against Germans remained marginal, even if often fantasized. For survivors, settling scores was more a memory issue than it was a retributive one. In a section on commemoration, Mankowitz describes how She'erith Hapleitah organized public remembrance through the creation of memo- rial days later amended-and appropriated?-by the specific commemorative needs of the State of Israel. Overall, this outstanding work combines intriguing questions, solid re- search, and moving testimonies. It restores dignity and "life" to the history of sur- vivors and opens up a subsequent question: the nature of post-Holocaust Jewish resilience and its role as a core value in Israeli society after 1948.
