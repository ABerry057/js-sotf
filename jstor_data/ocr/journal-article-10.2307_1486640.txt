Polish Jews in Paris: The Ethnography of Memot3j Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991. x, 195 pp. Although much has been written about East European immigrants and Yiddish culture in the United States, the experience of Polish Jews in France is much less well known. Only in recent years have historians and social scientists begun to tell of the once rich Yiddish cultural life in Paris. In Polish</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 279 Jews in Paris, Jonathan Boyarin adds an interesting chapter, perhaps the last, on the individual and cultural remnants of that experience. A young anthropologist who learned Yiddish at YIVO in New York, Boyarin did his field studies for his doctoral thesis among the individual and organizational remnants of the once-thriving Labor Zionist, Bundist, Communist, and ex-Communist Yiddish-speaking Polish Jews in Paris. This book is a product of the year he spent living with the Polish Jews of Paris and of several subsequent shorter visits in the mid-1980s. Polish and other East European Jews began entering France in significant numbers during the 1890s. The flow of immigrants increased dramatically after World War I as the United States began to close its doors and France welcomed them to replace her severe losses during the war. Once the Depression began, however, France instituted a quota on immigration and made it increasingly difficult for the earlier immigrants to gain naturalization. In all, it is estimated that 15,000, mostly Polish, Jews settled in France between the wars. During World War II over 55,000 of these so-called "foreign Jews" were deported to Auschwitz. Few returned. After the war, several thousand Polish Jewish survivors settled in France, embellishing the numbers though not completely reviving the once-exciting political and cultural community. From the 1850s on, East European Jewish immigrants settled in the northeastern sections of Paris, particularly in the old Jewish quarter of the Pletzl in the Marais and in the working-class strongholds of Belleville and R6publique. Most came from Poland and brought with them the diversity of Jewish life there. While many retained their traditional Judaism, others looked to Zionism, Bundism, or Bolshevism as modern paths to rectify the Jewish and human condition. The largely Yiddish-speaking newcomers established a thriving Yiddish press, many cultural and political organizations and, of course, numerous landsmanshaftn. The landsmanshaftn constitute the organizational core of the Polish Jewish community in Paris. Formed at the end of the ninteenth century, the landsmanshaftn brought together poor, proletarian Jews from the same "hometowns" in Poland for mutual aid and companionship, a Yiddish cultural life, and proper burial. Like the more political organizations the Polish Jews belonged to, the landsmanshatfn served both as a reinforcer of ther separate Jewish identity and as a way to gradually integrate into French life. Boyarin argues, however, that in more recent years the landsmanshaftn have changed focus. They now serve primarily as a means to commemorate the Polish</page><page sequence="3">280 BOOK REVIEWS communities their members once came from, which were destroyed in the Shoah and are almost forgotten by their own fading memories. This change in focus has a sad if not tragic undercurrent. Ultimately, the focus on commemoration reveals the transparent doom of Yiddish cultural and political life in France after World War II. Boyarin argues that regrettably these immigrants were unable to find a satisfactory way to integrate their French experience with their radical and Yiddish upbringings. In part this was due, Boyarin suggests, to the lack of "cultural space" for ethnic expression in France. But more importantly, like Yiddish immigrants elsewhere who rejected Jewish religious traditions, the Polish Jews of Paris have found little to nourish themselves or to transmit to their children after the collapse of their dreams during and after the war. Proud of their children's professional and business successes, the parents nevertheless remain ambivalent about their children's lack of Jewish identity. Boyarin has written what he himself describes as a somewhat unconven- tional ethnographic study of the Yiddish cultural community in Paris. It is unconventional both in the postmodern explanatory framework he uses to tell the immigrants' story(ies) and in the interweaving of his own story during the year that he and his wife lived among the city's Polish Jews. Boyarin includes his own story because he wants to be able to explain and analyze what he sees without seeming "superior" to the immigrant experience he is dissecting. Presumably, the telling of both his and their stories simultaneously, openly recognizes the different "frames of meaning" that invariably persist between researcher and subject. Although Boyarin tells both "stories" interestingly, this historian found his style unnecessarily apologetic, confusing, and awkwardly informal at times. This seemed especially so in the light of the rather esoteric theoretical framework that occasionally obtrudes. Boyarin describes his approach as an "ethnography of postmodernism." Since there is no "true" story or history, the immigrants only have the memories of their own stories, stories which once gave their lives meaning and guidance but which no longer do so. In this sense, the lives of his subjects reflect a postmodern dilemma that all secular Jews, indeed, according to Boyarin, all of Western civilization, face. Boyarin uses the postmodern critique of the traditional master narrative of redemption, and the Enlightenment master narrative of progress, as a way of describing and explaining the only partially integrated strivings, dislocations, and disillusionments of these Yiddish immigrants. According to Boyarin,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 281 although their once-radical critiques of Western capitalist societies may still have something to teach us, by and large history has ended for these erstwhile Polish Jewish Communists, socialists, and Labor Zionists. Before World War II they had visions, albeit different ones, of a story with a happy ending, based on continuing progress if not ultimate redemption. But their personal histories, "stories," ended with World War II. Their dreams shattered by the Shoah, by disillusionment with communism, and even by an imperfect Zion, they now just "get by." Israel, funerals, commemorations, and formal dinners provide only an incomplete and nontransmittable basis for a shared life with their children and with the newly dominant North African Jewish community. Told with affection and at times poignancy, Boyarin weaves the im- migrants' stories into an interesting patchwork of the various aspects of their contemporary cultural experiences and attitudes. He also searchingly explores the dilemmas they face. Still, I am not convinced that the postmodern theories he imposes help us to better understand dilemmas faced, after all, by all immigrants. Near the end of the book Boyarin suggests that these Jewish immigrants need to rethink the master narrative that has guided their lives. Perhaps then they could find a way to build a living Jewish identity in their new world. If only it were that easy.
