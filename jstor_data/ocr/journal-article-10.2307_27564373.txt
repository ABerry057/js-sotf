Discussing Cultural Influences: Text, Context and Non-Text in Rabbinic Judaism. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 2007. viii, 248 pp. doi:10.1017/S036400940800130X How Should Rabbinic Literature Be Read in the Modern World? edited by Matthew Kraus (University of Cincinnati), with an introduction by Richard S. Sarason (Hebrew Union College/Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati), con tains seven chapters assessing the historical value of rabbinic texts in light of oral and literary criticism. The book is an amalgam of invited conference papers pre sented at Williams College on October 26-27, 2003. Though the essays vary widely in intent and scope, they show methodological perspectives drawn from contextual interpretation and comparative study. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss features of oral tradition that underlie written rab binic texts. Martin S. Jaffee (University of Washington), "What Difference Does the 'Orality' of Rabbinic Writing Make for The Interpretation of Rabbinic Writ ings" (11-33), suggests that symmetry in parallel rabbinic texts is not necessarily derived from a presumed Urtext or an existing text drawing from another but gen erated from mnemonic cues and stock phrases found in rabbinic oral tradition. Alyssa Gray (Hebrew Union College/Jewish Institute of Religion, New York), "A Bavli Sugya and its Two Yerushalmi Parallels: Issues of Literary Relationship and Redaction" (35-77), analyzes the discussion on who and what makes a zimmun ("convocation" for Grace) in B. Ber. 47b-48b and similar Palestinian rab binic discussion in Y. Ber. 7:2, and Gen. Rab. 91:4. She opines that the apparent hybrid version in the Bavli of the older Palestinian texts is most likely a Babylo nian redaction of a common oral version of the sugya. Charlotte Elisheva Fonro bert (Stanford University), "The Semiotics of the Sexed Body in Early Halakhic Discourse" (79-104), explores the semiotics of gender identities from the rabbinic-halakhic and the Greco-Roman worldviews. Her contextual cultural study argues that the fundamental issue of gender dimorphism in Jewish law is reproduction and fertility. Are aggadic and halakhic stories history or literature? This question is tweaked in Hillel I. Newman (University of Haifa), "Closing the Circle: Yonah Fraenkel, the Talmudic Story, and Rabbinic History" (105-35). Here Newman disagrees with Yonah Fraenkel's ("this generation's most sensitive, insightful and eloquent interpreter of the rabbinic story") literary approach, which is constricted by reading the text against itself. Rather, Newman reasons that contextual and cultural studies evidence a kernel of history in the rabbinic narrative. In the following chapter, Jeffrey L. Rubenstein (New York University), "Context and Genre: Elements of a Literary Approach to the Rabbinic Narrative" (137-65), cites the story of Elisha ben Abuya, the pardes tradition, and agricultural tall tales (among others) to analyze issues of content, genre, and redaction in a Bavli sugya. Oded Irshai (Hebrew University), "Ephraim E. Urbach and the Study of Judeo-Christian Dialogue in Late Antiquity?Some Preliminary Observations" 418</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews (167-97), explains why in Ephraim Urbach's World of the Sages there is minimal Jewish-Christian interaction, including the lack of any sustaining Adversus Chris tianity polemics (present, however, in post-talmudic biblical exegesis and homi letics). The centrifugal force of the rabbinic mind is halakhah, and the sources and development of halakhah are considered by Urbach within its own internal cultural, religious, and theological constraints, thereby excluding dependency on externalities such as Christian exegesis and homiletics. The value of the latter, however, is clearly recognized by the historian Yitzhak Baer's position, which Urbach refutes in no uncertain terms. The final chapter by Steven Fine (Yeshiva University), "Archaeology and the Interpretation of Rabbinic Literature: Some Thoughts" (199-217), provides an overview of talmudic archaeology and its importance in understanding nuances of the Talmud in print. Editor Matthew Kraus writes that the expressed goal of the Williams College symposium was an interactive dialogue between the scholars?and an invitation to learn by others?on their approaches to reading talmudic literature. This volume sans the dialogical component is the result of their efforts to "build(ing) hermeneu tical bridges." Discussing Cultural Influences is an edited version of lectures presented at the Jewish Studies Conference on Rabbinic Judaism held at Bucknell University in 2004 under the sponsorship of the John D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur Chair in Jewish Studies. Rivka Kern Ulmer, the MacArthur Chair, herself deeply involved in writing on contextual study of midrashic texts, invited well-known experts of rabbinic Judaism to expound on their respective fields of study. The essays discuss topics of Judaism from the Second Temple period, late antiquity, and the early medieval period. Throughout the volume, the Bible and the rabbinic texts are considered as documents of human instruction divinely bestowed, with the assumption that many aspects of rabbinic worldviews developed in awareness of and response to cultures other than merely internal rabbinic discourse. This collection of seven essays represents a sampling of talmudic and mid rashic passages, with a focus on halakhah and theology (parochial and compara tive), word and topical study, and hermeneutics. Lawrence Schiffman (New York University), "Legal Texts and Codification in the Dead Sea Scrolls" (1-39), demonstrates distinctive differences in legal rulings and in conceptions of auth ority between the Zadokite/Sadducean authors and redactors of Torah laws and the sectarian regulations found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (primarily, CD [Damascus Document or Zadokite Fragments], 4QMMT [Mikzaot Ma'aseh ha-torah], 1QS [Manual of Discipline], lQSa [Serekh ha-Edah], HQTemple [Temple Scroll], 4Q265 [Serekh Damascus], and minor legal works) and the rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud. The Qumran codes, except in regard to organizational rules, focus on scriptural law as-is, whereas the sages consider the complete cano nized Torah and then some (M. Hag. 1:8). Nonetheless, a commonality of method and style is noted. Mayer I. Gruber (Ben Gurion University of the Negev), "The Term Midrash in Tannaitic Literature" (41-58), challenges the modern accepted assertion that the term midrash in the Mishnah (M. 'Avot 1:17, M. Ket. 4:6, M. Ned. 4:3, and M. Shek. 6:6) and in the Tosefta (10-12 attestations), with or without the formula di-khetiv or she-ne'emar, speaks of scriptural prooftexts. 419</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews To define midrash properly is to reexamine the term in the context of the text that it occurs, which, in his opinion, does not conform to the traditional understanding of scriptural exegesis and eisegesis. Additional analysis from Sifre to Numbers, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Sifra, and Sifre Deuteronomy suggests how the term midrash (the lexeme denotes rabbinical interpretation of scripture) became a commentary on a scriptural passage and later rabbinic compositions on biblical passages. Reuven Kimelman (Brandeis University), "Polemics and Rabbinic Liturgy" (59-97), seeks to discover the background and role of three significant liturgical themes (resurrection, the decalogue, and divine sovereignty). He argues that they are compositions of internal developments rather than reactions to external challenges. Thus, tehiyat ha-metim is prominent in the 'amidah because its theol ogy of afterlife articulates rabbinic anthropology {guf and neshamah) in this life. Similarly, the theology of the 'aseret ha-dibrot on the unity and sovereignty of God was deemed redundant to the Shema and its paragraphs on the acceptance of divine kingship, and so it was removed from daily prayer. Further, the centrality of God's kingdom and kingship in daily and festival liturgy is less a response to Greco-Roman emperor worship or sectarian beliefs and more intrinsically connected to biblical idea of God the Creator and Redeemer. Holger Zellentin (Princeton University), "Rabbinizing Jesus, Christanizing the Son of David: The Bavli's Approach to the Secondary Messiah Traditions" (99-127), discusses the distinctions between Y Suk. 5.2 (23b) and B. Suk. 52a-b on Zech 12:10. For the version in the Bavli, Zellentin considers rabbinic knowledge of the Gospel of Luke's adoption theology (i.e., Jesus, the supposed son of Joseph is adopted as God's begotten son) and the passion narrative. As the Bavli focuses on the death of the "pierced one" {kifshuto, "martyrs" or in the messianic time, Messiah the son of Joseph), it keeps the image of the rabbinic Messiah son of David intact and triumphant. Yaakov Elman (Yeshiva University), "He in His Cloak and She in Her Cloak: Conflicting Images of Sexuality in Sasanian Mesopotamia" (129-63), describes glimpses of intimacy in the lives of several third- and fourth-generation Babylonian Amoraim and traces their views on Jewish mores in sex and marriage to the centuries old Babylonian Jewry interface with Zoroastrianism, where simi larities and differences in law, custom, ethical conduct, and eschatological belief are noted. Elman's contextual study reveals the impact of Sassanian culture on Mesopotamian Jewish sexual attitudes in law and lore. Herbert W. Basser (Queen's University), "Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai: Literary Motifs" (165-92), evaluates conflicting data presented in the Bavli and Yerush almi on the role of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai: miracle worker and charismatic or rationalist and legalist, coexistent peacenik or revolutionary zealot. Basser argues that the views presented in the talmudic literature reflect the realpolitik of the sages under Roman occupation. It should be noted that Basser's chapter is an updated and revised version of a previously published article, "Uncovering the Plots: The Image of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai" (in J. Neusner, ed., The Mathers ' Lectures and Other Papers in the Study of Judaism an Queen 's College [Binghamton: Global, 2001], 37-62). Finally, Rivka Kern Ulmer 420</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews (Bucknell University and Yale University), "Visions of Egypt in Midrash: the Nile as the Landscape of the Other" (193-234), explicates rabbinic awareness of ancient Egypt typography and worldviews under the rubric of the Nile-as-Other and also provides some insight to midrashic polemics. Collectively, the essayists show admirable skills and refreshing thought in fulfilling the purpose of this work. Unfortunately, however, it lacks consistency in transliteration and syntactical matters, and also there are formatting blunders. Nonetheless, this is a formidable collection on the ins and outs of contextual rabbinic reading.
