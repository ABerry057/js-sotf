Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1983. 195 pp. with bibliography and index. This terse but scholarly and thorough genre study illustrates an impor- tant rule: less can be more. By restricting herself to a set of texts that share small features with surprising precision, Martha Himmelfarb obtains results that are of substance for much larger questions. Her topic is the "tour of hell," a literary format most familiar in Dante, but which has a long prehis- tory, in which a series of visions of the punishments of the damned are explained to a visitor by a guide. But her context is the whole visionary literature called "apocalyptic," and specifically the problems of its origins in early Hellenistic Judaism, its cultivation in the apocryphal literature of the intertestamental period, and its modes of transmission in rabbinical, Chris- tian, and Muslim traditions. The author has identified seventeen texts, preserved in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Ethiopic, or Coptic, from roughly the third century B.C.E. through the early medieval period, which share one main identifying mark and a small group of overlapping family resemblances. The identifying mark is striking- ly minimal: the presence of demonstrative pronouns in a dialogue of the form, "Who are these? These are those who ..." This is the fully realized format. But even when the question is absent, and the demonstrative a mere "These . . ." (e.g., "These have committed adultery"), the distinctive genre shows itself. By this small grammatical gesture, a whole scene is set: a guide, usually angelic, is accompanying a tourist visionary as they come upon a series of groups in hell undergoing various punishments graphically de- picted. Already this test is strong enough to refute assertions of Hellenic or Roman influence on such early examples as the Apocalypse of Peter and the Apocalypse of Paul; in the Aeneid, which comes closer to the genre than earlier descriptions of Hades, the Sibyl uses the demonstrative "here .. ." which is not found in the tradition under study. 103</page><page sequence="2">104 BOOK REVIEWS The family resemblances have to do with the specific punishments asso- ciated with particular sins. These allow the author to chart in a preliminary way some separable lines of influence within what she cautiously dubs a tradition, and occasionally to make suggestions about the dating or pro- venance of previously inscrutable texts. The origin of the tradition, she suggests, is the "Book of the Watchers," chapters 1-36 of I Enoch. If, as she argues, this dates from the third century B.C.E., its concern "with the sights that the visionary sees in the course of a journey through the cosmos, rather than with collective eschatology" (p. 3), is important to speculation about the early development of the apocalyptic genre. Though a pioneering text study much involved with method and evi- dence, there is enough fire and smoke and pitch and hanging by the hair and other parts in this book to capture the imagination of a broader theological audience. Such readers might wonder why hell has so much more richly imagined and coherent a tradition than heaven.
