<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS Authors are requested to note the following before submitting manuscripts: 1. All scholarly articles directly bearing on some aspect of Judaica will be considered for publi- cation in AJSreview. Manuscripts may be sent directly to the Editor. 2. No article accepted by AJSreview may appear in any other publication, in whole or in part, in its original language or in translation, before its appearance in AJSreview. 3. Manuscripts must be submitted on regulation size (8 1/2" X 11" = 21.5 X 28 cm.) paper. Legal size (folio) paper should not be used. Xerox copy or photoreproduction of equivalent quality is acceptable. 4. ALL MATERIAL, including footnotes and indented quotes (extracts), must be typed in DOUBLE SPACE. Leave wide margins on every page. 5. A manuscript should be submitted only in its final, completed form. The cost of author's alterations made in galleys will be charged to the author. It should be remembered that a very slight change may result in the resetting of many lines of type. TYPESETTING IS COSTLY! As a matter of policy, AJSreview will not publish lists of corrections. Authors should be as conscien- tious about the format of their articles as they are about the content. No author's alterations may be made in page proofs at all. Any alterations in the original manuscript must be made by typewriter and not by hand. If a manuscript is not neatly presented, it may be returned to the author for retyping. Standard American proofreaders' marks, as found in any style manual and many dictionaries, should be used for making changes or corrections. 6. The general guide for style is A Manual of Style, 12th ed., published by the University of Chicago Press. The authority for English usage and spelling is Webster's Third International Dictionary of the English Language. While fine writing and elegance are to be prized, excessively rhetorical or exotic language detracts from the flow of an argument. Faddish or pseudotech- nical language should be avoided. While a writer should not refer to himself excessively, when he does so, the pronoun "I" should generally be used. The Editors reserve final judgment on all matters of style and usage. Manuscripts must be submitted in good, idiomatic style and in the AJSreview format. If they depart seriously from either, they may be returned to the author for revision and retyping before being sent to the readers. 7. Assemble footnotes in separate sheets at the end of the article. TYPE FOOTNOTES IN DOUBLE SPACE AND LEAVE WIDE MARGINS. Footnotes must be numbered consecutively: 1, 2, 3, 4-not 1, 2, 2a, 3 or 1, 1*, 2, 3. Please recheck manuscript to see that all footnote numbers and all foot- notes are present and correspond appropriately. 207</page><page sequence="2">208 NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS 8. Give place and date of publication (but not publisher) of all works cited except common handbooks. Full first names of authors, unless there are two initials, should be used: Andre Dupont, not A. Dupont; S. W. Baron, not S. Baron. The form of a name as listed by the Library of Congress is generally to be preferred. Place names are given in their customary English form. If a work has gone through several impressions unrevised, references should be to the date of the first impression, e.g., 1. Israel Abrahams, Hebrew Ethical Wills, 2 vols. (Philadelphia, 1926); not: (Phila- delphia, 1976). References to translated works should give the language and date of the original. 2. Leopold Zunz, Ha-Derashot be- Yisra'el (Jerusalem, 1947 from the 2d German ed. of 1892). References to articles in volumes of collected essays should indicate the original date of pub- lication of the article. The number of volumes in a multivolume work should always be indicated. Thus: 10. Cf. M. Z. Rostovtzev, Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1964), 2: 1118-21. "P." and "pp." are used when there is no preceding volume number. Thus: 12. Menahem Zulay, Zur Liturgie der babylonischen Juden (Stuttgart, 1933), p. 2. References to articles in journals must indicate the full title of the article, the name of the journal (fully spelled out), the volume number, the year of publication in parentheses followed by a colon, and inclusive page numbers. Thus: 17. See Alexander Altmann, "Maimonides' Four Perfections," Israel Oriental Studies 2 (1972): 23-24. 9. In referring to publications previously cited in a footnote, short title and not "op. cit." or "loc. cit." should be used. 10. Use Arabic numerals in all references, including volume numbers of periodicals and multi- volume works, unless there is a specific reason for using Roman numerals (as in page numbers of a preface). Dates should be written in the traditional fashion: December 12, 1956-not 12 December 1956. 11. Crossreferences to pages within an article cannot be given. One may make a crossreference to a footnote (see above, n. 23) or to a section within an article (see below, sec. 12). If an author feels he must use crossreferences, he should write his articles in numbered sections so as to make this possible. A few simple "see above" or "see below" references are acceptable as well. Please use "above" and "below" rather than "infra" and "supra." 12. Works in manuscript should be cited by library shelfmark and not by catalog number: MS Bodley Opp. Add. 4to, 38-not Neubauer 1373. The recto and verso of a folio are indicated by r and v respectively; columns by a and b: fol. 27va; fols. 16r, 17v. This does not apply to refer- ences to the Talmud or other printed Hebrew works, e.g., B.T. Shabbat 14b. 13. NOTE CAREFULLY: References to a passage extending over several pages should give the first and last page numbers. Do not use f., ff., or et seq. 14. In articles in English, words in Hebrew or other non-Latin characters should not be used unless it is essential to do so. Transliteration or translation is to be preferred. Foreign language material should be confined to footnotes. All material in the Hebrew or Roman alphabets must be typed.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS 209 15. Articles in Hebrew should follow the format of the Hebrew articles previously published in this journal. 16. The transliteration scheme for Hebrew is as given below. Dagesh bazaq is indicated by doubling the letter (except for sh and after the definite article or a preposition): ha-bishuvim ve-ha-shiqqulim ba-sefer. While it is recognized that some fields employ their own systems of transliteration with many diacritical marks, authors are kindly requested to adhere to our sys- tem whenever possible.

If the title begins with an article, capitalize the substantive as well: Ha-Yishuv ha-'ivri be-'Ere$ Yisra'el bi-tequfat ha-?albanim. Titles of works in Hebrew or Yid- dish should preferably be given in transliteration and not in English translation. 17. The Editors make every attempt to have manuscripts appraised as expeditiously as possible but no guarantee can be given concerning the amount of time required before a report can be returned to an author. AJSreview draws upon a wide, international body of manuscript appraisers who may or may not be members of the Editorial Advisory Council or, indeed, members of AJS. All manuscripts are read anonymously. The anonymity rule requires that no reader may know the name of the author of a manuscript nor may the author know the names of the readers. To ensure this, authors should avoid revealing their identity in a manuscript. Do not use such phrases as "See my article ...," "I thank my teacher, John Doe," etc. 18. Upon acceptance of their articles, contributors are requested to submit an abstract of approximately 300 words in English.</page></plain_text>
