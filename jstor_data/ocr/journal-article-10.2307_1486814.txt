Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990. x, 169 pp.; 20 plates. It is difficult to view this volume, the eighth and most recent in the series of "official" publications of the Dead Sea Scrolls and related finds, apart from the rapid succession of recent events that has resulted in access to the Scrolls being gained or at least claimed by everyone from textual researcher to tabloid reporter. However, for our purposes it is far more productive to construct an appropriate scholarly context for the proper appreciation and evaluation of the material so elegantly published and discussed here. 2. After this review was submitted to the editors, I learned of the untimely passing of Robert Cohen in 1992.</page><page sequence="2">138 BOOK REVIEWS As early as 1953 Dominique Barthl1emy presented fragments of an ancient Greek manuscript found in the Judean Desert at Nalhal Hever. In his initial publication Barthl1emy spoke of this material as "un chainon manquant de l'histoire de la Septuante." He further specified that this "missing link" was a "recension rabbinique" of the Septuagint or, we might say today, of the Old Greek. In particular, the fragments uncovered at that time and in subsequent excavations constitute part of one or more Greek manuscripts of the Minor Prophets. The first part of the volume under review is a joint effort by Emanuel Tov, Robert Kraft, and P. J. Parsons to present and account for just about every imaginable physical feature of the fragments. Treatment of the tetra- grammaton, the question of one or two scrolls, description and dating of the script-these are among the chief issues to which attention is carefully given. Not surprisingly, the question of dating is crucial. In his major publica- tion (Les devanciers d'Aquila) Barthl1emy assigned these fragments to a manuscript of the mid-first century C.E. At the time Barthl1emy wrote, in 1963, the paleographical evidence was susceptible to more than one interpretation. Even then some scholars thought the fragments had originat- ed in an earlier period, a judgment partially vindicated by Parsons, who ten- tatively opts for a date in the later first century B.C.E. This earlier dating has gained considerable acceptance among specialists. As we note below, this is an issue of more than paleographical significance. In the two sections that follow the introduction, Tov presents both a transcription of what now can be read on the leather and a reconstruction of what the ancient scribe originally wrote. In evaluating the editors' work in these sections, users of this volume are aided by the format chosen to display this all-important material: each even-numbered, or left-hand, page con- tains the unreconstructed text of a single column, with the use of all capital letters and the nonuse of word divisions, marks of punctuation, etc., repli- cating closely the present-day appearance of the manuscript; the right and facing page, containing the reconstructed text (which typically amounts to less than half of the original wording of a given column), has the full array of punctuation and accent marks that allow for a quicker reading of the Greek text. Augmented by a full discussion (found in sections D and E) of the methods employed for these reconstructions, this column-by-column pre- sentation can confidently be used as the basis for further analysis of the sort that appears in the next major section of this work. Tov devotes approximately 60 pages to section F, "Translation Techni-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 139 que, Orthographic Peculiarities, and Textual Relations." Translation techni- que is currently a "hot" topic among Septuagint scholars, and rightly so. However, for most readers of this volume, greater interest will naturally fall on questions connected with textual relations. Already Barthl1emy had spo- ken of the Greek text as a revision. To a considerable extent, Tov's detailed analysis confirms this designation. In order to do so, it was necessary to determine both the Greek text being revised and the (presumably Hebrew) text toward which revision was directed. In the case of the former, it is clear that R (the standard designation for Barth61emy-Tov's Greek text) repre- sents a revision of the LXX/Old Greek version of the Minor Prophets. As for the latter, those responsible for R clearly had as one of their major goals the "correction" of the Old Greek toward a Hebrew text similar, but not in every respect identical, to our Masoretic text. These findings, largely confirmatory in nature, raise a number of other questions that Tov has chosen not to answer here. Three are of particular interest. (1) In fashioning his reconstructions, Tov made the cautious deci- sion not to draw parallels from other Greek material, in particular the so- called kaige recension, with which R has frequently been linked. Further exploration of such links is needed. It is clear to me that what might loosely be termed a "school" was responsible for this thoroughgoing revision of the Old Greek and that broadly formulated guidelines shaped the revision, while allowing individuals a considerable degree of flexibility in dealing with separate blocks of biblical material. (2) Tov presents data that compare R with Hexaplaric sources, especially Theodotion, Aquila, and Symmachus. The significance of such comparisons, which must be looked at "qualitative- ly" and not simply quantitatively (e.g., fifty agreements between two sources when each contains a demonstratively original reading are not nearly as sig- nificant as one agreement when the reading is judged secondary; moreover, disagreements cannot be altogether ignored), awaits further analysis. In this connection, (3) we must return once more to some of Barth6- lemy's original claims. In support of his declaration that R was a rabbinic recension, Barthl1emy connected many of its (and the kaige recension's) dis- tinctive features with exegetical principles attributed in some sources to Hil- lel. In Barthelemy's view, the "author" of this Greek text was none other Jonathan ben Uzziel, who in turn is to be identified with "Theodotion" (in whose name many characteristic kaige readings were transmitted). More- over, as Barthl1emy saw it, Aquila, who made use of kaige-Theodotion-R in his own work, turns out to be an associate of Rabbi Akiba, whose exegeti-</page><page sequence="4">140 BOOK REVIEWS cal methods he exemplifies both in Greek and, as Onkelos (Aquila = Onke- los in Barthl1emy's view), in Aramaic. As I have shown elsewhere, subse- quent research on the question of links between this Greek text and specific rabbinic figures has cast serious, if not decisive, doubt on all of Bath61emy's claims in this regard.' However, it is worth noting that, to my knowledge, no talmudic scholar has entered into the discussion. Undoubtedly, such an entry would confirm much of recent research; more importantly, it would enrich our knowledge of the as yet largely untangled web that both united and differentiated first century B.C.E.-third century C.E. Jewish communi- ties, in which biblical translation, transmission, and traditions of interpreta- tion were simultaneously being developed and carried forth. A complete index of Greek words and photographs of the fragments themselves form the concluding sections of the volume. Oxford University Press, the publisher of the DJD series, began announcing the imminent appearance of this volume as early as June 1988. The actual appearance was some one and half years later. Delays of this sort and of far longer duration have been commonplace in Scrolls research. Has it been worth the wait? Perhaps, now is the time once and for all to put such questions behind us and to offer a collective thanks-to the ancient scribes who labored to produce this material, to present scholars whose labors are at last on display, and to future researchers for whom laborious efforts should yield equally rich rewards.
