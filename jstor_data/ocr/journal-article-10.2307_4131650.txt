Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004. xv, 272 pp. In this elegantly produced volume, Mark Meyerson traces the life of a single Jewish community in Spain, Morvedre (he uses the Catalan name for the Valen- cian town generally known to medievalists as Murviedro and to modem Spaniards as Sagunto), from the anti-Jewish riots of 1391 through the Spanish Jewry's expulsion in 1492. Behind this exercise in local history, however, lies a broader intention: to revise the master narrative of Hispano-Jewish historiography accord- ing to which Jewish life in Spain after 1391 was a tale of almost unmitigated woe. By demonstrating that the century between 1391 and 1492 was not simply 201</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews "a gloom-filled parenthesis" for Morvedre' s Jews but instead "an era of remarkable resurgence" (3)-nay, "a Jewish Renaissance," as the book's title provocatively proclaims-Meyerson challenges the regnant vision of Spain's Jewish commu- nities as sliding almost inexorably toward expulsion after 1391. In making his case, he weds an awareness of the historical aerial view with a fluency in older and more recent historiographic trends and an extraordinary mastery of events on the ground. The result is a copiously documented, lucidly written exploration of a treasure trove of hitherto mostly unknown archival sources that dazzles with its wealth of detail and enlivens through regular recourse to vivid vignettes. A well-wrought introduction broaches the larger issues that hover over the study, not least the "ethnic conflicts and 'cleansings' plaguing the modem world" (3). Meyerson picks up the story of Morvedre's Jews where his simul- taneously published retelling of their pre-1391 ups and downs' ends: with the devastating riots that left many Spanish Jews dead and many thousands more living as baptized Christians, or conversos. Though the initial waves of mob vio- lence and forced baptisms emanated from Castile, some Valencian Christians were also moved "to consider the possibility of using chrism and sword to effect a new socioreligious order" (23). And though Morvedre's Jews, alone among Valencia's Jewish communities, escaped the full brunt of the attacks, they found themselves inhabiting a vastly altered economic and socioreligious landscape in their wake. Chapter 1 describes these Jews as living "on the edge of desolation" after the riots. The next four chapters chart the community's recovery, evidenced by demo- graphic and economic growth and a return to relatively stable relations with the surrounding gentile world. Chapter 4, "Jews and Muslims," fills out a too-often- neglected aspect of medieval Spain's trireligious society, minority-minority relations. Chapter 5 examines the renewed sense of security and optimism about in Morvedre's Jewish quarter, reflected in intracommunal affairs. The next chapter, "Converts and Kinsfolk," one of the longest, is an engrossing study of relations between Morvedre's Jews and the conversos living in the town and in nearby Valencia city. A significant finding is that the Jews viewed aid to the conver- sos as "a positive act of faith and an affimation of Jewish identity" (185). The ties of blood and trade that bound Jews to the conversos, at once constructive and danger- ous, became far more problematic when the Spanish Inquisition set up in Valencia in 1482. While stressing the Castilian origins of this most infamous of medieval Spanish institutions (the title of chapter 7 is "Chill Wind from Castile"), Meyerson indicates that Valencia's inquisitors had the full backing of King Fernando of Aragon, who was determined to eradicate Judaizing heresy from his realm. Though too fleeting to capture its intricacies, the foregoing summary should suffice to indicate the unquestionable substantive significance of Meyerson's book. Where questions will arise, undoubtedly, is with respect to the book's con- ceptual packaging, especially in light of the rather unqualified ascription of a "Renaissance" to fifteenth-century Spanish Jewry in its title. Between the covers, Meyerson is careful to note that he does "not mean to imply that all 1. Mark D.

He also allows that terms such as "renaissance" would have had "no meaning" for Morvedre's Jews (240). And, of course, their ostensible renaissance notwithstanding, Morvedre's Jews suffered the same fate as the rest of Spanish Jewry when, in 1492, Fernando and Isabel signed an expulsion edict that, among other things, "brought 244 years of Jewish existence in Morvedre to an abrupt end" (239). Clearly, then, Meyerson is aware of objections to his conceptual framework. He also briefly takes up a possible challenge from a different angle: Does not the concept of a fifteenth-century Jewish renaissance have a prior claimant in Renaissance Italy? As Meyerson rightly observes, however, such challenges only point to questions about "the criteria by which a Jewish renaissance in this period should be evaluated" (10). His view is apparently that the fifteenth- century Jewish experience in Morvedre deserves the "renaissance" label as much as, if not more than, its Italian counterpart once attention shifts from the plane of intellectual-literary achievement to the socioeconomic sphere (10-11). This last caveat proves crucial because Meyerson grants that Valencia's Jewish population in general and Morvedre's in particular produced "very few intellectual lights and noteworthy religious leaders" (8). In effect, Meyerson takes a term usually reserved for educational, intellectual, or artistic developments and applies it to data that attest to renewed political stability, enhanced economic prosperity, and an amelioration of social circumstance. Though some may find recovery from violent riots and forced conversions a low bar for establishing a renaissance, perhaps the more interesting point to ponder is Meyerson's (gentle) polemic against what he takes to be a tendency in the Jewish studies field to judge the "well-being and achievement of a Jewish community" in terms of "the productivity and brilliance of religious scholars, philosophers, and poets" (8). As it happens, the case for Jewish renewal in fifteenth-century Spain could be bolstered by evidence drawn from the spheres of religious creativity and intellectual-literary achievement. That, however, would be the work of a different book. In the meantime, Jewish studies scholars and hispanists will undoubtedly admire the combination of solid research, judicious interpretation, and thought- provoking speculation found in this one.
