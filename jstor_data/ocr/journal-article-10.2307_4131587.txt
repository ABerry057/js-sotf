<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. Lillian Kremer. Women's Holocaust Writing: Memory and Imagination. Lin- coln: University of Nebraska Press, 1999. xi, 278 pp. Kremer's recent book is an important contribution to the growing body of scholarship devoted to literary responses to the Holocaust. Women 's Holocaust Writing joins studies such as Edward Alexander's The Resonance of Dust: Essays on Holocaust Literature, Lawrence Langer's The Holocaust and the Literary Imag- ination, Alvin Rosenfeld's A Double Dying: Reflections on Holocaust Literature, Alan Berger's Crisis and Covenant: The Holocaust in American Jewish Fiction, his more recent Children ofJob: American Second-Generation Witnesses to the Holo- caust, Sarah Horowitz's Voicing the Void, and Kremer's previous study Witness through the Imagination: Jewish-American Holocaust Literature. The construction of Kremer's study meets the challenge of two widely de- bated issues in the area of Holocaust studies. The first relates to the fact that the book focuses on women's Holocaust writing; the second that it juxtaposes Holo- caust fictional writing of women survivors with Holocaust fiction of American- born women writers. The group of 6migr6 women living in America, as Kremer calls them, include Ilona Karmel, Elzbieta Ettinger, and Hana Demetz. The native- born American writers are Susan Fomberg Schaeffer, Cynthia Ozick, Marge Pier- cy, and Norma Rosen. Aware of the continuing debate concerning the particularity of women's ex- perience, Kremer eschews fruitless and inappropriate comparisons of suffering be- tween the sexes, both of whom were targeted by the Final Solution. She explains the rationale for her exclusive focus on women writers in the fact that women's Holocaust experience was different due to their biological destiny and that their re- sponse to the Holocaust experience was different due to their patterns of social- ization. The threat of sexual abuse and the dangers involved in motherhood were hardships directed particularly at women. The networks of bonding and coopera- tion as means of protection and resistance characterize women's response. Kremer grounds her argument in works by scholars such as Sybil Milton, Joan Ringelheim and Myrna Goldberg, and then sets to prove it in the novels under her examination. Kremer's readings of the novels corroborate the findings that "[m]ale writing laments the loss of children and addresses father's grief, but does not center on ef- forts to save the children" (p. 12). Her interpretations of the novels also reflect the notion that "[n]o doubt there were men who sacrificed themselves for one anoth- 178</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews er, but the preponderance of testimony and creative writing suggests such activity was minimal compared with that reported by women" (p. 18). Kremer traces the theme of solidarity and bonding and finds that, in practically all cases, moral con- siderations have prevailed. Even in the single case of Karmel's characterization of Tola, who decides to cooperate with the Germans for her own protection, the col- laborator eventually "forsakes physical safety for spiritual survival. ... In risking her life to save another, Tola is redeemed" (p. 65). The issue of Holocaust representations in art and especially in literary writ- ing has been a longstanding debate among Holocaust scholars. Kremer places fic- tion grounded in the memory of the writer-survivor alongside works of fiction en- gendered in the imagination of American-born writers. The inclusion of the latter communicates the legitimacy of fictional representations of the Holocaust. The juxtaposition of literature of memory with literature of imagination places the out- sider's fiction in the same rank as the survivor's. Kremer tells us that the intention of this construction was to extend the canon of literary study by including women's fiction. She is, however, aware of the inherent difference between the two bodies of fiction that she chose to examine, and pays close attention to the resources and the strategies the writers used in telling the story. The fiction of the 6migr6 women is invariably grounded in their personal experiences. Thus, Karmel focuses on her Krakow ghetto experience and memories of the labor camps in which she was im- prisoned. Ettinger draws upon her experiences in the Warsaw ghetto, and upon her activities as a resistance fighter in Aryan Poland (of special interest is the account of her protagonist's return to post-WW II Poland and her consequent disillusion with the communist regime there). Demetz represents a particular case of a child of "mixed race" in the reality of the Holocaust, an experience central to her nov- el. The fiction of the American-born women writers grounds itself in secondary sources. Thus, Schaeffer's Anya is based on interviews with survivors; Piercy's Gone with the Soldiers demonstrates thorough research and personal contacts with survivors. Ozick and Norma also draw upon contact with survivors as well as re- search of the Holocaust post-traumatic effects. Kremer also tries to establish a thematic differentiation between the two bod- ies of writing. She claims that the American writers avoid as much as possible rep- resentations of ghettos and camps, that they refrain from criticizing the victims and their moral decisions, and that they focus on individual survival and the post-war social reintegration of the victim. These suppositions are not quite borne out in the fiction itself. Suffice it to mention Ozick's imaginary reproduction of the concen- tration camp and the murder of the child in "The Shawl," and the critical repre- sentation of the child's mother, Rosa, the Holocaust survivor, in the sequel named "Rosa." Here an essential differentiation between survivors and observers comes to the fore, exhibiting the Americans' limited comprehension of prewar Europe. This lack of understanding accounts for the inclination to judge pre-Holocaust Eu- ropean Jewry from the American post-Holocaust perspective, a perspective which categorically sees Jewish identification as the only possible response to the Holo- caust. It seems to me that a more plausible interconnection between the two bod- ies of fiction lies in Norma Rosen's argument that the enormity of the Holocaust, "the malaise, the malediction of [Holocaust] knowledge has entered the psyche of 179</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review Jew and non-Jew alike" (p. 213), thus justifying preoccupation with the event and its aftermath and opening a variety of possible responses. Kremer presents a detailed and thorough, thematically arranged summary of each novel. She locates her discussion in the socio-historical context of the writer's biography and often verifies the fiction with historical factuality. As she herself admits, the intention of the study is "to unite literary explication with sociopoliti- cal constructs, to show how the writers negotiated the complicated interaction among life story, history, and fiction" (p. xi). All in all, Kremer has delivered her promise: She has expanded the canon drawing our attention to important literary women's representations of the Holocaust. I would suggest, however, that a dis- cussion of the survivors' writing in second-language English would have been of particular interest here. After all, writing in English as an 6migr6 in a new country implies an intended readership quite unknown to the writer. This crucial decision certainly deserves an in-depth consideration.
