TA'ANITH: SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT Mythic Hydrology in the Babylonian Talmud and in Ancient Iran by Reuven Kiperwasser and Dan D. Y. Shapira In this paper we shall study an aggadic tradition from the Babylonian Talmud while trying to find traces of early Iranian mythological conceptions that were absorbed by the talmudic sages as a part of their own biblically enrooted knowledge. We shall also attempt to gain a better understanding of the talmudic text by presuming that it reflects ideas absorbed from the Iranian?or, rather, "Iraqian"?environment.1 Occasionally, however, early Iranian myths do not always survive in their original, complete forms, and sometimes only fragmentary remains in medieval Zoroastrian literature can be used for their reconstruction. The It is our pleasant duty to express our gratitude to those whose criticism, encouragement, com ments, and corrections contributed to the development of this paper: Professor Yaakov Elman, Pro fessor Michael Sokoloff, Professor James R. Russell, Dr. Shai Secunda, Dr. Geoffrey Herman, Dr. Pavel Lurie, Dr. David Buyaner, Dr. Ronit Nikolsky, and Mr. Samuel Thrope. We are highly obliged to the anonymous reader whose suggestions helped us in making our argument sharper. 1. The bibliography on relationships between the culture of Ancient Iran and Judaism is rich. See, e.g., E. Stave, Einfluss des Parsismus auf das Judentum (Haarlem: Bohn, 1898); A. Kohut, ?ber die j?dische Angelologie und D?monologie in Ihrer Abhaengigkeit von Parsismus (Leipzig: Broc khaus, 1866); and idem, "Parsic and Jewish Legends of the First Man," Jewish Quarterly Review 3 (1891): 231-50. The skeptical approach expressed by J. Neusner, Judaism and Zoroastrianism at the Dusk of Late Antiquity: How Two Ancient Faiths Wrote Down Their Great Traditions (Atlanta: Scholars' Press, 1993), prevailed for a long time, but new interest was eventually roused by Y. Elman, "Acculturation to Elite Persian Norms and Modes of Thought in the Babylonian Jewish Community of Late Antiquity," in Netiot le-David. Jubilee Volume for David Weiss Halivni, ed. Y. Elman, E.

Y. Shapira so-called ninth-century books2 in Pahlavi were edited by Zoroastrian priests at a rather late date, and in a quite tendentious manner. Significantly, the bulk of the numerous "pagan" strains were excised, probably because the editing work took place in a Muslim environment, and our knowledge of the actual popular religions of Sasanian?or, for our purpose, talmudic?western Iran and Mesopotamia/Iraq is far from adequate. Thus, every piece of secondary evidence regarding the popular Iranian beliefs is precious.3 As is self-evident, the Babylonian Talmud, this encyclopedic literary endea vor, includes remnants of literary genres and traditions of Jewish Babylonian authors, and, as such, this work can testify to the range of ideas that were current in its cultural environment. We do not claim that the Jewish Babylonian sages were familiar with the literary sources of the ancient Iranian religion or that the Iranian mythology was known to them from the written teachings of the Iranian Zo roastrian priests. It is clear that the Jewish Babylonian sages did not know the written texts of Zoroastrianism, neither ancient nor contemporary. It is also evident that the interaction was mostly oral, with written texts (such as magical texts) playing only a secondary role in the mutual transfer of (sometimes blurred) religious conceptions of the other. Yet on this popular level of interaction, Babylo nian rabbinic thought did not reject out of hand any mythic notion, and, on the level of popular religion, the rabbis demonstrated a strong tendency toward syncretism and harmonization. Talmudic authors blended ideas and divine figures, as well as mythological motifs from various religious traditions, in order to harmonize the different parts of the assemblage.4 We will attempt to exemplify this process with the talmudic tale about the mythological creature Ridy?. 2.

The element of rep etition evident in the structure of this sentence, used for reinforcement and emphasis, is obviously reminiscent of a common Jewish oath formula, the aim of which is to approve and to reinforce what will be said subsequently. Seventeen of the ^ nn ""Tib narratives in the Babylonian Talmud5 are attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, who is the hero of these stories;6 ten are found in Bava' Batra' 73a-74b and seven in other talmudic treatises.7 In this group of tales, the Aramaic expression ^ nn "'Tf? indicates that the content is hyperbolic. Rabbah bar Bar Hannah introduces himself as a witness who has traveled to places connected to the ancient biblical past or to some mythological or magic loci or entities. A number of mythological beasts appear in the stories in Bava' Batra', most of them taken directly from Iranian mythologies?the Bascuc,8 the Serpent, the Frog, the giant Kar[a]-Fish, and the giant newborn Aurochs?while others show some Iranian cultural influence (Hormiz/n bar Lili?th?).9 Similar in character are the ^ nn ^Vlb stories attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah that appear in other Babylonian Talmud treatises: "the milk and honey of the Land of Israel," an idiomatic expression for the most fruitful place in the Land of Israel, whose size is tremendous,10 Jonah's Ricinus (castor-berry 5.

This sage, of Babylonian origin, spent some time in Palestine; he is generally regarded to be a third-generation Amora. In Palestinian rabbinic sources he is named "R. Abba bar Bar Hannah." It is only in the Babylonian Talmud that he is the hero of travelogues and a fantastic storyteller. See Ch. Albeck, Mavo Latalmudim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1987), 305; G.

Shapira shrub),11 the Israelite camp in the wilderness,12 the Arab tribesman performing magic tricks,13 and two stories about different mythological beasts: the giant newborn Aurochs14 and the creature named Ridy?, which will be discussed later. The raison d'etre of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah's tales, as well as of some other *) nn ^vi1? stories of different attribution,15 is to promote the acceptance of information deemed highly unusual,16 and the use of this phrase is intended to confirm the story's veracity. The common denominator of the stories is the need for approval of the content, out of the concern that they will not be received by the audience as genuine, albeit rather uncommon.17 The tales attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah in Bava' Barra' explore, at the most fundamental level, the complicated relationship between two civiliza tions: that of the Babylonian rabbis and that of western Iranians and Iraqian Ara maeans as it was understood by the former. The tales can be seen as "narratives in dialogue"18?that is, they explore the process by which the rabbinic culture incor porated the values of the other. Knowing, from a variety of talmudic sources, of Rabbah bar Bar Hannah's familiarity with Iranian lore, it is not surprising to encounter, in one of the stories attributed to him and beginning with the formula ^ nn ^vf?, another beast named Ridy? (B. Ta'anith 25b); this creature is said to have played some role in the mythic hydrology. The particular story is traditionally understood in the following way:19 11. B. Shabbat21a. 12. See B. 'Eruvin 55b; B. Yoma 75b; B. Gittin 4a. 13. SeeB. Yevamot 120b. 14. See B. Zevahim 113b = Bava' Batra' 73a. 15. See B. Sanh?drin 97b; Megillah 6a. 16. Most likely, not every ,l? nn tY? included fantastic content; there are stories with uncertain hyperbolic mechanisms, such as the story about one Bedouin's immense defecation (see B. Shabbat 82a, 155b). 17. In the description of the places connected with the ancient biblical past (B. Pesahim 93b; Gittin 57a) and the Tiberian Sea (B. Mo'ed Katan 18b; Bava' Kamrna' 58b), and in the story about dream interpretations affirmed by oath (Berakhot 46a), the context seems hyperbolic. Sometimes the expression appears in a context that the narrator himself viewed as esoteric, such as the legendary and uncertain "Adam's book" (B. Bava' Mezi'a' 85b) and the pinacs (waxed tables) of Balaam (Sanh? drin 106b). On the latter, see E. E. Urbach, "The Rabbinic Sermons about the Gentile Prophets and the Story of Balaam," in The World of the Sages (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2002), 537-55; J. R.

Said Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, I saw that Ridy?; he resembles a heifer of three years old, his lip is split and he is stationed between the upper and the lower deep, to the upper deep he says: "Pour down your water," and to the lower deep: "Let your water spring up," as it is said [Song of Songs 2:12]: "The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing is come, and the voice of the turtle[dove] is heard in our land." Both the content and the language of the story are difficult and raise the following problems: First, how is this Ridy? similar to a three-year-old heifer if, judging from the context, it should be an enormously big creature? And second, what is its func tion in the dialogue between the two abysses? Hydrology First we should explain the hydrologie mechanism of the scene. Already in the biblical cosmology we encounter, at the beginning of Genesis 1, the three-level structure of the world: heaven, earth, and the lower level of the world, with the primeval waters separated into two?one upper reservoir of water above the heavens, and a lower one under the heavens.20 The term for the lower level is mnn/mftinn, "depth, abyss," which is connected, in many ways, with the production of rain.21 This "treasure" of the rain is situated in the upper level of the world, namely, in heaven.22 In the Second Temple period, this place was con sidered to be visited and seen only by a chosen few.23 Therefore, Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, despite his not having gone to see the heavens, as other visionaries did, appears simply as an informant about the source of the rain; his role as mere witness can be seen in the depictions of his other voyages.24 The rabbinic literature tells of an upper abyss that is full with water and a lower abyss that contains the primeval water. The rainwater is poured down on the earth through channels25 as a result of the interaction between the abysses, as is described in a tannaitic tradition: pi DTO? uros nefriD y-ixn tot rfry^a tito nsui nou bi -f? *pN nry*? p tw&amp;w '1 'm 'in ?mp mnn *?k nnnn 'oik xin 20.

Simeon ben Eleazar: There is not a handbreadth [of rain] that falls from above of which the earth does not emit two handbreadths on its account. And so it says [Psalms 42:8]: "Abyss calls unto abyss [at the voice of Your channels]."26 This is an example of equal synchronie interaction between the upper and the lower partner. Another opinion claims that the rain does not come from the upper waters but from the lower ones, going from the lower abyss to the sea (ocean), from which it rises, by clouds, to the heavens, where it turns into rain: ?arai na... pKn p x*?x irrnn px a^awn p inrTW ^yox .pxn p x*?x irrin px pxm a^awn ww na ^ -p .. .What is [the nature of] the rain? Though the rain falls from heaven, its creation is from the earth. Thus all that is in heaven and on earth was created from the earth alone.27 But in the Babylonian Talmud, we find some indication that the rain comes directly from the upper abyss: . pittm wnm uaaw y^pnn w nmp ras There is something like a box in the firmament from which the rains issue.28 According to a different model, clouds come to the source of the upper water, take it, and bring it to the earth in the form of rain.29 Despite the differences, it seems that both the Palestinian and the Babylonian sages agree in their usage of the fol lowing tannaitic tradition, which is probably based on the earliest rainmaking model. The interpretation of this tannaitic model by the Palestinian sage R. Levi is quite common in the entire rabbinic literature: ,n"ri3?

We can probably see a similar notion in another Babylonian Talmud Aggadah in which the men of the generation of the Tower of Babel {dor happallagah) want to build their edifice in order to reach this "treasure" and have free access to its contents at any time (B. Sanh? drin 109a). 29. B. Ta'anith 9b. 106</page><page sequence="7">Irano-Talmudica I channels]" [Psalms 42:8]. R. Levi said: The upper waters are male while the lower are female, and they say one to the other: "Receive us; You are the crea tures of the Holy One, blessed be He, whilst we are His messengers." Immedi ately they receive them; thus it is written, "[Let the sky pour down righteousness;] let the earth open" [Isaiah 45:8]?like a female who opens to the male.30 It seems that, according to this sage's interpretation of the dialogue between the abysses in Psalms 42:8, the upper waters take part in the production of rain. They call upon the waters in the lower abysses to be ready to receive them. The upper waters make rain, and the lower waters prepare the earth to receive the rain. According to this mythic conception, the mechanism of rain production is like intimacy between a man and a woman,31 and therefore the hydrographie process, according to the Palestinian sages, is a kind of direct interaction between the two abysses. Though we are aware of rabbinic tolerance in the area of theological and quasi-"scientific" (in the sense of "wisdom") speculation, including the rabbis' acceptance of differing conceptions, it nonetheless is not sur prising that there is some opposition. We are mostly interested in the rabbinic tra ditions relating to the following Babylonian Talmud passage. Here, the redactor brings together two aggadic traditions about the nature of the rainmaking: one according to the Palestinian sages, quoted earlier, and the next from the Babylo nian sage Rabbah bar Bar Hannah:32 :"i?ix "iTjftx p iraw "on ,x^n .dtis? ntzftw irm-ip5? xxv mnn yxw ,7bmfrn n?u *f? yx ?ro man nx tooled ?-inftN ^m ion... nTarr? i mnn '"ui "pus Vip1? imp mnn *?x mnn -i?xuw ,ymw ^x myn w Vip ,ywn ynx .(n na m^nn) It was taught [in a baraita]: R. Simeon ben Eleazar said: Not a handbreadth of rain comes from above, but that the abyss below comes up to meet it three handbreadths [...]. R. Eleazar said: When the libation is offered during the Feast [of Sukkoth], one abyss says to the other: "Let your water spring forth, I hear the voice of two friends."33 For it is said: "Abyss calls unto abyss [at the voice of Your channels]." Compare the text cited on the following page: 30. Bereshit Rabba 13:14 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 122). The parallels are P. Ta'anit 1:3 64b (Academy of Hebrew Language ed. [Jerusalem, 2001], 707); Bereshit Rabba 13 (ed. Theodor Albeck, pp. 122-23), Midrash Shemuel 9:3-4 (ed. Buber, p. 74); Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 5; and Midrash Tehillim 42:5 (ed.

This exposition is also linked to the interpretations of Psalms 42. Thus, during the Sukkoth celebration, we have a dialogue between the abysses in which the upper one says to the lower one, "Let your water spring forth." This tradition, Palestinian in origin but mentioned by the Babylonian sages, comes from the same back ground as R. Levi's homily, and it is based on the concept that rainmaking is the direct interaction between the two partners, without any mediator. The redactor then cites another alternative model of rainmaking, which is the Rabbah bar Bar Hannah story about Ridy? and the abysses.34 This tradition is a reworked version of the Palestinian tradition regarding the conversation between the two abysses. In the Babylonian version there is no dialogue; rather, the mediator asks the lower abyss to emit its/her water and the upper one to pour down its water. This redaction of the dialogue tradition employs a new exegetical method, for the exegete probably intends to say that there is only one voice talking to both abysses, and that is precisely why he refers to the verse from Song of Songs, in which only one voice is mentioned. It is implied that this voice of rain is tremendously strong, but, by divine wisdom, humans do not hear it. Because this notion is presented both in the Palestinian and in the Babylonian sources, it is therefore interesting that the Palestinian sages discussed the topic of the voice of the rain, yet they do not give it a name: avn in frxi pyaiw irx mnnm idid iyi a^iyn nioa *f?m f?ip anm ': ^b 'i lax .nxxTW nywn tram n^mm R. Levi said: The voice of three things travels from one end of the world to the other, yet no creature hears it, namely, the day [i.e., the sun], the rain, and the soul when it departs.35 But the Babylonian Talmud, in a similar context, specifies the voice of Ridy?: bv nnan *?ipi ,nan bi?n Vip :p i*?xi ,idid "ryi a^iyn nioa pnVin nf?ip vfrw :pni un .x"Tn HN :anaix w ?nv1? *)$ :anaix un .ryun p hxsto nywn naw3 Vipi ^ain Our Rabbis taught: There are three voices going from one end of the world to the other: the voice of the wheel of the sun, the voice of the tumult of Rome, and the voice of the soul as it leaves the body.

Yoma' 20b. 108</page><page sequence="9">Irano-Talmudica I Therefore, the Babylonian sages revised the Palestinian conception known to them about the direct interaction between the abysses and transformed it into a model of a meditated relationship. Now we should ask why Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, who is known for his acquaintance with the Iranian mythological bestiary, needed to introduce a mediator into the dialogue between the two abysses? It seems that the answer is to be found in the Iranian lore. The Iranian Mythological Text Chapter 24 of the Middle Persian Zoroastrian composition Bundahisn31 which draws on older sources of the late Sasanian period, contains short descriptions of fab ulous creatures, practically all of them having their exact parallels38 in the Rabbah bar Bar Hannah stories in B. Bava' Batra'. These similarities are quite telling. They imply that these stories were incorporated by the Jewish sources en bloc from the Zoroas trian milieu. The mythological creatures featured in Bundahisn 24 include the Three Legged Ass (xar F se pay), in a context that is quite aquatic.39 This Ass, as big as 37. This composition exists in two versions: the Indian one, which is abridged but became known at an earlier date and influenced the writings of Jewish scholars in the nineteenth century: F.

To be dealt with in R. Kiperwasser and D. D. Y. Shapira, Rabbah bar Bar Hannah, a Jewish Traveler from Sasanian Babylonia (work in progress). The following is merely a concise summary: The first story in Bava' Barra' is about Hurmiz, son of Liliy?th?, who runs, devilishly, on the wall of the city and causes storms on the sea by his magical pouring of water from one bowl (m?dag &gt; ?uto) to another. The second story is about the immensely big newborn Aurochs (nw "a iram xVmx), who blocks the Jordan with his droppings. The third tale is about the giant Frog (xnpilpK) as big as the dicpa of Hagronia (Agranum). Notwithstanding its size, the Frog can be eaten by a tannin, who can be eaten by a mythical bird Bascuc (xxpws); this bird sits on a tree whose giant size can be seen from the sizes of the Frog, the tannin, and the bird. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stories are about the giant fish Kara (nthd), who can be eaten by sixty towns, from whose bones booths can be built, and whose back is big enough for sailors to make a fire there and cook their food. The seventh story is about a giant bird who stands within the turbulent sea and whose head reaches the firmament. The order of appearance of the corresponding creatures in Bundahisn 24, after references to ?hrmazd and Ahriman, is as follows: a devilish Ahriman-shaped giant Frog who might damage the Haoma; two ?hrmazd-created giant Kar[a]-Fish, who are constantly going around this Frog to prevent it from harming the Haoma and who also eat men?g; the Tree of Many Seeds that grows in the middle of the sea of Fraxvkard and contains all the seeds of all the plants; the Three-Legged Ass; the Ox H?dhayans (G?w ? H?dhayans), who is also called Sris?k; the bird Camr?s, who picks people from all the non-Iranian lands as a bird (picks) grain, and Karsift, who recites the Avesta in the language of birds; the aquatic Bull, who makes sounds, all the fish become pregnant, and all the pregnant noxious creatures cast their young; the mythic birds Simurgh (S?nmurw), Baskuc, and As?zust, whom they called Z?rbarag, and others. 39. This Three-Legged Ass is also mentioned in the Indian Bundahisn, trans. West, Sacred Books of the East, vol., V, chap. XIX, pp. 1-12, 67-69; in D?dest?n ? M?n?g ? Xrad, trans. West, 109</page><page sequence="10">Reuven Kiperwasser and Dan D. Y Shapira Mt. Xvanwand, is described as having three legs, six eyes, one horn, and nine testi cles. The Ass is mentioned immediately after the text explains how waters flow in the world through subterranean channels in order to satiate the benevolent creatures. The structure is as follows: (1) The Tree of Many Seeds {Van ?was-tohmag) grows in the middle of the cosmic sea of Fraxvkard; all the seeds of all the plants are inside this World-Tree. In the trunk of the World-Tree nine mountains have been formed, holed by 9,999 myriad streams; (2) the reservoir of the World Waters has been created in these mountains; (3) through these streams the water goes forth from this reservoir, under the earth, to all the seven climes of the earth, and the sources of all the waters of the lakes?and, apparently, the springs of the whole world?come from it. It is on this stage that the Three-Legged Ass is introduced, standing in the midst of the Sea of Fraxvkard, apparently close to the World-Tree. This righteous (ahlaw) Ass is said to have a bluish-greenish (xas?n)40 head and a shining white (sped) body, and his food is said to be "spiritual" (m?n?g-xvarisn).41 With his six eyes he overcomes and smites the worst dangers and troublesome harm; with his horn he strikes and overcomes all the worst troubles. He moves the waters of the cosmic sea by holding his neck in the sea and bending his ears down. The voice of his braying makes pregnant all the benevolent aquatic female creatures of ?hrmazd, while the pregnant among all the malevolent aquatic noxious creatures of Ahriman abort their fetuses. This Ass purifies all the waters of the seas, in all the seven climes of the earth, by urinating into the cosmic sea; this is why all worldly asses urinate into water when they see it. The Bundahisn chapter also quotes a lost Avestan passage in a Pahlavi translation: If the Three-Legged Ass had not given purification to the water, all the waters would have been destroyed and the defilement of the Stinking Ghost would have been brought upon the water, to the death of all the creation of ?hrmazd. And immediately we are told in the Pahlavi source that the star Tistr/Sirius takes the water from the cosmic sea with the assistance of the Three-Legged Ass.42 Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XVIII, chap.

The Young Avestan Yasna 42?apparently, the remote source of our Pahlavi passage in Bundahisn 24?makes a reference to the righteous Ass who stands in the middle of the sea Vouru-kasa, whose Middle Persian form is Fraxvkard (xarsmc? yim asauuansm yazamaid? y? histait? maidim zra?anhno vouruhasah?), while the whole context of this short Yasna is aquatic. The Yasna reads, 1. We worship You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! the entire collection of this Yasna, Haptanghaiti (as we sum up all). And we honor the fountains of the waters, and the fordings of the rivers, the forkings of the high ways, and the meetings of the roads. 2. And we honor the hills that run with torrents, and the lakes that brim with waters! and the corn that fills the cornfields; and we honor both the protector and the Creator, both Zarathustra and the Lord. 3. And we honor both earth and heaven, and the stormy wind that Mazda made, and the peak of high Haraiti, and the land, and all things good. 4. And we honor the Good Mind (in the living) and the spirits of the saints. And we honor the fish of fifty-fins, and the righteous Ass, who stands in the middle of the Sea Vouru-kasa, and we honor that sea of Vouru-kasa where he stands, 5. And the Haoma, golden-flowered, growing on the heights; yea, the Haoma that restores us, and aids this world's advance. We honor Haoma that drives death afar, 6. And the flood-streams of the waters, and the great flights of the birds, and the approaches of the Fire-priests, as they approach us from afar, and seek to gain the provinces, and spread the ritual lore. And we honor the Bountiful Immortals all! Ridy? s Name and Function The Three-Legged Ass of Bundahisn 24, one of whose roles is to be a mediator in mythological hydrologie processes, is all too similar to this obscure calf-like creature, the Ridy? of B. Ta'anith, who mediates between the abysses and therefore has an active role in the hydrologie processes. Most of what is said about the Three-Legged Ass corresponds closely to the functions and charac teristics of the "threefold heifer," such as drawing the subterranean waters by his voice, while he says to the ntfrin Xftinn (the lower abyss) to make its water flow forth (ywft ynx); the imperative ywn iltf/n (pour your waters down) in our Ta'anith passage is, of course, functionally parallel to the urination of the Ass into the waters (by which he purified all the waters of the seas, in all the seven Orientale Roma, vol. LXVIII, no. 2 (Rome 1995), 100 (with references to our Pahlavi and Avestan pas sages); and P. Gignoux, "Le m?canisme de la pluie entre le mythe et l'exp?rimentation (D?dest?n ? d?n?g 92)," Iranica Antiqua 23 (1988): 385-90. Ill</page><page sequence="12">Reuven Kiperwasser and Dan D. Y. Shapira climes of the earth). The mention of the voice(s) of the channels as a means of communication between the abysses ("pus ^ip1? mnn *?N mnn) is a fascinating example of the harmonization of inherited hydrologie perceptions with borrowed notions, namely, those about the channels through which the water goes forth, from the subterranean reservoirs, to all the seven climes of the earth, feeding the sources of all the waters of the lakes. Again, the voice of the "threefold heifer" finds its exact parallel in the voice of the braying Three-Legged Ass, the voice that impregnates all the benevolent aquatic female creatures.43 The case of this Ass-turned-heifer highlights the depth of the Iranian-Jewish interaction in Sasanian Babylonia. In our case, this is not merely an instance of the borrowing of a mythological character from Iranian lore and its insertion into the Jewish tradition; rather, we have here an illuminating example of the mechanisms of absorption and reworking of Iranian concepts, with names and functions adapted to the existing Jewish ones. Earlier Jewish scholars, however, working with inadequate texts of Ta'anith and the Bundahisn, did not see this possible explanation. Thus, for example, A. Kohut44 identified Ridy? with Ardvi, that is, with Ardvi-Sura-Anahita,45 a com posite female deity related to water in the Iranian tradition.46 Not only do the epithets (Ardvi/'Ridy?) not have much in common phonetically, there are practi cally no common features?except water?between the myths in which Ardvi Sura-Anahita appears and our Ta'anith passage. Nevertheless, Kohut correctly observed that the verse from Song of Songs (2:12), uxixa J/atZft mnn Vip, was crucial for the absorption of the Iranian myth into a Jewish setting. The entire verse reads, un?a mwn mnn Vipi snn "ram ny pxn ix-n mmn, "the blossoms have appeared in the land, the time of pruning has come; and the voice of the tur tledove is heard in our land," and our Ta'anith passage does, in fact, refer to the beginning of this verse. Kohut, however, observed that the Aramaic tor was under stood as identical to the Hebrew s?r, "bull."47 This is how this v?w, closely synonymous with s?r I tor, could have first entered our Ta'anith passage, for Vip "fl2niQ tffctw linn was explained as the voice of a bovine has been heard inside our earth. But Kohut's reference to the targum to Proverbs 5:16, ~pntt tr*?roi 43. We will refer later to a context in which the voice of our talmudic creature and childbirth appear together. 44. See Nathan ben Jehiel, Aruch hashalem, ed. A. Kohut (Vienna: 1878-1882 [1969]), 257; and Kohut, ?ber die j?dische Angelologie, 43 ff. 45. On this female deity, see M. Boyce, "The Lady and the Scribe: Some Further Reflections on An?h?t and T?r," in A Green Leaf: Papers in Honour of Professor Jes P. Asmussen {Hommages et Opera Minora), ed. J. Duchesne-Guillemin, W. Sundermann, and F. Vahman (Leiden: Brill, 1988), 277-82. 46. Some Iranists (and following them, R. Adin Steinsaltz [Even-Israel]) have suggested deri vation from the Persian dary?, "sea"; indeed, the sea does feature in the Iranian background of the story. 47. Indeed, the Aramaic etymon of the Hebrew for "bull," s?r, is tor; however, the Hebrew tor in Song of Songs has no bovine sense and means merely "turtle" (a species of dove). We should mention also I. H. Schorr, "Hattoroth," He-Haluz 7 (1865): 16, who speculated about Ridy? as tor ("bull" in Aramaic) &lt; T?r (because of the phonetic similarity), which he identified with the Iranian deity Tistrya (who, in fact, is mentioned together with the Three-Legged Ass in Bundahisn 24; see above). On the relationship between Tistrya and T?r, see, however, Panaino, Tistrya, part II, 61-86. 112</page><page sequence="13">Irano-Talmudica I "P?o, namely, "|Tn p irm, is irrelevant here: Rady? does indeed mean "running water," yet Kohut was misled by quoting Rashi (Niniz; izmn mwn fitz/1? arm icipjw mn tf? ttnnn N*7 'nm ito1? nan). Rashi, in fact, confused two different Aramaic roots, and he used our Ta'anith passage and a quote from Deuteronomy 22:10 to explain the passage in Proverbs. Such circular reasoning cannot be brought as a proof of the original meaning of our ridy?. In fact, two Aramaic roots do exist, RDY I, "to subjugate to the ground/to plow," and RDY II, "to drive" (especially waters), "to flow"; RDA, "to travel, move along, go on, continue, live, flow, emanate."48 The fact, however, that the narrator employed the Aramaic word, using a purely Aramaic word(s) with the meanings of "running water channels," and even "bovine," leads us to suspect this is a disguised refer ence to an Iranian epithet of the Three-Legged Ass.49 The enigmatic appellation of our Babylonian Talmud, N^ry, namely /Nn^in Krf?n, should be taken as a distorted reflection of another epithet of this Ass, the "three-legged one," which, in fact, appears in Bundahisn. It may be further suggested that the transformation of the Ass into a heifer was prompted by the interference of similar-sounding Aramaic words (with meanings like "ox," "running water," "to flow") with mbn I xnVin tors?, "the threefold heifer," which was probably derived from a targum of Genesis 15:9, ntZ^W? rto, generally taken to mean "a three-year-old she-calf." The geonim explained the latter as meaning "the third-born calf," xn^in tf?w wm '1 p.50 Thus, in the second stage, the postulated Iranian epithet was reinterpreted as an Aramaic 48. In Jewish Eastern Aramaic one finds RDYA, "plower"; "plowing, plowing season"; "name of the angel of rain," quoting our passage in Ta'anith and Yoma' 21a, top; rady?, "running water" (M. Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Bavli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature [New York: Putnam's, 1903], 1452a); "plowing" and even "ox," as can be seen from the passages quoted (M. Sokoloff, A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods [Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2002], 1060a); in Mandaic, the Aramaic dialect most closely related to that of the Babylonian Talmud, one finds Rida and Ridya (root RDA), "affliction, chastisement"; RDA 1: "to travel on, flow, flow a course, to impel"; RDA 2: "to cut, plough" (E. S. Drower and R. Macuch, A Mandaic Dictionary [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963], 432, 425). Cf. Syriac for "flowing waters": r?d?y?lr?dw?yt?, "fluid, liquid; aqua fluens"; redy?, "flow, current, running water, a stream; flux, march" (C. Brock elmann, Lexicon Syriacum [Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard; Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1895 (1995)], 714). 49. In a highly speculative vein, one may be led to think that at the first stage of adaptation of the Iranian material, the word KTH could have been derived from the Iranian words for "flowing water" (r?z?; Parthian r?zisn), for this function is the principal one?in fact, the only one?of the Zoroastrian Three-Legged Ass. In this case, one should suggest that this Ass was known among some western Iranians by this reconstructed?or similar?epithet. The derivation from a Persian word for "defecation" (r?dan/r?y/n-), used as a substitute for the word for urination, looks improbable, although the Three-Legged Ass's defecation is mentioned in our Pahlavi text, together with his urination, as the source of ambergris ("and it is revealed about ambergris that it is the dung of the Three-Legged Ass, for even it is mostly a spiritually-eating [creature], still, the moisture and nutrition of the water enters its body through pores and it casts them away as urine and dung"). 50.

Shapira word; in the third stage, the reading of biblical allusions into the talmudic text led to the introduction of minor changes into the borrowed Iranian imagery so that it would correspond with the inherited Palestinian scheme. We need to return to the textual problems of the talmudic passage. Synopsis The textual traditions of B. Ta'anith have not been studied sufficiently. The relationships between the manuscripts have not been subjected to a comprehensive analysis, and we do not know which of the textual versions is closer to the original version of B. Ta'anith. We cannot trace the relationship between the various witnesses to the textual tradition of the whole work, but we should?and could?search for the more original version of the narrative tradition of our fragment. Now we move on to our analysis of the passage in question, focusing on the different readings important for our discussion while ignoring the obvious errors in the versions, which are typical for the textual transmission of the rabbinic literature.51 The known version, as it was accepted by the medieval Talmud scholars, is as follows: xn*?n xbatf? ^77 xm "wn ,l? nn tt"? run 12 12 7121 'ax Rabbah bar Bar Hannah said: "I saw that Ridy?; he resembles a heifer three years old."

Because the version "a heifer three years old" seemed incoherent and illogical, Rashi felt pressed to correct it. We should, nevertheless, suggest another explanation, preferring the more developed textual version but with a well-grounded correction. First of all, we prefer the version of O, especially in the reading wi xnn, which agrees with the parallel readings of VI34 and L. Therefore, Rabbah bar Bar Hannah said that he saw R?dya de-Mayy?, "the Lord of the Water," or R?d? de Mayy?, "the Pourer [Persian r?z-7] of the Water." Now we have no need for any resemblance to Ridy?. Preferring the version of O,53 we may attempt an expla nation of nxrr^n ^aXT x^py1?. The word ^axi has no consistent meaning here, and the exact meaning of nxrrtn x^ry1? is difficult. We are forced to say that this version is a copyist's error and, as such, needed to be corrected in a reasonable way. One may ponder whether ^axi could be a misreading of D^p, with X^py*? being another misreading or a hypercorrection (as the change ,,y/y&lt;n is possible from the graphic aspect, and, probably, the medieval copyist had difficulty under standing the meaning of this hypothetical expression nxrrtn X^pn5?, "of three legs"), but both suggestions are highly speculative. Rather, remembering the Iranian Three-Legged Ass and its role in mythological hydrology, we may prob ably hypothesize that the talmudic traveler Rabbah bar Bar Hannah declared that "I saw that Ridy? of the Water, he stands on three legs." Consequently, the recon structed version, nxir^n x^p-i1? n^xp xw xnn nn, was misunderstood and changed to an expression that could be understood in another context (see above) but is totally unsuitable here. 53.

Y Shapira But why does the storyteller need the Iranian Three-Legged Ass as a mediator in the relationship between the mythological abysses? The Palestinian model of rainmaking as a direct interaction between the abysses was based on the Bible and further developed in the Second Temple and Palestinian rabbinic lit erature. The Iranian hydrologie model is mediated by special mythic creatures, such as the Three-Legged Ass or Tistrya. The model attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah not only introduces the mediator, it also harmonizes two different hydrologie models. It is known from other stories in Bava' Batra' attributed to Rabbah bar Bar Hannah that this storyteller had a strong inclination to cultural naturalization, using mythic elements from the Iranian heritage and building from them new cultural patterns. This was part of the process of incorporating the values of the Iranian Other by Babylonian rabbinic culture; however, it did use the seemingly exotic dimensions of the other culture in building the framework of its own.54 The Palestinian hydrologie model was brought to a new cultural environment, in which it was reworked and adapted to the rabbinic context.
