If we translate the imagined statement attributed to God into the type of</page><page sequence="2">94 BOOK REVIEWS analytic language employed by contemporary scholarship, R. Abba, a fourth-century Palestinian amora, appears to be saying that the different names of God reflect the different ways he was perceived by his devotees under varying circumstances. The different names are but metaphors for the single, eternal deity and are not due to any changes in his nature but rather to the varying circumstances which determined people's perceptions of this nature. The book under review tackles the phenomenon from a different tack. Mark Smith investigates the origins of some of the metaphoric language which is used to describe God and contends that since the God of Israel, considered canonically, is comprehended through such language, the history of this language also constitutes the early history of God. Smith bases his arguments on four major changes in scholarly perspec- tive about the relationship between Israel and Canaan during the transition period between the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, ca. 1250-1150 B.C.E.: (1) Israelite culture overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture. There was no conquest and no imposition of a new or different material cul- ture in the land (pp. xxii-xxiii, 1-7). (2) Consequently, El, Baal, Asherah, and their cohorts cannot be viewed as outsiders. They were part of the cul- tural heritage of the Israelites. At times, features from these deities or the deities themselves coalesced ("converged" in Smith's terminology) into the figure of Yahweh; at times, the developing Israelite cult distinguished itself from its Canaanite roots ("differentiated" in Smith's terminology), rejecting beliefs or behaviors that had once been acceptable. An example of conver- gence is the assimilation of El to Yahweh; of divergence, the use of steles and asherah symbols (pp. xxiii-xxiv, 7-26, 95-97, and throughout the book). (3) The monarchy was instrumental in developing religious ideology. On the one hand, it fostered the inclusion of deities into the cult of Yahweh by sup- porting popular religious elements such as Baal's worship, high places, and the cult of the dead; on the other, it encouraged differentiation through cen- tralization and cultic reform. It also incorporated (foreign) elements into the local cult as a potent metaphor for political/cosmic self-aggrandizement; e.g., David the empire builder emphasized Yahweh the warrior (pp. xxiv-xxvi, 55-60, 115-121, 147-152). (4) The goddess Asherah and/or her symbol, the asherah, played a far greater role in Israelite religion than was suspected even ten years ago. This is indicated by various artifacts dis- covered in excavations, but more significantly by the inscriptions from Ajrud, El-Qom, and now also from Philistine Ekron, referring to either the goddess or her symbol, which make imperative a new examination of bibli-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 95 cal references to Asherah (pp. xxvi-xxvii, 80-103 [Yahweh and Anat are discussed on pp. 51-64]). As can be seen from the page references above, Smith does not completely presuppose these conclusions. He dedicates many pages to rearguing them and then uses them as buttresses for his own history of God. Although he does not use the term, Smith's work, like that of any good historian working with documents, is deconstructionist, rejecting the Bible's own claim as to what was normative and legitimate, taking such claims as data not facts. As a result, he is aware of the partial and subjective nature of his conclusions (p. xxxi). His major conclusions are the following: (1) Since the Bible retains many liturgical poems describing Yahweh's nature as well as historical traditions from the period of the judges through the exilic period about cultic activi- ties, the poems can be coordinated with the traditions, both of these with inscriptional evidence and archaeology, and a history written. (2) In the period of the judges, Israelite deities included Yahweh, El, Baal, and Ashe- rah. In the period of the monarchy, the pantheon included Yahweh, Baal, Astarte, the sun, moon, and stars, and perhaps Hadad-Rimon and Tammuz as manifestations of Baal. (3) In the period of the judges, 1200-1000 B.C.E., convergence led to the fusion of El and Yahweh, the grafting of Baal's power and imagery onto Yahweh, and the emergence of Yahweh as a cosmic war- rior associated with an Asherah. During the first half of the monarchy, Yahweh began to emerge as a national deity despite the fact that other cults were officially sponsored alongside his by the royal house. The gradual fusion or addition of other deities or their traits continued apace during this period. Yahweh, like an international conglomerate, absorbed his potential competitors. This eventually led to monolatry, which invited differentiation- ist thinking and divergence. During the second half of the monarchy, the centralizing tendency and the emergence of the covenant idea as crucial in the religious thinking of Jerusalem theologians gave rise to a Yahweh-alone group which advanced a notion of orthopraxis and orthodoxy, and whose intellectual triumph was monotheism (chaps. 6-7). The dependence of these conclusions on the changes in scholarly perspective listed above is obvious. In order to make his case, Smith analyzes thoroughly and exhaustively the various deities which formed the numenic matrix out of which Yahweh emerged. Concerning El, he concludes that El was the original god of Israel (pp. 7-12); concerning Baal, he concludes that the motifs associated with this god in Canaanite literature are widely manifest in Israelite religion and are most likely a result of convergence during the monarchy (pp. 55-57);</page><page sequence="4">96 BOOK REVIEWS concerning Anat, that since she is unattested in the Bible save in some per- sonal names, there is no evidence on which to maintain a hypothesis of direct dependence (p. 63); concerning Asherah, that only a symbol, perhaps a pole, functioned in the Israelite cult, but the goddess herself was not wor- shipped (pp. 88-94). This last conclusion rests on his elimination of the plain meaning of a number of passages as fictions, late glosses, and the like (pp. 89-92). Space permits only a general criticism of chapters 2-3, where the bulk of this material is contained. Smith treats almost everything Canaanite as coeval to Egypt and Phoenicia in the Persian and Hellenistic periods, despite the fact that the data derive from Ugarit in the Late Bronze period. Biblical data, however, are analyzed carefully only after being filleted chronological- ly. This lack of a common standard renders some conclusions questionable, since he interpolates "Canaanite" information into periods where actual relevant data are unattested (pp. 42-43, 81-82, 87). Missing from Smith's discussion is a serious consideration of Yahweh himself either before or after he apparently took El over and then took over for him (p. 8). If one peels off all the layers ascribed to convergence, nothing is left. Once the donut is gone, so is the hole. What is the hub of Yahweh if he was not a leader or a warrior or a shepherd or a nurturing figure? If the theophonic elements at the mythically primal event, Sinai, are due to con- vergence, with what did El and Baal converge? And whence the attributes of mercy, kindness, jealousy, healing, omniscience-the attributes which affected the bond between Yahweh and his devotees? Are all these borrowed too? Part of the answer to these questions lies in the transition period between the Late Bronze and Iron Age periods. Contrary to Smith's claim, recent archaeological data do indicate that between the demise and desertion of Canaanite Late Bronze cities and the establishment of Iron Age villages in their ruins, there was perhaps a century of abandonment. Furthermore, the new villagers introduced different archi- tectural traditions and patterns of urban planning than what had been in use during the Late Bronze Age. And finally, the establishment of the Iron Age sites in territories identified as Israelite proceeded from east to west (cf. I. Finkelstein, The Archaeology of the Israelite Settlement [1988]; Sh. Geva, Eretz-Israel 20 [1989]: 149-153). There is therefore no solid basis for his claim that the Israelite religious culture is a direct continuation of the Canaanite, since a new population was involved. Assuming that this popula- tion was of Yahweh-worshipping Israelites, it is likely that they were influenced by local customs and practices, as the models of Israelite religious</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 97 history rejected by Smith maintain. Although some of the processes described by Smith may have taken place, they did not necessarily have to occur according to the scenario sketched in his book. Furthermore, the developmental scheme that he proposes, from simple to complex, is not necessary. Yahwism in its earliest stage, whenever and wherever it emerged, did so in an ancient Near East that was already ancient, filled with potent metaphors and divine images. The Ugaritic paral- lels, generalized under the term Canaanite for the sake of his argument, remain just that-parallels, not necessarily proof of borrowing, conver- gence, or syncretism. Allowing that the Yahwists had religious sensitivities and some desire to express themselves, they could easily have drawn from their cultural contexts the metaphors that suited their needs at the moment, as R. Abba implied. This does not, however, gainsay the validity of a histori- cally conditioned evolution nuanced by politics, as Smith maintains. Yahwism did have to express the concerns of a people with kings and of kings with people. It does maintain, however, that the beginning may already have been complex and the later changes could have gone in any direction. Smith's book is perhaps less radical a breakthrough than it was intended to be, but it is a useful book. His introduction of the notion of convergence and differentiation provides a framework in which the use of metaphoric language concerning Yahweh can be discussed. Since his notion can be per- ceived as essentially describing a synchronic situation, it should be linked to the notion of tradition and change, which emphasizes the dynamic, dia- chronic axis of development. His discussions of individual texts and/or gods in their relationship to the Bible and particularly his copious bibliographical references deserve to be factored into future studies of Israelite religion. These discussions are balanced and generally thorough. Given his assump- tions, however, the absence of a consideration of Egyptian religious influence in pre-Iron Age Canaan is remarkable. Smith has performed a yeoman's task in isolating the main issues bear- ing on Israelite religion that emerge from the new research in Semitic philo- logy, biblical historiography, and Syro-Palestinian archaeology. For this, he is to be thanked. In addition, he is already envied by many of his col- leagues, this reviewer among them, for coming up with such a clever title.
