Presentation of the Problem The omission of Moses' name from the entire Haggadah is both well known and puzzling. Why has the main character of the Exodus drama vanished without a trace?1 Moreover, the mere omission of Israel's supreme prophet does not suffice for the redactor of the Haggadah. At the end of the "fugitive Aramean" exegesis, which is central to the Haggadah as a whole, Moses' involvement in the Exodus is expressly denied. The Haggadah comments on Deuteronomy 26:8: "The Lord brought us forth from Egypt"?not by an angel, not by a seraph, nor by an agent, but the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself.2 Not only did no heavenly angel or seraph take part in the Exodus;3 not even a flesh and-blood agent was involved. And "agent" in this context can mean only Moses.4 1. Moses is mentioned only in the exegesis in the Haggadah by R. Yose ha-Gelili, who cites Exodus 14:31: "And when Israel saw the wondrous power which the Lord had wielded against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord: they had faith in the Lord and in His servant Moses." The expo sition, however, relies solely on the wording "the wondrous power," and important textual witnesses omit the end of the verse (see Shemuel Safrai and Ze'ev Safrai, Haggadat hazal [Jerusalem: Carta, 1998], 149-50). Moreover, as scholars have already established, the entire passage in the Haggadah, which magnifies the miracles of the splitting of the Red Sea at the expense of the Exodus, is not part of the core text of the Haggadah; see, e.g., Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 146. 2. In the early textual witnesses, the exposition ends here (see Ernst Daniel Goldschmidt, Hag gadah shel pesah ve-toldoteha [Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1960], 44 n. 60; and Jay Rovner, "A New Version of the Eres Israel Haggadah Liturgy and the Evolution of the Eres Israel Miqra ' Bikkurim Midrash," Jewish Quarterly Review 92, no. 3-A [2002]: 427, 432), whereas the other Haggadot add a proof text from Exodus 12:12. The extant Haggadot also add the repeated exposition, "I, Myself, and not an angel ... I, Myself, and not a seraph ... I, Myself, and not an agent ... I am God, and no one else." This repetition, however, is absent from most of the early Haggadot; see, e.g., Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 140. On the addition of a fourth element, "ha-dibur [logos]," in some of the early Haggadot, see Goldschmidt, Haggadah shel pesah, 45 n. 60; and Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 11. 3. This in itself is problematic because the Torah expressly states (Numbers 20:16), "and He sent a messenger [mal'akh, literally "angel"] who freed us from Egypt." We will not discuss the poss ible resolution of this verse by the redactor of the Haggadah because it does not relate to the issue at hand. 4. See n. 18 herein. 61</page><page sequence="2">David Henshke This denial of Moses' contribution to the Exodus, however, pointedly conflicts with the corpus of relevant scriptural verses: The entire Exodus narrative is based on the agency [shelihut] of Moses to bring forth Israel from Egypt. Thus, already at the beginning of Moses' first appointment (Exodus 3:10), we have, "Come, therefore, I will send you [ve-9eshlahakha\ to Pharaoh, and you shall free My people from Egypt," with the language of agency continuing through the entire narrative. What, then, brought forth the Haggadah's dissident exposition, which frontally contradicts the biblical narrative?5 In other rabbinic midrashim, Moses' activity in the Exodus as an agent of the Lord is self-understood;6 the view expressed by the Haggadah is striking in its peculiarity. Therefore, it is not surprising that the extant Haggadot have blunted this difficulty by the addition they include in the exposition: Following the state ment that God himself, without any agent, brought us forth from Egypt, a proof is added in the prevalent Haggadot: [A]s it is said: "For that night I will go through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt, I the Lord." This proof text limits the claim of God's exclusivity to the plague of the firstborn: It was performed without the involvement of any angel or agent; but the Exodus, as a whole, was not executed without the faithful agent, namely, Moses.7 The earliest textual witnesses of the Haggadah, however, lack this proof text, and the patent difficulty of the short version leads us to assume its originality. But this primary version was "corrected" by the addition, which channels and limits the direct divine activity to the plague of the firstborn. Moreover, the conception of the core midrash, which denies Moses' involvement in the entire Exodus, and not just 5. The exegete seems to have used the apparently superfluous mention of "the Lord" (already mentioned in close proximity) to emphasize that he alone effects the redemption. Goldschmidt maintained that this suffices to explain this exegesis, and he did not address the difficulties it raises (Haggadah shel pesah, 45). However, in order to resolve this seeming superfluity, all that would have been necessary was to state that the Lord, and not the angels, brought us forth from Egypt; there was no need or basis to exclude the agent here and thereby to deny all the explicit scriptural passages. 6. See Sifrei Devarim, pis. 27 (ed. Finkelstein, 43); pis. 325 (376); pis. 357 (431); Midrash Tannaim on Deuteronomy 32:35 (ed. Hoffmann, 201); and Y. Sanh?drin 2:1, 20a (Y. Horayot 3:1, 47a). It is noteworthy that Sifrei, pis. 325, Midrash Tannaim, and Y Sanh?drin have the version, "not by an angel, nor by an agent," but in a manner that indicates the involvement of Moses in the Exodus as an agent. A patent expression of this commonly held conception appears in Pesikta Rabbati, Va-yikah 'Eliyahu (ed. Friedmann, 13a): "Thus began R. Tanhuma [the son of R. Abba]: 'But when the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt, it was through a prophet' (Hosea 12:14)?this refers to Moses . . . Moses delivered them from Egypt acting as an agent: 'Come, therefore, I will send you to Pharaoh.'" 7. As was set forth by some of the commentaries on the Haggadah; see, e.g., the commentary by R. Zedekiah ben Abraham (author o?Shibbolei ha-Leket) on the Haggadah in the name of his brother, R. Benjamin (Yaakov Shemuel Spiegel, ed., Seder hovat leyl shimurim: dinei leyl ha-seder uferush ha-haggadah . . . be-sefer shibbolei ha-leket [Lod: Orot Yahadut ha-Magreb, 1998], 87). 62</page><page sequence="3">The Lord Brought us Forth from Egypt in the plague of the firstborn, is noticeable throughout the Haggadah, which system atically excludes any mention of this human leader. Thus, in the view of the Hag gadah redactor, the Exodus in its entirety, and not just the plague of the firstborn, was performed by God himself, with no recourse to the agency of Moses.8 We see that we have two (albeit possibly related) problems before us: first, an exegetical-interpretive problem?how could the redactor of the Haggadah have claimed that there was no involvement of an agent, against all the explicit scriptural passages?and second, an ideological one?what idea could have motivated the redactor to deny Moses' role in the Exodus and to completely conceal his contribution? Until now, scholarly research has concentrated mainly on the second issue, and even here it has not provided a satisfactory answer. In the follow ing section, therefore, we shall begin by discussing the first question?that of the possible basis for the midrash?which will lead us to the ideological issue. II. On the Source and Annals of the Midrash Louis Finkelstein observed that LXX contains an understanding similar to the exegesis of the Haggadah,9 which we will explicate in full here. Ephraim E. Urbach noted that the "not by an angel, not by an agent" expansion was cited by Origen in his commentary to Song of Songs on the verse (1:2) "Oh, give me the kisses of your mouth": The kisses are Christ's, which He bestowed on His church when at His coming, being present in the flesh, He in His own person spoke to her the words of faith and love and peace, according to the promise of Isaias who, when sent beforehand to the Bride, had said: "Not a messenger, nor an angel, but the Lord Himself shall save us."10 Origen based the same exposition of the Haggadah in the prophecy of Isaiah. But where did he find this in the words of the prophet?11 This has already been 8. Not surprisingly, the adaptation of this exegesis by the author of Lekah Tov states simply, '"The Lord brought us forth from Egypt'?He Himself," with no addition. The impossibility of the redemption without direct intervention by the Lord is clearly expressed, but the negative clause "not by an agent," which contradicts all the biblical passages, is omitted. Goldschmidt, who missed the extreme difficulty raised by the exposition (see n. 5 herein), suggested that this was the version of Sifrei possessed by the author of Lekah Tov (Haggadah shel pesah, 44-45). The latter, however, customarily adapted his sources (see, e.g., Menahem Kahana, Akdamot le-hoza 'ah hadashah shel sifrei bamidbar [Jerusalem, 1982], 102) and is not to be regarded as a direct textual witness to Sifrei. Because our version appears in all the direct textual witnesses, the version in Lekah Tov is to be seen as a consequence of the severe difficulty raised by the original exegesis. 9.

This is not the negation of a flesh-and-blood agent (in the manner that Moses, too, is rejected) but rather of both the angel and his fellow occupant of the celestial realm: iw is obviously the heavenly prince, the guardian angel of the nation; neither the mal 'akh nor the sar are comparable to "the help of Thy face."16 At any rate, this version also reflects the structure of LXX and the Haggadah: The delivering countenance of the Lord is contrasted with the two alternative deliverers in the beginning of the passage. The "not by an angel, nor by an agent" exposition could therefore be sup ported by an explicit scriptural text, but the exegete did not employ its vocalization in the MT (is) but rather that on which LXX (is) relies. The exposition in the Haggadah therefore follows the wording in Isaiah: "not a zir, nor an on 1. 4; Lawson, Song of Songs, 323 n. 6; and Ephraim Elimelech Urbach, "The Homiletical Interpret ations of the Sages and the Expositions of Origen on Canticles and the Jewish-Christian Disputation," in Collected Writings in Jewish Studies, ed.

",TX" who noted the use of TX in the piyyut literature, "especially, Moses, the agent of the Holy One, blessed be He; or Moses and Aaron." 14. The question of the contrast between the angel and the "Presence [panav]" of God arises in regard to the relationship between Exodus 23:20, "I am sending an angel before you," and 32:34, "See, My angel shall go before you," on one hand, and, on the other, 33: 14-15: "And He said, 'My Presence [panai] will go with you, and I will lighten your burden.' And he said to Him, 'Unless Your Presence goes with us, do not make us leave this place.'"

See Flusser, Yahadut bayit sheni, 51-52, with references to his earlier publications on this subject (his views on the original version in Isaiah developed over the course of time). Flusser tended to identify the TX reflected in LXX and the Haggadah ("shaliah, emissary") with the "W in 1QM because also he understood shaliah in a heavenly context; see David Flusser, Judaism and the Origins of Christianity (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1968), 252 n. 24. As we shall see, shaliah does not have any heavenly connotation. 64</page><page sequence="5">The Lord Brought us Forth from Egypt angel"?"not by an angel, nor by an agent";17 "His own Presence delivered them"?"but the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself." It is this double format, with both a positive and negative formulation, that is cited by Origen.18 It seems now that we possess the key to resolving the immanent difficulty with the midrash's negation of Moses' agency in the Exodus. If the verse in Isaiah serves as the source of the Haggadah's exegesis, then the resolution of our problem is to be found in the continuation of Isaiah (v. 12): "Who made His glorious arm march at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to make Himself a name for all time." The agent (Moses) had no inde pendent significance in the act of redemption. He was not granted any powers with which he acted on his own, and the entire drama of redemption was effected by God himself: With his glorious arm, he took hold of Moses' arm and guided it in all its movements.19 17. In the Bible, nx comes before mal'akh, whereas the midrash reverses the order because the biblical TX was translated by the rabbis into their terminology?"shaliah," which was preceded, as is common in rabbinic practice, by the phonetically shorter "mal'akh," as was "saraf" (see Shamma Friedman, "Kol ha-kazar kodem," Leshonenu 35 [1971]: 117-29, 192-206). Furthermore, they are in a "neither this nor that" format: Not only is an angel or seraph absent, but also the agent Moses played no part in this event. 18. All the sources with the format of this exegesis speak solely of the angel-agent pair (see Mekhilta, Pis. 1 [ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 23]; Mekhilta, Shabbta' 1 [340]; Sifrei Devarim, pis. 42 [88]; and idem, pis. 325 [375]), and only the Haggadah adds a third term, "seraph." This addition seems to reflect the desire to resolve the crux of the difficulty of how Moses was removed from the act of redemption. If we join "seraph" to "angel" as two examples of a single heavenly type, then even the "agent" might not be a human emissary but a third type of heavenly being; see the commentaries by the Rish 'onim (early authorities) collected by Mordekhai Leib Katzenelbogen, Haggadah shel pesah torat hayyim (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1998), 106-107. Consequently, Moses would be out of place here. But this is a forced interpretation because "shaliah," as it was used by the rabbis, lacks any heavenly nuance and is in contraposition to the heavenly "angel" (see, e.g., Aba Bendavid, Leshon mikra' u-leshon hakhamim, vol. 1 [Jerusalem: Dvir, 1967], 277 para. 14). The word "agent" is frequently used in relation to Moses?specifically, both in the phrase "not by an angel, not by an agent" (see Sifrei Devarim,pis. 325 [375]; and Midrash Tannaim on Deuteronomy 32:35 [ed. Hoffmann, 201]) and in general. See Sifra, Mekhilta ' de-Milu 'im 1:38 (end of zav): "'And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord had commanded Moses' (Leviticus 8:36)?the messenger is worthy of the One who sent him." Similarly, at the end of Sifra {Be-hukotai 13:8), "'which the Lord commanded Moses' (Leviticus 27:34)?the messenger is worthy of the One who sent him,'. . . Moses for the Israelite people' (idem)?the messenger is worthy of those to whom he is sent, and those to whom he is sent are worthy of him"; and, in different wording, in Sifra {Be-hukotai 8:12): '"that the Lord established, through Moses on Mount Sinai' (Leviticus 26:46)?Moses had the merit of being made the intermediary between Israel and their Father in heaven" (each of the three passages in Sifra uses the same Hebrew wording: shaliah). See also Shir ha-Shirim Rabba 1:2:3^4; Avot de-Rabbi Natan, A:l (ed. Schechter, p. 1). On such appellations of Moses with the meaning of "intermediary," see Saul Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962), 81-82. Indeed, the Haggadah's removal of Moses from the scene is reflected in the intriguing fact that he is not mentioned throughout the entire Haggadah. 19. On these two conceptions of the meaning of "agent" in the legal world (the extension of the sender, in general, or one authorized to act independently), see David Henshke, "Agency and Divorce Proceedings: On the Legal Methodology of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah," Jewish Law Annual 14 (2003): 168 and n. 8. 65</page><page sequence="6">David Henshke The annals of the Haggadah's exegesis can therefore be delineated: At first, the early midrash was supported by the text in Isaiah, whether the exegete's text was vocalized as "z/r" or whether his exposition diverged from the accepted vocalization.20 This proof text, however, could not stand as it was because the prevalent reading of the text is that of the keri: "In all their troubles He was troubled." As early as the tannaitic period, the verse in Isaiah was read as God's participation in the suffering of Israel,21 an understanding that was readily accepted because of its comforting message.22 Consequently, the exegesis of the Haggadah could not be based on a different reading that fundamentally contra dicted the prevalent reading of the verse. The pressing necessity, however, of a proof text for the surprising exposition, as well as the need to resolve the serious difficulty that it raised, resulted in an alternative proof from the plague of the firstborn. On one hand, the emphasis of the verse ("I the Lord") definitely teaches of his exclusivity in this action while, on the other hand, there is no com prehensive contradiction of the Exodus story as a whole because Moses' agency is denied only for the plague of the firstborn. Now that we have uncovered the possible source of the exegesis of the Hag gadah, this may aid us regarding the background and orientation of this revolution ary midrash, which denies Moses any involvement in his life's enterprise.23 III. On the Orientation of the "Not by an Agent" Exegesis: Who Wanted to Hide Moses? Our assumption of the origin of this exposition in Isaiah does not exempt us from exploring the orientation and background of such a startling midrashic expansion. First, the exegete might very well have possessed two readings of Isaiah 63:9, and he chose to base his exposition on one. However, even if we imagine that the early exegete was aware of only the LXX reading of the verse, he still preferred this single verse, which was eventually given to different interpretations, to the message emerging from all the verses in the Torah. 20. According to the view that the Talmud terms "yesh 'em la-masoret [the masoretic vocaliza tion is not necessarily authoritative]." On the formulation of this term in the Babylonian Talmud, see David Henshke, "Le-mashma'o ha-tanna'i shela-bituy 'K-iptf? DK vr\" Tarbiz 62 (1993): 433-46. 21. See, e.g., Mekhilta, Pisha \pis. 14 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 51); Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai on Exodus 12:41 (ed. Epstein-Melamed, 34); Mekhilta, Amalek,pis. 2, 186; Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai on Exodus 17:15, 126; Sifrei Bamidbar, pis. 84 (ed. Horovitz, 83); and Sifrei Zuta on Numbers 10:35 (ed. Horovitz, 267). 22. See Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, vol. 6 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1959), 26 n. 150: "The conception 'that God joins Himself unto His people when it suffers' ... is of frequent occurrence." See also his references. 23. We should note the wording of Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hit. Hamez u-Mazah 7:2: "And if the son is old and wise [enough], he is taught of what happened to us in Egypt, and the miracles that were performed for us by Moses." The unique standing enjoyed by Moses in Maimonides' teach ing led the latter to include Moses here, whereas the Haggadah completely concealed his role. This was already alluded to by Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah) (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1980), 455 n. 239. 66</page><page sequence="7">The Lord Brought us Forth from Egypt The ideological background of the exposition, in the wake of which Moses is with drawn from the founding narrative of his history and that of the people of Israel, still requires clarification. David Daube, who offered the version "and not the messenger" (emphasis added), has found an anti-Christian allusion in this use of the definite article: The redeemer is not Jesus but God himself.24 He regards Moses' disappearance from the entire Haggadah as based in this anti-Christian predilection.25 But the definite article, which, at any rate, proves very little, is absent from the earliest copies of the Haggadah.26 Another basis for the anti-Christian polemic in the Haggadah was suggested by F. E. Meyer, referring to a teaching by Justin Martyr, who interpreted "I am sending an angel before you" (Exodus 23:20) as a reference to Jesus.27 In response, the Haggadah proclaims, "I, Myself, and not an angel; I, Myself, and not an agent." Moses' name was consequently deleted from the Haggadah text because he, his Torah, and his redemption were perceived by Christians as the archetype of their messiah, his new teaching, and his redemption. The author of the Haggadah therefore stressed the redemption's independence of Moses: God redeemed us in complete singularity, unaccompanied by any agents or helpers.28 This theory was also adopted by Israel Jacob Yuval.29 The origin, however, of the exegesis in LXX, and its adoption by the church father Origen (as we saw in the preceding section), do not accord with its assumed birth in an anti-Christian polemic, nor were these details mentioned by those scho lars. Indeed, additional explanations of the orientation of the midrash have been raised: the aversion in the priestly circles to overly ennoble Moses, who was a mere L?vite;30 conversely, the opposition to the Hasmoneans, who assumed the crowns of both royalty and priesthood?and Moses is an example of a king who also officiated as priest; and finally, the antagonism to the ideational direc tions that elevated Moses to the rank of demigod, whether in the teachings of 24.

However, according to all these explanations, including the anti-Christian explanation, we would expect to find a general tendency to downplay and conceal the character of Moses, not only in the context of the Exodus, as these explicative directions raised by scholars should have led to the sequestering of the other major undertaking of Moses, namely, the giving of the Torah. Moses' prominent role in the Revelation is no less dangerous, for the very same reasons. But with the exception of the Exodus, we do not find any all-encompassing silencing of Moses' activity.32 Moses himself is apparently not the focus here but rather the redemption and deliverance that he aided in bringing about. The motif of deliverance is introduced in the prophecy by Isaiah, which is the possible foundation for the exegesis of the Haggadah. Now that the redemption narrative, and not Moses, is at the center, the explanation for Moses' disappearance should be examined in accordance with its suitability to the redemption narrative as a whole, as it is fashioned in the exegesis of the Haggadah. The following proposed explanation for the ideological under pinnings of the redemption narrative, according to the Haggadah, might well be the key, not only to the question of Moses but also to additional essential questions that arise in the Haggadah's exposition of the redemption narrative. IV. A Suggested Solution: The Haggadah Rejects Human Redemptive Activism The author of the Haggadah might have been saying that redemption is not the fruit of efforts by flesh and blood; the keys of redemption remain in God's hands. Patently, the Exodus narrative is liable to teach the opposite, for Moses the man of forceful action, daring, and understanding, was sent by Divine Provi dence to redeem Israel; this is a lesson for all time, meant to encourage active 31. See the concise summation of most of the explanations by Avigdor Shinan, "Madu 'a lo nizkar Mosheh rabbeinu ba-haggadah shel pesahV Amudim 39 (1991): 172-74. See also Jakob Josef Petuchowski, '"Do This in Remembrance of Me' (I Cor 11 24)," Journal of Biblical Literature 76 (1957): 295-96; and Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 12. Yuval, Shenei goyim be-vitnekh, 95 n. 120, included here Shir ha-Shirim Rabba 3:2: '"Upon my couch at night' (Song of Songs 3:1)?this refers to the night of Egypt; T sought the one I love'?this refers to Moses; T sought, but found him not.'" Yuval thus follows Menahem M. Kasher, Torah shelemah, vol. 12 (New York, 1948), 27, para. 505, who regarded this exegesis as reflecting the removal of Moses' name from the narrative. This explanation, however, is forced, and the midrash apparently refers to Moses' distance from the troubles of Egypt when he was in Midian for many years; see the commentaries ad loc. 32. See, e.g., Mekhilta, Shirata' 1,117 (and the parallels listed by Horovitz): "Moses devoted himself with his entire soul to three things, that were named after him. He devoted himself with his entire soul to the Torah, as it is said (Malachi 3:22): 'Remember the law of Moses My servant.'" On the abundant and diverse midrashic material that describes Moses' decisive role in the Revelation, see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 4:106-19, and the wealth of material in his notes (6:43-50 nn. 238-60).

The exegete of the Haggadah con sequently had to underscore, "The Lord brought us forth from Egypt"?not by means of an angel, nor was this expedited by an agent. Moses did nothing by dint of his own powers; rather, the Lord held his right hand and led him every step of the way (as Isaiah states). Thus Moses vanishes from the Haggadah and, with him, the threat of redemptive activism?all is in the hands of God, and in his hands alone. Although we cannot date the birth of the "not by an angel" exposition, nor can we conjecture when it was incorporated in the context of the Passover Hagga dah, the foregoing discussion nevertheless enables us to surmise the historical background for its inclusion. This was a period that witnessed appreciable efforts by Jews to bring about redemption by their own capabilities, a phenomenon against which certain rabbinic circles warned. Was this the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt? Or perhaps other periods marked by a redemptive initiative? I doubt that we are capable of providing an authoritiative answer. At this juncture, we should inquire whether the conception of the rejection of messianic activism is actually the basis of the exposition of the Haggadah and whether it is evident in additional parts of this exposition. We will begin with the passage preceding the "fugitive Aramean" exegesis: [F]or the Holy One, blessed be He, calculates33 the time [ha-kez] to fulfill what was said to Abraham at the covenant between the pieces. Why the emphasis on the role of the Holy One, blessed be he, in the calculation? The usual explanation is that this exegesis alludes to the well-known midrashic reconciliation of the period of time stated to Abraham ("They shall be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years," Genesis 15:13) with the actual duration of Egyptian servitude, which, based on a calculation of the generations, lasted only 210 years.34 According to this explanation, the Haggadah alludes that God did not start the count of 400 years from the beginning of Egyptian bondage but from the birth of Isaac.35 There is also a numerical value (gimatriya *) allusion here: The numerical value of f"p is 190; subtracted from 400, this leaves the 210 years of servitude.36 Shemuel and Ze'ev Safrai, however, have already noted that this explanation attributes to the Haggadah matters that are completely absent from it: Not only is there no hint of this gimatriya', but also the Haggadah makes no mention of the entire course of the calculation (from the birth of Isaac).37 Therefore, these 33. Mehashev (and not hishev, calculated, as in the extant Haggadot), which is the version of the earliest of the Haggadot; see Goldschmidt, Haggadah shel pesah, 79; Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 287; and Rovner, "A New Version," 431. 34.

Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 126. 69</page><page sequence="10">David Henshke scholars suggest that the Haggadah is alluding to the famous disagreement between R. Eliezer and R. Joshua on the relationship between redemption and repentance: The former asserts that redemption is dependent on repentance, without which it will not come, whereas R. Joshua maintains that redemption is dependent solely on "its time"?even if Israel has not repented.38 The intent of the Haggadah, therefore, accords with R. Joshua: the Holy One, blessed be he, will bring the redemption at its proper, predetermined time, under any conditions.39 The relevance, however, of the Exodus to this disagreement is questionable because it refers to the future redemption, and, in essence, the Egyptian exile was not a consequence of sins for which repentance was required. Moreover, it was explicitly limited from the outset to a defined period of time. To aid our understanding, we should include here the famous tannaitic midrash concerning the Ephraimites, who (unsuccessfully) sought to expedite the time (kez) of the redemption and go forth from Egypt prematurely.40 The criticism of the Ephraimites now joins the Haggadah: "The Holy One, blessed be He"?and only he?"calculates the time," for the reckoning of the redemp tion is not given over to flesh and blood. Human pretensions in this context are doomed to failure. This passage, then, is an additional expression of the Hag gadah's fundamental confirmation of human passivity in the process of redemp tion. The "not by an agent" exegesis teaches that the act of redemption is reserved for the Lord, that it is not for any human agent. This passage states that even the calculation of the proper time for redemption is a solely divine preserve. Now we are capable of uncovering the background of the exposition that begins the "wandering Aramean" passage in the Haggadah. The Haggadah applies this verse (nansa 7T1 "ox *nx "mtt) to Laban the Aramean, who sought to destroy Jacob. The medieval literal commentators, however, had already observed that this interpretation does not correspond to the wording of the verse (because mx is not a transitive verb but modifies "^"ix), and primarily, it does not suit the context: Jacob's going down to Egypt has nothing to do with the episode with Laban. Moreover, this verse is among those recited by the one bring ing firstfruits to the Temple, to which Laban is not relevant.41 Indeed, we now know that along with this interpretation, the tannaitic literature also contained the simple explanation of the verse, according to which "Aramean" describes 38. Y. Ta'anit 1:1, 63d; B. Sanh?drin 97b, and parallels. 39. Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 126. 40. See Mekhilta, Petihata ' to Va-yehi, 76-77, and the parallels listed there.

The answer seems to emerge from the passage adjoining the exposition that precedes it: This44 is what sustained our forefathers and us. For not only one [foe] has arisen against us to destroy us, but in each generation they rise against us to destroy us,45 while the Holy One, blessed be He, rescues us from their hand. Go forth and learn what Laban the Aramean sought to do to our father Jacob, for the wicked Pharaoh decreed only against the males, while Laban desired to uproot all, as it is said, ""ax "QN "TTiN." The argument that Pharaoh was not alone in his attempt to annihilate the Israelite nation compelled the author of the Haggadah to interpret this phrase as meaning that Laban the Aramean wanted to destroy my father, thus confirming the declara tion that in every generation, they rise against us to destroy us: Pharaoh was not the first to do so, as he had been preceded by Laban.46 42. See Joseph Tabory, '"Al nusah ha-haggadah be-zman ha-bayit," Sinai 82 (1978): 102-106, and the literature listed there; and David Henshke, "Midrash 'arami 'oved 'avi," Sidra 4 (1988): 37 n. 15. We now possess Sifrei Zuta on Deuteronomy, ed. Menahem Kahana (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2003), 415, which explicitly subscribes to this view; see the gloss by Kahana, 416-17. 43. In my article "Midrash 'arami," 38-39,1 sought to show that, in addition to the other tan naitic sources that bear testimony to this interpretation, the Mishnah, which states that the order of the exegesis is (M. Pesahim 10:4) "He begins with the disgrace and ends with the praise," also refers to this interpretation. According to the interpretation in the extant Haggadah, "begins with the disgrace" is not parallel to "ends with the praise" because this does not speak of the disgrace of Israel but of Laban. Second, the idea of a beginning is not relevant here because the episode involving Laban does not signal the beginning of Israelite annals. It is the literal interpretation?that this phrase refers to the sorry state of the Israelite patriarchs at the beginning of their history?that is suitable to a narrative that "begins with the disgrace." 44. Hi (and not "Ve-hi"), which is the version in the earliest versions of the Haggadah; see Goldschmidt, Haggadah shel pesah, 79; and Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 215, 287. 45. Some versions omit "but in each generation" or include it out of place because of the like wording in the two ("to destroy us"?"to destroy us"); see Goldschmidt, Haggadah shel pesah, 79 and n. 6; and Safrai and Safrai, Haggadat hazal, 287. 46. Lachs asserts that these are two separate passages that were erroneously joined together: The Haggadah first stated that in each generation, they rise against us to destroy us, which it derived from the episode of Laban, who sought to uproot all, as it is said, ""ax *nx ,?"is"; the exposition of the "fugitive Aramean" passage begins only after this, and it understood "Aramean" in its simple meaning, not as referring to Laban. Deuteronomy 26:5 was therefore initially stated twice (as a con clusion to "Go forth and learn," and as an introduction to the exegesis); as time passed, the second mention was omitted, and the two passages became one. See Samuel Tobias Lachs, "Two Related Arameans," Journal for the Study of Judaism 17 (1986): 68-69. This implies, however, that the words ""ON "QK ^"ltf" lacked any midrashic expansion, in contrast with the other sections of the 71</page><page sequence="12">David Henshke This admittedly resolves one difficulty but at the cost of raising another, more serious objection: Why did the author of the Haggadah see fit, in the narrative of the Exodus from Egypt, of all stories, and on the night of its celebra tion, of all nights, to downplay the nature of this event, to blunt its uniqueness, and to find precedents? This difficulty looms even larger because this presentation of the narrative of Laban and the rescue from him as being as great as the tale of the Exodus is quite distant from the spirit of scripture.47 Our basic understanding, however, finely explains this as well. The author of the Haggadah wanted to firmly implant the awareness that redemption is solely in the hands of Heaven; the story of the Exodus was not an isolated incident but rather a general paradigm for Israelite redemption. The author of the Haggadah thereby sought to discount the uniqueness of Egyptian servitude by its incorpor ation in the grand scheme of history: In each generation, they rise against us to passage, even though they begin the passage and are the most difficult to comprehend, and certainly are in need of exposition. The extant Haggadah clearly understands this as a reference to Laban, and this is the exegesis of the verse. 47. Goldschmidt, Haggadah shelpesah, 34-35, correctly rejected the exaggerated claims made by Finkelstein, "The Oldest Midrash," 299-301, and questioned the interpretive background for the Aramean-Laban exegesis, but he did not relate to the fundamental question of the reason to diminish the significance of the Exodus; nor did Safrai and Safrai examine this issue. Daube, "The Earliest Struc ture," 189-92, argued that the Haggadah's exposition of Jacob's departure for Egypt in the wake of Laban's persecution underlies the narrative in Matthew (2: 13-14) of the angel of the Lord telling Jesus' father to flee to Egypt in order to save his son from Herod. Yuval, Shenei goyim, 100-102, raised the opposite argument: It was the Haggadah that transformed the Christian narrative when it asserted that Jacob went down to Egypt as a result of Laban's oppression, which explains Laban's entry to the stage. Yuval's argument is based on additional difficulties: Where does Scripture allude that Laban sought to uproot all? Where do we see that in Jacob's journey to Egypt, he was "compelled by the [divine] word," as he went there to see Joseph? Yuval concludes from all these difficulties that the Haggadah replaced the Christian narrative: It was Jacob, the victim of Laban the Aramean, who was commanded by the angel ("the [divine] word") to go down to Egypt. This, however, is fundamentally flawed. Laban's intent is derived from his explicit statement ("I have it in my power to do you harm," Genesis 31:29), and Jacob descends to Egypt in accordance with the divine mandate (Genesis 46:3), "And He said: T am God, the God of your father. Fear not to go down to Egypt,'" which Hizkuni interprets as, '"Fear [tira*] not' is said only to one who fears [mityare']." Additionally, the language "by the word" applies only to God, not to an angel. See, e.g., Vayikra Rabba 1:9 (ed. Margulies, 24): "It is written regarding Abraham (Genesis 22:15): 'The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven'?the angel calls, and the word speaks, but in this case R. Avin said: The Holy One said, I am the One who calls, and I am the one who speaks"; Pesikta Rabbati, "Ba-Yom ha-Shemini" (ed. Friedmann, lib): "I buried her there only by the word, for I desired to bring her up and bury her, but I was not allowed by the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said (Genesis 48:7): 'and I buried her sham [usually translated "there"]'?what is the meaning of 'sham'? By the [divine] word" (see Midrash 'Aggadah on Numbers 33:38 [ed. Buber, 168]: '"at the command of the Lord and died there'?this teaches that he died with a kiss, that he did not die by an angel, but by the [divinej word"). Nor is there any connection between the aged Jacob's going to Egypt and his being pursued by Laban in his youth (which is one of the famous difficulties with the exegetical interpretation of ^K *nx ,?"iK""; see n. 41 herein). Setting the Christian legend as the background of the exegesis is therefore forced, and the difficulty with the diminution of the Egyptian servitude remains. 72</page><page sequence="13">The Lord Brought us Forth from Egypt destroy us, beginning with Laban, continuing with Pharaoh, and thus in this author's time as well. The presentation of distress as a constant companion of Jewish history, from its very beginnings, eliminates the need for response and the active search for a solution: All is foreseen and set within a historical frame work that is known in advance. There is only a sole remedy for this recurring mis fortune: "the Holy One, blessed be He"?He and no other?"rescues us from their hand." "Go forth and learn" from the behavior of Laban that, at the very inception of the tribes of Israel, they faced annihilation at his hands?and they were deliv ered from him only by divine intervention, for only God saved us from the intent of Laban "to do you harm" (Genesis 31:29) when he came to the Aramean in a dream by night and warned him (v. 24): "Beware of attempting anything. . . ."48 Thus, the "OK *HN *7nx midrash, from beginning to end, was infused by a distinct historical conception: It is the fate of Israel to be beset in every generation by baleful enemies, and only a single prospect for salvation is to be sought: God, he and no other, will save us and will continue to save us, time after time. Israel is to remain passive: The uniqueness of current historical circumstances is of no regard because this is the case in every generation. We are not to calculate the end, for God is entrusted with this task, nor are we to arise and act for our redemption?God alone, not an angel nor an agent, will rescue us from their hand.49 The historical backdrop to this conception is quite unmistakable, although we cannot place it within a specific period; similar his torical circumstances may produce analogous ideological responses. * * * Not only does the entire Passover Haggadah ignore Moses, the central figure of the Exodus, but also the exegesis of "the Lord brought us forth from Egypt" expressly denies any agency in these events. Based on our detailed analysis of this exposition and our examination of its sources and history, we have set forth a new proposal for its ideational direction. This orientation?of opposition to human redemptive activism?is the key to understanding additional puzzling passages in the heart of the Haggadah, and apparently it is one of the major directions of the extant Haggadah. David Henshke Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel 48. This corresponds closely with the scholarly conjecture that this "Aramean" is to be under stood as a Roman; see Finkelstein, "The Oldest Midrash," 300-301; Yehudah Ibn Shmuel, Midreshei ge'ulah (Ramat-Gan: Bialik Institute-Masada, 1954), introduction, 51 n. 67; and Berger, "Three Typo logical Themes," 161-62. According to this, the amplification of the danger posed by Laban refers to the hardship under Roman rule, which sought to uproot all?but only God will rescue us from their hand. 49. In tempestuous historical circumstances, the Exodus narrative, despite the Haggadah's efforts, might very well encourage activism, which could find support specifically in the Haggadah. Thus, a religious Zionist leader opined that the assemblage of Tannaim in Bnei Brak, in which they told of the Exodus, was actually a clandestine meeting for organizing the revolt against the Romans.
