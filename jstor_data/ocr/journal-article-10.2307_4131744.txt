Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002. 260 pp. Cynthia Baker's Rebuilding the House of Israel is one of a handful of stud- ies that seek to interpret Jewish culture during late antiquity by setting rabbinic sources and archaeological remains from the Land of Israel in dialogue. Baker is a careful and perceptive reader of both the primary tannaitic sources that she dis- cusses and of the material record. In fact, the body of the book, in which she dis- cusses the domestic context (well titled "The Well-Ordered Bayit: Bodies, Houses and Rabbis in the Ancient Galilee") and the marketplace ("Men, Women and the Shuk: Cultural Currencies on the Open Market") is a well-written description and analysis of the preserved evidence. Baker shows, for example, that rabbinic no- tions of privacy and the placement of windows within extant structures reflect sim- ilar interests. More important, she shows the ways that various spaces, both public and private, were used by ancient Jewish women, and how gender issues played out within environments constructed by Jewish men and women in Roman Pales- tine. The impetus for this study was not ultimately Rabbinic literature or archae- ology, however. It is what Baker sees as a misconception in recent scholarship. Baker argues against a position whereby Jewish women in antiquity were starkly limited to the domestic realm, while the public realm (and even elements of the private) were reserved for men. Baker's methodological discussion ("Space, Material Discourses and the Art of Cultural Production") is noticeably different from the rest of the book. Here her prose is far less clear. This section is clearly addressed to initiates of the postmod- ern discourse. Baker ties the "architectures of gender" to the supposed "rebuild- ing" of Judaism by that "small handful of Jewish voices"-the ancient rabbis- 372</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews whose classical period continued from the late first into the fourth centuries. She then provides an image of the household and village life of women. Most of the architectural evidence adduced by Baker dates to the fourth through sixth or seventh centuries. Although it is true that Jewish culture in late antiquity was extremely conservative, this chronological disconnect between the literary and archaeological sources should be dealt with explicitly, especially because Baker accepts notions of"non-Rabbinic Judaism" developed by the Goodenough/Smith school. Baker's study would have been enriched and strengthened through com- parison with parallel Semitic languages and the ample evidence for non-Jewish housing in Palestine and in neighboring regions. Deeper interaction with Amora- ic literature and Byzantine-period sources would have added significantly, because these do date to the same time as the buildings that Baker discusses. In addition, Baker might have engaged more seriously the tools of modern Talmudic research. There is little evidence that she consulted either manuscript traditions nor the me- dieval and modern critical literature (other than Albeck's Mishnah and Lieberman's Tosefta ki-fshutah). Cynthia Baker's Rebuilding the House oflsrael: Architectures of Gender in Jewish Antiquity provides important insights into the role of women in Jewish "places" in rabbinic Palestine. Baker has shown that the place of Jewish women during late antiquity was truly in the home, as well as in the marketplace, and in all other areas where Jewish culture flourished during these pivotal centuries.
