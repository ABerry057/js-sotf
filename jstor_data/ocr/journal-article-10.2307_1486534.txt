<plain_text><page sequence="1">Baila Round Shargel. Lost Love: The Untold Story of Henrietta Szold, Unpublished Diary and Letters. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1997. xii, 382 pp. Henrietta Szold's diary of despair, chronicling her failure to win the love of the eminent scholar Louis Ginzberg, is one of the most painful accounts I have ever read. It exposes the frailties of the woman who stands, even today, as the leading icon of American Jewish womanhood. The tale of the extraordinary friendship of these giants of twentieth-century Jewry is well known. Szold, born in 1860, was, by the time she presented "What Judaism Has Done for Women" at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, the leading Jewish woman of her day. A writer, lecturer, pioneering educator, and communal organizer, Szold was also the executive secretary-in effect the underpaid editor and translator--of the Publication Committee of the Jewish Publication Society. In 1903, devastated by the death of her father, Rabbi Benjamin Szold, she</page><page sequence="2">154 BOOK REVIEWS turned to New York's Jewish Theological Seminary of America, seeking the training in rabbinics she believed essential to edit his manuscripts. There she applied her literary, linguistic, and editorial talents to the scholarship of the Seminary's foreign-born faculty. Among these was Louis Ginzberg. Born in Kovno, Russia, in 1873, Ginzberg integrated two very different intellectual traditions, the classical world of the Lithuanian yeshivot with the Semitics scholarship of the German university. In 1902, Ginzberg joined the Seminary faculty as professor of Talmud. There Szold met the scholar, thirteen years her junior. For the spinster of forty-three, it was love at first sight. Their remarkable friendship came to a shattering conclusion for her when, in 1908, the professor returned from a summer in Europe to announce that in less than a year he would marry another. Until now the Szold-Ginzberg correspondence remained buried in the archives. Only a privileged few had ever seen another record of their relationship, the journal Szold began in the wake of the traumatic break in her relationship with Ginzberg. To her great credit, Baila Round Shargel, author of Practical Dreamer: Israel Friedlander and the Shaping ofAmerican Judaism (1985), a fine study of another of the Seminary's early faculty, won the confidence of the Szold family, which closely guarded access to the diary. Understanding that the diary sheds new light on the history of early twentieth-century American Jewry, on the men of the Seminary, on New York's immigrant life, and on the travails of Jewish publishing, Shargel secured permission to publish the letters and the diary. Lost Love confirms the wisdom of the family's confidence in Shargel. The gifted historian introduces the texts by describing the concentric circles of Szold's and Ginzberg's world. She emphasizes the multiple and pivotal roles Szold played in Ginzberg's life. The German-speaking scholar, unsure of his English, depended upon the translator to set his work before American Jewry. The woman in love freely tendered her services, translating his letters and articles, his classroom and public lectures. For Ginzberg's magnum opus, The Legends of the Jews, whose first four volumes the Jewish Publication Society issued between 1909 and 1913, she "was more coauthor than mere translator." Indeed Ginzberg privately referred to the Legends as "our book" (pp. 10-11). Beyond working together, the two spent a great deal of time together. The letters and diary dwell upon their long strolls in Riverside Park, Ginzberg</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 155 dining at the Szold home (an almost daily occurrence during the 1907-1908 academic year), their Shabbat afternoons, and his small gifts. Szold's reaction to Ginzberg's engagement forms the heart of an enduring legend. The scholar asked Szold to congratulate his bride-to-be. Presumably oblivious to her true feelings, the professor proceeded as he had in the past, working, dining, and walking with Szold. Weeks later, when she could no longer endure the charade, the woman who believed herself spurned confronted the scholar indifferent to her charms. Subsequently, Szold endured a deep and prolonged depression. Writing the diary became, as Shargel discerns, one step on her road to recovery. Another, the one the legend emphasizes, was her journey to Palestine. When Szold returned to New York, she set herself upon a new course, leading American women to build the lasting legacy of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization. At the core of Lost Love lies the Szold-Ginzberg correspondence and the diary. Shargel has arranged the texts chronologically, unfolding for the reader the relationship as Szold lived it. Those seeking details of Szold's infatuation will find them here. However, I hope the reader will continue beyond the close of the diary, for Shargel ends Lost Love with a crucially important epilogue. Here she counters those who have determined to cast Szold's life by seeing the Ginzberg "trial" as the pivotal event propelling her away from the "'masculine' life of the mind" toward the "'feminine,' 'practical' pursuits" of social welfare (p. 320). Shargel proves this dichotomy false. Long before her breakdown, Szold was drawn to the practical work of education, culture, and Zionism. Moreover, her letters to Ginzberg reveal her as already pondering the activist position she would assume after 1912. Those seeking to understand the constraints Victorian middle-class conventions imposed upon women's lives would do well to read Shargel's analysis. Finally, I must issue a word of caution. Last spring one of my students, an intern in Hadassah's Washington Action Office, asked me what to read to help her contextualize her experience. When she suggested Lost Love, I quickly answered no. Lost Love is not where to begin learning about the woman who founded Hadassah. It describes and explains the consequences of a single dark episode in the eighty-five years of a remarkable woman whose intelligence and energy enabled her to leave a lasting legacy to American Jewry. Probably, in directing my student to begin her encounter with Szold elsewhere, I have helped to perpetuate Szold the icon. Lost Love must be</page><page sequence="4">156 BOOK REVIEWS read, but only by those already somewhat familiar with Szold's life and work. Only then can I share in Shargel's assessment that the publication of Lost Love, "far from tarnishing" Szold's memory, has "burnished" it (p. xii). Pamela S.
