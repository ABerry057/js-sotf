<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Patterson. Along the Edge ofAnnihilation: The Collapse and Recovery of Life in the Holocaust Diary. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1999. xi, 311 pp. David Patterson's Along the Edge ofAnnihilation: The Collapse and Recov- ery ofLife in the Holocaust Diary adds to the ever-growing collection of analyses of Holocaust literature by focussing specifically on diaries. Two obvious goals of a study such as this would be to give the diarists a voice (or, to put it another way, to give readers an introduction to a variety of diaries) and to develop a theory about the place of diaries in Holocaust literature. In the first matter, Patterson bases his study on more than fifty diaries written during the Holocaust by Jewish victims. The reader need only consult the primary sources in the bibliography for a listing of diaries available to be read in their entirety. (I will say more about this later.) In the case of the second matter, Patterson offers a strict definition of the genre of Holocaust diary, which functions to include only those diaries that express their "love for the community of Israel" (p. x). Similar to other diarists, Patterson explains, a Holocaust diarist felt an impulse to record experience and to recover time and meaning, but in addition, was "accountable" to his community (p. 21). On its behalf, the diarist began and ended his writings with a "why " (p. 25). While the features of the genre Patterson establishes may be found in some diaries, they surely are not found in all. Ironically, his use of Etty Hillesum's diary, An Inter- rupted Life,1 to explain that a diary "usually regarded as a Holocaust diary ... in truth is not" (p. 25) reveals the arbitrariness of his taxonomy. It is therefore worth looking closely at his comments on this particular writer and her diary. Hillesum's diary does not satisfy the genre Patterson creates because it does not, he claims, ask why or take the other to be of prime importance; yet various scholars of Holocaust literature refer to it positively.2 In his brief analysis of Hille- 1.

In fact, one might guess that Hillesum was Polish when Patterson queries her words, "Even if we are consigned to Hell, let us go there as gracefully as we can," with "Is she suggesting that the mothers of the Warsaw ghetto should send their children to the flames of Treblinka with grace?" (p. 26). That Hillesum would not be thinking of the mothers of the Warsaw ghetto is both apparent and reasonable; she died in 1943 in Westerbork (Patterson mentions that Hillesum was confined in Westerbork), a transit camp that was the last stop before Auschwitz for Dutch Jews. Patterson does not take into account the material real- ity of Hillesum's life; thus he can project back onto her a concern we all share now-the experiences of the mothers of the Warsaw ghetto and countless other suffering individuals whose experiences we attempt to understand through the records they have left us-while he ignores the larger context of her writing. Asserting that Hillesum's diary is not only not a Holocaust diary, but also that "although it is written by a Jew, it is not a Jewish diary" (p. 27), Patterson con- flates "Holocaust diary" with "Jewish diary." Thus he limits further the first term, as well as giving a special definition to the second-a diary must be concerned with others to be a Jewish diary. The few lines he selects in defense of this and his other disclaimers concerning Hillesum's diary are too few to prove his point, es- pecially because diaries generally reveal greater inconsistencies in the inner life than do memoirs or autobiographies. By the same token, it is not possible here to give sufficient quotation to demonstrate that Hillesum was connected to others. Eva Hoffman writes in her introduction to the diary that it "grew out of the inti- mate experience of an intellectual young woman-it was idiosyncratic, individ- ual, and recognizably modern" (Hillesum, p. vii). With this in mind, even readers who accept Patterson's taxonomy, were they to read Hillesum's diary might decide that Etty's commitment to what she terms an "inner preparation" is not at odds with her claim that when she prays it is "always for others" (both Hillesum, p. 183). Several of the points made so far explain why Patterson positions his study against James Young's Writing and Rewriting the Holocaust.3 Young not only ac- cepts the differences amongst what he terms the "figures and narrative mythoi" (Young, p. 36) that governed the lives of the diarists, but he insists that these dis- tinctions are central to our understanding of diaries and to our estimation of them as historical documents. His interest in the way narrative produces interpretation and how explanations of events may have affected the course of these events them- selves suggests the reciprocal relationship between event and story (teller). Be- cause Young is concerned with the constructed nature of evidence-"the kinds of events, the time and the recording" (Young, p. 25)-surely Hillesum's identity as ture, p. 367. Mary Felstiner cites it as an example of the sort of document that "get[s] valued as a hu- man emblem rather than as historical evidence," in "Charlotte Salomon's Inward-turning Testimony," in Holocaust Remembrance: The Shapes of Memory, ed. by Geoffrey Hartman (Cambridge: Blackwell, 1994), p. 104. 3.

In fact, it is just this sort of focus that troubles Patterson when he criticizes Young for contrasting the diaries of Moshe Flinker and Anne Frank on the basis of language, themes, and preoccupations. For Young, the different experiences of these adolescents led to their differing conclu- sions about what was happening to them. Patterson claims that Young is mainly concerned with "the tainted nature of the testimony" and thus takes "epistemo- logical flight from responsibility" (p. 8). Finally, Young's argument that diaries should not be elevated over all other forms of literature as a truer form of testi- mony conflicts with Patterson's assertion that we should find our way into Holo- caust diaries by "find[ing] our way into our own souls" (p. 9). As I mentioned earlier, the reader may well want to examine more of these diaries. I would suggest that one needs to know more about each diary in order to evaluate Patterson's analyses. We are given very brief quotations from the diaries, generally less than a line, in support of his arguments. While the chapter titles in the book are provocative-for example, "The Measure of Time," "Meaning Un- done," "The Assault on the Feminine"-the reader may have difficulty deciding from the short excerpts whether the diaries emphasize these themes and whether they conform to Patterson's genre definitions. Perhaps because his ideas about what constitutes a Holocaust diary are rigid, Patterson may not have wanted to in- vite us to make our own analyses, even though that process of engagement would offer us a better chance to "find our way into our own souls" and into Along the Edge ofAnnihilation.
