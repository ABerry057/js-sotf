The board of editors has long desired to publish special issues devoted to particular fields within the broad set of disciplines joined together under the rubric of Jewish studies. These special issues are intended to introduce the broad readership of the AJS Review to the range of creativity in the given field. Our first such special issue focuses on the related fields of Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism, a field in which creative and diversified research has been underway both in the United States and elsewhere in the world of Jewish scholarship, particularly in the State of Israel. The articles presented in the first special number of the review cover a broad range of time periods and issues. They represent the work of a variety of scholars working in various parts of this country and in the State of Israel. Special appreciation for work on this collection of essays goes to Professors Seymour Feldman and Alfred Ivry. It is hoped that this will be merely the first in a series of such coherent collections of studies. We welcome responses to the notion in general and suggestions for other fields for which such special numbers might be appropriate. The Board of Editors Publication of this volume of AJS Review has been made possible by grants from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, the S. H. and Helen R. Scheuer Family Foundation, and the Dorot Foundation. The Association is grateful for their support and encouragement.</page></plain_text>
