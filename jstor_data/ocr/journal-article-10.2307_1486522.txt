<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY "FOOLS FOR LOVE OF THE REPUBLIC"? by VICKI CARON Pierre Birnbaum. The Jews of the Republic: A Political History of State Jews in France from Gambetta to Vichy. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996. 449 pp. This English translation of Pierre Birnbaum's seminal work, Les Fous de la Republique: Histoire Politique des Juifs d'Etat ("The Fools of the Republic: A Political History of State Jews" [Paris, 1992]), constitutes an important contribution to two themes that have dominated the study of modem French Jewry: the nature of Franco-Jewish assimilation, and the character and function of antisemitism. Ever since the publication of Michael R. Marrus's important book, The Politics of Assimilation (Oxford, 1971), which argued that the majority of nineteenth-century French Jews submerged their particularist Jewish identities in favor of a more universal French republican identity, French Jews have been depicted as the most highly assimilated of all European Jews. Birnbaum's study, which draws on a rich array of previously untapped sources, and most innovatively on the administrative dossiers of 171 Jews who held civil and military posts under the Third Republic (1871-1940), reveals, however, that the integration of Jews into French society was a far more complex process than Marrus suggested. To be sure, according to Birnbaum, there were some Jews who endeavored to efface completely their Jewish identities in favor of the universalist and rationalist values associated with the French Revolution of 1789, and especially with the Third Republic. As the radical secularist and free-thinker Paul Grunebaum-Ballin declared when confronted with the antisemitic legislation of the Vichy regime: "I refuse categorically to consider AJS Review 24/1 (1999): 101-109 101</page><page sequence="2">102 VICKI CARON myself a French Israelite, a French Jew. I am a Frenchman who is not of the Jewish race because there is no Jewish race .... Nor am I a Jew by religion, for I am detached from any religious belief or practice, Jewish or otherwise" (pp. 59-60). Such radical assimilation was not, however, the path followed by the majority of French Jews. Rather, according to Birnbaum, it was precisely because the French state, in sharp contrast to its Central European counterparts, did not require its civil and military servants to adhere to one or another of the Christian denominations, that French Jews were able to eschew the most radical brand of assimilation, conversion. Instead, the majority of state Jews opted for a more moderate form of accommodation that balanced a continued Jewish identity with a firm commitment to universal republican values. Indeed, it was the secular ideology of the French state, and especially the Third Republic, which relegated religion entirely to the private sphere and insisted on the principle of careers open to talent, that permitted these Jewish functionaries to remain Jewish while assuming their public duties. Thus, although French Jews did articulate an ideology known as Franco-Judaism, which stressed the ethical and universalistic aspects of Judaism, which in turn were identified with the values of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, this ideology never entailed the complete negation of Judaism. Rather, the majority of Jews continued to believe that Jews had a special mission to spread the secular messianic ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity. But while the ideology of Franco-Judaism has received close historical scrutiny, Birnbaum, as a sociologist, examines the behavior of these state Jews as well, and here, too, he shows that Franco-Judaism by no means implied a negation of Jewish identity for the vast majority of them. While some state Jews disaffiliated with the Jewish community, the majority remained active in Jewish communal life. As Birnbaum's close reading of the Jewish press from this period shows, the state Jews nearly always married Jewish women, retained their biblical names, had Jewish religious burials, and, most significantly, played leading roles in the Jewish community, frequently serving as officers of the Central Consistory and the Alliance Israelite Universelle. Furthermore, they continued to move in predominantly Jewish social networks made up largely of other state Jews. They vacationed together, married into each other's families, and helped one another with job recommendations. Finally, Birnbaum illustrates that the tradition of state service was frequently passed along in families; one can therefore speak of veritable Jewish dynasties</page><page sequence="3">"FOOLS FOR LOVE OF THE REPUBLIC" 103 of state Jews, such as the Reinachs, the Bedarrides, the Hendlks, the Vidal- Naquets, and the Weillers, to name but a few. Although the public and private lives of the state Jews clearly overlapped, Birnbaum insists that most never felt a great tension between these two aspects of their identities. Indeed, even the most ardently secular of them generally took pride in their Jewish backgrounds. As the anarchist and radical deist Alfred Naquet admitted toward the end of his life: "We feel Jewish when Jews are attacked, and we declare it proudly" (p. 84). In addition to examining the complexities of assimilation, Bimbaum also tells us a great deal about French antisemitism, and he shows that the antisemitic movement in France was distinctive in that it continued to exhibit a strong clerical cast. Although Bimbaum views this clerical antisemitism as traditional rather than modem, his evidence clearly suggests that this was not the case. Rather, the chief theoreticians of right-wing nationalism and antisemitism at the end of the nineteenth century-Edouard Drumont, Maurice Barres, and Charles Maurras--made France's Catholic identity the centerpiece of their organic brand of French national identity, and in so doing they created a distinctly modem political movement. Not surprisingly, a principal strand of this antisemitism was the charge that Jews played a disproportionate role in the anti-clerical battles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although Bimbaum clearly feels that the charge is unwarranted, claiming that the role of Jews in these struggles was relatively minimal, his evidence once again suggests a more complicated picture. While Jews were by no means the sole leaders of the anti-clerical campaigns, a number of state Jews, such as Alfred Naquet, Camille See, Camille Dreyfus, Ernest Hendle, Georges Weill, and Paul Grunebaum-Ballin, played prominent roles in the anti-clerical struggle and were even responsible for framing several key pieces of anti-clerical legislation, such as the 1884 divorce law and the 1905 law mandating the separation of church and state. Hence, this particular antisemitic charge was based on a grain of truth. That most of these Jews had tenuous ties with the Jewish community, as Bimbaum notes, was of little consequence to French antisemites, who seized on their role to depict the Third Republic as a Jewish-Masonic cabal. There can be no doubt, however, that Birnbaum's most surprising finding with respect to antisemitism is that the bureaucracy of the Third Republic, despite its anti-clerical tendencies and its supposedly firm commitment to the equality of all individuals before the law, continued to note the religious identities of appointees to civil and military posts in its administrative dossiers.</page><page sequence="4">104 VICKI CARON Although the religious identities of all state officials was noted, Birnbaum insists that the bureaucracy paid special attention to Jews. Nearly always, the religious identity of the wives of Jewish appointees was noted, although this was not the case for either Catholics or Protestants. Moreover, these annotations were frequently tinged with antisemitism. One Jewish official was described as being "of Jewish origin but without the Jewish mind" (p. 43), while a Jewish army officer, although praised for his intelligence and diligence, was also said to possess "the faults of his race" (p. 50). In response to this startling discovery, Birnbaum appropriately asks: "Did antisemitic feelings, surprisingly, figure at the very heart of the republican state with which the Jews were madly in love? This state, almost alone in the world at the time . .., made possible the political integration of Jews ... by means of meritocratic promotion, to the highest careers in the administrative apparatus; did it nonetheless present something like a hidden face?" (p. 320). Despite the extraordinary richness of Birnbaum's analysis, and the sub- stantial amount of new information he brings to bear on our knowledge of modem French Jewish life, there are nevertheless several problems with his account. First, his attempt to draw a dichotomy between court Jews, who, he claims, continued to exercise influence through the Second Empire, and state Jews, who dominated thereafter, is a bit too pat. France, unlike most Central European states, never had a strong tradition of court Jews, and to use the term "court Jew" to refer to any Jew involved in large-scale commerce constitutes a misuse of the term. Moreover, although a small number of Jews did enter state service after 1871, the vast majority remained heavily concentrated in commerce, and this shift was therefore not as radical as Birnbaum suggests. More significantly, Birnbaum's account is characterized by a strong teleological thrust which to some extent distorts the experience of French Jewry. Time and again, while discussing events in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Birnbaum anticipates the Vichy regime, and he suggests that the state Jews were not "only fools for love of the republic" but fools for having devoted themselves so passionately to a state that ultimately turned its back on them. Thus, in his discussion of the notoriously antisemitic Henry Memorial during the Dreyfus Affair, Bimbaum writes: "As if, forty years in advance, the intellectual conditions for the tragedy that the Jews under Vichy would experience had already come together, their destiny already sealed in the consciousness of a large portion of their fellow citizens" (p. 152). Moreover, of the Jewish generals who served France in World War I, Birnbaum notes that they would have found their fate under Vichy inconceivable. While</page><page sequence="5">"FOOLS FOR LOVE OF THE REPUBLIC" 105 this statement is true, it nevertheless implies the inevitability of Vichy's antisemitic legislation, which, for the first time since 1791, stripped French Jews of their emancipation. This teleological aspect is further reinforced by the fact that Birnbaum concludes his book with a discussion of the tragedy of the state Jews under Vichy. While few would deny that Vichy did constitute the blackest period for French Jewry, the enormous success experienced by many state Jews during the Fourth and Fifth Republics, as exemplified by the careers of Ren6 Cassin, Michel Debr6, Pierre Mendes France, Robert Badinter, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, suggests a far more optimistic reading of Franco-Jewish integration than Bimbaum offers here. Also problematic is Birnbaum's assertion that the antisemitism of the Vichy regime grew directly out of the exclusionary tendencies of the Third Republic. He even entitles his conclusion "The Two Faces of the Republic." Yet the evidence Birnbaum adduces to prove this point is far from conclusive. Although the administration of the Third Republic did note the religious backgrounds of candidates for state positions, this information was rarely used to discriminate against these individuals. While some state Jews may not have advanced as quickly up the career ladder as their Christian counterparts, the fact is that few of them suffered any long-term harm as a result of state discrimination. Of the Jewish general who was described as possessing the "faults of his race," Birnbaum notes that he was ultimately promoted to the highest military rank. Of another Jewish appointee, the subprefect Charles Isaac, his superior noted in 1888 that Isaac's "religion is in itself an obstacle to his being sent into a clerical Catholic department like the Nord." Yet Isaac was ultimately sent to this post, despite his Jewish background. Most frequently, as Isaac's case suggests, state administrators were afraid that sending Jewish officials to intensely conservative regions like the Nord or Brittany could provoke a popular backlash and diminish the authority of these officials, a fear that made a good deal of sense, since, as Birnbaum shows, Jews who ran for public office or received civil service appointments in these regions invariably faced virulent antisemitic campaigns. What is truly amazing in Birnbaum's story is the phenomenal success of these Jewish officials despite the groundswell of popular antisemitism, a trend suggesting that secular republicanism had as much if not more popular support than right-wing nationalism. Nor does Birnbaum's evidence support his contention that the Third Republic deliberately scapegoated Jewish officials by placing them in untenable positions and thus making them lightning rods for popular discontent that would otherwise have been focused on the republic itself.</page><page sequence="6">106 VICKI CARON Those Jews who advanced controversial policies did so voluntarily, and had the Republic prevented them from assuming problematic posts, it would have been guilty of the anti-Jewish discrimination Bimbaum so derides. Hence, in the end it seems grossly unfair to blame the anti-Jewish policies of Vichy on the Third Republic. A far stronger case can be made that Vichy antisemitism was part and parcel of a broader anti-republican agenda, which began to garner strength during the Boulanger Crisis and the Dreyfus Affair, intensified during the 1930s, but reached its apogee only during Petain's National Revolution. Perhaps the most problematic aspect of Birnbaum's discussion is his final chapter on the role of the state Jews under Vichy. On the one hand, the chapter is incredibly moving, and it conveys a far more positive picture of native French Jewish behavior than any previous study to date. By citing numerous letters written to Petain personally by native French Jews, Birnbaum shows that the majority of them did not seek personal exemptions from Vichy's antisemitic legislation, and that many were prepared to defend Jewish civil rights with exceptional vigor, thus belying the oft-repeated charges of political passivity. Max Hymans, deputy of Indre, thus explained to Petain that he would bear his new status "without shame," and he added: "How distressed my grandfather would be if he were here to see those of his descendants who were not killed in action and who were all, or almost all, wounded, cited, decorated with the medaille militaire or the Legion of Honor, today reduced to second-class Frenchmen" (p. 351). And, in what is perhaps the most poignant of these letters, Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Dreyfuss declined to accept his nomination into the Legion of Honor in June 1942. Pointing out the extraordinary hypocrisy of the state, Dreyfuss asked how it was possible to "be allowed into the order of the Legion of Honor by a government that at the same time declares me unworthy to serve France as a soldier, by a government that seems to place the downfall, the despoiling, the humiliation of French Jews at the forefront of the spiritual and moral principles of the 'National Revolution."' If he were ever to enter the Legion of Honor, Dreyfuss declared, he would do so only "on a perfectly equal footing with my comrades in war. Before that day, I will have to become once more a Frenchman among Frenchmen" (pp. 51, 341-342). Yet whether all these Jews behaved as honorably as Birnbaum suggests, and whether they were all besotted by love of the Republic, is by no means clear. First, as Birnbaum himself notes, many of the Jewish parliamentarians who feature so prominently in his account actually voted full powers to Petain</page><page sequence="7">"FOOLS FOR LOVE OF THE REPUBLIC" 107 in June 1940, casting a shadow of doubt over their republican sympathies. And, in fact, many of them were deeply conservative. Moise Levy, senator of the Haute-Sa6ne, was well known for his anti-immigrant views, and he even sponsored several bills in the late 1930s to tighten up naturalization procedures and to strip even naturalized citizens of their rights. Another Jewish parliamentarian, Max Hymans, was not a socialist, as Birnbaum at one point claims, but a neo-socialist, a member of a dissident faction that had broken with the Socialist Party in the early 1930s, and whose followers, like Marcel Deat, had, by 1940, veered toward the extreme right. In reality, the political affiliations of many of the state Jews were far closer to the views of the right-wing authoritarian leader, Colonel Francois de La Rocque, than to those of Leon Blum and the Popular Front. Nor is it an accident that from 1934 to 1936 the Central Consistory, whose vice president at the time was none other than Jacques Helbronner, whom Birnbaum hails as the "the final incarnation of Franco-Judaism" (p. 370), repeatedly invited La Rocque, the head of Croix de Feu, a paramilitary organization, to preside over its annual synagogue commemoration for Jewish war dead. Only in the wake of protests from a large segment of the Paris Jewish community did the Consistory finally halt this practice. Moreover in 1941, as Birnbaum notes, Helbronner, who was now serving as president of the Central Consistory, and whose ties to Petain were so close that he was referred to as "the marshal's Jew" (p. 361), even suggested that a Jewish representative be placed on the executive board of the Legion Franqaise des combattants, Vichy's veterans organization, which later devoted itself to rooting out communists and resisters. In truth, the political sympathies of many of the state Jews lauded as heroes by Birnbaum were so far to the right that many of them would have gladly supported Vichy had the regime refrained from carrying out its anti-Jewish program. Similarly problematic is Birnbaum's decision to depict as an act of resistance the Central Consistory's refusal in the fall of 1941 to participate in the Union Generale des Israelites de France (UGIF), the newly created French Jewish Council. As Richard I. Cohen has shown in The Burden of Conscience: French Jewry s Response to the Holocaust (Bloomington, Ind., 1987), a book curiously not cited by Birnbaum, those Jewish leaders who participated in the creation of the UGIF, and especially Raymond-Raoul Lambert, felt they had little choice, since it offered the sole avenue for the provision of relief to foreign Jews, the majority of whom were living in horrendous conditions in Vichy internment camps. Moreover, the creation of the UGIF was a German and not a French decision, contrary to Birnbaum's account, and Xavier Vallat,</page><page sequence="8">108 VICKI CARON Vichy's commissioner general for Jewish affairs, made it crystal-clear to Jewish leaders that if they refused to cooperate in this organization, he would have no choice but to appoint eight "margoulins," or shysters from outside the Jewish community, a situation that would have had dire consequences for France's foreign Jewish population. As Birnbaum reluctantly acknowledges, the real reason for the Consistory's refusal to participate was that it resented the lumping together of French and foreign Jews into a single "Jewish herd" (p. 363), and Lambert, secretary-general of the UGIF and a longtime opponent of Helbronner's refugee policies, was on target when he said of Helbronner that "the fate of foreigners does not in the slightest move him" (p. 367). Indeed, from 1933 to 1935, Helbronner had lobbied the government to close the borders to Jewish refugees from Germany, whom he referred to as "the riff-raff, the rejects of society, the elements who could not possibly have been of any use to their own country."' Nor is there any support for Birnbaum's assertion that there was scant difference between the respective attitudes of the Consistory and the UGIF with regard to foreign Jews. Once again, Richard Cohen's study of the UGIF, as well as his annotated edition of Lambert's wartime diary,2 flatly contradict this assertion. In the end, those state Jews who felt betrayed by Vichy may well have been "fools of the state," but not all of them were "fools for love of the republic." To the extent that Jews like Helbronner should be considered fools at all, it is only because some of them had ceased to love the republic by 1940 and were ready to pin their hopes on a right-wing authoritarian regime. Ironically, the voices of those Jews who remained faithful to the republic throughout these dark years--Leon Blum, Salomon Grumbach, Jules Moch, Pierre Mendes France, and Jean Pierre Bloch, to name but a few-are not represented here at all, since the majority of them were either in exile or had been thrown into prison. To liken their resistance activities to the behavior of Jews like Helbronner, Pierre Maase, or General Pierre Boris, who were prepared to support Vichy fully, at least until the proclamation of the Statut des Juifs, seems to me a travesty of what it meant to have been a "resistor from the first hour." Similarly, Birnbaum's comparison of Helbronner to a state Jew like Isafe Levaillant, who, as editor-in-chief of the Univers israelite at the time of the Dreyfus Affair, called on Jews to band together 1.

Lambert, Carnet d'un timoin, 1940-1943 (Paris, 1985).</page><page sequence="9">"FOOLS FOR LOVE OF THE REPUBLIC" 109 to fight antisemitism, would almost certainly cause Levaillant, as well as his grandson, Henry Torres, the great defense lawyer of the interwar years and an ardent spokesman for Jewish rights, to turn in their graves. In sharp contrast to Helbronner, who denied that Judaism had an ethnic dimension, and who firmly believed that antisemitism had to be combated through quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy, Levaillant and Torres both insisted that Jews as a people, and not merely a religious group, needed to fight antisemitism in a vigorous and public fashion. These problems notwithstanding, this book remains a major contribution to our understanding of the French Jewish experience. By examining numerous sources not previously tapped by Jewish historians, and especially the admin- istrative dossiers of state Jews, Birnbaum has greatly expanded the scope of what constitutes the proper terrain of Jewish history. Moreover, by exploring the dynamic interplay between the private and public worlds of the Jewish civil servants, Birnbaum has greatly enriched our understanding not only of Jewish history, but of French political and social history, and has proven that the two spheres can no longer be treated as discrete entities. Finally, even if one disagrees with some of Birnbaum's views, his book remains so informative and so suggestive of new approaches to the study of Jewish history that it cannot be ignored. Despite occasional awkward constructions, and the failure to include some explanatory notes that would have made this book more accessible to an Anglo-American audience, Stanford University Press is to be commended for having brought out this English translation of Birnbaum's immensely provocative study.
