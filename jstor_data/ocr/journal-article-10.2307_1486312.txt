<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING MEDIEVAL HEBREW LOVE POETRY by NEAL KOZODOY Commentary Magazine In a work of moral philosophy which first appeared in the year 1168, Moses Maimonides finds that human speech, when considered from the standpoint of religion, is divisible into five categories: the prescribed; the cautioned-against or prohibited; the rejected; the desired; and the permitted. For each classification he provides appropriate examples, then he stops to observe a difficulty that may seemingly be posed for this entire scheme by one highly particular form of speech, which is poetry. Maimonides begins to resolve the difficulty as follows: Know that poetical compositions, in whichever language they may be, should be examined with regard to their themes in order to determine whether they follow a manner of speech which we classified. Indeed, I explain this even though it is clear, inasmuch as I have seen elders and saintly men of our co- religionists when they are at a wine banquet, such as a wedding or some other occasion, and were a man to wish to recite an Arabic poem, even if the theme of that poem were the praise of courage or generosity, of the category of the desired, or the praises of wine, of the category of the permitted, they would protest it with every manner of protest, for in their opinion it is not permitted to listen to it. However, were the bard to recite any manner of Hebrew poem, they would not protest it, and it would not be evil in their sight despite there 111</page><page sequence="2">112 NEAL KOZODOY being in those words themes that pertain to the categories of the cautioned- against or the rejected.' The "wine banquet" to which Maimonides refers would presumably be a celebration connected either directly or indirectly with a religious event or ceremony, such as a wedding. But why should the elders and saintly men, as Maimonides (with a hint of derision) calls them, protest the recitation of Arabic poetry? The answer must be that they would regard the Arabic language itself as out of place, vulgar, perhaps even blasphemous, and cer- tainly inappropriate to a semi-religious or quasi-religious occasion. The recitation of poems in the Hebrew language, by contrast, would in their view be permissible no matter what the particular sentiments being expressed, on the grounds that the language itself is sacred, and, being sacred, purifies and exalts that which is expressed in its syllables. The language, they would say, is an elevating and dignifying force; by its inherent sublimity it sacralizes the lowliest of subject matters. Maimonides has no use for this view, so stated. He goes on: This is utter folly, since speech shall be neither forbidden, nor permitted, nor desired, nor rejected, nor prescribed in its utterance from the standpoint of the language utilized, but from the standpoint of the subject. For if the theme of that poem were virtue, it would be required to recite it in whichever language it may be. If, however, the purpose of that poem were vice, in whichever language it may be it is prohibited to recite it. For Maimonides, it would appear, substance is all, form nothing. Would it be his contention, then, that languages are all more or less equal, and all equally neutral-mere vehicles of sentiments which may in their turn be commendable or reprehensible or simply tolerable? Not at all. Maimonides, in fact, shares the view of the elders and saintly men that Hebrew is a par- ticularly exalted tongue. Precisely for that reason, he next proceeds to argue, it must be guarded carefully from debasement. I have an addendum pertaining to this. For were there two poems, both having the same theme-arousing the power of lust, praising it, and causing the soul to rejoice in it-it is vice, and it is of the category of rejected speech because it 1.

However, were one of the two poems Hebrew, and the other Arabic or some other non-Hebrew language, listening to the Hebrew and articulating it would be more objectionable ac- cording to the Law due to the exaltedness of the language, for it should only be utilized for noble purposes. Maimonides' addendum is rather a serious qualification. He concurs with the elders and saintly men in their judgment of the peculiar status of the Hebrew language; in fact he far outstrips them in his valuation of its lof- tiness, so far indeed that he reaches a conclusion precisely opposed to theirs. An exalted tongue, Hebrew must not be frivolously or basely employed; it must be reserved for the poetic expression of thoughts tending to "noble purposes."2 "Certainly," Maimonides concludes his addendum, its use would be prohibited in a poem in which had been inserted verses from the Torah or from the Song of Songs. For then it departs from the category of the rejected to the category of the prohibited and the cautioned- against, for the Law prohibits making the words of prophecy into forms of songs dealing with vices and unseemly matters. By a lengthy and not altogether subtle procedure Maimonides has thus enlarged his critique of the uses of poetic speech in order to establish it, at least with regard to Hebrew poetic speech, on formal as well as on substan- tive grounds; he had begun his critique by rejecting the formalistic argument altogether. But the reference to the Song of Songs, taken together with the prior derogation of poems aimed at "arousing the power of lust, praising it, and causing the soul to rejoice in it," clarifies at last the real object of attack in this extended passage: love lyrics. And not merely love lyrics, but lyrics which in speaking of the love of flesh for lowly flesh, do so unabashedly in the cadences, the terms, the phrases, indeed the very same holy "words of prophecy" that properly describe the love of the people Israel for God, and the love of God for His people Israel. 2.

This was the courtier class of Andalusian Jewry, whose relationship to the "words of prophecy," as Maimonides calls the text of the Bible, colored every single aspect of its collective life-shaping its characteristic modes of thought, defining the vocabulary and rhetoric of its doctrines, providing even the stuff of its historical dreams and ambitions. The society in which the Andalusian courtier fulfilled his function, as a courtier, was a Muslim society. The culture in which he, like the Muslim Arabs around him, participated was in large measure the culture of ancient and Hellenistic Greece, in the forms and with the myriad modifications that had accreted to it in the course of the centuries.3 But adding to, cutting across, and in some cases integrating these disparate aspects of his life was the consciousness, fiercely held by the courtier, of yet a separate cultural identity and yet a separate class affiliation. What, by way of intellectual predilection, did the Jewish courtier of An- dalusia owe to the Greeks? A taste for metaphysical speculation, a passion for unitary systems of thought, for abstract formulations arrived at by the ratiocinative process and directly applicable to an understanding of the physical world, for the wisdom-and for the forms of knowledge, too, for "science"--that is reachable through human thought alone rather than by way of faith, through reason rather than through revelation. As for the specific ideas themselves, and the modes in which they were formulated, some of these were Aristotelian, but at least until the middle of the twelfth century more were Platonic, or rather neo-Platonic. Naturally the Platonic system found the greater number of admirers among those, perhaps the more religion-minded, who saw how it lent itself to formal discussions of the ideal and of the way in which the ideal may be known by the resemblance to it of real objects; and to discussions, in precisely these terms, of love. In this connection the courtier may well have been drawn to notice the high poten- tiality of spiritual ennoblement which for Plato inheres in the search for uni- versal values that begins in affection for a young boy.4 3. The classical "library" available to the Arabic-speaking world in this period is catalogued in Richard Walzer, Greek into Arabic (Oxford, 1962). 4. The text in Plato is the Symposium. Saadia Gaon renders a judgment on this repulsive subject, as he calls it, in 10:7 of his Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans. Samuel Rosenblatt (New Haven, 1948), pp. 373ff.</page><page sequence="5">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 115 To the Arabs, in whose language the courtier learned almost everything he knew of "Greek wisdom," and largely through whose interpretations and commentaries he understood it, the courtier owed his passion for linguistic and rhetorical purity, his allegiance to formal elegance in expression, his principles of aesthetic excellence. The major literary embodiment of this passion is the poetry that the courtier wrote, and heard recited, and read; and it was from the Arabs that the courtier took, not his language itself but the forms, the various styles, even some of the subjects and ideas and images, of his poetry. Among these forms was the love lyric, addressed to a young boy, or sometimes to a young girl.5 "... In you are combined the graces and discernment," writes Moses ibn Ezra, turning in a couplet to flatter a fellow courtier, "as the warp is entwined with the woof./ The Greeks yield to your knowledge of the heavens/ And the Arabs to the purity of your tongue."6 The courtier himself, this is as much to say, was conscious of the diverse cultural strands on which he drew, and in what the essence of each consisted. But what is striking about this couplet is not the cultural self-understanding it reveals, but the really unique identity which translation, at least, conceals. For the sentiment is expressed in the purest classical Hebrew, intelligible neither to Muslim nor to Greek; therein lie the heart and wit of the compliment. The courtier's true excellence-the excellence before which both Greek and Arab must finally bend the knee-is assumed, and then demonstrated, through being formulated in the ancient and sublime language of the Bible. At his spiritual core the courtier was bibliocentric. If from the Greeks he took his philosophy, from the Arabs his rhetorical forms, he took from the Bible the knowledge of who he truly was. The Bible supplied the great figures, the types, the models of perfection-Joseph, Moses, Aaron, David-by which all excellence, the courtier's own emphatically included, was henceforth to be tested and proved. It supplied, in addition, the models of history itself, those patterns of the past in terms of which all present times were to be described and understood, the core experiences-of chosenness, enslavement, exodus, revelation, sovereignty, exile, redemption-together with the chronicles and narratives pertaining to them, which were the 5. Such poems exist by the score, the best of them in the work of Moses ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi.

The Bible reached into history, it influenced history, and of course it influenced attitudes toward history. The record of a people's encounter with the divine, it itself partook of the sanctity of revelation, and hence of revelation's continuousness. It demanded to be appropriated, actively, in every generation; as far as the courtier was concerned, living in extraor- dinary times of cultural revival, perhaps (some thought) at the very edge of historical time, it demanded nothing short of reenactment. And thus it was that the courtier became, as the poets told him he was, a "scion of the house of David . . . a prince of his people providentially delegated to serve as a guarantor of the approaching redemption."8 For this supreme role neither Greek paideia nor Arab art provided sufficient guidance, or warrant of any kind. The courtier looked to the Bible for historical self-definition, and in so doing he appropriated it, a living thing, into his own life; including, for the courtier who wrote poetry, or who was a patron of poets, his life in literature. If the personages of the Bible, and the narratives of the Bible, were alive and active in his mind, forever recalling him to the impossible perfections of his past, the words themselves of the Bible were no less so. Gershom Scholem has spoken of the peculiar attitude of the medieval kab- balists to the Hebrew language (peculiar in that it was not, like the attitude of most mystics to language, a negative one, but the contrary), and something of that attitude was held by the medieval Hebrew poets as well: Hebrew, the holy tongue, is to the mystic not simply a means of expressing cer- tain thoughts, born out of a certain convention and having a purely conven- tional character, in accordance with the theory of language dominant in the Middle Ages. Language in its purest form, that is, Hebrew ... reflects the fun- damental spiritual nature of the world. . . . Speech returns to God because it comes from God.9 7. This discussion of the place of the Bible in the mental universe of the Andalusian Jewish courtier owes much to Gerson D. Cohen, "The Typology of the Rabbinate," in his edition of Sefer ha-Qabbalah by Abraham ibn Daud (Philadelphia, 1967), pp. 263-303. 8. Yitzhak Baer, A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, trans.

For the kabbalist, Scholem notes (he might as easily have said for the philosopher, and the poet), Torah "does not consist merely of chapters, phrases, and words. .. . It is not merely the historical Law of the Chosen People, although it is that too; it is rather the cosmic law of the universe, as God's wisdom conceived it." From this very sweeping view of the powers of the word it follows that the sacred words of the Bible contain a multiplicity, if not an infinity, of possible significances, for "the thoughts of God, in contrast to those of man, are of infinite profundity."'0 For the mystic, or the philosopher, the principle of the manifold mean- ings of the Torah would in practice reduce itself to the dualist principle of an outward meaning, the literal sense of the words, and an inward meaning, equivalent to philosophical allegory. Or exegesis of the Bible might yield, for purposes of greater systematization, four major levels of meaning-the literal, the allegorical, the aggadic, the mystical." The Hebrew poet on the other hand would be unlikely to regard the Torah in quite so mechanical a fashion, and would certainly be unlikely to look in it primarily for philosophical ideas. The poet regarded the Bible also as an aesthetic model, valid for all time. The Bible was an inextricable part of his mental life; it was second nature to his art. He looked to it constantly, and he incorporated it bodily-its phrases, its grammatical forms, its diction, its imagery, its characteristic attitudes and patterns of thought-into his poetry, charging the lines of verse with the electric potency of the sacred text. In one important sense, the poet's relation to the Bible may be called an exegetical one. But the exegesis was reciprocal. For the major effect of the poet's biblicizing tendency was the creation of a sense of multiple and simultaneous meanings hovering over, or arising from, the plain meaning of his words. Whether he wrote devotional hymns, narrative epic, epistolary verse, or lyrics and songs of any kind, the poet who thus soaked his lines in the locutions of the Bible was engaged with his audience in a tremendous 10. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 14. 11. This was of course the scheme favored by the mystics themselves. See Louis Ginzberg, "Allegorical Interpretation of Scripture," included in his On Jewish Law and Lore (Philadelphia, 1955), p. 144, and Gershom G. Scholem, "The Meaning of the Torah in Jewish Mysticism," On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York, 1965), especially pp. 50ff. For an interesting imaginative application of similar principles of exegesis, by the greatest of Christian poets, see Dante's analysis of the verse from Psalms 114, "When Israel went out of Egypt," in his Tenth Epistle to Can Grande della Scala. In the same letter, Dante explains the applicability of such principles to his own poetry; in the Convivio and On the Vulgar Tongue, to poetry in general.</page><page sequence="8">118 NEAL KOZODOY project: the recapturing through language of the historical experience of his people.'2 That is why, in even the most intensely individual of Hebrew lyrics, the personal side will seem strangely muted, unfelt. Only with utmost dif- ficulty, by suppressing everything but the plain meaning, can the reader un- derstand the "I" of a medieval Hebrew lyric as the voice of individual ex- perience alone, or, on the other hand, of the universal experience of mankind. No matter who is said to inhabit the actual world of the poem, the potential world, the world of the sovrasenso, is busy with the claims of a par- ticular people's history and the insinuating compulsions of the divine. III Hebrew literary criticism of the modern period possesses a special term, borrowed from the art of the jeweler, for the device of alluding to the Bible as it was practiced by the medieval poets: inlay, shibbu$. 3 The term has the incidental merit of suggesting another quality of Hebrew poetry in general, the often gem-like hardness and clarity of its diction. But in fact it misses some of the delicacy and intricacy of the allusive method (calling to mind in- stead a quality of fixity), just as it fails to evoke the sinuousness and elasticity of Hebrew poetic style. The term shibbuv encourages a view of the poem as a pavement, studded with any number of those glittering jewels beyond price which the poet has plucked from their biblical context and imbedded in his lines to create a cer- tain ornamental effect. Part of the audience's pleasure in reading or hearing the poem would center on the slight shock that would accompany the 12. As Eliot does in elucidating his notion of the function of "tradition" in the con- sciousness of a poet, the reader must clearly be ready to distinguish when the past is operating as a living thing and when it is mere pedantry and a mechanical show of knowledge. This dis- tinction, which can be made in the reading of any poem, will no doubt be found in turn to in- fluence our judgment of the poem's success or failure in other respects as well. "Tradition and the Individual Talent," in T. S. Eliot, Selected Essays (New York, 1950). 13. The term appears to have been coined by David Yellin as a Hebrew equivalent for the generally accepted Musivstil ("mosaic style"). Yellin's discussion is in his Theory of Spanish Poetry (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1940; 2d ed., 1972), pp. 118ff. See also Dan Pagis, Innovation and Tradition in Secular Poetry (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1976), pp. 70ff., and, for the use of the device in sacred verse, Ezra Fleischer, Hebrew Liturgical Poetry in the Middle Ages (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 103-4. Moses ibn Ezra calls attention to the device in his work of aesthetic theory, Kitab al-Muhadara wal-Mudhdkara, Hebrew translation by Ben-Zion Halper (under the title The Poetry of Israel, Leipzig, 1924), pp. 205-6; Hebrew translation and critical edition by Abraham Halkin (under the title Book of Reflections and Deliberations, Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 297-99.</page><page sequence="9">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 119 recognizing of a locution, utterly familiar to poet and audience alike, placed in an unfamiliar setting-with, perhaps, its original meaning twisted so as to impart a tinge of freshly conceived color or reveal a hitherto unnoticed facet. The poet's formal art thus consisted in part of an ability to set his gems cunningly and well into the surface of his lines, so that their flashing presence positively enhanced the completed work (without overwhelming the beholder altogether by their own brilliance). A biblicizing medieval poet, wishing to visualize in words the device of shibbus, might have turned for illustration to a passage in Exodus which makes use of the root form of the term itself in describing the jewel-inlaid breastplate of Aaron, the High Priest: It was four-square; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span was the breadth thereof, being double. And they set in it four rows of stones: a row of carnelian, topaz, and smaragd was the first row. And the second row, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and an emerald. And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst. And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were inclosed in fittings of gold in their settings.'4 No poet, certainly, would employ allusions in quite so regular or mechanical a way as this, but the passage captures very well the richly varied and full- bodied effect that was the poet's principal rhetorical aim, and it suggests an ideal, one of those biblical models of perfection, toward which a poet might strive. However, in restricting the applicability of the device to the formal side of poetry alone, the term shibbuy fails to do it literary justice. For alluding to a biblical locution utterly familiar to poet and audience alike would have, rather, a dual effect, of which the term shibbus describes only the first part: it would affect one's sense of the poem's form or style, and then it would affect one's sense of the poem's meaning. As for the second effect, which the term shibbu, ignores, it would similarly be divisible. Seeing or hearing an utterly familiar locution in an unfamiliar context would, first, slightly alter one's understanding of the locution itself, especially if the poet used it in a new way: for example, metaphorically where it had always been understood literally, or literally where it had always been understood metaphorically. Part of a poem's indirect function might actually be thus to suggest new in- terpretations of the biblical text-an incidental but significant benefit.'5 But 14. Exodus 39:9-13. 15. See Dan Pagis, Innovation and Tradition, p. 72.</page><page sequence="10">120 NEAL KOZODOY again, the exegesis being performed would be reciprocal. A biblical locution, carrying in its train the almost automatic associations of the entire biblical passage in which it appears and the entire hermeneutical context in which it had traditionally been understood to belong, would in its new incarnation cast subtle and far-ranging effects over all the meanings and significations, both the actual and the possible, of the new-made poem-suggesting, for ex- ample, that what the poet seemed to intend as literal might be understood metaphorically or symbolically, and vice versa. The mere mental act of recall would involve one in such unexpected areas of nuance and implica- tion. The art of inlay is inadequate as an analogy to this method, which needs to be seen as a more delicate and pliable operation. With greater accuracy we might think of the poem as a garment, woven with great skill from costly and colorful material. Into this fabric have been twined threads of pure gold, beaten down from a single golden bar, the Bible; they make their way, into and over and under and around the pattern on the fabric's surface, now dominating the field of color, now submerging altogether to reappear in another quadrant. What is the effect of these scintillating golden threads? They call attention to themselves, first, inviting us to hold up the work, tilting it at a variety of angles and planes in an attempt to perceive whether they might not form some hidden pattern. At the same time, they impart real depth and brilliance to the surfaces surrounding them, and as we study those surfaces we become struck by the impression of motion, as the presence of the pure gold subtly alters the values and intensities of the sur- rounding hues. The gold controls without, finally, dominating; even where it cannot be seen we would tend to find ourselves looking for it. Rather than the breastplate of Aaron, the poem actually bears resemblance to the priestly ephod, a garment whose manufacture is described, in Exodus, in the self-same passage: And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. And they did beat the gold into fine plates, and cut it into threads, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.'6 As the fifteenth-century Italian Hebrew poet, Moses ibn Haviv, proudly observed, the art of allusion as it was practiced by the medieval Poets is a unique art, and it sets their poetry apart from (above, Moses ibn Haviv 16. Exodus 39:2-3.</page><page sequence="11">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 121 would have insisted) any other the world has known.'7 When practiced by a great craftsman, with deftness of touch-"exquisitely fine!"-and keen as- surance of purpose, it produces lines that are tense with tradition, but never ponderous; that lift the weight of history, both human and divine, and dis- tribute it in images of supple and continuous motion; that carry all the mes- sages of time singing in their filaments. The garment of such a poem is as light and as strong and as continuous as Pope's perfect web, and in it the biblical voice (like a spider's touch) "feels at each thread, and lives along the line." IV The allusive method can be seen at work in a brief lyric by Moses ibn Ezra which is itself a seamless pattern of loveliness. The Garden / 7 Pr 9,r niW i / Tio W ngo/ o mnn; The garden dressed in suits of many colors; a woven covering was the clothing of the grass. Each tree wrapped itself in a checkered tunic, and showed its wondrousness to every eye. Each new blossom renewed itself for this season, and emerged laughing to greet its arrival. Now before them passed a rose, a king whose throne was raised on high. It emerged from that which guarded it, and changed its prison garment. He who will not drink his wine to it-that man will bear his own sin.'I 17.

Heinrich Brody's comments on the poem appear in his</page><page sequence="12">122 NEAL KOZODOY The Bible-centeredness of this reverdie is apparent at once, in the con- vention, built partly into the linguistic structure, of personified attributes, and in the assumption that meaning reveals itself through action. The lyric is Bible-centered too in the device it employs of describing the splendors of nature, grass and trees and blossom, in terms of the splendors of art, colored suits and checkered tunics-that characteristic mode of ancient Near Eastern poetry. ("His hands are rods of gold set with beryl, his body is polished ivory overlaid with sapphire." Indeed, the garden itself is an ar- tificial construction, a miniaturized, secure, and carefully ordered rendering of the unpredictable and disorderly "nature" of nature.) But its mental orientation toward biblical modes is in fact all-pervasive, discoverable as much in its narrative procedures and in its images as in its rhetorical conven- tions. The garden is an object beheld, but also the major actor in the poem, performing the entire ritual of spring in graceful mimicry of human practice. Its natural beauty, mute, immobile, enclosed, is wholly describable by reference to human artifact (clothing) and human society (of the monarchical variety) and human conduct. Indeed the implied course of the garden's "progress," in its basic lineaments, is seen as common to nature and man alike, for it is the progress from a state of winter, which is bar- barism, to a state of civilized nobility. The garden presents to the beholder's eye an ideal of natural perfection. This perfection, far from being fixed or static, is a perfection in motion, and a movement within perfection: "dressing," "wrapping," "renewing," "showing" itself to every eye. And we understand that this movement within perfection has itself been made possible by means of a previous movement, and that, as the strong verbal action of the lyric makes unmistakably clear, was a great movement of the will. The spring season in this poem does not simply occur; the garden brings it about, by its own effort, each tree and each blossom undertaking, gladly, its necessary function in the strenuous passage from winter. A jubilant kingdom, but one which they all have created by this effort, awaits them finally, a warm and civilized society in miniature, com- plete with a rose-king freshly emancipated from its freezing wintry prison. Here, in this society, so like an ideal projection of his own, a man might in- Commentary to the Secular Poems of Moses ibn Ezra (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1941), pp. 8-9. David Yellin discusses the poem, Theory of Spanish Poetry, p. 129, as does Dan Pagis (who points out the "royal" theme in it) in The Secular Poetry and Poetic Theory of Moses ibn Ezra and his Contemporaries (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1970), pp. 265-66.</page><page sequence="13">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 123 dulge in condign aristocratic pursuits; indeed, only at his peril would he refuse them. The ideal of natural perfection has thus become by the end an ideal of social perfection. The imagery of the lyric is the imagery of dress, and it helps to reinforce what the narrative movement has suggested, that the process of natural re- juvenation is definable by its similitude to man's rise to civilization in this particular as well: that once, like man, the garden of nature was naked and bare, and that was the winter of its impoverishment, but now it clothes itself royally, in the springtime of its humanity. This imagery recalls us to the Bible. Part of the lyric's power, we observe, lies in the unhesitating boldness of its pictures of dress and undress, and in the self-assured use of the personifying device that gives significance to those pictures through the poem's verbal action. Thus the garden plays out a little drama of redemption-from-servitude in which we can recognize ourselves and in which, by the end, we become explicitly involved. We appreciate this enactment the more when we allow ourselves to become aware of the un- derlying pattern of biblical allusions in the poem. The biblical passages al- luded to in this lyric have to do with kings, princes, priests-the aristocracy of a nation-and several contain prophecies concerning the restoration of the kingdom in the end of days, when an entire people will have passed through a winter of great trial. Within these very passages, we find a connec- tion drawn that is characteristic of the Bible generally: a connection between the idea of enslavement and the idea of nudity on the one hand, and a cor- responding connection between the idea of civilization and freedom and the idea of being richly clothed on the other. A reference in the first line of the lyric to "suits of many colors" straightway invokes by recollection the coat given by the patriarch Jacob to Joseph, his favorite son, in prefigurative token of that status of superiority and chosenness which he would later reveal to the world in becoming vice- regent and powerbroker of Egypt.'9 (Joseph, throughout all tradition the ideal type and model of the noble courtier, in fact hovers suggestively over the entire poem.) The phrase "clothing of the grass" in line one makes use of a rare syntactical construction found in Leviticus in a passage describing the High Priest as he dons the garments that are among the sufficient outward signs of his office: "and the priest shall put on his linen garments"; similarly with the "checkered tunic" in the second line, taken from the "tunic of checkered cloth" which in Exodus describes the priestly raiment.20 19. Genesis 37:3. 20. Leviticus 6:3; Exodus 28:4.</page><page sequence="14">124 NEAL KOZODOY The first two lines thus establish the fitness of the imagery of dress. In donning the garments of spring the garden mimics perennial human con- duct, but its warrant for doing so, its authorization as it were, lies in the specific conduct of a number of historically ideal types. The third and fourth lines are alive with hints from the redemption prophecies of Isaiah and Micah. As the renewed blossoms greet spring they recall another great moment of acclamation: "The nether world from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming.P"21 The silent biblical verse accomplishes two things at once here: it reinforces, in its reference to the underworld, the prevailing picture of an emergence from darkness to light, from the lower to the higher, and it prepares us by anticipation for the triumphant appearance of the rose-king, since the word thee in the biblical original refers in context to the king to whom this prophecy is addressed. The rose-king itself then simply and elegantly reenacts the visionary, mes- sianic verse, "and their king will pass before them, and their Lord at the head of them."22 Without a pause, the unidentified monarch is next compared in the highest to King David himself, type of the redeemer, the man, as the prophet Samuel puts it, "raised on high."23 The lyric voice has said "rose" and then "king," in plain unsupported apposition, and we understand without needing explanation: Western literary history has sanctioned the connection for us. This connection becomes much more intense and inevitable when our mind supplies all the many preexisting patents and epithets of kingship that swarm within the lines of verse themselves. In the fifth line the ceremony of coronation is actualized, as the captive rose emerges from the leaves surrounding and suppressing it and, recalling King Jehoiachin of Judah, exchanges prison garments for its own, properly royal raiment: And it came to pass .. that Evil-merodach the king of Babylon did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison. And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above all the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon. And he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life.24 21. Isaiah 14:9. 22. Micah 2:13. 23. 2 Samuel 23:1. 24. 2 Kings 25:27-30.</page><page sequence="15">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 125 This biblical passage is itself an echo or a reenactment of a previous episode in the long-ago past, the moment in which Pharaoh of Egypt lifted up the head of him whose clothing has been invoked in the lyric's first line. It was at Pharaoh's behest that Joseph was brought "hastily out of the dungeon. and he shaved himself and changed his raiment." And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.. . and they cried before him, Bend the knee ... .25 Thus is the full lineage of the rose-king established, stretching backward and forward in time through a series of interlocking and recapitulating events, each of them involving a release from imprisonment and an arrayal in new clothing. Now some of the larger intentions of this lyric begin to gain clarity. Within the particular area of sacred biblical history bodied forth in the poem, images of dress and undress are intimately tied with ideas of in- dividual and social redemption. In the Bible fine raiment is a distinguishing mark of the civilized man; it is also a mark of the high nobility and the priesthood; but it is specifically the mark of the man, and of the people, that has "changed his prison garments" by a wonderful movement of will, that has left behind a condition of servitude to alien rulers and alien gods and struggled to achieve autonomy and freedom within the terms of the divinely appointed order. The Joseph story, in its preoccupation with just these mat- ters, forges them into a kind of symbolism, sanctioning their interconnec- tion for all time. Speaking through His prophet Ezekiel, the Lord describes the condition of Israel, prior to the covenant at Sinai, as one of utter nakedness; revelation, and the establishment in Palestine of the theocratic kingdom, is the cloaking of a nation: "I clothed thee also with richly woven work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I wound fine linen about thy head, and covered thee with silk ... thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom."'26 This is a true progression from winter to springtime, a veritable exodus; and in celebrating its occurrence all creation might justly participate. The proper relation of the individual to this drama is the subject of the 25. Genesis 41:14, 41-43. 26. Ezekiel 16:10.</page><page sequence="16">126 NEAL KOZODOY final line. It is the unending duty of man to acknowledge and to honor the perfection which expresses itself as it has in the garden, through nature's recapitulation of sacred history. To decline this task, to refuse to raise one's cup to it in sacramental celebration and thanksgiving, is in the plain sense to spurn the natural order of the world-hence to reject man's place in that order. But inexorably the line suggests as well, in culmination of what has gone before, that man's place in the natural order is defined precisely by his acceptance of the obligation to choose freedom over slavery, sealskin and richly woven work over the slack and passive vestments of the dungeon; he signifies his acceptance through a ritual affirmation of his membership in the historic society of Israel. Springtime, finally, marks the time of a people's birth into freedom, and the garden recalls us in the end to the great festival which yearly commemorates the passage of a nation from servitude into redemption. "But the man that is clean, and that is not on a journey, and yet forebeareth to keep the Passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people; because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his ap- pointed time, that man shall bear his sin."27 To absent oneself from this celebration is virtually to deny one's historic identity. Through its interlocking and reinforcing patterns of subliminal allusion this little lyric succeeds in plaiting grand intimations of a redeemed historical order into a celebration of natural renewal in spring, and in its very last line the lyric succeeds in implicating the audience directly in this conjoining of themes. The poem in the end becomes a bit of a holiday sermon, a parable, except that the object lesson it teaches remains forever undemonstrated, hidden away beneath the surface in the hollows of memory, hinted at but never really expounded. From the first word of the first line we have been made aware of an implied cluster of non-literal as- sociations, rooted in historical experience; when we reach the last line, with the high clarity of its reference to the Passover festival-the festival to which, historically, the story of Joseph in Egypt is the necessary prelude- we see with sudden comprehensiveness the relation of that cluster of reminiscences to the present time, the time of which, to which, the lyric literally speaks. The garden, containing within itself the possible history of past redemptions, projects the burden of that history onto the present, dis- charging and reaffirming it at once, performing and urging the continued performance of the ceaselessly relevant duty of recognition and com- memoration. 27. Numbers 9:13.</page><page sequence="17">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 127 V The garden in Moses ibn Ezra's lyric recapitulates a central moment in sacred history; the poetic medium, without the slightest hint of allegoriza- tion, brings this about-deftly exploiting the allusive richnesses that inhere in the "speech that comes from God." The lyric in this sense constitutes a little triumph of significant form, a perfect melding of means to meaning. Triumphs like this are rare enough in literature; no less so, in the par- ticular body of literature under discussion. The whisper of the biblical voice does not always make itself heard with such unitary and stirring effect, nor does the biblical thought always form itself in such an intricately woven pat- tern of significance. Most poems, perhaps, will not achieve the sustained ef- fect of an integrated double consciousness: the lyric subject imagined and fully realized within its own terms, the biblical message enhancing, com- menting upon, extending, aggrandizing the subject in a lively mutuality of sense. In many poems that golden filament, deepening and lending the authority of its antique wealth to the main lyric strand, while simultaneously glowing with the hint of another meaning that is its own, will not be brought into perfect alignment at every point with the pattern on the surface. Far from being integrative, the effect of the gold may then be to produce in- decisiveness and imbalance, as if an accomplished but presumptuous craftsman were attempting to stitch uncut bars of fine, old, heavy metal into a web of spun silk. It is precisely at those times that the entire enterprise of a biblicizing poetry seems most open to question, as we are brought to inquire with each fresh allusion what the ulterior purpose could be of this peculiarly suggestive yet enigmatic form. Especially troublesome in this way are love lyrics. Even in the case of "The Garden" there may have been reason to wonder whether the solemnity of the biblical theme is really appropriately joined, stylistically speaking, to the light and sunny topic that is the poem's principal line. In reading Hebrew love poems we run the risk of being in a constant state of wonder- ment (if not, indeed, dismay) of this kind. As if the pressure were not already sufficiently great in the very notion of a body of work bent upon couching erotic themes in the syllables of the holiest and most awesome tongue known to man, these lyrics, in their continual invocation of the sacred biblical text, dare to pursue an even higher degree of tension: they take the realm of the profane and the realm of the religious, and they boldly intermix them at the point of their utmost fragility, on the question of the value and the direction of love. From this conflation they attempt to fashion a new</page><page sequence="18">128 NEAL KOZODOY double consciousness. We must wonder at every moment, because of the never-ceasing presence of the biblical voice, whether the human love of which any particular poem speaks, not infrequently in a graphic way, is not really meant to do metaphorical duty for the love of God, and whether desire between individuals is not really meant to suggest as well a people's old longing for the divine. If it is true that the "I" of a Hebrew lyric can only with difficulty be understood as the isolated voice of the individual, love lyrics present an especially trying instance of the rule; the most intensely per- sonal of poetic forms, on the most scrupulously personal of topics, takes upon itself an unimaginably heavy weight of potential import. There is in the Hebrew literary tradition a brilliantly successful model for precisely this kind of lyrical poetry, and of course the model is a biblical one. A medieval reciting the erotic verses of the Song of Songs would have simultaneously in mind all the intentions and significations-not just the al- legorical ones-that centuries of exegesis had supplied (although he should hardly be imagined so far to forget himself in them as to ignore the plain meaning of the words). In this monument of an ancient romantic imagina- tion resided a vocabulary which, by the time it came to be utilized in the Middle Ages by the Hebrew lyricist of courtly love, already contained within itself an entire concentration of double, triple, quadruple meanings. Here was the language of human love, but sacralized; it only remained for the exegetical imagination of the medieval poet to take these intimate senti- ments, canonically expressive of Israel's ardor for the divine, and boldly to turn them again to the literal depiction of human desire. The boldness of the enterprise, and the possibly subversive implications of it, are what arouse Moses Maimonides as he locates and attacks what he considers to be the essential program of the love lyric written in Hebrew. He objects, first, to the merest suggestion of a mixture of the high with the low in this most delicate of realms: the interweaving of a sanctified vocabulary of love in a profane literary form, the consequent debasement of the holy. But he fears equally the contrary effect from this adulteration, and perhaps he fears it the more: the elevation of the low, the exaltation of "vice," the glorifying of human sexuality by analogizing it to amor dei. He objects final- ly to a species of romanticism, the urge to find in love a sufficient spiritual career, and to poems that celebrate that urge by "arousing the power of lust, praising it, and causing the soul to rejoice in it." In this connection in particular Maimonides cites the use by lyric poets of verses from the Song of Songs, itself an extreme example-he implicitly acknowledges-of the ingenuity of the hermeneutic, the poetic, mind. The</page><page sequence="19">READING MEDIEVAL LOVE POETRY 129 old argument advanced by the rabbis in behalf of the sacred character of the Song of Songs (for in Maimonides we encounter only the latest chapter in an already lengthy debate) was precisely an argument from allegorical method: the lowly, it was held by them, conceals the sublime.28 And in another con- text Maimonides himself is to maintain that in the blaze of religious il- lumination which is the highest sublimity of all, the lowly in the Song of Songs simply ceases to exist: the phrase, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth," then means nothing but the amatory knowledge of God-a knowledge, moreover, which these words alone express to perfection.29 Love lyric threatens to undo this argument altogether, by stretching it to the breaking point. It is Maimonides' announced view that poets who deliberately inject into their work verses from the "prophets" or the Song of Songs are really attempting to redeem the patent licentiousness of their thought by invoking the authority of Scripture. But he recognizes that the deeper threat offered by this poetry to traditional religious forms rests on a more complicated consideration, for the particular scriptural authority be- ing invoked by the poets is itself an example, the prime example, indeed the ideal type and emblem, of the very process he decries. In love lyric the lowly and the sublime, so laboriously dissociated in the rabbinic exegesis of the Song of Songs, are fused together once again, and the specter thereby raised is of a total inversion of values, a disestablishment, by mockery, of the sub- lime. Flagrantly embezzling and internalizing the long-sanctioned ter- minology of sacred love, Hebrew love lyric achieves a perilous similitude to, becomes, from the literary point of view, almost a worthy continuator of, the only admissible model that exists for judging its pretensions and con- demning them utterly. The subversive potentiality that inheres in this poetry, and before which Maimonides recoils, will become all the greater the more perfectly a poem resembles its biblical model, the more highly spiritualized it is, the more it appears, through the language it has ap- propriated for its expression, to have only noble purposes in mind-the more, in short, it truly succeeds in its intention of causing the soul to rejoice in the power of love. 28.
