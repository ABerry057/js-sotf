Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1989. 101 pp. (English), 99 pp. (Hebrew). The appearance of an important new book, Secundum Salomonem, has brought to light a text that does much to encourage research on the biblical exegetes, both Jewish and Christian, of twelfth- and thirteenth-century France. A joint effort by Sarah Kamin 5"T, a scholar who made important contributions on the exegesis of Rashi and Rashbam, and Avrom Saltman, an expert on medieval Latin texts, Secundum Salomonem presents the student of medieval exegesis with a unique episode in the interaction between Jewish and Christian scholarship. This Latin text,' dated to the second half of the thirteenth century (p. 7), is a paraphrase (and often ver- batim) translation of Rashi's commentary on the Song of Songs. Although the use of Jewish material and particularly the use of Rashi by Christian exegetes is well known,2 this text evinces an approach that is sui generis among Christian Hebraists. 1.

Although many of Halperin's conclusions are open to debate, he does provide a wealth of refer- ence that are indicative of the influence of Jewish exegesis.

The author makes a very conscious and consistent effort to retain the Jewish context of the commentary. This is often achieved by avoiding issues that would bring the Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Song of Songs into conflict (pp. 25-28). For this reason the author follows the outlines of Rashi's explanations of the historical symbolism of the book but stops short of including contemporary events in the historical allegory. By choosing to limit the allegory to events which occurred before the destruction of the Second Temple, the author is able to avoid both Rashi's polemics against Christian missionizing activities and Christian interpretations that would depict the church as the rightful heir and replacement of the synagogue. Additionally, Kamin and Saltman demonstrate the ways in which the author of the commentary transforms the work of Rashi into a work that is consistent with both the language of the Vulgate version and the technical parlance of thirteenth-century Christian theology (pp. 23-25). Beyond this achievement the author also shows great sensitivity to the finer points of Hebrew grammar, Rashi's style, and his frequent use of assonance and paronomasia to explain difficult lexical problems (ibid.). The editors of the book are to be commended for several important con- tributions, not the least of which is making the text available to everyone. There are both Hebrew and English introductions (although the Hebrew introduction is a bit more detailed than the English), the Latin text with excellent notes, and a Hebrew translation of the Latin which is faithful and accurate. The book also contains a full text of Rashi's commentary for easy reference. This, together with the notes in the Hebrew translation, gives the reader a very immediate sense of both the differences and the similarities between the work of Rashi and his Christian translator. From the text and the analysis offered by the editors several challenging facts emerge. This text shows a continued and perhaps even heightened interest in Jewish scholarship during a period in which the use of Jewish sources by Christian exegetes seems to have been waning in many circles. The text also gives clear testimony to the amazingly accurate grasp of Hebrew which the author displays (p. 35). Moreover, one finds many examples in which the author expands the "Jewish" theological content even beyond that which is contained in the original. Such an example is seen in the commentary to Song of Songs 4:3, "Your temples (Vulgate: cheeks) are like the slice of a pomegranate":</page><page sequence="3">A THIRTEENTH CENTURY COMMENTARY ON SONG OF SONGS 195 Rashi: Your temples. This is the highest point of the face ... and it is like the half of a split pomegranate. . . . Our Rabbis explained the allegory: the worth- less people among you are full of precepts as a pomegranate.... Latin Text: Your cheeks .... That is to say, like a pomegranate which is red and full of many seeds. Likewise you are red from circumcision and filled with 613 precepts. (p. 37) In this context it should be noted that in the course of discussing authorship the editors pose the question of whether Secundum Salomonem could be the work of a converted Jew (p. 47). The editors dismiss the possibility on sever- al grounds, but, it should be noted, the strongest evidence against such a possibility is the even-handed treatment of Jewish ideas found in the text. From all that we know of cases in which converted Jews wrote for Latin readers, their tendency was always to denounce Judaism and portray Jewish sources in the most negative ways possible.3 As mentioned, the careful reader will find instance after instance in which the author of the commen- tary makes a conscious effort not to enter into areas in which the allegoriza- tion and typology of the text would place the Jewish and Christian exposi- tions at odds (p. 26). This text is an important statement in the historical development of bib- lical exegesis in its own right. Yet I feel compelled to raise the implicit ques- tions that still call for further study and analysis. What was the exact nature of the influence of Jewish scholarship on the French Christian exegetes? Was there more than a simple search for the Hebraica Veritas?4 Why was it that a scholar such as the author of Secundum Salomonem demonstrates the impor- tance of Jewish scholarship but is unwilling to take a more critical view of the Vulgate text? All of the possible answers that one might, as a result of further study, offer concerning these and other questions must be addressed against the background of an even larger question: what are we to make of the many parallels between the development, goals, and ultimate fates of both Christian and Jewish exegetical scholarship in twelfth- and thirteenth- century France? Are the parallels indicative of common and related con- 3. See, for example, the discussion in Robert Chazan, Daggers of Faith (Berkeley, 1989), pp. 35-36. 4. On the history of this question, see A. Grabois, "The Hebraica Veritas and Jewish- Christian Intellectual Relations in the Twelfth Century," Speculum 50 (1977): 611-634.</page><page sequence="4">196 YAAKOV THOMPSON cerns that spring from a common and shared spirit of the times, or are the parallels only epiphenomena that should be viewed as nothing more than contemporary but independent expressions of the respective groups of exegetes? This question is of particular importance when the rise of peshat exegesis among Jewish scholars of Northern France is being contrasted and compared with the emphasis of Victorine and other scholars on ad litteram exegesis. While even a superficial discussion of the evidence would call for a separate monograph, in the space of this essay I will present some of the questions that must still be addressed. First and foremost we have yet to synthesize two very different bodies of literature on medieval Jewish exe- gesis. At the turn of the century many scholars of the Wissenschaft school edited texts and produced monographs on the Jewish exegetes of Northern France. We owe a great debt to these scholars for preserving texts that would otherwise have disappeared. But we also must begin the task of reviewing their works. Due to the general neglect of the subject, these have, by default, achieved an authoritative status that is only now beginning to be challenged. This material not only must be reviewed and, when necessary, be corrected; it also must be read in the light of trends and developments in current scholarship. This scholarship is twofold: first, there are the many invaluable text editions and monographs that have been produced by those who are sparking a renewed interest in the medievals; and, second, the exegetical agendas, methodologies, and worldview of the pashtanim must be viewed against the background of the recent advances in medieval studies in general. Of particular interest here are the recent volumes on the so-called twelfth-century renaissance.5 A better understanding of this period promises to inform researchers as to the Weltanschauung of those exegetes who were the exponents of peshat exegesis in Northern France. The three generations that extend from Rashi to Yosef Bechor Shor span a period in which dramatic changes were taking place in the medieval mind. Although 5. It is unfortunate that even in recent works that have tried to synthesize the research of the last fifty years concerning the twelfth-century renaissance the issues of Jewish learning and contributions have been ignored. One has only to examine such volumes as L. Benson and G. Constable, eds., Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century (Cambridge, 1982), to see that the evaluation of Jewish intellectual life is conspicuous for its absence. In terms of the type of studies needed, see S. Kamin, "Rashbam's Conception of Creation in Light of the Intellectual Currents of His Time," in Studies in the Bible, ed. S. Japhet (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 91-102.</page><page sequence="5">A THIRTEENTH CENTURY COMMENTARY ON SONG OF SONGS 197 we may not be in a position to make an exact correlation between intellec- tual developments and trends in exegesis, a better understanding of these developments will aid in us evaluating both Jewish and Christian scholar- ship. This method may run the risk of seeing cultural and intellectual influences where none actually existed, but to ignore the help of such com- parative study would be to repeat the mistake of studying exegesis as if it were carried out in an intellectual vacuum. The text presented in Secundum Salomonem reminds us that during the centuries under consideration the goals and methods of Christian and Jewish exegesis often ran along parallel lines. It is the difficult task of the historian of exegesis to plot the course through which these lines at times intersected and at other times diverged.6 The more challenging question is this: how are we to account for the parallels of time and space? Northern France was home to Christians and Jews who developed contextual exegesis at roughly the same time. Both schools emerge suddenly from a background of noncontextual exegesis, stand in full blossom for a brief day, and then give way to a militant return to noncontextual exegesis of various types. This offers much temptation to explain both schools as participants in a mutual (and perhaps reciprocal) expression of the twelfth-century Zeitgeist. Such a view would also see the disappearance of both schools as the result of what one might call an "anti-intellectual" backlash. Conversely, one might claim that the parallels are illusionary, that the similarities are coincidental, and that each school was simply following the natural evolution of its respective methodology and critical approach to the biblical text. The latter approach is too simplistic and seems to exhibit a strong bias against crosscultural influence.7 At this point in time we are only beginning to arrive at the proper questions, and answers seem far away. We do have solid evidence that several important Christian exegetes were influenced by Rashi and other Jews, but as a solitary datum this fact forms a weak foun- dation for any meaningful conclusion. Surely the Jewish impact on Chris- tian scholarship, which started with Origen, never disappeared completely, but rather survived periods of greater or lesser influence. How are we to begin to evaluate what impact, if any, Christian scholars had upon the 6. Cf. the discussion in Y. Thompson, "The Commentary of Samuel ben Meir on the Song of Songs" (D.H.L. diss., Jewish Theological Seminary, 1989), pp. 30-40. 7. On the methodology and importance of viewing documents as expressions of cross- cultural ideas, see Robert Chazan, European Jewry and the First Crusade (Berkeley, 1987).</page><page sequence="6">198 YAAKOV THOMPSON development of Jewish peshat exegesis? Would it be valid to assume a cata- lytic relationship such as the effect that the rise of Karaism had upon the exegesis of Saadia? Opinions vary widely, from those who claim that peshat exegesis is the natural and organic outgrowth of talmudic study to those who claim that peshat is the Jewish reaction to Christian polemics and mis- sionizing. Regardless of which point along this spectrum of thought is actually the closest to historical fact, the many parallels are inescapable and worthy of further study. With the appearance of Secundum Salomonem we have gained an im- portant piece of the puzzle that constitutes the history of biblical exegesis in Northern France during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is a piece that has a beauty all its own, a beauty that deserves a close viewing. Be that as it may, we cannot view this piece without stepping back and realizing that a great number of other pieces must still be put in place before the puzzle is complete.
