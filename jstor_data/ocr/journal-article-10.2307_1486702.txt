<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frederick H. Greenspahn. When Brothers Dwell Together: The Preeminence of Younger Siblings in the Hebrew Bible. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. xi, 193 pp. This book surveys broadly and in depth various sources from the Bible, and from extrabiblical material of Israelite and foreign origin, with the intention of investigating the position of the firstborn and birthright as well as the younger siblings in the framework of the Israelite family during the biblical period. F. E. Greenspahn presents various sources according to which the hegemony in certain families was in the hand of the youngest child rather than in that of the firstborn. The author examines the relevant biblical material, some of which belongs to the judicial area and other to narrative or historiographical sources. An important part of Greenspahn's monograph is occupied by the numerous parallels from different sources included in the book. These parallels have judicial implications, on the one hand, and sociological ones, on the other. This study is based upon narratives, laws, historical material, mythological materials, and the like. The author draws comparisons with various texts from the ancient Near East, talmudic literature, classical sources from Greece and Rome, medieval legend, and the modem era. The outcome of this method is a rich monograph full of very important and interesting details dealing with the main issues of this research. The book opens with a valuable survey of the history of the research on family hegemony. The author mentions, inter alia, J. Jacob's interpretation of the junior's rights in ancient Israelite society as against the common conception of the hegemony of the firstborn. Greenspahn does not accept Jacob's view regarding this issue and seeks a different solution. The bibliography at the end of the book is very rich and no doubt covers most of the items available on the subject. However, the author does not</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 373 actually use all the items in the course of his discussion. Had he done so, he would have given fuller credit to some important and pertinent studies (e.g., see p. 18, n. 30; p. 24, etc.). In the first chapter, the author surveys selected scriptures which describe the hegemony of the firstborn. He also provides some sociological justifi- cations for this situation. He examines the term "I= from various points of view, e.g., for its usage in texts concerning inheritance, transfer of family hegemony, etc. On the basis of this discussion, one can see the importance of the status of those who hold the title 11m. I must state that I cannot accept the author's interpretation regarding the issue of those who hold the title 113. In my opinion, this title belongs to the firstborn alone throughout his entire life, and none of his close relatives, not even his father, was allowed to appoint any other person to hold it in his place. One of the most important texts regarding this issue is 1 Chr 5:1-2: "The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; but because he polluted his father's couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that he is not enrolled in the genealogy according to the birthright, though Judah became strong among his brothers and a prince was from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph." According to this source, Reuben continues to be considered the firstborn of the family and to hold the title i~. This is so even though the privileges of the birthright had already passed to Joseph. There is a further tension between Joseph, who receives the birthright, and Judah, who "became strong among his brothers and a prince was from him." According to this, one may state that the title Ia= cannot be removed from the original firstborn, who is entitled to it as the real and historic firstborn. On the other hand, the privileges of the birthright could have passed to one of the other sons of the family, even if he was not really the firstborn. The complicated situation in 1 Chr 5:1-2 arises from the fact that some of the rights have been given to an additional, third party, namely, Judah. In the case of Hosah of the sons of Merari (1 Chr 26:10-11), it is said: "And Hosah ... had sons: Shimri the chief (wvin), for though he was not the firstborn, his father made him chief; Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third . ." The phrase "his father made him chief (VKni)" clearly refers here to the appointment of one who was not a firstborn to the office of chief; generally speaking "chief"' and "firstborn" apply to the same figure. Thus, the intention of this sentence is to designate Shimri as chief (tKI; i.e., appointed) and not as firstborn (nan; natural). Hence this verse indicates something of the power</page><page sequence="3">374 BOOK REVIEWS that the father had to appoint one of his other sons as heir instead of the firstborn. One may nevertheless infer from this and from other cases that even a firstborn who has been removed from his task as head of his brethren is still called the firstborn (11n): that is, the natural firstborn retains the title of firstborn even in those cases where the title has been emptied of its contents, following the transfer of the privileges of the birthright to another. The case of Hosah and his son Shimri likewise indicates that hegemony and the title of firstborn are not necessarily identical. The verse reads, "Shimri the chief, for though he was not the firstborn, his father made him chief." The comment "though he was not the firstborn" indicates the need felt by the author of these lines to explain why Shimri was made chief despite the fact that this was not the usual practice. Nevertheless, this comment is insufficiently clear, as it does not clearly explain to whom it refers. On the one hand, it may have been intended as general information, stating that there was no firstborn in this particular family for whatever reason: e.g., that the firstborn was a daughter, or that the natural firstborn had died or been deposed, or the like. On the other hand, the comment may refer to Shimri, who is the last person mentioned prior to the appearance of the word "firstborn" in the verse. It seems reasonable to assume that the choice of Shimri for the position of chief was connected with arrangements of birthright. Even before he was appointed chief, Shimri was second to the firstborn, being perhaps the firstborn of another wife of Hosah, etc. Once he was appointed chief of the brothers, he was called chief (ti; "Shimri the chief... his father made him chief') and not firstborn. For all the implications of this case, compare Greenspahn, pp. 60-61, 66, 79.' We turn now to the issue of the preeminence of the younger siblings. Greenspahn demonstrates great industry here in collecting a large quantity of sources (biblical and extrabiblical, of Israelite and foreign origin) representing the phenomenon of the preeminence of younger siblings in their families. The sources that he discusses refer to various periods, no doubt reflecting a clear tendency that was dominant in the framework of social structure of the biblical period. 1. For various issues pertaining to the firstborn in Israel, see my recent books, Studies in Biblical Law: From the Hebrew Bible to the Dead Sea Scrolls, JSOT Monograph Series 176 (Sheffield, 1994), pp. 166-281, and Issues in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Hebrew) (Tel Aviv, 1994), pp. 13-75.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 375 In the opening chapter, and more especially in the concluding one, Greenspahn sees theological as well as ideological-sociological factors in the hegemony of younger siblings. He interprets this phenomenon as an expression of God's tendency to arrange history and society. This means, according to Greenspahn, that one can explain these events neither as mere coincidence nor as the result of the abilities of the personalities involved in them, nor as an outcome of the history of these families. According to his interpretation, everything is perceived as a result of God's plan. I think that in many cases the attempt to provide such an interpretation is rather artificial. To be clear: I do not disagree with the data brought by the author, but with his, interpretation of the sources in several places. One cannot deny that Israelite society-in its broad form, and on the level of its leadership and the heads of families-did not consist of firstborns alone. Therefore, as the people at large comprised a minority of firstborns and a majority of ordinary children, there is no doubt that many others had an opportunity to enhance their social position. Within this framework there was no impediment against younger siblings reaching an important position. However, one cannot see a uniform principle acting in all those cases in which younger siblings became the leaders of their families or of the country. Even if God's hand is involved in everything that happens, there is no justification for finding a system of choosing these persons to become leaders on the basis of their family status. Nor can I see any good reason to combine the issues of primogeniture and ultimogeniture, which belong to the family framework, with the general and national contexts, as the author does in the last chapter. Despite these reservations, Greenspahn's book is a very basic and important monograph regarding the issues of the structure of family and society in Israel during the biblical period. It is rich with many sources of various origins, and will doubtless serve as an important source for future research. Gershon Brin Tel Aviv University Ramat Aviv, Israel</page></plain_text>
