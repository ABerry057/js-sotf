<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Jeffrey L. Rubenstein. Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999. xvi, 435 pp. Shulamit Valler. Women and Womanhood in the Talmud. Translated by Betty Sigler Rozen. Brown Judaic Series, 321. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1999. xx, 139 pp. Of the various genres of classical aggadic literature, the Talmudic "sage sto- ries" are perhaps the most open to literary interpretation using contemporary meth- ods. Other aggadic forms lack parallels in the conventional Western literary canon. Sage stories, in contrast, are short narratives that have much in common with those found in other, more well-studied, literary traditions. The tools of narrative analy- sis that have been developed by scholars of other literatures can thus be fruitfully applied to these rabbinic sage stories. It is therefore somewhat surprising that de- spite the proliferation of literary studies on midrash and aggada appearing in En- glish in recent years, the analysis of sage stories has remained a relatively neglected field of inquiry among Anglophone scholars. This field has been dominated by Is- raeli scholars such as Jonah Fraenkel and Ofra Meir, whose work has appeared largely in Hebrew. Jeffrey Rubenstein's Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Compo- sition and Culture and the recent translation of Shulamit Valler's Nashim ve- Nashiut be-sipure ha- Talmud (Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1993) under the title Women and Womanhood in the Talmud are thus welcome and important additions to the world of English-language rabbinics scholarship. Rubenstein's book consists of analyses of six extended narratives from the Babylonian Talmud: "The Oven of Akhnai" (Bava Metsia 59a-59b), "Elisha ben Avuya" (Hagigga 15a-15b), "R. Shimon bar Yochai in the Cave" (Shabbat 33b- 34a), "Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai's Encounter with Vespasian" (Gittin 55b- 56b), "The Expulsion of R. Meir and R. Natan from the Academy" (Horayot 13b- 14a), and "The Final Judgment of the Nations" (Avoda Zara 2a-3b). These stories are some of the richest and most famous in Talmud. This fact, in addition to the book's lucid style, gives the book special value to specialists and non-specialists alike. Rubenstein's method of literary analysis owes much to the structuralist ap- proach pioneered by Jonah Fraenkel. Rubenstein elucidates the various structures and symmetries of his Talmudic stories and demonstrates the Talmudic authors' use of such literary devices as wordplay, key words, irony, and paradox. Like Fraenkel, Rubenstein is also attentive to the human elements of the stories. This sensitivity allows Rubenstein to give fresh insight into stories that have already been extensively discussed. Thus, in his interpretation of "The Oven of Achnai," Rubenstein calls the reader's attention away from the theological issues that have dominated previous discussions of the story and toward the themes of human vio- lence and suffering. The centrality of these themes to the story explains its posi- tion at the end of a Talmudic discussion of "verbal oppression." Rubenstein moves beyond Fraenkel's structuralism by integrating into his reading strategy the methods of Talmudic source and redaction criticism, as de- veloped by David Halivni and Shamma Friedman. Rubenstein argues that editor- ial processes that shaped the legal sugyot of the Bavli were also crucial to the for- 129</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review mation of the Bavli's narrative sections: The imprint of the Stammaim, the anony- mous post-Amoraic editors of the Talmud, is discernible throughout narratives of the Babylonian Talmud. It was the Stammaim who reworked the earlier Palestin- ian aggadic sources at their disposal through a process of "embellishment, expan- sion, and supplementation." The Stammaim thereby adapted the earlier sources to their new contexts in the Bavli and to the Stammaim's own sensibilities. Ruben- stein shows how the editors of the Talmud altered stories not only to fit into the immediate conversation into which they are placed, but also to reflect themes and motifs present elsewhere in that particular chapter of the Mishna and Talmud. He also demonstrates how Babylonian stories function as exegeses of earlier histori- cal traditions. For example, many of the details of the Bavli's extended account of the life of Elisha b. Avuya are shown to be explications of phrases from the Tosef- ta's terse account of Elisha b. Avuya's case. On the basis of his comparisons be- tween parallel Babylonian and Palestinian narrative sources, Rubenstein also points to several potentially valuable distinctions between the narrative arts of the Bavli and the Yerushalmi. Among them are the Bavli's propensity for candidly por- traying the faults and failures of rabbis of previous generations and the Yerushal- mi's tendency to deviate from strict chronological order in narrating the events of a story. Since in Rubernstein's view, the stories found in the Bavli are essentially the product of the Stammaim, it follows that these stories can be used as windows into the intellectual and spiritual world of the Stammaim. In particular, Rubenstein sees the world of the academy portrayed in these stories, with its intricate social struc- ture and its emphasis on dialectic Torah study, as reflecting the conditions in the yeshivot of post-Amoraic Babylonia rather than earlier conditions in Palestine and Babylonia, as other scholars have argued. Rubenstein extends the essentially liter- ary nature of his work by using the results of his studies to contribute to our un- derstanding of the social and cultural history of Judaism at a critical juncture of history. Shulamit Valler's book, as the title suggests, belongs essentially to the bur- geoning discourse on gender in rabbinic literature. Valler's underlying assumption is that narrative material is a more useful source for discovering the rabbis' atti- tudes towards woman than Halachic or other discursive sources. She focuses her attention on rabbinic stories that deal with the status of women. Unlike Rubenstein, who concentrates on longer, more complex stories, Valler turns her attention to col- lections of brief, relatively simple stories whose primary purpose is to record le- gal precedents. Her study thus offers an important complement to Rubenstein's. While the stories that Rubenstein discusses are more interesting than those in Valler's book, Valler's selection is more representative of the genre of rabbinic sage stories. Brief accounts of legal cases and rulings represent the overwhelming ma- jority of sage stories in the Talmud, whereas extended narratives are quite rare. Valler's methodology is similar to Rubenstein's. She too seeks to combine literary criticism with the conclusions of twentieth-century American Talmud crit- icism. Her basic argument is that, through the careful editing and arrangement, the Stammaitic editors took earlier Palestinian materials and fashioned them into the- matic story collections that are literary works in themselves. By organizing stories 130</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews in a way that creates a development of the common themes of the stories, the edi- tors give these collective works meaning that transcends the messages of the indi- vidual narratives. Valler also demonstrates how these aggadic compilations are often in ten- sion with their Halachic contexts. For example, in Chapter Three, she shows how a series of stories brought in the sugya in Ketubot 8b- 10b serves to undermine the Talmud's previous statements that a husband is to be believed if he claims that he found that his wife was not a virgin on their wedding night. The story collection shows that this ruling is correct only in theory. In practice, the rabbis never an- nulled a marriage on the basis of such a claim. Valler's ultimate argument is that the implicit message of the Stammaitic ed- itors is often more sensitive to the woman's perspective than the explicit statements of the earlier Tannaitic and Amoraic sources of the Talmud. This is a bold claim that certainly warrants further study. If correct, it represents an important contri- bution to the study of rabbinic Judaism. However, we should be cautious of claims that rabbinic Judaism evolved along a trajectory that brought it more in line with modern values. Valler also suggests that aggada is somehow a more female-friendly mode of discourse than halacha. This is a difficult claim to back up. There is no shortage of halachic texts which show great sensitivity towards women and many aggadic texts fail to do so. Finally, a note on the translation. While Betty Sigler Rozen shows herself to be an able translator of Valler's modern Hebrew text, the same cannot be said with regard to her work on the rabbinic texts cited by Valler. In her renderings of pas- sages from the Bavli, Rozen makes unattributed use of the Soncino translation. This is a potential source of confusion for the reader because the Soncino transla- tion of the standard printed edition does not always correspond to the manuscript traditions presented by Valler. Rozen's translations of the Yerushalmi, which ap- pear to be original, contain numerous mistakes and inconsistencies. It is a pity that the translation does not live up to the high standards of the original work. Moshe Simon Boston, Massachusetts</page></plain_text>
