Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 1999. xiii, 360 pp. Abraham David. In Zion and Jerusalem: The Itinerary of Rabbi Moses Basola (1521-1523). Jerusalem: C. G. Foundation Jerusalem Project Publications, 1999. 148 pp. (English), 48 pp. (Hebrew). The intensification of Jewish settlement in Eretz Israel in the wake of ex- pulsions and messianic stirrings brought together outstanding figures whose indi- vidual and collective achievements left an enduring imprint on Jewish life. The re- naissance in sixteenth-century Eretz Israel, particularly in Safed, produced one of the most remarkable and creative moments in Jewish intellectual, religious, and cultural history. Refugees from Spain and Portugal, as well as from Italian and Ger- man lands, wended their exile-weary way to the Holy Land. Fueled by a new, more favorable Ottoman administration and unprecedented economic opportunities, the conditions were set for the renewal of Jewish cultural life. Abraham David's book To Come to the Land is not primarily about the processes of immigration to the land, although a brief chapter is devoted to that subject at the beginning. It focusses on specific aspects of Jewish life in sixteenth-century Eretz Israel, primarily in Jerusalem and Safed. Among the titanic figures of the sixteenth-century Jewish intellectual world Joseph Karo, author of the compendium of Jewish law Bet Yosef and the code Shulkhzan Arukh, left an enduring imprint on the course of halakhah. Moses Cor- dovero, Isaac Luria, and Hayim Vital transformed the direction of kabbalah. Eleazar Azikri wrote Sefer HIaredim, an eminent ethical-kabbalistic work, while he and Solomon Alkabetz contributed religious poetry that is recited in synagogues around the world to this day. The practices of the kabbalist h.avurah (fellowship) enriched Jewish ritual and devotional life. The attempt by Safed scholar Jacob Be- rab to revive the ancient practice of semikhah, apostolic ordination, with messian- ic undertones, aroused a controversy with Levi ibn Habib of Jerusalem. It pitted scholar against scholar, Jerusalem against Safed, Iberian exile against temporary marrano, and electrified rabbis around the world. Abraham David has eschewed virtually all discussion of the substance of these intellectual and spiritual turning points. Instead, he has chosen to explore the political, economic, and communal circumstances that enabled this moment to come about. David is a leading scholar of "late" geniza material, particularly the docu- 137</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review ments dating from the fifteenth through seventeenth century. Over the past two decades, he has published dozens of these documents in studies which, in their ag- gregate, illuminate the world-of the Jewish Mediterranean and Middle East at a time of great turbulence and upheaval. David's intimate knowledge of the litera- ture of the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Mediterranean world-its chronicles, correspondence, and travel literature-forms the essential building blocks of his work. To Come to the Land represents a double achievement. It is a useful and co- herent synthesis of the results of David's specialized publications, and it is ren- dered into accessible English. The primary contribution of this book revolves around two poles: the eco- nomic activities, on the one hand, and the internal communal organization, on the other, of Jerusalem and Safed Jewry. In both realms, David sheds new light on fas- cinating and significant dimensions of this Jewish world. While support of insti- tutions in the Holy Land helped maintain close ties with diaspora communities, charity was far from the only source of income in sixteenth-century Ottoman Palestine. The Ottomans placed few economic restrictions on Jews, and their eco- nomic activities spanned agriculture, manufacture, trade, and finance. Neverthe- less, Jews were taxed at exorbitant rates, were subject to capricious local rulers, and sometimes suffered severe hardship. "As far as food is concerned, everyone is in trouble, because meat is not available daily in Jerusalem as it is in our land [Italy], nor are fish and fruits ... apples and pears are imported from Damascus and are very expensive" (p. 43). This passage from an immigrant's letter describ- ing the economic privation in early-sixteenth-century Ottoman Jerusalem can serve as an exemplar of the riches and strengths of To Come to the Land. David draws directly from primary sources so that every set of statistics, every larger pat- tern, is sustained by numerous citations, which add color and detail and bring the material to life. Another excerpt from a primary source, however, hints at a tantalizing sub- ject that David does not address. "Every man and every woman who works woolen fabric earns an abundant living" (p. 37). This description of economic opportuni- ty in a letter from David min ha-Adummim raises important questions. Did Jew- ish women play any role in the textile industry that supported much of the eco- nomic boom in sixteenth-century Safed? Traditionally, this industry tended to be dominated by women in some sectors, such as design and weaving. Did the immi- grants generally arrive in family units or as single men? In his appendix providing shipboard advice to travelers, Moses Basola made recommendations for travelling Jewish families. Basola's text commented on the large number of widows residing in Jerusalem (p. 82), but even this does not elicit from David any analysis what- soever. In seventeenth-century Jerusalem there was such a dearth of marriageable women that a takkanah forbade Jewish men to live there unless they were married. Was this a problem in the sixteenth century too? A book devoted to economic and communal history should have addressed these questions but the lives and even existence of women find no place in this book.1 1. This omission is all the more regrettable as David is cited as a resource person in other stud- ies that focus on Sephardic women in this period. See Joel L. Kramer, "Spanish Ladies from the Cairo 138</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The chapters on communal organization and education shed new light on these institutions of Jewish life. Where were the Jewish quarters situated? How did the many different diaspora groups govern themselves and relate with others? David's book excels at answering these questions. His picture of the universal scholarship of an entire population provides the context and framework for the cel- ebrated cultural flowering in sixteenth-century Safed, whose content, however, is touched on only briefly. Ultimately, it is regrettable that David set such strict pa- rameters for himself. Had he provided more material on the substance of the achievement of sixteenth-century Eretz Israel, this book could have provided the best one-volume introduction to the entire subject in English. A section of brief bi- ographies appended at the end of the book is a handy reference, a "Who's Who" of sixteenth-century rabbinic figures in the Holy Land, but the space devoted to this catalogue could have been better used for a synthesis of the spiritual and in- tellectual component of Safed's rise. In Zion and Jerusalem: The Itinerary of Moses Basola is the latest in a se- ries of early modern chronicles or travel journals that David has edited and trans- lated. His introduction and notes to Basola's itinerary form a natural complement to the more synthetic treatment in To Come to the Land. The itinerary provides an individual portrait of one traveller's impressions and motivations. David touches several times on the possible messianic motivations guiding Basola (p. 42). His discussion of the Jew from Cush whose description is similar to that of David Reubeni but who was apparently a different person, illuminates one aspect of a phenomenon that was recently called "The Jerusalem Syndrome" in its sixteenth- century variation. Basola's discussion of the "reliable" information he was able to gather concerning the Sambatyon and the Ten Tribes further illustrates the atmo- sphere of expectation that pervaded the Holy Land during Basola's time. Basola's rich text conveys both the texture and outlines of his personal experience as a pil- grim and the complexion of the communal life in sixteenth-century Eretz Israel as he saw it. It contains important information about the ritual and liturgy connected with the visiting of holy sites and venerated graves. Basola listed the takkanot cur- rent in Jerusalem during his stay, a primary source of great interest. Ultimate- ly, however, one wishes for a better sense of the person, and the larger contours of his life. Dena Ordan has provided felicitous translations of both volumes, free of the strained and stilted prose that often characterizes such endeavors. One quibble, however: Some sources cited by David that are available in English are not listed in in the documentation in their English translation. For example, in citing Jacob Katz' pioneering analysis of the semikhah controversy, only the Hebrew citation is listed. The interested reader would not know that an English translation has been available for years.2 In a book for serious readers, translated for those who do not Geniza," in Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean World After 1492, Alisa Meyuhas Ginio, ed., (London: Frank Cass, 1992), p. 243, n. 23.
