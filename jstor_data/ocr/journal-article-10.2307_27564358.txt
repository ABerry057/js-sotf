One is the traditional philological-historical approach, which traces its roots back to the European Wissenschaft des Judentums tradition of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In its current form, tra ditional Talmud criticism is perhaps most associated in Israel with the work of J. N. Epstein, the founder of the Hebrew University Talmud Department and the "father of exact scientific Talmudic inquiry."1 While most of Epstein's students proceeded to shape the study of rabbinic literature in the Israeli academy, Saul Lie berman, perhaps his most distinguished disciple, moved to America, where his presence dominated the study of rabbinic literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary in the postwar decades.2 Traditional Talmud criticism is characterized by a scrupulous attention to manuscripts and textual variants, a systematic use of the findings of Semitic and comparative linguistics, and the use of form and source criticism to determine the history and development of larger textual units. The second, more contemporary approach encompasses a spectrum of dis ciplines whose methodologies have become increasingly interrelated in recent decades. They include comparative literature, historiography, anthropology, and critical legal studies. These disciplines, as they are currently practiced in the academy, all draw on a range of tools and approaches to the study of texts, cul tures, and ideas that are rooted in the intellectual movements we might broadly refer to as structuralism and poststructuralism. They direct scholars to read texts as cultural artifacts and to understand cultures as textual and conceptual con structs. The current climate encourages scholars to look beyond their disciplines 1.

The members of the group represented in this symposium share deep commitments both to the methods of traditional Talmud criticism and to contem porary humanistic and social scientific approaches. Most went to college and graduate school in the late eighties or early nineties and, as such, take for granted the possibility that rabbinic texts and culture can and should be studied using contemporary humanistic and social scientific methods. Yet a majority of us were also trained in traditional talmudic criticism, either in Israeli universities or at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and firmly believe that philological rigor and careful textual analysis are prerequisites for any serious reading of rabbinic texts. Ishay Rosen-Zvi's work is a good example of this confluence of approaches. In the introduction to his recently published book, The Rite That Was Not: Temple, Midrash and Gender Ln Tractate Sotah} he declares that "this study reflects an effort to bridge two very different approaches: textual-philological Talmud criticism and methods from the field of cultural studies, especially Foucauldian analytic tools." The bulk of The Rite That Was Not consists of a series of readings of individual passages in Mishnah Sotah. Rosen-Zvi explicates the rabbinic text through a careful consideration of manuscript evidence, the systematic compari son of parallel texts, and constant attention to the historical development of halakhic discourse. However, unlike the work of many of his Israeli colleagues, interwoven into Rosen-Zvi's textual analyses are ideas and citations from Michel Foucault and other cultural historians of antiquity. The relationship between the two approaches here is not simply a hierar chal one, in which traditional Talmud criticism establishes a textual and historical platform on which a more theoretical interpretive structure can be erected. Rather, cultural theory contributes directly to Rosen-Zvi's textual analysis. Traditional scholars often put forward sets of binary possibilities to account for difficulties in the talmudic text. Rosen-Zvi utilizes cultural theorists' sensi tivity to the ambiguities and complexities of cultural phenomena to bridge the gap between these opposing possibilities to create a more nuanced reading of the text. In order to convey a sense of Rosen-Zvi's methods, I will summarize the main arguments of Chapter 1 of his book, which analyzes the first stage of the sotah process, kinui. The Bible appears to give the husband the right to initiate a sotah proceeding any time a "fit of jealously (ruah kinah) comes over him" (Numbers 5:14). The Mishnah, however, takes this verse to refer to a legal pro cedure in which the husband publicly warns the wife to break off social interaction with another man. If the woman ignores these instructions, only then can sotah proceedings begin. Previous scholars have seen the formalization of kinui as a rabbinic innovation that protects women from capricious accusations by their 3.

First, he shows that already in sources of the Second Temple era such as Philo and the Dead Sea Scrolls, there is a movement to establish objective criteria for initiating the sotah process. Hence, this cannot be seen as a rabbinic inno vation. Furthermore, the Mishnah itself takes the institution of kinui for granted. The focus of its discussion is not on the protection of the woman. What, then, is the significance of kinui in the Mishnah? In order to answer this question, Rosen-Zvi turns his attention to a problematic element of the text that has concerned scholars since talmudic times. Mishnah Sotah 1:2 states that kinui is defined as a husband publicly forbidding his wife from speaking with a certain man. The Mishnah then goes on to state that if the wife speaks with the man in ques tion, she does not become liable for the sotah ritual. Rather, only if she secludes herself with the man for a period sufficient for relations to have occurred can she be forced to undergo the ritual. The Mishnah apparently contradicts itself. What is kinuil Is it a prohibition of speech or a prohibition of seclusion with another man? Rosen-Zvi cites the interpretation of J. N. Epstein, who argues that this Mishnah is composed of two different strata. The first part of the Mishnah belongs to an earlier stage in the development of the halakhah, in which kinui was understood as a total ban against talking to the man in question. The second part of the Mishnah belongs to a later stage in which kinui was understood to be only a prohibition against secluding herself with the man.5 Rosen-Zvi provisionally accepts Epstein's basic argument, with an important difference. Epstein sees in this Mishnah the positive historical development of a halakhic concept. For Rosen-Zvi, this Mishnah displays an internal tension that reflects an ongoing discourse about gender and power relations. He goes on to argue that at the heart of the rabbinic discussions of kinui in the Mishnah and through out the classical rabbinic corpus, is a debate about the extent of a husband's right to control his wife's behavior and lifestyle. Though the rabbis are ostensibly talking about an extreme and, in the absence of a Temple, theor etical case, in fact they are dealing with a fundamental day-to-day issue. Rosen-Zvi further illuminates this tension between the conflicting agendas of the sources by drawing on the work of David Cohen, a cultural historian of the classical world. According to Cohen, concern with women's public behavior in ancient Greece was rooted in the assumption that one could infer the nature of a woman's behaviors behind closed doors based on how she acted in public spaces. The result was a "politics of reputation" that functioned as a powerful force for social control.6 Rosen-Zvi sees a similar interrelationship between rab binic regulation of the public and private behaviors of women in both extreme cases, such as those involving the sotah ritual, and in more normative situations. In the hands of the rabbis, Rosen-Zvi argues, "[kinui] is transformed into a site, an 4.

Whereas previous scholars have seen progressive development of ideas and texts, Rosen-Zvi sees a complex interplay between individual desire and social norms. On a broader level, Rosen-Zvi uses this combination of textual and cultural criticism to argue that the Mishnah presents a radically reworked version of the biblical sotah ritual that is based on ideological and hermeneutic concerns rather than on actual traditions about ritual practice in the Second Temple. He thus challenges the century-old critical assumption that Mishnah Sotah is "early Mishnah" that is based on eyewitness accounts of the Temple cult.7 Rosen-Zvi argues that there is no evidence either in other rabbinic or in Second Temple era sources that a sotah ritual of the sort described in the Mishnah was ever actu ally practiced. Furthermore, as we have seen, his readings of individual passages of the Mishnah and other rabbinic discussions of the sotah text demonstrate that these texts are in fact ideologically motivated and concerned with perennial issues of gender and authority, and not merely with a particular aspect of the Temple cult. Rosen-Zvi sees Mishnah Sotah as a later work?composed perhaps in the second century?that is a product not of rabbinic memory but of rabbinic imagination. The text reflects the authors' attempts to interpret the bibli cal sotah passage in light of their own concerns rather than an effort at transmitting accurate historical information about practices in the Temple. In making this case about the dating and reliability of the Mishnah's account of the sotah ritual, Rosen-Zvi follows in the footsteps of Jacob Neusner, who con sistently argues for minimalist dating of rabbinic texts in general and for the Mishnah in particular.8 He also sees mishnaic accounts, especially of the pre-70 era, as rooted in rhetorical and ideological concerns rather than in an attempt to faithfully record historical events and circumstances.9 Rosen-Zvi's readings cannot, however, ultimately be characterized as Neusnerian. Neusner sees mishnaic tractates as presenting clear-cut and ultimately self-evident ideological "statements." Rosen-Zvi, in contrast, sees the Mishnah as a multivalent text whose meanings can only be fully investigated by placing the text in its social and cultural contexts. Furthermore, Rosen-Zvi sees his work as a continua tion of a conversation started by the great historical philologists of the twentieth century, not a radical break from it. His argument for a late dating of the Mishnah's description of the sotah ritual is a good example of how contemporary methods of 7. David Zvi Hoffmann, Hamishnah harishonah (Berlin: S.

This cross-fertilization between classical philological methods and contem porary humanistic approaches need not only benefit the study of rabbinic texts. There is also great potential for students of rabbinic literature and culture to make significant conceptual and methodological contributions to fields such as literary, legal, and cultural studies. Rabbinic texts and culture cannot ultimately be assimilated into paradigms developed to explain other literatures and civiliza tions. Scholars of rabbinic Judaism must act as methodological tinkerers, tweaking the work of others so that it functions in a rabbinic context. The application of outside models to the field of rabbinics thus opens the possibility of revealing both the shortcomings and the unseen potentialities of those models. In the case of Foucault, scholars of rabbinics have a particular opportunity to contribute to a wider conversation. On the one hand, Foucault's concern with the way in which authority asserts itself through the control of the body and private life curiously resonates with the way in which the Mishnah, and halakhah in general, venture into every nook and cranny of human experience.10 On the other hand, as Daniel Boyar?n and Elizabeth Castelli have written, Foucault's History [of Sexuality] ... makes virtually no mention of the "Jews" or of the products/texts of Jewish cultural history ... [This] may in fact con stitute an empirical problem for the genealogy itself In so far as Foucault claims certain moments of causality or even non-factitious co-occurrences in History, then possible counter examples from Jewish cultural history ... might put into question some of the central claims of Foucault's genealogies.11 In a recent article on The Testament of Reuben,12 Rosen-Zvi set out to demonstrate Boyar?n and Castelli's claims. He locates the origins of "the shift of sex from an inter- to an intra-personal issue"13 in a Second Temple-era Jewish text. This chal lenges Foucault, who saw this development as one of the major innovations of early Christianity, centuries later. In his book, however, Rosen-Zvi does not use his findings from rabbinic texts to directly confront "Foucault's Jewish lacuna."14 He simply lays the groundwork for such a critique of Foucault's project by presenting Foucault-inspired readings of rabbinic texts. 10.

One question that I would especially like to see investigated is how Foucault's notion of "pastoral power" might apply to the construction and nature of rabbinic authority in the talmudic period. Foucault sees this concept of the "individualizing" of power in a way that transcends both the state and geographic territory as having its roots in the ancient Near East and in the Hebrew Bible in particular.15 As such, inves tigating the question of whether and how the rabbis inherited such an approach to political authority from the Bible would be of great interest. Such a project could not only improve our understanding of rabbinic authority, it could also provide us with an alternative against which to evaluate and critique Foucault's conceptions of spiritual and temporal authority in early Christianity. In addition to these two approaches, the traditional philological and the con temporary humanist-social scientific, there is a third approach that is a sort of silent partner in the enterprise under consideration. This is the so-called conceptual analytical school of Talmud study, which emerged in the yeshivot of northeastern Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and continues to be practiced and developed in many traditional yeshivot, both in the United States and Israel. This conceptual-analytical or "Lithuanian" approach is stubbornly ahistorical and can be quite oblivious to textual concerns as Western academics understand them. The Lithuanian method is committed to the notion that under lying classical and medieval rabbinic texts is a coherent logic that can be expressed through careful formulation and manipulation of conceptual categories.16 I do not think that it is a coincidence that Rosen-Zvi, Avraham Walfish, and this author, as well as many others currently working in the field, were trained in this method of reading rabbinic texts before we had any systematic exposure to historical philological analysis.17 For those of us brought up in this Lithuanian school, its methods and assumptions inevitably condition our reading practices, if not directly, then reflexively. The influx of yeshiva-trained students into the world of academic Talmud study is hardly a recent development. What is new in this generation is the encoun ter between the conceptual-analytic approach and contemporary structuralist and poststructuralist methodologies. The Lithuanian approach holds forth the proposition that rabbinic texts are not merely linguistic and historical artifacts but conveyors of meaning that can best be explicated by subjecting the texts to 15.

Modern and postmodern approaches similarly seek meaning and conceptual coherence in texts and cultures through the construction and deconstruction of conceptual and literary categories, though they do so on very different methodological and metaphysical terms. When these two contrast ing approaches are brought together, the result is a synergy that leads to particu larly rich readings and interpretations. To give a concrete example of this interface between the conceptual-analytic approach and conventional academic methods, let us turn to Chapter 3 of Rosen Zvi's book. In this chapter, Rosen-Zvi examines the stage of the sotah ritual in which the priest forcibly pulls open the suspected adulteress's clothes to "reveal her heart." He systematically compares this act to three other cases in which halakhic norms mandate the forcible removing or tearing of clothing: the admin istration of corporal punishment, the mourning ritual, and the procedure for capital punishment. Rosen-Zvi's analysis consists of a series of what would be called hilukim or hakirot in traditional Lithuanian terms: careful conceptual distinctions meant to clarify the relationship between different cases, principles, or areas of law.18 He opens by distinguishing between the act and the consequence (ma'aseh versus halot in traditional terminology)19 of pulling off the sotah's garment. Based on a careful reading of the text of the Mishnah, he concludes that the central focus is the result of the removal: the "revealing of the heart" of the woman, that is, exposing her nudity with the intent of shaming the woman. In the case of the flogging, the victim also has his clothes stripped off. Rosen Zvi notes the close linguistic parallels between the Mishnah's descriptions of these two procedures. He further argues that, as in the case of sotah, in the case of corporal punishment, shaming is an important factor in the rabbinic understand ing of the ritual stripping of garments. However, Rosen-Zvi also points out an important difference between the two procedures. In order to do so, he brings into play a classic distinction in tra ditional halakhic discourse, that between events that take place in public and those that take place in private (befarhesia versus beyahid). Rosen-Zvi argues that the shame produced in the flogging ritual cannot be compared to that of the sotah ritual because in the case of the former, there is no reference to the presence of any audience. Punishment presumably takes place within the closed precincts of the courthouse. In contrast, the sotah ritual is a public spectacle that occurs in the Temple courtyard. It is a public shaming. Rosen-Zvi then proceeds to the ritual tearing of clothes by the mourner. In order to explain the nature of this practice, he further develops the distinction between act and consequence. He argues that there are two aspects (shenei dinim in conceptual-analytic parlance20) of this mourning rite. Both the act and the consequence are significant. The sources see the act of tearing one's clothes 18. On these terms, see Solomon, The Analytic Movement, 117-20. 19. On distinctions of this nature in the work of the conceptual-analytic school, see Solomon, The Analytic Movement, 128-32; and Yitzchak Adler, Lomdus: A Substructural Analysis of Conceptual Talmudic Thought (New York: Bet Sha'ar Press, 1989), 37-39. 20. See Adler, Lomdus, 10-18. 257</page><page sequence="8">Moshe Simon-Shoshan as being an expression of mourning. The significant consequence of this act is not, however, the revealed nakedness and concomitant shaming, as in the case o? sotah. In fact, the sources take pains to ensure that a woman's nakedness is not exposed in the course of the tearing. Rather, it is the production of a halakhically significant object (hefzah), the torn clothing, that continues to serve as a symbol of mourning for the duration of the mourning period, if not longer.21 Rabbi Joseph B. Solo veitchick, the preeminent practitioner of the conceptual-analytic approach in the second half of the twentieth century, used a similar set of distinctions in his own discussion of this rite.22 As such, Rosen-Zvi's analysis of the mourning ritual is particularly important in demonstrating the affinity between his method and that of the conceptual-analytic school. Finally, Rosen-Zvi turns to the rabbinic protocols for capital punishment. According to R. Judah, both men and women must be stripped before execution. Men are then covered from the front and women from both sides before execution. According to the rabbis, males are actually executed naked, whereas females are not. Rosen-Zvi sees this as the closest parallel to the case of sotah because in his reading, the stripping of the execution victim is also meant to incur public shaming. Once again, however, in the sources regarding execution, unlike in sotah, special concern is shown to limit or prevent the exposure of female nudity. Through this careful comparative analysis, Rosen-Zvi is able to discern the distinctive nature of the "revealing of the heart" of the sotah. It is an act remov ing or tearing clothing whose purpose is to reveal female nakedness in order to publicly shame the sotah. In his discussion of ritual tearing and removal of clothing, Rosen-Zvi draws on the tools and concerns of the conceptual-analytic method. Many of his arguments could easily be reformulated using traditional terminology. Yet Rosen-Zvi's ultimate goal here is not the revelation of some abstract, essential nature of this aspect of the sotah ritual. Rather, Rosen-Zvi uses these conceptual tools in order to investigate the role of socially constructed categories, such as shame and nudity, in the functioning of these rituals and ritual texts and within the cultures and authority structures that created and practiced them.23 Lithuanian methods, properly adapted, thus turn out to be most useful in pursuing French social-scientific agendas in rabbinic texts. 21. Clothes torn in mourning for a parent may never be resown and hence serve as a reminder of loss as long as they remain in the mourner's possession. 22. Joseph B.

Rosen-Zvi's discussion of these details o? sotah ritual would be further enriched by a treat ment of Foucault's discussion of the concept of exomologeisis in Christianity. In the course of this dis cussion, Foucault cites a passage from Jerome in which he describes the penance practiced by an adulteress that involves, among other things, the dishevelment of her hair and the revealing of her "naked breast." This aspect of the sotah ritual might be a particularly good locale to compare and con trast the construction of the self in rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity.

Carrette (New York: Routledge, 1999), 158-81. 258</page><page sequence="9">Between Philology and Foucault What I have said thus far applies not only to recent studies on the Mishnah but also to the work of a broader group of scholars who attempt to combine these intellectual traditions in the study of all aspects of rabbinic literature, be it mishnaic, midrashic, or talmudic. The foregoing discussion also describes, for example, Barry Wimpfheimer's work on the Bavli and, to some degree, Joshua Levinson's work on midrash aggadah24 Yet the Mishnah seems to hold a particular attraction for young scholars who seek to apply the methodological synthesis described earlier to rabbinic texts. The question that remains to be dealt with is, why does the Mishnah in particular interest these scholars? On a certain level, there is a pragmatic element at work here. In my own case, in writing my dissertation,25 I initially set out to study not the Mishnah but rabbinic narrative in general and specifically its relationship to halakhic dis course. I chose to focus on the Mishnah because I saw it as a convenient entry point into the larger rabbinic corpus. It is a relatively short, straightforward, and familiar text. It was quite feasible to study the entire corpus and subject a signifi cant part of it to close analysis within the course of a few years. My work was further aided by the high level of the current state of virtually every aspect of Mishnah scholarship, unparalleled in other realms of rabbinic scholarship. There are several high-quality manuscripts of the Mishnah and no shortage of excellent commentaries, starting with that of Maimonides, through the twentieth-century works of Chanoch Albeck, Pinchas Kehati, and Abraham Goldberg.26 The Mishnah has been the subject of extensive studies by many of the great modern Talmud critics, notably Albeck and J. N. Epstein.27 There is also a plethora of works by linguists on the grammar and syntax of mishnaic Hebrew.28 In short, the Mishnah offers the opportunity to engage in literary and 24.

But the Mishnah is attractive not only because of its accessibility. There is also something deeply appealing about the Mishnah to scholars with the sort of conceptual and ideological orientation exhibited by Rosen-Zvi and others in this group. There is something "clean" about the Mishnah's discourse when compared to other halakhic texts. It is not dominated by hermeneutic dialectics the way the Midrashei halakhah or the Talmuds are. Furthermore, as Judith Hauptman and Shamma Friedman have argued, compared to its closest relative, the Tosefta, the Mishnah is a far more polished and tightly edited text.29 However, these very qualities of the Mishnah give the impression that its laws hang from a thread. They are not primarily rooted either in the precision of scholastic hermeneutics or in faithful, undifferentiated transmission. What, then, is source of the Mishnah's authority? Jacob Neusner was perhaps the first modern scholar to suggest that the authority of the Mishnah's rhetoric lies in its own internal coherence.30 According to him, underlying the Mishnah's legal prin ciples and rulings is a conceptual and ideological substratum. The Mishnah's halakhic constructs grow directly out of this conceptual-ideological system that lies just beneath its surface. Of course, students of the Mishnah since the period of the Amoraim have always sought to understand how its various cases and rulings fit into a larger system of legal principles. Recent scholars, such as Leib Moscovitz and Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, have continued this effort in their attempts to understand how the form and rhetoric of the Mishnah in fact convey such legal conceptualization.31 Neusner's innovation was his claim that this con ceptual structure underlying the Mishnah relates not to the narrowly defined tech nical legal issues that are the ostensible focus of the Mishnah but rather to "philosophical" concerns. In a far more rigorous manner, Avraham Walfish argues that underlying the Mishnah's discussion of technical laws is a poetic fra mework that makes use of sophisticated literary devices to highlight fundamental existential issues implicit in the laws.32 Rosen-Zvi reflects yet a third approach, one that sees the underlying discourse of the Mishnah as being neither legal nor philosophical but essentially political. At the core of Rosen-Zvi's argument lies the claim that the rabbis of the Mishnah transformed the biblical sotah ritual from a cultic ordeal that 29.

We have already seen how Rosen-Zvi interprets both the kinui and the "revealing of the heart" stages of sotah ritual as reflecting rabbinic notions about the control of women. Taken as a whole, Rosen-Zvi argues, underlying the technical cultic descriptions of Mishnah Sotah is "a fantasy of total control, without limits, of the female body." Like Beth Berkowitz, Chaya Halberstam,33 and the present author, Rosen-Zvi sees at the heart of the Mishnah's conceptual ideological substratum "a discourse of authority." In particular, the Mishnah focuses on the authority of the rabbis as authoritative legislators, interpreters, and exemplars of the law. For scholars of this school, in its treatment of individual laws and situations, the Mishnah in fact engages in larger discussions of the nature of these laws, the authority on which they rest, and the community and individuals they seek to regulate. In the final chapter of his book, Rosen-Zvi acknowledges the similarity between his approach to these matters and that of Jacob Neusner. He calls attention to the fact that Neusner was the first to argue that the Mishnah constructs not simply a conceptual framework but an alternate reality.34 The notion that the Mishnah creates imaginative narrative worlds is central not only to Rosen-Zvi's work but also to my own and to that of Beth Berkowitz.35 All three of us see this "world making" power of the mishnaic text as central to its rhetorical force and efficacy. However, as Rosen-Zvi stresses, there are important differences between his (as well as Berkowitz's and my own) understanding of this aspect of the Mishnah and Neusner's conception. First of all, in Neusner's view, the world that the Mishnah creates is totally closed off from the rabbis' actual day to-day reality. In fact, in Neusner's view, the publication of the Mishnah signals a retreat on the part of the rabbis from engagement in social and political concerns. In contrast, Rosen-Zvi and his colleagues see a constant tension within the Mishnah between a desire to engage the concerns presented by the reality that con fronted them and a desire to construct an alternative to that reality. Furthermore, for Neusner, the Mishnah's world is a static, philosophical construct whose operating assumptions are primarily metaphysical. The technical legal content of the Mishnah is just the packaging for these deeper concerns. For these more recent scholars, the world of the Mishnah is generally a narrative world 33. Beth A.

There is thus an essential continuity between the surface and deeper agendas of the Mishnah. The discourse of authority that these scholars see as pervading the Mishnah and its world emerges directly from the Mishnah's legal-centric con cerns. Law and political authority are, by definition, intimately related. Arguably, underlying any technical legal text can be found a set of larger political concerns. This search for extra- or meta-halakhic aspects of the Mishnah leads us to perhaps the most surprising contribution of recent Mishnah studies to the study of rabbinic literature as a whole: a reconsideration of the age-old question of the relationship between halakhah and Aggadah. The Mishnah is famously short on aggadic material. As such, we would not expect Mishnah studies to make a significant contribution to this discussion. However, these endeavors to read an ostensibly halakhic text through the broader lens of literary and cultural criticism has revealed the significant degree to which halakhic and aggadic agendas overlap. From this perspective, the law is not simply an abstract and ideal ized system but an integral part of a larger cultural network which is expressed through textual means. Given these assumptions, it is hardly surprising that we find that halakhic texts are intimately involved in the wider communal, existential, and metaphysical concerns reflected in other aspects of rabbinic culture. The study of this conceptual-ideological element of the Mishnah, for all its importance, also represents a potential pitfall for contemporary scholars. Because it is not explicitly articulated, it is difficult to even prove the existence, let alone determine the nature and content, of such a substratum. Students of the Mishnah are thus particularly prone to project their own conceptual and ideologi cal fantasies onto the surface of the Mishnah and then mistake them for artifacts that have been excavated from the text itself. The best way to mitigate this problem is for scholars to become vigilantly self-aware of the various and conflict ing agendas and preconceptions with which they come to the material, be they rooted in religious tradition, positivist convictions, or contemporary ideologies.
