Simonsohn's study of the relations of the apostolic see and the Jews in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance has appeared. Based on</page><page sequence="2">312 BOOK REVIEWS the meticulous editing of 3,250 papal bulls and letters published in six earlier volumes, the study has the advantage of resting on a very firm documentary foundation. For readers who are familiar with the documentary record, there is very little new here. What Simonsohn attempts-successfully to my mind-is the reorganization of the mass of material into analytical categories. After a long chronological essay in chapters 1 and 2 summarizing papal-Jewish relations, and detailing, among other matters, the rhythm of the issuance of the papal bull of protection, Sicut judeis, and its variants, he treats jurisdictional issues (chap. 3), moneylending (chap. 4), mission and conversion (chap. 5), polemics and disputations (chap. 6), the Inquisition (chap. 7), and the Jews in papal lands (chap. 8). A very brief conclusion follows. The index-a vital tool, since so many topics appear more than once in the various sections of the study-is published separately as the Pontifical Institute's Studies and Texts 110. The index volume has been supplemented with valuable additions and corrections and an indispensable bibliography (indispensable because the mode of citation in the full study is very abbreviated). What can be said about such a massive endeavor? Simonsohn is sensitive to the fact that the very impressiveness of the accomplishment might lead to some misperceptions. Despite everything he has discovered in the archives, his massive volumes of documents represent a very tiny proportion of all the documents issued by the popes (perhaps less than one percent of papal records or at least of material in the Vatican Archives; p. x). If quantity matters, then the status and treatment of Jews was not a high priority in papal concerns. The popes had (or thought that they had) a world to run: Jews were a very small part of that world. There were thorny problems because of the relationship of Judaism to Christianity, but by and large the popes had to concentrate on other matters. The mere existence of six volumes of surviving documents and a long analytic essay should not mislead medievalists and early modernists to think otherwise. A second caution: Simonsohn is insistent that the history of Jews in Catholic Europe is not solely the history of their relationship with the head of the Catholic Church. Yet, there certainly will be a tendency, because of the now easy availability of these records, for some scholars to write as if this were the case. He waxes hot on the dangers of such an approach. In his own words, "Little documentation remains to show what effect, if any, papal pronouncements and instructions actually had" (p. 462). After detailing some of the problems of determining what really was going on while pope after</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 313 pope spoke, Simonsohn continues: "a large measure of reservation is called for in regard to the information presented in the preceding chapters [of the study] and the conclusions drawn from it" (ibid.). The judiciousness of the quoted statements is indicative of the sober- minded judiciousness that pervades the text as a whole. This study, like the documents on which it is based, is a gold mine of material. The author is to be commended. William Chester Jordan Princeton University Princeton, N.J.</page></plain_text>
