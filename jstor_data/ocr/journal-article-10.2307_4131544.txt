<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael L. Morgan. Beyond Auschwitz: Post-Holocaust Jewish Thought in Amer- ica. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. xii, 288 pp. In Beyond Auschwitz, Michael Morgan has in effect woven together two dif- ferent kinds of narratives. The first narrative is utterly ordinary; thankfully, the sec- ond is utterly extraordinary. In the ordinary narrative, Morgan traces American Jewish philosophical and theological responses to the Holocaust from 1945 to the early 1980s. While the bulk of the book treats the work of five post-Holocaust thinkers-Richard Rubenstein, Eliezer Berkovits, Irving Greenberg, Arthur Cohen, and Emil Fackenheim-Mor- gan insists on reading these figures in their postwar American Jewish context. Mor- gan begins by showing how the work of Hannah Arendt and the writings of Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi led Americans to be critical of universals and to open them- selves to the uniqueness of the Shoah. He also shows how the vast majority of ear- ly postwar American Jewish theology, using Buber and Rosenzweig as aids in a spiritualist gaze upward, at first ignored the particular details of the Shoah, en- veloping them into an abstract rhetoric of "crisis." In this way, more than other ac- counts of post-Holocaust Jewish thought, Beyond Auschwitz is able to give the reader a sense of the extent to which post-Holocaust theology both appropriated and 391</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews interrupted the rhetoric of American Jewish thought in the 1940s and 1950s. But while this narrative is useful for its breadth and its ability to clarify the often diffi- cult arguments of post-Holocaust theology, a reader who knows Morgan's own acu- ity as a Jewish thinker may wonder what exactly is specifically philosophical in this book that would make it qualitatively different from a work of intellectual history. The second narrative that Morgan has offered answers this question. In look- ing broadly at the history of American Jewish thought and culture during this time period, Morgan succeeds in verifying the argument of Emil Fackenheim about the relationship between thought and history. As early as the 1961 essay "Metaphysics and Historicity," Fackenheim had used Hegelian and existentialist philosophy to argue that statements about that which transcends history are not invalidated by the doctrine of historicism. In showing that human existence is committed to both nat- uralism and idealism, Fackenheim warned of the pitfalls both of the thorough avoidance of history that we find in Buber and Rosenzweig and of the purely nat- uralist thought of Richard Rubenstein. Throughout the bulk of Beyond Auschwitz, the reader gets only hints that this second narrative is the fundamental one. Al- though Morgan states up front that his thesis is that "the novelty and significance of post-Holocaust Jewish thought concerns the relation between history and iden- tity and not the particular theological results that these thinkers develop" (p. viii), the need to tell the ordinary narrative of post-Holocaust American Jewish thought gets somewhat in the way of this thesis. It is primarily in Morgan's conclusion that we get a sense that the very existence of post-Holocaust Jewish thought and its struggle in thinking putatively timeless theological truths alongside the unique his- torical event of the Shoah is evidence for the dialectical return to history with which thinkers such as Andreas Huyssen and Richard Rorty have characterized postmodernity and its simultaneous rupture and continuity with the past. This means that Morgan reads for the tension between transcendence and historicity throughout, in order to show that Fackenheim's concerns are woven into the fabric of the American Jewish theological narrative. In the opening chapter on Hannah Arendt, Morgan brackets the issue of whether her analyses are correct or not. By turning to the 1960s debates about Eichmann in Jerusalem, Morgan shows (p. 26) that the importance of the work is that it "raised to consciousness a whole set of convictions about universal principles and the particularity of historical sit- uation." The chapter on early postwar American Jewish theology treats the appro- priation of Buber and Rosenzweig as sources for the rise of the rubric of "covenant theology." Although historically situated as a preliminary response to the Shoah, Morgan (p. 57f.) judges it unsatisfying because it was not dialectical enough. If the majority of religious Jews in the late 1940s and the 1950s were invested in the con- viction that an individual's identity in covenant can lead him or her to do and know the good, this only occluded the issues of human finitude and the human capacity for evil that Irving Kristol notably raised in his 1947 review of Milton Steinberg's Basic Judaism. Finally, in the chapter on religious critics of post-Holocaust theol- ogy in the 1970s, Morgan deflates most of their dismissals of history by claiming that they, too, are historically situated by the rise of the New Left. These chapters are the most successful in BeyondAuschwitz. In showing how the conversations in American Jewish theology are really conversations about the di- 392</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews alectical twists and turns of the relationship between revelation and history, the read- er is prepared to go along with Morgan when Fackenheim himself is presented as the culmination and synthesis of post-Holocaust thought, in his expression of this di- alectic leading to a post-Holocaust faith that always expresses itself in a "groping, troubled affirmation" (p. 195). And Morgan finds dialectical and historicist struc- tures throughout the writings of Rubenstein, Berkovits, Greenberg, and Cohen. While this means that he is able to read them all with a generosity that is not always to be found in post-Holocaust thought, such generosity might appear to be ground- ed primarily in their potential to verify Fackenheim's arguments. Despite their strengths, Rubenstein is too naturalist (p. 67) and voluntaristic (p. 107); Berkovits does not notice his own perspectivalism (p. 118); Greenberg's Zionism is insuffi- ciently theological (p. 135); and Cohen's historicism is not quite radical enough (pp. 150-51). Morgan's critique of Michael Wyschogrod is less compelling, mostly because it is primarily an assertion (p. 204) that Wyschogrod shows "a deep resis- tance to the historicity of Jewish existence and to its hermeneutical character." Al- though Morgan might have pointed out more clearly that this assertion carries weight because the entire story that Morgan tells is an argument against Wyschogrod's view, what is really called for in settling the debate between Wyschogrod and Fackenheim is a sustained analysis of the differing analyses of Heidegger found in Fackenheim's To Mend The World and Wyschogrod's The Body of Faith. However, this is a minor cavil. Framing the story of American postwar the- ology as a story of the dialectic between revelation and history allows Morgan to offer a philosophical argument as well as a historical narrative. Because his argu- ment is grounded in history, and not in technical readings of Hegel, Schelling, or Rosenzweig, it has a power that gives hope that its readers will learn what I believe to be its two primary lessons: First, the current popularity of Jewish spirituality is now the greatest vehicle by which American Jews forget what the Holocaust can teach about the historical dimension of our existence. Contemporary Jews, now "beyond Auschwitz," make leaps of faith and have a spiritual confidence that nei- ther the fact of the Holocaust, nor philosophy, nor especially the history of Amer- ican Jews' grappling with how to conceptualize Judaism after the Holocaust, can possibly justify. The second lesson comes from the decision to read Fackenheim as a postmodern thinker. For Morgan, while the Holocaust bids us to affirm ob- jectivity, the content of this objectivity is always revisable and up for grabs (p. 217): "all traditional narratives of Jewish life and Jewish history must be reevaluated, for any one might turn out on reflection to be a tool of oppression or a medium of dis- tortion." In this broadly pragmatic shift-one that implies that readers can and should question even the Zionism and the fragmentary messianism that we find in To Mend The World-Morgan offers his readers a welcome path beyond the usual contours of Fackenheim's thought.
