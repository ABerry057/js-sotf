Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989. xv, 154 pp. Poetics of Ascent is a provocative study of Ma'aseh Merkavah, an impor- tant text in Hekhalot literature. Ma'aseh Merkavah consists of prayers pur- portedly used by Rabbis Akiba, Ishmael, and Nehuniah to ascend to heaven, conjure angels of wisdom and Torah, and see the Divine Presence. These prayers are set into narrative and include poetry and elaborate, mys- terious magical names.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 219 Janowitz raises the appropriate question of how Ma'aseh Merkavah functions as a ritual text. As she observes, the process of ascent is expressed primarily not in ritual prescriptions, but in the form of framing reports attri- buted to the rabbis and purporting to describe past experiences. Her approach to this question is through the structuralist linguistic theories of M. Silverstein and R. Jakobson. These theories see parallelism as a wide- spread linguistic principle applying not only to poetry-in this case, the poetic prayers-but to the structure of texts themselves-here, the narrative reports by the rabbis. According to Janowitz, Ma'aseh Merkavah is a ritual text because the ideology of language use manifest primarily in the framing testimony entails the act of ascent: "Just as the verb promise means that an act of promising is taking place, so too . .. to say X is to ascend" (p. 13). The role of the magical names in the text and their processes of composition are analyzed and set against the background of a brief survey of rabbinic and cognate sources on the idea of the power of the name (pp. 83-98). The book includes a translation of Ma'aseh Merkavah based on one manuscript, with brief notes and a list of selected variants from other manuscripts. Appen- dices deal with "The Textual Evidence" and "Old Testament Theories of Language." The primary strengths of Poetics ofAscent lie in its theoretical considera- tion of the issues of ritual and magical language and its treatment of the role and semantics of the magical name in the text. Its approach is particularly interesting as an alternative to Scholem's model, which saw the texts as reports of the authors' personal experiences, and because it questions the conventional dichotomy of religion and magic in favor of a more encom- passing view of the function of ritual language. It does not primarily address questions of the historical implications of the literary nature of Ma'aseh Merkavah, of the prior development of the text, or of the immediate context in which the prayer materials arose. As a consequence of the structuralist method employed, by which the unit of analysis is the whole composition, Ma'aseh Merkavah is treated, in effect, as a unitary document reflecting a coherent ideology. In Janowitz's view, all elements and genres within the text-prayers, names, and nar- rative-contribute to this ideology. Janowitz thus sees homologies between the various stylistic elements of the text and its ideological aspects. Thus in her view, synonyms are piled up in the name formulae and poetry in the way the heavens are piled up in the cosmology. Likewise, the framing devices form "an indexical icon of the construction of the heavens" (p. 141, n. 26).</page><page sequence="3">220 BOOK REVIEWS Janowitz is correct that the narrative of Ma'aseh Merkavah ascribes a pragmatic or performative function to language, particularly to the hymns containing the magical names. However, we may ask whether all elements of the text reflect this same ideology of language and ascent. This question is occasioned by Peter Schaifer's recent research, which demonstrates the com- posite nature of Hekhalot literature, reflected in gross variations between manuscripts. Janowitz does acknowledge the composite nature of Ma'aseh Merkavah, and discusses redactional issues in an appendix. As she states in the introduction, "an analysis of some composite texts might fail to pro- gress, if the literary forms and their arrangements in the text had been dis- turbed or incompletely preserved" (p. 16). This problem, however, goes beyond the question of the state of preservation of an original text; rather it shifts the focus of interpretation to the varying forms of the text and its components. As Schaifer states, "the relationship of such a literary unit to a certain 'work' is of secondary importance" JSJ 14 (1983) 181. For example, one section of Ma'aseh Merkavah (?? 560-570 in P. Schaifer, Synopse zure Hekhalot-Literatur [Tilbingen, 1981]) does not concern the individual's ascent to heaven, but his cultivation of an angel of wisdom (Sar-Torah) who is to descend to him. This section is only an "ascent text" by virtue of its placement in the larger framework of Ma'aseh Merkavah, which probably occurred in the early Middle Ages. Likewise, internal analysis of many of the prayers does not lead to the conclusion that they were composed for the purposes attributed to them in the narrative. Thus it may be that Janowitz is describing not the inherent function and ideology of language use in all com- ponents of Ma'aseh Merkavah but certain properties of such passages which allowed the later redactors to see them as accomplishing the goal of ascent. Another problem raised by the text is that of observable context, an important factor in pragmatic analysis. Janowitz observes that Ma'aseh Merkavah is a "contextless text that cannot be located in a specific historical community" (p. 16). Her approach to this problem is to apply Silverstein's notion of "pragmatic entailment," by which the framework establishes its own context for the ritual. By this theory Janowitz demonstrates that the completed text depicts a context whereby Rabbis Ishmael, Akiba, and Nehuniah can achieve ascent by reciting the hymns. However, this account still leaves open the question of the historical context in which the text was to be used-the form-critic's Sitz-im-Leben. In general, the study would benefit from a greater consideration of more proximate, conventional factors lending meaning to the text. Ma'aseh</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 221 Merkavah makes extensive use of specific poetic techniques, such as various forms of parallelism and the coining of construct pairs (Seruf), current in liturgical and nonstatutory poetry of the talmudic era, in genres which are not associated with the theme of ascent. The "poetics" referred to in Poetics of Ascent are not these techniques, which are not analyzed in any detail, but the more abstract, structural properties of the text. The role of liturgical forms and references, which are prominent in the text, is not explored in depth. These remarks notwithstanding, Poetics of Ascent is a stimulating book. It raises issues which merit consideration by students of Hekhalot literature and of ritual texts in general. Michael D. Swartz University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va.</page></plain_text>
