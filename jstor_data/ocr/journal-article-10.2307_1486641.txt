<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gary A. Abraham. Max Weber and the Jewish Question: A Study) of the Social Outlook of His Sociology. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992. xii, 319 pp. This book is a revised and enlarged version of a 1987 University of Pittsburgh dissertation. It is a selected study of the social and intellectual background of texts written by Max Weber about social minority groups in Germany with special regard to the Jews. Gary Abraham's central effort is to bring to bear on Weber's writings recent research in the relevant areas of German intellectual and social history. The author wishes to show that Weber's sociology of the Jews developed out of his concept of a nation as a cultural unity. Weber's sociological analysis was dominated by the value of</page><page sequence="2">282 BOOK REVIEWS "national unity" which consequencently led to a devaluation of the rights and values of social minorities. Abraham's train of thought clearly has been schooled by his own thesis, namely, that Weber's sociology of Judaism should be derived from the controversial questions discussed during the Second Reich: questions con- cerning Polish immigration into West Prussia, the stream of Russian Jews into Germany, and the assimilation of German Jews. The work is arranged coherently. An extensive introduction (pp. 1-33) is followed by two parts, "Society and Science" (pp. 37-173) and "Religion and Society" (pp. 177-266); these are followed by conclusions (pp. 267-293), a bibliography (pp. 299-308), and a combined person-subject index (pp. 309-317). The main sources of the first part are Weber's writings on the landworker question, his inaugural in Freiburg, and the biography of Marianne Weber. The relevant writings of Wolfgang Mommsen, Fritz Ringer, and Uriel Tal are used as secondary literature. Weber's statements on the questions of landworkers/Polish immigration, minorities, and assimilation/emancipation of Jews are brought into relation with his concept of national unity. The results of sociological and historical research on the period of the Second Reich are reviewed in detail and used to support the thesis that Weber's ideal of a national civic society (Kulturstaat) prevented appropriate attention being given to the minorities and an analysis of their sociological situation. Abraham makes the criticism that Weber's concept of modern society excludes a pluralism characterized by different ethnic and national groups. "For Weber, social unification in Germany had to be based on acceptance of a common culture and the hegenomy of a dominant ethnic group." Weber tied the ethnic nationality of Germany to German culture. In the fourth chapter ("Weber's Idea of Universal History"), Weber's position on universal history is critically reviewed. The most important sources for Abraham are the introduction to Weber's "The Sociology of Religion," and the two articles "Roscher and Knies: Logical Problems of Historical Economics" and "Objectivity in Social Science and Social Policy." Abraham sees a casual relationship between Weber's principle of value neutrality and his concept of universal history. In this respect he follows the previous criticism of others and enlarges upon it. Weber's methodological attempts to show that ideal types have universality and validity overlook the inherent conflict between the norm of empirical inquiries which can be</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 283 checked and cultural values which condition contemporary interest. Weber's analysis of cultural values does not take account of the fact that historical discourse is of a social nature and therefore limited by that which those who take part consider to be common culture. For this reason the evaluative basis of such concepts as "pariah-people" or 'status" escape Weber's consciousness. Part II, "Religion and Society," includes chapters entitled "Religion and 'Rationalism' in The Protestant Ethic" (chap. 6, pp. 190-206), "Sombart's Sociology of the Jews" (chap. 7, pp. 207-227), and "Weber's Pariah-People Thesis in His Sociology" (chap. 8, pp. 228-266). The considerations in chapters 6 and 7 pursue the aim of making Weber's work on the rise of occidental rationalism understandable as a result of his preoccupation with the writings of Werner Sombart. Especially in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and in his treatment of Judaism in the "Sociology of Religion" section of Economy and Society, Weber is seen to have defended his concept of the genesis of the capitalistic spirit from Calvinistic professional ethics against Sombart's position that the spirit of capitalism sprang from Jewish rationalism. Contrary to Sombart, Weber would attribute to Judaism only a marginal role in the birth of capitalism. Weber's "distinction between 'calculability' and 'religious rationalism' leads to the claim that Jewish ascetic or 'ethical' rationalism is confined to internal social relations within the Jewish community" (p. 227). By chapter 8 we reach the actual thesis of the book. Abraham's explications rest substantially on a comparison of the two versions of The Protestant Ethic with the "Sociology of Religion" and "Non-Legitimate Domination" sections of Economy and Society. Weber's study Ancient Judaism plays a minor role in the argumentation. The author stresses the relationship between Weber's view of the Jews as a pariah-people and the distinctiveness of this against Sombart's theory. Following the criticism of J. Taubes, E. Shmueli, Tal, and others, Abraham refers to the inappropriateness of such conceptualization, as well as to the dependence of Weber's pariah thesis on the Christian theology of his time. Otherwise he tries to show that Weber's understanding of the Jews as a pariah-people had a direct impact on his conceptualization of the formation of groups. Since Weber held that a nation is to be qualified not only ethnically but, mainly, by its striving for political dominance, he was obliged to deny the Jews the consciousness of being a nation. The pariah concept allowed him to characterize the Jewish people as possessing a special character without granting them the status of a nationality. A pariah-people and a nation are</page><page sequence="4">284 BOOK REVIEWS homologous phenomena in Weber's thought. The pariah-people is the most extreme example of a national minority and differs from a nation only in size. Abraham's attempt to attribute Weber's considerations on the social structure of Judaism to the social and intellectual context of the Second Reich, and to approach them from that angle, point in the right direction. His thesis that Weber's assumption of the pariah character of the Jewish people supplies an answer to inner political problems of the Second Reich is wildly exaggerated. He simply has not succeeded in verifying this from actual texts of Weber's. The pariah-people thesis (not theory) plays only a marginal role in Weber's Ancient Judaism, a work which is only touched upon by Abraham.' In other writings, it turns up almost exclusively in late revisions, as a reaction to Sombart's thesis. It is therefore to be welcomed that the author has placed the intellectual and social relationships between Sombart and Weber at the center of his study. The author relies on Weber's writings nearly exclusively in their English translations and whenever possible prefers the German and French literature in English translation. This (and the circumstance that second-hand citations often are given in abbreviated and distorted form) facilitates the presentation of the thesis that Weber's sociology of Judaism rests on subtle antisemitic preconceptions. But at the same time it greatly reduces the value of his work. The citation of non-English book titles in ad hoc English translations and the lack of further bibliographical information are both puzzling. Many names and phrases are cited in a form which is linguistically incorrect or impossible, not once or twice, but repeatedly throughout the book. It is also strange that the author does not use the standard critical editions of Weber's work in his citations.
