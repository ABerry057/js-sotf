Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1994. xii, 156 pp. To what extent can a religious system dominated by halakhah recognize the legitimacy of a Jewish ethic which, though consistent with halakhah, is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 435 not legal in character? What is the nature of such an ethic, and how are we to understand its relationship to the halakhic process, which is rooted, according to the tradition, in divine revelation? And how does this distinctively Jewish ethic compare to the ethical theories of prominent philosophers and Christian thinkers? These are the questions which frame Walter Wurzburger's latest and most ambitious attempt to formulate a theory of Jewish ethics within the context of modem Orthodox thought. Drawing on traditional Jewish sources as well as a wide range of non-Jewish ethical thinkers, Wurzburger constructs a covenantal Jewish ethic which affirms both the absolute authority of halakhah and the necessity for a subjective, intuitive component in Jewish ethical life. While the internal consistency of his views may be questioned, arguably no one since Joseph Soloveitchik (to whom Wurzburger is explicitly indebted) has offered us such a full account of a traditional, yet pluralistic, Jewish ethic. Wurzburger's thesis is that "intuitive ethical beliefs play a central role in the halakhic system" (p. 4) alongside formal legal elements. More specifically, he suggests that there are situations "that do not come within the purview of explicit legal norms," or where existing norms contain an element of ambiguity (p. 29). It is here, Wurzburger argues, that the subjective, intuitive element of Jewish ethics enters. Such an ethic is covenantal in Martin Buber's (or Eugene Borowitz's) sense of arising out of a living relationship with God. It is an ethic of personal responsibility, shaped by "the residual influence of exposure to halakhic categories. . .in areas where the law itself cannot be applied" (p. 33). In support of his thesis, Wurzburger marshals an impressive array of sources relating to the importance of personal piety, the role of broad values, such as "acting for the sake of peace" (mipneh darkhei shalom), and the categories of "extra-halakhic" responsibilities (middat hasidim and lifnim mishurat hadin). He suggests that traditional Jewish thinkers have long recognized the existence of this subjective dimension within Jewish ethical life, and that "meticulous observance of halakhic norms does not exhaust the meaning of Jewish piety" (p. 31). Principles such as concern for the welfare of society, Wurzburger argues, operate both within and alongside the halakhic process. The irreducibly subjective element in this covenantal ethic is the source of its pluralistic character. Unlike halakhic rulings, which are objective and are understood as the authoritative expresion of God's will, the ethic of virtue that Worzburger expounds is personal. When halakhah offers no explicit guidance,</page><page sequence="3">436 BOOK REVIEWS or when obligations are in conflict with one another, each individual must make an ethical decision that is at once shaped by the tradition but also lacking the objective validity of halakhah. The fact that different equally learned Jews will make these decisions differently provides the pluralistic dimension of Jewish ethics. Wurzburger's theory, while compelling in many respects, overlooks some potentially significant issues and leaves some important questions unan- swered. How, for example, does halakhah as a legal system compare to other systems of law, especially religious law? Given that part of Wurzburger's argument rests on his observation that moral principles function alongside legal rules within Judaism, it is unfortunate that he has not examined this issue in parallel religious/legal systems or drawn more explicitly from discussions in contemporary jurisprudence, especially the work of Ronald Dworkin. Wurzburger's own analysis would benefit from greater engagement with the literature in philosophy of law. Of greater concern is the extent to which Wurzburger's effort to carve out a middle course between rigid legalism and liberal subjectivism stands up to critical scrutiny. On the one hand, he insists that Torah, inclusive of both the written and the oral law, is a system of divinely revealed teachings, but at the same time that Israel is not a "passive recipient of divine teachings, but a partner with God in the creation of the Oral Torah."(p. 7). But just how do we distinguish the human and so inevitably fallible component of this Oral Torah from the divine and absolutely true component? Similarly, he asserts that "the fact that Covenantal Ethics operates with intuitions that represent value judgments arising from specific historic-cultural situations does not weaken its claim to universal validity" (ibid.). But how can the historically contingent and subjective element not compromise the professed universal validity of a moral system? Wurzburger's claims here remind one of the assertions in M. Avot that "all is foreseen, but free will is given" (3:19). The assertion that something is true cannot substitute for analysis and resolution of the apparent contradiction. Finally, Wurzburger gives only passing consideration to the possibility that the relationship between halakhah and ethics as he understands them may shift over time. He notes, for example, an instance in which acts of altruism may become legally enforceable obligations (p. 46). But this, like many examples of lifnim mishurat hadin, is considered by some authorities to be extralegal and so indicative of exceptional piety, but by others as a legal duty fully binding upon everyone. As I have argued elsewhere, the boundaries</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 437 between legal and ethical norms in Judaism have always been fluid, for reasons which lie at the heart of classical Jewish theology.' Wurzburger's analysis would be richer if he explored this fluidity and also if he acknowledged the tensions between law and ethics in Judaism. his apparent reluctance to do so may reflect his abiding commitment to Orthodoxy and its insistence upon understanding Judaism as fully internally consistent. However one assesses the success of Wurzburger's effort here, however, one cannot but admire the breadth of his learning and the intellectual integrity of his enterprise. These, combined with the clarity of his arguments and his extensive notes, make this an important contribution to contemporary Jewish ethics. Whether the "middle ground" that he defines can hold remains an open question, but one which can be more clearly addressed with the help of this thought-provoking volume. Louis E.
