<plain_text><page sequence="1">Laura Zittrain Eisenberg. My Enemy 's Enemy: Lebanon in the Early Zionist Imagination, 1900-1918. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1994. 219 pp. Israel's debacle in Lebanon in 1982 propelled many researchers and historians to examine its policy toward Lebanon in general and the Maronite community in particular. Numerous books and articles have been published in the last decade reviewing Israel's involvement in Lebanon during the 1975-76 civil war, its invasion in 1982, the siege of Beirut and the eventual forced withdrawal from most of Lebanon three years later. Laura Z. Eisenberg's initial interest in Israel's policy toward Lebanon was also sparked by her presence in Israel in June 1982. She chose, however, to focus her research on the roots of the Zionist movement's policy toward the Maronites in Lebanon until 1948, namely, before the establishment of the State of Israel. Details on the unique relationship between the Zionist movement in Palestine and the Maronite community in Lebanon in the 1930s and 1940s had already been published, including in the memoirs of Eliyahu Elath (Epstein), who had been one of the main architects of this alliance. Eisenberg, however, is the first to present a comprehensive study of the Zionist-Maronite alliance in the prestate years. Eisenberg relied overwhelmingly on Zionist sources, in particular the Central Zionist Archives. She justifiably chose to limit her research to the Zionist policy toward Lebanon and the Maronites, and refrained from entering into the fractious nature of Lebanese and Maronite confessional politics. A more thorough examination of the motives of the Maronite leaders, both religious and secular, who advocated close cooperation with the Jews in Palestine, would undoubtedly have provided a better understanding of this relationship. But even so, she has succeeded in presenting a concise</page><page sequence="2">422 BOOK REVIEWS but accurate picture of the Maronites' ideological, economic, and political motives for seeking an alliance with the Zionist movement. The author defines three periods in the development of Zionist interest in Lebanon before 1948: an early encounter before World War I and during the 1920s after the establishment of Greater Lebanon; the close cooperation during the 1930s in light of the common interests of the two nationalist movements-Jewish Zionist and Christian Lebanese-that confronted the strong opposition of the Arab Muslim majority; and the 1940s, during which the Zionist leadership became increasingly disillusioned with their Maronite allies' inability to concretize their commitments. The most significant of these periods was the 1930s, when the Zionists had high expectations from their ties with the prominent Maronite leaders, particularly Emile Edd6, then president of the Lebanese Republic. It must be noted, however, that this was an extremely difficult period in the history of the Zionist movement, which was then struggling to realize the national aspirations of the Jews for a homeland in Palestine at the time of the violent Arab revolt (1936-39) and Britain's hesitant and increasingly pro-Arab policy. The Zionist leaders' tendency to overestimate the Maronites' friendly overtures is therefore understandable. Indeed, it was during this period that the concept of the "alliance of minorities," namely, the cultivation of close cooperation with non-Muslim or non-Arab minorities in the region against the common enemy-the Arab-Muslim nationalist movement--emerged. This concept was to dominate Israel's regional policy well after 1948. Eisenberg has done an excellent job of describing the processes which led to the development of this concept in Israeli policy. Although she is careful not to refer to it explicitly, it can be argued that the close Zionist-Maronite ties before 1948 played not an insignificant role in the decision of Israeli governments to renew their historic relationship with the Maronite community in the 1970s and early 1980s. Eisenberg criticizes the Zionist leaders' "faulty" policy toward the Ma- ronites, and their unrealistic expectations. It seems that in the 1940s these leaders, including David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharett, were far more realistic and had fewer expectations from the Maronite's overtures compared with the Israeli government of 1982, which led its country into a disastrous war based on undeliverable promises by Bashir Jemayel and other Maronite leaders with regard to a close political and military alliance with Israel. Nevertheless, Eisenberg has written an excellent work comprising a valuable and important contribution to existing literature on the shaping of Israel's</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 423 "foreign policy" toward the Arab world in general, and toward Lebanon and the Maronites in particular, in the prestate years.
