<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF JUDAIC LAWS IN THE ANTIQUITIES OF JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL OF QUMRAN by DAVID ALTSHULER Yigael Yadin's publication of the Temple Scroll (Ts) from Qumran is a pioneering work of scholarship that will stimulate a generation of further research. At this relatively early date, most attention naturally will focus on understanding the scroll itself and its place within Qumran literature. Alongside these concerns, however, are many tantalizing prospects for com- parative study, through which the literature and life of Qumran might illumine the larger context of Judaism in late antiquity. Clearly, for example, the way TS treats biblical law is of both intrinsic and comparative significance. This study is a preliminary contribution to a fertile area for future investigations. Yadin has observed that Josephus in his Antiquities (AJ) and the author of TS both present laws of the Torah classified by subjects. Yadin goes on to argue that his purported Essene upbringing (Vita 9-12) may have influenced Josephus in this work.' This claim offers an alternative view to 1.

(Jerusalem, 1977), 1:62, 93-94, 305. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID ALTSHULER the still disputed notion that it was Pharisaic training that gave Josephus his approach to biblical law.2 Leaving aside the unresolved questions about Josephus's sectarian affi- liation, we may observe that AJ and Ts are clearly different in several important ways. First of all, the two works were written perhaps two cen- turies apart, with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and the annihila- tion of the Qumran community intervening.3 Secondly, AJ is a Greek work largely dependent on the LXX or a similar version of the Torah,4 while Ts is written in Hebrew by an author who undoubtedly worked from a Hebrew Bible. Moreover, treatment of the law is but a dependent section of AJ, whereas the law constitutes the whole of Ts. Finally, the two texts address different audiences for different purposes: AJ is a historical apologetic meant for non-Jewish readers, while Ts is a pseudepigraphic work of "revelation" which its sectarian author(s) and readers presumably regarded as sacred.5 Nevertheless, the recently published Ts invites comparison with the "Constitution of Moses" presented in AJ Books 3 and 4 for various reasons. Josephus, descended from priestly lines on both his parents' sides, clearly shares with the author of Ts a special interest in the Temple and the State. Furthermore, AJ is one of the few firmly attributed and dated ancient discus- sions of Jewish law. Lastly, there has developed already a considerable body of scholarship on the laws in AJ and their parallels in other ancient Jewish literature.6 Here I shall begin with a description and analysis of the "Constitution of Moses" in AJ-how does the classification of law by Josephus, together with his other editorial techniques, reveal the larger purpose in AJ? Next I shall try to uncover the principles and purposes of the legal materials in Ts. Finally, I shall offer tentative comments on the value of these findings for the comparative issues raised by Yadin. *k * * 2. I have surveyed the literature on this question and argued that legal material in AJ is of little use in establishing a Pharisaic identity for Josephus.

As in Scripture, so in AJ, legal materials are fitted into a framework provided by blocks of narrative, first from Exodus, then from Numbers, and finally from Deuteronomy (see chart below). The legal paragraphs, however, are arranged topically, rather than by the sequence of Scripture. Josephus admits (4:197) as much for 4:199-301; clearly, this has been his procedure throughout. With few excep- tions, 3:102-286 and 4:67-75 treat priestly materials, while 4:199-301 focuses on the Covenant and Deuteronomic Codes.

Josephus carefully separates the laws of Exodus 25-40, Leviticus and Num- bers (AJ 3:102-286; cf. 4:67-75) from those of Exodus 20-28 and Deuter- onomy (AJ 4:199-301). The former collection includes mostly cultic and particularistic regulations, while the latter is more civil-secular in nature and contains many universalistic ethical precepts. Three contrasts are apparent: 1) Without exception, Josephus narrates the laws of Exodus 25-40, Leviti- cus and Numbers in indicative verbs, but he phrases the laws of Exodus 20-23 and Deuteronomy in imperatives. While neither collection is in strictly biblical form, the laws in Book 3 read like customs the Jews once practiced or now happen to observe (cf. Lev. 1:1, 4:1 !), but those in Book 4 sound very much like the commands of God through Moses as described in Deuteronomy. 2) With the exception of the discursus on symbolism of the tabernacle and vestments (3:179-187) and the passage about Moses and leprosy (3:265-266), no extrabiblical apologetics are added to the legal collection in Book 3. Book 4, however, is replete with apologetics. God's will and the pleasure of nature are cited as reasons, for example, for many agricultural and property laws in Book 4. There, too, societal benefits, instead of purity or holiness considerations, are cited to support biblical laws concerning pilgrimages (4:204), prostitution (4:206), fitness to bear witness (4:219), levirate marriage (4:254), injuries resulting in a miscarriage (4:278), and eunuchs (4:290). Certainly the themes of Holy City, Holy Temple, and Holy Law are extolled in Book 4, but the actual practices of the sacrificial cult are virtually ignored there. Where Book 3 does explain the workings of the daily and festival sacri- fices, there is not a word of praise for the system or the Law.</page><page sequence="5">LAWS IN JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL 5 3) Josephus mentions sanctions with great frequency in recounting the laws of Exodus and Deuteronomy (4:202, 219, 238, 248, 251, 252, 264, 271, 277, 279, 281, 282, 284); only 3:273 and 275 are comparable. The contrasts in force between these two AJ collections well demon- strate Josephus's prowess as an apologist for Judaism. So too, his intermediate system of subject-classification subtly enhances the apologetic character of AJ's catalogue of biblical law. While certain cate- gories, like sacrificial and family rules, emerge only slightly reorganized from Scripture, Josephus creates other collections from passages scattered in the Bible in order to highlight important themes. For example, AJ's account of purity laws (3:258-279) is drawn from some fifteen chapters of Leviticus and Numbers. The laws are arranged topically: a narrative introduction, general ordinances about food and "diseased persons," more specific rules for women after childbirth and suspected adulteresses, and finally purity laws that do not involve sacrifices. Josephus here creates a category of laws wholly unorganized in Scripture, and to this collection he adds the most forceful apologetic comments on legal matters in AJ Book 3. The purpose of this focused discussion on purity is to surround Josephus's long polemic against anti-Semitic claims that Moses was a leper (3:265-268); Josephus accumulates these purity laws and emphasizes their Mosaic authorship (3:258, 259, 260, 261, 264, 273, 274, 277, 280) in order to drive home his criticism of anti-Semitic versions of the Exodus story. A similar topical arrangement of diverse biblical laws is found in AJ 4:225-243, where agricultural laws are listed beginning with boundary marks, planting, then harvesting and sharing the harvest. This section is greatly expanded by Josephus in apologetic passages (4:225, 228-230, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237) without parallel in Scripture. The leading theme here is that Israel is obligated to share her bounties with all-even for- eigners! To crown his focus on the importance of agricultural laws, Josephus interprets the Deuteronomic law of lashes to apply specifically to these mat- ters of farming (4:238). The apologetic tendencies of Josephus extend, of course, not only to his arrangement of Books 3 and 4 and to the composition of their intermediate sections, but also to his selection and interpretation of individual laws with- in this corpus. While he claims (4:196) to have reproduced all the laws of Moses without omitting or adding anything, more than 600 verses in biblical laws have no parallel in AJ, and more than 400 lines of AJ have no parallel in Scripture.</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID ALTSHULER A glance at subjects Josephus omits makes clear his attempt to mute xenophobic and cultic-exclusiveness themes. He simply glosses over scores of verses on false gods and altars, mediums and wizards, child-sacrifice, non-Hebrew slaves, and the taking of interest from foreigners. In a similar vein, he uses the LXX version of Exod. 22:28 (cf. MT Exod. 22:27 and Deut. 7:25) to assert that Jews are forbidden to revile foreign gods and temples (4:207). Two examples may illustrate the care with which Josephus supplements Scripture for apologetic purposes. Many scholars have noted his extension of the biblical injunction against misleading the blind into a law that demands giving accurate travel directions to those who are lost; this passage (AJ 4:276) seems to refute directly a claim repeated by Juvenal in Satire 14 ("[the Jew is taught] not to show the way to the traveler who does not prac- tice the same rites"). Josephus also seems to contradict Juvenal in another passage not cited as apologetic by earlier scholars. In 4:283 he states explicit- ly what Exod. 21:33-34 implies, that those who dig wells should keep them covered. Josephus goes on to explain that this law is for purposes of safety, and not to preclude anyone from drawing water. This interpolation contrasts with Juvenal's claim, again in Satire 14 ("[he is taught] to lead only the cir- cumcised to the fountain"). Such apologetic revision of Scripture is re- inforced by Josephus in his repeated evaluations of the laws or lawful deeds with such words as "good" (4:204, 210, 239, 258) and "just" (3:250; 4:205, 212, 233, 258, 266). In sum, the classification of biblical law by Josephus in AJ Books 3 and 4 serves the larger apologetic goals of his magnum opus. Through a variety of editorial and interpretive techniques, Josephus drives home the theme artic- ulated in his introduction: "Speaking generally, the main lesson to be learnt from the history by any who care to peruse it is that men who conform to the will of God, and do not venture to transgress laws that have been excel- lently laid down, prosper in all things beyond belief, and for reward are offered by God felicity" (1:14). This certainly is a biblical conception of his- tory (cf. Deut. 28:1-6), and whatever motives Josephus displays elsewhere in Antiquities, 4:199-301 is a hymn to the theme of Deuteronomy: God pro- vides for those who obey his law (4:199, 201, 205, 213, 215, 217, 223, 224, 225, 232, 235, 237, 239, 241, 262, 266, 267, 286, 288, 290, 292, 294, 295). Several factors require that our analysis of Ts be considerably more</page><page sequence="7">LAWS IN JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL 7 tentative than that of AJ. First of all, the text itself, despite Yadin's recon- struction efforts, remains fragmented; critical sections, including the begin- ning, end, and important transition paragraphs, are lost.' Moreover, Yadin admits to having treated halakhic issues only briefly in his commentary,9 and the time that has passed since his publication has not been sufficient for much more detailed scholarship to have been produced. However, the pro- visional comments that follow may at least demonstrate directions for future inquiry. Broadly speaking, TS treats two issues: the holy Temple, city, and land (3-5 1:10), and the holy nation (51:11-end). As Yadin notes, the majority of laws here are drawn from the Torah, arranged topically but also by and large in the order of Scripture: first from Exodus, then Leviticus and Num- bers, and finally from Deuteronomy. The following chart summarizes the intermediate units of TS:'?

The general structure of Ts demonstrates the aptness of the name Yadin has given it. TS is, above all, an essay on the spatial nature of holiness. God dwells in the land of Israel and among the people of Israel, and God's laws are arranged in TS so as to emphasize both the analogy between land and people as loci of holiness, and the cosmological and anthropological cen- tralization that emanates from God's choice of sanctuary and national leadership. The introduction to TS posits the conditional nature of the covenant between God and Israel. The right to dwell in the land is predicated on Israel's willingness to abide by God's laws, and such a lawful existence will be in direct contrast to the "abominations" practiced by foreign nations who are to be driven from the land. The first set of specific responsibilities described relates to the holy sanctuary, whose rules are drawn primarily from those applied by Exodus to the wilderness tabernacle."' Next come the sacrificial rites to be performed at the sanctuary altar; taken generally from Leviticus and Numbers, these rituals are listed by order of frequency- daily, weekly, monthly, and then seasonally beginning in the first (spring) month.12 After the conclusion of the festal calendar, Ts resumes describing the Temple, first the rooms of the inner court in the order of their proximity to the sanctuary, then the more distant courtyards. These rules lead up to a list of those who may not enter the Temple area because of their impurity, and finally to mention of the outermost terrace and wall surrounding the Temple area. The vast majority of this material has no parallel in the Torah, or for that matter elsewhere in Scripture.'3 11. Yadin, 1:70, 137-39 argues that the scriptural support of TS is 1 Chron. 28:11-21, esp. v. 19. 12. Yadin, 1: 71-72. Here Yadin posits Neh. 10:33-35 as the scriptural justification for the "Torah of appointed times and their offerings." 13. Yadin, 1: 137-214. It is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate Yadin's comparisons of Ts with other schemes of the Temple. We simply may note that as a historian Josephus distin- guished between the Tabernacle of Moses (described in AJ Books 3 and 4) and the Temple of Solomon (AJ 8:61-98). The latter is Yadin's concern (see 1: 150-52); the former, our own.</page><page sequence="9">LAWS IN JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL 9 TS concludes its discussion of issues related to the Temple by describing places outside the city to be reserved for persons who are ritually impure, then by surveying rules of impurity (e.g., relating to animals and corpses) that apply throughout the land. These latter regulations derive largely from Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14.14 This unit on purity concludes the four segments in TS devoted to the Temple and related matters. Here, as in the scroll's introduction, Israel's exclusive relationship with God is emphasized: "For I, Yahweh, dwell amidst the children of Israel. You shall keep your- selves holy and not contaminate yourselves through anything from which I have separated you, declaring them to be unclean. You shall be holy" (51:7-10). The remainder of TS treats the holiness of Israel as a national entity. Here the issue of centralization focuses discussion first on the systems of authority-judicial, priestly, monarchic and prophetic institutions-then on the practices of the nation as a whole. The structure of these two sections follows Deut. 16:18-18:22, then Deut. 19:15ff., respectively. The topical interests of TS are evident primarily in 51:19-56:5, which brings material from Leviticus, Numbers and earlier chapters of Deuteronomy to supple- ment the discussion in Deut. 16:21-17:13 regarding the exclusivity of the national cult; similarly, Ts 56:12-59:21 expands upon the laws of kingship in Deut. 17:14-20 by adding materials from elsewhere in the Torah, and from other biblical and extrabiblical sources.'5 Otherwise, the central national institutions and the regulations of national life proceed directly parallel to Deuteronomy until the scroll's defective end. The foregoing brief summary of the topical arrangement of laws in TS suggests that the scroll sets forth two parallel "maps," first of the land and then of the nation. In each case, the core (Temple, systems of authority) is described first, then the reader is led outward to related, but less central, concerns. As noted above, both the scroll's introduction and the conclusion of the first "map" emphasize the exclusivity of Israel's covenant with God; this theme is underscored as well at several other important junctures. Thus 29:2-30:2 concludes the description of sacrifices, 46:11-12 closes the dis- 14. Yadin, 1: 215-263. Yadin notes scriptural support for this section in Isa. 52:1. Yadin notes (p. 216) that TS traces purity laws from the most strict to the most lenient, whereas rab- binic texts are in the opposite order. On the relation of Qumran purity laws in general (though not in TS) with those of the Mishnah, cf. Jacob Neusner, A History of the Mishnaic Laws of Purity, 23 vols. (Leiden, 1977), 22: 101-9, 298. 15. Yadin, 1: 70-71, 264-77. Yadin cites 1 Sam. 10:25 as scriptural support for this collec- tion.</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID ALTSHULER cussion of the Temple courtyards, and 59:16-21 completes the laws of monarchy-each with exhortations, drawn from diverse scriptures, that stress the need to preserve Israel's special holiness. Similarly, within each topical collection are numerous examples of scriptural quotations and para- phrases that develop this theme (e.g., "eternal laws" in 17:3, 24:5; "sanctify my people" in 33:6; "do not defile my sanctuary . . . it shall be a holy of holies forever" in 35:7-9; "forever, all the days I dwell among them" in 46:4; "eat no abomination for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God" in 48:7; "do not do in your land what the nations do" in 51:19; "you shall destroy the evil from your midst" in 66:3, etc.). The homiletical structure and rhetoric of Ts mirror the general tenden- cies of its editors in selecting and expanding legal material from the Torah. In discussing the Sabbath and festivals, for example, TS omits virtually all nonsacrificial ordinances (e.g., Exod. 31:12-17), as well as regulations for the sabbatical and jubilee years (Lev. 25), but it goes beyond the Torah to prescribe annual commemoration of the eight days of installation for the priests (15:3-17:4), and various sacrificial customs related to first fruits (especially 21:12-25:1). Nearly one fourth of TS is devoted to the Temple courtyards, and virtually none of these laws has a parallel in the Torah. In matters of purity, as well, Ts deletes little from the Torah but adds much, e.g., various constructions to maintain the Temple's purity (46:1-47:3), the prohibition of bringing skins into the Temple (47:7-18), and of course the general principle of extending purity regulations applied by the Torah to the Tabernacle here described as pertaining to the Temple and indeed to cities throughout the land. As TS sets out the national institutions of Israel, it supplements Deuteronomy with several provisions. The king may not marry a foreigner (57:15-16); a council of thirty-six "chiefs," priests and Levites must advise him in judgment (57:11-15); and he must consult the 'urim and tummim of the high priest before going into battle (58:15-59:1). Finally, the concluding section of Ts expands Scripture by requiring the segregation of female captives for seven years (63:14-15), and linking the death penalty of Deut. 21:22-23 with treason (64:6-13). Noticeably absent from this section are many universalistic and noncultic Torah laws, e.g., the Decalogue, com- mandments regarding slaves and damages (Exod. 21:1-36; Lev. 24:17-22), and requirements to be compassionate toward aliens, widows, orphans and the poor (Exod. 22:21-25; Lev. 19:9-14; Deut. 24:10-15). The net effect of these omissions and additions is to make Ts even more cult-centered and exclusivist than the Torah upon whose legal passages it generally is based.</page><page sequence="11">LAWS IN JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL 11 Having examined AJ and Ts each on its own terms, we may now proceed to evaluate Yadin's suggestion of possible source and derivation. The super- ficial but significant contrasts noted above-that the works are not contem- poraneous, that they began with different versions of the Bible which they interpreted for different reasons to different audiences-take on still greater import in light of the thematic and editorial tendencies just surveyed. Whereas TS seeks to emphasize the particularity of Israel, a cult and nation set apart from the abominations of foreigners, AJ tones down biblical themes of exclusivity and heightens instead laws that are universalistic and ethical in nature. Perhaps symptomatic of the divergence of these two approaches is the way the two texts treat Moses. TS excludes the lawgiver entirely, in many instances converting laws to the first person in order to emphasize the direct covenantal link between God and Israel.'6 Josephus, on the other hand, mentions Moses by name some two dozen times in the course of his legal passages (AJ 3:106, 107, 108, 137, 156, 188, 196, 204, 209, 210, 211, 212, 222, 258, 265, 267, 268, 273, 280, 285, 286; 4:67, 74; cf. 4:196-197, 302), alludes to "the lawgiver" throughout, and argues on several occasions that the "vir- tue" of the "constitution" and its tradent are consonant (AJ 1:18-23; cf. passim). Nowhere in AJ legal materials is God quoted directly. Indeed, the purpose and program of AJ could not be more different from that of TS. The following table should suffice to demonstrate, furthermore, that not even one of the topical units in AJ could owe its editorial structure to TS: AJ 3:102-223 Josephus consistently makes clear that he is describing the Tabernacle, while TS speaks always of the Temple. AJ 3:108-133 begins on the outside and works inward; TS 3-46 does the reverse. AJ 3:151-187, the longest passage here, is devoted to the priestly garments, which do not figure at all in TS. AJ 3:204-211 describes a one- time ceremony of inauguration, while TS 15-17 pre- scribes an annual commemoration. 3:224-257 AJ 3:224-235, following Lev. 1-6, treats sacrificial procedures generally before describing the schedule of daily, weekly, and seasonal rites; Ts 34-35 discusses the burnt offering afterward, while describing the slaughtering room, and otherwise offers only scattered 16. Yadin, 1: 61.</page><page sequence="12">12 DAVID ALTSHULER comments on sin-offerings, etc. AJ 3:236 proscribes sacrificing an animal and its parent together (as Lev. 22:28), a law found in Ts 52, amid miscellaneous priest- ly regulations. AJ 3:237-238 and TS 13-14 follow Numbers 28 in listing sacrifices for every day, Sab- baths and New Moons. But AJ 3:239-257 discusses seasonal festivals from fall to spring, while TS 17-29 orders them from spring to fall. AJ has no wood offer- ing as in TS 23-25. 3:258-279 As noted above, this section on purity laws is a careful- ly constructed apologia meant to refute anti-Semitic claims about Moses; its form and substance is utterly unlike Ts 46-51. 3:280-286 Josephus, following Lev. 25, describes the sabbatical and jubilee years-topics not found in TS. 4:67-75 Josephus for the most part follows Numbers 18, hav- ing just completed his version of the Korah story. Similar topics appear in TS 15, 21, 35-36, and especial- ly 60 (where the context is Deut. 18:1-8). But Ts 60 treats priestly dues before those of Levites, while Josephus, like Scripture, has the reverse. Moreover, TS has no discussion of levitical cities, which AJ 4:67 draws from Numbers 35. 4:199-213 Most of the laws in AJ-pilgrimages, prostitutes' wages, septennial Torah reading, daily prayers, mezu- zot and tefillin-are not found in TS. AJ 4:207, which admonishes Jews to respect foreign cults, is perhaps the most striking example of apologetic work by Josephus. TS throughout, and especially in 1-2 and 64:9-11, could not be more different from AJ. 4:214-224 Parallels to the four topics treated here in AJ are found in TS 51, 61 and 64, 63 and 56-59, respectively. More- over, AJ 4:223-224 lacks virtually all of the material that TS 56-59 adds to Deut. 17:14-20 regarding laws of monarchy. 4:225-243 As noted above, this collection serves the larger apologetic message of AJ. TS lacks any discussion of boundary markers, and parallels to the rest of the laws here are scattered in TS 46, 52, 60, and 65.</page><page sequence="13">LAWS IN JOSEPHUS AND THE TEMPLE SCROLL 13 4:244-265 Two matters discussed here by Josephus-divorce and levirate marriage-are not found anywhere in TS. The rest of the laws in AJ have parallels in Ts 63-67, though TS, which follows the order of Deut. 21:10-23:1, includes several other subjects. Even where parallel matters are discussed, AJ's logical order-forbidden marriages, virginity suits, two wives, rape, captives, rebellious children, and capital punishment-is utterly unlike Scripture and TS. 4:266-291 Of sixteen topics treated by Josephus, only three have any parallel in TS. 4:292-301 Ts 61:12-63:04, which follows Deut. 20:10-20, is parallel to AJ 4:292-300, but TS treats transvestites in 65:5, with other laws of mixtures. In conclusion, we find little evidence to support Yadin's suggestion that Josephus borrowed from TS to create the legal sections of AJ. Indeed, we would be hard pressed even to suppose that Josephus had Ts before him; if once he had learned this special "Torah" from the Qumran sectaries, he must have forgotten or rejected most of it." For now, two comparable fea- tures of TS and AJ stand out. First, both were fashioned by writers whose self-imposed exile from Jerusalem and the nation of Israel must have weighed heavily on them. Second, both seek to impose the order of subject- classification on God's covenant. But here their similarity ends. The Qumran community created their desert monastery because they rejected the efficacy of the Jerusalem cult and the priest-kings who ruled it. In TS, they promulgated a polemical geography and anthropography of holiness, spatial referents of their conviction that God dwells amidst Israel. For them, Scripture guaranteed that the eternal cult and state of Israel would outlive the temporary disarray of their day.'" Josephus, who had witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the subju- 17. Naturally, Ts and AJ agree in many interesting points of detail. For example, Ts 63:5 says that the elders wash their hands over the head of the heifer of expiation (cf. Deut. 21:6). AJ 4:222 agrees, probably following LXX. Agreements of this sort permit various explanations; taken together they seem insufficient to document Josephus's purported Essene education. 18. Yadin, 1: 296-98. Comparison of this theme in TS with legal and theological positions in other Qumran materials is beyond the scope of this paper. Cf.
