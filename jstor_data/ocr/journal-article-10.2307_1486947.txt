Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990. xi, 152 pp. In her praise of this book quoted on its back cover, Alice L. Laffey remarks, "There are insights in this book that are just brilliant." This reviewer agrees that the book is full of useful insights. Indeed, it seems that the number of useful insights contained in this short volume is greater than one normally finds in a work of biblical scholarship of comparable size.</page><page sequence="2">282 BOOK REVIEWS Jeansonne comments on a number of very interesting aspects regarding the lives of the women in Genesis: "Lot's behavior with his daughters is inexcusable. His treatment of his daughters is not an isolated act but is one of many dubious actions" (p. 42); "Ishmael ... grows up to be 'a bowman,' recalling the description of his imminent death in the desert, when Hagar placed him 'a bowshot away"' (p. 51); "Hagar is the only woman in the Bible to choose a wife for her son" (pp. 51-52); Rebekah "ensures that God's designated choice, Jacob, the second-born, receives Isaac's blessing" (p. 53); Rachel names Bilhah's children, "although the narrator does not consider Bilhah's response" (p. 76); Leah and Rachel are portrayed as women who have different needs, companionship and children respectively (p. 77); Jacob "asks his wife's permission to leave their father's home" (p. 80); "The importance of Rachel and Leah lies not only in their role as the bearers of Jacob's children ... but also as the decision makers who secure the future for their descendants in the promised land" (p. 81); Rachel's theft of the teraphim "is the only occasion in the accounts of the matriarchs where an ancestress in danger provides her own protection" (p. 83); in Gen. 34 "the perspective of the victim [Dinah] is never given" (p. 87); many of the women represented in the Book of Genesis "resort to nonconfrontational methods of dealing with the injustices they experience" (p. 98); "Judah's denial of Shelah to Tamar is a lingering injustice" (p. 106). Many of these points, of course, have been noted before, but by present- ing them in a cumulative manner, Jeansonne sheds new light on the heroines of the narrative. However, it is surprising that she fails to mention the fol- lowing facts about the women of Genesis and their men: While in English common law women could not acquire or hold property, the four matriarchs, like upper-class women throughout the ancient Near East and also in the law of the Talmud, hold property in their own right, including slave women, over which the patriarch have no legal authority. Hence Abram says to Sarai in Gen. 16:6a, "Look,your handmaid is your property [lit., 'in your hand']. Treat her as you see fit." The biblical narrative suggests that matriarchs and other oppressed minorities do not necessarily exert their power more humanely than do patriarchs: "Sarai then abused her so much that she ran away from her" (Gen. 16:6b). This reviewer is disturbed by Jeansonne's finding it surprising that Lot "does not ask either his wife or his daughters to prepare food, in contrast to Abraham's request of his wife to assist" (p. 34). This remark strikes this reviewer as reflecting the sexist assumption that food preparation is</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 283 women's work. In fact, Gen. 19:3 anticipates the contemporary women's movement by its teaching that a man is perfectly capable of preparing a meal without female assistance. Despite Jeansonne's brilliant insights into both the power and the powerlessness of the matriarchs and their handmaids, this reviewer is trou- bled by The Women of Genesis because of its factual errors. These include (1) the assertion that kd'et hayyah (Gen. 18:10, 2 Kings 4:16-17) means "in the spring" (pp. 12, 23);' (2) the assertion that levirate marriage is peculiarly Israelite (p. 101); (3) the assertion that the descendants of Lot and his daughters are continually in strife with the descendants of Abraham and Sarah (p. 32);2 (4) the assertion that "Later Deuteronomic legislation [i.e., Deut. 21:15-17 according to p. 133, n. 11] will prohibit the marriage of sis- ters to the same husband" (p. 75) when, in fact, it is Lev. 18:18 which pro- hibits the marriage of two sisters to the same husband. Deut. 21:15-17, on the other hand, forbids fathers to give the firstborn son's double portion to any child other than the father's firstborn son. No less disturbing are the instances where an inaccuracy found in the text is corrected in the end notes. At p. 85 the author asserts that Leah's death is not mentioned (in the Book of Genesis), a false assertion that is con- tradicted on p. 137, n. 51. Likewise, at p. 87 the author asserts that Dinah is mentioned only in Gen. 34; this false assertion is contradicted on p. 137, n. 2. The misinformation contained in Jeansonne's book means that it can be used by students and nonspecialists only with the greatest of caution. Unfor- tunately, gross errors in a book.of feminist biblical scholarship will encour- age many scholars to dismiss as unworthy of serious consideration both Jeansonne's book in particular and the enterprise of feminist biblical her- meneutics in general. Precisely because feminist biblical scholarship prop- erly executed has the potential of changing for the better the way in which the peoples of the book look upon and treat women, feminist biblical scho- lars must be especially rigorous.
