<plain_text><page sequence="1">A KURDISH JEWISH VARIANT OF THE BALLAD OF "THE BRIDGE OF ARTA" By DONNA SHAI Hebrew University of Jerusalem Reinterpretation is one of the most characteristic qualities of Jewish folklore.' In the process of reinterpretation, "alien" material is adapted and varied to find meaningful expression within the framework of Jewish life and tradition. An example of this process is the ballad "Nemo Delale" in the Zakho Jewish dialect of Neo-Aramaic.2 A variant of the important and well-known ballad narrative associated with the Balkan Peninsula, "The Bridge of Arta," this ballad is known in Greek as "The Bridge of Arta" (Lawson 1910: 263), in Albanian as "Rozafati" (Skendi 1954: 50-55), in Serbian as "Zidanje Skadra" (Skendi 1954: 50-55), in Ru- manian as "Master Manhole or the Building of Arges" (Entwistle 1939: 309), and in Judeo-Spanish as "The Princess and the Bozaji" (Attias 1956: 161-162). Versions have also been collected in Macedonian, Bul- garian, and Hungarian." Hitherto the distribution of the ballad was con- 1. I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Samuel G. Armistead of the University of Pennsylvania, who encouraged me to write this article and directed me to sources of the ballad in the folk literature of the Balkan Peninsula. 2. Jews from Zakho, Kurdistan, speak a dialect of Neo-Aramaic which includes words from Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, Arabic, and Hebrew. Kurmanji (Kurdish) was also spoken by Jews for the purposes of communicating with the Moslem Kurds. 3. For recent research on the ballad in Balkan languages, see G.

The appearance of the ballad as far east as Kurdi- stan, and among the Neo-Aramaic-speaking Jews of Zakho, raises theoreti- cal questions in regard to the diffusion of the ballad to the east, and in regard to the possibility of contact among Jewish groups of this area. The ballad "Nemo Delale" was collected from Kurdish Jews living in Israel who had immigrated from Zakho in 1950-51.4 Although the ballad is sung in Neo-Aramaic, the name "Nemo Delale" is Kurmanji (Kurdish) from the word delal, meaning "dear," "precious," or "pampered." The following text was recorded from Julia Dekel in Jerusalem:6 Nemo came from the haystacks ?flrn ~1f 7 ~ ~2V' ~ 17t~K ,~1t .7 .7 I .7: ~ .7 Nemol cameK from then haystacks r~ 4. Six versions of the ballad "Nemo Delale" and twelve versions of the legend of Nemo Delale were recorded in Neo-Aramaic and Hebrew from former residents of Zakho now living in Israel during fieldwork in the folk literature of the Jews of Zakho in 1971-74. 5. I would like to thank Professor Yona Sabar of the University of California, who indicated the linguistic derivation of the title. 6. This ballad was recorded in Neo-Aramaic from Julia Dekel, formerly of Zakho, tape #17 Shai collection. The ballad was transcribed in Neo-Aramaic by Sara Sabar and translated into English by Professor Yona Sabar and Batia Korach.</page><page sequence="3">DONNA SHAI 305 Arbana, arbana7 Her hands covered with bracelets and gold beads Arbana, delana Say that it is a pity for her that she is separated from boys and girls, grooms and brides. Nemo is coming from the mountain, Truly the stone on her back, how heavy it is! It's truly a pity that she remained alone, separated from friends and com- rades. It's true that Nemo herself says that a voice came from heaven. It's true that when her father heard he sat and cried, heaven and earth shook. Truly, say that the castle in Zakhos is high, high. Say, on the top of it the partridge was crying and truly it's a pity for Nemo that she remained separated from herself. The ballad shows some resemblance to the Greek version of "The Bridge of Arta" (see Sain6an 1902: 362; Lawson 1910: 263; Armistead 1975). In the Greek version the bridge of Arta is built by day but at night it falls in ruins (Motif D 2192), "work of day magically overthrown at night." A spirit from the bridge reveals that a life must be sacrificed to the con- struction in the person of the wife of the master craftsman, who comes at suppertime. The master craftsman sends a message with a nightingale to delay her coming, but the message is reversed and she hurries to the bridge. And now she appears, there she comes, along the white highway. The master craftsman saw her and his heart was breaking. When she descends to recover a lost ring she is buried in the foundations of the bridge. The ballad ends with: Three little sisters were we and all three were ill-fated. One built the Danube bridge; the other, Avlona. The third, the smallest, must build the bridge of Arta. (Armistead 1975) 7. The refrain "Arbana" is a nonsense syllable for keeping the rhythm and is given a different pronunciation by each singer. Texts collected included the refrains: "Horbana," "Arbein," "Delana," "Hai-haya," and "Arvaya haya." 8. The castle referred to here is probably the same described by William Ains- worth, A personal Narrative of the Eufrates Expedition (London: Kegan, Paul, Trench and Co., 1888), p. 327, as the most prominent feature of nineteenth-century Zakho.</page><page sequence="4">306 KURDISH VARIANT OF "THE BRIDGE OF ARTA" In the Kurdish Jewish ballad "Nemo Delale," Nemo is the daughter (sometimes the daughter-in-law) of the master builder and helps to build the bridge of Zakho by carrying the stones on her back. A voice from heaven comes and says that the first human being to step upon the bridge must be sacrificed to the bridge in order that it may stand. When her father sees her approach he is distressed and mourns her, but she is sacri- ficed and the ballad ends with a lament for the death of Nemo Delale. Among Kurdish Jews the ballad is usually sung as a dirge by women following the narration of the legend by the same name, a variant of the international folktale of foundation sacrifice (Motif S 261). (For Kurdish versions, see Beidar 1926, Wilson 1937, MacKenzie 1962, and Shai 1975.) In the Kurdish Jewish version, which differs from the non-Jewish versions, the bridge of Zakho was built in ancient times by a heroine, Nemo (some- times identified as a Philistine), who aids her father-in-law, a master builder, to build the bridge by bringing the stones on her back. As many times as the bridge is constructed, it falls. A supernatural source (a voice from heaven or from a cave) reveals that a life must be sacrificed to the bridge in order that it may be completed. The master builder vows that the first living thing to step onto the bridge will be sacrificed. In some versions Nemo comes dancing and is the first to step on the bridge. In most versions, however, Nemo comes to bring her father-in-law his supper, accompanied by her dog. The dog is to be the sacrifice, but at the critical moment he hesitates, sensing danger, and Nemo is the first to step onto the bridge. She is walled into the foundations of the bridge, but she reaches out her hand and it becomes a tree. After the sacrifice the bridge remains standing. Informants claim to have seen the tree ("Nemo's hand") and a stone where she left the imprint of a foot.9 Among Kurdish Jews the ballad is found exclusively among the Jews from Zakho, although the legend is recited by Kurdish Jews of other locali- ties who learned the legend from Jews of Zakho. The town of Zakho in the north of the Iraqi sector of Kurdistan was, prior to the mass immigration to Israel in the 1950s, the largest and most important Jewish community in Kurdistan. Although a relatively new center (Sabar 1974a: 48), Zakho Jewry followed a traditional way of life, and due to its role as an educational and spiritual center of Judaism, the town was frequently re- ferred to as the "Jerusalem of Kurdistan." Even the simple Jews were familiar with stories from the Bible. Poems, folktales, and epics on biblical figures have been collected from immigrants from Zakho in Israel, 9. From field notes.</page><page sequence="5">DONNA SHAI 307 and familiarity with the Bible is also reflected in the names among men and women, which are mainly those of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs (Sabar 1974a: 43). Both the ballad and the legend of Nemo Delale refer to the bridge at Zakho. Known locally as Geshra Ruah (Neo-Aramaic), "Abassid Bridge," or "Nemo Bridge," it was a frequent site of outings for Jewish residents of the town and an object of curiosity for visitors. The bridge was not only a social center but a center of custom and superstition. Women who were barren would make requests for fertility at the site, and sickly chil- dren were brought there to facilitate a cure. The custom on which the ballad and legend are based, and which is associated with the bridge, is that of "foundation sacrifice." This custom is based on the belief that spirits which inhabit the earth and water are offended by building opera- tions and exact an animal sacrifice for the purposes of propitiation. While this custom is also found internationally, it has deep roots in Jewish tradi- tion (see Trumbull 1896; Brauer 1947; Lauterbach 1951; Armistead 1963; Shai 1973). It is the belief in the efficacy of foundation sacrifice for the successful completion of construction that has been responsible in part for the popularity of the ballad of Nemo Delale among the Jews from Zakho. The text of the ballad narrative shows strong parallels with the biblical story of Jephthah's daughter (Judges 11:30-40), in which Jephthah vows to God that if he is granted viotory in battle he will offer as a burnt offer- ing the first one who comes forth from the door of his house. When he returns home after his victory, his daughter and only child comes out to meet him with timbrels and dancing. He is dismayed, but she tells him that if he has made a vow to the Lord he must carry it out, since he has received the victory for which he asked. She pleads for two months in which to mourn her virginity on the mountains with her companions, and at the end of the two months, Jephthah sacrifices his daughter and fulfills his vow. It is quite possible that, due to the similarities, the story of Jephthah's daughter became grafted onto the original Kurdish Nemo Delale legend. The wording of the ballad is remarkably similar in some sections to the biblical phrasing. For example, in the Neo-Aramaic ballad the father's reaction to the realization that his daughter would be the victim of his vow is: ". .. when her father heard he sat and cried," while the biblical account reads: " . . . when he saw her, . . . he rent his clothes, and said, 'Alas, my daughter.' " Another similarity is in the mountain imagery asso- ciated with Nemo-"Nemo is coming from the mountain"-and with</page><page sequence="6">308 KURDISH VARIANT OF "THE BRIDGE OF ARTA" Jephthah's daughter-" ... she went ... and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains." The image of Jephthah's daughter bewailing her fate is also echoed in the Neo-Aramaic ballad in the stanza, "Truly, say that the castle in Zakho is high, high / Say, on top of it the partridge was crying." The partridge is often used in Kurdish folk songs to represent the virgin or young girl.'0 The ballad shows evidence of influence from the non-Jewish environ- ment as well. Kurdish Jews refer to Nemo Delale as a "great heroine," and the description of the character in the ballad bears resemblance to char- acteristics associated with Moslem female saints. It is a common attribute of female saints that they have superhuman muscular power. The ability to lift stone pillars with one hand is a common motif among Moslem saints (see Canaan 1924: 23). Thus the opening of the ballad, with Nemo approaching, decorated with jewelry, and bearing the huge stone for the construction of the bridge, is similar to the proud posture characteristic of female Moslem saints: Female saints appear mostly as maidens, sometimes as middle-aged women, but very rarely as an old woman.... Saints may be recog- nized on their appearance by a majestic walk, a penetrating eye, a serene look and an erect stature. (Canaan 1924: 5) Another sign of the saint is the leaving of an imprint of hands or feet in a solid rock. This motif appears in the legend of Nemo Delale although not in the ballad. As I have mentioned earlier, the ballad "The Bridge of Arta" was pre- viously considered to exist only in the folk literature of the Balkan Penin- sula, including the Spanish-speaking Jews of Salonika. The appearance of the ballad in a highly developed form as far east as Kurdistan and in a Jewish language raises the question of the possibility of contact and folk literary exchange between the two groups. The ballad "Nemo Delale," as sung by women in Neo-Aramaic, repre- sents a case of the reinterpretation of an international theme. The story of the young girl who is buried alive as a sacrifice for a bridge takes its form from Jewish biblical tradition, while also drawing on international themes and elements from the Moslem Kurdish environment. By recast- ing the characters in the biblical form and by placing them in a local con- text, the bridge at Zakho, the Kurdish Jewish women who sing the ballad give it both a timelessness and an immediacy. 10.
