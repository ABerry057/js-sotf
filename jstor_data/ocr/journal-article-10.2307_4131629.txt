Such works 354</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews differ widely in scope and emphasis. The three recently published volumes under review serve to exemplify such diversity. One examines the movement in its en- tirety, concentrating on the present, primarily from a sociological perspective; the others focus more on history, illuminating in different ways the roles of two of the most influential figures in Conservative Judaism in the past. With the publication of The Conservative Movement in Judaism: Dilemmas and Opportunities, Rela Geffen and the late Daniel Elazar have produced a con- cise yet comprehensive analysis of the Conservative movement's relative strengths and weaknesses. The authors summarize the movement's origins and history, and examine its constituent institutions and organizations. They describe the growth and impact of Havurot, the Ramah Camps and Solomon Schechter Day Schools, and also point out the often articulated shortcomings of Conservatism- problems relating to "turf," ideology, defections (on both the left and the right), and the like. In gathering their data, Elazar and Geffen have surveyed Conservative rab- bis, interviewed a large number of movement leaders, and made use of existing studies on religious observance and affiliation. They identify eight "dimensions" of the movement, for example, demographics, and examine each using the fol- lowing model: 1. A statement of the problem, its dimensions and background; 2. A review of existing data and literature bearing on the problem; 3. The generation of new data as necessary to understand the problem; 4. An outline of plausible policy alternatives to address that problem; 5. A discussion of the merits and potential dangers associated with each pol- icy option; 6. Ideas for additional information gathering, which would further assist the policy-making process (p. 8). But Elazar and Geffen are not content, however, merely to describe the "state of the movement." In Part II of their work, entitled "Next Steps," they offer sug- gestions as to how the Conservative movement should address its problems. Much of their advice, such as broadening the institutional base of the movement to in- clude constituencies beyond congregations, and adopting the name "Masorti" worldwide, is sound; the leaders of Conservatism would be well advised to reflect seriously on this thoughtful volume and to implement many of the authors' rec- ommendations. Louis Finkelstein, who served as president and chancellor of the Jewish The- ological Seminary of America from 1940-1972, was a major figure in shaping Conservative Judaism. Although a good deal has been written about him, Louis Finkelstein and the Conservative Movement: Conflict and Growth is the first book- length treatment. An expanded version of Michael Greenbaum's doctoral disserta- tion, the work is an in-depth study of Finkelstein's first fifteen years in office. Greenbaum is uniquely positioned to author such a volume, having spent his en- tire career at the Seminary, where he currently serves as vice-chancellor and chief administrative officer. Whereas one might assume that his Seminary connection 355</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews might blur Greenbaum's objectivity, happily, such is not the case. He offers a bal- anced, critical analysis of Finkelstein's formative years. Framing his study around the "Mission/Identity Conflict" inherent in all re- ligiously affiliated academic institutions, Greenbaum's initial chapters deal with Finkelstein's predecessors at the Seminary, Solomon Schechter (1902-1915) and Cyrus Adler (1915-1940), for it was their vision that Finkelstein adopted and ex- panded. Each president was firmly committed to the idea that the school's impact be broad and far-reaching, and each was reluctant to define the Seminary narrow- ly as a Conservative institution. This fact was a major source of ongoing tension between Finkelstein and the leaders of the other two arms of the movement, the Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue. Both organizations felt that Finkelstein, in particular, and the Seminary, in general, should primarily serve the movement, whereas Finkelstein was firmly committed to a broader agenda. He be- lieved that the Seminary should serve the entire Jewish, as well as non-Jewish, world; accordingly, he devoted much of his time and energy to creating and ex- panding programs and institutions such as the weekly radio "The Eternal Light," the Jewish Museum, and the Institute for Religious and Social Studies. To his credit, Greenbaum uses many primary sources to document compre- hensively and accurately the positions of both Finkelstein and his critics, and demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses in each. A concluding observation: For this reader, too many financial details vis-a"- vis Seminary campaigns and budgets are included. However, this is understand- able, given the fact that Greenbaum's portfolio includes oversight of the Seminary's finances. Anyone interested in Mordecai Kaplan is familiar with the works of Mel Scult, who has authored and edited a number of books and articles dealing with Kaplan's life and thought. Most recently, Scult has focused on Kaplan's journal and has edited Volume 1, which covers the years 1913-1934. Kaplan, it turns out, was not only an original thinker, prolific author, and pragmatic innovator, but also one of the world's premier diarists. His journal, which begins in 1913 and extends well into the '70s and consists of approximately 10,000 pages occupying 27 volumes, is one of the most extensive personal diaries extant. Scult had unprecedented access to the journal and has judiciously chosen and titled each entry. The selections reflect Kaplan's broad range of interests and activities, and also include candid opinions of the many prominent individuals with whom he interacted. The reader catches glimpses of Kaplan grappling with his evolving theology, struggling with his unappreciative laity and bickering with his intolerant colleagues. The journal does not include much detail about Kaplan's family, but it does offer fascinating insights into his sense of self, apprehensions, self-doubts, and solitude. Sadly, Kaplan had many, many admirers, but few close friends. He con- sidered his journal one, as his poignant entry on July 3, 1929 tells us: "As on pre- vious occasions, I shall resort again to this diary as though it were an intelligent friend... "(p. 341). Scult is to be commended for undertaking the task of making Kaplan's jour- 356</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews nal available to the public. It is riveting and offers unique insights into the mind and thoughts of one of the "giants" of American Judaism. The publication of Vol- ume 2 is anxiously anticipated. Steven M.
