<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham J. Karp, Jewish Continuity in America. Creative Survival in a Free So- ciety. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998. 302 pp. Jewish Continuity in America is a collection of articles written by Abraham Karp over the course of his scholarly career. The earliest essay in the collection was published in 1955 on Jacob Joseph, who was appointed chief rabbi of New York in the late nineteenth century. The most recent previously published essays are an account of Isaac Leeser, traditionalist religious leader and Jewish journal- ist, and an overview of the synagogue in America, both published in 1987. In ad- dition, there are two new essays, one on Congregation Beth Israel of Rochester, New York, and a second on what Karp calls the "tripartite" division of the Ameri- can Jewish community. Because the book is a collection of articles, it could have perhaps been more accurately entitled "Studies in Nineteenth-Century American Jewish History" or "Essays on Rabbis and Synagogues in Nineteenth-Century American Judaism." And yet, a serious effort has been made to place these previously published essays in a broader conceptual framework. Karp has adapted a selection from his book Haven and Home: A History of the Jews in America as an introduction, which is subtitled "Quest for a Viable Identity." The book briefly outlines the European precedents that serve as an important background to the religious changes that oc- curred in nineteenth-century America. Karp discusses how identity as a religious community established a corporate status for the Jewish community in the United States, and suggests that the Jews needed to justify that corporate identity by build- ing a religious ideology, which they found in the Mission Idea. What developed in- volved presenting "a new corporate posture" that was "a dual-image identity." Karp argues that this dual-image identity was "fashioned by the folk wisdom of the people" rather than by rabbis or intellectuals or Jewish communal leaders. This 397</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review identity involved retaining a religious communal self-definition vis-a-vis the larg- er society while maintaining an internal understanding of themselves as a people with their own civilization. Karp divides his studies into three sections. The first deals with the syna- gogue, the second with the rabbinate, and the third with the religious community. The essays are fascinating. The opening chapter deals with the development of dif- ferent types of synagogues in nineteenth- and twentieth-century America. He then describes the development of Congregation Beth Israel of Rochester, New York. Karp lived in Rochester for many years, serving as a Conservative rabbi and as a professor of Jewish studies at the University of Rochester. This essay will be of great value for future researchers writing on the history of the synagogue in America. The second section is the most interesting. Chapters are devoted to Isaac Leeser and Solomon Schechter, as well as to Jacob Joseph and Simon Tuska. Leeser, the most important nineteenth-century traditionalist minister, served for many years at Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia and published the Oc- cident, one of the most widely read Jewish newspapers of its time. The essay on Solomon Schechter, the most important leader of the Conservative Movement in early twentieth-century America, deals primarily with the Genizah scholar's deci- sion to assume leadership of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. But while Schechter was able to build a successful career in the United States, Jacob Joseph of Vilna was destroyed by disunity, infighting, and obtuse lay decisions. When the leaders of Beth Hamidrash Hagadol in New York began to search for a chief rabbi, they faced the daunting task of convincing a major tal- mudic scholar to leave Lithuania to come to the United States. But Jacob Joseph was heavily in debt and saw the monetary inducements offered as the only way he could emerge from his financial crisis. Karp describes the constitutional setup of the association, the arrival of Chief Rabbi Joseph, and even his first sermon. The ensuing conflict and controversies and the eventual failure of the attempt to estab- lish an American chief rabbinate are explained in context. One puzzling aspect of the essay is Karp's insistence on ending this tragic story of the destruction of a scholarly and gentle talmudist on a positive note. He states that the attempt to es- tablish a chief rabbinate "had its lasting effect for the good," arguing that the at- tempt to create a chief rabbinate encouraged H. Pereira Mendes and others to or- ganize the Union of Orthodox Jewish congregations of America in 1898. This reader was not convinced. One of the most interesting essays describes the short rabbinic career of Si- mon Tuska of Rochester and later Memphis. Tuska was the son of the Reverend Mordecai Tuska of the Rochester Jewish community, and he studied at the Uni- versity of Rochester, becoming the first American-born student to travel to Bres- lau to study for the rabbinate. During his years in Europe, he wrote twenty-three letters to Isaac Mayer Wise that were published in the Israelite between 1858 and 1860. Tuska's career was cut short in 1871 when he died of a heart attack at age thirty-six on a Friday night shortly after returning home from services in the Mem- phis temple where he served. Because he died so young, Tuska's story is of inter- est mostly in its description of the life of a young American rabbi. It would be un- fair to compare his accomplishments with those of Leeser or certainly Schechter. 398</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews The final section of the book discusses how the tripartite division of the Amer- ican Jewish religious community developed. Tracing the ideological and institution- al differences back to Europe, Karp explains how the conferences of the antebellum period determined the religious structure of American Jewry. He focuses in on the Cleveland Conference of 1855. But this general chapter is followed by a long essay on the Conservative Movement. While the essay is very good, why are there no par- allel chapters on Orthodoxy and Reform? The postscript deals with Solomon Schindler, the radical Reform rabbi of Temple Israel in Boston, who left Judaism only to return and apologize for the "mistakes I have made" in a guest sermon delivered to his former congregation in March 1911. This, too, is provocative, but does not pro- vide the tying together of the various topics that would have been satisfying. Jewish Continuity inAmerica contains a great deal of thought-provoking ma- terial. Karp writes well and has done extensive research on specific topics, many of which deal in one way or another with Rochester, New York, where he lived and worked for much of his life. He and his publisher have made a serious attempt to take essays that have no organic connection to one another and blend them into a coherent, cohesive volume. Despite the fact that this book cannot be regarded as comprehensive, it nevertheless provides a detailed look at selected aspects of the history of Judaism in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American Judaism. The volume is engaging and will serve as a valuable source of information for re- searchers and as an entertaining read for a general audience.
