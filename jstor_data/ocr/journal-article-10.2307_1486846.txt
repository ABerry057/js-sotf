<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frederic Cople Jaher. A Scapegoat in the New Wilderness: The Origins and Rise of Anti-Semitism in America. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1994. viii, 339 pp. Several years ago, historian Lloyd Gartner noted that American anti- semitism had "yet to receive the thorough study it warrants."' Frederic Cople Jaher meets the challenge and, in great measure, realizes the mandate of Gartner in A Scapegoat in the New Wilderness: The Origins and Rise of Anti-Semitism in America. Don't look for anything particularly "new" or primary here; it was not the author's intention to do manuscript or archival research. Rather, Scapegoat succeeds as a work of synthesis and interpretation, gracefully written and suitable for courses in American Jewish, religious, and social history. It is an encyclopedic survey of secondary sources, printed materials, and edited collections. If you need to enhance your bibliographic knowledge of antisemitism, read Scapegoat, although I found the European listings more complete than the American. For the latter, some books 1. Lloyd P.

Digby Baltzell's The Protestant Estab- lishment (1964), George Marsden's Religion and American Culture (1990), Lawrence Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness (1978), and the very recent This Happy Land by James W. Hagy (1993). Scapegoat is thematically strong, even if the discussions surrounding the European provenance and progress of antisemitism sometimes overwhelm the American core of the tale. In five chapters and an epilogue, Jaher sweeps us forward from antiquity through antebellum America. When occasion permits, he is not loath to make comparisons to the modem period, some of which are more apt than others. For example, he should offer some sort of caveat to readers for what might be overconfident analogies between fifteenth- and twentieth-century occurrences, as in "the persecution of Iberian New Christians . . . anticipated the search for Jewish forebears by the Nazis and the Gestapo's refusal to distinguish between converts and those remaining Jewish" (p. 75). Though occasional juxtaposition of events such as these may be a bit jarring, the general framework is compelling: that a continuity of antisemitic thought persists in history, is currently operative, and is frighteningly resilient; also, European antecedents are important for understanding antisemitic developments in the North American colonies and later in the United States. Of all the factors that mingle in historic antisemitism--economic, social, national, cultural--Jaher feels that religion is primary: "None of the others ... gave birth to Christianity, killed its God and was assigned by Christian doctrine a pivotal role in the cosmic struggle between the saved and the damned" (p. 16). Hellenized, pagan thought percolated through the volatile Roman world too with crucial but opposite impact on Judaism and Christianity; what were minor currents in the former became major in the latter. A pre-Christian perception of Hebrews, Israelites, and Judeans as misanthropic, odd, or eccentric was institutionalized as Jew-hatred within the context of the Gospels, the emerging Western Church, and its symbols. Historical apologists for Christianity, such as J. M. Oesterreicher, T. Idinopulos, and R. B. Ward, are dismissed by the author, who points out that, over the course of fifteen hundred years, Jews were removed from Christian presence, satanized, diabolized, demonized, and periodically charged with deicide, host desecration, blood libel, sorcery, and degeneracy. Why weren't the Jews simply extirpated? Apparently, this is Christianity's perpetual ambivalence or dichotomy of feeling toward Jews which evolved into a universal phenomenon: Christians</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 451 love Judaism, at least the parts they have adapted, but not Jews, a remnant of whom have to be preserved to witness the second coming. Such psychic tension had to find release and sometimes did creatively but most often destructively-from social discrimination to murderous rages. Jaher's remaining chapters describe the range of social and business discrimination, educational, political, and cultural stereotyping extant in America until 1865. Some interesting names appear as inheritors of a Conti- nental Jew-hating tradition: Jonathan Edwards, John Quincy Adams, James Fenimore Cooper, Benjamin Rush, Charles Grandison Finney, William Lloyd Garrison, William McGuffey, William Ellery Channing, Walt Whitman, Julia Ward Howe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Herman Melville, the Federalist Party generally, but not Washington, Hamilton, or Adams par- ticularly, and, to a lesser degree, that party's collateral descendant the Whigs, although Judah Benjamin was one of its southern bulwarks. Oddly enough, or not so oddly because of their "popular" appeal and pretense, Republicans and, later, Democrats attracted a Jewish membership despite Jefferson's ethnic ambivalence and a leadership representation of pro-slaveryites within Jackson's party. On the whole, however, negative feelings for Jews, no matter how verbally unattractive, were sublimated, channeled, and mitigated by a failure to give them credence within the legal, constitutional system. One minor carp I have with Scapegoat which I have already alluded to is that European themes, either intentionally or incidentally, are sharper and more clearly delineated than the American. For an American history monograph-after all, the title emphasizes the New Wilderness-this might require some scholarly rethinking. It is perfectly legitimate to write of the French Revolution, European Romance, Charles Fourier, and Karl Marx, but not at the expense of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which are barely recorded, the three financial panics between 1819 and 1857, the Second Great Awakening, and Manifest Destiny, all of which were ongoing American events heightening civil discord, leading to national disunity, and precipitating episodes of domestic antisemitism, but are entirely omitted. Some imbalance notwithstanding, Scapegoat is an interesting and vital inclusion to a growing bibliography on a most important topic. Stuart E.
