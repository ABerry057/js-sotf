<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 29:1 (2005), 91-110 CULTIVATING ROOTS: THE PROMOTION OF EXILARCHAL TIES TO DAVID IN THE MIDDLE AGES by Arnold Franklin Jewish sources emanating from the Islamic world of the Middle Ages abound in references to individuals bearing the title nasi' ("prince"; plural, nesi'im). In the unique religious and cultural world of the medieval Near East this biblical desig- nation signified, with rare exception, descent from King David through the line of the Babylonian exilarchs. While at one time the title was restricted to incumbents of the exilarchate, by the eleventh century CE it had been appropriated by a broad- er circle of individuals who claimed descent from David but were often only dis- tantly related to occupants of that office.1 These nesi'im enjoyed a measure of sta- tus in the Jewish communities of the Near East that was informed by the importance of noble ancestry in Arabic society in general and Islamic veneration for King David in particular. The impact that conceptions derived from Islamic culture had on Jewish thinking about Davidic ancestry in this period can be observed most clearly in the greetings included in a letter sent either by a relative or a close associate of the nasi' Solomon ben Jesse, circa December 1236.2 The missive addresses Solomon as "the sayyid (chief) of the Davidic faction, and the sharif (noble one) of the Jew- 1.

In certain cases Muslim governmental authorities reinforced the status of the nesi'im by granting them official recognition. A Mamluk-era letter of appointment for the office of head of the Jews in Egypt contains a clause in which the appointee is charged, inter alia, with protecting the privileges of those "who have a kinship relationship (luhmat nasab) to David, peace be upon him, and possess through him the nobility of lineage (hurmat nasab)."4 Nesi 'im and exilarchs actively sought to cultivate popular belief in their Da- vidic ancestry. They reinforced this idea through a variety of publicly oriented strategies, among which we may enumerate the recording of elaborate genealogies, a preference for Davidic names, and the use of symbols with a popularly under- stood Davidic significance. An ancient tradition preserved in rabbinic literature as- sociates the family of the exilarchs with the Davidic line, but the connection be- came far more pronounced in the centuries after the advent of Islamic rule and the Arabization of the Near East. Indeed, the very expansion of the title nasi' in the Middle Ages to include non-office-holding members of the exilarchal family at- tests to a rethinking of the significance of exilarchal status along lines that began to privilege the dynastic component over the political. In what follows, the me- dieval emphasis on the Davidic ancestry of exilarchs and nesi'im will be explored along with the various ways in which it was given public expression. This analy- sis suggests that perceptions of one of the most important institutions in medieval Jewish history evolved during the Islamic period, adapting to a vocabulary of au- thority characteristic of the surrounding Islamic society. Rabbinic texts predating the Islamic era attest to an established belief that the exilarchs were descendants of King David.5 According to a ruling of Rabbi Yose ben Bun, an exilarch called to read from the Torah is not obliged to go over to it, but is instead handed the scroll while seated "because David's seed is infused in him, and he is treated according to the custom of his ancestors."6 A statement 3.

Sotah 7:6. 92</page><page sequence="3">Cultivating Roots attributed to the Babylonian amora Samuel also appears to accept that view when it urges Mar cUqba the exilarch to "execute judgment in the morning," echoing words the prophet Jeremiah used to chastise the biblical House of David.7 Other passages confirm the widespread dissemination of that ancestral tradition even as they call its legitimacy into question. One such passage relates a comment made by the sons of Rabbi Hiyya while they were sitting at the table of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. Cleverly playing on a number of stylistically similar statements, they pro- claim that "the Son of David (i.e., the Messiah) will arrive only after the disap- pearance of the two ruling houses in Israel, the exilarchate in Babylonia and the partiarchate in the Land of Israel."g If the Davidic descent of the exilarchs was firmly established before the sev- enth century, the Islamic period witnessed an intensification and broadening of that ancestral claim as well as a new and profound concern with its demonstrabil- ity.9 The most explicit evidence of this shift can be observed in the numerous ge- nealogies that begin to appear in the tenth century, which trace the ancestry of members of the exilarchal family back to King David in as many as 60 and 70 gen- erations. The first such genealogical list directly linking the Babylonian exilarchs with the Davidic kings appears in the medieval chronograph Seder 'olam zuta, compiled in the late eighth or early ninth century.'0 The first part of the text enu- 7. See B. Shabbat 55a, with reference to Jeremiah 21:12. 8. B. Sanhedrin 38a. Compare similar statements in B. Sanhedrin 98a, each of which begins with the formulaic phrase "The Son of David will arrive only after ... ." Rabbi .Hayya's sons' comment is an ironic inversion of these that not only accuses the exilarchate and the patriarchate of corruption, but also implicitly rejects whatever messianic claims may have been associated with those offices. For evidence of messianic hopes pinned on Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, see Moshe Aberbach, ".Hizkiyahu melekh Yehudah ve-rabi Yehudah ha-nasi': heksherim meshihiyim," Tarbiz 53 (1984): 353-71. 9. I am positing a distinction between the vague assertions of descent found in rabbinic litera- ture and the more precise genealogies that were produced in the Middle Ages. This point is also noted in Abraham Ibn Daud, The Book of Tradition (Sefer ha-Qabbalah) by Abraham Ibn Daud, ed. and trans. Gerson Cohen (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1967), 51. For a similar distinc- tion between the vague genealogical claims of Iranians and the more precise genealogies produced by Arabs in the early Islamic period, see Roy Mottahedeh, "The Shu'~ibfyah and the Social History of Ear- ly Islamic Iran," International Journal of Middle East Studies 7 (1976): 172-74. 10.

There is little consensus regarding the prove- nance of this text or the agenda of its editor(s). A critical edition of this short, but extremely important text is a major desideratum, as is a fresh evaluation of its contents and agenda. In particular, attention should be given to the tension between what has commonly been seen as the work's generally pro- exilarchal posture on the one hand, and elements of the story of Mar Zutra, which appears near its con- clusion, on the other. In its extant form the latter story is explicitly concerned with chronicling the de- cline of the Davidic family, and begins "In those days an end came to the House of David." On this point see Hanokh Albeck's observation in Leopold Zunz, Ha-Derashot be-Yisra'el ve-hishtalshelutan ha-historit, ed. and trans. Hanokh Albeck (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1974), 308.

Saul Rabbinowitz (Warsaw, 1890-1902), 3:387, according to which Seder 'olam zuta seeks to deny the existence of legitimate heirs to the Davidic line in Babylonia. The 93</page><page sequence="4">Arnold Franklin merates the generations from Adam to Jehoiachin, the last king of Judah, exiled to Babylonia before the destruction of Jerusalem in the sixth century BCE. The next part of the work gives the names of Jehoiachin's descendants in Babylonia along with names of their rabbinic contemporaries. The list begins with Jehoiachin's son Shealtiel, and continues down to Mar Zutra, the son of Mar Zutra the exilarch, who, according to the chronicle, left Babylonia and settled in Palestine. The most in- ventive section connects the biblical Zerubbabel, active during the Persian period and here identified as the son of Shealtiel, with Huna, an exilarch known inde- pendently from rabbinic sources. This abbreviated segment, which purports to cov- er a period of over five hundred years, is a reworking of the list of Zerubbabel's relatives and offspring as given in 1 Chronicles 3 interspersed with the names of exilarchs appearing in rabbinic literature." It is thus a highly imaginative geneal- ogy designed to bridge the gap between the biblical and post-biblical Davidic lines, and, in the judgment of many modern scholars, an attempt to prove that the Baby- lonian exilarchs were the rightful heirs to the biblical House of David. The ge- nealogy it sets forth thus served to bolster the legitimacy of the exilarchate by pro- viding it with a demonstrable Davidic pedigree. The genealogy of the exilarchal dynasty presented in Seder 'olam zuta was widely accepted during the Middle Ages, and was reproduced in the personal lin- eages of numerous members of the Davidic family.'2 Scholars have argued that the exilarchate satisfied a psychological need for medieval Jews, at once reminding them of a glorious past and promising them a future redemption in the messianic era. 3 The same may be said for exilarchal genealogies, which reified for medieval Jews the attenuated lines that connected them with the biblical past. To be sure, ex- ilarchal genealogies were, first and foremost, credentials for those who possessed them, validating their claim to membership in the Davidic family. Indeed, we will have occasion below to observe a number of instances in which medieval Davidic genealogies functioned in precisely this fashion. But on a broader plane, they also attended to a society-wide preoccupation with explicitly charting the continuities between medieval Jewish society and antiquity. As such, they should be viewed as responses to a challenge not altogether different from the one that inspired me- dieval "chain of tradition" works. These works sought to refute Christian, Islamic and Karaite challenges to the historical validity of medieval rabbinic Judaism by establishing, in elaborate detail, that the latter was heir to an unbroken and au- thentic tradition, originating in the Bible and continuing through the rabbis of the Talmud and their successors. In similar fashion, exilarchal genealogies, which pro- Mar Zutra story is clearly set off from the rest of the chronicle by its use of Aramaic and its narrative form. According to Rabbinowitz and Moshe Gil ("Ha-mifgash ha-bavli," Tarbiz 48 [1978-79]: 45) the story of Mar Zutra is indebted to an earlier story about the exilarch Bustanai, referenced later in this article. 11.

Thus even those with no personal stake in their claims understandably found exilarchal genealogies to be objects of tremen- dous interest. Genealogical texts captured the attention of medieval authors as diverse as Jewish biblical commentators and travel writers. That they did reveals both how important and widespread they were in medieval society.14 The Andalusian exegete Abraham Ibn Ezra (d. 1164) is reminded of the genealogical records kept by the exilarchate in his commentary on Zechariah 12:7, which refers to the "the glory of the House of David." Ibn Ezra notes that "the House of David lives in Baghdad to this very day, a great and large family possessing a family tree (sefer ha-yahas) go- ing back to antiquity." The genealogical records of members of the Davidic family are also men- tioned frequently in the accounts of Jewish travelers, who considered them among the more notable treasures in the possession of the communities they visited. The late-twelfth-century travelers Benjamin of Tudela and Petahyah of Regensburg took interest in the genealogical records of the exilarchs and nesi'im they encoun- tered while visiting the Near East."1 Moses ben Samuel, a Karaite from Damas- cus, mentions meeting a nasi' named Sar Shalom in Cairo whose lineage "goes back to the tribe of Judah."16 And a century and a half later, another traveler, the famous Mishnah exegete Obadiah ben Abraham of Bertinoro (d. ca. 1509), learned of the existence of a Davidic genealogy in Cairo while visiting that city. In a letter to his father written in 1488 he reports: They told me of one of the Karaites in Cairo, named Zedakah, a wealthy and upright man, who was certainly related to King David. And they bid him to show me the genealogy (sefer ha-yahas), signed by witnesses in every gener- ation. But I did not see it because of the constraints of time."7 In similar fashion, Isaac Akrish (b. 1530) mentions viewing a Davidic pedigree in Damascus that had been passed down from father to son for ten generations.'8 For medieval Jews these genealogical records possessed a relic-like importance that simultaneously derived from and reinforced the special significance associated with membership in the Davidic family.

In his biographical dictionary, Ibn al- Fuwati mentions that while in the city of Tabriz he made a copy of the genealogy of Ddn-iyl ibn Dawild, a pedi- gree "that extends back to David, the son of Jesse, without interruption."19 While there Ibn al-Fuwati also transcribed the ancestor list of Harfin ibnYiisuf ibn Diniyild al-Dawfidi, which also continued back to David and was "more complete (mut- tasil)" than any other he had seen among the Jews.20 Davidic genealogies were not only objects of popular fascination, however; they could also be used to legitimate political power. A letter from the Cairo Ge- niza that has been dated to the first half of the eleventh century describes the ex- ploits of an individual who appeared in a town in northern Palestine and attempt- ed to pass himself off as a nasi'.21 According to the letter's author, the unnamed impostor presented the townspeople with a fraudulent genealogical record in or- der to substantiate his claim to noble status. Excited about the prospects of wel- coming a scion of the Davidic family into their midst, the residents of the town ap- parently took him at his word and entrusted him with wide-ranging communal authority until his deception came to light some two years later. The letter writer reports: Our brothers, certainly you are aware of the terrible things that befell our com- munity and yours, Egypt, Jerusalem and all of the Land Israel, at the hands of that man called nasi', who acquired for himself a good reputation and had in his possession a genealogy. He passed judgments, caused vexations, desig- nated assistants, appointed deputies, wrote letters, dispatched runners, col- lected taxes and went from place to place judging Israel. All the while you pos- sessed in your land a Sanhedrin with haverim, scholars, and students who were more valiant in Torah than all others; yet they submitted to his authority and treated him with honor and respect, failing to check his lineage properly. They imbibed his words with thirst, praised him, eulogized him before the nations and extolled him in front of kings and princes everywhere he went, from Egypt to Kalneh. Neither scholar nor rosh nor student hindered him; his bans were upheld and his rulings were registered before all. But after two years it came to light that he was not a nasi' and that the communities had failed to recog- nize that the lineage he claimed was untrue, yet they still remained unabashed in their respect for him, insisting that he was a scholar.22 While Davidic genealogies did not automatically translate into political power for their bearers, this incident illustrates how considerably they could support claims to authority in a society so heavily invested in the symbolic meaning of the Da- vidic family. 19.

Ibid, 39, lines 42-54. 96</page><page sequence="7">Cultivating Roots The special status accorded to members of the Davidic family depended in part on the individual's ability to prove and display his ancestry publicly. The au- thor of the letter discussed above complains that no one bothered to inspect the self-styled nasi"s lineage, implying that had they done so they would have surely discerned his true identity and thus spared themselves his manipulations. We have already noted various situations in which the genealogical records of nesi'im and exilarchs were viewed privately by curious individuals. In other settings the ge- nealogies of nesi'im and exilarchs were publicly viewed. A poetic composition written in honor of the fourteenth-century Iraqi exi- larch Sar Shalom ben Pinhas illustrates the public use of genealogies as a mecha- nism for legitimating authority.23 The poem refers to Sar Shalom's appointment to a position of power-quite possibly the office of exilarch-and compares him to a newly crowned king: "Behold Sar Shalom our nasi' ... a king who ascended the steps of dignity." Several lines later Sar Shalom's ancestry is introduced as a cause for joy and a mark of his nobility: "Be merry, Adina (i.e., Baghdad), and rejoice in him; sing unto God with drums and cymbals! For one related to the lord (gevir, i.e., David) has been crowned, the beloved of comely appearance and beautiful eyes."24 Several damaged lines referring to Sar Shalom's pedigree accompany the poem and describe the occasion for its composition: ". .. his name is Sar Shalom ... the son of... Pinhas .... Their genealogy attests that they are descendants of Solomon and David, and just as the veracity of their genealogy was confirmed be- fore the assembled congregation, so was it verified before the writer whose name appears at the end of these lines ... "25 It is difficult to determine the precise circumstances alluded to in this com- posite text. Mann's suggestion that the poem and the accompanying lines refer to a ceremony in which the Baghdad community confirmed Sar Shalom's right to use the title "nasi"' is problematic, as there is no indication that nesi'im ever sought or obtained such authorization.26 If, as seems likely, the Sar Shalom mentioned in the text is identical with the exilarch of the same name, it may be surmised that the coronation ceremony is connected with Sar Shalom's appointment to the office of exilarch. Regardless of the precise circumstances, however, a number of general observations can be made. First, the text envisions a public ceremony in which Sar Shalom's genealogy was rehearsed and admired. The text also raises the issue of verification; genealogies, as we have seen, could be falsified, and the public dis- play of a "true" genealogy is treated here as an occasion for celebration. Finally, the text offers insight into the overall purpose of exilarchal genealogies, namely, to prove that one is a descendant of King David. Much more than family heirlooms, Davidic genealogies served as credentials that played a significant role in shaping 23. See the text, TS 13J25.21, in Mann, Jews in Egypt, 2:207-208. 24.

Ibid, 1:174. 97</page><page sequence="8">Arnold Franklin public perceptions of nesi'im and exilarchs as members of a vibrant and flourish- ing House of David. Memorial services for deceased relatives were the most common public set- ting in which genealogies were recited. Many ancestor lists, hastily compiled for such occasions by synagogue readers, have been preserved in the Geniza and con- stitute a greatly underutilized source for exploring societal attitudes towards the family.27 Though most lists include only a few generations of ancestors, they nev- erless reveal a desire to locate those being memorialized in relation to a signifi- cant forebear, in some cases who is also a biblical figure. Thus, individuals from the family of the priestly ge'onim who controlled the Palestinian yeshivah during the eleventh century were memorialized as members of the "House of the Priest," that is, the dynasty of the biblical Aaron.28 In similar fashion, a Karaite memorial list begins with a commemoration of deceased nesi'im designated as "the noble family (ha-mishpahah ha-meyuhasah), the family of the House of David."'29 The regular attendee of the synagogue, the primary arena for communal gatherings in which societal values were enacted, was thus presented with a view of Jewish so- ciety structured around kinship groups that descended from and were defined by ancestral figures. In the case of nesi'im and other elite groups, social prestige was thus manifested and legitimated through the regular rehearsal of an ennobling bib- lical lineage. Davidic genealogies were not only recorded in ancestor and memorial lists; they were also incorporated into verse compositions intended to flatter a nasi' pa- tron or friend. The poet who produced such a panegyric, however, was not obliged to review his recipient's entire genealogy; instead, he might recall fifteen or six- teen of his ancestors, giving greater weight to the forebears and descendants of King David mentioned in the Bible. Yet in explicitly mentioning even so many an- cestors, these abbreviated genealogies were clearly informed by prevailing cultur- al attitudes that elicited the production of much longer and more complete lists. The celebration of distinguished ancestry forms the central theme of a 243- line poem dedicated to the nasi' Daniel ben 'Azaryah (d. 1062), who assumed the headship of the Palestinian yeshivah in 1052.30 The poem, composed in 1057 by 'Eli ha-Kohen, utilizes Daniel ben 'Azaryah's descent from King David in order to situate him within the epic sweep of Israel's sacred history. The poem's first one hundred lines closely imitate the introduction to a classical Cavodah, a genre of liturgical poetry that describes the sacrificial rite for the Day of Atonement, re- viewing biblical history down to the appointment of Aaron and his offspring to the high priesthood. After a lengthy introduction, cEli ha-Kohen's poem describes the creation of the universe (lines 56-64), the lives of the patriarchs (lines 64-78), the 27. See the preliminary observations in S.D.

Like an 'avodah, the poem then focuses on the tribe of Levi (lines 101- 04) and the selection of Aaron, who is "exalted above his fellows in love, who atones for sins and causes them to vanish" (lines 105-09). But while an avodah would then proceed to describe the Temple rite per- formed by Aaron's descendants on the Day of Atonement, 'Eli ha-Kohen's poem abruptly drops Levi and focuses on another of the Israelite tribes. The poem an- nounces that "the fourth (of Jacob's sons) was victorious in his deeds, a leader and commander by destiny." What then follow are forty lines of praise for the tribe of Judah, opening with an enumeration of Judah's descendants and concluding with four stanzas of panegyrics for the most famous of his offspring, King David (lines 110-45). The poem then briefly mentions eight of David's righteous biblical suc- cessors, culminating with "Zerubbabel the exilarch" (lines 146-53). Considerably accelerating its review of the Davidic line, the poem next mentions the much fa- bled exilarch Bustanai and then proceeds to its true hero and the subject of the re- mainder of the composition, Daniel ben 'Azaryah himself. His ancestral worthi- ness amply demonstrated, Daniel's other attributes are admired. He is compared to the sun in his righteousness, extolled for his learning, and praised for eradicating impiety and condemning immoral behavior. With the exception of the exodus from Egypt and the revelation at Mount Sinai, sacred time is recounted in the poem not according to moments of national historical significance, but through a succession of divinely chosen ancestors. And lying at the very heart of this vision of the Jewish past, tinged with messianic over- tones, is the Davidic family. In addition to structuring the panegyric, the recitation of Daniel's genealogy has overt political significance. In portraying Daniel ben 'Azaryah as the direct successor to a continuous line of descendants of King David, the poem dramatically suggests that his assumption of the post of ga'on be viewed as part of a divine plan extending back to creation itself. Not everyone, however, saw things in precisely this manner. Daniel ben CAzaryah's appointment as ga'on of the Palestinian yeshivah was, in fact, fraught with controversy, for it entailed an unusual departure from the customary system of progression within the ranks of the institution, as well as the displacement of a candidate from a family of priests long associated with the leadership of the yeshiv- ah. 'Eli ha-Kohen's composition, with its heavy emphasis on the chosen nature of the Davidic family (and, by implication, its superiority to Aaron's priestly dynasty), was part of a broad campaign aimed at rescuing the gaonate of Daniel ben 'Azaryah from its disputed status. Though preserved for posterity in written form, this work, like most medieval panegyrics, was originally intended for oral performance.31 The public celebration and rehearsal of genealogy, albeit in abbreviated form, thus assumed a critical role in clarifying Daniel ben cAzaryah's public identity as a member of the Davidic family. A similar use of a genealogy can be found in Sefer tahkemoni, the collection of Hebrew prose-poems by the medieval Spanish poet Judah al-Harizi (1170- 1235). In a long encomium to Josiah ben Jesse, a nasi' in Damascus, al-Harizi 31. Fleischer, "Kavim hadashim," 57. 99</page><page sequence="10">Arnold Franklin makes much of his subject's ancestry, variously describing him as "the offspring of kings" and as "one who merited a noble lineage and a good reputation." On a more profound level al-Harizi draws attention to his subject's lineage by weaving scriptural verses connected with the Davidic family into his panegyric, creating the imaginative impression that their fulfillment is to be found in Josiah. But al-Harizi does not limit himself to indirect allusions to Josiah's ancestry; he also reproduces an abbreviated genealogy tracing the nasi"s connection to King David in sixteen generations.32 The notion that the recitation of one's noble ancestors constituted a form of praise is reflected as well in the elaborate introduction to a letter addressed to Daniel ben cAzaryah's son, David (d. 1094). Like his father, David posed a threat to the usurped descendants of the Palestinian ga'on Solomon ha-Kohen ben Joseph (d. 1025), though this challenge came not by way of an appointment to a post with- in the yeshivah, as in Daniel's case, but through David's activities in Egypt. Ulti- mately David ben Daniel's arrogation of such prerogatives as maintaining a high court, appointing local officials and collecting taxes-privileges normally associ- ated with the geonic yeshivot-laid the groundwork for Egyptian Jewry's political autonomy from the Palestinian yeshivah. Despite the very different trajectory his career took from that of his father, David, like Daniel, found both opportunity and legitimacy in his Davidic ancestry, audaciously proclaiming himself exilarch in or about the year 1091.33 After learning of this, a loyal supporter living in Tyre wrote to the newly de- clared exilarch to convey his congratulations. His mood was ecstatic: "When your servant learned that you attained the prestigious rank of your ancestors, having been designated exilarch and crowned with rule, I prostrated myself and gave thanks to God for your success in being brought into His assembly and adorned with the mantle of your forebears." The letter includes an alphabetic acrostic com- prising a series of alliterative epithets for David that cleverly enumerate his bibli- cal progenitors. To give only a few examples, he is hailed "the descendant of Boaz (ben beri Bodaz)," "the banner of David (degel David)," "the seed of Zerubabbel (zera' Zerubavel)," and "the offspring of Hezekiah (hanit Hizkiyah)." As in the poem for his father, the list of David's progenitors is abbreviated, yet it still reviews individually no fewer than sixteen generations. Genealogies were thus not mere curiosities; they were objects of fascination for medieval Jews in part because they were understood to be a complement to and a verification of the historical continuity embodied by members of the Davidic family. Such notions were nourished by the highly public use to which genealogies might be put as nesi'im and exilarchs sought to locate themselves within a network of respect for the Davidic family. Yet, as we have already noted, such public dis- plays of one's ancestry also entailed a certain amount of exposure. As credentials, genealogies could be forged by individuals who sought to capitalize on the wide- 32. Tahkemoni, ed. Y. Toporovsky (Tel Aviv, 1952), 24ff. 33.

The Babylonian nesi'im issued a ruling supporting Samuel and insisting that he be permitted to return to Strasbourg and compensated for his suf- fering and financial losses. In affixing their names to the harshly worded text both nesi'im provide elaborate genealogies that contribute to the gravity of the ban. David ben Hodayah traces himself back to King David through Judah ha-Nasi and Hillel the Elder, while Yedidyah ben Jesse lists ancestors going back through the familiar exilarchal line. After the genealogies we find the following warning: "Out of fear of forgery we hereby decree a ban, an excommunication and a curse upon anyone who copies this lineage, written with (all of) its links ... and the (scribe) who has copied our letter has heeded our decree and omitted one name from each of the genealogies."35 The importance of Davidic ancestry as a means of attaining social prestige is also reflected, albeit negatively, in a version of the story of the exilarch Bustanai discovered in the Cairo Geniza. The text, which can be read as a reaction against the widespread privileging of descent from King David, was copied in 1041, and may have been distributed in order to bolster Nathan ben Abraham's claim to lead- ership of the Palestinian yeshivah. Unlike other stories about Bustanai that circu- lated in the Middle Ages, the Judeo-Arabic version is a satire intended to under- mine the social status associated with Davidic ancestry.36 The story, which is set in the first half of the seventh century, describes how Bustanai and another man, each seeking appointment as exilarch, came before the caliph 'Umar ibn al-Khatt~b. As Bustanai, the last living member of the Davidic line, argued his case, a mosquito bit him, causing his face to bleed. Out of respect for the Muslim sovereign Bustanai did not flinch, very much impressing cUmar, who decided in his favor, appointed him exilarch, and gave him as a gift the daugh- ter of the recently captured Persian emperor. In commemoration of this auspicious incident, the text explains, the family of David engraved the image of a mosquito on its seal. Bustanai bore children with his Persian concubine but "either out of igno- rance or baseness" did not free her beforehand. His offspring therefore had the sta- tus of slaves. The text points out that, with the possible exception of certain indi- viduals in faraway lands known as benei marvata ("men of authority"), no one from the Davidic dynasty is free of this genealogical blemish because Bustanai was 34.

The story concludes by affirming belief in the Da- vidic Messiah, "the anticipated one (al-muntazar)." Born on the very day the Tem- ple was destroyed, he alone is "free of this taint and will come from the pure line, unsullied by contamination." 37 This story represents a direct challenge to the ancestral claims of the exilar- chal dynasty, portraying their widely respected lineage as cause for embarrass- ment. The centrality of ancestry is apparent from the text's opening line, which in- troduces the story that follows as "the genealogy of the Davidic family (nasab al-d'nwiidiya)." This theme resurfaces at the end of the story when the text reflects on the meaning of the events described and concludes that, aside from the far-off benei marvata, "no one from the line of David remains unaffected by this inci- dent." If members of the exilarchal family sought to promote themselves through noble lineage, this version of the story of Bustanai squarely challenged their claim by insisting that the Davidic line was in fact irreparably marred by the shameful behavior of one of its ancestors. This line of argument is, however, delicately bal- anced with the normative belief in a Messiah descended from King David in the text's conclusion. Invoking a rabbinic tradition according to which the Messiah was born on the very day that the Jerusalem temple was destroyed, the text succeeds in upholding the traditional notion of a Davidic Messiah even as it impugns the le- gitimacy of all contemporary claimants to the Davidic legacy. The propagation of Davidic genealogies is only the most explicit illustration of the way members of the medieval House of David laid claim to an historical, and primarily biblical, legacy. Further evidence of this process can be seen in their preference for the names of biblical figures associated with the Davidic family. Ex- amining the onomastic customs of the Geniza society generally, Goitein conclud- ed that family cohesiveness and veneration for previous generations guided the de- cision to name male children after their forebears.38 The extent to which naming practices were bound up with the process of identity formation is particularly ap- parent in the case of members of the Davidic family, for whom personal names served as an additional means of fostering the common belief in their ancestral connection to King David. Between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries families of nesi'im and exi- larchs exhibited a strong predilection for biblical names associated with the Da- vidic dynasty.39 For illustration we may point to the ancestries of three descendants of the late-ninth-century exilarch Zakkai: 1) the eleventh-century nasi' David ben 37. For a consideration of the specific context in which the story was copied, see Gil, "Ha-mif- gash ha-bavli," 39-41. For an entirely different valuation of Bustanai, one that celebrates him as a no- ble ancestor, see the poem, discussed above, in honor of Daniel ben 'Azaryah (Fleischer, "Kavim hadashim," 70), in which the nasi' and ga'on is enthusiastically described as "a spark of Bustanai." 38. See Goitein, Mediterranean Society, 3:6-8. On the significance of women's names, see ibid., 313-19. 39. Both Mann and Goitein noted the recurrence of Davidic names in the ancestor lists of Karaite nesi'im. See Mann, Jews in Egypt, 2:215; Goitein, Mediterranean Society, 3:427 n. 32.

Recognition of the power of names to shape an individual's public image can be found in the so-called "Scroll of Zuta," Abraham ben Hillel's account of the downfall of a corrupt Egyptian Jewish leader composed in 1197.43 The scroll's evil protagonist, identified simply as Zuta ("the little one"), sought popular support by appealing to the messianic expectations of the Jewish population and proclaimed himself the herald of the Messiah: "Comfort, o comfort, my people, for the light of salvation will come forth in my lifetime, and from me you will receive the Mes- siah."44 Significantly, Zuta's posturing involved the adoption of a new name, one better suited to his aspirations and with deep messianic resonance. According to the scroll, "his parents called him Yahya, but he changed his name to Sar Shalom." Abraham ben Hillel gives voice to widely held attitudes about the ability of names to express both personal ambition and ancestral entitlement when he has Zuta fur- ther declare: "Is not authority (misrah, on the basis of Isaiah 9:5) firmly set in my name-my inheritance from father and mother?"45 Given a cultural environment in which Jewish and Muslim rulers expressed their religious and political ideologies through carefully chosen titles, the impor- 40.

Their discernible pref- erence for Davidic names reinforced popular perceptions that they were indeed scions of a living House of David. If the conferral of personal names by family members reflects an attempt to construct a particular social identity, titles, i.e., the designations used by others when referring to nesi'im and exilarchs, indicate the degree to which that identity was publicly affirmed. Widespread use of the Arabic term al-dadwidi ("the de- scendant of David") in place of the Hebrew term nasi' suggests that the exilarchal family's attempts to shape an identity oriented towards the biblical monarch large- ly coincided with popular sentiments. Al-ddw4idf is in the form of an Arabic nisba, or noun of relation, establishing a connection between a subject and, in this case, an ancestral group-appellation and ancestry are thus intimately interwoven. The substitution of a general Hebrew designation (nasi') with an Arabic term with ex- plicit genealogical significance (al-ddwidT) points to the convergence of internal and external perceptions of the exilarchal family that centered on the primacy of its connection to David. Davidic ancestry was also popularized and articulated through the represen- tation of a lion on seals used by at least several members of the exilarchal dynasty. While only a few actual examples have been preserved, seals are mentioned fre- quently in medieval Jewish sources from the Near East, reflecting their important societal function as visual symbols of power.47 Their prevalence in Islamic lands is further indicated by a clause in the so-called "Pact of Umar" specifically pro- hibiting the dhimmi populations from inscribing their seals with Arabic.48 The connection between the Davidic family and the image of a lion has its textual inspiration in the blessing that Judah, the patriarchal progenitor of King David, received from Jacob: "Judah is a lion's whelp; on prey, my son, have you 46.

Seals borne by exilarchal dynasts are also mentioned in the travel accounts of Ben- jamin of Tudela and Samuel ben Samson, both of whom recognize them as a special dispensation of the Muslim authorities. Samuel ben Samson speaks of a nasi' who served as his guide in Hebron who had "a seal from the ruler and from Muhammad."

Like a lion he crouches, lies down, like a lion-who dares to rouse him?" (Genesis 49:9).49 Medieval exegetes, interpreting the lion as an allusion to David or the Messiah, imagined that its image adorned the banner carried by the tribe of Judah in the wilderness and similarly appeared on the pennants of the Davidic kings.5? Not only, then, did the representation of a lion on the seals of medieval exilarchs and nesi'im recall scriptural passages connected to the Davidic line, it re- capitulated an iconic practice that medieval Jews attributed to the Davidic kings themselves. The earliest physical evidence of a lion's image being used to promote the ancestry of a member of the exilarchal family is found on a tenth-century seal bear- ing the following circular Hebrew inscription: "Heman the son of .Hanamel the nasi' 'The Lord is my allotted share and my cup' (Psalms 16:5)."51 Depicted in the center of the seal is a lion with its head to the right and a star below its front legs. The scion of a family with recognized ties to David, Heman ben Hanamel cele- brated his ancestry on his seal through a combination of text and image.52 The an- cestral pride signaled by the inclusion of the title "nasi'" is repeated, visually, through the depiction of a lion, producing overlapping assertions of Heman's mem- bership in the Davidic family.53 49. Consider also the description of the lions that adorned Solomon's throne in 1 Kings 10:19-20. 50. For the connection between the "lion's whelp" and David, see, e.g., Rashi's comments on Genesis 49:9.

(Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1968), 3:234, 237, 6:82. The view that the kings of Judah also had pennants bearing the image of a lion is found in Ibn Daud, Book of Tradition, 59 (English). On the lion as a symbol for the exilarchate in the medieval Italian chronicle MegilatAhima'az, see Robert Bonfil, "Mitus, retorikah, historiyah?: 'iyun be-Megilat Ahima'az," in Tarbut ve-hevrah be-toldot Yis- ra'el bi-yemei ha-benayim: kovez ma'amarim le-zikhro shel Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, ed.

The seal, which is part of a private collection, is described in Shaul Shaked, "Jewish and Christian Seals of the Sassanid Period," in Studies in Memory of Gaston Wiet, ed. Miriam Rosen- Ayalon (Jerusalem, 1977), 25-26, 31. A photograph of a modern impression of the seal is provided at the end of the book, plate 4, #3. Shaked's reservations in that article about dating the seal to the Sas- sanid period are amplified in his "Epigraphica Judaeo-Iranica," in Studies in Judaism and Islam Pre- sented to Shelomo Dov Goitein, ed. Shelomo Morag, et al. (Jerusalem: Hebrew University of Jerusa- lem, 1981), 67, where he notes the late features in the seal's wording and arrangement and suggests that it dates from the tenth century. See also the concurring view of Yitzhak Naveh cited in Moshe Beer, "Sheloshah hotamot shel yehudim be-Bavel u-zemanam," Tarbiz 52 (1983): 441 n. 35, though Beer himself prefers an earlier dating. 52.

It is instructive to compare Heman's seal with that of another exilarchal dynast, Huna bar Nathan, also discussed in Shaked, "Epigraphica Judaeo-Iranica," (a photograph of the seal's impres- sion is provided at the end of the volume, plate 5-a). Unlike that of Heman, Huna bar Nathan's seal can be dated with confidence to the Sassanid period. Engraved around its top are the words "Huna bar Nathan," and below are depicted three relatively common motifs in Sassanid-era Jewish iconography: a palm branch, an etrog, and an incense shovel. Neither the seal's simple legend, nor its accompanying imagery, speaks to Huna's Davidic ancestry. It is tempting to conclude that the incorporation of Da- 105</page><page sequence="16">Arnold Franklin A document issued by the Iraqi ga'on Hayya ben Sherira (d. 1038) similar- ly reflects the use of a lion's image to publicize Davidic ancestry. In his famous Epistle to Jacob ben Nissim Ibn Shahin of Qayrawan, composed in the year 986/ 7, Hayya's father, Sherira ben Hananiah, twice records a tradition about his fami- ly's descent from the exilarchal dynasty. This ancestral claim is visually repre- sented on a court record on which Hayya's signature is accompanied by the image of a lion.54 Such a finding bears out the claim of Abraham Ibn Daud (d. 1180), who writes in Sefer ha-kabbalah that he saw an impression of Hayya's seal and that a lion was engraved on it. In 1286 the nasi' Jesse ben Hezekiah of Damascus issued a ban against the critics of Moses Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, to which he affixed his per- sonal seal. Although the original document has not survived, we have a copyist's description of the seal impression, which included the image of a lion with an arm raised to its head. The copyist does not specify whether the seal also bore a legend, but below the seal's impression the nasi' added the following: This is my decree and my seal, I, Jesse ben Hezekiah ben Jesse the nasi', along with the endorsement of my colleagues, the judges, and with them [the en- dorsement of] the notables and scholars, may God bless them. He who listens will be mindful, but the fool will forbear. As David gave warning, saying, "Lis- ten to me, my brothers and my people (1 Chronicles 28:2)!" Our sages said: "If [they are] 'my brothers' why [does he also say] 'my people,' and if [they are] 'my people' why [does he say] 'my brothers?' [The meaning of the verse is:] If you listen to me you are 'my brothers,' but if not you are 'my people' and I will rule over (erdeh) you with the scepter (ba-shevet) [B. Sotah 40a]." As it is written: "The scepter (shevet) shall not depart from Judah (Genesis 49:10)."55 Like Heman ben Hanamel on his seal, Jesse ben Hezekiah here combines the im- age of a lion with other carefully chosen cues to his Davidic ancestry. At first blush, his reference to David's warning in 1 Chronicles 28:2, along with its interpretation in B. Sotah 40a, seems unremarkable. Jesse, however, modifies the wording of the rabbinic passage-substituting "scepter" (shevet) for "rod" (makel)-with signif- icant consequences. In so doing, he foreshadows the citation of Genensis 49:10 vidic markers in Heman's tenth-century seal reflects a societal recognition of Davidic ancestry absent in Huna's time. Iconographic evidence, then, would seem to correlate with the shifts noted in connec- tion with naming practices and genealogies, shifts that point to Arab-Islamic culture's influence on the significance and meaning of Davidic ancestry in Jewish society in the Near East. Such a conclusion conforms, in broad strokes, with Shaked's classification, which distinguishes between "early," i.e., pre- Islamic, Jewish seals bearing only the owner's name and in certain cases a conventional iconographic image, and "late," i.e., Islamic-era, seals, which tend to be more embellished and personalized. 54.

This simple word substitution allows Jesse ben Hezekiah to move effortlessly ("As it is written ... ") from the rabbinic interpre- tation of 1 Chronicles 28:2 to Genesis 49:10, a connection not anticipated by the talmudic passage itself. The significance of Genesis 49:10, which directly follows Jacob's charac- terization of Judah as a lion, derives from its interpretation in rabbinic literature: "The scepter shall not depart from Judah-this refers to the exilarchs in Babylo- nia who rule over (she-rodin) Israel with the scepter (ba-shevet)."56 During the Middle Ages this interpretation continued to serve as a compelling textual basis for Davidic privilege, and it is therefore not surprising that Genesis 49: 10 was cit- ed both by and about exilarchs and nesi'im.57 We can be certain that Jesse ben Hezekiah had this interpretation in mind, for only by means of it is the connection he makes between Sotah 40a and Genesis 49:10 comprehensible. The reference to Genesis 49:10 would have also triggered associations with the messianic role as- signed to David's family on the basis of rabbinic interpretations of the last words of the verse: "until Shiloh comes." Through imagery and text, then, Jesse's seal im- pression and accompanying signature articulate an ideology of authority based on ties to the Babylonian exilarchs, King David, and the Messiah. A related example of the representation of Davidic ancestry by means of the lion of Judah comes from a letter sent sometime in the early-eleventh century by "the community of Gaza and those who were displaced there" to the court of the Palestinians in Fustat.58 The letter complains of the difficulties that Mevorakh ben Nathan of Gaza encountered as he tried to collect the estate of his brother Amram, who died in the town of Fayyum in Upper Egypt. The leaders of the Gaza com- munity delicately urge the Egyptian court-headed by Ephraim ben Shemaryah, himself a Gazan-to reconsider their position. The letter bears the signatures of fifteen community members, including the local representative of the Palestinian yeshivah, Yeshu'ah ha-haver ben Nathan, who claimed to be a descendant of the Davidic line.59 Yeshu'ah's signature is embellished with tiny letters written above and below his name, a common practice in documents from the Geniza. These let- ters, often written in code, spell out a motto of personal significance, and func- tioned like a handwritten seal.60 The letters written around Yeshu'ah ben Nathan's name spell the words nin gur aryeh ("scion of the lion's whelp"), alluding to Gen- esis 49:9. The same phrase also appears in conjunction with Yeshu'ah's name in the colophon to a collection of liturgical poetry, followed by the words "The scepter 56. B. Sanhedrin 5a. 57.

The extent to which the lion's image was perceived by medieval Jews as a marker of Davidic lineage is apparent in Abraham Ibn Daud's comments about Hayya ben Sherira that were briefly noted above: Of the geonim before him there was none like him, and he was the last of the geonim. He was of the House of David, of the royal line, of the descendants of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and of the princes (nesi'im) and exilarchs who came after him. I have seen his seal affixed to documents which he is- sued, and a lion was engraved in it just as there had been on the pennant of the camp of Judah and on the pennants of the kings of Judah. However, since the beginning of Muslim rule, the exilarchs did not exercise their authority fit- tingly. They used to buy their position with large sums of money, like publi- cans, and were worthless shepherds. Consequently his ancestors did not wish to become exilarchs, and they turned to the gaonate instead. He was also de- scended from Rabbah bar Abbuha.62 Ibn Daud's information is based on two unrelated passages in the famous Epistle of Hayya's father, Sherira ben Hananiah. Early in the text, which outlines the history of rabbinic tradition, Sherira writes that the Babylonian amora Rabbah bar Abbuha "was from the exilarchal family, and we have a tradition that we are from the exilarchal family and also are the descendants of Rabbah bar Abbuha."63 Later, describing the relations between the geonic yeshivot and the exilarchate, Sherira adds: The exilarchate wielded great and stern authority during the reign of the Per- sians and the Ishmaelites, for the latter would sell (appointments) to exilarchs for great sums, and there were among them those who caused great distress to the rabbis. Our ancestors were from the family of the exilarchs, but they aban- doned the deplorable ways of the exilarchate and joined the rabbis of the acad- emy, seeking modesty and humility.64 Clearly, Ibn Daud has rearranged the material from the Epistle, but he has also refocused it, adding greater emphasis to the ancestral connection between the ga'on's family and King David. Sherira notes that he is related to the family of the exilarchs, and, like all medieval Jews, he also knew that the exilarchs, in turn, claimed to be descendants of King David.65 But Sherira stopped short of boasting of his descent from David. Apparently of far greater significance to him were his ancestral ties to the Babylonian authority Rabbah bar Abbuha, which he mentions twice in the Epistle. It is Ibn Daud who connected the dots, as it were, producing 61. See Zulay, "Piyutim," 176. 62. Ibn Daud, Book of Tradition, 59. 63. Sherira ben Hananiah, lgeret rav Sherira, 60, cf. 82. 64.

Crucial to this transformation is Ibn Daud's discussion of Hayya's seal, which serves as "proof'" of the Davidic ancestry of the ga'on. Moreover, the rare irruption of Ibn Daud's voice in this passage, one of only a handful of times in Sefer ha-kabbalah where he conveys personal information, suggests the thrill that medieval Jews ex- perienced when they laid eyes on a symbol infused with such profound religious and historical significance. Enthusiasm about Hayya's Davidic ancestry is not unique to Ibn Daud, and may in fact be reflective of broader Andalusian interests in charting the biblical ge- nealogy of contemporary Jewish society.66 "Gone is the lamp that remained of David," laments the Malaga born Solomon Ibn Gabirol (d. ca. 1055) in a eulogy composed after Hayya's death in 1038, going on to urge the "sons of David" to car- ry out the rites of mourning. And in another composition in honor of the ga'on, Ibn Gabirol wonders "who shall wear the crown of Jesse's son?"67 Rapture over Hayya's Davidic ancestry reaches even greater heights in Seder ha-dorot, a chron- icle by the Granada native Se'adyah ben Maimon Ibn Danan (fl. second half of the fifteenth century) that is heavily indebted to Sefer ha-kabbalah. According to Ibn Danan, Hayya was the last of the geonim in Babylonia, the famous Hayya ... from the exi- larchs and the descendants of Rabbah bar Abbuha, from the line of Zerubba- bel and Shealtiel, the royal line, the line of Solomon the son of our lord David, the anointed one of the God of Jacob and the sweet singer of Israel. And with his seal he would make the impression of a lion just as the kings of Judah did.68 For both Ibn Danan and Ibn Daud, the lion's image on Hayya's seal was an unam- biguous statement about genealogy with an obvious precedent in the seals of the Davidic kings. Their perceptions, indicative of those of medieval Jewish society generally, underscore the effectiveness with which individuals claiming descent from King David could articulate their lineage through visual cues, much as they did with genealogies and names. The significance of the lion's image and its ability to convey in iconic form the ancestral claims of medieval Davidic dynasts can also be inferred from the sto- ry of Bustanai discussed earlier. The mosquito that, according to the text, became the symbol of the Davidic family is a crucial satiric element in the parody of the 66. See, for example, Cohen's discussion of the genealogical tradition employed in medieval "chain of transmission" histories in Ibn Daud, Book of Tradition, 1-lvi. 67. See Dov Yarden, Shirei ha- hol le-rabi Shelomo Ibn Gabirol (Jerusalem, 1975), 1:302-03. However, compare the long eulogy by Samuel ha-Nagid (d. 1056), which makes no reference to Hayya's ancestry, in idem, Divan Shemu'el ha-nagid (Jerusalem: Hebrew Union College Press, 1966), 1:231-36. 68.

See also Ibn Danan's chronology of Jewish kings, Ta'arikh malkhei Yehudah ve-Yisrael (History of the Kings of Judah and Israel). In a digression Ibn Danan lists several generations of descendants of Zerubbabel in Babylonia, and then concludes: "and from this noble line (came) the Babylonian exilarchs, and our master Rabbi Hayya Gaon the son of Rabbi Sherira Gaon."

If a lion's image evoked strength, histori- cal continuity, and a divine right to authority, the mosquito signified the very op- posite. Overly preoccupied with ingratiating himself with the temporal authorities, Bustanai is humbled and scarred by an insect. In fact, Bustanai is twice tainted by his intimacy with the caliph, once by the mosquito and a second time through his relations with the Persian princess. The importance of the exilarchate's seal as an articulation of Davidic lineage explains why it should be singled out for lam- pooning in a text concerned with discrediting the ancestry of medieval exilarchs and nesi'im. The sources discussed above suggest that by the eleventh century the exi- larchal dynasty had begun to identify itself with its biblical ancestor with a new and greater urgency. The disintegration of caliphal authority in Baghdad in the tenth century set in motion forces that conspired to undermine the stature and scope of exilarchal authority. In certain cases the beneficiaries of these develop- ments were the geonic yeshivot, which slowly expanded their range of activities to include responsibilities previously administered by the exilarchs. The exilarchate's redoubled efforts to identify itself with David may thus be viewed as a response to destabilization and decline. Confronting the erosion of its traditional sphere of in- fluence in Jewish society and its replacement by institutions founded on scholarly credentials, the exilarchate developed an alternate basis for legitimacy in an an- cestral claim that appealed both to Jewish longings for the biblical past and hopes for the messianic future. But these sources also suggest that during the tenth and eleventh centuries something was changing in the mentality of ordinary Jews living in the Islamic world as well. The appearance of nesi'im throughout the Near East, the production and circulation of Davidic genealogies and the deliberate association of nesi'im and exilarchs with King David through naming patterns and iconic imagery-all of this suggests a new interest in, and receptivity to, the value of kinship ties to the biblical monarch. While grounded in ancient rabbinic traditions about the family of the exilarchs, this fascination with the House of David was no less a product of the vigorous interaction between Jewish and Islamic culture in the Middle Ages- and Islamic society not only provided a nurturing environment for the cultivation of ties to David through its high regard for the Qur'dnic Dawild, it also offered Jews a ready-made paradigm of an ennobling lineage in its veneration for the family of Muhammad.
