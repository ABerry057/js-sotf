This man was Portuguese by birth, which meant that he was not allowed to go to the Spanish New World. Nevertheless, in 1579, Philip II awarded him a vast territorial entity in New Spain, called Nuevo Reino de Le?n, and allowed him to bring to it a large number of people without having to certify their being Old Christians. Nearly ten years later, he was apprehended by orders of Viceroy Manrique de Zu?iga and brought to Mexico City, where he was jailed in the Crown's prison. On April 14, 1589, he was transferred to the secret jails of the Spanish Inquisition, where he was subjected to a nine-month-long trial, accused of heresy, of knowingly bringing Jews to New Spain, and of conceal ing their religious activities. Ultimately, he was found guilty of the last two charges and was sentenced to a six-year exile from New Spain. However, before the sen tence was carried out, he was returned to the Crown's jail, where he died a year later. These events are related in many works, but, with few exceptions, the infor mation presented in them is based on the records of Carvajal 's trial, first mentioned by Vicente Riva Palacios and then transcribed in toto by Alfonso Toro.2 Those records make it clear that, knowingly or not, Carvajal brought many crypto Jews with him, a fact that has induced some writers to raise questions and to provide speculative answers of their own. Early among those writers was the dis tinguished Mexican historian Vito Alessio Robles, who asked, How could Carvajal obtain that royal decree, so magnanimous in privileges and yet without the requirements established by law? Did Jewish gold, always suitable for important tasks?particularly when the task relates to 1. This was the name our protagonist used throughout his life, although official documents dating from 1579 refer to him as Luis de Carvajal de la Cueva. This was done to differentiate him from two well-known men, also named Luis de Carvajal. One was the admiral of the Spanish Armada off the coast of Flanders during the 1550s. The other was an artist who was then painting some frescoes in El Escorial. 2. Vicente Riva Palacios, M?xico a Trav?s de los Siglos, vol.

Did Carvajal and his people want to establish a Jewish colony in the northern regions of New Spain to form there their new fatherland in order to escape the European religious intransigence, and to dedicate them selves to practice the Mosaic Law in complete freedom forty years before the pilgrims of the Mayflower attempted similar things? Did those Jews who sup ported such a large task dream of carving a new fatherland, forming a kingdom independent of Spain?3 A few years later, Mariano Cuevas, another distinguished Mexican historian, asked, How could a man without any merits, without having lost a drop of blood in the Americas, without any of the efforts of a conqueror, be assigned, all of a sudden, such a vast dominium? How was it possible to hide from the advisors of King Philip II that the Carvajals were renowned Jews, and that, since the families they brought to colonize were also Jewish, his capitulaci?n (a special type of royal grant) was equivalent to sowing and strengthening the worse of the weeds?4 Some of these points have been touched upon in many other works, including those of Primo Feliciano Velazquez,5 Julio Jimenez Rueda,6 Eugenio del Hoyo,7 Abelardo Leal, Jr.,8 Seymour Liebman,9 Robert Weddle,10 Martin Cohen,11 David Gitlitz,12 Richard Santos,13 David Raphael,14 and Stanley 3.

In this work we examine Carvajal's personal background, the reasons behind the appointment, and the allegation that he intentionally brought New Christians to the New World. On the basis of other sixteenth-century documents, contemporary with the events described in them, we conclude that the award was granted on the basis of his merits and services to the Crown, and not because of money (Jewish or not); that, although it is true that he brought with him many New Christians to the New World, he was not aware of their background or that many among them were crypto-Jews; and, finally, that he was a sincere Christian. The Royal Grant The royal document naming Luis de Carvajal as the governor of Nuevo Reino de Le?n was called a capitulaci?n because it consisted of several cap?tulos, or chapters. These chapters stipulated the conditions he had to fulfill, as well as the concessions and privileges he would receive from the king. Generally speaking, however, a capitulaci?n was an instrument that facilitated large enterprises that were important to the Crown and awarded its recipient considerable power and prestige. During the forty years that span the kingdom of Philip II, only fourteen such awards were made, with Carvajal's being one of two granted in the last twenty-five years. Although there must have been some favoritism in awarding some of these, most were granted on the basis of significant achievements,16 and only after a long process that was intended to verify the claims made by the individual seeking the grant. So, why did Carvajal receive such an honor? As the statements by Alessio Robles and Cuevas show, some historians think he did not deserve it and have speculated that somebody in the king's court, or even the king himself, was bribed by Jewish money.17 The possibility that he deserved the honor has been rejected by these historians because, in their view, Carvajal did not do anything meritorious, even though, in his self-defense before the Inquisition, he listed several deeds he claimed to have performed in the service of the Crown. These claims are now regarded as exaggerations, if not outright lies. For example, Hoyo stated that he had searched the archives very hard for evidence of some of Carvajal's claims, finding none.18 This, he said, proved that Carvajal did not do them, forgetting that lack of evidence is not evidence of lacking. 15.

Milagro del Vas Mingo, Las Capitulaciones de Indias en el Siglo XVI (Madrid: Instituto de Coperaci?n Interamericano, 1986). 17. Variants of this have also been proposed. For example, in El Nuevo Reyno de Le?n, p. 1, Leal quotes Alessio Robles as saying that Philip II took a 2 million ducat loan from Carvajal in exchange for Nuevo Reino de Le?n. 18. Hoyo, Historia de Nuevo Le?n, chap. IV 81</page><page sequence="4">Samuel Temkin No less speculative is the statement by Liebman19 that Carvajal's capitulaci?n was drafted by Antonio Perez, secretary to Philip II, who, he said, was a friend of the Jews, if not a crypto-Jew himself. The clear implication of these remarks is that Carvajal received some help from Perez. But the evidence, discussed later, shows that the capitulaci?n was written by scribes in the Real y Supremo Consejo de Indias20 and ratified by Antonio de Eraso, its secretary. Our own search of the Archivo General de Indias (AGI) in Seville uncov ered a document21 written a year before Carvajal's capitulaci?n that gives ample evidence of the services claimed by him. The document was prepared between January and March 1578 by the Real Audiencia de Mexico22 following the pro cedure established by the court for the purpose of verifying claims by those requesting royal favors. As its cover states, the document was an informaci?n de oficio that recorded the merits and services that Carvajal performed on behalf of the Crown.23 The informaci?n, referred to in some of the notes in this work as the MdC {m?ritos de Carvajal), includes a petition by him; a listing of the services he had performed by the end of 1577, after having spent ten years in New Spain; the sworn affidavits of thirty-three witnesses, most of whom had participated in Carvajal's activities; and, on the first page, the endorsement of the petition by the viceroy and the oidores, or judges, of the Audiencia de Mexico. In a previous work,24 we made use ofthat document to describe Carvajal's services to the Crown. Among those services was the discovery of a pass-through the mountains, a pass that opened vast territories for European settlement, some of which were explored by him and later became part of Nuevo Reino de Le?n. Other meritorious services included the pacification of several Indian rebellions, the capture of a large number of men left by John Hawkins on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and the building of a fort in the town of Xalpa, intended to secure the northern frontier. Each of the witnesses appearing before the audiencia expressed very posi tive views on Carvajal, which is not surprising given the nature of the inquiry. But among those witnesses we find several highly respected individuals whose views carried considerable weight before the Crown. One of these was Luis de 19. Seymour B. Liebman, Requiem por los Olvidados (Madrid: Altalena, 1984), 39. 20. The Real y Supremo Consejo de Indias was the body charged with advising Philip II on all matters concerning the Spanish territories in the New World. 21. AGI, Mexico, 103, S/N. The cover reads, "Informaci?n de Oficio recibida en la Real Audi encia de M?xico sobre la que dio el Capit?n Luis de Carvajal sobre sus M?ritos y Servicios." 22. The Real Audiencia de Mexico was the highest court in New Spain. It consisted of four to six oidores, or judges, appointed by the king, and the viceroy, who presided over it. 23. The document is cited in Spanish Sea by Weddle, who refers to it as Carvajal's "Declara tion." Unfortunately, his reading of the document is incorrect, for he believed it was the record of a trial against Carvajal, as his remarks on p. 338 show. There he states, "In January of 1578, he (Carvajal) was summoned to Mexico City to face accusations that he had deliberately falsified?to say the least, exag gerated, his own record, which was said to be less than honorable." 24. Samuel Temkin, "Los M?ritos y Servicios de Carvajal," Revista de Humanidades (Instituto Tecnol?gico de Monterrey), no. 21 (2006): 147-85. 82</page><page sequence="5">Luis de Carvajal and His People Villanueva, who had been an oidor of the Audiencia de Mexico for many years. In his testimony25 he said that "he has known said captain Luis de Carvajal for about twelve years and that he regards him to be a noblemen, an hidalgo, because he shows it in his behavior and treatment of his person, and deserves that H. M. use him in important and trustworthy tasks." Another highly respected individual was Don Francisco de Puga, the viceroy's lieutenant in the northern frontier, who stated that26 "he regards said captain Luis de Carvajal to be a nobleman and well born and that he is a man of courage and strength to carry out important tasks of war and of justice in the service of his majesty." The same view was expressed by some clergymen. The reference to Carvajal being well born indicates that he was regarded as an Old Christian. Furthermore, the description of his appearance and manners as those of a nobleman implies that he looked and acted like an aristocrat. This is important for many reasons, one of which is Carvajal's appearance in the Spanish court the year following the endorsement by the Audiencia de Mexico. The events that took place after that endorsement can be summarized as follows: After the Audiencia de Mexico verified the services Carvajal claimed to have performed, he went to Spain to lobby his case before the Consejo de Indias, carrying several documents supporting him.27 He probably also presented a notarized copy of the informaci?n de oficio issued by the audiencia, but the orig inal copy of that document had been sent separately by that body in sealed form. It is this copy that was found in the archives. Our search of the archives also produced several other documents that show the Consejo de Indias examined the evidence at hand, following the exact pro cedure stipulated by the Crown. The first such document,28 written early 1579, is a letter from the consejo to the king that includes a summary of Carvajal's merits and services and a new version of his petition. Elevating the request to the king meant that the consejo deemed those services to be meritorious and ensured that it would be approved. The king's initial response, appearing at the end of the petition and dated February 26, 1579, was favorable but did not give Carvajal everything he wanted. Taking advantage of the rules that applied to such petitions, Carvajal appealed the decision on some points. The appeal was endorsed by the consejo in another letter to the king, written near the end of March. The king's response to this appeal is missing, but it appears that he yielded on some of the points raised by Carvajal. Still not satisfied, Carvajal made another appeal on money and tax matters. This new appeal produced the desired results, as indicated by the king's responses appearing on the margins of the letter from the Consejo de Indias. Among the many points that were negotiated between the Crown and Carvajal, we find one that is relevant to the speculation that Jewish money was 25. AGI, Mexico, 103, S/N.

Letter from the Consejo de Indias to the king. 83</page><page sequence="6">Samuel Tem?an used to obtain the grant. We therefore include here the statements dealing with it. The issue has to do with certain bonds that the Crown wanted Carvajal to pay in Spain as a means to ensure that he would fulfill his obligations. The paragraph in Carvajal's appeal that deals with this reads, In the same manner, captain Luis de Carvajal says that Y.R.H. (Your Royal Highness) ordered him to pay bonds in the amount of 10,000 ducats at the time the agreement is signed. And because said bonds would be difficult for him to give in these kingdoms?the paying of which would make it impossible to proceed with the desire he has to use his assets and those of his relatives in the service of Y.R.H., as he has done until now. Because of this he begs Y.R.H. that it be sufficient for him to make the commitment to pay said amount. And that if he should pay some, he begs Y.R.H. order they be in the quantity of the licenses granted him by Y.R.H., to be paid in New Spain. The request is surprising, for it amounts to Carvajal haggling with the king about how much money he had to pay in bonds. But the reason is clear: Carvajal's funds in Spain were limited and were needed to pay the expenses associated with the journey. He thus asked that instead of paying the bonds, he be allowed to simply promise to pay them, and that if required to pay them, he begged that they be reduced. Furthermore, he requested that he be allowed to pay them in New Spain. From the perspective of the Crown, the amounts mentioned were insignificant, and it is therefore not surprising to see the king agreeing to both requests. His response, written in his own hand on the margin of the document, was as follows: "Let the bond be eight thousand ducats, which he can pay in Mexico (City), to the satisfaction of the viceroy and audiencia" It is obvious that this request by Carvajal, together with the king's response, does away with the Jewish conspiracy theory. The foregoing points appear in a letter from the Consejo de Indias to the king dated April 14, 1579. This letter seems to have concluded the negotiations between the Crown and Carvajal. The next step, after the preparation of the final document by the consejo, was the actual presentation of the capitulaci?n. That ceremony took place in Aranjuez on May 31, 1579. Very likely, Carvajal received the signed document from the king himself. Finally, on June 14, 1579, the Crown issued twenty-one c?dulas, or royal orders. Some of these ordered various Crown officers to help Carvajal in his tasks, and some others granted him special privileges and rights. The latter were given to him between June 30 and July 6, 1579. Copies also exist in the AGI. Apparently only the first six c?dulas were handed to Carvajal in person, for only these six contain a brief paragraph on their margins where he acknowledged having received the originals. The People of Carvajal During his Inquisition trial, Carvajal stated that he had brought to Nuevo Reino de Le?n one hundred farmers, soldiers, and their families. When asked who among them were closest to him, he listed the names of about forty. This 84</page><page sequence="7">Luis de Carvajal and His People group consisted of twenty-five men, some women and minors, his pilot, and the viceroy's son. Asked whether they had presented proof of not being "of the forbid den," he said that they did not have to because the king had issued a c?dula order ing they could pass into New Spain without it. This statement, together with the fact that some members of his sister's family were later burned at the stake as Judaizers, is probably the origin of the modern idea that Carvajal brought with him a large number of crypto-Jews with the purpose of establishing a religious haven in Nuevo Reino de Le?n. If true, the idea implies, of course, that Carvajal himself was a crypto-Jew. To assess the weight of both charges, we consider, in some detail, the iden tity of the people he brought to New Spain. This identity has been of considerable interest in the past, particularly after Alessio Robles published an article called "La Juder?a de Monterrey," in which he stated that most of the residents of that city were the descendents of Jews. Several authors have since presented arguments in favor of and against the idea. However, whether the statement is true or not, evi dence exists that shows that many of the early settlers of Nuevo Reino de Le?n were, in fact, Sephardim. The issue is considered at length in chapter 4 of Hoyo's 1972 Historia de Nuevo Le?n. In that work, he presented several lists of people who, he said, came with Carvajal. To compile these lists, he used the list of passengers of a ship called Santa Catalina, which he believed was Carvajal's (although no evidence for this exists); the names provided by Carvajal before the Inquisition; and the names of many Judaizers tried by the Inquisition, whom Hoyo added to his count without providing any supporting evidence that they came with Carvajal. However, a document found in the mid-1970s by Peter Boyd-Bowman29 provides us with the correct information about the people brought by Luis de Car vajal to the New World. The document, sometimes referred to as the "Relaci?n de las Personas," is the official list of the people whom Carvajal declared in 1580 as going to New Spain with him. For simplicity, we shall refer to it as the "1580 list." This official list differs in significant and important ways from the lists presented by Hoyo in his 1972 book. For example, Hoyo's lists include forty-three individ uals not mentioned in the 1580 document. Hoyo himself considered those differ ences in a paper published in 1978,30 but he reiterated the validity of his lists using, as support, his own 1972 lists. Regrettably, his lists and arguments continue to be used, as shown, for example, by the recent books by Raphael and by Hordes.31 Let us now consider the 1580 list. First of all, notwithstanding Hoyo's work, it is our opinion that the 1580 list and the list of people mentioned by Carvajal 29. AGI, Contrataci?n, 5538.L.1\1\478 recto-483 recto. A pal?ographie version by Israel Cavazos was published in 1977 by the Direcci?n General de Investigaciones Humanisticas de la Uni versidad Aut?noma de Nuevo Le?n. 30.

Of course, the Inquisition list is of limited value because it only mentions the names of some colonizers. On the other hand, the 1580 list is substantially more extensive and detailed. In it, we read the names of those indi viduals Carvajal declared in Seville, their places of origin, and the names of their parents. This information is most useful in any attempt to ascertain the religious and ethnic background of those who came with Carvajal. The introductory paragraph of the 1580 list reads, Declaration of the persons that I, Luis de Carvajal de la Cueva, name to take with me to the discovery, pacification and colonization of the provinces that will be called the Nuevo Reino de Le?n, which is in Nueva Espa?a, in confor mity with the Capitulaci?n that H.M. ordered be taken with him about the above; which persons have to be one hundred, sixty of whom married farmers with their wives, sons and daughters, and the remaining soldiers, as it appears in a c?dula by H.M., which reads as follows. After this paragraph, the document contains a copy of the royal c?dula referred to by Carvajal before the Inquisition. That c?dula was the first of twenty-one issued by the king to aid Carvajal in his tasks, and it is of considerable interest because it freed Carvajal's people from having to prove their limpieza de sangre. However, the king did not nullify the limpieza requirement. The corresponding part of the text says, To our officers residing in Seville, in the Casa de la Contrataci?n?2 I order you to allow captain Luis de Carvajal to return to New Spain, taking with him a hundred men, sixty of whom married farmers with their wives and sons and daughters, and the remaining soldiers and officers... without asking any of them information of any kind, because by means of this we charge said captain Luis de Carvajal to be careful that all of them be clean, and not of the forbidden, and, specially, that none of the married men leaves his wife in these kingdoms. All of which you will obey without any impediment. The statement makes it clear that the king insisted that the people taken by Carvajal should be Old Christians (everybody else was "of the forbidden"). But instead of letting the officers in Seville verify the limpieza de sangre of each person in the group, he transferred that delicate function to Carvajal. This proved what Carvajal said before the Inquisitors but only added more fuel to the idea that the Crown had been suborned. What could have prompted the king to issue a decree that, in effect, enabled Carvajal to bring with him whomever he chose? The answer is twofold. First, it is clear that the king trusted him. Second, and probably more important, time was 32. The Casa de la Contrataci?n was the royal institution in Seville that dealt with all commer cial trade with the Spanish New World.</page><page sequence="9">Luis de Carvajal and His People short. The issue of trust is proven by the great honor that the king bestowed Carvajal. The timing question requires a longer explanation. Accustomed as we are to immediate response and action, it is easy to fail to understand the pace in the six teenth century. After receiving his c?dulas from the Crown, Carvajal had to carry out certain tasks that included buying and equipping a vessel to transport his people, supplying it with provisions for a long voyage, obtaining armaments to defend his territory and to conquer other lands still in possession of unfriendly Indians, and, most importantly, recruiting up to one hundred men to join him. He knew that the time available to carry out these tasks was less than a year because his ship would be departing next spring as part of the Spanish fleet going to the New World. Therefore, he must have argued that recruiting such a large number of people would be a time-consuming effort that would leave little time to obtain the necessary certificate of limpieza, as each would require a lengthy process.33 But recruiting people to go to New Spain was not easy. For one thing, the number of men willing to go there at that time had been significantly reduced by previous emigrations. Boyd-Bowman's work shows that slightly more than 80 percent of those who went to the New World in the sixteenth century did so prior to 1580. Also, Spaniards who still wanted to go there preferred places where silver and gold had already been found, but all Nuevo Reino de Le?n could offer at this stage was hope. Nevertheless, Carvajal managed to enlist a good number of men to accompany him. The 1580 list shows eighty-three men, thirty-four married and forty-nine single, apparently short of the allotted one hundred. But it should be remembered that the list included only those who did not have their limpieza documents. These people were allowed to go to New Spain because of Carvajal's declaration, as stipulated by the king. But individuals who had those documents? such as the viceroy's son?did not need to be included in the list in order to go to New Spain with Carvajal. This means that others must have come along, but among these, we are certain of only about ten whom Carvajal mentioned before the Inquisition, five of whom were not colonizers, and a certain Diego de Villalobos, whose name appears after the last of Carvajal's c?dulas. In any event, the 1580 list mentions all of those who did not have proof of their limpieza and therefore includes most, if not all, of the individuals of Jewish descent. Excluding Carvajal himself, the total number of individuals appearing in the 1580 list is 196?117 adults and 79 minors. If to these we add the five mentioned separately by Carvajal, we arrive at a total of slightly more than 200. Although this number appears to be small, it, in fact, implies that the year 1580 experienced a several-fold increase in the migration rate. For example, the data obtained by Boyd-Bowman show that in the last two decades of the sixteenth century, a yearly average of only fifteen individuals went to New Spain. Even more significant is the large number of females brought there by Carvajal. According to the 1580 list, that number was seventy, whereas the average number per year 33. Peter Boyd-Bowman, "Patterns of Spanish Emigration to the Indies until 1600," Hispanic American Historical Review 56, no. 4 (1976): 580-604. 87</page><page sequence="10">Samuel Temkin was fewer than five. One can only imagine the impact that Carvajal's people had on the demographic and cultural development of New Spain. The main question raised by the 1580 list is whether Carvajal fulfilled his obligation to ensure that none of the people going to the New World were of the forbidden. The evidence seems to indicate he did not. For one thing, some of the relatives who came with him were later found to be of Jewish descent. This does not mean that Carvajal knew this or that he purposefully ignored the king's charge. Rather, it means that, thinking himself an Old Christian?as he later insisted before the Inquisition?he simply assumed that all other members of his family were also, and therefore he felt no need to look into their back grounds. This issue will be considered later. What about the other recruits? Although in some isolated cases the 1580 list seems to point to a Jewish background, the information available shows that Car vajal paid no attention to the limpieza ofthose who were willing to join him. What mattered to him was the recruitment of farmers, soldiers, and officers for Nuevo Reino de Le?n. However, to achieve his goal, he had to seek help from others, giving them ample powers. Two such individuals were Alonso Rodriguez and Diego Ruiz de Ribera. Documents in the Archivo Hist?rico de Protocolos (AHP) in Seville,34 written less than four months before departure, show that Car vajal empowered them to "receive as colonizers of Nuevo Reino de Le?n any persons, so long as they are married farmers." This carte blanche does away with the idea that Carvajal was very careful, as required by the king, in making sure those enlisted "were not of the forbidden." The same archive contains several contracts Carvajal made with some of the recruits during late January and early February 1580. These contracts are of considerable interest on their own because they show what he offered to those who joined him and what he expected of them. Among the married men, we see contracts with Diego de Madrid, a mason worker from Seville,35 and with Juan de Saucedo de Espinoza,36 a carpenter from the town of Guadalupe in the province of Extremadura. Among the single men, we have a contract with two men from the province of Le?n37 and another with five38 from Espinoza de los Monteros in the province of Asturias. Each of these individuals was promised free passage to the New World, release from having to provide information about their limpieza, and a promise to treat them preferentially in the distribution of lands and other privileges granted by the king. 34.

To guar antee that the contracts would be fulfilled, each recruit had to promise to pay 50,000 maraved?s (about 135 ducats)?half to the Crown, and the other half to Carvajal. Further, to ensure that the married men and their families would arrive in the port of San Lucar de Barrameda by mid-April ofthat year to board Carva jal's ship, each married man had to give Carvajal 30 ducats, which would be returned once he was on board. The corresponding figure for single men was 20 ducats, an amount equal to the price of passage to the New World. It is difficult to believe that these requirements would have been imposed on people selected to colonize Nuevo Reino de Le?n on the basis of their religion. The foregoing statements are not meant to imply that Carvajal did not bring with him people who were either New Christians or crypto-Jews. He obviously did. However, the 1580 list does not tell us who or how many of the people who came with him were of the forbidden. There are, however other indications in it that provide some help in this task. It should pointed out, however, that although this list is the most reliable source of information regarding these people, the personal data contained in it cannot be entirely trusted because some of the listed individuals may have chosen to give false family surnames or places of origin. This custom was prevalent among those born in Portugal because they were not allowed to go to the Spanish New World.39 For example, the document states that Carvajal and his sister Francisca were born in Benavente, which, as we know, was not true. Incidentally, although the sister's name was Francisca Nu?ez, she appears in the list as Francisca de Carvajal. Consider first the Carvajal family, which, as the inquisitorial records show, was of Jewish descent. The same conclusion follows by examination of the Carvajal Le?n family tree. This is shown in figure 1, starting with Carvajal's grandparents and ending with his nieces and nephews. Included there are estimated birth years of some individuals, as well as their supposed places of birth. Though approximate, these dates show that Carvajal's family originated in Spain but moved to Portugal some years after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, only to return to Spain at a later time. These border crossings were related to the activities of the Iberian Inquisi tions and show that both the V?zquez-Carvajal and the Le?n-Nu?ez families were New Christians, whether its members, including Carvajal, were aware of it or not. Later, we shall examine the religion of the members of the family. For now, we may, with some certainty, conclude that each of the twenty-three blood or in-law rela tives of Carvajal who appear in the 1580 list were New Christians. Less reliable, but probably correct, is to count as a New Christian every listed individual who had a Portuguese origin and came from the border region 39. It is true that the annexation of Portugal by Philip II opened the door through which many Portuguese crypto-Jews went to the New World, but that event took place in the second half of 1580, after Carvajal and his people had left Spain. See Francisco Ribeiro da Silva, Filipe II de Espa?a, rei de Portugal (Zamora: Fundaci?n Rei Alfonso Henriquez, 2000). ?Q</page><page sequence="12">'?&lt; ? Figure 1. The V?zquez-Carvajal and Le?n-Nu?ez families. o</page><page sequence="13">Luis de Carvajal and His People between Spain and Portugal?La Raya de Portugal, as it was then known. The reason for this inclusion is, essentially, that those who lived on the Spanish side of La Raya and had a Portuguese background were the descendants either of Jews who had been expelled from Spain or of Spanish crypto-Jews who first moved to Portugal to escape the Spanish Inquisition and then returned to Spain to escape the Portuguese Inquisition. The New Christian origin of those individ uals can be deduced from their birthplace, that of their parents, or from their Por tuguese naming tradition surname. Although any one of these factors points to such an origin, we label as New Christians only those whose background includes two or more of these factors. This procedure indicates that about one-half of those who originated in La Raya were New Christians. Excluding Carvajal's family, this conservative esti mate adds another seventy-three individuals to our count of the forbidden. While only approximate, the count indicates that at least ninety-six individ uals40?or nearly 50 percent of those who came with Carvajal?were of Jewish descent.41 Furthermore, their background, and the fact that they chose to go to the New World at that time, makes it very likely that every adult in the group practiced Judaism, even if only in a limited manner.42 Minors were normally told about these practices only after they reached an age or displayed a level of maturity such that they could be trusted with the knowledge of the crypto-Jewish practices of their parents. For example, Luis de Carvajal el Mozo, Carvajal's well-known nephew, told the inquisitors that he did not learn about his parents' secret religious practices until after they arrived in New Spain (when he was thir teen or fourteen) "because his father had not wanted to tell him until then because he was a young boy."43 It is likely that the same restrictions applied to other chil dren in the New Christian families coming with Carvajal, which means that many of them, if not all, were also converted after arrival in New Spain. The foregoing argument shows that a good number of those who came with Carvajal were New Christians and that most of the latter group were crypto-Jews. Some authors believe that Carvajal must have known about the New Christian background of his family prior to his return to New Spain,44 but evidence for this is elusive. Sitting in his cell nearly ten years after the voyage, he wondered how could he have missed noticing that brother-in-law Francisco Rodriguez and his wife Francisca were Judaizers. It was then that he recalled a letter that Francisco had sent him in 1579 in which he had said he was thinking of taking 40. Among these ninety-six, we count forty-nine adults, seventeen of whom were females, and forty-seven minors, twenty-four of whom were female. 41. A much higher proportion is given hy Eugenio del Hoyo. However, as pointed out earlier, his lists include people who did not come with Carvajal. 42. As explained at length by Gitlitz, Secrecy and Deceit, the Judaism practiced by crypto-Jews was limited to following only a few Jewish rituals, such as keeping the Sabbath and keeping some dietary laws. 43. Procesos de Luis de Carvajal (elMozo) (Archivo General de La Naci?n, M?xico, 1935), 55. The quotation also appears in Toro, Los Jud?os en la Nueva Espa?a en el Siglo XVI, 249. 44. See, e.g., Cohen, The Martyr, 56-58. 91</page><page sequence="14">Samuel Temkin his family to France. This letter made Carvajal realize he should have suspected them of being Jewish "because he knew that Jews wanting to escape the Inquisi tion used to go there." Informing the inquisitors of this realization, as he later did, cost him the additional charge that he had knowingly brought to New Spain people who practiced Judaism under cover. But that charge was patently false. Carvajal's Background In response to the many charges lodged by the prosecutor of the Spanish Inquisition, Carvajal insisted that he was a good Christian and that his parents and grandparents were Old Christians. Eventually, the heresy charge was dropped for lack of proof, although the inquisitors remained suspicious that he adhered to the Mosaic law, as the trial's long summary and sentence show. Modern historians dealing with the question as to whether Carvajal was a crypto-Jew have arrived at different answers, even though they all have used the same sources, namely, the inquisitorial records. For example, Alessio Robles,45 Cuevas,46 and Hoyo47 clearly implied that Carvajal was Jewish. Primo Feliciano Velazquez,48 on the other hand, stated emphatically that Carvajal "was not born in Mogadouro and was not the son of new-Christians." Finally, some American writers such as Martin Cohen49 and Seymour Liebman50 have unambiguously stated that Carvajal was a Christian. The inquisitorial evidence for Carvajal's being Christian does seem strong, as his sister and her children stated he was a good one. It may, however, be argued that these statements were not truthful, as implied by the inquisitors' suspicion. In fact, the Inquisition's prosecutor wanted to subject Carvajal to torture in order "to get the truth," insisting, to the end of the trial, that more serious charges against him could be proven. In any event, the inquisitors were completely convinced that Carvajal was a New Christian. But Carvajal's claim about his background cannot be disregarded. It is, of course, possible that he sincerely believed himself to be an Old Christian. He cer tainly knew he was Portuguese, but that fact did not affect his belief that his family was an old hidalgo family. Furthermore, his demeanor was, as we have seen, that of a Spanish nobleman. In any event, he continued to deny, forcefully and repeat edly, a New Christian origin. To address these points, we need to examine Carvajal's early years, as well as some information about his ancestors, using both the inquisitorial records and other documents that have not been examined in the past. The point of departure is the year of his birth. In April 1589, Carvajal told Inquisitor Bonilla that he was about fifty years old, which would make 1539 the year of his birth. But a 45.

However, she added that she could be younger. To simplify matters, we take her birth year to be 1540 and take 1538 to be the year of Carvajal's birth. The birth years of some of his ancestors, estimated here, are also important. Because of the many names that appear in the discussion, we refer the reader to figure 1, where most of those names appear. Consider first the birth years of Carvajal's father, Gaspar de Carvajal, and grandfather, Gutierre Vazquez de la Cueva. We know that Carvajal was born in Mogadouro, a town in northeast Portugal, and that he was the first child of Gaspar de Carvajal and Catalina de Le?n. Gaspar's brothers were Melchor Vazquez and Juan de Carvajal. The difference in the surnames of Melchor, Gaspar, and Juan stems from the different naming traditions in Portugal and Spain.51 Thus, because the surnames of both Gaspar and his brother Juan listed their mother's family name first, we must assume they were born in Portugal. However, their older brother, Melchor Vazquez, carried his father's family name, which implies he was born in Spain. Now, from Carvajal's deposition, we learn that his paternal grandfather, Gutierre Vazquez, was born in the land of Sayago, which is near Zamora. Because his first son was born in Spain and the remaining two in Portugal, we see that he and his wife, Francisca de Carvajal, left Spain between the births of their first and second sons. The date for the move is important because it may tell us their reasons for leaving Spain. Regrettably, we do not know the year when Melchor and his brothers were born. Nevertheless, we can estimate the date of the family's departure using Carvajal's birth date as a reference point. As elaborated in a footnote,52 we estimate that Gutierre Vazquez de la Cueva and his wife Francisca de Carvajal left Spain between 1505 and 1510, that is, about fifteen years after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. The only reasonable explanation for the move is that they were Spanish crypto-Jews who decided to escape to Portugal when the Inquisition became powerful in the Zamora region. The Portuguese town where they settled is unknown, but it must have been near Zamora. But vicinity was not the only reason to settle there. Like many others who lived in La Raya de Portugal,53 Gutierre probably had business and social connections there, which meant he must have carried himself as a Christian. It is therefore likely that his crypto-Jewish practices were not known there. Thus, 51. In the Spanish tradition, a person's given name is followed by the surname of his or her father and then by that of the mother. In the Portuguese tradition, the surname order is reversed, so that the surname of the father appears last. However, in both traditions, it is the father's surname that is transmitted to the following generation. 52. To arrive at these dates, we have assumed that Gaspar de Carvajal was in his mid- to late twenties when Carvajal was born. Though not exact, this range indicates that Gaspar was born around 1510. Proceeding in the same manner and remembering that Gaspar was the second-born son of Gutierre, we estimate that Carvajal's paternal grandfather was born around 1480 and married around 1505. The move to Portugal thus took place between the births of Melchor after 1505 and of Gaspar in 1510. 53. Pilar Huerga Criado, En la Raya de Portugal (Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad de Sala manca, 2001). 93</page><page sequence="16">Samuel Temkin even though the Portuguese Inquisition had not yet been installed?that event occurred in 153654?Gutierre and his wife probably continued to practice their very limited form of Judaism under cover. It is likely that their children did, too. Incidentally, Gutierre Vazquez and Francisca de Carvajal also had a daugh ter, who, unlike her brothers, did not carry either her father's or her mother's name but was known as Isabel Nunez. A possible explanation for this is that she was named after a dead relative or was raised in the house of a family having that surname. As it turns out, one such family lived in Mogadouro. Now consider Carvajal's maternal ancestors. We know that his maternal grandfather, Antonio de Le?n, lived in Mogadouro and married Francisca Nu?ez, a woman born there. His last name suggests a Spanish origin, an indication that seems to be confirmed by his eventual return to Benavente. It should be noted that both of Carvajal's grandmothers lived in Mogadouro. It is therefore very likely that the V?zquez-Carvajal and the Le?n-Nu?ez families knew each other well. Furthermore, it is also likely that a connection, possibly familial, existed between the two families. This connection is implied by the surname of Carvajal's aunt, Isabel Nu?ez, and by the appearance of that name in later generations. What is certain is that Gaspar de Carvajal married Catalina de Le?n, a daugh ter of Antonio de Le?n and Francisca Nu?ez. The year of the wedding was around 1536, the year the Portuguese Inquisition was established in Portugal. The first child born to Gaspar de Carvajal and Catalina de Le?n was our protagonist. Following him were Antonio de Carvajal and Domingo de Carvajal. A daughter was also born after Luis, whose name was Francisca Nu?ez, possibly in memory of her maternal grandmother. However, according to Carvajal, his sister was "given" to an aunt, possibly Isabel, who raised her. Francisca's age at the time of the transfer was three years, which means it took place around 1543. The surname of our protagonist requires some explanation. As we know, he was born in Portugal, but his surname was Carvajal like his father's, not de Le?n like his mother's, as it should have been given that he was born in Portugal. A possible explanation is that in Mogadouro, young Luis was known as Luis de Le?n Carvajal, a name that would have remained with him had he lived longer in Portugal. But at a young age, he was taken by his father to Spain. There, the custom required Gaspar 's son to be named after him, which is how, we believe, young Luis's name was recorded. Did Carvajal and his brothers know of the Jewish origin of the family? Prob ably not. By the time Luis was a few years old, the Portuguese Inquisition had become active in the region where they lived. Crypto-Jewish families did their best to protect themselves from it, and one way to do so was to keep their religious practices hidden from their children until they could be entrusted with the big secret. Simply stated, Carvajal and his brothers were much too young to be told the truth. By the mid-1540s, the Portuguese Inquisition had become stronger than its Spanish counterpart, and this prompted the family to go to Spain. If our estimate of 54. J. Lucio D'Azevedo, Historia dos Christ?os Novos Portugueses (Lisbon: Livraria Classica Editora, 1921). 94</page><page sequence="17">Luis de Carvajal and His People Carvajal's year of birth is correct, the move took place in 1546. The family settled in Benavente, where both Gaspar de Carvajal and Catalina de Le?n had connec tions and possibly some relatives. It is also possible that Catalina's parents and her brothers and sisters went to Benavente at the same time, for Carvajal tells us that his maternal grandfather died there. The next few years in Carvajal's life remain in obscurity. Carvajal's own account in his trial glosses over this period of his life: He said that he was born and raised in the village of Mogadouro, that he went to school there until the age of eight, that with his father he went to Sahagun (in Spain) to see the Abbot, who was a relative, and to Salamanca to serve his father, who was sick and who then died in Benavente. And that his uncle Duarte de Le?n55 came there and took him to Lisbon... from where he was sent to Cape Verde in which island he was thirteen years. Later he added that he was ten years old when his father died in Benavente. Some authors believe that it was then, at age ten, that Carvajal was taken to Lisbon, but, as we will show, that conclusion is not supported by the documen tary evidence. The issue is important because that period in Carvajal's life includes part of his formative years. We do know he was eight years old when his family moved to Spain and that, at least on the surface, the family was Christian. But the evidence presented so far does not tell us what he did during this period or how old he was when he was taken to Cape Verde. To estimate that age, we recall that on April 17, 1589, when he first confronted the inquisitor, he said he had been married more than twenty-two years earlier, which of course was true because he had arrived in New Spain in 1567. But the year of the marriage cannot be ascertained from that statement alone. Carvajal also stated that "he had lived married in Seville for two years before going to New Spain." It thus appears that he was married not later than 1565. Confirmation of this exists in a recently found document that deals with a request by Miguel Nunez, Carvajal's father-in-law, before the Casa de la Contrataci?n, or House of Trade, in Seville. In that document, we read that in November 1575, several witnesses stated that Carvajal had married Nunez's daughter, Guiomar, "ten or eleven years earlier," that is, between 1564 and 1565. If the wedding took place the year he returned to Europe, after thirteen years in Cape Verde, we find that Carvajal left Benavente in 1551, not quite four teen years old. So, starting at the age of eight, Carvajal spent five to six years in Spain before going to Cape Verde. What did he do during that period? We know that he did not live with his parents and that his father took him to several places, prob ably looking for a place where he could get an education. However, we do not 55. According to the Inquisition records of Carvajal's nephew by the same name, this Duarte de Le?n was a rich man who lived in Lisbon and whose son-in-law was don Rodrigo de Castro (see Luis de Carvajal, {el Mozo), Archivo General de la Naci?n, M?xico, 1935, p. 364). This Don Rodrigo de Castro seems to have been a distinguished sixteenth-century Jewish physician born in Portugal. 95</page><page sequence="18">Samuel Temkin know where he was left, though we know that at the age of ten, he was at his father's deathbed in Benavente. A hint about those years exists in the first history of Nuevo Reino de Le?n, written in 1649 by Alonso de Le?n.56 In that work, we read that "since a tender age, (Carvajal) was brought up with a gentleman of the Court in Castile, where he learned the language and good manners and habits." These statements have been disregarded by some historians as being an "apology and a loving biogra phy,"57 but separate evidence shows that they are true. That evidence exists in the document, referred to earlier, that records Miguel Nunez's attempt to get a permit to do business in the New World. In that legal process, Nu?ez gave several reasons to support his request. Among his arguments, he stated that he had been born in Spain, not in Portugal; that he had lived many years in Seville; and that his daughter Guiomar was married to a Spanish gentleman by the name of Luis de Carvajal, who had been brought up in the house of the Count of Benavente.58 This is a new and important finding. Simply stated, five or six of Carvajal's formative years were spent in the house of a member of the Spanish court. This upbringing gave him the polished language, manners, and habits of a Spanish nobleman, all of which explain why other Spaniards, including the viceroy in New Spain, the members of the king's Consejo de Indias, and even the king himself, regarded him as a high-class Spaniard. In addition to learning to speak and behave as a nobleman, Carvajal's Chris tian indoctrination, which must have started in Portugal, was completed during that period. As Alonso de Le?n put it, "with that upbringing he always behaved as a good Christian; very devout to Our Lady, to whom he prayed every day." We should add that many contemporary documents show that Carvajal had a special interest in the church and in the conversion of the Indians. One of these documents is a letter he sent to Pedro Moya de Contreras, the archbishop of Mexico and the first inquisitor of New Spain.59 In that letter, Carvajal tells the archbishop that he (Carvajal) belongs to his house. Although we do not know what he meant by this, it is clear that Carvajal was close to the archbishop. Also revealing is an eyewitness account60 of a small action by Carvajal that is worth repeating here. The event occurred during 1575-76, many years before he was brought before the Spanish Inquisition?that is, when he had no need to prove anything regarding his religious beliefs. At that time, Carvajal was asked by the viceroy to suppress a rebellion by the Indians in the Xalpa region.61 After accomplishing that task, he built there a fort to provide some protection 56.

The fort housed a church and a monastery, and, as the witness tells us, To insure that the Indians be properly indoctrinated in the Catholic faith, captain Luis de Carvajal ordered that the prayers of Our Lady should be sung every day and on holidays, in a small chapel that he made, with the peaceful Indians. And he made the rebelling Indians gather there so that they would learn the Christian doctrine... And said captain, with his person, would bring the little ones to the chapel. In our opinion, this simple gesture provides considerable support for Carvajal's repeated claim that he was a sincere Christian. The Religion of Carvajal's Wife Somewhat peripheral, but still relevant to this work, is Carvajal's marriage to Guiomar Nunez.62 She appears in this narrative because, according to most works dealing with the Carvajal family, she was a fanatic Jew whose desire to convert her husband to her religion initiated the downfall of the family. The idea that she was a Judaizer stems from the inquisitorial trial of Carvajal's niece, Isabel, who told the inquisitor that Guiomar kept the Sabbath and obeyed Jewish dietary laws. Although this and other statements were made while she was threatened with torture, it is possible that she was telling the truth. After all, the Nunez family had a Portuguese origin, and this pointed to a crypto-Jewish back ground. However, no evidence has been found that supports her contention. Contradicting Isabel's declaration, we have that of Carvajal, who, in his self defense, stated that "his wife and her sisters were very good Catholic Christians." Most authors who have dealt with this issue have accepted Isabel's statement, insisting that Carvajal could not have missed noticing her unusual activities. This is incorrect on two accounts. First, it takes for granted that Guiomar and her family were crypto-Jews, an assumption that rests entirely on hearsay obtained under coercion, and that, at least in part, was later proven wrong. Second, during the two years that Luis and Guiomar lived together, he was a sea merchant, spend ing little time in Seville. If Guiomar was, in fact, following Mosaic laws, her activities could have been easily disguised. Let us now review the available information regarding the Nunez family. Some of this information has not been presented before but exists in the previously mentioned document, which describes the request by Miguel Nunez to be allowed to do business in the New World. In 1575, before the judges of the Casa de la Con trataci?n in Seville, Miguel Nu?ez stated that his family originated in Curiel, in Spain; that his parents were ?u?o Alvarez and Isabel Nu?ez;63 and that they 62. This was Guiomar's name until the death of her father in late 1579 or early 1580, after which she changed her surname to Ribera. 63. This is, apparently, the first time that the names of Nunez's parents have surfaced. Inciden tally, it is possible that Nunez's mother was related to Francisca Nu?ez, Carvajal's maternal 97</page><page sequence="20">Samuel Temkin had moved to Lisbon when he was two or three years old. He also said that he was more than fifty years old and that, since 1560, he had been living in Seville after having spent many years in Santo Domingo, doing business with those engaged in the slave trade. Whether he was born in Spain, as he claimed, is uncertain. His surname follows the Portuguese tradition, but this could have been given to him after the family moved to Portugal, when he was about three years old. If true, the family left Spain around 1524, possibly to escape from the Spanish Inquisition, years before its Portuguese counterpart was established. In Portugal, ?u?o and Isabel probably practiced Judaism under cover, but we have no way of ascertain ing whether Miguel was told about those practices, although in 1541, a wheat trader by the name of Miguel Nu?ez was mentioned as having sided with a Jew on a religious argument.64 We do not know whether this person was Guiomar's father, but the possibility arises because, after moving to Spain, he was engaged in the wheat trade. The marriage occurred near the end of 1564, soon after Carvajal returned from Cape Verde. Almost certainly, it was prearranged. It is likely that Miguel Nu?ez and Luis de Carvajal had met prior to the wedding. Several events point to this. One is that between 1551 and 1564, Carvajal worked for the Portuguese Crown in Cape Verde as an accountant and treasurer in the slave trade. The trade involved the transportation of slaves to the New World, particularly to Santo Domingo, where Miguel Nu?ez was involved, one way or another, in that trade. It is very likely that Nu?ez and Carvajal saw each other several times during that period and that Nu?ez regarded Carvajal as a good match for Guiomar, his oldest daughter. There were other opportunities for an earlier meeting. One might have been when Duarte de Le?n brought his nephew, Luis, to Lisbon. At that time, Miguel Nunez lived there and, being in the same trade as de Le?n, it is poss ible that he met young Carvajal then. Finally, as implied in a previous note, it is possible that he and Luis de Carvajal were related to one another. Let us now return to Guiomar and examine the accusation that she was a Judaizer. As stated before, the only evidence for that accusation comes from the statements made by Carvajal's niece Isabel and nephew Luis, who so stated under threat of torture. But as Isabel later said, she made some accusations to help her own case, knowing that "no harm could then come to them" because they were dead. We must, at least, cast some doubt about what she and her brother said regarding Guiomar. Also mentioned to support the same claim is Isabel's statement that Guiomar refused to go to the New World because Carvajal was a good Christian. But, once more, there is no evidence for this claim. In fact, evidence to the grandmother. If so, Carvajal and his wife Guiomar were related. The basis for this possibility stems from Miguel's surname, which often occurs in the V?zquez-Carvajal family, and the recurring appear ance, over several generations, of the name Isabel Nu?ez on both the V?zquez-Carvajal and Le?n Nu?ez families. 64. Elias Lipiner, Os Baptizados em Pie (Lisbon: Vega, 1998), 282. 98</page><page sequence="21">Luis de Carvajal and His People contrary exists. For example, we know that Isabel recanted her testimony that Guiomar had told her to approach her uncle once they were in the New World, saying that it was through her parents that she had heard Guiomar's request?possibly another lie. However, the fact that Guiomar stayed in Spain while her husband went to New Spain as the governor of Nuevo Reino de Leon does seem to support Isabel's contention. There are, however, other reasons that may explain Guiomar's actions. One is that there was nothing unusual in her having stayed behind. In fact, most Spaniards who went there in the sixteenth century did so without their wives. Another possibility is that Guiomar remained behind to help run the business of her father, who had died a few months before Carvajal departed. It is also possible that personal, as opposed to religious, reasons may explain her staying behind. For example, it is clear that her marriage to Carvajal was not a close one. For one thing, in the two years after the wedding, he was a shipmaster, engaged in the transportation of wheat around the Mediterranean, which meant he spent little time with her. And then, in 1567, he went to New Spain without his wife, living there for ten years. Even niece Isabel retorted that her uncle "never had much of a life" with his wife. In fact, the relationship between Carvajal and Guiomar and her siblings must have been quite strained because in 1584, when Guiomar died, her brother ?u?o did not notify Carvajal of her death but instead sent a letter to Francisco Rodriguez, Carvajal's brother in-law. Incidentally, at the time of her death, Guiomar was about thirty-three years old. This raises the possibility that her poor health was a factor in her staying in Spain. Let us now, finally, address the question of whether she was a crypto-Jew. As we have pointed out, the evidence for that possibility is lacking. Evidence to the contrary is also lacking. The only firsthand information known to us that touches the point exists in a document65 written in February 1580, soon after Guiomar's father died. In that document, Guiomar and her siblings appear, together with Carvajal, before a notary public to name Blanca Rodriguez, Miguel Nunez's widow, as the administrator of his estate. For that purpose, Guiomar had to swear to obey the terms of the contract, which she does by saying, I swear and promise this for God and for Saint Mary, and for the sign of the Cross, which I make with the fingers of my hand. Of course, such fervor does not prove she was a sincere Christian. Nevertheless, the statement is the only piece of hard evidence we have that points in either direc tion. As such, it carries far more weight than the hearsay evidence provided by the children of Francisca de Carvajal. 65. AHP, Protocolos, 14288, Escriban?a de Juan Bernal de Heredia.

Those events occurred during a short period in the sixteenth century but had a strong influence on the development of large portions of present-day northeast Mexico and the American Southwest. Among the topics we have considered here are his family background, his upbringing, the people he brought to the New World, his religion, and his wife, all of which have been pre viously treated mainly on the basis of Inquisition documents. For this work, we have used previously unknown documents that add new and important infor mation about this influential man. On the basis of such documents, we have shown that all of the charges that were leveled against Luis de Carvajal by the Inquisition and by some modern historians are false. Although he was a descen dant of New Christians, he did not know about it because he had been brought up in the house of a Spanish nobleman. In fact, Luis de Carvajal was a sincere Christian throughout his life. Nevertheless, he unknowingly brought a large number of crypto-Jews to the New World. This large group of people settled in regions of New Spain where no Europeans lived at the time and, consequently, made a strong impact on the demographic and cultural development of those regions.
