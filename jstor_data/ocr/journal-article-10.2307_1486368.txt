<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ADVANTAGE TO PECULIARITY? THE CASE OF THE POLISH COMMONWEALTH by GERSHON HUNDERT The investigation of the history of the Jews in the Polish Common- wealth requires not only research on specific topics but broader reflection as well. The special place and role of the Jews in Polish society and the dis- tinguishing characteristics of the Jewish experience in Poland need to be rescued from unwarranted generalizations which may result in misrepre- sentation.' On the broadest level, this essay is an initial step in the direction of the development of a conceptual framework for the study of this subject. The particular concern will be to compare some aspects of the experience of the Jews with that of some of the other non-Polish nonautochthonous groups in Poland from around 1500 to the beginning of the eighteenth century. A framework for discussion is provided by the largely sociological litera- NOTE: Research for this article has been supported by the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and the Canada Council.

These theories tend to stress the positive economic consequences of minority status. They are worthy of considera- tion here because, like the Jews, the Italians, Scots and Armenians in Poland were substantially involved in commerce. Testing the applicability of these theories to the Jews and to the other groups in the Polish Commonwealth will provide an opportunity to illustrate the dangers of generalization, to stress the particular bearing on Jewish history of the plural or multiethnic character of Polish society, and to single out on this basis some of the dis- tinctive problems and characteristics of the Jewish experience in Poland.2 The literature on the relationship between the Jews and commercial activity has followed two streams. One is concerned with the question of whether Jewish religious and cultural values predispose Jews toward com- mercial activities and include a system of psychological rewards for com- mercial success. Werner Sombart's thesis that the rise of modern capitalism was influenced decisively by the Jews, even more than by the Calvinist Puri- tans studied by Max Weber, is well known, and its premises continue to be debated.3 This dimension of the problem will be reviewed below.

Thus, the aristocracy controls the real estate, and agricul- tural work is performed by the native peasantry, leaving commerce to the alien minority. They are middlemen, confined to the area between producer and consumer, owner and tenant, etc.5 The "penalized minority" theory stresses the minority group's response to the hostility of the host society. Popular animus engenders or preserves solidarity and organization in addi- tion to motivating members of the group to work hard within the narrow economic realm left open to them. This is the thrust, for example, of Warren Scoville's explanation of Huguenot commercial success in France. Others, however, have suggested that the persistence of ethnic attachments is not so much a consequence of penalization but is due rather to continuing eco- nomic advantage. That is to say, the bonds of trust between members of the same group are of decisive importance in trade relations, and this explains the "failure" of members of "trading diasporas" to assimilate. Thus, mem- bers of groups scattered in various countries would tend to preserve their distinctiveness in order to maintain their special ties to members of the same group in other lands.6 Finally, some have noted that the occupational "Economic Attitudes and Behavior in the Jewish Tradition: An Examination of Sombart's Thesis in the Light of Musar Literature and Memoirs" [Hebrew], Zion 43 (1978): 235-63. 4.

This is explained on the basis of the group's self-conception as "sojourners." Since they see their stay as temporary, they are motivated to remain endogamous and to preserve their culture and religion and language by institutional means and by various forms of self-segregation.7 Although, to be sure, there are numerous variations on the themes brief- ly noted here, these are the basic modes of explanation which are used to account for the economic success of groups such as the Jews, Armenians, Chinese, and others. In each of these theoretical frameworks certain traits of the minority group are emphasized. These include the preservation of lan- guage, culture and religion, all of which foster the links between members of the group, and the development of institutions which preserve these ties. The maintenance of distinctiveness in these ways is seen as a key to the group's commercial success. At first glance it may seem that these theoretical frame- works could be applied to the historical situation of the Jews in the Polish Commonwealth, but it is necessary first to examine certain particularities of time and space. There is considerable doubt that the term "minority group" aptly describes the situation of the Jews in the Polish Commonwealth. The term generally applies only in the modern nation state where there is, presump- tively, a homogeneous citizenry. In premodern times society was character- ized by a multiplicity of loyalties and memberships; there was no majority. Local patriotism was the order of the day and there was little sense of belonging to a nation-state. It has long been noted that in premodern cor- porate society the Jews formed but one more corporation, fitting more harmoniously into the social order than they do in the modern state. To be sure, the Jews were outsiders to the extent that they rejected the universal church. How could it be otherwise when medieval theologians compared society to corpus Christi? And in certain parts of Western Europe there was sufficient linguistic and ethnic homogeneity to warrant Salo Baron's use of the term "medieval nationalism." In those areas where Jews were the only conspicuous aliens, it might be appropriate to refer to them as a minority group. Such conditions, however, did not exist in the Polish Commonwealth.8 7.

In addition to the Germans, whose legal traditions shaped the development of the Polish municipality, there were Italians, Bohemians, Dutch, Armenians, Scots, Muscovites, Greeks, French, Hungarians, Tatars, and others. Since most of these groups were concentrated like the Jews in the cities, and many of them were substantially involved in commerce, it seems singularly inappropriate to speak of the Jews as a minority at a time when less than one-fifth of the Commonwealth's population was urban, and less than forty percent of the Commonwealth's population was Polish.9 Further, the peculiar political configuration of the Polish Common- wealth must be taken into account. Conceptually and politically, Poland was coterminous with the gentry. The cities were virtually powerless, and their populations were almost devoid of a sense of belonging to the Polish nation. One could well argue that this served to inhibit the pace of assimila- tion of these groups into Polish society, and to maintain them in their own distinctive identities. The urban social landscape in the Polish Common- wealth, then, presented a multifarious picture. True, among the artisans and the poor, ethnic Poles may well have been predominant, but among the commercial classes no single group was in control. Indeed, what was distinc- tive was the relative nonparticipation of Poles in the urban commercial life of the Commonwealth. Clearly then, use of terms like "middleman minority" with reference to the Jews in Poland during the period under consideration is mistaken on two counts: they were neither a minority nor were they middlemen-at the least, they were not the only middlemen. What was the relationship between the Jews and the other members of this middle stratum in Polish society? How applicable are terms like "penalized minority" or "trading diaspora" to the Jews and these other groups? Before proceeding to attempt to answer these questions, an important distinction between the Jews and the other groups should be noted. There were far more Jews in the Polish Common- wealth than there were Scots, Italians or Armenians. Nevertheless, because these groups tended to live in the urban centers where they developed insti- tutional and occupational patterns similar to those of the Jews, comparison 9.

Each of the non-Polish groups met with legal dis- abilities and popular hostility, but were there differences in kind and form between the animus directed against the Jews and that directed against the Scots, Armenians, Italians, Tatars, and others? In legislation, at various levels, the Jews were frequently grouped with others. As early as the fifteenth century, the city of Gdarisk excluded Italians, Scots, Nurembergers and Englishmen, as well as Jews." Legislation adopted in the dietines to protect local merchants frequently identified Jews and Scots as the principal unfair competitors.12 During the seventeenth cen- tury, the guild artisans of Lublin complained about the practices of Armenian, Scottish, Jewish, and Lithuanian merchants.'3 While the statutes of the Lublin merchant guild singled out the Jews for discriminatory restric- tions, it is worth noting that in 1696 a group of Armenian merchants thought it necessary to obtain a safe-conduct from Primate Michal Rad- ziejowski. The magistrate and the merchant guild in Lublin had tried to pre- vent the Armenians from trading there.14 In Warsaw, certain Scottish mer- chants who were exempt from municipal jurisdiction reached an agreement with the municipality in 1659 according to which they would pay a fixed annual sum in return for the use of their shops on the market place. Evident- ly, though, tensions heightened, because in 1703 the shops were seized and destroyed by city authorities.'5 10.

Although popular opinion of the Italians was apparently not high in the seventeenth century,-"they are worse, even, than Jews," according to one contemporary writer-the Italians were not the objects of popular vio- lence.'6 It has been suggested that, in law, the Jews were categorized more fre- quently with Tatars and Turks than with other non-Poles.'7 This means, presumably, that the religious difference was decisive in determining the Jews' legal status. It is certainly true that religion outweighed ethnic or national factors in the common mind of the period, but even if Jews and Muslims were linked more often than Jews and Protestants, Greeks or Armenians, the issue is not of critical importance here. By the latter part of the seventeenth century, Catholicism had come to be the religion of the nobility which saw in itself the sum of the Polish Commonwealth. Even though there remained a few Protestant noblemen, they were exceptions. All burghers, and certainly non-Catholic burghers, were outside the pale of true Polishness. Indeed, the view arose in Poland during this period that "the Calvinist and Lutheran faiths signify only merchants."'8 As important as it is to point out that in form and frequency the persecu- tion of Jews in Poland was more severe than that directed against any other group, "penalization" or discrimination did not distinguish the Jews in a decisive way from other non-Poles. And, despite the fact that the Jews were more numerous than these other groups, the simple fact of ethnic hetero- genity must have served to diminish, in some measure, popular animus against the Jews in particular.19 If the term "penalized minority" is not appropriate, can the same be said of the conception of the Jews as a "trading diaspora"? Polish Jews had certainly 16. Gabriel Krasiriski (d. 1676), Taniec Rzeczypospolitey, as quoted in Zygmunt Gargas, Poglgdy ekonomiczne w Polsce XVII wieku, 2d ed. (Lw6w, 1903), p. 85.

German-Jewish families of means often sent their sons to study in the yeshivas of Poland, and sometimes learned young men were brought from Poland to act as tutors in the houses of wealthy German Jews.20 The movement of rabbis between pulpits in Ger- man territories and in Poland was considerable.21 The extensive familial and cultural ties uniting Polish and German Jews, however, should not be taken to indicate the absence of perceived differences between the two groups. If the tone of the memoirs of Gliickel of Hameln (1646-1724) is an indication of the attitude of German Jews, they felt superior to their Polish brethren.22 Nevertheless, this would not have interfered with commercial contacts. The three most important points of contact between Polish and German- Jewish merchants outside of Poland were Breslau, Leipzig, and Frankfurt (on the Oder). Breslau was the center of Silesian trade with Poland, and it has been estimated that by 1700 two-thirds of the eastward exports and imports of Silesia were in Jewish hands.23 As a group, Polish Jews com- prised just over half of the total number of Jews attending the Mitfasten Fair in Breslau in 1685.24 There, they participated in the exchange of Polish raw materials such as wax, furs, grain, wool and saltpeter for textiles, hardware and precious metals.25 Until the requisite research is done in the archives of Breslau, it will be impossible to determine the precise degree to which German and Polish Jews cooperated in this trade.

Marcin Teufel was a Breslau merchant who dealt extensively with Jews. He acted as agent for Wolf Bocian, the Cracow Jewish merchant, until his death in 1625, and subse- quently dealt with a number of other Cracow Jews.26 Ozjasz Isaakowicz of Rzesz6w, an important merchant, dealt with non-Jews in Breslau in 1674 and 1677.27 Solomon Marcus and his partner Aaron Nahman had dealings with non-Jewish merchants in Breslau.28 At times, non-Jewish merchants who were engaged in importing goods from Silesia took advantage of Jewish contacts by forming partnerships with Jews. In 1626, for instance, Pawel Achler, a Cracow merchant, in partnership with several Cracow Jews, pur- chased silver valued at 18,410 Polish zloties from a Jew in the Silesian town of Opole.29 Polish Jews also traded with non-Jewish merchants in other German trading centers. The contacts established in Frankfurt in 1624 by Solomon Bass, a Cracow Jewish merchant, were with non-Jews.30 Around 1630 the Cracow Jewish merchant, Samuel Poss, negotiated a contract with a Nuremberg merchant, Henry Helt, according to which the Jew would 26.

It should be recalled as well that German merchants, including Jews, frequently visited Poland. In 1631, Solomon and Marcus Bass were to supply Russian hides to a group of Nuremberg merchants headed by George and Julius Pestaloci at the Lub- lin fair.32 Cultural and familial ties similar to those which linked German and Polish Jews also existed between Polish Jews and those in Bohemia, Austria and, mainly during the second half of the seventeenth century, the Low Countries.33 The records of the Burial Society of the Jewish community in Lublin, which describe the disbursements of the society beginning in 1675, mention the presence in Lublin of Jews from Germany, Prague, Amsterdam, Jassy, Moravia, Italy and Turkey.34 Gdanisk, the most important commercial center in Poland, was another place where foreign Jews had contact with Jewish merchants from various Polish localities. German-Jewish traders would send their agents to the Bal- tic port to purchase goods to be imported and resold at the fairs and mar- kets of Germany.35 A "Portuguese" Jew, Samuel de Lima, formerly a resi- dent of Hamburg, arrived in Gdanisk in 1638. He was a factor of the Danish king and was accompanied by his two brothers, David and Elias (Esaias). Shortly after his arrival, Samuel obtained the privileges of a serwitor of the Polish king and was thus exempt from taxes and tolls and from all except royal jurisdiction. The de Limas remained in Gdaisk until 1654. They were involved in the export of saltpeter. In fact, the merchants of Gda6sk accused the Portuguese merchants of monopolizing that trade and of illegally giving 31. APMK, Acta Palatinalia ludaica, Varia 11, pp. 107-8, 143, 149-50.

A few years later, David de Lima was accused of smuggling (1646). Precisely at this time, objections were raised in the dietines to Jewish trade in saltpeter which was a strategic good. In that same year (1641) there was a significant increase in the amount of saltpeter exported through Gdafisk. In any case, it is clear that the de Limas had extensive dealings with Polish Jewish mer- chants who shipped goods through that port.36 Polish Jews traveled to Transylvania to trade,37 and Wallachian Jews drove oxen to and through Poland.38 There were fairly strong links with Hungary as well. Jews were active in the import of wine and copper and the export of other goods to Hungary.39 Links with Jews in the Ottoman Empire were strongest among those Polish Jews living close to the Empire's border.40 Yet these international connections gave the Jews no particular advantage over their Gentile competitors. Most of the Christian merchants who engaged in international trade enjoyed ties similar to those of the Jews. One has only to think of the Italian importers of Cracow and Lublin who enjoyed links not only to their native cities, but also to Italian merchants in German commercial centers.4 There were numerous instances of German merchants moving to Polish towns where they benefited from analogous 36.

And the case is similar with regard to Armenians and Greeks in the southeast of Poland. Although it is true that unlike the Jews the other groups were eventually assimilated, during the period in question here many merchants in Poland, and certainly not only the Jews, enjoyed the benefit of international links based on ethnic affinity.42 If the Jews enjoyed no particular advantage as a result of international ties, was there something in the contemporary Jewish ethos which gave them deeper motivation to succeed than their competitors? In some measure, this question has been examined by H. H. Ben-Sasson. His conclusion, tenta- tively offered, was based on an analysis of the writings of the rabbis of the period. After saying that there is insufficient material for a true comparison between the Puritans described by Max Weber and the Jews of Poland, Ben- Sasson wrote that although there was no explicit reference in the sources to an ethos of man having the duty to increase his wealth, certain of the writ- ings of the period imply the existence of a feeling close to this ethos. "Clearly what Weber says about the power of religious teaching to encourage eco- nomic activity by endorsing it and assuring a 'psychological reward' for its pursuit is true also for the Jews .... It would appear that the psychological reward of certitudo salutis was given also to wealthy [Jews] in the teach- ings . . ." of contemporary rabbis.43 On the other hand, Jacob Katz has come to the opposite conclusion. "Nothing short of a complete inversion of Jewish values," he wrote, "would have won direct religious sanction for economic activities."44 This issue is as yet unresolved. Religious teachings may or may not have contributed to the commercial success of the Jews in more or less the same way that they did or did not contribute to the success of the Calvinist Scots in Poland. And the cultural heritage of the Catholic Italian merchants in Poland certainly included a long history of positive evaluation of commer- cial activity. In the area of communal organization as well, the Jews were not to be distinguished from the Scots, Italians or Armenians. The Italians in Cracow organized a fraternity or brotherhood, erected their own chapel and formed partnerships only amongst themselves. The records of the fraternity were 42.

A distinction can be made though with respect to the applicability of the term "sojourners" to the Jews and to the other groups. Unlike the Jews, the Italians and the Scots carried with them the potential for return to their native countries from the day they entered Poland. It is striking that, even after considerable time in Poland, Scots continued to bequeath legacies to universities and churches in Scotland.48 If these groups did see themselves as sojourners, this may have inhibited the pace of their assimilation, but it cer- tainly did not prevent their eventual integration. In the case of the Jews, however, the use of the "sojourners" is inappropriate. Both the Poles and the Jews viewed their residence in Poland-Lithuania not only as a per- manent state but as a protected and, indeed, a privileged one as well. A seventeenth century bit of doggerel, moreover, bestowed the title, rajem dia iyd6w, "paradise for Jews," on Poland.49 This is an important historical datum insofar as it reflects popular urban attitudes and beliefs about the Jews in Poland during that period. The anonymous author of the expression was animated by attitudes similar to those of Jan Dlugosz (1415-1480) when, two centuries earlier, he recorded the famous legend of Casimir the Great's Jewish mistress, Esterka. She used her feminine wiles to persuade the fourteenth century monarch to grant the Jews their privileges, and by her the king had four children, two boys and two girls. The boys were raised as Christians, the girls as Jews.50 Aside from what is evidently a desire to cast aspersions on the legitimacy of the Jews' privileges, there is the 45.

Similar views can be found reflected in certain well-known Jewish sources as well. For example, there is the division of the Hebrew word for Poland, Polin, into its constituent parts, po-here, and lin-dwell, and its interpretation as a kind of divine injunction for the Jews to dwell in Poland. There was even a kabbalistic author in Wilno at the end of the seventeenth century who composed a tract establishing that the Messiah would come first to Poland. In addition to these rather literary examples it will be useful also to look at three illustrations drawn from the actual experience of the Jews in the Polish Commonwealth.5' Salo Baron has remarked that "Jews residing in Cracow or Grodno, in Brest or Kalisz continued living in the old Ashkenazic way-dwelling in quarters of their own.""52 This is true of the larger towns where the areas of Jewish residence were fairly strictly defined. Even in a smaller place like Opat6w, an inventory carried out in 1721 was divided into two sections, first the Catholic town and then the Jewish one. This survey showed that only six houses owned by Jews, of a total of 110, were outside the Jewish town and that not one Christian lived on a Jewish street.53 In other small towns, however, the separation between areas of Jewish and Christian residence was not so marked. In Opole (Lubelski), Beliyce, and Lubart6w, the towns' records of property transfers reveal that, particu- larly during the first half of the seventeenth century, Jews and Catholics lived interspersed.54 Although there were particular streets where Jews tended to live, it was not unusual, for example, for a Christian to live next to 51.

Nine of these were on the Jewish street (Ulica Zydowska) where there were three other houses inhabited by Christians, while ten were on the marketplace (rynek) or on Lublin street where the majority of houses belonged to Christians.56 The 1688 inventory of Opole showed that most Jews lived on the rynek (fifteen houses) where there was an almost equivalent number of houses owned by non-Jews (thir- teen)." The register of Modliborzyce of 1735 similarly showed that most of the Jews there lived among the non-Jews on the rynek.58 In Kranik, the wealthiest Jewish merchants and arendators lived on the street with the fewest Jews.59 Similarly, in Beliyce some of the most prominent Jews owned houses next to Christians.60 In Opole in 1622 a qahal elder bought a home on the rynek between two non-Jews.6' The contention in the matter of where Jews lived is not that the general tendency was for them to buy houses next to the non-Jews, for this would be contrary to fact, but rather that the Jewish community was less insular, physically, than might be supposed. It was not uncommon for Jews to live on a variety of streets in the towns, and in small towns Jews were much more likely to live interspersed among Christians. In those smaller centers, Jews were often the only commercial element, and this dominance of commercial life, along with their often close ties to the town-owner, must have led to their holding a rather high status in the town; at least the merchants among the Jews became a kind of patriciate. In the larger cities residential segrega- tion tended to be stricter, competition more intense, and animosities more dangerous. This is not to say that close or easy relations between Jews and Christians occurred only in small towns, but that, from the point of view of 55. WAPL, Ks. m. Opola 9, 147, 178-79; Ks. m.

Such studies ought to attend to the question of economic competition between Jews and Christians in smaller towns as well. To date, studies of the situation in Cracow, Lw6w, Poznani, and the like have produced a picture of fierce economic competition with increasing limitations being placed in the path of the Jews. In smaller towns the situation may well have been dif- ferent. The same inventory of Opat6w, mentioned earlier, shows what appears to have been a more or less complementary relationship between Jews and Christians in terms of their occupations. All the shoemakers were Chris- tians, all the capmakers were Jews. All of the weavers were non-Jews, all the clothiers and haberdashers were Jews. The areas of competition included baking, butchering and tailoring. Here the religious requirements of the Jews precluded their reliance on Christians. The Jews almost completely dominated the commercial life of the town, and its wealthiest citizens pre- sumably came from their ranks. Three non-Jews were listed as merchants, and they were all very likely Scots. This, too, was characteristic of the age; commerce was largely in the hands of a variety of groups not ethnically Polish in origin.62 The third illustrative point relates to the measure of the distance between the Jews and the rest of society in the Polish Commonwealth. Various scho- lars have posited that Polish Jewry formed "a world apart," virtually untouched culturally and socially by the larger trends in Polish society until at least the second half of the eighteenth century. This widespread presup- position has had as its effect the almost complete absence of comparative studies of Jews and other segments of Polish society in virtually every area, from architecture to styles of preaching, from occupational distribution to modes of dress, from communal organization to attitudes to change and to authority. All of these areas deserve systematic study. One brief, almost banal, illustration of the permeability of Jewish society in the seventeenth century will have to suffice here. About five years ago an article entitled "The Sarmatization of the Polish Bourgeoisie in the Seventeenth Century" appeared in A cta Poloniae His- torica.63 On the basis of somewhat impressionistic evidence the author sug- 62.

There is evidence, at this point equally impressionistic, that nobility cultural styles held the same attraction for certain Jews. Sebastian Miczynski vented his wrath early in the seventeenth century against a certain Lewek Moszkowicz of Cracow who traveled "like a gentry- man (szlachcic)" with a pair of footmen.64 There were complaints in Droho- bycz in 1661 against a certain Aaron Izaakowicz who, Christian residents complained to the surveyor, had trained four footmen to serve him. Izaak- owicz replied that he had only two footmen.65 At the end of the century, the Cracow elder and officer of the Council of Four Lands, Zacharjasz Mendel Kantorowicz, had an armed retinue in his employ.66 Sermons of the period attacked Jews for dressing like Gentiles, teaching their children Gentile lan- guages, gambling and drinking with them, and the like.67 All this is not to mention the episodes of intellectual intercourse, especially between Jews and Protestants, in the sixteenth century.68 The point is not that the Jews were an integral part of some imaginary cultural unity called Poland. No such unit existed during the period under examination here. Conceptually, Poland was virtually coextensive with the nobility. The values of the Polish-Jewish community were, overwhelmingly, peculiar to the Jews, the product of their own historical experience. However, whatever the precise measure of the influence of the Polish envi- ronment on the Jews was, there is no evidence to suggest that they regarded their residence there as anything other than permanent, barring the miracu- lous appearance of the messiah.69 64.

If</page><page sequence="18">38 GERSHON HUNDERT These reflections have raised more questions than they have answered, and the issues which framed the discussion suggest some new and produc- tive lines of inquiry. The Jews of the Polish Commonwealth were one of a number of non-Polish nonautochthonous groups. Many of these groups, such as the Italians, Scots, and Armenians were similar to the Jews in their mainly commercial occupations, their communal organizations, their legal status, and in the attitudes adopted toward them by the Poles. Clearly, any study of these dimensions of the Jewish experience in the Polish Common- wealth must be carried out against this background. The Council of Four Lands was the product, partly, of the same historical conditions which pro- duced the Chief Scots' Diet; the anti-Jewish enactments of artisan guilds usually included similar clauses about other non-Polish groups; laws which discriminated against Jews frequently grouped them with others. Once again-and not surprisingly-one finally arrives at the almost banal com- monplace that the Jews cannot be studied in isolation. Department of History McGill University Montreal, PQ, Canada, H3A 2T7 Sabbatianism had had a significant impact on the largest community in the diaspora, there would almost certainly be more evidence than the few sources cited and disputed by Weinryb, The Jews, pp. 220-35. Jacob Frank's inspiration came in Salonica. In any case there is serious doubt as to whether Frankism ought to be seen as a messianic movement or as a group of "anarchist" cells with charismatic leadership born in the social and religious turmoil of the period of transition between medieval and modern times. If messianic movements are an index of "sojourning," the absence of such movements among the Jews of the Polish Commonwealth is still another indication that they did not see themselves as sojourners. For now, see the remarks of Gerson Cohen on Ashkenazic Jews in general in his "Messianic Postures of Ash- kenazim and Sephardim," Leo Baeck Memorial Lecture 9 (New York, 1967).</page></plain_text>
