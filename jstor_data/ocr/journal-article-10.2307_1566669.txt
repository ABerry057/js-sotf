<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonathan Frankel. The Damascus Affair: "Ritual Murder, " Politics, and the Jews in 1840. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. xv, 491 pp. Jonathan Frankel's fascinating, multifaceted account of the Damascus affair of 1840 is a model of empirical research and reasoned analysis. It should stand as the definitive work on the subject for years to come. In producing this remarkably comprehensive study, Frankel consulted diplomatic archives in England, France, the United States, and Austria, as well as memoirs, correspondence, newspapers from across Europe, including the Jewish press, ideological tracts, and both Jewish and non-Jewish historiography. The book that resulted from this long-term project operates on a number of levels. It is a probing investigation into modem European diplomacy (and imperialism) in the Middle East, an account of Jewish "interest" politics in Emancipation-era Europe, and an analysis of the transmutations of medieval prejudice in post-Enlightenment culture. The Damascus ritual murder accusation surfaced in the wake of the disappearance (and presumed murder) of Father Thomas, an Italian-born monk of the (French) Capuchin order, together with his assistant, Ibrahim Amara. In the city's Christian community, news spread quickly of a "ritual murder" perpetrated by Jews, but in the normal course of events this "culturally specific" construction of a criminal event would not likely have been tolerated-let alone encouraged-in the Ottoman empire. Two factors impinged upon the Ottoman authorities to wrest control of the situation from their hands and, ultimately, to shift the center of gravity of the Damascus affair from Asia to Europe. The first was the Franko- Turkish treaty of 1740, which awarded French diplomatic agents the right to protect Roman Catholic clergy in the Ottoman lands. The second complicating factor consisted of the fact that at the time the empire had essentially been divided into two parts, and the sultan was not able to exert political control over greater Syria.</page><page sequence="2">138 BOOK REVIEWS This territory fell under the control of the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammed Ali, who had conquered it in the preceding decade; the government of France, in turn, worked to stabilize Ali's rule with an eye to increasing its own influence in the region. What these circumstances meant at the local level was that the French consul in Damascus, Count de Ratti-Menton, and the governor-general of Syria, SherifPasha, would team up to investigate and prosecute the apparent murder. Scores of people were arrested and brought to Sherif Pasha for questioning; interrogation under torture was the preferred method of inquiry. In the end, sixteen Jewish men stood accused of the murder of Father Thomas and his servant. Four Jews died as the direct result of tortures inflicted in the course of their interrogations. One converted to Islam. Whether predisposed or not to the theory of a Jewish ritual murder, Ratti- Menton came to be a passionate advocate of such an understanding of events and zealously prosecuted the case as a ritual murder. At the level of international relations, the contest among the European powers for influence in the Middle East rendered Adolphe Thiers, the premier of France, Clemens von Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, and Lord Palmerston, foreign secretary of Great Britain, actors in an otherwise obscure case of communal conflict between Christians and Jews in a sleepy Middle Eastern city. Thiers, head of the government of the first country in Europe formally to emancipate its Jewish population, chose to dismiss the pleas of French Jewish dignitaries and support his consul in Damascus. Palmerston and Metternich, for their part, condemned the police investigation and trial as miscarriages of justice and the accusation itself as irrational. Their long-term goal was to effect the retreat of Muhammed Ali from greater Syria and the return of direct Ottoman rule. A well-publicized "Jewish" mission to the East, led by Moses Montefiore of England and Adolphe Cremieux of France (two headstrong personalities who fairly despised each other), produced modest results in the summer of 1840; it was only in late August, with British and Austrian warships cruising off the coast of Alexandria, that the Egyptian viceroy announced the release of the surviving prisoners. He refused Cr6mieux and Montefiore's request for a firman declaring the ritual murder charge to be "libelous and without foundation," although Montefiore eventually did obtain such a statement, from the sultan himself, following an audience on the 28h of October.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 139 Frankel situates the Damascus affair within the larger phenomenon of episodic crisis, "one of the many sudden attacks that from time to time broke in upon the otherwise relatively regular life of the Jews" (p. 1). Such crises might serve as counterpoints to the basic themes of nineteenth-century Jewish history-typically organized around the process of emancipation-presenting moments of "sudden discontinuity" at a time when "long-term patterns of development were steadily transforming traditional ways of life" (p. 1). It is in analyzing such moments of crisis, Frankel suggests, that one can ascertain such variables as the extent of solidarity among Jews, the political means they had at their disposal, the degree of their influence on policies of state, their standing in public opinion, and their own- often conflicting-aspirations. Additionally, he structures the narrative sections of the book through a set of questions that include the following: Was there a conspiratorial force planning and coordinating the ritual murder cases? If not, how are they to be explained? What role was played by the European powers and their consuls? Along what lines did the press and public opinion divide in Europe? Finally, what responses did the Jews of Europe offer to the renewed dissemination of the ritual murder accusation, and to what effect? Frankel rejects the notion that a conspiracy of some kind propelled the case against the Jews of Damascus. This is not to say that the case was not, in a very real sense, "manufactured," but only that there was no coordination behind the scenes. Rather, what tipped the scales, what kept pushing the government investigation along (even after it had run out of enthusiasm) was pressure from-of all places- the French consulate. Count de Ratti-Menton relentlessly demanded results, and SherifPasha, the governor general, "made sure that results were produced" (p. 51). This is not a new interpretation. Even contemporary Jewish reportage identified Ratti-Menton as the chief villain in the affair. What Frankel adds is an analysis that refuses the solace that comes from a one-sided or triumphalist reading of any kind. True enough, Ratti-Menton's intervention in the case worked to the detriment of the Damascus Jewish defendants. But his was hardly a lone voice. During the month of February, the entire Christian community of Damascus-ranging from the indigenous population of Maronites, Greeks, and Armenians, to the religious orders, to the small population of European businessmen and diplomats (a number of whom were Protestant)-supported the ritual murder charge against the Jews. Thereafter the French government itself refused to challenge, or even to question, the actions</page><page sequence="4">140 BOOK REVIEWS of its consul in Syria, practicing at times a studied neutrality, or "agnosticism," on the theoretical possibility of Jewish ritual murder, and at times warning French Jewish representatives to cease complaining about the matter, lest the truth about their coreligionists be revealed. At the same time that the French premier was acting in Paris to keep the Damascus case alive, the Times of London-arguably the most prestigious newspaper in the world-promoted a similar course of action. Unique among British papers in the extensive coverage it devoted to events in Damascus, the Times editorial writers took the position in the summer of 1840 that "the guilt or innocence of the Jews, the truth or falsehood of the ritual-murder charge," had to be treated as open questions (p. 207). While awaiting the verdict of the jury of opinion, the Times published prodigious amounts of material on various aspects of the affair in Damascus as well as on the ritual murder accusation in general, determined, "in the interests of objectivity," to give equal space to both "sides" of the argument. The newspaper went so far in its pursuit of "objectivity" as to translate a Romanian tract from 1803, which it reproduced in its June 25 edition under the headline: "A mystery, hitherto concealed and now published for the first time, concerning the Hebrews, the blood that they take from Christians, and the use that they make of it, with proofs from the Holy Scriptures." The behavior of such representatives of Western liberalism as Thiers, Ratti- Menton, and the Times underlines a central paradox at the heart of the Damascus affair. As Frankel explains, to the extent that traditional politics and traditional structures of authority were allowed to express themselves, they generally intervened in such a way as to silence, or delegitimize, the accusation of Jewish ritual murder. The Ottoman sultan, the Austrian chancellor, the head of the Vienna branch of the Rothschild banking family (who assumed the role of shtadlan in pursuing quiet, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Austrian authorities), and, eventually, the Egyptian viceroy, responded to the "event" of a ritual murder in a Middle Eastern city with an impulse to disbelieve and a determination to discredit. The same cannot be said for the forces of "modernity" and "progress." The one exception to this reversal of expectations is offered by the British foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston, who, like Metternich, reacted with derision to the suggestion that Jews performed ritual murder on Christians.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 141 The difficulty, of course, lies in explaining these counterintuitive results. Frankel's approach is to consider each case individually. Thiers's behavior appears to have been dictated by expediency; he was prepared to follow any strategy, deploy any tactic, that would promote the interests of France in this matter. And those interests, linked as they were to the stability of Muhammed Ali's regime in Syria, seemed to require solidarity with Ratti-Menton as well. In Frankel's view it is impossible to say whether or not Thiers in fact believed it when he suggested to James de Rothschild that, in the Middle Ages at least, the Jews were fanatical enough to have required Christian blood for Passover. The important point is that Thiers chose purposefully to make the statement, as a tactic designed to put his Jewish critics off balance. As to the behavior of the Times, Frankel offers a number of possibilities: the opposition of many Tories to the emancipation of the Jews, the paper's hostility to Palmerston and consequent sympathy for France, the desire to exploit the "sales value" of a sensational story, and the decision (as Frankel puts it, in language that unfortunately lacks precision) to "give some adequate outlet to undercurrents of opinion otherwise hidden from sight" (p. 207). The length of the list hints at the difficulty in choosing a plausible motive. Frankel rarely offers an explanation that strikes him as hypothetical. Staying close to his sources, he deploys an empiricism that is both a strength and a weakness of the book. He may be at pains to explain exactly why the Times chose to pursue the type of coverage that it did, but he does light upon a crucial observation: this type ofj ournalism served as a precursor to (if not a precedent for) a type of liberal, post-Enlightenment intervention in modem ritual murder discourse that actually promoted, rather than attacked, the conceptual viability of the accusation. What conclusions are to be drawn from the event as a whole? In Frankel's view, his findings both confirm and undermine the conventional liberal interpretation of the Damascus affair (as formulated, for example, by Heinrich Graetz) as a "double triumph" that in the end strengthened the bonds that united Jews around the world even as it gave the lie, once and for all, to the accusation of Jewish ritual murder. It is undeniable, Frankel argues, that Jews across Central and Western Europe mobilized to meet the challenge and achieved a remarkable degree of political coordination. But it is equally apparent that Jewish dignitaries like Montefiore and Cr6mieux failed to achieve one of their principle objectives: to have the verdicts of ritual murder "formally and conclusively disproved" (p. 433). In fact,</page><page sequence="6">142 BOOK REVIEWS Frankel concludes, it is doubtful that Western opinion did, in fact, rally to the side of the Jews either during or because of the Damascus affair. As he puts it, the "epicenter" of the event quickly shifted from the Middle East to Europe, where Jews found themselves-unexpectedly-to be on the political and rhetorical defensive. A particular form of social knowledge about Jews, which in the past had been branded as superstition by liberal discourse, had "come back to haunt," endangering the public standing of Jews in European societies, "their civil rights (existing or prospective), and even their physical safety" (p. 439). The historical significance of the Damascus affair, then, ultimately lies in its power to undermine expectations (both ours and those of the affair's contemporaries) concerning modernity. The past imposed itself on the future; myth and received wisdom overtook rationality; "reactionary" regimes defended the rights and social standing of Jews; "progressive" states and organs of opinion offered no comfort. To begin to explain why this should have been so would, I think, require more analysis of the cultural underpinnings of the discourse of Jewish ritual murder at mid-century than Frankel is willing to engage in. His one chapter entitled "Between Historiography and Myth" does provide a foray into the fascinating question concerning the plausibility-indeed, the attractiveness--ofthis cultural construct among European elites, but it stands alone and somewhat disconnected from the book's other narrative and thematic sections. Yet, it seems to me, it is precisely issues concerning rhetorical structures, elite and popular opinion, scholarship, and myth that one needs to juxtapose to claims about cynical pragmatism and raison d'dtat if one is to explain the perplexing behavior of the "progressives" in this curious affair. This is the one quality that Frankel's excellent study lacks: a satisfying blending of political and cultural analysis. On all other levels, the work remains a model of historical scholarship.
