Leuven: Peeters, 1997. 754 pp. This book will be a useful addition to the bookshelves of scholars who are accustomed to consulting Brockelmann's Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der semitischen Sprachen' or Moscati's Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages.2 It comprehends a much broader range of topics and vastly 1.

Lipifiski has accomplished an astounding feat of one-man scholarship. However, Moscati understood forty years ago that no one scholar could adequately survey, evaluate, and synthesize all of the information single-handedly, and so he brought in some of the leading specialists in the main branches of the Semitic family as collaborators. The body of knowledge and thinking about Semitic languages and their Afro-Asiatic relatives has grown tremendously in the intervening years, and Lipifiski would have done well to follow Moscati's model. Moreover, he should have heeded the desiderata that Moscati set before himself, that the book "must concentrate upon the essential facts while mentioning various particular questions of special importance; it must avoid doubtful and disputed hypotheses while indicating certain of the lines of research being pursued and certain more important divergences of opinion, so as to give an adequate notion ofpresent-day scientific trends" (p. 1). Lipifiski has neglected every clause of these recommendations. The book consists of five chapters: "Semitic Languages" (classification and dating, with a section on "Language and Script"), "Phonology," "Morphology," "Syntax," "Lexicon." There is also a glossary of linguistic terminology, an extensive bibliography divided by the major language groups, plus "Languages in Contact" and "Anthroponomy and Toponymy," an index of topics, and indices of words and forms. The book is beautifully printed, with few typographical errors or flaws in English idiom. There are also some fine photographic reproductions of Semitic inscriptions and documents. Comparative grammar since the nineteenth century has built its logical coherence on the notion of reconstruction and the distinction between those kinds of language change which are "regular," meaning exceptionless, and those which are more idiosyncratic. The heuristic heart of the comparative method is the construction of hypotheses about historical events: one reconstructed or attested 6tat de langue succeeding another through specific changes; relative sequence is everything. It is not enough simply to amass facts and "compare grammars." Unfortunately, the notion of specifying hypotheses that can be tested as to coherence and consistency is absent from this book. Lipifiski offers many speculative, ad-hoc explanations and hypothetical primeval structures, but often it is impossible to tell at what chronological stage such structures are claimed to have existed. He is more interested in identifying "original" structures, which in most</page><page sequence="3">106 BOOK REVIEWS cases we must identify with proto-Afro-Asiatic, than in characterizing proto-Semitic (or any definable subsequent stage); in any case these two stages are not consistently and explicitly distinguished. It would be difficult to learn from this book what criteria to use in deciding whether a newly discovered text is Hebrew/Canaanite or Aramaic or something else, or what the issues of disagreement are between those who put Arabic in the South Semitic branch along with Ethiopic and those who group Arabic together with Hebrew and Aramaic as Central Semitic (which Lipiniski confusingly labels "West Semitic"). These are exactly the kinds of distinctions and criteria that should be central to an "outline of a comparative grammar." In a strict sense this book is not a comparative grammar at all. It is preoccupied with explanation at the expense of system, but without the system it is impossible to see how the explanations may be evaluated. The discussion of gender devotes almost as much space to the unproven suffixes which some scholars have isolated in semantically associated words (such as -b in terms for wild animals like 'arnab 'rabbit') as it does to the familiar -t that marks feminines in all the older Semitic languages and most of the modem ones, though there is much left unsaid about the distribution and function of the -t. If the putative suffixes of the former sort were ever productive (which seems unlikely), it was long before the proto-Semitic stage. Their functionality could be demonstrated only by evidence from the Afro-Asiatic branches other than Semitic. The same is true of the argument that the case system originally consisted of a two-way distinction of"ergative" versus "predicative." The fact that Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Classical Arabic coincide in having a three-way system of nominative -u, accusative -a, genitive -i proves beyond debate that the same was true in proto- Semitic. The putative binary ergative system could have existed only in the early Afro-Asiatic period, long before there was such a thing as a Semitic language. On the other hand, the book fails to distinguish data adduced as evidence of prehistoric stages of language from examples that are patently innovative. In a discussion of the original forms of the numerals "one" and "two," the cited forms from various modem Ethiopian languages are as pointless and distracting as is the mention of the North African Arabic lul, which is from Old Arabic zawj "pair," a loanword from Greek. Though the preface describes this book as an introductory textbook, for that purpose it is wholly inappropriate. It is a huge mine of information, but so many of the ideas are unreliable that it is best reserved as a resource for specialists who can</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 107 evaluate them critically (and they will regret the author's decision to omit source references).
