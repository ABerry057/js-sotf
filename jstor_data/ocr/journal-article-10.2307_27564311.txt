Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2005. 190 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000724 Written with great conciseness and clarity, David Fishman's collection of essays, a number of which have been published previously and substantively revised, represents a valuable contribution to the growing body of literature about Yiddish in its east European context. It focuses on the Russian Empire and interwar Poland to explore related themes in the rise and fall of secular Yiddish culture between the second half of the nineteenth century and the Holo caust. Fishman writes with great reverence for his subject, noting that he was inspired by the efforts of the poet Abraham Sutzkever and others who risked their lives in Nazi-occupied Vilna by smuggling books, documents, and other arti facts to preserve the eastern European Jewish cultural heritage for posterity?the subject of the book's final chapter. Fishman understands modem Yiddish culture as not merely belle lettres. Rather, his definition includes the entirety of creative output in the language. In particular, he is interested in institutions and organs of mass culture developed in the language as part and parcel of Jews' modernization along general eastern European lines: political parties, the press and periodicals, publishing houses and libraries, theaters, literary and cultural organizations, in addition to schools and academies (in the eyes of many Yiddishists, the pinnacle of cultural achieve ment). He pays great attention to the intersection of language and politics, concen trating on the development of Yiddishism as a cultural ideology fusing national romantic and populist impulses and its relationship to forms of Jewish nationalism and socialism. He emphasizes that despite popular misconceptions that see it as a proletarian-based and socialist-oriented movement, Yiddishism was embraced by a large part of the Jewish intelligentsia in the tsarist empire by 1905 and cut across the political and economic spectrum. Fishman is careful to point out that most Jews were hardly Yiddishists, even if they were most certainly Yiddish speakers; conversely, many Yiddishists, as was typical among the progenitors of European nationalist movements, did not start out as speakers of the exalted mother tongue. Just as modem Yiddish culture would not have been possible without the "return" of Europeanized intellectuals seeking to rouse the national consciousness of the people and win it political and 401</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews cultural rights, it also could not have existed without large and appreciative audiences sufficiently modernized (but not comfortable enough in Hebrew or non-Jewish languages) to desire to have their increasingly nontraditional cultural needs satisfied in their mother tongue. The existence of this body of consumers was itself an impetus for the Jewish intelligentsia, including a number of enterpris ing journalists, to reevaluate its attitude toward a language typically denigrated since the Haskalah. Without a stable economic base, which was possible for the first time with the legalization of the daily press and theater in Yiddish in the wake of the 1905 revolution, modem Yiddish culture could never have taken root in Russia and its differentiation into high and low cultural spheres could not have occurred. But this economic base was inadequate for other areas, making idealistic Yiddish scholars, educators, and artists who sought to "elevate" the masses dependent on fund-raising and a variety of jobs to make ends meet and to finance their endeavors in the competitive cultural marketplace. The author is eager to deradicalize the historiography of Yiddish culture. Among his goals is to correct what he sees as the common myth promoted by the Bund that it deserves the lion's share of the credit for modem Yiddish culture. Fishman demonstrates that most landmark events in the history of modem Yiddish culture were not sponsored by the Bund or Bundists. Because the Bund valued literature chiefly as a means to pursue politics, it was dismissive of the works of many important Yiddish authors, including Sholem Aleichem and Sholem Asch, that did not accord with its ideology and its press was little inter ested in fiction. He points to many non-Bundists, above all Y L. Peretz, who were crucial in conceptualizing the goals of the Yiddish cultural movement and implementing them. He also devotes a chapter to Max Weinreich, no longer an active Bundist as an adult, who embodied a remarkable fusion of German scho larly and Russian populist traditions and strove to make YIVO a nonpartisan center for objective scholarship about eastern European Jewry. The Bund's contri bution, he maintains, was to champion a version of Yiddishism after 1905 that was "staunchly Marxist, secularist, and anti-Hebrew" (61). By his own admission (and somewhat weakening his thesis), however, the Bund played a leading role?more than the socialist Poale Zion or the bourgeois Folksparty and other small parties? in raising public consciousness about the dignity of Yiddish as a language. It was the first Jewish party to promote Yiddish language rights, and its members, as indi viduals, were extremely active in the secular school movement. Fishman also aims to debunk what he objects to as the widespread notion that Yiddish was championed exclusively by elements radically hostile to Zionism, Hebrew, and Jewish religious tradition. Jewish society as a whole was not polarized along linguistic lines, the much touted "language war" between extreme Hebraist and Yiddishists notwithstanding. Rather, language choice was emblematic of one's stance on broader issues facing Russian Jewry. Zionists com mitted to the continuation of Jewish life in the Diaspora (such as the general Zionist leader Yitzhak Gr?nbaum) championed the cause of Yiddish in Europe, and many Diaspora Nationalists and Territorialists held positive views of Hebrew and did not embrace Yiddish to the exception of Hebrew (or, as in histor ian Simon Dubnow's case, Russian, too). True, the Bundist-dominated Yiddish 402</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews secular schools in the former Congress Poland were typically more hostile to reli gion than the secular schools in the kresy (Poland's eastern borderlands), where active support for Jewish nationalism was more common. Nonetheless, many of these schools provided Hebrew instruction to some degree and taught children about traditional holidays (although stressing nontraditional interpretations) through literature and other means. There are a few oversights in the book. The distinction between ideological and practical support for Yiddish is not always made perfectly clear (but the lines are admittedly blurry), and more evidence could be adduced for many of his claims, especially concerning the currency of myths about Yiddish culture. Fishman's discussions of tsarist Russia have an overwhelming focus on the western provinces, where Russian, not Polish, language and culture were dominant. Passing references are made to Congress Poland without explaining how it was cul turally and legally distinct from the western provinces. The author is clearly aware of these differences, as well as of Polonization among Jews (including Peretz), as some of his later arguments are predicated on this knowledge. Similarly, he neglects to explain why the kresy were more hospitable to Yiddishism and Jewish national ism in general than central Poland in the interwar period. He points to the pogroms of the 1880s and subsequent anti-Jewish measures as a turning point that largely discredited Russification in the eyes of Jewish intellectuals (11). His chapter about language debates within the Hevrat Mefizei Haskalah (OPE) in 1905 demon strates, however, that language shift continued largely unabated for decades there after, and even proponents of this new Yiddish culture often communicated in Russian or Polish with each other into the early twentieth century. Fishman rightly points out increasing Polonization as a serious concern to Yiddishists. The overview of interwar Poland suggests, however, that each language was in absolute competition, as opposed to what Chone Shmeruk described as a "polysys tem" in which ordinary individuals, not necessarily motivated by ideology, met their cultural needs in three languages (Polish, Yiddish, and Hebrew). These minor criticisms aside, the book is illuminating and provides a spring board for the further exploration of a number of questions. Indeed, many of the topics explored within, such as Diaspora Nationalists' fascinating attempt to arrive at a nontraditional definition of who is a Jew, remain relevant today.
