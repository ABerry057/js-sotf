New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. viii, 214 pp. Emancipation is commonly viewed as the defining experience in the modem history of western and central European Jewry. Until the last two decades, the regnant theory of Jewish emancipation was patterned after the history of the Jews in Germany, where changes in the social, economic, cultural, and religious spheres were most dramatic. While there is no denying the transformative power of emancipation, recent research on the Jews of England, France, the Hapsburg Empire, and of Germany as well, has exposed the inadequacy of the German-Jewish model. Emancipation assumed a variety of expressions, depending on where and when it was granted; its effects were conditioned by local political and social forces, and by the history and composition of the Jewish population under examination. Moreover, owing to the overwhelming tendency of scholars to concentrate their attention on the activities and attitudes of Jewish communal and religious leaders, the impact of emancipation on the masses of Jews living in rural areas has been largely ignored. Paula Hyman's excellent study of nineteenth-century Alsatian Jewry thoroughly corrects the gross distortions stemming from the Germanocentric approach and the partiality to elites, while disclaiming the widespread preoc- cupation with historical discontinuities. By investigating the responses of the Jews in rural Alsace to the new conditions of the nineteenth century, Hyman challenges conventional wisdom about the pace of socioeconomic change and the specific aspects of social behavior that were transformed. Approaching emancipation as a process which occurred over the course of a century rather than as a single event in the aftermath of the French Revolution, Hyman</page><page sequence="2">226 BOOK REVIEWS casts her net widely, focusing on its long-term implications for occupational structure, the family, education, and social mobility and acculturation. The result is an outstanding achievement that illumines much more than its title would imply. At the heart of Hyman's research methodology is a comparative analysis of socioeconomic and cultural adaptation in the village and city. Marshaling evidence from a vast array of sources, ranging from local censuses, tax rolls, marriage and notarial records, and records of commercial courts to governmental reports, consistorial records, newspaper accounts, and memoir literature, she examined the modernization of the Jewish population of Strasbourg and three smaller communities, Bischeim, Niederroedern, and Itterswiller, in different areas of the Lower Rhine. This research technique permitted her to assess the relative impact of emancipation in urban and rural settings, and to clarify the role of elites in transforming the masses of Jews. Hyman's findings confirm those of Eugen Weber and Maurice Agulhon, among others, concerning the very limited impact of the Revolution in the French countryside before the last third of the nineteenth century. She not only provides the most thorough documentation of this thesis to date, using evidence culled from the experience of the Jews, but precisely because of her special focus, has also refined our understanding of the general process of modernization. Her insightful analysis of occupational classifi- cations-attentive to the limitations, yet able to provide some correlation between occupation and wealth-is accompanied by an excellent discussion of moneylending, indigence, and begging. Hyman also shows how local popular antisemitism had an impact on social and economic integration, particularly the role that allegations of Jewish usury played in shaping Jewish responses to emancipation throughout the century. According to Hyman, Jews perceived and acted on the economic opportunities of an expanding capitalist economy, resulting in a retarding of the economic assimilation envisioned by Jewish and gentile leaders. Skillfully integrating previous findings of other scholars with her own research, she has produced a solid overview of population size and distribution, and a most comprehensive picture of the social and economic profile of the region's Jews. Her main conclusion, supported amply by painstaking research, is that of continuity in the traditional role of commercial middlemen (merchant, peddler, moneylender) long after the bestowal of civic equality. Emancipation, then, offered new economic opportunities, but did not lead to a radical transformation of livelihood.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 227 Similarly, patterns of family life reveal a dogged resistance to change. Most importantly, Hyman demonstrates that Jewish culture was fashioned under determinative social and economic conditions; as long as these remained relatively stable and unchanged, Jewish culture persisted in its traditional guise. The undoing of tradition, then, was very slow in coming, and quite limited in scope. Hyman carefully guides the reader through the transformation of the social and economic framework governing the lives of Alsace's Jews by ana- lyzing the effects of general economic developments, the impact of migration and urbanization, the implementation of policies of acculturated urban leaders in Paris and Alsace, and the role of state intervention. Of these, her treatment of migration is especially strong. She shows that migration had a dual effect, initially reinforcing cultural conservatism in the communities left behind, as it removed potential agents of reform from the countryside. For those who left the villages, migration promoted acculturation and social mobility, ultimately leading to the undermining of traditional religious observance in the cities. Hyman's comparative study of Jewish migrants and non-migrants shows that the former were economically upwardly mobile, more literate, and tended to marry later. She concludes that upward social mobility preceded migration, and that it was this economic factor, not anti-Jewish hostility, that accounts for urbanization. Invariably, migration to the cities left a legacy of estrangement from Judaism. How is the progressive rupture with Jewish tradition measured? The author addresses this difficult task by assembling indicators of acculturation, including the abandonment of Jewish names, the growing identification with state symbols, the adoption of contemporary mores of aesthetics and decorum, the increasing lack of respect for, or indifference to, rabbinic authority, and increased social integration in the civic sphere. With the exception of naming patterns, which are quantitative, evidence for acculturation is more difficult to gather and any claim concerning its magnitude is even more difficult to substantiate. Hyman is particularly judicious in handling these issues. Hyman demonstrates convincingly, however, that the limits of the trans- formation of Alsatian Jewry were more imposing than the changes in their social behavior and culture. Although Jews moved progressively in the direction of higher-level commercial pursuits, occupations in artisanry and crafts never acquired status in the Jewish community of either the cities or the countryside. Her instructive comparison of Jews and non-Jews reveals</page><page sequence="4">228 BOOK REVIEWS that patterns of mobility differed substantially. Jews and non-Jews responded differently to capitalist developments in the nineteenth century largely because Jews had never been peasants. A combination of factors convinced Jews that opportunities for economic success lay with continuity, not with agriculture or artisanry. In a similar vein, the theme of continuity is unmistakable in the discussion on education as an instrument for the remaking of Alsa- tian Jewry. Supplementing earlier accounts of the modernization of Jewish schooling in France with statistical rigor, Hyman delineates the dimensions of the Jewish schooling enterprise and furnishes useful data for measuring the success of educational reformers. In a particularly original analysis of Jewish students in the lycees and colleges of Alsace, Hyman produced a valuable socioeconomic profile of families who sent their children to these schools. They were of the lower middle class, predominantly shopkeepers and commercial employees, as compared with gentile families, where the occupational distribution was more heavily weighted in the civil service, high professions, and artisanry. Despite having received the same instruction as their gentile counterparts, Jewish secondary school graduates followed their fathers in pursuing commercial professions. Hyman's book is elegantly written and persuasively argued. On very rare occasions, however, her purpose in gathering data is not entirely clear. For example, an interesting section in chapter 4 reveals that early marriage was not common in Alsace in the nineteenth century. For brides, the age rose from twenty-three at the turn of the nineteenth century to twenty-eight after mid-century; husbands were two or three years older, on the average. Comparisons with the Christian population reveal that this phenomenon was more pronounced among Jews; Hyman's data also show that Jewish brides tended to be younger in the cities than in the countryside. Nevertheless, the significance of these suggestive and intriguing trends is unclear and inconclusive. Similarly, we are told that of the 368 Jewish marriages that took place in Bischeim, Itterswiller, and Niederroedern between 1820 and 1862, only 26 percent involved a bride and groom born in the same place. In Strasbourg during the same period 6 percent of brides and grooms were born in Strasbourg. And in sixty-three Jewish marriages in Colmar in these years none of the brides and grooms were born in the same place. What these figures imply and how they relate to the book's central thesis is not fully explicated. Nevertheless, these minor concerns hardly detract from the consistently high standard of the work and its outstanding achievements.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 229 From the standpoint of both Jewish and European historiography, The Emancipation of the Jews ofAlsace is an exceptionally important contribution. It effectively removes emancipation once and for all from the exclusive province of modernizing elites, offering a balanced, nuanced reading of tradition and change. On the more general side, Hyman's work should put to rest the dominant view in European historiography which has tended to emphasize the status and image of the Jew in general society, to the exclusion of more fruitful comparative inquiries that would advance our understanding of social mobility and the nature of European economic development. The Emancipation of the Jews of Alsace is one of the rare books in Jewish studies that will undoubtedly have a profound impact in both areas. Jay R.
