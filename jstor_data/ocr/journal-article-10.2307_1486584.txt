<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ze'ev W. Falk. Religious Law and Ethics: Studies in Biblical and Rabbinical Theonomy. Jerusalem: Mesharim Publishers, 1991. 221 pp. It is difficult to describe Ze'ev Falk's Religious Law and Ethics as being a work of Jewish philosophy, Jewish law and ethics, Mishpat Ivri, or even a sociological study of the development of halakhah, because it is all these things and much more. The volume is a unique work, about which the author states: "I tried to discuss Jewish legal sources from the point of view of modem jurisprudence and legal theory, then added aspects of political science and sociology, as well as a comparison with other religious laws. Time and again I wrestled with the problem of conflict between Jewish law and ethics, so that I finally felt compelled to write the present book" (p. 217). The basic question of the book is whether there is a Jewish ethics independent of halakhah and why. Falk's arguments are generally compelling and insightful but also selective. Examples of his insights include: 1. The use of the term "theonomy" to describe the biblical and rabbinic legal and ethical systems is an important distinction, although the distinctions between the two theonomies are never totally developed. 2. Arguments (with proof-texts and citations) which demonstrate how Jewish sources are both teleological and deontological in nature, but primarily the latter (pp. 41-45 [biblical] and pp. 136-140 [rabbinic]). These arguments present a much fuller picture of Jewish sources than in many other studies. 3. The major question of whether Jewish ethics can fulfill the minimum philosophical standard of being universal in scope is answered in the affirma- tive by this book. Falk's study of the question goes further than most other studies in the field in analyzing the sociological influences which affect the "universality" of Jewish ethics (pp. 47-54, 142-147). 4, The author also demonstrates that it is possible to isolate the ethical principles of Judaism from Judaism's sources, which is of critical importance</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 299 to the development of Mishpat Ivri in Israel as Israelis struggle to create a system of modem law which simultaneously is rooted in Jewish tradition but is not directly related to exact halakhic decisions and decisors. The author presents, in good philosophical fashion, many of the modem opinions on the question, but early on establishes his view that Jewish ethics can and must be independent of halakhah. He states: "One must have an ethical knowledge independently of the religious authority, even of God himself' (p. 1). To its credit, the book presents the widest possible variety of thinkers on this question, including such varied modem writers as E. Berkovits, D. Bleich, M. Fox, D. Weiss-Halivni, A. Lichtenstein, D. Novak, S. Siegel, A. J. Heschel, J. B. Solveitchik, and many others. The book is written as a series of short (usually 1- to 3-page) vignettes (or chapters) on most of the major meta-questions of Jewish ethics and law, and does not flow neatly from chapter to chapter. It appears that the literary model Falk had in mind was a cross between an encyclopedia article, a philosophical tome, and a law code, and in each chapter there are selected citations from biblical and rabbinical works to support his arguments. The format and the scope of the book are, therefore, both problematic and useful. Some of the problems involve: 1. Over a third of the book is devoted to an investigation of biblical ethics (84 pages), another third to (classical) rabbinical ethics (81 pages), with a small sampling of Hellenistic literature (4 pages) and medieval ideas (16 pages) as well as selected modern sources (16 pages) relating to the questions raised in the first two-thirds of the book. Unfortunately, the encyclopedic range of issues and format of the book leave the reader always waiting for a much longer analysis of the issues raised in each section. 2. Although the author employs many modem philosophical arguments and methodologies to analyze biblical and rabbinic texts, he did not gener- ally employ any of the results of modem text-critical studies of the Bible and rabbinic literature, which would have given the work another level of discourse. 3. Also, the attempt to be totally encyclopedic in the ancient period leads to the difficulty of presenting only four pages on some 500 years of Jewish source materials in the chapters on postbiblical ethics (Second Temple/Hellenistic/Greco-Roman), and only selections which support his basic thesis for the over 1,000 years from the close of the Talmud to the eighteenth century. Overall, however, this format does perform the useful service of giving a</page><page sequence="3">300 BOOK REVIEWS history of Jewish ethics according to the idea of an independent ethical tradi- tion which is supported by other modem studies of religious and philosophical ethics from different religious and academic perspectives. The format also invites further reading, and an extensive bibliography and citation system are included in the book. While this may not be the definitive book on the subject of the systematic analysis of the meta-issues of Jewish law and ethics, it is an innovative and informative work which suggests that others should follow Falk's lead in this area.
