Studies on Personalities of the Old Testament. Columbia: University of South Car- olina Press, 2003. xii, 186 pp. The purpose of Wright's study is to trace "the evolution of the depictions of Baruch ben Neriah ... from the biblical materials through the early Jewish and Christian texts and traditions that either mention Baruch or were allegedly written by him" (xi). The book succeeds admirably. In three main chapters, Wright collects and analyzes most of the material about Baruch from the first mention of him in Jeremiah as the prophet's scribal assistant to works as late as 3 Baruch that picture him as a recipient of apocalyptic visions. A fourth chapter contains traditions about Baruch in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources into the Middle Ages. Wright argues that different communities intentionally molded the persona of Baruch to fit their images of an ideal leader. His chapter titles set out a gradual transformation of the figure of Baruch from "The Scribe" (Chap. 1) to "The Sage" (Chap. 2) to "The Apocalyptic Seer" (Chap. 3). So, for example, one of the earli- est interpretations of (at least one form of) the book of Jeremiah, the Greek trans- lation in the Septuagint, makes Baruch the prophetic successor of Jeremiah, an idea that is at best implicit in the Masoretic text. This elevation of Baruch from scribal assistant to prophetic successor "provides at least part of the reason for the in- creasing prominence of Baruch in later Jewish and Christian texts" (37). Wright successfully shows that the developments in the character of Baruch are essentially grounded in the biblical accounts, but as the idea of what makes a scribe or prophet changes, Baruch gets constructed along those lines. Thus, the Book of Baruch, written somewhere in the late second century BCE to the first century CE, expands the protagonist's role as a scribe specializing in writing to that of a scribe who is also a sage or wisdom teacher, a position most notably embod- ied in the Jerusalemite scribe and wisdom teacher, Jesus ben Sira. As a sage, Baruch gives wisdom teaching, and the book that bears his name includes a poem praising Wisdom (3:9-4:4) in which access to God's wisdom comes only through obedience to the Mosaic Torah. Along similar lines, Baruch's role as Jeremiah's prophetic successor leads to the composition of works like 2 Baruch in which he receives revelations from God providing him access to matters otherwise un- knowable to ordinary human beings. In each of these cases, Wright argues that these developments in the persona of Baruch reflect community interests and needs. So, Baruch the sage reflects the growing importance of the scribe-sage as a community leader in Second Temple Jewish society, and Baruch the seer pro- vides the explanations and comfort for the suffering of the Jewish people in the wake of the destruction of the Temple by the Romans. While Wright's study reveals the contours of the picture of Baruch as it de- velops over time, the way he structures the book highlights the complicated nature 361</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews of identifying specific social positions or roles such as sage or seer or scribe in Second Temple Jewish society. In many cases these roles overlap, and it is diffi- cult to separate them as distinct positions as Wright does in his book. Indeed, Wright frequently has to refer in one place to a role he has discussed somewhere else. For example, he notes in Chapter 3 that the Book of Baruch portrays Baruch as following in the footsteps of Moses, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Ezra when he gath- ers the people to hear the "word of the Lord." In this way he speaks with a prophet- ic voice, and thus, the sage also acts as prophet (which he discusses in Chap. 2), a role that Ben Sira also adopts (see Sirach 24). In the same chapter, Wright dis- cusses the Paraleipomena of Jeremiah in which Baruch receives angelic revela- tions about the fate of Jerusalem (the subject of Chap. 4). In Chapter 4, Wright analyzes 2 Baruch, which often portrays Baruch as an inspired interpreter ofTorah, a function more characteristic of the scribe-sage than of the recipient of apoca- lyptic visions. Wright is certainly aware of these complications, and I suspect that because the book is intended for a general rather than for a scholarly audience Wright made each chapter focus on a single ideal type. One final issue further underscores the complex relationships between the various roles that Baruch plays in the traditions about him. Wright notes at the very beginning of the book that Baruch may very well have come from a family of priests. In a number of places Wright comments on the intercessory role that Baruch plays. In one remarkable passage in 2 Baruch, Baruch leaves the people to go to the ruined Temple in Jerusalem to get further information from God. He says to them, "God forbid that I should forsake you or leave you. I am going alone to the Holy of Holies so that I may ask from the Holy One on your and Zion's behalf if I may be enlightened some more, and afterward I will return to you" (82). By going to the Holy of Holies alone-essentially to act as an intermediary between God and the people-Baruch takes on a high priestly role. Yet, Wright does not concentrate anywhere on Baruch's priestly or intercessory role, although he men- tions it often. Overall, however, Wright pulls together and synthesizes a large quantity of material. He is to be commended for bringing such widely diverse traditions into a study that is readily accessible to the general reader. Scholars often work in a world where they are almost completely concerned with communicating the re- sults of their investigations to other scholars. More and more, though, scholars are looking to find avenues for bringing their work to the continually growing non- specialist audience that is interested in ancient Judaism and Christianity. One of the strengths of this book is that specialists and interested nonspecialists alike will find it engaging and informative. Benjamin G.
