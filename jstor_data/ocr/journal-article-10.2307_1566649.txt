Scholars of literature and religion, historians, and experts in allied fields, stimulated in part by the new accessibility of long-hidden archival materials in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, have begun to re-envision East European Jewry and its place in modem Jewish history and culture. In 2002-2003, the CAJS will sponsor an interdisciplinary seminar devoted to assembling and placing in perspective the fruits of the new scholarship. Among the possible questions the seminar will consider are: What are the limits of "crisis" as an explanatory model for individual and collective change among East European Jews? In what ways did East European Jewry remain a coherent entity across the periodic recastings of political boundaries in the region? What were the lines of influence between Jews and their mostly Slavic neighbors? The seminar will also consider neglected issues of gender and economic life among East European Jews. What historical contexts made possible the rise in Eastern Europe of Jewish cultural modernism, with the ideal of the emancipated (male or female) self at its center? How have the pioneering figures of Jewish scholarship in Eastern Europe, with their pronounced populist bent, shaped the field's intellectual lineage? How can attention to the intersection of elite and popular culture illuminate such epochal developments as the rise of Hasidism as a mass movement, the political mobilization of the Jewish 'silent majority' at the beginning of the 20th century, and the renewal of Jewish national identity in the USSR during the Cold War? The Center invites applications from post-doctoral candidates in the humanities and social sciences. Outstanding graduate students in the final stages of writing their dissertations may also apply. Stipend amounts are based on a Fellows' academic standing and financial need with a maximum of $32,000 for the academic year. A contribution may also be made towards travel expenses. Application deadline is November 15, 2001. Awards will be announced on January 15, 2002.

Gross One summer day in 1941, half of the Polish town of Jedwabne murdered the other half-1,600 men, women, and children-all but seven of the town's Jews. Neighbors tells their story. "This is unquestionably one of the most important books I have read in the last decade both on the gen- eral question of the mass murder of the Jews during World War II and on the more specific problem of the reaction of Polish society to that genocide. All of the issues it raises are handled with consummate mas- tery."-Antony Polonsky, Brandeis University Cloth $19.95 ISBN 0-691-08667-2 Due April The Fragility of Goodness Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust Tzvetan Todorov Translated by Arthur Denner With the exception of Denmark, Bulgaria was the only country allied with Nazi Germany that did not annihilate or turn over its Jewish population. Here a prominent French intellectual with Bulgarian roots accounts for this singularity.
