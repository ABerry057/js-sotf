Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 1995. 298 pp. (Hebrew). On the morning of June 22, 1989, Menahem Stem left his home to walk, as was his practice, to the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University. He never arrived. The terrorists who murdered him deprived the world of its leading scholar on the history of the Jews in the Greco-Roman period. In the sixty-four years that were allotted to him, Stem made a series of major contributions. After completing his doctorate he helped prepare the Corpus Papyrorum ludaicarum (1957-64), appearing as a co-author on the third and final volume. In 1965 he published The Documents on the History of the Hasmonean Revolt (in Hebrew; a second, revised and expanded edition appeared in 1972), and his magnum opus, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism, appeared in three volumes between 1974 and 1984. As the latter project neared completion, Stem turned his attention to a new task. He planned a multivolume, detailed survey of Jewish history in Second Temple times. This was to be the overview which would synthesize the results of his decades of research on the sources and documents. In fact, Stem already had published a large body of synthetic historical studies. Anyone who has used his books knows how much historiography is contained in the introductions and commentaries to the sources. For example, his notes on Cassius Dio, Historia Romana LXIX, 12:1-14:3 in Greek and Latin Authors, vol. 2, pp. 393-405, constitute a "mini-monograph" on the Bar Kokhva revolt. Further, he produced dozens of scholarly articles, collected and published posthumously in 1991 as Studies in Jewish History: The Second Temple Period. Finally, he contributed survey articles to various handbooks published between 1969 and 1983. Nevertheless, the loss of his projected multivolume history is a grievous one. Following Stem's death, his widow, Havah, invited Daniel Schwartz of Hebrew University to examine the manuscript material left behind in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 113 his files. Schwartz discovered full or partial drafts in varying degrees of readiness of some forty chapters from the projected book, covering the period from Alexander the Great till Augustus and Herod. The earlier period, from Alexander through Judah the Maccabee, and the career of Herod had already been surveyed by Stem in print. Consequently, it was decided to publish the drafts of the chapters which deal with the intermediate period from Jonathan the Hasmonean through the conquest of Jerusalem by Herod, i.e., from about 158 to 37 B.C.E. The result is the book before us, which contains twenty-one chapters, an introduction by the editor, a select bibliography, and an index of persons and places. In his introduction, Schwartz shares with us the dilemmas he faced in preparing the material and the solutions he adopted. On rare occasions some sentences were rearranged, but generally Schwartz limited himself to brief additions in the text for purposes of clarity and additional bibliography in the notes, both in brackets. He is also responsible for the order of the chapters and their arrangement into four units. In addition, each chapter begins with a brief summary by Schwartz, printed in smaller type, which provides continuity and a general orientation to the subject of the chapter. As the subtitle indicates, the subject of the book is political history. Stem's interests extended beyond this, as illustrated by his 1968 article, "The Hasmonean Revolt and Its Place in the History of Jewish Society and Religion." In the book before us, however, at least half of the chapters focus not on the history of Judah, but on that of the regional powers and the neighboring states: the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms, Rome, Parthia, and the Itureans. And even the chapters which deal directly with the Hasmonean state concentrate on foreign relations. International politics, of course, forms both the backdrop and at least part of the explanation for the rise and fall of the Hasmonean dynasty. The more serious limitations of this book are threefold. The surveys of Hellenistic history repeat what is readily available elsewhere, the bibliography is not up to date, and much of the specifically Hasmonean history was already treated by Stem in his publications. In mitigation, such surveys are less available in Hebrew, Schwartz has partially updated the bibliography, and new material does appear. Thus on pp. 73-75, Stern makes the case that Jonathan was the "most practiced diplomat" produced by the Hasmonean dynasty. And on pp. 195-199, Stem comments on the parallel accounts in Josephus and the Babylonian Talmud about the rift between the Pharisees and the Hasmoneans.

B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1995. xiii, 270 pp. This book is intended as a feminist work which "makes use of all the sources and source-critical techniques to describe in a well-balanced and Sthorough manner the history of Jewish wsomen in Palestine during a period of such great interest and so many vicissitudes" (p. 21). The result is a detailed study covering a broad range of uissues, such as sexuality (e.g., virginity, chastity, pregnancy), legal statuso (e.g., testimony, inheritance), and social institutions (e.g., marriage, divorce), and considers a number of individual figures, such as Beruriah and Matrona. Each section provides a description and analysis of primary sources, and, in some cases, interaction with scholarly opinion. The strength of this study lies in its detailed presentation of rabbinic sources. For example, the discussion of inheritance examines texts fr~om the Mishnah, Tosefta, Babylonian Talmud, Jerusalem Talmud, and Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, and briefly considers nonrabbinic texts, such as Judith and the writings of Josephus. On the basis of these sources, Tal Ilan argues that a father or husband was permitted to transfer property to his daughters or wife to ensure a reasonable standard of living after his death, "all this despite the quite specific biblical laws against inheritance and property ownership by women" (p. 170).' The discussion of Beruriah not only gathers the relevant primary 1. Of course, the biblical data suggest that this statement requires some qualification. The episode of the daughters of Zelophehad in Numbers 27 and 36 demonstrates that women could inherit, at least when there were no sons; and the statement in Proverbs 31:16 and the transaction recorded in Ruth 4 demonstrate that women could own, buy, and sell property.</page></plain_text>
