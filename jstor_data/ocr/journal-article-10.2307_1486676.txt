Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1994. xii, 290 pp. In this book James E Harris analyzes the struggle for emancipation of Bavarian Jewry, which formed the largest group of Jews in Germany outside of Prussia. The author is well versed in recent German secondary literature, yet he has presented us with a work which is thoroughly based on primary sources. Among the sources which have been investigated are newspapers, records of parliamentary debates, and the archives of Munich, Upper Bavaria, and Wtirzburg. Harris is professor of German history at the University of Maryland and well known for his works on general history. He furnishes us with a good introduction to the history of rural Jewry, an area hitherto neglected by historiography. One may argue that there is a difference between racial antisemitism and anti-Jewish animosity. Sources from the early nineteenth century, such as one from the year 1828, should have been consulted in this regard. However, in the English-language literature the term "antisemitism" has become the designation for any anti-Jewish attitude irrespective of content since pagan times. Harris himself refers to the German debate on the usage of this term, in which context he cites such authors as Reinhard Ruirup and Thomas Nipperdey (pp. 209 ff.). Harris views the anti-emancipation movement in Bavaria, which forced the government to withdraw its progressive political proposals in this regard, as the first instance of an indigenous antisemitic movement. Anti-government petitions were signed by 68,000 men from 1,753 localities. It is interesting to note that Harris cites Jacob Toury to bolster his argument (p. 215). However, the article cited is only a summary of Toury's much more important Hebrew book,' which has not yet been translated. Since Harris is able to cite Hebrew literature on other occasions (e.g., his reference to the Pinkas HaKehilot of Baruch Zvi Ophir on p. 274), we wonder why he did not refer to the original and full version of Toury's work. Harris argues that the antisemitism of the 1870s and 1880s has to be understood in the context of the mass movement of 1848-50. His contextual argument is valid. However, in the light of the fact that the population of Bavaria at that time was 4.5 million, one must conclude that the majority of the populace remained indifferent. 1. Turmoil and Confusion in the Revolution of 1848 [Heb.] (Tel Aviv, 1968).</page><page sequence="2">182 BOOK REVIEWS Harris devotes an appreciable part of his study to an analysis of early Catholic anti-Jewish propaganda, in particular the Catholic press. This is a topic which has been neglected by most researchers, who have dealt more with the Protestant penchant to National Socialism. In so doing, he falls in line with some of the most recent German historians, such as Michael Langer, who has focused on populist Catholic writing in the nineteenth century.2 In summary, Harris's study is a well-documented book that emphasizes the continuity of anti-Jewish feeling throughout the nineteen century, culminating in the mass movement of 1848-50.
