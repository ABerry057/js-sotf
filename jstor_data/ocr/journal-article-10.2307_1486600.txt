<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM SEPARATION TO DISPLACEMENT: THE PROBLEM OF WOMEN IN SEFER HASIDIM by JUDITH R. BASKIN A gender analysis of some of the representations of women in Sefer Hasidim and related texts finds that the German-Jewish pietiests of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries express a profound ambivalence toward women. While Sefer Hasidim places great importance on happy marital relations, its authors also see potential adulteries at every turn. Moreover, in their mystical yearning to transcend the physical pleasures of the material world, they go beyond rabbinic norms in their displacement of women in favor of devotion to the divine. This essay suggests that situating this ambivalence, and the frequent objectification of women which results from it, within the larger context of medieval social history can expand and enhance our knowledge of Jewish social norms, family life, and spirituality in medieval Ashkenaz. Consideration of the consequences of gender as a category of historical analysis is a significant development in recent historiography. While historians of previous eras tended to assume that social circumstances or historical change affected the two sexes similarly, gender analysis has shown that this is often far from the case. Indeed, gender studies have shown that historical An earlier version of this paper, "Images of Women in Sefer Hasidimn," was delivered at Mystik, Magie und Kabbala im Aschkenasischen Judentum, a conference held at Frankfurt am Main, December 1991, and was published with the conference proceedings in Mysticisnm and Magic in Judaism: An International Symposium Held in Frankfurt, 1991, ed.

BASKIN transformations in many eras affect men and women quite differently.' In addition, introducing gender as a factor in the study of Jewish societies, endeavors, and achievements has revealed a persistent pattern of limiting women's access to public activities and the status they confer, and has highlighted the ways in which women have been excluded from the education and empowerment which would allow them to function and achieve in the male cultural sphere of learning and communal prayer and leadership, even as it has directed attention to Jewish women's consistently significant economic roles, and to areas in which they have constructed their own, usually uncelebrated, cultures and cultural achievements.2 Such an approach has profound implications in studying the ways women are portrayed in a body of medieval Jewish literature which was written by men and intended for a male audience. We cannot find women's voices in Sefer Hasidimn or in the other writings of the German-Jewish pietists; we cannot know what any individual woman of that circle thought or felt, although occasionally we may know how they acted. Rather, we are left with one male elite's perceptions of a wide range of females and female behaviors, both approved and disapproved. Women are represented both positively and negatively in Sefer Hasidim. Generally, women who are part of the pietistic circle are depicted favorably. Pietists are advised to marry women who share their values, even at the cost of parental disapproval;3 a woman may certainly be "pious" (hasidah); 1.

Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, not only plays religious roles, such as leading women's prayers in the synagogue, but expends much of her energy in supporting her household so that her husband may devote himself to study, and sacrifices her life to summon help when her family is attacked, leaving behind a truly bereft and desolate spouse.5 Yet women, even the most pious, simply by virtue of their sex, have the potential, however unwittingly, to tempt a man to sin or sinful thoughts. For this reason Sefer Hasidim recommends extremely limited social converse with women, including one's own wife, advising: Each one who wishes to return in repentance and achieve a status of piety ... let him forsake'... converse with his wife except while making love ... and let this not be a burden upon him because of his love for his Creator.6 Yet maintaining too great a distance from one's wife may also lead to sin. For the pietist, happy marital relations in themselves become an essential fence against the possibility of sexual temptation elsewhere. As Eleazar of Worms advises, "One should avoid looking at other women and have sex with one's wife with the greatest passion because she guards him from sin"; and "since she is his intimate partner he should display affection and love toward her."7 Similarly, Sefer Hasidim counsels that time and effort should be devoted to 4. Disputes between husband and wife over giving charity must have been frequent. For several examples, see SHP, pars. 669, 670, and 1715.

Dolce, the wife of Eleazar of Worms, was attacked with the rest of her household by two armed intruders in December 1196.

BASKIN building a positive and creative sexual relationship within marriage so that the husband's thoughts will not stray to other women.8 In an atmosphere so conscious of sexuality, gender becomes a crucial societal determinant. Ivan Marcus has suggested that for Sefer Hasidim the social world divides into three groups, pietist Jews, non-pietist Jews, and Christians, and he notes that qualities of wealth or poverty, learning or ignorance, or differences in societal position are all insignificant compared to these discriminations.9 The women encountered in Sefer Hasidim also fall into these three major categories (with several subcategories for each group as well, based on age, marital status, and occupation). But I would argue that their gender unites all women in the eyes of the German-Jewish pietists far more than they are separated by variations in religion, level of piety, or social status, since any woman can lead a man into sexual transgression. Indeed, significant portions of Sefer Hasidim focus on such violations, how atonement may be undertaken by male transgressors, and how repentance may be achieved.10 How females might do penance for their sexual indiscretions, however, is not a subject which is considered. The consequent reification of women as objects of desire or causes of sin, but not as sinners themselves in need of redemption, has not been much noticed, nor has it prompted scholarly explanation. Certainly, from the perspective of rabbinic Judaism, there is little new in Sefer Hasidim's admonitions to avoid women. Rabbinic Judaism, with its acute consciousness of human sexuality's potential for causing societal disorder if strict controls are lacking, particularly as regards marital infidelity and consequent uncertain lineage of children, ordains distinct separations between men and women, the roles they can play, and the status which pertains to each sex. In this patriarchal system, women as a group are fundamentally "other," constituting a separate category of human creature, and their activities are ideally confined to the private sphere of husband, children, and family economic endeavors, where there is much less possibility of falling into unsanctioned sexual liaisons." The German-Jewish pietists 8. See SHB, par. 509, which advocates a male superior position for sexual intercourse when conception is desired, since this is most pleasurable for the woman (should she achieve orgasm first she is likely to conceive a son), but rules that at other times the man may conduct their sex life as he wishes in order to prevent fantasies about other women. 9.

As Monford Harris has noted, "From the days of the Talmud until Sepher Hassidim (and perhaps for a considerable time afterward) there is no other sustained Jewish work where not only is man's love for woman so continuously referred to, but also stated as being so serious an issue.""' Sefer Hasidim recognizes that joyful sexual relations within marriage constitute only a partial fence against sin. The human inclination to extend that happiness through sexual encounters with others cannot be ruled out, and this realization also plays a part in Sefer's Hasidim's ambivalence toward women and fear of the power they can exert over men. A statement like the following, which advises that the pious should not look at the faces or forms of women, and which, incidentally, reveals some of the occasions upon which a man might do so, and the varieties of women he might observe, reflects the tension between rabbinic teachings and medieval social reality: The main strength of the pious man from beginning to end is that although they scoff at him he does not forsake his piety, his intent is for heaven's sake and he does not look at the countenances of women: especially so among other men where women are customarily seen, for example, if he has been in the wedding hall where the women were garbed in choicest ornaments and all were gazing but he did not stare, for that he will merit the great good that is laid up, as it is written, "which thou hast laid up for those that fear thee" (Ps. 31:20). And his eye will be satiated with the Divine Glory: "thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty" (Isa. 33:17). For this reason it is best for the individual when he meets a woman, whether single or married, whether a gentile woman or Jewish, whether she be of age or a minor, to turn his face aside from looking at her. Thus do we find in Job (3:1), "I have made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid." And thus it is written in the book of Ben Sira, "Avert your eyes from a beautiful woman, lest you stumble and incur Exploration of Women's Issues in Halakhic Sources (New York, 1984); Judith Romney Wegner, Chattel or Person?

So Isaiah 33:15, "And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil," refers to him who gazes not upon women at the time when they stand by their wash. When they wash their garments and lift their skirts so as not to soil them, they uncover their legs, and we know a woman's leg is a sexual incitement and so said the sage, "nothing interposes better before desire, than closing one's eyes."13 The connection of Isaiah 33:15 with women washing garments is first made in B. Baba Bathra 57b; the statement that "a woman's leg is a sexual incitement" is from B. Berakhot 24a. It is Sefer Hasidim, however, which makes the connection between these two passages, providing in the process not only a vivid glimpse of how medieval women went about washing their clothes, but of its author's conviction of the ubiquity of sexual provocation. Thus, if there is nothing novel in Sefer Hasidim's negative attitudes toward women as potential snares to the righteous, I believe the German-Jewish pietists were far more anxious about the perils of uncontrolled sexuality than the rabbis, and consequently the concern to minimize male-female contacts as much as possible became a central focus of their endeavor. As Marcus has noted, "No temptation was more alluring for the pietist as sexual relations with a woman other than his wife."'4 This concern is, in fact, universalized to all men, and the pietist must not only limit himself from unlicensed sexual activity, but has the added obligation to protect others as well. One such exemplum, found in manuscript, relates that a pietist who was teaching his daughters to write justified his actions as follows: If they do not know how to write, they will be forced to request men to write their receipts for pledges when they lend money. They will be alone with those men who write for them and they may sin, and this will be my fault, for whenever it is in one's ability to construct a fence for sin and one does not do it, it is as if one has caused it, as it is written in Hosea 4:13: "I will not punish 13. SHB, par. 9 (some of this passage is also found in SHP, par. 978); translation is from Sholom Alchanan Singer, Medieval Jewish Mysticism: Book of the Pious (Northbrook, Ill., 1971), p. 9. As David Biale, Eros and the Jews, notes about other passages from Sefer Hasidimn and related writings, such narratives also function, albeit unconsciously, to arouse erotic excitement: "In the process of resisting the erotic temptations of his culture, Judah the Hasid ended up unwittingly reinforcing it" (p. 73). 14.

And even if they do not sin, they may think about it. Moreover, he did not want them to acquire a bad reputation, and thus he taught them to write receipts for pledges, and he taught them that whenever it was time for their immersion they should not delay, for when her husband desires her she should be ready, so that he will not engage in bad thoughts, and so that she will preserve him from all such fantasies.15 This passage is fascinating on a number of levels, not least in the window it opens into the social reality of women's moneylending activities, and in its allusion to apparent debates over appropriate levels of female education.16 Teaching one's daughters to write is reported here as something unusual which requires justification. And the justification, while based on women's business needs, is not directly related to them, but to fears of sexual indiscretions, whether actual or imagined, which may follow from a woman who cannot write asking a male neighbor for secretarial aid. It is the duty of the father to construct barriers to sin, and in this instance, the dangers connected with female literacy, well recognized and documented in many medieval literatures, both Jewish and Christian, as leading to inchastity, are outweighed by the more immediate hazards of frequent female-male propinquity. It is assumed, of course, that it will be the father and not some other man who will be the daughters' instructor. Moreover, while it may appear at first that the writer is concerned with his daughters' spiritual well-being, it is no accident that he immediately goes on to stress a woman's duty to make herself accessible to her husband's sexual needs as expeditiously as she can, so that he will not succumb to inappropriate thoughts, possibly prompted by encounters with other women. Clearly, the driving need here is with preserving men from sin, whether the father, who would otherwise be to blame for not educating his daughters, or the husband, who might be led to indiscretion because his sexual needs had not been satisfied at home, or indeed, the helpful but susceptible male scribes to whom illiterate women might have recourse. The daughters, literate or not, are essentially seen as objects which can occasion sin in men, 15.

BASKIN and satisfactory and readily available sex within marriage is presented as the only possible antidote. Another story in Sefer Hasidim describes the confession of a man who loved another man's wife. His affection is returned, and during her husband's extended absence on a business trip the couple, who live in the same house, engage in all manner of sexual foreplay, stopping short only of intercourse. Still, the man confesses, he did not enjoy doing these things because "my heart was intent on having intercourse. For several years I acted this way [i.e., refrained from intercourse] in order to receive a reward." He goes on to say, "My father did the same thing. The sole difference between us was that in his case the woman was a minor as well as married. My father also did the same thing with his mother-in-law and with his wife's sister during his wife's lifetime." The young man is uncertain of the degree of his transgression, or if he has sinned at all: "I am asking you the following question: Must I repent and do penance for this? Does my father, even if he acted for the sake of Heaven [i.e., by not having intercourse]? Or will we receive a reward, since we were saved from sinning?"" The result of consultation with the pietist is that the man and his father are criticized for the rather venial sin of being alone with married women. This story appears in the context of individuals who deliberately court temptation in order to successfully resist it. Since sexual intercourse, which could lead to an illicit pregnancy with all of its dangerous consequences for social disorder and confusion of lineage, did not take place, the offense is apparently minor, although such behavior is certainly not sanctioned. Although there is some scholarly debate over whether or not this story represents an actual situation," its appearance in Sefer Hasidim is indicative of German-Jewish pietist concerns about the level of sexual promiscuity in 17. SHP, pars. 52-53; the entire passage is translated by Marcus in Rabbinic Fantasies, pp. 220-223. 18. Harris, "Concept of Love," pp. 24-27, is convinced that there is no doubt of the story's authenticity (p. 24), and views it as "a behavior typical of courtly love in which the 'furtive embrace' [intended to enflame desire while resisting consummation] can take place only outside wedlock" (p. 26). Recently, Eli Yassif, "The Exemplary Story in Sefer Hasidim," Tarbiz 57 (1987-88), has pointed out that this story is related to a folktale tradition found in Arabic literature, and suggests that R. Judah the Pious transformed it for his own didactic purposes (p. 224, n. 20). While Biale, Eros and the Jews, does not believe that this is a true story, he does note that regardless of its authenticity, "the text subverts its stated intent by telling a highly erotic story" (p. 73).</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF WOMEN IN SEFER HASIDIM 9 their community. That pregnancies were not improbable events as a result of adulterous behavior is implicit in a passage which discusses the extremes to which people will go for the sake of personal honor: "For example, knights go into the thick of battle and even sacrifice themselves to enhance their own reputation and to avoid being humiliated. Moreover, consider how many stratagems respectable women adopt in order to avoid being discovered after they become pregnant as the result of an affair. Not to speak of thieves! If these people work so hard only for minimal benefits, how much the more should [a pietist] be resourceful for the sake of his Creator all day and all night."19 In all these instances, whether the reported illicit liaisons really occurred, or whether such stories simply serve the didactic purposes of their teller, there is no thought given to any spiritual concerns women may have had about their participation in such indiscretions. Indeed, women appear in virtually all the passages related to sexual transgressions as totally susceptible, willing, and indeed enthusiastic participants who sometimes initiate the activities.20 This apparent blindness to the possibility that women are also moral and spiritual beings may simply be indicative of medieval Jewish thinking about women; it may also stem from rabbinic Judaism's understanding that a woman's primary duty is to enable her husband to fulfill his religious obligations. Were she herself to be involved in penances and repentance, the entire life of her family would be disrupted. It is for these reasons that an Italian sermon of the sixteenth century explicitly rebukes women who adopt ascetic practices such as daily fasting and prayer, placing ashes on their heads, and wearing sackcloth, denying themselves the enjoyment of even the smallest earthly matters, and vowing to abstain from all pleasure. Even though the author admits that the intentions of these women are good and holy, he declares their singleminded devotion to God a dereliction of their other duties. By pursuing this course a woman has not fulfilled her obligations to God because she has abandoned her husband and her home. A man will turn against his wife and hate her for taking such a course.21 It is possible that such fears of social 19. SHP, par. 2, translated by Marcus, Piety and Society, p. 28. 20.

BASKIN disorder may also account for the obliviousness to issues of female penance and repentance in Sefer Hasidim and connected writings. Another issue raised by the presentation of women as sexual objects in Sefer Hasidim and related literature is that of social veracity. It seems certain that Rabbi Judah believed that illicit encounters, which on the testimony of Sefer Hasidim might include Jewish men having sexual contact with single Jewish women and married Jewish women (of both minor and adult status), maidservants, whether Jewish or Christian, and Christian women who were not employees of Jews, were a part of everyday life in the Jewish communities of his time, and his response was to set up as many barriers as possible to men's contacts with women, even with women of their own families. Although one may be suspicious of the enthusiastic roles women, particularly minors and maidservants, who were generally powerless vis-a-vis male authority, are said to play in these episodes, even a cursory reading of Sefer Hasidim strongly suggests that Jewish social life in medieval Germany had strayed far from rabbinic norms. Thus, the concerns raised by these pietistic texts may usefully be ap- proached from the perspective of social history. Are there some realistic bases for the German-Jewish pietists' virtual obsession with sexual transgressions? Has a traditional tendency toward separation of men and women within Judaism been intensified among the German-Jewish pietists, not only by pervasive Christian concern with sexual sin, but by social conditions which allowed for an atmosphere of frequent male-female social contacts that sometimes led to sexual promiscuity? Increasingly, scholars are recognizing that the small Jewish communities of medieval Ashkenaz were not significantly isolated, in language, social custom, or intellectual and spiritual attitudes, from the people among whom they lived in such close physical contact in crowded towns. In opposition to scholars who have preferred not to take Sefer Hasidim's portrait of social life at face value, Ivan Marcus has written convincingly that in regard to sexual promiscuity, as with numerous other topics, "Sefer Hasidim is a speculum of the society in which it originated"; moreover, "it is unwarranted to dismiss the reality of the sectarian description of the Pietists in Sefer Hasidim as the result more of Judah's fantasy than of reality."22 Monford Harris came 22.

As David Biale notes in his study of social life in this era, there are numerous indications "that the Jewish population as a whole was attracted to a very different erotic code from the one that the rabbinic authorities wished to enforce."24 One factor in this social dilemma was that medieval Europe had no tradition of sequestering women comparable to what is found in societies of the Middle East. Rather, women of all classes in this monogamous society had considerable freedom of movement, and, often, significant social status. Such conditions do not allow for close control of women's behavior. Studies of medieval Christian private life describe the efforts of aristocratic and bourgeois households to keep women "under lock and key in the most isolated part of the house," because they were viewed as the weaker sex and prone to sin.25 Despite these precautions, however, even in the aristocratic household "innumerable signs attest to the irrepressibility of private sexuality, which flourished in secrecy and obscurity, in the shadows of the orchards, cellars, and palace nooks and during the small hours of darkness, unrelieved even by the light of small candles. No door was secure, and it was easy for a man to slip into a woman's bed."26 With so many people living in close things occurred is his ability to imagine them. Neither he nor his contemporaries suffered from underdeveloped libidos" (p. 1105). 23. Harris, "Concept of Love," writes that Sefer Hasidim "pictures the German community as it really was, a febrile community, full of contradictions, concerns, and unsolved problems" (p. 13). 24.

BASKIN proximity, promiscuity appears to have been a constant concern and adultery an obsession.27 In the urban bourgeois household, to which medieval Jewish family life closely conformed, sexual indiscretions were also possible. Men un- dertook long business trips, and members of extended families, including mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, cousins, and nieces, lived at close quarters. Jewish wives brought large dowries into their marriages, rendering divorce difficult and expensive, and they engaged independently in commerce, trades, and moneylending. As we have seen, opportunities for improper behavior multiplied with increased male-female business contacts, while Jewish social gatherings in this period, as witnessed by our earlier text about the varieties of enticing women to be met at a wedding reception, apparently sanctioned mixing of the sexes, despite rabbinic expressions of disapproval. Indeed, that mixed company at such gatherings was deeply established in Ashkenaz and viewed as especially dangerous is clear in the following rabbinic ordinance of the eleventh century: "it is forbidden for men and women to intermingle [at a wedding] whether at the meal, at the dancing, or at any part [of the celebration]. The women must be by themselves and the men by themselves ... for at a happy occasion, especially, the sensual passions are aroused."28 Such rulings appear to have been little heeded. In his ethical will of ca. 1357, Eleazar of Mainz advises his sons to behave "continently" in their relations to women, "avoiding mixed bathing and mixed dancing and all frivolous conversation, while my daughters ought not to speak much with strangers, nor jest nor dance with them,"29 while Israel Abrahams comments that "many Jews, especially young men and maidens, with some married couples, disobeyed the Rabbinical rule, and not only danced together, but did so in the communal dancing-hall on the Sabbath and festivals.""3 Another factor adding to sexual temptation was domestic servants. His- torians of general medieval social history note that the addition to the household of maidservants, many of whom were quite young, added sexual 27. Ibid., p. 82. 28.

The ubiquity of prostitutes in the German urban setting beginning in the twelfth century, apparently one result of a significant surplus of women in cities, also heightened the impression of readily available sexual opportunities.32 While Sefer Hasidim attempts to place the blame for Jewish failings on the influence of loose Christian mores, observing that Jews tend to follow Christian social customs in the area of sexual permissiveness,33 a study of contemporary responsa literature makes clear, as Biale concludes, "that adultery, real or alleged, was a repeated issue for the German Jews."34 Taking Sefer Hasidim somewhat more seriously in some of its accounts of Jewish social life and sexual activity in the context of serious comparisons with other medieval social and literary documents, both Jewish and Christian, would certainly lead to a more accurate assessment on this matter, albeit a discomfiting one.35 Jews were also influenced by Christian spirituality and religious thought. 31. See SHP, par. 19, on penance for sexual intercourse with a Christian maidservant. For a study of similar extended urban families in which father, mother, brothers, sisters, daughters-in-law, and domestic servants lived under the same roof, see Charles de La Ronciere, "Tuscan Notables on the Eve of the Renaissance," in A Historyl of Private Life, 2:157-309. De La Ronciere notes that in this crowded urban setting, "Servants and slaves, many of them radiant young girls, offered the men of the house a distraction that discouraged outside escapades. Bourgeois memoirs are filled with the names of bastard offspring" (p. 294); and goes on to say that "the presence of cousins and nieces could also be disturbing, particularly when they shared the same bedroom." 32. Prostitutes were a medieval social reality. The suggestion of a surplus of women in German cities as a contributory factor to the prevalence of prostitution was first made by Karl Biicher, Die Frauenfrage im Mittelalter (Tiibingen, 1910), cited and discussed in Martha Howell, "A Documented Presence: Medieval Women in Germanic Historiography," in Women in Medieval History and Historiography, ed. Susan Mosher Stuard (Philadelphia, 1987), pp. 116-119. 33. SHP, par. 1301. 34. Biale, Eros and the Jews, p. 73; Kanarfogel, "Rabbinic Attitudes," takes a more cautious approach, suggesting that "illicit sexual encounters were considered in Ashkenazic rabbinic literature as lapses on the part of individuals rather than as a larger societal problem" (p. 24). 35. As Kenneth Stow, "Jewish Family in the Rhineland," p. 1110, has suggested, Jewish scholarship has tended to extrapolate backwards from our knowledge of the ideals governing the institutions and leadership of Eastern European Jewish society in the early modern period</page><page sequence="14">14 JUDITH R. BASKIN Robert Chazan has demonstrated that "close analysis of the events of 1096 has revealed a set of Jewish communities socially integrated into the environment around them," and shows that zealous Jewish attitudes toward martyrdom must be seen in the larger context of the intense spiritual ethos of Christianity of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, which very much esteemed death in defense of one's faith.36 Similarly, medieval Christian convictions of the inherently carnal nature of human beings, the negative role of woman in man's fall, and the preferable option of celibacy for those who were capable of it, would have been known to Jews. I would contend that the special intensity of the German-Jewish pietists' uneasiness with women, and their tendency to move from separation toward displacement, also owes much to their exposure to these attitudes. The issue of celibacy is of particular interest. Yitzhak Baer, in his study of the influence of medieval Christianity on this community, pointed out that the "Jewish mystic-ascetic may never go beyond a certain point in self-denial because of legal prohibitions."37 But Sholom Alchanan Singer has noted that this does not set the Jewish mystic-ascetic apart from his non-Jewish counterpart in their common striving and spiritual personality: "In a manner of speaking, both Christian and Jewish mystics strive and achieve the extreme within their respective faiths that is permissable."38 I would suggest that while the celibacy which Christian spirituality celebrated was not an option for Jewish men, who were enjoined to procreate, and for whom marital sexual relations constituted a fence against temptation, this does not mean that the idea of enforced separations between men and women was unattractive. For the German-Jewish pietists, to constantly temper desire by channeling it to fulfill legal obligations and achieve avoidance of sin was already to practice a sort of celibacy within marriage. This displacement of women from a central role in marital relations was furthered by pietistic traditions throughout Jewish history which have sought to transform human sexuality into erotic theology. But perhaps more than for a Christian celibate, to the medieval Jewish communities of the Rhineland. It may be, as he says, that the medieval Jewish family, and, I would add, its social setting, was something quite distinct. 36.

As vessels of sexuality, therefore, women had to be objectified, made strangers even when they were at home. This point needs to be emphasized: what is at stake in the attitude of the German-Jewish pietists toward women is the nature of their own devotion to the divine. As Joseph Dan has written, "God expects the hasid to break the laws of nature, of the human body and soul, and of human history and society"39 in the almost impossible effort to achieve the miracle of full adherence to divine wishes. As Dan describes it, through this intense mystical love, which is presented in erotic terms, the righteous may hope to achieve a closer relationship with the revealed divine glory.40 Such spiritual and, indeed, erotic concentration must not be directed elsewhere, and as Sefer Hasidim itself demands: The root of loving God is loving God with all your heart (Deut. 6:4) ... And the joy of this love is of such intensity and so overpowers the heart of those who love God, that even after many days of not being with his wife and having a great desire for her, in the hour that a man ejaculates he does not find it as satisfying as the intensity and power of loving God and finding joy in his Creator .... He must love the Creator with a great and strong love until he becomes sick because of his love, as the man who is lovesick for the affections of a woman and reels constantly because of his love, when he sits, rises, goes and comes, also when he eats and drinks. He neither sleeps nor slumbers because of this love. Greater than this should love of the Creator be in the hearts of those who love Him, and they should be absorbed in it constantly, as we were commanded, "with all thy heart, with all thy soul .. ." (Deut. 6:4).41 In light of this exaltation of divine over human love, the following excerpt from Sefer Hasidimn seems less social commentary than an allegory of suppressed desire. This passage, which begins, "A man should not invite women into his house lest he have sinful thoughts about them," enumerates the temptations to undesirable behavior which can befall a man who is not 39.

BASKIN fastidious as to his companions, profession, and dwelling place, and offers this parable: Go and learn from a gentile prince. Once there was a ruler in whose territory people gathered at a large fair. They came from everywhere, and all on the same day. Many prostitutes also flocked there, and the prostitutes had a madam. The ruler said to his servant, "Take a large sum of money and hire all the prostitutes because tomorrow people will come to the fair. After you have hired all of them and given them everything they want, put them all in a house, prepare a comfortable bed for each, give them food, drink, and wool to work, and guard them until the fair is over. Then send them home." The servant went and spoke to the madam, "I will give your women everything you wish-above and beyond what you would normally earn." And he gave her everything she stipulated. He brought the prostitutes to a house and guarded them there. When the fair was over, he brought them back to town. He did this every time there was a fair that attracted prostitutes. And how much more so should a Jew, who must keep his distance from those who sin! Therefore God commanded: "There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel" (Deut. 23:18). And it is written, "Visit your neighbor sparingly" (Prov 25:17). Consider: If there are two friends in business together, and one of them has a beautiful wife, better that he should go to your house [than you to his].42 On one level, this story reads as a wistful pietist's meditation on con- tructing barriers against a complex urban phenomenon which affected his community: if only prostitutes were not driven by financial necessity to entice susceptible men into illicit sexual behavior, a major cause of sin would be eliminated. Yet the prince, who is also driven by financial necessity, finds a way to eliminate prostitution while preserving the fair and sustaining the women. Perhaps this encourages us to read this story as an allegory, in which we may substitute all women for the prostitutes. How much simpler and less confused male existence would be if some powerful force would sequester and support all the women somewhere else, so that men could be saved from the temptations and complications the other sex engenders. This is why both the beginning and the conclusion of the story do not deal with prostitutes but simply with the everyday occurrence of finding another man's wife attractive. Commerce, like marriage, is necessary, but must contact with other men's wives be a part of daily life? Sefer Hasidinm's approbation of a gentile prince 42.

This urge for separation from the anxieties and confusions inherent in male-female relations was not unique to this epoch in Jewish history. We find from late antiquity that some men would leave wife and family for lengthy periods of study in rabbinic academies.43 But in the Christian environment this pietistic trend toward separation from women and all that contact with them entails becomes intensified, as in the writings of the German-Jewish pietists, which express a profound ambivalence about even the joys of licensed sexuality, which has the potential either to distract a man from God or to lead him into extramarital sexual activity. Such tensions, with their accompanying displacement of women, reach an apogee in the withdrawal from family stress and the threats of modernity offered by the sexual asceticism of the Hasidic courts and rabbinic yeshivot of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with all their attendant negative feelings about women.44 It therefore seems to me that what David Biale has written of the displacement of human sexuality in favor of asceticism in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Eastern European Hasidism applies as well to the ideology of the German-Jewish pietists, if to a lesser extent: "Even permitted sexual acts must be divorced from desire; or, to put it differently, the fantasies and emotions connected with sexual arousal must be transformed into a spiritual love of God." And, Biale further notes, "this negative attitude toward [human] sexuality was often bound up with frank expressions of misogyny incorporating many of the demonic images of women that ran throughout rabbinic, kabbalistic, and folk traditions."45 As Ada Rapoport- Albert has written on the same subject, the association of women with 43. See, for example, B. Ketubot 62b for several such accounts. 44. See David Biale, "Ejaculatory Prayer: The Displacement of Sexuality in Chasidism," Tikkun 6, no. 4 (July-August 1991): 21-25, 87-89; and Ada Rapaport-Albert, "On Women in Hasidism, S. A. Horodecky and the Maid of Ludmir Tradition," in Jewish Histoy: Essays in Honour of Chimen Abranmsky ed. Ada Rapoport-Albert and Steven J. Zipperstein (London, 1988), pp. 495-525. Biale writes that "the Chasidic movement introduced the most extreme anti-erotic values ever to appear in any Jewish texts, values that resemble, in some respects, the renunciations of sexuality preached by Christian monastics. Still more paradoxically, we find on the threshold of modernity one of the most widespread movements of sexual asceticism in Jewish history" (p. 21). 45. Biale, "Ejaculatory Prayer, p. 24.</page><page sequence="18">18 JUDITH R. BASKIN witchcraft in eighteenth-century Hasidism "was not novel but constituted a direct continuation of classical rabbinic and philosophical conceptions of women as more inclined to sorcery and witchcraft, more susceptible to ritual impurity, exhibiting a more intense and untamed sexuality and altogether representing the material-physical element of creation rather than the element of form or spirit."46 Certainly, the German-Jewish pietists, who take for granted the association of women with necromancy, who find sorceresses even within their own community of the pious,47 are one with other male ascetic movements in seeing women as representing impedimpents to mystical ascent. The pietist's desire for separation from the corruption of the material world, and his wish to displace the pleasures of human sexuality through his devotion to the divine, is built, in part, upon the objectification of women. That such spiritual options were simply not available or even imagined for Jewish women is, perhaps, the other side of the coin. Considering gender as a category of analysis demonstrates that the German-Jewish pietists go beyond rabbinic Judaism in their objectification of women, both in their efforts to limit illicit sexual behavior and because of their wish to elevate passion for the divine over the pleasures of human love. This is, in part, a consequence of their situation in a Christian milieu which preached the evils of carnality and the virtues of celibacy, while countenancing frequent encounters of all kinds between men and women. It is a reflection, equally, of the entire quality of German-Jewish pietistic spirituality, which saw quite clearly the correspondence between the desire evoked by women and the love demanded by God, and recognized the critical need to distinguish decisively between them.
