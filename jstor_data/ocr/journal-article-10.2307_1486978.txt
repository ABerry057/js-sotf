From one perspective, these "Other Jews" include all that are not Ashkenazi. But by the same token, in the strict sense of the word, not all Jews who are not Ashkenazi (as if Ashkenazi designated such a clear, monolithic entity) are Sephardi. Most appropriately, Sephardi refers to those who were expelled from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal) and their des- cendants in a far-flung diaspora that includes Western Europe, the New World, and especially the southern and eastern lands of the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans. Despite this strict usage, a clear definition of who is Sephardi has yet to be agreed upon by anthropologists, ethnographers, his- torians, and sociologists, not to mention in popular circles. Clearly, Persian, Bukharan, Kurdish, Yemenite, Iraqi, and Indian Jews do not neatly fit into the Sephardi category. Likewise, not all Moroccan, Algerian, or Tunisian Jews were genuinely Sephardi (that is, Iberian in origin), even when they defined themselves as such. There were Berber and Arabophone Jews in North Africa before the arrival of the various waves of megorashim, who referred to the former deprecatingly as berberiscos and forasteros, just as there were native Greek Jews of Hellenistic and Byzantine backgrounds- the so-called Romaniots-in Asia Minor and the Balkans before and after the coming of the Sephardim. Other terms used for non-Ashkenazim, such as "Easterners" or "Orien- tal Jews" (Mizrahim), are equally unsatisfying, not to mention downright ethnocentric. Daniel Elazar does not define the term "Sephardi," but rather succinctly states that "the labels of Westerner or Easterner or Oriental reflect certain assumptions with regard to culture and modernity" (p. 24). The introduction and the first two chapters (up to p. 69) provide primar- ily a fascinating account of Sephardim in Israel in the light of the elections and how they gained political and electoral power. The next five chapters (pp. 70-183) deal with Sephardim in Europe (including the Balkan area), Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Caribbean and Latin America, and finally North America. Basically, it is a survey of how they arrived there, how many they were then and now, their communal organizations, synagogues, Zionist aspirations, whether they were tolerated or persecuted, and outlook on future existence. This type of material, not available until now in such a con- veniently concentrated form, is very useful. Precise statistical data are not always available to Elazar; we are faced with such statements as: "Thou- sands moved to Eretz Israel"; "Tens of thousands . . emigrated to the Wes- tern Hemisphere" (p. 75); "Hundreds of thousands of Jews found a place</page><page sequence="3">366 BOOK REVIEWS for themselves between the Black Sea and the Adriatic" (p. 72); or "a sprin- kling of Spanish Jewish exiles reached Egypt" (p. 98). The strength of this book lies in its discussions of politics and social issues (not surprising, since the author is a political scientist), such as the case of the North African Jews and how they revived Jewish identity and open involvement in Jewish affairs in France. As Elazar aptly puts it: "The willingness of certain Sephardic Jews to make it clear to the powers-that-be that their vote is influenced by Jewish issues marks a radical departure from earlier Jewish patterns and has brought about a schism between them and leaders of the older community" (p. 86). The last chapter, "The Cultural Issue" (pp. 184-204), makes fascinating reading. The author recaptures his earlier subject synthesis and concludes, in his "Zionist Triumphalism as Ashkenazification" (pp. 185-189), that the Ashkenazic Zionist leadership sought to "civilize" the Sephardim at the expense of breaking traditional Sephardic culture and impairing their self- respect as well as that of their children. As a Sephardi or Oriental who grew up in Israel, I empathize with Elazar when he writes: "The list of such acts [prejudice, insults, horror stories] is long, and their recitation still infuriating" (p. 187). Elazar offers a tough, critical, and candid appraisal in "Sephardic Responsibilities" (pp. 201-204) when he points out that "the Sephardim too are responsible for their condition" (p. 201), and need "to overcome their parochial divisions" (p. 180). He praises the World Sephardi Federation and its president, Nissim Gaon, but, at the same time, criticizes the WSF's lead- ership for its lack of support "to institutions that would give the Sephardim recognition as contributors to the Jewish state and the Jewish people" and for programs "to help young Sephardim in Israel" (p. 201). One need only look at the growing number of endowed chairs in Judaic Studies in institu- tions of higher learning all over this country to understand Elazar's message. Or one can look at the annual meetings of the Association for Jewish Studies, and observe that out of some sixty panels, only one or perhaps two might deal with the theme Sephardim or Mizrahim. "Meanwhile, the Ashkenazification of Sephardim proceeds on all levels" (p. 203). On the negative side, this book has a somewhat apologetic tone that goes beyond merely setting the record straight vis-A-vis the Sephardim. The polemic against "Ashkenazic imperialism" sometimes seems to become Ashkenazi-bashing for the sake of catharsis.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 367 Elazar singles out Amos Oz's anti-Sephardic piece "Has Israel Altered Its Vision?" (pp. 5-6) and tears his argument apart, but is comforted when sometime later Oz visits a town heavily populated by North African Jews and changes some of his views. Elazar's harshest criticisms are aimed rightly at the Labor leadership. There are few points the present reviewer disagrees with. However, there are some oversimplifications and questionable judgments as well as ques- tions yet to be answered. These criticisms aside, the book is uniformly readable and interesting. It will certainly add to the growing literature on Sephardim-particularly in English, where the dearth of material is greatest. (Much more is available in Hebrew and French by contrast.) Yedida K.
