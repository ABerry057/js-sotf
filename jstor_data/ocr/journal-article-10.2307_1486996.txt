<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin Harshav. The Meaning of Yiddish. Berkeley: University of Califor- nia Press, 1990. xix, 205 pp. The Meaning of Yiddish attempts to "rethink and present to the intelli- gent reader some of the basic aspects of the culture of Yiddish" (p. xii). Who is this "intelligent reader"? He is not "the specialized scholar, and [the book] may repeat issues known to the Yiddish linguist or Jewish historian." Instead, the book is intended for "readers who bring to it no previous knowledge except for curiosity" (p. xii). Undoubtedly, the first part of Harshav's work speaks to this kind of reader. This is where he deals with the history of the Yiddish language, its peculiar nature as a fusion language, and its various sociological aspects. As the author intimates, the expert would, naturally, turn to Max Weinreich's monumental History of the Yiddish Language, and Uriel Weinreich's essays and Languages in Contact, for an in-depth study of these topics. The chapter "Semiotics of Yiddish Communication," and the second part of the book, dealing mainly with Yiddish literature, however, present some problems. Much as Harshav would like to target a large readership, he cannot help employing terminology only understood by literary theoreticians and semioticians. One would expect this from the editor of Poetics Today and Hasifrut, two strictly theoretical journals. This example comes from the opening of a subchapter of "Semiotics," called "Thematic Components":</page><page sequence="2">222 BOOK REVIEWS "The semiotics formed in a certain sociolinguistic culture contains a flexible cluster of attitudes and communicational signs and gestures" (p. 92). While the semiotics section is too technical for the layman, the chapters on literature-"The Modern Jewish Revolution," "The Historical Perspec- tive of Modern Yiddish Literature," "Yiddish Poetry in America," and "Introspection: A Modernist Poetics"-limit the arguments for a certain Yiddish rhetoric and aesthetics to Sholem Aleichem's Tevye the Dairyman and to modern (mainly Yiddish-American) poetry. True, the basically talmudic-influenced rhetoric in Sholem Aleichem is uniquely East Euro- pean, but side by side with this we find other aesthetic strands, such as the pro-Western European styles employed by I. J. Singer and Haim Grade. In itself, the analysis of Sholem Aleichem's classic is valuable; however, we should not build an entire poetics on this one work, while omitting the extraordinary achievements of fiction writers (such as the two mentioned above) who do not fit the scheme. Harshav does argue convincingly that the peculiar aesthetic of Yiddish literature stems largely from the dialectics of tradition-modernity, Jewish- universal, and Yiddish-Hebrew, and from bilingual or multilingual tensions as many Yiddish artists mastered more than one language. But, as alluded to, the paradigms are based chiefly on poetry-Yiddish-American poetry, to be exact, especially by M. L. Halpern, A. Leyeles, and Jacob Glatshteyn. We know that these and other great American Yiddish poets have already been covered at length in a book by Benjamin (and Barbara) Harshav, American Yiddish Poetry: A Bilingual Anthology (1986), a veritable classic in Yiddish letters. As evidenced in both works, Benjamin Harshav shows enormous erudition and a remarkable analytical eye when working with Jewish and European poetry. (In Israel he is known as a poet and translator of European poetry.) But literary history must also encompass drama and narrative fiction in all its forms. Thus, it is particularly disappointing to see that Yiddish drama and theater are missing from Harshav's analysis of "Yiddish, what was it?" (p. xii). One can hardly imagine Yiddish culture in the Old World, and perhaps even more in New York, without Goldfaden, Lateiner, Levick, Hirschbein, or Ansky, key theatrical figures, completely overlooked in Harshav's analysis. Also, the author of The Meaning of Yiddish only mentions, en passant, the contributions of religious Yiddish, while sarcastically remarking that the Lubavitcher Rebbe uses "as much as eighty to ninety percent ... phrases from the holy texts" (p. 21). I am sure the accuracy of these numbers could</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 223 be challenged, but it is an undisputable fact that among hundreds of thousands of religious Ashkenazi Jews, Hasidic stories and folklore were an important ingredient of daily life. Aside from sleight-of-hand statements such as the one quoted here, and occasional anecdotes, this vital aspect of Jewish life in Eastern Europe and America is likewise suppressed in the book. It is misleading to leave the impression that most Ashkenazi Jews were urban Lithuanian or Polish intellectuals, sitting around coffee houses in Vilna or New York and discussing symbolist and expressionist poetry. This is not the Yiddish world I know, and it is not the Yiddish world of multitudes of so-called proste yidn from rural Transylvania and Bessarabia. The Hasidic Rebbe and religious rituals were as important to them as Mal- larm6 and Baudelaire were to the young Yiddish poets of New York. These lacunae notwithstanding, The Meaning of Yiddish is unique in its conceptual approach, is daring in its scope, and should serve as an excellent introduction (especially the first part) for those "intelligent readers" seeking an entry into the fascinating world of Yiddish language, literature, and culture.
