Cincinnati, OH: Hebrew Union College Press, 2006. vii, 328 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001505 Gershon Shaked's discussion of literature is bound up with Israel as the only place in which Jewish life can exist: "But when the world of yesterday is destroyed, 471</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews whoever looks back, like Lot's wife, assures that his soul will never arrive in the promised land ... if one has fled the ruins of Sodom, there is no other place but here."1 This is also true for The New Tradition, a collection of essays that seeks to "illuminate key aspects of modem Jewish culture, especially for the non Hebrew reader" (11). A culmination-of-life project, this book explores different avenues in the emergence of modern Hebrew literature and demonstrates the tense and fruitful relationship among Israeli, Jewish, and non-Jewish (European, English, American) literature. The book is an enquiry into the axis of identity, language, and territory, as reflected within a new canon that "set in motion both the secularization of religious values and the sacralization of a revived Jewish nationalism" (1). Shaked tells the story of a literature that has been shaped and developed against the background of secularization processes in Europe since the eighteenth century and that later found its way to the Jewish national territory? the land of Israel. At the conclusion of years of creation and cultural renaissance that gave way to despair, disintegration, and decline in the wake of post-1967 emi gration ("without Israeliness it is difficult to be an Israeli") and the rise of orthodoxy, Shaked declares, "Israeli secularism has a right to exist" (27-28). This book, however, also tells the story of a deep fascination with the place of the "others," despite?and maybe because of?the claim that there is "no other place." Shaked's definition of "this new and secular Hebrew tradition" seems to chal lenge the Zionist revolutionary perspective that sought to save the secular from the sacred, the homeland from the Diaspora, and Hebrew from foreign languages. Thus, in the introductory chapter, Shaked refers to the debate on the influence of European literature on Hebrew literature, as can be seen most strongly in Bialik, Mendele, and Agnon, as well as in the influence of German writers such as Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe on the Hebrew writers of the Haskalah, or in Nietzsche's influence on Tcher nichowsky, Bardyczewski, and Brenner. At the same time, however, the following section of the book confirms a national metanarrative. By focusing on major cultural issues of "Jewish and Israeli modernity," the first chapters describe Israeliness as an honest attempt to create a stable culture within the "melting pot" and point to the formative role of the Holocaust on collective Israeli mentality, including an explora tion of the marginal place of Hebrew literature in the United States. The genres of drama (Shoham's use of biblical materials) and poetry?from Bialik's shape of mythical rebellion in his narrative poem The Dead of the Desert to Amichai's literary revolution that reflects the "experience of foreign literatures (Rilke and the new English poets)" (156)?constitute the core of the second section. Subsequent sections are devoted to Mendele and Agnon, "two major nove lists of the new tradition" (6). A comparative study of Dickens's Oliver Twist (1841, Russian translation) and Mendele's Book of Beggars shows how Mendele deprives his readers of the "happy end." Whereas Dickens teaches Vic torian society the lesson of rationality by reestablishing justice, rewarding victims, 1.

Victims of the fathers' crimes, they are evidence of that which was expelled and excluded from the traditional society, a testimony of repressed culture. The sons' testimony returns in the following comparative essay analyzing the work of Kafka and Agnon against the backdrop of the Habsburg Empire, the decline of faith, and the breakdown of the community life of the shtetl. Invok ing the crisis of fin de si?cle, political disintegration, and revolutionary forces that found expression in the rise of nationalist and antisemitic movements, Shaked argues that the fallen empire was an implicit object of nostalgia in the writings of Kafka and Agnon. He thus focuses on the use of paternal images as incarnations of political, religious, and biological authorities?an active and destructive power in Kafka and a detached force in Agnon that a prodigal son yearns to return to (219). Pointing to unique intertextual work, Shaked concludes that Agnon's treat ment of Judaism was even more ambiguous and conflicted than Kafka's and that his Zionist solution does not make this treatment any more unequivocal. And indeed, the intertextual relations become a major characteristic of the new tradition. Focusing on intertextuality in Deserted Wives, Shaked claimed that Agnon's work embodied the transformation of the sacred into the secular. However, the author is not a simple transmitter of a great lineage, "beginning with the Bible and continuing through the Mishnah, the Talmud, and all the works that stem from them" but rather "one that inherits a multi-textual tradition it can no longer carry on." The modern writer therefore serves as a secular substi tute for a sacred tradition, and his work is a secular chamber in which only the echoes of the canon are heard (245). The fifth section deals with two writers whose works appeared in 'erez yisra 'el after World War I: Breakdown and Bereavement by Brenner, one of the representatives of Hebrew literature in Russia before arriving in the Land of Israel who "liberated Hebrew from its linguistic shackles and from the cultural burden of Jewish history ... [he] made possible a secular language that was free to deal with everyday life" (311); and The Vengeance of the Fathers by Yitzhak Shami, who was born in Hebron and deeply rooted in its Islamic folklore and life style and who, as an "Arabic-Jew," perhaps wrote one of the first "Palestinian" novels, written, of all languages, in Hebrew (308). The discussion of an Arabic novel written in Hebrew is directly followed by another uncanny example of a German novel written in Hebrew, which concludes the book: The sixth and last section is dedicated to David Vogel, who learned from Brenner "the style of a pauper who makes do with bread and onions" (311). Shaked aims to show how Vogel's work integrates Viennese neo-romantic trad itions (Schnitzler, Zweig, Altenberg, Werfel, Roth) and the tradition of the metro politan novel (Doeblin, Joyce) with the Brenner tradition (the "uprooted man") that demonstrated the Russian influence (Dostoevsky) on Hebrew literature (312). Focusing on Married Life, he explores images of Western European deca dence and detached urban life, fascination with Christian traditions, antisemitic ideas, and perverse pleasure that finds its fulfillment in the sadomasochistic 473</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews relationship between an antihero and a femme fatale. Like other characters of mod ernist and post-1945 Austrian writers (Bernhard, Bachmann, Jelinek), Vogel's pro totypical hero is immune to the seductions of Vienna and is haunted by attraction and fear in search of the highest degree of anguish. For Shaked, this macabre plea sure is the bond that unites Austrian Jewish writers who did not emphasize their Jewishness in their writings and contributed to new "secular literature" whose only remaining vestige of Jewishness is its use of the ancestral language (323). Vogel, however, wrote in Hebrew, and his novel, even if only by negation, does give a glimpse into Jewish identity that was shaped by processes of "self-hatred." Gershon Shaked (1929-2006) was born in Vienna and immigrated to Israel in 1939 after the rise of Nazism. This biographical and cultural transition that influenced and shaped his oeuvre, both fiction (the novel Sons [Immigrants] appeared in 2001) and nonfiction, is also imprinted in his perception of the new tradition as a field of dynamic tensions: the secular that echoes the sacred, the Dia spora that reflects the homeland, and the foreign languages that reverberate with Hebrew. It seems that Shaked needed the "other place" in order to better under stand the only place of Hebrew literature. Michal Ben-Horin University of Florida Gainesville, Florida</page></plain_text>
