<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB by ROBERT EISEN Samuel ibn Tibbon (died ca. 1232) is best known as the translator of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. But as Aviezer Ravitzky has shown in his doctoral dissertation and in a series of recent articles, ibn Tibbon was an important thinker in his own right.' First and foremost, ibn Tibbon appears to have been the earliest significant interpreter of Maimonides' philosophical thought. He was also one of the most influential. While there had been suspicions, even during his lifetime, that Maimonides held radical esoteric philosophical views, ibn Tibbon was the first to lend sophistication to this viewpoint by developing an elaborate system of interpretation for 1.

Ibn Tibbon's significance was also acknowledged by George Vajda in his study of ibn Tibbon's Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim and its refutation by Jacob ben Sheshet in Recherche sur la philosophie et la Kabbale dans la pensee juive du Moyen Age (Paris: Mouton, 1962), pp. 14-31.

Ibn Tibbon's two major works are dedicated to this project. His Commentary on Ecclesiastes was one of the first commentaries written on an entire biblical book in light of Maimonides' philosophical teachings, while his Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim provided a similar type of commentary on various portions of the biblical text many of which had not been interpreted by Maimonides.4 2. The esoteric orientation of ibn Tibbon's interpretation of Maimonides is already evident in his early works: epistles, critical notes appended to his translation of the Guide, a glossary of philosophical terms, and introductions to his translations of Maimonides. But it is extensively developed in his two major works, his Commentary on Ecclesiastes and Ma'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim. Ibn Tibbon saw himself as one of the few interpreters uniquely able to comprehend Maimonides' esoteric doctrines, a claim that finds support in a statement by Abraham Maimuni, Maimonides' son, who testifies that his father considered ibn Tibbon a great sage and one who understood the secrets of the Guide; see Qoves Teshuvot Ha-Rambam Ve-'Iggerotav (Leipzig, 1859; repr. Jerusalem, 1967), vol. 3, p. 16. Even though ibn Tibbon's works were composed before the first major wave of the Maimonidean controversy in the 1230s, he shows awareness of the fact that the Jewish community since Maimonides' lifetime had been divided over his writings and that his reading of Maimonides would be criticized. In fact, they were, in particular by the Kabbalist Jacob ben Sheshet who attacked ibn Tibbon in his work Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim; see Vajda, Recherche sur la philosophie et la Kabbale. A comprehensive discussion of these issues can be found in Ravitzky, "Samuel ibn Tibbon." 3. Ravitzky, "Samuel ibn Tibbon," pp. 88. The influence of ibn Tibbon on thirteenth-century European and Italian philosophical exegesis is discussed extensively throughout Ravitzky's dissertation. 4. A key element uniting this school of philosophical exegesis was a theory developed by ibn Tibbon and adopted by subsequent interpreters regarding Jewish intellectual history, a theory designed to justify the writing of philosophical commentaries. Ibn Tibbon echoes the thoughts of previous Jewish philosophers, including Maimonides, in believing that philosophy was an esoteric tradition originating with the Jews. But ibn Tibbon took this theory in an original direction by giving an elaborate description of how the esoteric truths of this philosophical tradition had been gradually revealed from biblical times onward in response to the circumstances of various epochs in Jewish history. Ibn Tibbon saw Maimonides' Guide as</page><page sequence="3">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 265 Yet, despite the recognition that Ravitzky's work has brought to ibn Tibbon, relatively little work has been done on him. In this paper, it is my intention to bring attention to the richness and depth of ibn Tibbon's thought by analyzing a section of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim that deals with the book of Job. To my knowledge, this is the first time that a close reading has been done on a specific portion of this text.' Ibn Tibbon's discussion of Job constitutes a relatively small section of Ma'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, a mere seventeen pages in a treatise which extends to one hundred and seventy in the printed editions, and, therefore, it is not my intention here to provide a comprehensive understanding of ibn Tibbon's thought, or even of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, for that matter. However, the type of analysis I have chosen is, I believe, necessary to advance our understanding of this important treatise and thus ibn Tibbon's thought in general. To understand why this is the case, it should first be noted that Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim is ostensibly an inquiry into a problem in physics: why is the earth not covered in its entirety by water? According to medieval physics, earth is heavier than water and therefore should be submerged by the latter. What then explains the fact that large portions of earth poke out above the water and are in direct contact with air? But while this question is the stated purpose of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, it is largely made up of a series of loosely connected sections which analyze biblical passages from a philosophical standpoint. Only toward the end of the treatise does ibn Tibbon deal with the original problem, offering a solution that is by no means clear.6 Thus, Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim is not a systematic philosophical treatise, and any hope of understanding it will require analysis of its individual exegetical units. Our choice of format in this paper is therefore intended to address this very need. only the latest in a series of attempts to bring this tradition to light. See Ravitzky's discussion, ibid., pp. 108-116. 5. This treatise (hereafter cited as MYH) was edited--somewhat inadequately-by M. L. Bisliches (Pressburg, 1837). All citations will be from this edition. Ibn Tibbon's discussion of Job is contained in chapters 15-18, pp. 100-117. 6. The solution is discussed in MYH, pp. 133-135, 143-146. Neither Vajda nor Ravitzky attempts to tackle this difficult issue. A variety of interpretations of ibn Tibbon's views on creation can be found in medieval sources and are discussed by Ravitzky in "Aristotle's Book of Meteorology," pp. 244-250. Ibn Tibbon adopts an esoteric method of writing in order to conceal his true views which in this case appears to have been all too effective.</page><page sequence="4">266 ROBERT EISEN Another reason for limiting the scope of our inquiry to a specific section of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim is its mode of discourse. It is written in a difficult style that demands close and careful reading. In part this is due to the fact that ibn Tibbon emulates his teacher Maimonides in adopting an elusive and esoteric form of writing. It is for this reason that many of ibn Tibbon's basic philosophical positions remain to be clarified. While an analysis of any number of sections of Ma'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim would yield fruitful results, I have chosen to look at the portion on Job for two reasons. It is clear from his well-known letter to Maimonides regarding providence, written in 1199, that ibn Tibbon looked to Maimonides' reading of the book of Job in Guide 111:22-23 as key for revealing the latter's secret doctrine on providence. It is on the basis of his understanding of this section of the Guide that ibn Tibbon concludes that Maimonides supports an Aristotelian position regarding providence.7 Yet it is only in Ma'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, written no earlier than 1221, that ibn Tibbon provides his own detailed analysis of Job.8 Thus, by looking at this section of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, we will gain valuable insight into ibn Tibbon's own views on providence, an issue that seems to have preoccupied him throughout his writings. Moreover, we will also gain insight into the relationship between ibn Tibbon the interpreter of Maimonides and ibn Tibbon the independent thinker. In Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim, it is not always easy to figure out when ibn Tibbon is stating his own position or adopting that of Maimonides. Here we have an ideal opportunity to assess this question in that we have an earlier letter in which ibn Tibbon clearly spells out his understanding of Maimonides' position on Job. Thus, the question is whether ibn Tibbon in Ma'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim adopts Maimonides' reading of Job as he understood it or offers a new and original view. Before beginning the discussion, I would like to elaborate further on the difficulties of ibn Tibbon's style of discourse. As just noted, Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim as a whole is written in an esoteric manner reminiscent of that of Maimonides. This presents a number of challenges for deciphering ibn 7. This letter was published by Z. Diesendruck in "Samuel and Moses ibn Tibbon on Maimonides' Theory of Providence," Hebrew Union College Annual 11 (1936): 341-365. The book of Job is discussed by ibn Tibbon on pp. 355-356. 8.

There is not only the problem of figuring out what ibn Tibbon is saying on a given point in his discussion, it is also left to the reader to assemble these points into a coherent picture. Passages that are difficult to understand in earlier parts of his discussion are only clarified with the help of clues that emerge in later portions. This quality in ibn Tibbon's writing also makes it difficult for us to present his views, since in the explication of any one part of his exposition we must be aware of what he says elsewhere.' Another difficulty is that ibn Tibbon assumes that his reader is familiar with Maimonides' exposition of Job in Guide, 111:22-23, and that his reader's understanding of Maimonides is precisely the same as his own. He therefore does not always see the need to acknowledge those elements which he has adopted from his predecessor, or to explain how he has interpreted them. Yet, an understanding of how ibn Tibbon read Maimonides is at times crucial to comprehending him. The difficulty is only compounded by the fact that Maimonides' discussion of Job is one of the most impenetrable sections of the Guide-no small distinction given that this work as a whole is notorious for its difficulty.10 We will therefore proceed by summarizing ibn Tibbon's views on Job according to his order of exposition, but because of the interdependence of the different parts of his presentation, we will not be able to proceed in a completely linear fashion. We will also have to supply the pieces from Maimonides that ibn Tibbon co-opts into his own reading but does not always fully explain. 9. These difficulties are, in varying degrees, characteristic of Ma 'amar Yiqqavu Ha-Mayim as a whole. 10. A number of interpretations of Maimonides' reading of Job have been provided by modem commentators. The differences between them underscore the difficulty of interpreting this section of the Guide.

Kravitz, "Maimonides on Job: An Enquiry as to the Method of the Moreh," Hebrew Union College Annual 38 (1968): 149-158; Charles Touati, "Les Deux Th6ories de Maimonide sur la Providence," in Studies in Jewish Religious and Intellectual History, Presented to Alexander Altmann on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday, ed.

According to ibn Tibbon, Elihu expresses views on providence remarkably similar to those found in Psalm 73, a chapter that ibn Tibbon has just finished analyzing, and therefore an analysis of Elihu's remarks serves to reinforce ideas already developed.11 Yet, it soon becomes evident that while ibn Tibbon, in his exposition of Job, is mostly occupied with Elihu's views, his discussion effectively encompasses the entire book. The direction of ibn Tibbon's reading of Job is made clear from the outset. The central message of Elihu's speech, like that of Psalm 73, and the central point of the book of Job as a whole, is that immortality is "the most important component of providence" ('iqar ha-hashgahah).12 Job initially complained about the loss of material things because he knew God only through tradition; but when he came to know God with true knowledge, he realized that there was no value in these, only in immortal life: And Job in his final words admitted that he said what he said in his complaints and protests [only] on account of his lack of understanding and his lack of knowledge of those things much greater than him. This was because he did not know God except by virtue of what he had heard-that is, through tradition. But when he knew God and His ways through true intellectual knowledge ... he despised those goods which were "dust and ashes" and regretted that he protested against their absence and that he requested and desired them. This is [what he meant in] his statement: "Therefore I despise and repent of dust and ashes" (Job 42:6). The full meaning of the verse is as follows: "Therefore I despise dust and ashes, and I repent of having requested dust and ashes and of having protested when I was lacking dust and ashes."'3 Ibn Tibbon's views here can be fully understood only against the back- ground of Maimonides' reading of Job. According to Maimonides, Job's conception of divine providence went through a process transformation from the beginning to the end of the story: ... the latter [i.e., Job] said all that he did say as long as he had no true knowledge and knew the deity only because of his acceptance of authority, just 11.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 269 as the multitude adhering to the Law know it. But when he knew God with a certain knowledge, he admitted that true happiness, which is the knowledge of the deity, is guaranteed to all who know Him and that a human being cannot be troubled in any way by any of all the misfortunes in question. While he had known God only through traditional stories and not by way of speculation, Job imagined that the things thought to be happiness, such as health, wealth, and children, are the ultimate goal. For this reason he fell into such perplexity as he did.14 In this passage, we get clarification of ibn Tibbon's understanding of the evolution in Job's viewpoint, particularly with respect to the error in Job's initial position. For Maimonides, Job's initial complaints about his suffering were predicated on a traditional and erroneous view of God-in particular, the notion that divine reward and punishment are exclusively material in nature. It was only after Job graduated to a higher level of philosophical awareness that he realized that this view was incorrect and was therefore able to make peace with his situation."1 Ibn Tibbon's entire discussion assumes the same transformation in Job's outlook. Ibn Tibbon seems to depart from Maimonides, however, in seeing Job's higher philosophical awareness as consisting in the appreciation that true providence is immortality. But more on this later.16 Ibn Tibbon has yet to inform us what Job got to know about God that made him understand the centrality of immortality and how Job gained this knowledge. The answers to these questions are provided in the next chapter of ibn Tibbon's exposition, which focuses on Elihu's remarks in Job 33, a chapter which ibn Tibbon sees as key to the entire book. Again the influence of Maimonides is apparent here, since this chapter was also the central one for his reading of Job.17 But as we shall soon see, ibn Tibbon's reading of the chapter is not a simple reprisal of Maimonides' views. 14.

See the sources cited in n. 10 above for a range of views on this matter. 16. We might also note that the prooftext of Job 42:6, which is key for ibn Tibbon in the passage from MYHjust cited, was also of central importance for Maimonides.

Guide 111:23, pp. 494-497.</page><page sequence="8">270 ROBERT EISEN According to ibn Tibbon, Elihu, in the opening verses of Job 33, rebuts Job's claim that God has acted unjustly by inflicting suffering on him even though he had not sinned: He said to him-that is, Elihu to Job--regarding this complaint of his [i.e., Job's] that it was not justified and that it was not correct. He gave an explanation [for Job's suffering] by hint (be-remez) in order to refute it [i.e., Job's complaint] by saying "God is greater than man" [Job 33:12]. That is, God's ways are elevated above the ways of flesh and blood. If matters of this sort [i.e., unjust inflicting of suffering] are [considered] a corruption [of justice] in the ways of flesh and blood, it is not a corruption [of justice] in the ways of God, who is elevated above all elevated beings. For it is possible that suffering can come upon one who has not sinned against God, even if he acted according to His will. Do not understand from my words that God brings suffering essentially (be- 'esem) upon him who has not sinned and has acted according to His will-like the opinion of the Asharites and the Mutazilites [who believe this]; this was the opinion of Bildad and Zophar. Rather, they come upon him because of Satan-that is, by reason of some of the [celestial] intermediaries to whom He has surrendered man on account of his [being composed of] matter (homer)-that is, his body, not his soul, if he should want to preserve it. But the body is generated from corrupt matter, and [thus] one does not have the capacity to preserve it completely, not from complete dissolution nor from partial dissolution-that is, from suffering. [Thus,] there is no corruption [of justice] before God when He does not preserve [the body].'8 Elihu argues, according to ibn Tibbon, that Job was not correct in complaining to God about the injustice of his suffering because God's ways are unlike those of man. For human beings, the inflicting of undeserved suffering is injustice. But for God this is not the case. When God inflicts undeserved suffering on man, it is due to the fact that man is composed of corrupt matter that receives influences from God via the celestial world-here referred to as "intermediaries" ('emsa "iyyim--in such a way that matter constantly undergoes generation and corruption. It is thus matter, represented in the story of Job by the figure of Satan, which is actually responsible for man's suffering. Therefore, God's justice is vindicated because even though God is the ultimate cause of all events in the world below, suffering does not come from God "essentially" or by "first intention." The key proof-text is 18. MYH, pp. 101-102.</page><page sequence="9">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 271 Elihu's statement that "God is greater than man" (Job 33:12), which is taken to mean that in a concrete physical sense God's ways are "elevated above" those of human beings in that He is detached from the negative effects that He causes in the world below. A number of observations are in order here. First, in identifying Satan with matter, Ibn Tibbon clearly adopts what he believes to be Maimonides' view. In fact, this identification in Maimonides is not entirely certain. However, a good many commentators on Maimonides assume that, at least in the story of Job, he identifies Satan with either matter or privation, concepts closely related in his thinking on the nature of evil.19 Ibn Tibbon also adopts the related Neoplatonic view common among medieval philosophers that evil occurs because matter corrupts the essentially good emanations originating in God. But most important, we get a better picture here of Job's transformation-in particular, what it is that Job got to know about God which made him appreciate that true providence is immortality. Elihu teaches Job that undeserved suffering is possible because of man's material nature, which can receive influences from God that cause harm, and that this does not constitute any injustice on God's part. From this lesson, it would seem, Job comes to realize that the traditional model of divine reward and punishment in which he had believed is not correct. Physical well-being in no way reflects one's standing with God, and immortality must be the only true reward. 19. In fact, a good portion of Maimonides' discussion of Job is taken up by the figure of Satan (Guide 111:22, pp. 486-487). The commentators on Maimonides who believe that he connects Satan with matter or privation base themselves on his central discussion about evil in Guide 111:8-12, where he identifies privation and matter as explanations for the existence of evil. The two explanations appear to be closely related in that matter is the substratum for privation-though Maimonides never entirely clarifies the relationship. The full range of views on Maimonides' understanding of Satan are treated by Avraham Nuriel in his article "Towards a Clarification of the Concept of Satan in the Guide of the Perplexed" [Hebrew], Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986): 83-91. Nuriel recounts the theories of various commentators regarding the referent for Satan in Maimonides' thinking-including the identification of Satan with matter. Nuriel, however, offers his own original view in arguing that in his reading of Job Maimonides has two conceptions of Satan which are not necessarily related: Satan represents both chance occurrence and privation. Nuriel also takes up Maimonides' identification of Satan with the evil inclination, which is also mentioned in his exposition on Job and is based on a rabbinic source in B. T Bava Batra 16a. Maimonides appears to equate the evil inclination with the imagination. Nuriel argues, however, that this understanding of Satan seems to have no impact on his reading of the Job story (p. 91).</page><page sequence="10">272 ROBERT EISEN What also seems to be assumed here is that Job discovers the Maimonidean notion that it is intellectual perfection which is the avenue to true providence and immortality, and that his righteous behavior was not sufficient to bring such a reward. While ibn Tibbon does not make this idea explicit here, it is implied throughout his exposition.20 Moreover, he assumes that his reader is familiar with Maimonides' view which ties providential reward to the perfection of the intellect. Therefore, according to ibn Tibbon, Job underwent a transformation not only with respect to understanding what true reward is, but how it is that one achieves that reward. In the next section of the discussion, ibn Tibbon begins to explicate the most central part of Elihu's remarks, Job 33:14-31, which was of such importance to Maimonides. Here ibn Tibbon brings the foregoing issues into greater focus, but, even more important, takes his interpretation a crucial further by drawing out their implications. The important concept which emerges here is that not only does suffering of the kind that Job experienced fail to impugn God's justice, it is even a form of providence in its own right because it inspires one to recognize immortality as the final reward. How ibn Tibbon arrives at this interpretation will require some in-depth explication of what becomes an increasingly difficult exposition. According to ibn Tibbon, Elihu's remarks in verse 33:14 in effect introduce the central points which follow: "For God speaks once / And a second time-though [God] does not perceive it."21 Ibn Tibbon sees in this statement a reference to two aspects of providence: one by which God speaks to man in a manner which He "perceives," and another in a manner which God does not "perceive."22 Ibn Tibbon then proceeds to explicate these cryptic remarks. It is the second type of providence that becomes most important here for the issues central to Job. But let us first look briefly at the first type of providence. According to ibn Tibbon, the type of providence by which God communicates with man in a manner that God Himself "perceives" 20. See, for instance, MYH, pp. 114-115, part of which is cited below, p. 282. 21. My translations of the biblical text generally follow that of the New Jewish Publication Society version (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1985); however, in some instances I have made significant changes in order that the wording better reflect the meaning intended by ibn Tibbon. Here, for instance, the subject of the second clause is "God" rather than "man" in the NJPS translation because, as we will explain, ibn Tibbon understood the verse in this manner. The Hebrew original, in fact, is ambiguous here, since the impersonal subject of the clause is co-opted into the third-person masculine verb, yeshurenah. 22. MYH, p. 104.</page><page sequence="11">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 273 is none other than prophecy. This idea is inspired by the verses in Elihu's speech that immediately follow--"In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men, / While they slumber on their beds, / Then He opens men's understanding... "--which appear to confirm the common medieval philosophical association of dreams and prophecy. Ibn Tibbon tells us that Elihu is referring here to three different levels of prophecy which accompany different types of intellectual perfection. As ibn Tibbon explains, Elihu is referring to a rather specific type of prophetic communication, one which God imparts to a person like Job who is righteous in his deeds but who has not achieved intellectual perfection. God informs such a person through prophecy that suffering can even strike someone who exhibits righteous behavior, and He does so in order to quell any pride he might feel so as to preempt his belief that his actions protect him from suffering. Such a person is ignorant of the critical lessons that Job learned-namely, that a person of exemplary behavior is not protected from suffering. Thus, Elihu states in verses 16-17, "Then He opens men's understanding / And by disciplining them leaves His signature / To turn man away from an action / To suppress pride in man." What ibn Tibbon implies is that such an individual must be taught this lesson as a matter of discipline so that he might have incentive to pursue intellectual perfection and not dwell on the pride of his moral rectitude. If he takes this lesson to heart, he will be inspired to achieve intellectual perfection, which brings with it true reward-namely, immortality-a notion which ibn Tibbon appears to read out of verse 18, which follows: "He [i.e., God] spares his soul from destruction, / His life from perishing by the sword."23 But it is the second type of providential communication which God does not "perceive" that is most relevant to Job's situation. According to ibn Tibbon, the explication of this second type of communication is elaborated upon in Job 33:19-22, immediately after the verses dealing with prophetic communication: 19He is reproved by pains on his bed, And the trembling in his bones is constant. 20He detests food; 23. I translate the term shahat here as "destruction" rather than "Pit," as in the NJPS translation. The term "destruction" better signifies the loss of immortality to which ibn Tibbon is referring here.</page><page sequence="12">274 ROBERT EISEN Fine food [is repulsive] to him. 21His flesh wastes away till it cannot be seen, And his bones are rubbed away till they are invisible. 22He comes close to destruction, His life [verges] on death. Commenting on these verses, ibn Tibbon says as follows: ... after [Elihu] explained the first way by which God speaks to human beings essentially (be- 'esem) [which is] through the Active Intellect which overflows from Him, may He be exalted, by means of the prophet and wisdom, he began to explain the second way by which He seemingly speaks with human beings through chance occurrence (ki-mdaber 'im benei 'adam be-miqreh), as he says, "[God] does not perceive it." That is what [Elihu meant] in his saying: "[He is reproved] by pains on his bed." Thus, the order [of ideas] is as follows: "For God speaks once / And a second time-though [God] does not perceive it /. .. In a dream, a night vision etc.," and by painful chastisements. He speaks [in one way] to them by dream and night vision. The second [way}-by which He seemingly speaks, though He does not perceive it-is by means of painful chastisements which come upon man. The intent is that God seemingly speaks to human beings in this manner by chance occurrence; that is, suffering and pain come upon them by means of Satan.24 Ibn Tibbon explains that the allusion to reproval by "pains" in verse 14 is a reference to suffering which occurs by means of Satan-i.e., matter. In such instances, God "seemingly speaks to man by chance occurrence." Yet God "does not perceive it" in that He does not perceive the evil effect which His goodness has on the world below on account of the corrupting influence of matter. Thus, ibn Tibbon tells us, the undeserved suffering which can afflict the righteous is in fact providential in that it is a way by which God indirectly communicates with them. What is actually communicated is not yet made clear, but it is obvious from the context of the discussion and becomes more explicit in the course of ibn Tibbon's subsequent remarks. The recipient of undeserved suffering learns essentially the same lesson as the one who receives prophetic communication of the sort ascribed to the first type of providence: the traditional conception whereby God rewards and punishes by 24. MYH, p. 105.</page><page sequence="13">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 275 physical well-being is incorrect, only immortality is true providence, and the latter follows from intellectual perfection. In sum, there are two types of providential communications which Elihu refers to in the central part of his remarks that both teach the notion that immortality is true providence, not physical well-being, and that the only way to achieve this type of providence is through intellectual perfection, not just perfection in one's actions. The first type is through prophecy by which God directly imparts this information. Hence, Elihu's reference to God "perceiving" this type of providence, for here prophetic communication comes "essentially" from God via the Active Intellect. The second is the actual experience of suffering itself which teaches the same lesson, only more indirectly. Here God does not "perceive" the communication He imparts because He does not cause evil as a matter of first intention.25 Thus, Job's suffering is precisely this second type of providential communication. It was his suffering that prodded him to a higher philosophical awareness of the nature of ultimate providence and the means to achieve it. Suffering is therefore providential in that it leads to an awareness of immortality which is the highest form of providence. But ibn Tibbon has much more to say in a series of lengthy remarks that follow about the process of education by which someone goes through the type of transformation Job experiences.26 This section is perhaps the most difficult of ibn Tibbon's entire exposition, for it is here that ibn Tibbon's desire to conceal his views is most evident. This portion of ibn Tibbon's commentary is devoted to explicating Elihu's remarks in Job 33:14-31, which according to ibn Tibbon describe why it is that a man experiences undeserved suffering. 23If there be an angel,27 An advocate, one among a thousand To declare a man's uprightness, 24Then He has mercy on him and decrees, "Redeem him from descending to destruction, For I have obtained his ransom; 25. As we will later argue, both forms of providence imply that ibn Tibbon conceives of God in impersonal terms. 26. MYH, pp. 106 f. 27. Again, I have departed from the NJPS translation by translating mal'akh as "angel," which is the way ibn Tibbon understands the term, rather than "representative."</page><page sequence="14">276 ROBERT EISEN 25Let his flesh be healthier than in his youth; Let him return to younger days." 26He prays to God and is accepted by Him; He enters His presence with shouts of joy, For He requites a man for his righteousness. 27He [i.e., the righteous man] declares to men, "I have sinned; I have perverted what was right; But I was not paid back for it." 28He redeemed him from passing into destruction, He will enjoy the light. 29Truly God does all these things Two or three times to man, 30To bring him back from destruction, That he may bask in the light of life. Ibn Tibbon identifies three crucial factors in this section which are connected to the type of providential communication which manifests itself in suffering: (1) the angel who saves the individual in verse 23, (2) prayer to God referred to in verse 26, and (3) repentance and confession of one's sins to other men alluded to in verse 27. A discussion follows as to the nature of the exact relationship between the three factors. Ibn Tibbon concludes that while the salvation of the angel is a prerequisite for the other two, the reverse is not the case. At this point in his discussion, it is not at all clear what ibn Tibbon is saying. We do not know how any of these factors are connected to providence or what they have to do with the notion that the suffering of the righteous is a communication from God. Particularly unclear is the identity of the angel which ibn Tibbon considers a central factor here. Ibn Tibbon discusses the angel in deliberately ambiguous terms because he believes it refers to an esoteric doctrine that cannot be openly explained. Now according to ibn Tibbon, Elihu offers clues that reveal the angel's true identity. Commenting on verse 33:23, "If there be an angel, / An advocate, one among a thousand. .. ," ibn Tibbon tells us as follows: after he [i.e., Elihu] concealed [the identity of] this one angel [in not telling us] from which species of [the many] species which are equivocally called angels</page><page sequence="15">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 277 [this angel] belongs-he pierced the settings and said "among a thousand." That is, this one [angel] is from the angels that are in the thousands.28 The reference to piercing the settings is an allusion to Maimonides' well- known interpretation of Proverbs 25:11-"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver"--which Maimonides sees as an allusion to the dual level of meaning in Scripture, with the apples of gold and settings of silver representing, respectively, Scripture's inner philosophical meaning and its plain outer meaning. The notion that Elihu pierces the settings by identifying the angel as one "among a thousand" therefore means that this phrase offers significant clues regarding the inner philosophical meaning of the angel and raises our hope of understanding ibn Tibbon's interpretation here. However, as one reads through ibn Tibbon's commentary, it is evident that ibn Tibbon himselfhas not sufficiently pierced the settings for his readers. In his commentary, ibn Tibbon seems to deliberately conceal the identity of the angel which in various passages could refer to the Active Intellect, the human intellect, or some other cosmological force beneficial to the individual. But besides the general adoption of Maimonides' esoteric method of discourse here, ibn Tibbon's tendency to obfuscate is inspired by Maimonides in at least two other ways. First, the term "angel" is highly equivocal in the philosophical vocabulary of Maimonides in that it can refer to a wide range of natural forces.29 Ibn Tibbon is therefore clearly exploiting that ambiguity. Second, in Maimonides' own exposition of Elihu's speech in particular, the angel is also a focal point for discussion, and Maimonides' explication of the term is just as cryptic, if not more so, than that of ibn Tibbon.30 Thus, here again, ibn Tibbon seems to have followed Maimonides' lead in concealing his views. 28. MYH, pp. 105-106. 29. Angels are dealt with in a number of places in the Guide. But Maimonides' most important programmatic statement about the equivocal nature of this concept is in Guide 111:6, pp. 261-265, especially p. 262. 30. A wide variety of views have been given regarding the identity of this angel. I will mention the views found among modem interpreters of Maimonides which were cited in n. 10 above. Kravitz equates the angel with the Active Intellect. Touati also equates the angel with the Active Intellect but gives a reading different from Kravitz on other details of Maimonides' exegesis. Raffel argues that the angel is the practical intellect. Levinger takes the position that the angel is the perfected human intellect as a whole.</page><page sequence="16">278 ROBERT EISEN Rather than work through all the relevant passages in order to determine the referent of Elihu's angel, I would like to go directly to one crucial passage which I believe provides key clues not only on this matter but on the entire direction of ibn Tibbon's discussion. In a section which follows shortly after the one we have just examined, ibn Tibbon shares a series of thoughts that begin with a criticism of Maimonides: ... it would seem that the Rabbi, the true teacher [i.e., Maimonides], believed that the mercy and redemption in the salvation of the angel, the prayer of the one chastised, his entering God's presence with shouts of joy, his declaration to men [that he has sinned]--are all to be understood as one [matter], as in our first explication.3' For he did not mention from that whole matter anything other than the salvation [of the angel]. [It was] as if he understood the other things [i.e., prayer and repentance] as only a "setting," not that one would truly need them. It is true that it [i.e., the salvation of the angel] is the essential thing because it is a hint regarding necessary individual providence which exists for the [physical] bodies of animals; it is this [providence] which is alluded to in chapter 15 of the third part [of the Guide of the Perplexed], as he says, "the individuals of every species are not neglected in every respect." But there is no doubt that the verses "He prays to God" (Job 33:26) and "He declares to men[, / I have sinned]" (Job 33:27) are not for concealment alone, in that they are the central element of the second way by which God seemingly speaks to human beings, not by salvation [of the angel], as we have said; for in them [i.e., prayer and repentance] there appears to be some manner of guidance (he 'arah) for the one chastised to explore the reasons for his pains, deficiencies, and sins, until he understands them. It is as if God spoke to him and informed him of them [i.e., the reasons]. It would appear that it was about this that the sage [i.e., Elihu] intended to inform Job. Sometimes, through chastisements good things come upon the one chastised by chance occurrence. For on their account [i.e., chastisements] he will be guided to that of which he had been ignorant; they are like a spoken statement to him and are providential for him by chance occurrence. Therefore, one should not protest regarding them given that they are the cause of something good.32 Ibn Tibbon claims that Maimonides also understood the importance of the three factors in Elihu's remarks-the angel, prayer, and repentance. But 31. A reference to an earlier section of ibn Tibbon's discussion, MYH, p. 106. 32. Ibid., p. 108.</page><page sequence="17">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 279 he takes issue with Maimonides for placing all of the emphasis on the angel and not on the other two factors: prayer and repentance. Ibn Tibbon is referring to the fact that in Maimonides' exposition of Elihu's speech in the Guide, only the angel is mentioned as key to the latter's message-not prayer or repentance.33 Ibn Tibbon assumes that Maimonides interpreted Elihu's mention of prayer and repentance as a smoke-screen to conceal an esoteric doctrine regarding the angel. What ibn Tibbon is saying here is not of great help until the next few lines, where he provides crucial information not only about his differences with Maimonides, but his own position as well. Ibn Tibbon states that the angel in Elihu's speech is a "hint regarding necessary individual providence which exists for the [physical] bodies of animals" alluded to in Guide III: 15, where Maimonides notes that "the individuals of every species are not neglected in every respect." Now in fact the reference is mistaken; the clause cited from Maimonides appears in chapter 17, and the wording of ibn Tibbon's own translation matches his citation there.34 What is most interesting is that the section from which this citation is taken is Maimonides' description of Aristotle's theory of providence according to which all species are protected only by general providence, there being no special providence for man. A key clue to ibn Tibbon's views has therefore been revealed. What ibn Tibbon is saying here is that, according to Maimonides, Elihu's speech conceals an esoteric doctrine that the righteous man is saved from his suffering only by general providence as defined by Aristotle, not by a personal God. Elihu's angel in Maimonides' exposition is therefore nothing other than general providence. Moreover, as ibn Tibbon would have it, Maimonides reads Elihu's remarks about prayer and repentance as references designed only to appease the traditional view that salvation comes from the response of a personal God. Maimonides, in fact, does not see any efficacy in either. We should note that ibn Tibbon's understanding of Maimonides here comes as no surprise. The same conclusions are drawn in ibn Tibbon's earlier letter to Maimonides regarding providence. There he also interprets Maimonides as upholding an esoteric Aristotelian position on providence, and sees Maimonides' reading of Job as key evidence for this conclusion.35 33. Guide 111:23, p. 495. 34. Standard traditional Hebrew editions of the Guide, III: 17, p. 23b. 35. Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses ibn Tibbon," p. 356. This is an issue which we will be discussing at greater length below.</page><page sequence="18">280 ROBERT EISEN But most important for our purposes is that in discussing Maimonides' position, it becomes clear what ibn Tibbon's own view is. It is apparent that he too assumes that Elihu's angel represents general providence. But he disagrees with Maimonides about the role of prayer and repentance which are also mentioned by Elihu. For ibn Tibbon, prayer and repentance do indeed serve a crucial function in that they provide inspiration for the one who experiences unjustified suffering "to explore the reasons for his pains, deficiencies, and sins until he understands them." As such "they are the essence of the second way by which God seemingly speaks to human beings." Through prayer and repentance "it is as if God spoke to him and informed him of them." The pieces of the puzzle now fall into place. According to ibn Tibbon, when the righteous man experiences unjustified suffering, he is inspired to offer prayers to God and confessions to other human beings which serve the purpose of causing him to explore the meaning of his suffering. What he discovers is what ibn Tibbon has already told us: Physical suffering is caused by the corrupting influence of his material body and not by any direct intentional action on God's part; thus, there is no value in material well-being; and one must cultivate intellectual perfection to achieve immortality, which is the only true providence. The role of the angel also becomes clear. The angel, or general providence, is apparently needed to save the righteous man from his suffering--at least physically; otherwise he could die and gain no benefit from his newfound philosophical insights regarding true providence. After all, he must now embark on the path of intellectual perfection in order to be worthy of that providence. Thus, the salvation of the "angel" in combination with prayer and repentance lead one to appreciate that the ultimate providential reward is immortality and to eventually experience it. The entire process is initiated by suffering which turns out to be providential in leading him to these truths. Ibn Tibbon also informs us that this whole process can occur more than once in the lifetime of an individual, a point derived from Elihu's subsequent remarks: 29Truly God does all these things Two or three times to man, 30To bring him back from destruction, That he may bask in the light of life.</page><page sequence="19">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 281 Commenting on the statement that God performs this salvation "two or three times," ibn Tibbon says as follows: ... this chastisement and this causing of pain after which there is the salvation of the angel, as well as mercy and redemption-God enacts for man two or three times. That is, there are those for whom one [experience of suffering] is enough, and through it they recognize their deficiencies and corruptions. But there are those who do not recognize [this] with one [experience of this sort], and require two or three [experiences].36 Thus, someone may undergo suffering and the salvation of general providence a number of times before gaining proper philosophical insight from his experiences. The following passage nicely paraphrases ibn Tibbon's understanding of the key section in Job 33: If there is an angel advocating on his behalf, he will save him from those afflictions. He will know, either after he is saved from them or before he is saved, what had escaped him [previously]. He will know in himself a deficiency that he did not know beforehand. He will eventually know what the cause was of that which affected him. He will feel as if God spoke to him and informed him of what he did not know beforehand. He will be saved from destruction because of that knowledge, for he will know what the truth of providence is which will not be lacking in him who is worthy of it. Thus, it was called "the second way" of God's speaking with human beings so as to inform them of His way. And yet, He does not perceive nor see that way [of communication].37 We should note incidentally that this passage is properly understood only when one assumes that the angel represents general providence. We mentioned above that many of ibn Tibbon's references to the angel are ambiguous, and that in some places the angel could be interpreted as an allusion to the Active Intellect or the human intellect. After all, these entities also have a role in "saving" the individual who experiences suffering by providing him with philosophical insights into his situation that lead him to appreciate immortality as true providence. The passage here shows that ibn Tibbon could not have interpreted the angel in this way. Ibn Tibbon states clearly 36. MYH, p. 109. 37. Ibid., p. 110.</page><page sequence="20">282 ROBERT EISEN that the philosophical insights which such an individual gains are "before" or "after" he is saved by the angel. Thus, the salvation of the angel and the philosophical insights which the righteous person gains while suffering are by no means synonymous. In a summary at the end of his exposition in chapter 17, ibn Tibbon reiterates his reading of Job but also gives us a better understanding of the individual for whom the lessons of providential suffering are specifically intended. Ibn Tibbon tells us that the person who stands to benefit from unjustified suffering is the righteous individual, like Job, who is righteous in his actions but has not yet achieved intellectual perfection. If such people were never to experience suffering, the following consequence would result: ... they would consider themselves perfect individuals because they had not sinned in their actions and had performed good deeds. They would know God and His ways according to tradition and would not be aroused [to knowledge] of anything beyond this. They would not achieve the perfection intended for them in knowing God and His ways according to the true knowledge that is possible for man to know. They would remain in their [state of] deficiency.38 Ibn Tibbon thus emphasizes that perfection in one's actions is not only inadequate for achieving true providence, it can even be a hindrance by giving one a false sense of security that God will reward such an individual for his righteous behavior. Ibn Tibbon goes on to explain that Job was such an individual and through suffering was inspired to reach a higher understanding of God. What we learn here is that unjustified suffering is beneficial for a rather specific group of people: those who are righteous in terms of their good deeds but have a traditional and erroneous view of God, and need to be aroused to a higher philosophical understanding of God in order to achieve intellectual perfection. While ibn Tibbon has implied all along that such a person is the focus of his discussion, it is here that the description of this individual is most explicit. And again the influence of Maimonides is evident, for he too characterizes Job as an individual who initially achieved moral, not intellectual, perfection.39 However, ibn Tibbon appears to give a new twist to 38. Ibid., pp. 114-115. 39. Guide 111:22, p. 487. Maimonides is clearly picking up on the cue in the very opening line of Job, which describes him as "blameless and upright," one who "feared God and shunned evil" (Job 1:1) but makes no reference to his intellectual achievements.</page><page sequence="21">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 283 Maimonides' thinking by stating that moral perfection is not only inadequate for helping the righteous individual like Job achieve intellectual perfection but can even be an obstacle because it provides an individual of this sort with a false sense of security that he will be rewarded for his actions. Cryptic references cited earlier are now cleared up as well. Now we understand why ibn Tibbon stated that the salvation of the angel could occur without prayer and repentance, but not the reverse.40 For salvation through general providence can occur regardless of whether one prays or repents, since the latter activities only provide the opportunity to explore the philosophical meaning of one's suffering. But without the salvation provided by general providence, the righteous man might not physically survive his suffering, and thus the philosophical insights gained from the introspection inspired by prayer and repentance would be of no value. Another cryptic reference to the angel in this section now makes sense as well. We noted above that when ibn Tibbon first speaks about the angel, he focuses on Elihu's description of this angel as one "among a thousand," stating that this phrase is a crucial clue as to what it represents. Given that we now have good reason to think that the angel represents general providence, ibn Tibbon's allusion is transparent. Ibn Tibbon is subscribing to Aristotle's views on general providence as described by Maimonides, and in the latter's description of Aristotle's position, general providence expresses itself in any number of ways in that all natural endowments in the various species are an expression of general providence. Thus, general providence safeguards animals, for instance, through providing the faculty of locomotion in order to seek out what is beneficial to them and to flee from what is harmful. Human beings are protected by the intellect in that each person, with the help of the intellect, "governs, thinks, and reflects on what may render possible the durability of himself as an individual and the preservation of his species."41 Therefore, when an individual is saved by general providence in a given instance, he is rescued by one of a "thousand" natural capacities that the latter supplies to the many species. We can now begin to draw some general conclusions about ibn Tibbon's reading of Job. What is perhaps most significant is that ibn Tibbon is consistent in describing providential processes that do not assume a personal God. God exercises providence only in the sense that He is the ultimate source of 40. See above, p. 276. 41. Guide III:17, p. 465.</page><page sequence="22">284 ROBERT EISEN general providence, which is synonymous with the natural order. The latter is providential in that it is responsible for the chance events that cause suffering, suffering that in turn allows the righteous individual to discover what true providence is. The natural order is also providential in saving the righteous person from physical demise so that he can make use of the philosophical lessons he has learned from his suffering. Prayer and repentance serve an important role but only to force the individual to contemplate why he has suffered and come to the philosophical realization that physical well-being is of no value. There is no suggestion here that God responds personally to either. In general, ibn Tibbon believes he is in agreement with Maimonides, who he believes also upholds Aristotle's views on providence. It is for the purpose of concealing these truths that ibn Tibbon considers Elihu's angel to refer to an esoteric doctrine that he cannot openly discuss. The righteous person who suffers is only saved--at least physically-by general providence, not by a personal God, a view which obviously clashes head-on with the traditional notion that a personal God rewards and punishes, and does so with material rewards in this lifetime. As ibn Tibbon tells us, Elihu at one point conceals this doctrine in such a way that the philosophically unsophisticated reader will think that he is referring to the traditional view. The key passage in Elihu's speech, which is deliberately designed to address both the philosophically adept audience as well as those who subscribe to traditional views, is Job 33:23-4: 23If there be an angel, An advocate, one among a thousand To declare a man's uprightness, 24Then He has mercy on him and decrees, "Redeem him from descending to destruction, For I have obtained his ransom ... " The exoteric reading is that an angel saves man from destruction (v. 23), but that God is the ultimate cause of his rescue (v. 24), a reading that assumes that God has a personal role to play in the process. But ibn Tibbon notes that the "He" in verse 24 is ambiguous and should be read according to the esoteric meaning as a reference to the angel, not God. Therefore, it is only the angel</page><page sequence="23">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 285 which saves man, not God. Translated into philosophical terms, this means that only general providence saves man; there is no divine intervention here.42 In his discussion of prayer and repentance and their roles in the prov- idential process, ibn Tibbon at times appears to be speaking in traditional terms. But a close reading of key passages reveals that this is not the case, and that once again his esoteric style of discourse is meant to conceal his radical position. For instance, in the passage in which ibn Tibbon deals most extensively with prayer and repentance, he says as follows: ... he who is rescued by prayer [offered] to God after he has aroused himself to the [knowledge of the] first cause of his pains and all matters in the lowly world-his prayer will be considered as righteousness and will rise up as appeasement before God. .... He who is saved after confession of his sins and recognition of his deficiencies and his corruption, has been aroused to [the knowledge of] more than that to which those [mentioned] above have been aroused.43 For he has also been aroused to the intermediary causes and ultimate [causes], that is, to all the elevated beings that are above him.44 He has also been aroused to the deficiency of the recipient [i.e., man] and his corruption.45 Note how ibn Tibbon avoids any clear reference to personal divine intervention here. Now he does state that prayer will "rise up as appeasement before God," but even here ibn Tibbon shies away from speaking of God as actually listening or responding to prayer. The emphasis is on prayer and repentance as means to teach man about philosophical truth regarding the corrupting influence of matter. For this reason, ibn Tibbon goes on to say in the same passage that repentance is in fact more effective than prayer in leading one to true knowledge, because it allows the individual to probe the issue of suffering 42. MYH, p. 106. The esoteric reading would therefore require that the upper-case H in my translation be converted to lower-case. Ibn Tibbon notes that other commentators have opted for the exoteric reading, an observation that is borne out by looking at how Rashi and ibn Ezra deal with the same passage. Our understanding of ibn Tibbon helps make sense of a highly cryptic passage in which ibn Tibbon has more to say about this section of Elihu's speech; see MYH, pp. 108-109. 43. The reference here is to one who responds to suffering by prayer or one who has been saved by the ange--i.e., general providence-cases discussed previously by ibn Tibbon in his exposition of Job 33:14-31. 44. The reference here is to the Separate Intellects. 45. MYH, p. 107.</page><page sequence="24">286 ROBERT EISEN and come to an understanding of how his own deficiencies as a material being and the celestial world are the cause of his suffering. Prayer merely acquaints him with the "first cause," i.e., God, who is responsible for all events in the world.46 As we noted earlier, Ravitzky expresses the suspicion that ibn Tibbon's God is impersonal.47 Here we seem to have confirmation of this view. Yet we must resist drawing a comprehensive conclusion about ibn Tibbon's philosophical orientation. Ibn Tibbon's reading of Job gives us a limited perspective on his views on providence because it is concerned only with a certain type of person--one who is righteous in action but not intellectually perfect, and a specific type of providence--that which involves suffering. That ibn Tibbon did not consider his reading of Job to be a comprehensive assessment of providence is evident from a statement in chapter 18 in which he takes note of other forms of providence in addition to the one dealt with in Job. Some of these other types of providence are "natural" (tiv'iyyot), which "are the result of the different types of angels that God commands so as to preserve man"; some are "according to choice and free will" (behiriyyot resoniyyot); finally, there are "miraculous" forms of providence (moftiyyot), which are only for select individuals.48 Thus, we cannot conclusively say that ibn Tibbon believes that God acts in an impersonal manner for all forms of providence. Of especial interest is the question of miracles which ibn Tibbon mentions here. Ibn Tibbon identifies this last form of providence with that which Maimonides discusses in Guide 111:51, but adds that he will address this last issue in a later work--though there is no evidence that he ever did.49 Still, even if firm conclusions cannot be drawn here, the suspicion that ibn Tibbon adhered to an impersonal conception of God is greatly strengthened by our exposition of his interpretation of Job. 46. Ibid. The reference to God here as "first cause" of events in the world below, including suffering, also has philosophically suggestive overtones for the astute reader. This phrase calls to mind Aristotle's Prime Mover, who is the impersonal source of all events in the universe. We may also note that the first type of providence referred to by Elihu, by which the righteous person receives prophecy guiding him to understand that material rewards are of no value, is also presented in highly naturalistic terms. If one looks carefully at ibn Tibbon's wording in his description of this form of providence, he actually refers to prophecy and wisdom interchangeably, as if to imply that prophecy provides the same message as philosophical wisdom attained without any direct communication from God. See MYH, pp. 104-105. 47. Ravitzky, "Samuel ibn Tibbon," pp. 118-119. 48. MYH, p. 117. 49. Ibid.</page><page sequence="25">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 287 We must now ask a crucial question: how does ibn Tibbon's understanding of Job compare with that of Maimonides? This question is not easy to answer, given that Maimonides' reading of Job is difficult to decipher. Still, I believe that we have enough of a general sense of Maimonides' understanding of Job that a number of conclusions can be drawn. First of all, what is clear is that ibn Tibbon's reading of Job is in many respects a commentary on Maimonides. Ibn Tibbon accepts the basic features of Maimonides' reading of Job as well as the philosophical positions that underlie it, at least as ibn Tibbon understands them. The following is a list of the basic ideas that they share in common, most of which we have already noted: 1. Job is a man who has achieved moral but not intellectual perfection, and believes, due to his lack of understanding of philosophical matters, that divine reward and punishment are entirely this-worldly in nature. He therefore becomes disillusioned about God's justice when he experiences suffering, since his behavior has been blameless. But by the end of the story he rises to a higher philosophical understanding of reward and punishment that allows him to make peace with his situation. 2. The figure of Satan who afflicts Job represents matter. Maimonides never in fact makes this equation explicit, but many commentators feel this is a plausible reading of Maimonides. Undoubtedly, ibn Tibbon believes that this is Maimonides' view. 3. The crucial passage that unlocks the secrets of Job is Elihu's speech-in particular chapter 33. Ibn Tibbon equates Elihu's angel with general provi- dence, believing that it is Maimonides' own position.50 This last point requires further elaboration. A close examination of ibn Tibbon's remarks on Job reveals that Maimonides' focus on the angel may not have been the only feature in his reading of Elihu's speech that influenced ibn Tibbon. Maimonides mentions at least two new ideas which are unique to Elihu's position as compared to the opinions of Job's other friends. One is the intercession of the angel, which has already been discussed. The other is Elihu's description of "the how of prophecy .. .'51 Here Maimonides 50. Another point in common is that the different opinions of Job's friends represent different schools of thought regarding providence. In one passage cited above, p. 270, Bildad and Zophar are identified with precisely the same schools of Islamic theology that Maimonides associates with them. 51. Ibid.</page><page sequence="26">288 ROBERT EISEN refers us to Job 33:14-5, where Elihu appears to refer to prophecy when he states, "For God speaks once / And a second time-though man does not perceive it. / In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men, / While they slumber on their beds." Maimonides' remarks here are unusually opaque. Yet what is relevant for our concerns is that ibn Tibbon appears to have tried both to make sense of these remarks and to co-opt them into his own reading. As we saw earlier, ibn Tibbon believes that Elihu discusses two types of providential communication regarding suffering. One is the actual experience of suffering of the kind that Job underwent in which the individual learns about the nature of true providence, while the other takes the form of prophecy whereby God informs an individual of the very same lesson. Perhaps the latter form of providential communication represents ibn Tibbon's understanding of Maimonides' reference to the "how" prophecy. One other component of Maimonides' remarks on Job 33 may have had an influence on ibn Tibbon. After noting the new ideas which Elihu adds to the discussion in Job, Maimonides adds a rather mysterious observation: Thereupon he [i.e., Elihu] begins to confirm this opinion and to make clear its method by describing many natural circumstances, such as his describing thunder, lightning, rain, and the blowing of winds. He combines this with many subjects belonging to the circumstances of animals-I mean an outbreak of pestilence referred to in his dictum, In a moment they die, even at midnight, and so on [Job 34:20]; the occurrence of great wars referred to in his dictum, He breaketh in pieces mighty men without number, and setteth others in their stead [Job 34:24]; and many other circumstances.52 In this difficult passage-which, incidentally, few commentators have at- tempted to explicate-Maimonides refers to Elihu's description in Job 34:20 f. of "natural circumstances" and "many subjects belonging to the circumstances of animals," such as their vulnerability to pestilence as factors which help "to confirm" Elihu's opinion and "to make clear its method." It is not hard to imagine how these remarks might have been understood by ibn Tibbon. He could have easily interpreted Maimonides to be referring to general providence, which cares only for the species and not the individual. Thus, it would have been plausible for ibn Tibbon to conclude that here Maimonides 52. Guide 111:23, pp. 495-496. The translation of verses from Job here follows that of Pines.</page><page sequence="27">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 289 hints at an esoteric doctrine according to which the righteous who suffer are saved by general providence alone and not a personal God. This is not to say that ibn Tibbon's reading of Maimonides is the only possible reading; but it is certainly a legitimate one. It is not implausible that Maimonides, in his reading of Job, is, in fact, forwarding an esoteric view on providence and that it is precisely the one ibn Tibbon is suggesting. However, a full assessment of Maimonides' position on providence and its relationship to his comments on Job would require an examination far beyond the scope of this paper. Yet, while there are instances in which Tibbon clearly adopts Maimonides' positions, in other instances he believes he is adopting Maimonides' views but in fact takes a position quite different from that of the Master. The most important example of this tendency is ibn Tibbon's view that the central message of Job is that immortality is true providence. We have concrete evidence that ibn Tibbon saw this as Maimonides' view. In his letter on providence to Maimonides in 1199, he says so quite explicitly. The focus of the letter is on the perplexity which ibn Tibbon had regarding the inconsistencies in Maimonides' presentation of providence in the Guide-in particular, the contradiction between Guide I1:17-24 and III:51. Ibn Tibbon surmises that Maimonides' position on providence in the earlier chapters is an esoteric one identical with that of Aristotle. Providence consists in immortality, which is consequent upon intellectual perfection. As for this lifetime, one is "protected" from suffering because the awareness that true providence is immortality provides one with psychological immunity from one's afflictions. But ibn Tibbon goes on to say that in Guide 111:51, Maimonides seems to take a different position by depicting providence as coming from a personal God who interacts directly in the human world. What is most important for us is that in the course of this discussion, ibn Tibbon spells out his understanding of Maimonides' views on Job. Ibn Tibbon sees Maimonides' interpretation of Job as key evidence for the latter's esoteric doctrine on providence. According to ibn Tibbon, Maimonides' reading of Job is as follows: ... after Job knew the Creator with true knowledge he was not concerned about those felicities which are imagined to be felicities, such as health, wealth, and children. The intent is that he was not concerned about what happened to him after he knew about immortality....</page><page sequence="28">290 ROBERT EISEN ... after he knew the Creator, he did not value money and it was thought of lightly by him. Similarly, his illnesses and disease were thought of lightly by him after he verified for himself the existence of an ultimate perfection and the immortality of the soul on account of it. ... It seems to me that Aristotle agrees with this view; indeed most philosophers do, especially those who believe in immortality.53 Thus, ibn Tibbon claims that for Maimonides the central message of Job is that immortality is true providence.54 Ibn Tibbon does not provide information to explain why he read Mai- monides' exposition on Job in this way. However, there are some clues in Maimonides which may help explain ibn Tibbon's interpretation. For one, Maimonides indicates that Job achieved knowledge of God through negative theology and love of God on account of his misfortunes, qualities that appear to be prerequisites for immortality.55 It is also important to note that, according to Maimonides, Job loses faith in reward in the afterlife on account of his suffering and comes to believe that "there is no hope after death."56 Therefore, ibn Tibbon may have inferred from these remarks that 53. Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses ibn Tibbon," pp. 355-356. 54. We should note that in the letter, ibn Tibbon goes on to describe another facet of providence in Maimonides' esoteric doctrine which is equated with the workings of nature. All events in nature are the product of natural laws implemented by God, including the actions of man, which are controlled by his intellect. Hence, providence over man also expresses itself in the very existence and activity of the human intellect which helps protect man from harm. See ibid., p. 357. Both facets of Maimonides' esoteric doctrine on providence are adopted by ibn Tibbon in his reading of Job. The notion that true providence is immortality becomes the centerpoint of ibn Tibbon's own interpretation of Job. The other aspect of providence is reflected in ibn Tibbon's notion that the natural order, identified with the "angel," has a crucial role to play in saving the righteous person from harm and allowing him to discover what true providence is. See Ravitzky, "Samuel ibn Tibbon," p. 94, who also mentions the two aspects of providence in ibn Tibbon's reading of Maimonides. 55. There are in fact very few references to immortality in the Guide. However, there are a number of passages which indicate that Maimonides saw intellectual perfection as a prerequisite for immortality. Perhaps the most explicit is a passage in Guide 111:54, p. 635, where Maimonides states that the acquisition of "rational virtues" leads one to achieve "permanent perdurance," an obvious reference to immortality. Love of God, which is described primarily in Guide 111:51, appears to enhance one's chances for immortality in that it is an intense emotional connection to God one cultivates after achieving intellectual perfection that allows for easy separation of the soul from the body at the point of death. See especially, Guide 111:51, pp. 627-628. 56. Guide 111:22, p. 492.</page><page sequence="29">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 291 when Job underwent his transformation and graduated to a more sophisticated philosophical awareness at the end of the story, Job's belief in the afterlife was reinstated. Yet, if ibn Tibbon saw himself as adopting Maimonides' views by identifying immortality as the central message of Job, it is doubtful that this was in fact Maimonides' position. The thrust of Maimonides' reading of Job is quite clearly that Job achieves knowledge and love of God, and while these might lead one to immortality, Maimonides in no way suggests that the equation of providence with immortality was included in Job's education. There are still other instances where it is clear that ibn Tibbon departs from Maimonides, but does so quite consciously. In all such cases, Ibn Tibbon's differences with Maimonides are not about basic philosophical issues, but exegetical ones." Ibn Tibbon will therefore quarrel with Maimonides about what kinds of philosophical lessons are to be learned from Job, but not about the philosophical lessons themselves. Most of the disagreements are about relatively minor concerns. For instance, we noted one such instance above with respect to Elihu's reference to prayer and repentance in Job 33. Ibn Tibbon feels that Maimonides does not properly appreciate the role of these factors in Elihu's message." Another instance which we have not mentioned is a lengthy disagreement that ibn Tibbon has with Maimonides regarding the philosophical lessons that one learns from the different references to Satan in the first two chapters of Job.59 However, there are at least two instances in which ibn Tibbon's differences with Maimonides are of a more fundamental nature. First, a key philosophical lesson which ibn Tibbon reads out of Job is the notion that suffering can 57. A similar point is made by Ravitzky with respect to ibn Tibbon's views on creation. Here too ibn Tibbon"s differences with Maimonides are exegetical and not philosophical. See Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Book of Meteorology," pp. 239-244. 58. See above, p. 278. 59. MYH, pp. 110-114. Ibn Tibbon is also apologetic about disagreeing with Maimonides but claims that one must speak the truth as one sees it. I chose not to discuss this part of ibn Tibbon's presentation because it does not seem essential to his understanding of the story. Ibn Tibbon also disagrees with Maimonides on how to read Job 33:29, in which Elihu states that the angel rescues someone "two or three times." According to ibn Tibbon, Maimonides reads this statement as saying that the angel saves a man only three times in his life, given that no human being escapes from death. Ibn Tibbon argues that Job, being well aware that all men die, did not need to learn such a lesson. Instead, Elihu is teaching Job that the angel can come and save a man any number of times, the number three having no significance here. See MYH, pp. 109-110.</page><page sequence="30">292 ROBERT EISEN be providential in that it forces one to recognize that immortality is true providence. Now this view may have been inspired by Maimonides, since Maimonides sees Job's suffering as leading him to the discovery of exalted philosophical truths and love of God. However, Maimonides never explicitly draws out from Job the notion that suffering is a providential force, while for ibn Tibbon this idea becomes one of central importance in his reading. I am therefore inclined to think that on this point, ibn Tibbon is departing from Maimonides in his interpretation of the Job story. Moreover, it is a departure that is significant given that the equation of suffering with providence becomes a basic feature of ibn Tibbon's interpretation.60 Ibn Tibbon also departs from Maimonides about one other important matter that I believe points to a basic difference in how they conceived of 60. In fact, one might argue that in this instance ibn Tibbon goes against Maimonides--even philosophically. In Guide III:17, Maimonides rejects the rabbinic concept of "sufferings of love" (yisurin shel 'ahavah), which claims "that misfortunes befall an individual not because of his having sinned before, but in order that his reward should be greater" (Guide III: 17, p. 471). The reason Maimonides cannot accept his idea, which he sees as similar to that of the Mutazilites, is that it is nowhere found in the Torah. Maimonides goes on to adopt the view that he feels is that of the Torah-namely, that good and evil befall human beings on account of their past actions, not because of any reward they might receive in the future (ibid.). However, in all likelihood ibn Tibbon believed that his views had little to do with those that Maimonides had criticized, since Maimonides argues specifically against rabbinic and Mutazilite views which see God as bringing suffering deliberately as a means to grant future reward. Ibn Tibbon, unlike the rabbis or the Mutazilites, does not see providence as a force coming from a personal God-at least not the type which manifests itself with suffering. In fact, ibn Tibbon brings out the distinction between his views and those of the Islamic theologians explicitly in a passage cited earlier. In explicating Elihu's remarks, ibn Tibbon adds the following: "Do not understand from my words that God brings suffering essentially (be-'esem) upon him who has not sinned and has acted according to His will-like the opinion of the Asharites and the Mutazilites [who believe this]; this was the opinion of Bildad and Zophar. Rather, they come upon him because of Satan--that is, by reason of some of the [celestial] intermediaries to whom He has surrendered man on account of his [being composed of] matter (homer)-that is, his body, not his soul, if he should want to preserve it" (MYH, pp. 102-103, cited above, p. 270). Ibn Tibbon seems eager to point out that his views differ from those of the Islamic theologians, Asharites and Mutazilites, because they believe that suffering comes "essentially" from God, while he does not. But even if ibn Tibbon is not disagreeing with Maimonides here on fundamental philosophical issues, by arguing that the equation of suffering with providence is a major theme in Job, ibn Tibbon is drawing an important philosophical lesson out of Job that is not present in Maimonides' reading.</page><page sequence="31">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 293 the actual figure of Job. Maimonides strongly suggests that by the end of the story Job achieves intellectual perfection in that Job learns negative theology, the highest form of understanding of God that human beings can have, and that Job achieves love of God, an emotional tie to God that only comes with perfection of the intellect. Maimonides also accepts the biblical text at face value in assuming that Job experienced prophecy in the final chapters; at the end of his discussion, Maimonides refers explicitly to Job's "prophetic revelation."''61 From a philosophical standpoint, it would also make sense that Job receives prophecy, given that in Maimonides' thinking intellectual perfection is the key prerequisite for this capacity. Ibn Tibbon, it would seem, has a markedly different view on these matters. He consistently maintains that Job learns the value of intellectual perfection as a means to immortality, but there is no suggestion that he ever actually achieves intellectual perfection himself. While ibn Tibbon never says this explicitly, it is strongly implied. In a striking interpretation, ibn Tibbon claims that in the final chapters of Job God never actually spoke to Job, at least not directly. Instead, He spoke to him indirectly in the sense that He caused him to suffer. As we saw earlier, ibn Tibbon believes that suffering is a divine communication of sorts in that it teaches valuable philosophical lessons about the true nature of providence. The important question is what motivated ibn Tibbon to come up with this interpretation. Ibn Tibbon hinges his reading on a novel understanding of the "whirlwind" (se'arah) out of which God spoke. For ibn Tibbon, the whirlwind here is the whirlwind of Job's "many chastisements." It was through these afflictions that God "spoke." Ibn Tibbon bases his reading on the observation that in no other place in the Bible does God speak to anyone in a prophecy described as a whirlwind, an indication that here some other form of communication occurred.62 But this exegetical explanation alone does not account for what is clearly a reading that goes against the plain meaning of the biblical text as well as the reading of Maimonides upon which ibn Tibbon is so dependent. My own view is that there is a simple philosophical reason for ibn Tibbon's view; Job did not achieve prophecy because he did not have intellectual perfection, which is a necessary prerequisite for prophecy. We can make sense of ibn Tibbon's position by pointing out a philosophical problem in Maimonides' reading of Job. Maimonides sees Job as a figure 61. Guide II1:23, p. 496. 62. MYH, p. 115.</page><page sequence="32">294 ROBERT EISEN who initially has only moral perfection, but by the end of the story achieves intellectual perfection as well. The question that seems to have been on ibn Tibbon's mind is how Job in fact achieved this latter perfection. Maimonides consistently depicts the process of philosophical education as a long and laborious one; and yet there is no indication on Maimonides' part as to how and when Job went through this process. In fact, if we take the story at face value, it would seem implausible that Job would have become intellectually perfect after a few-albeit lengthy--conversations with his friends. I would like to suggest, therefore, that ibn Tibbon was moved by these considerations to posit a reading that is much more realistic from a philosophical standpoint: Job simply did not achieve intellectual perfection but only an appreciation of its value as a prerequisite for immortality. He therefore did not experience prophecy. Now Maimonides might have replied to the philosophical objections raised here that the story of Job, as a parable, is an imaginative story that teaches us valuable philosophical lessons, and therefore one should not be troubled too much by the literal account here which depicts Job's achievement of intellectual perfection in an unrealistic span of time. Yet ibn Tibbon seems to have felt that there should be a close relationship between the allegory and that which is feasible from a philosophical standpoint. But how then does ibn Tibbon deal with the last chapters of Job, in which the mystery of God's ways are extolled? Maimonides' notion that Job learns about the most exalted of philosophical truths-i.e., negative theology--may be problematic in terms of his own philosophical principles, but at least it is a faithful rendering of the text. Maimonides' negative theology, after all, posits that God's essence cannot be known, a notion that fits well with the message of Job's final revelation. Ibn Tibbon view makes more sense philosophically, but leaves him with the task of explaining what was actually conveyed to Job in the final chapters and how it fits with his theory that God only spoke to Job through his suffering. What is odd is how little ibn Tibbon says about the final chapters of Job. With the exception of his brief remarks about the whirlwind, he has virtually no comment about them, a lacuna that can only give one pause. This may indicate some discomfort on ibn Tibbon's part as to how to fit these chapters into his overall reading of Job. Yet I believe that if one reads ibn Tibbon carefully, an interpretation of the last chapters of Job is at least implied. As we have already seen, ibn Tibbon maintains that in the course of the story Job does in fact discover a negative theology of sorts: God's ways</page><page sequence="33">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 295 are not like ours, since God, unlike human beings, can cause people to suffer without injustice being attributed to Him-this, on account of the corrupting influence of matter. This notion was a key component of Elihu's remarks to Job. Now ibn Tibbon never explicitly connects this point to the final chapters of Job. And yet it is not hard to imagine how ibn Tibbon might have made such a connection. After all, in these chapters God emphasizes the mystery of His ways, a message that ibn Tibbon could have easily interpreted as confirming the notion that God's justice is unlike that of human beings. And, of course, ibn Tibbon has already told us that this is the message that Job learned from his suffering, suffering which is identified with the whirlwind. The final chapters, therefore, repeat what we already know from Elihu's speech: God's ways are unlike ours in terms of how he metes out justice. If this interpretation is correct, it may also explain why ibn Tibbon does not explicate the last chapters; he may have believed that they did not add anything to Job's philosophical education and assumed that their meaning was transparent from his exposition of Elihu's speech. It is important to note, however, that the negative theology which Job learns in ibn Tibbon's reading is quite different from that found in Mai- monides. In fact, technically it is not really negative theology at all, at least not as Maimonides understands it. Certainly, according to ibn Tibbon, Job discovers that there are differences between God's ways and ours. But the knowledge which Job learns about God's ways is quite positive in content in that he is told how God, unlike man, can inflict suffering without our attributing injustice to Him. Negative theology in the Maimonidean sense would not allow this type of positive description. Thus, for Maimonides, when Job learns about negative theology in the final revelation, he learns that God's ways are ultimately unfathomable. Furthermore, it must be noted that for ibn Tibbon, what Job discovers is that God's ways are not like ours on one very specific issue: God's justice. There is no suggestion by ibn Tibbon that Job comes to a far-reaching understanding of God's negative attributes, as implied by Maimonides. These observations lend further support to our contention that ibn Tibbon does not attribute intellectual perfection to Job. What Job discovers is an important, but limited, series of philosophical truths that help him appreciate that true providence is not to be equated with physical well-being. This understanding of Job contrasts sharply with that of Maimonides, who depicts Job as a figure who in the end achieves intellectual perfection, experiences</page><page sequence="34">296 ROBERT EISEN prophecy, and learns philosophical truths about God that are the most exalted that a human being can understand. And yet it is interesting to note that despite ibn Tibbon's differences with Maimonides here, nowhere does ibn Tibbon indicate that he has departed from his predecessor--even though he is quick to note such differences regarding other more minor points. To summarize, ibn Tibbon gleans a number of philosophical lessons from the book of Job. The most important one is that true providence is immortality, which is consequent upon intellectual perfection. This lesson in turn allows ibn Tibbon to find meaning in the suffering of the righteous. Suffering leads a righteous individual to recognize that immortality is indeed true reward. It accomplishes this purpose by causing him to realize that his afflictions are the result of the corrupting influence of matter. From this insight, he comes to understand that providence does not consist in physical well-being, and that true providence is achieved in the afterlife. He also comes to understand that it is intellectual perfection which is needed to achieve true providence, not just perfection in one's actions. In short, unjustified suffering teaches what true reward is and the means to achieve it. Yet ibn Tibbon seems to feel that suffering benefits righteous individuals of a rather specific sort: those who have achieved perfection in their actions but not in their intellect, and who believe that their actions will bring divine reward. It is they who will be disillusioned by their suffering, seek a philosophical explanation for their situation, and come to the conclusions just outlined. Job serves as an example of someone who learns these lessons. He begins the story as a man righteous in conduct but lacking in intellectual perfection and expecting physical rewards for his righteous behavior. By the end of the story he has learned that true providence has nothing to do with such rewards, and that true providence is immortality, which is consequent upon the perfection of the intellect. Our analysis has allowed us to make some valuable observations about ibn Tibbon's philosophical orientation. In ibn Tibbon's exposition, providence in its various manifestations functions as a force that does not require a personal God. Immortality is achieved by natural means through the perfection of the intellect. When the righteous individual suffers, what saves him physically from demise is general providence that is synonymous with the natural order. Prayer and repentance are valuable, but only to force such an individual to reflect upon his situation and gain the philosophical insight that will inspire</page><page sequence="35">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 297 him to pursue intellectual perfection. One cannot conclude with certainty that ibn Tibbon believed in an impersonal God for all providential activity, since his exposition of Job deals with providence of a rather specific variety. Still, these observations lend support to such a conclusion. We also have learned from our analysis that ibn Tibbon's relationship to Maimonides is complex in that he straddles the boundary between interpreter and innovator in dealing with Maimonides' views. Ibn Tibbon bases his understanding of Job on Maimonides' exposition, and in some respects provides a keen and astute commentary on the latter. However, ibn Tibbon's exposition of Job ends up being far more elaborate and coherent than that of Maimonides. He makes use of clues in Maimonides' exposition to formulate a reading of Job that goes well beyond that of his predecessor. Ibn Tibbon also departs from Maimonides in significant ways. These differences do not involve basic philosophical positions, but are concerned with the question of which philosophical positions are contained in the book of Job. Thus, for example, ibn Tibbon, unlike Maimonides, sees Job as teaching us that suffering is providential in leading us to appreciate that true providence is immortality. Most important is ibn Tibbon's interpretation of the final chapters of Job. Ibn Tibbon offers the novel interpretation that Job does not experience prophecy, a view which appears to be based on ibn Tibbon's assessment that Job did not achieve intellectual perfection. Job merely gets to the point of appreciating the importance of intellectual perfection as a means to immortality on account of the "whirlwind" of suffering which he experiences. This is a significant departure from Maimonides, who clearly regards Job as a figure who achieves intellectual perfection and prophecy by the end of the story. To complicate matters, we also found one significant instance in which ibn Tibbon believes he is following Maimonides but is in fact formulating his own original view. Ibn Tibbon thinks he is adopting Maimonides' position in claiming that the central message of Job is the identification of true providence with immortality; and yet there is little evidence to suggest that Maimonides read Job this way. I would like to ask one final and basic question: Did ibn Tibbon give any consideration to the audience for whom the book of Job was intended? In particular, is the story of Job understood to be of universal significance in dealing with a problem that plagues all of humanity? Or is its message for a specifically Jewish audience? This latter option is certainly feasible, given</page><page sequence="36">298 ROBERT EISEN that suffering was both a historical reality and a theologically charged issue for the Jews in ibn Tibbon's time. A cursory reading would support the first alternative. Throughout his exposition, ibn Tibbon appears to present the story of Job as one of universal significance, there being no explicit mention of the suffering of the Jews. Moreover, in one particular passage the universality of the story seems to be underscored. I am referring to a brief discussion in chapter 18 where ibn Tibbon presents his final remarks about Job. Here ibn Tibbon gives a number of examples of the type of providence mentioned by Elihu by which God communicates to righteous individuals through prophecy and informs them of the same lessons that Job learned through the actual experience of suffering.63 Because this form of providence was not in fact the type that Job experienced, ibn Tibbon does not have much to say about it in the course of his commentary on Job. But in the closing remarks of his discussion, ibn Tibbon gives three examples from the Bible in which God warns individuals through prophecy of their erroneous views concerning providence: these are Laban, Abimelech, and the Pharaoh with whom Abraham interacted regarding his wife Sarah. What is most interesting to note here is that all of these individuals are non-Jews. Ibn Tibbon seems to be calling on these specific examples to underscore the universal quality of the teachings which the book of Job imparts. We should also note that most rabbinic commentators assume that Job is himself a non-Jew.64 While ibn Tibbon never declares a position on this matter, he may have held the same opinion, and therefore felt that to call on non-Jewish examples was most appropriate in illustrating one of the lessons which Job learns. But if one looks carefully at ibn Tibbon's reading of Job, I believe that there is evidence that through the figure of Job he is also grappling with the plight of the Jews of his own period. We have noted that ibn Tibbon saw the message of Job as being directed to a rather specific group of individuals. They are righteous people who believe erroneously that divine reward is to be equated with physical well-being, and that one achieves that reward by good deeds; such people have to be taught that they are wrong on both counts. I think it is evident that ibn Tibbon is addressing and critiquing the community of traditional Jews in his own day who meticulously observe the commandments but are ignorant of philosophy. The pejorative references 63. See above, p. 273. 64. A lively debate on this question is recorded in B.T. Bava Batra 15a-b.</page><page sequence="37">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON ON THE BOOK OF JOB 299 to those who do good deeds, and see no need to pursue philosophy unless they are prodded by the experience of suffering, seem to be an unmistakable allusion to his pious but philosophically unsophisticated co-religionists. In effect, ibn Tibbon is telling us, they are like Job before his enlightenment. Moreover, he seems to be saying that if the Jews are experiencing suffering, it should only inspire them to seek intellectual perfection, which will in turn bring providence. Effectively, what ibn Tibbon suggests is that the solution to the predicament of the persecuted Jewish community is the study of philosophy!65 Admittedly, what is being argued here is somewhat speculative. But our argument is strengthened by evidence that ibn Tibbon was troubled by the lack of philosophical sophistication in the Jewish community of his period. As Ravitzky has pointed out, in his Commentary on Ecclesiastes, ibn Tibbon expresses concern that most of his co-religionists either reject Maimonides' views or accept his views only after they have distorted them. In fact, ibn Tibbon sees himself as one of the select few who truly understands Maimonides' teachings.66 It would therefore make sense for ibn Tibbon to direct criticism at his fellow Jews for their lack of philosophical learning and to express his thoughts indirectly through an interpretation of Job so as to avoid a backlash from entrenched traditionalists. What we have said here may be true for Maimonides as well. His exposition of Job also makes no specific reference to the Jewish people and appears to teach lessons of universal importance. Yet it is he who inspires the more particularistic dimension of ibn Tibbon's interpretation of Job as a figure who initially believes in traditional views of divine reward until he is disabused of these beliefs through a higher philosophical understanding. Therefore, if ibn Tibbon's reading of Job reflects his views on the Jewish community of his time, he is perhaps following the lead of Maimonides. However, ibn Tibbon goes a step further than Maimonides on several points. For, as noted earlier, ibn Tibbon emphasizes through the figure of Job that the life of righteous action is not just inadequate for achieving providence, as Maimonides suggests, but is a serious hindrance to true providence in that it provides a sense of false confidence that one will be rewarded for proper 65. The notion that the study of philosophy is prerequisite for the redemption of the Jewish people from exile is also voiced by other medieval Jewish philosophers. See, for example, Jacob Anatoli's Malmad Ha-Talmidim (Lyck: Mekisei Nirdamim, 1866), p. 160b. 66.. Ravitzky, "Samuel ibn Tibbon," pp. 89-90.</page><page sequence="38">300 ROBERT EISEN action alone. Thus, ibn Tibbon's implied critique of his pious co-religionists is sharper than in Maimonides. More important, we also noted that ibn Tibbon goes beyond Maimonides in deriving from Job the notion that suffering is a providential force in its own right, one that can lead the naively righteous to true philosophical awareness and true divine reward. Maimonides stops short of making suffering into a manifestation of providence. Therefore, ibn Tibbon may be grappling with the meaning of Jewish exile and suffering in a way that Maimonides does not. I think our analysis shows that without doubt ibn Tibbon is a thinker with significant depth and subtlety. It has also become clear that one cannot appreciate these qualities unless one is prepared to read him with great care. One must have patience and perseverance in order to unlock the meaning of his elusive and esoteric style of writing. We certainly have not found that ibn Tibbon offers original philosophical positions--and perhaps this is one reason that he has been so little studied. But to look for his originality in this sphere is to miss ibn Tibbon's true talent, which lies in his capacity as philosophical exegete, a form of discourse that requires its own unique skills. Only when this point is properly appreciated can one understand ibn Tibbon's significance and why his works were so influential on subsequent Jewish philosophers who were interested in biblical interpretation.
