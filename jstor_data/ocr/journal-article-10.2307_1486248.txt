Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Allanheld, 1983. xi, 305 pp. Rabbinic literature has always been regarded as a gold mine for the reconstruction of the intellectual and spiritual history of the rabbis and their academies, but the society of which the rabbis were a part has rarely received the attention it deserves. In this work, Martin Goodman uses rabbinic literature to portray Galilean society from the Bar Kokhba Revolt until the edict of Caracalla of 212 C.E., which granted citizenship to all free inhabi- tants of the Roman Empire. Faced with the problem of utilizing rabbinic sources for historical purposes, Goodman advances his own methodology, which seeks to uncover the assumptions behind the legislation of the rabbis. Goodman is clearly cognizant of the pitfalls of extrapolating seemingly relevant material from rabbinic sources and adopts a somewhat conserva- tive approach to deal with the problem. The author confines his attention to the contemporary, tannaitic evidence and even here excludes from consi- deration baraitot appearing in later, amoraic collections. The assumption is that the Mishnah, Tosefta, and most tannaitic Midrashim (Goodman is cautious where the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael is concerned) reflect condi- tions in second- and early-third-century Galilee. As Goodman puts it, "There was no point in inventing homilies and laws about everyday life unless that life was recognizably that of the audience" (p. 7). The stories of the rabbis are given credence when they contain circumstantial details and especially when they are presented in ma'aseh ("It happened that...") form. In the latter case, Goodman argues that the tannaim had no "motive for invention," since theoretical rulings by a sage would have been just as authoritative. When the tannaim do not consider a given subject, and it can 249</page><page sequence="2">250 BOOK REVIEWS be shown that their silence is not the result of disinterest or lack of concern, it is presumed that the matter is irrelevant to a discussion of Galilean society. Goodman adopts J. Neusner's method of correlating earlier and later attributions when dating is a concern. He also notes the importance of "geographical context" in evaluating attributions and surveys the relevant external, literary, and archeological sources. The earlier part of Goodman's work includes chapters on "Settlement and Population," "Jews and Gentiles in Galilee," "Galilean Village Trade," and "Galilean Village Culture." Goodman is at times innovative; for example, when he cautiously uses information gleaned from sixteenth- century Turkish tax registers in his discussion of settlement and population patterns. His survey of relations between Jews and Gentiles leads him to the tentative conclusion that "there was close contact with gentiles not within Galilee itself (which the Christian writers deny), but on the borders of Galilee where no clear geographical frontier can be postulated" (p. 43). Goodman's chapter on village culture contains the following noteworthy observations: (1) While the rabbis of Lower Galilee may have used Greek because it was in use among at least part of their audience, the language appears to have constituted "only a thin strand in the linguistic cloth" (p. 68). (2) The mixture of Greek and Oriental elements found in Galilean art and architecture is similar to that found in Syria, suggesting that "his- torians search in vain for deliberate acceptance or rejection of Hellenism" (p. 70). (3) Though educated Galilean Jews may not have been proficient in Greek philosophy, "they were still quite prepared to act as Greek philo- sophers did" (p. 74), disputing in the marketplaces and teaching ethics in their midrash. (4) The synagogues of second- and third-century Galilee, which served as houses of worship with a "central liturgical function," evolved out of an earlier institution devoted to public Torah readings and secular purposes. The most interesting section of this work is that devoted to "Govern- ment and Law," which includes chapters on "Rabbinic Authority in Galilee," "Local Administration in Galilee," "Roman Administration," and "Conflicts of Jurisdiction." Goodman studies rabbinic case law in order to determine the extent of the rabbis' influence over Galilean society. While the Sabbath, circumcision, sexual purity laws, use of tefillin, and consump- tion of kosher meat enjoyed widespread observance, the Galilean Jews seem to have been less committed to scrupulous adherence to the minutiae of purity and tithing halakhah. The preoccupation of the tannaim with the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 251 ammei ha-are; suggests that rabbinic authority was rather limited during this period. Nor were civil and criminal cases decided by the rabbis but rather by the local Jewish courts whose judges need not have been clergy. Life went on with little interference fom the rabbis (control over the calen- dar being an exception), whom Goodman compares to the Roman iuris- prudentes, who "spent their time codifying the law as they saw it, inventing problems to solve according to the principles they evolved from these laws, adding a strong element of what they would like the laws to be and making the results known to the nonacademic public. And like that of the Roman iurisprudentes, their advice was sometimes followed and sometimes, perhaps more often, not" (p. 127). Though Roman administration was "loosely applied" and the Jews for all intents and purposes managed their own affairs, the potential for conflict between the three existing court systems i.e., Roman, polis or village, and rabbinic, existed and, according to Goodman, is assumed by the tannaim. All in all, rabbinic jurisdiction diminished after the Bar Kokhba Revolt and did not begin to recover until the end of the tannaitic period. Goodman arrives at this conclusion after finding that there are only six cases (out of sixty) of the tannaim exercising jurisdiction after the revolt. In one of the most well-argued parts of his work, he shows how the development of the functions of the nasi paralleled this situation. Rabbinic influence increased in the third and forth centuries precisely because the rabbis no longer emphasized purity laws and tithing and instead concentrated on areas of the halakhah that the Galilean Jews had formerly been committed to (Sabbath, circumcision, dietary laws, etc.). Goodman rejects the usual explanation that the economic crisis of the third century demanded this change in rabbinic emphases and contends instead that Galilean village culture was showing signs of prosperity at the time. According to Goodman, "The rabbis . . . wanted to be recognized throughout Galilee as the political and religious leaders of society. When that society rejected their religious demands they modified those demands until they became what society wanted" (p. 180). Goodman is to be commended for approaching his topic in a fresh way and in pressing his methodology to fruitful conclusions. One could, however, take issue with certain aspects of his approach and some of his conclusions. Surely, Goodman is right in questioning the historical value of relevant traditions found in later collections, but it should not be automatic- ally assumed that new readings or variants found in these versions are</page><page sequence="4">252 BOOK REVIEWS always lacking in authority. Goodman suggests that his methodology allows one to check the reliability of talmudic baraitot by comparing their socio- logical assumptions to those underlying the laws found in tannaitic collec- tions. While this may be an interesting exercise (one which Goodman himself might want to undertake), it still may not shed light on the details of later versions; only careful comparisons of the parallel versions and their contexts can determine the reliability of variants and the likelihood that they are not interpolations. Moreover, one could argue that, at the very least, baraitot found in the Palestinian Talmud may be just as authentic and reliable as, say, their parallels in the Tosefta. To be sure, Goodman's approach is safer, yet it should not be assumed that it is problem-free. The argument that dependence on ma'aseh accounts is justified since there was no "motive for invention" is not entirely convincing. While out-and-out fabrication seems unlikely, ma'aseh accounts frequently appear in different versions and contexts within the tannaitic collections themselves, and so incidentals and realia which appear in them must be regarded with extreme caution. Closer attention to textual criticism at least where the major issues were concerned may have resulted in ever more convincing argumentation and conclusions. In particular, the assumption that certain tannaitic pas- sages apply to Galilee needs to be better substantiated. (For example, p. 21, where M. Ta'anit is used as evidence.) Some generalizations and conclusions which could easily be called into question include: (1) The assertion (p. 37) that women "inhabited something of a separate society of their own, excluded from any share in the public life of the community, either secular or religious, and reduced instead to concen- tration on beauty." This seems harsh and exaggerated. Goodman's conclu- sions are, he admits, contra S. Safrai's views on women in the synagogue, but the sources he refers to do not necessarily justify his conclusion. That the rabbis had certain expectations regarding personal beauty does not mean that women had no important function in society. After all, women can be beautiful and still be integrated into society. (2) On p. 39, Goodman asserts that every village had local poor and "begging continued even on the Sabbath." To prove his point about begging on the Sabbath, Goodman refers the reader to M. Shabbat 1:1, which mentions a "poor man" and a "householder." It seems likely, however, that the Mishnah does not refer to actual circumstances, but rather uses the terms "poor man" and "house- holder" in order to dramatize its discussion of the transferring of objects from domain to domain on the Sabbath. (Cf. Maimonides, who suggests</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 253 that the terms were used for the sake of brevity.) Assuming that this drama- tization still reflects the Mishnah's perspective of society and is relevant to Galilee (which is not explicitly mentioned), there still is no reason to infer that the poor man was actively "begging" on the Sabbath. (3) Goodman's assessment of the rabbis as iurisprudentes is novel, yet its implications must not be overstated. Recognition of the rabbis' authority may not have been all that the sages would have liked it to be, yet the fact that Galilean Jews did adhere to certain halakhot (Sabbath, niddah, etc.) does suggest significant acceptance of rabbinic jurisdiction. Perhaps the situation was not entirely different from that which exists today, with varying emphases existing among "orthodox" Jews but at least tacit and nevertheless widespread recognition of rabbinic authority among these same Jews. If this had not been the case, Goodman's contention that the rabbis were regarded as "almost superhuman holy men" (p. 108) would make little sense. Rabbinic authority had to at least be tacitly recognized among some Jews, in matters other than merely the calendar, for this to have been true. (Of course, this perception of the rabbis may simply reflect the rabbinic Tendenz of the literature itself.) Seen from this perspective the question of whether pre- 132 C.E. Galileans were rabbinic Jews or not (p. 232 n. 1) may also be too sim- plistic. (Goodman claims that the evidence brought by A. Oppenheimer in his work The 'Am Ha-Aretz only indicates that the Galileans venerated the Bible, not that they shared the interests of the rabbis in tithing and purity. Oppenheimer, however, tries to prove that the Galileans were not ammei ha-are;, not that they were rabbinic Jews. That is a different sort of ques- tion.) (4) Goodman offers (p. 111) three explanations for the loss of the rabbis' authority, as suggested by the relatively fewer cases brought before them, after the Bar Kokhba Revolt. These are: (a) the lack of a Galilean base for the relocated Judean schools, (b) the low status of rabbis who were immigrants and manual laborers in Galilee, and (c) the lack of sympathy among Galileans Jews for "rabbinic extremist piety." While all of these may have been contributing factors, it is just as likely that the limited amount of cases for this period simply reflects the disinterest of the people in halakhic matters after the war and their preoccupation with recovery. Surely, life in Galilee was affected by the influx of refugees from Judea, and the Galileans themselves must have been further affected by the social and spiritual upheaval. Goodman's study is a significant contribution to the increasing literature on Roman Galilee. His assessment of the Jews of Galilee complements S.</page><page sequence="6">254 BOOK REVIEWS Freyne's observations in Galilee from Alexander the Great to Hadrian, 323 B.C.E. to 135 C.E. and broadens the discussion initiated in A. Oppen- heimer's The 'Am Ha-Aretz. His work should also be read alongside of Neusner's Judaism in Society: The Evidence of the Yerushalmi, which ques- tions the extent of rabbinic authority even in the amoraic period, coming to conclusions similar to Goodman's for tannaitic times. Most importantly, State and Society is a serious attempt to address some of the methodological concerns of the present generation of historians of the period and is sure to stimulate much discussion among them.
