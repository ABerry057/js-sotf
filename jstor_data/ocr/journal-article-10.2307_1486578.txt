<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jack M. Sasson. Jonah: A New Translation with Introduction, Commentary, and Interpretations. Anchor Bible 24B. New York: Doubleday, 1990. xvi, 368 pp. In addition to representing the most up-to-date and comprehensive review of Jonah scholarship, Jack Sasson's new commentary provides a detailed philological analysis of the book together with an appreciation of the rhetorical devices embodied in the text. There are introductory essays on topics such as "Storms in Ancient Lore," "Lot Casting," "Use of Animals in Biblical Narratives," "Hebrew Poetry," and "Divine Clemency." A further feature is that Sasson introduces each verse of Jonah's psalm with helpful illustrative passages indicating how close Jonah's language is to that of other biblical poetry. In his commentary, Sasson painstakingly takes the reader through a discussion of almost every Hebrew word and phrase before arriving at the rendering that is incorporated in his translation. Along the way, he compares and contrasts the Masoretic text with the standard versions, as well as reviewing previous efforts by other commentators. Especially worthy of</page><page sequence="2">284 BOOK REVIEWS note is Sasson's careful consideration of the Masoretic accents as a basis for exegesis (see, in particular, his remarks at 3:9). In tandem with this detailed textual analysis, Sasson pays particular attention to the literary niceties of the text. Thus, the reader is informed throughout the commentary of various characteristics of Hebrew narrative style, such as repetition, attention-gathering devices, literary patterns, symmetry, chiastic structures, key words, paranomasia, hendiadys, onomatopoeia, etc. Sasson is to be commended for his efforts in offering some novel interpretations of a relatively short book which, over the years, has been the subject of considerable investigation (Sasson lists 32 pages of bibliography). One example must suffice here. At the very end of the book, there occurs in God's parable to Jonah an enigmatic descriptive phrase about the Ninevites, 'dsver l0' yAda' b n ylmtno limO '16 "who cannot discern between their right and left hands." Disagreeing with most other commentators, who contend that the phrase is about children or the mentally deficient, Sasson suggests that it may refer to the fact that Nineveh was so large in size, so teeming with life, that the inhabitants literally did not know who was living on the right and left of them, that is, they did not know who their neighbors were (p. 315). As far as the wider area of the book's genre is concerned, Sasson is properly cautious and reserved. He argues that there is no one right reading or interpretation of the book. Jonah cannot be forced into one single genre, be it myth, fable, folktale, allegory, midrash, legend, parable, satire, or parody; there are many reasonable readings and interpretations of the book as a whole. Sasson acknowledges that sections of the book can lend themselves to an allegoric interpretation. He himself suggests two: the episode on the ship, representing an allegory of the "Ship of State," which would be equated with Israel; and that of the qfqdy6n plant, standing as a metaphor applicable to the fate of human beings, and illustrating the fragility of human existence. But, of all the possible literary interpretations, Sasson favors that of seeing Jonah as a "comic dupe," a character drawn from Middle Eastern folklore who serves as a tool by which the narrator can impart his message. The centerpiece of Sasson's argument evolves around the chain of events following Jonah's famous five-word oracle in Nineveh (3:4), embedded in which is the crucial word nehpaket. The word nehpaket 'to be overthrown' is "deliberately ambiguous" (p. 234) and can be taken to mean either Nineveh's physical or spiritual overthrow. Jonah regards the phrase as predicting doom only, and when the Ninevites do repent, he is upset because (unlike Isaiah with</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 285 Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20:1-6) he was not given the opportunity to announce salvation to them. Jonah's complaint with God, then, is not about the saving of Nineveh, nor about God's mercy, but about his treatment as a prophet. Because he never grasps the double-edged meaning behind the message he communicates, Jonah perceives God's change of mind as a breach of the proper etiquette obtaining between God and prophet, so he feels misused (p. 346). However, when the qtqay6n plant appears, Jonah regards this as a sign from God; God does indeed care for him, therefore he becomes "absolutely delighted over the qt^qjyon plant" (p. 316). When God takes away the qi qdyOn plant, Jonah's mood is reversed, and he is dejected once again. Sasson's interpretation of these events is, however, not entirely satisfac- tory. While it is true that the cause of Jonah's unhappiness is not explicitly stated, there is no good reason not to believe that it was because of the salvation of Nineveh. Jonah's statement in 4:2 regarding God's mercy would have little relevance for one complaining of his treatment as a prophet, but contextually has much relevance to the reprieve of Nineveh. Secondly, it can only be a hypothesis that the qfqiy6rn functions as the means of an alleged reconciliation between God and Jonah. There is no hint of such a suggestion when the qtqjy6n first appears, nor is there such a hint in God's lesson to Jonah, where the qtfqdyn is used, rather, to illustrate God's mercy to Nineveh. Despite these reservations to Sasson's showcase argument, his suggestion about seeing Jonah in the role of a "comic dupe" does merit serious con- sideration, particularly because the same role can be identified for two other prophetic figures in the Bible: the unnamed "man of God" in 1 Kings 13, and Balaam in Numbers 22-24. In fact, the reviewer himself intends to take up this question at length in a future work. In conclusion, Sasson is to be congratulated for yet another stimulating contribution to biblical scholarship. This is a commentary from which both layman and specialist can profit, and it is a very welcome addition to the Anchor Bible series.
