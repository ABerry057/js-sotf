<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yitzhak (Eric) Zimmer. The Fiery Embers of the Scholars: the Trials and Tribula- tions of German Rabbis in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik for Ben Gurion University of the Negev Press, 1999. xii, 355 pp. (Hebrew). German rabbis of the sixteenth century, as Eric Zimmer remarks in his intro- duction, were not for the most part very distinguished; they published relatively lit- tle, and only one of them (HIIayyim ben Bezalel) achieved even moderate fame. Nev- ertheless, Zimmer has lavished his attention on these forgotten figures-David of Fulda, Abraham Stang Diilken, Isaac Ginzberg, and others-and his thirty years of patient research of manuscript sources (some of which he publishes here) have cul- minated in this book. The book is less than a complete survey of the topic, and still shows some signs of having been published initially as separate articles and studies. Zimmer presents a series of snapshots, grouped around the theme of conflict; these German rabbis, distinguished or not, did not lack for quarrels. The title of the work-from Pirkei Avot: "Beware the fiery embers of the scholars, for their bite is the bite ofj ackals"-signals the overarching theme. Zim- mer leads his readers through the messy stories of rabbinic conflicts, such as the ugly quarrel of the Ginzberg family against the rabbis of Frankfurt, including the unsuccessful battles of David of Fulda against a certain Jewish doctor and the many conflicts over the reception of the Shulhan Arukh, whose foes were led by Ijayyim ben Bezalel; disagreements over loans, over divorces, over kashrut, over prayer customs, over what sort of building may be built next to a synagogue; and conflicts over jurisdiction, over power, and especially over prestige, kavod. Writs of herem were sometimes issued; recourse by one or both parties to the non-Jewish courts was frequent; occasionally someone was thrown into prison; the rabbinic rhetoric (then as now) was heated. 151</page><page sequence="2">AJS Review Like Israel Yuval, to whose book on the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century German rabbinate this book is in some sense the sequel, Zimmer takes a prosopo- graphic approach. That is, he illustrates his subject by the biographical treatment of selected representative figures. Zimmer focuses on fewer individuals than Yuval, and he is more successful in portraying them as individuals. More than Yuval, he focuses on the variations that separated the career of a village rabbi from that of a city rabbi, or a major scholar from a lesser one. In the later Middle Ages, Yuval has argued, processes of professionalization and sacralization tended to make the rabbinate into a class of sacral functionaries, sharply distinguished from the lay leadership, whose power much exceeded theirs, and who to a great extent defined the rabbinate's duties and powers. Zimmer ac- cepts Yuval's thesis and argues that during the sixteenth century, the German rab- binate, if anything, tended to lose power even further. In such a situation, the stakes of some of these intra-rabbinic conflicts were therefore quite small. Zimmer's interest, however, is not in the stakes, but in the complex fault lines which these conflicts lay bare. He finds conflicts between rab- bis, kehilah leaders, and (later) court Jews; between clans or patronage groups (such as the Ginzbergs and their clients); between the larger communities--Frank- furt, Worms, and Prague-and the smaller ones; between "qualified" (yeshivah- trained) rabbis and unqualified rabbis; between Polish (and Polish-trained) rabbis and German ones; and between regional rabbis and local rabbis. The overall pic- ture is thus one of the complex interaction of multiple power centers, a picture that fits well into the larger picture of the infinitely complex power structure, lay and clerical, of the Holy Roman Empire. It is a truism that historians are influenced by their times and their societies. Even if they are careful and judicious scholars, as Zimmer surely is, they may be influenced by contemporary concerns in their choice of topic or focus. In a sense, this is a very Israeli book. Zimmer chooses the theme of conflict as the lens through which to view his subjects, and in consequence produces an image of a highly con- tentious, highly politicized rabbinate of sacral functionaries. We would not be wrong, I would suggest, to see in this image the reflection of a certain view of the Israeli rabbinate. Joseph Davis Gratz College Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
