Brill, 1981. xv, 419 pp.</page><page sequence="2">246 BOOK REVIEWS Judeo-Arabic thought has received somewhat uneven treatment by scholars since the meteoric rise of historical studies of all kinds in the last century. Much attention has been devoted to the classic works of this branch of Jewish studies up to and including the twelfth century. It is to the later periods of Judeo-Arabic thought that little attention has been paid up to now. D. R. Blumenthal has begun the task of placing the thought of one of the leading Yemenite thinkers of the fifteenth century in its setting by edit- ing, translating, and annotating the work under review. H.oter ben Solomon al-Dhamari, also known as Mangur ibn Suleiman al-Dhamiri, was a prolific Yemenite scholar of the fifteenth century. He was well acquainted with rabbinic literature of an aggadic and halakhic nature and also had immersed himself in the philosophical thought current in his milieu, both from the Jewish tradition and the non-Jewish environ- ment. Although it seems exaggerated to speak of a fifteenth-century Jewish renaissance in Yemen (p. ix; here and subsequently page references in parentheses refer to the book under review), on the basis of the evidence cited by Blumenthal there does seem to have been a flurry of intellectual activity in the fifteenth century of which Hoter was a principal figure. The book consists of three parts: an introduction discussing in general the intel- lectual milieu of Hoter and important themes of his enterprise, an English translation of the work with extensive notes, and a first edition of the Judeo- Arabic text of Hoter's book. First of all, what is the nature of the book? Hoter himself calls it simply "The Hundred Questions," and although most of them are concerned with philosophical and theological issues, there are some which are concerned with matters which are legal in nature (Questions 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 84). Thus the title given by Blumenthal to the book is slightly misleading and obscures to some degree the interests of Hoter. Some of the remaining questions are general in nature, remarkable in their directness, such as: "What is the law [al-sharr'ah]?" (Question 3). "What is the most noble science and what is the least [noble]?" (Question 15). "Must a person achieve perfection by means of all the sciences or is one science sufficient for his perfection?" (Question 16). "What is the human intellect and what is its function?" (Question 39). "What is the difference between 'time' and 'eter- nity'?" (Question 87). It is intriguing to see questions like these raised in fifteenth-century Yemen in the Jewish tradition. The other questions are exegetical, relating to the interpretation of the Bible or of the rabbis or of Maimonides. Hoter believes that the rabbinic worldview needs to be recon- ciled with the philosophic worldview, a position given up by Maimonides.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 247 The naivete of Hoter in comparison with the later Maimonides is further revealed by his attempt to reconcile Shi'ur Komah with philosophic thought. Of course, whether someone is naive or not is a relative judgment, since Narboni tried to do the same thing in southern France in the thirteenth cen- tury (see A. Altmann in Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies, ed. A. Altmann [Cambridge, Mass., 1967], pp. 225-288, esp. 231-232). A major theme of the introduction is Hoter's use of categories of Neo- platonic thought originating from Ism1'ili circles. This is in itself not surprising, for in general Judeo-Arabic thought in the Islamic East and West showed an active interest in non-Jewish philosophical and theological traditions, but it is good to have documentation of this attitude. However, the milieu in which Hoter worked was that of the Zaydi branch of Shi'ism, not the Isma'ili branch. Perhaps the work of Hoter may indicate that he con- tinued an older tradition of involvement with Isma'ili thought even though the outside intellectual milieu had changed in the meantime. This then would constitute a good example of Jewish cultural "jet lag." Blumenthal does not mention the very interesting evidence of Jewish influence on the external philosophic tradition contained in a bulky Yemenite non-Judeo- Arabic manuscript of the fifteenth century which contains a transcription of Maimonides' Guide into Arabic letters, including the Hebrew words, phrases, and quotations, which come out as gibberish. (See Franz Rosenthal in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 75 [1955]: 14-23, esp. 14 and 20, and also the edition of Maimonides' Guide in Arabic letters based on the Istanbul manuscript by Hiiseyin Atay, Ankara Universitesi [Ilahiyat Fakiil- tesi Yayinlari 93], 1974. In the edition Hebrew words and phrases have been translated into Arabic by the editor.) Another topic taken up at some length in the introduction is the idea that Hoter is a philosophic mystic. Here, Blumenthal, following in the foot- steps of G. Vajda, tries to set up a category of mysticism which is philoso- phic in nature. Hoter, being in the Neoplatonic tradition to a greater extent than Maimonides, I think does belong to such a category. He speaks about the union of the rational soul of man with the Active Intellect, or the Agent Intelligence, as Blumenthal prefers. However, what is lacking, at least in the published work of Hoter, is the emotive and experiential element which we find in the writings of Meister Eckhart and Ibn 'Arabi, who also should be taken as philosophic mystics. In fact, the distance between the mood of these writers and that of Hoter is very wide indeed. Perhaps one has to speak of forms of philosophic mysticism in the same way that one must speak of forms of mysticism itself. The problems involved in defining mysticism are</page><page sequence="4">248 BOOK REVIEWS notorious, and the material which Blumenthal brings to bear should be included in the dossier of this question. I should now like to turn to the translation of the work. The translation is considerably weaker than the introduction. There are examples of elemen- tary misunderstanding of Arabic idiom, as well as other infelicities. Some examples of what I have in mind follow. On p. 121 Hoter questions the meaning of Maimonides' statement that "commandments which are not binding for [future] generations have no connection to Sinai, whether they were revealed at Sinai or elsewhere." Blumenthal translates word for word, and doesn't recognize that Arabic idiom requires "whether" here. On p. 151 at the top, "similar to this is the miraculous bone" should simply be "some- thing like this is a matter of great amazement." On p. 165 he translates bi- muqdranatiha with "their being radiated into matter." The meaning here is simply "by being connected to matter." See also p. 78, where the same pas- sage is quoted in the introduction with slight differences in the translation, indicating a certain unfinished quality to the work. See also p. 226, line 9 from the bottom, p. 227, line 7 from the bottom, and p. 234, line 4 from the bottom, for the same error. Blumenthal usually translates al-mufaraq, for example on p. 149 and cf. p. 50, as "the Separated One." This term may simply mean "that which is separate from matter." He would have, I think, to make an argument that it has the specific meaning he assigns to it and refers to the Active Intellect, or the Agent Intelligence, as he prefers. On p. 166 we find the same phrase in the translation, but in the text on p. 317 we find al-mufaraqah referring to the "beings separate [from matter]," or the separate intellects, as in the next line. On p. 179 the verse from Psalms 8:6 should be translated "And you have made him a little less than ..." rather than "And He made him a little more deficient than the divine beings." Blumenthal's translation would imply that the divine beings are deficient, which is certainly not .Hoter's intention. At the bottom of p. 180, "great power will be yours" should be "Sublime ideas will come to you from this in questions to come." On p. 187, in describing the principle of contradiction, we read that "the two parts of a contradiction cannot co-exist." The better translation would be "coincide" (yaitami 'dni). Page 189, line 2: the inten- tion is not an "easy proof" but rather "an approximate proof," one that is not rigorous. On p. 189, line 6 from the bottom, "formal proof" is not "the knowledge of a thing in its true nature" but rather "that which gives the knowledge of [or defines] a thing in its true nature," and in the note read al-mu'arrif. On p. 208, curiously, Blumenthal has read m-1-k as mulk, "property," whereas it should be read malak, "angel." The translation</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 249 should be adjusted accordingly. See also p. 255, n. 5, for the same error. On p. 212, line 13, "reproaches" should be "fits." One meaning of the word has been confused with the correct meaning. Page 215, n. 5: wujad is translated as "reality" and "existence." "Existence" is preferable. Page 217, line 3 from the bottom: the meaning of muddf is not "addition" but rather "relative to" or "relatively." The same error occurs on p. 246, line 10, where we find "Nor does He [possess] the parts of additivity." This should be translated "Nor is [He subject to plurality] in the way of elements which are relative to one another." The same mistake occurs on p. 260, line 18. Page 222, line 10: al-juz' al-ardi should be "the earthly part." On p. 239 the translation "Existence gives an accident to the existent being" is rather awkward and misleading. A better translation might be "Existence is an accident attach- ing to the existing being." Cf. the translation of Pines in Guide 1:57. Here it would seem that the literality of Blumenthal has misled him. At p. 247, line 10, Blumenthal has confused '-d-d, "to count," with '-w-d-, "to return," but admittedly the passage is difficult. In general, Blumenthal has done a prodigious amount of work to identify passages and to explain the thought of Hoter in the notes to his translation. This is a pioneering effort and it is commendable, but the translation should be gone over very carefully and improved, perhaps for a second edition. In addition, a more intimate knowl- edge of philosophical literature in Arabic and its terminology, in order to get a firmer grip on its technical vocabulary, would seem to be indicated. I should now like to make some brief remarks on the edition of the Judeo-Arabic text. In general we have a new text which is readable. Unfor- tunately there is some evidence of carelessness. As soon as we open the text on p. 272 the table of contents does not have the page numbers inserted. On p. 273, line 6, nadr should be nadd, and there are a number of other typo- graphical errors. More disturbing I found the custom of Blumenthal to print the text of his main manuscript, which is clearly wrong, and give the correct reading, as preserved in the variants, in the apparatus with the note that "this is correct." See p. 286, line 6, for an example, and passim. The doubt- ful or wrong reading should have been marked in the text in some way even if he did not want to deviate from his base manuscript. There are also examples of clear omissions from the text because of homoioteleuton in which there is no attempt at restoration of the original text from the variants quoted in the apparatus or any indication of the correct text. See p. 308, line 7, p. 315, line 7, and p. 321, line 5. In the introduction the conventions of the scribe in transcribing the Arabic into Hebrew letters are not pointed out, which is somewhat confusing at first. From a methodological point of view</page><page sequence="6">250 BOOK REVIEWS one should, however, expect unusual usages to be signaled. In general, in the introduction some space should have been given to a discussion of the editorial principles which governed the editor in publishing this text. In conclusion, I think that Blumenthal must be thanked for making available to us a rich text which gives us some insight into the intellectual interests of Yemenite Jews in the fifteenth century and their relationship to the previous tradition of Judeo-Arabic thought and that of the non-Jewish world. His introduction serves as a good treatment of matters which are still just beginning to be investigated thoroughly. In the translation and the notes to the translation he has done some necessary spadework to reveal this highly intriguing aspect of Judeo-Arabic thought to a wider audience for the first time. L. V.
