<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 28:1 (2004), 43-62 MODERN MIDRASH: THE BIBLICAL CANON AND MODERN LITERATURE* by Gershon Shaked Canonization of the Bible resulted from a consensus of those to whom it was addressed and a ruling group of religious elites that established its sanctity. They declared that "Torah was given to Moses at Sinai" and valued it above and beyond its literary value. The process of canonization was not a simple one. Several books were included only after struggles among various pressure groups. For example: "At first, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes were considered non-canoni- cal because they consisted of parables, but later the men of the Great Assembly in- terpreted them." ('Avot d'Rabbi Natan, 1). Further: "The sages wished to exclude Ecclesiastes because it contained inconsistencies, but they included it because it begins and ends with teachings of Torah" (Shabbat, 30:b). The Canon of twenty-four books became the underlying foundation of Jew- ish culture; a large number of later books were viewed by their authors as mid- rashim and interpretations of the basis Canon; they in turn were separated from their original source and became independent entities, engendering their own midrashim and commentaries. It was only in the culture of the diaspora that Scripture were pushed from center stage to the background. Although the Bible kept its status as the Holy Scrip- ture and was retained in the ritual reading of the Torah and Haftarot, it was con- sidered of less importance than study of Gemara. The comments of ben Temah on the stages and contents of the structure of Jewish education illustrate the attitude of the elite toward the texts and the degree of importance assigned to them: "at five years of age, one studies Bible-at ten, Mishna-at thirteen, Mitzvot-at fifteen, Talmud" ('Avot, 5:21). Bible study was relegated to the lowest rung, while study of Gemara was the highest step on the ladder. The priority given to Talmud study remains among most Orthodox Jews to this day. The mid-nineteenth century brought a return of Bible study to its former glo- ry. It became the Book of Books for the Haskalah movement, and later served as the cultural foundation of the Zionist movement, providing the ultimate proof of the historic independence of the Jewish people and the compelling rationale for its return to the land of Israel. * Translated by Hadassah Levow Stein 43</page><page sequence="2">Gershon Shaked With the return of Jews to their land, the Zionist educational system set the study of Bible and Biblical scholarship as essential elements of education in Israel. Archeology attempted to bridge the differences among the physical findings and the texts, while the secular Zionist society emphasized the literary and artistic as- pects of the Biblical texts. Readers and artists regarded the Bible as a source to draw on for creating new literary works. The transition from an assimilating dias- pora community, struggling to maintain its national identity after losing its reli- gious one, is closely related to the transformation of the Bible into the canon of the Zionist movement and into the Book of Books for the secular community within Israeli society. It served, and continues to serve, in secular education in Israel as a cultural substitute for the study of Rabbinic law (Gemara, Poskim, and Teshuvot) which remains as the center of Orthodox education. As the Bible became more and more accepted as the classic literary foundation of the old yet new culture, it be- came more open to humanistic and artistic interpretations that are independent of religious beliefs. The choice of the Biblical Canon as the mastertext, which led to a revolu- tionary secularization by emphasizing Biblical narrative and poetry, expressed the new elite's shift from spiritual to worldly beliefs, which were, as we have noted, opposed to the traditional approach.' Historically, the shift to a Biblical culture came to a large extent from the influence of the renaissance in Italy, from German nationalism, and particularly from the influence of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803) and Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), who were succeeded in turn by Naphtali Herz Wessely (1725-1805) and his followers in writing Biblical poetry. From the beginnings of the Haskalah period of literature, the use of Biblical material gave a quasi-legitimization to the idea of introducing romantic and pro- nationalistic views into literary texts. In Haskalah and Zionist writings the Bibli- cal text had no religious connotation; it had been transformed into the necessary framework for the development of an ancient-new nation. Two basic books of the early Haskalah movement that are grounded in Bib- lical language and background are 'Ahavat Tzion [Love of Zion] (1852) and 'Ash- mat Shomron [The Guilt ofSamaria] (1856) by Avraham Mapu; other early works of this type include the Biblical poems of Wessely Shirei Tiferet [Songs of Glory] (1789) and the epic Nir David [The Lamp of David] (1834) of Shalom Hacohen, both poets who preceded Mapu, and more notably, the poems of Micha Yosef Levenson, Yael veSisera [Jael and Sisera] (185 1) and Yehuda Leb Gordon's 'Aha- vat David uMichal [The Love of David and Michal] (1856), David uBarzilai [David and Barzilai] (1851), and Zidkiyahu beBet haPedudot [Zedekiah in Prison] (1879)2 These works laid the foundation for the nostalgic romanticism of shtetel 1. This concept was formulated by H. N. Schapira, a scholar of Hebrew literature (who was a victim of the Holocaust), in his Toldot haSafrut halvrit haKhadashah, [History of Modern Hebrew Lit- erature], (1939), (Tel Aviv: , 1967), esp. pp. 55-56. 2.

The first Biblical plays-Macasey Shimshon [The Deeds of Samson] (1727) of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, GemulAtalia [Retribution of Athalia] (1770) of Franco Mendes, and Meluchat Shaul [The Reign of Saul] (1794) by Joseph Efrati of Tropolowitz-also contributed to this trend.3 The use of Biblical themes in the struggle against traditional Judaism, which had already appeared in the poems of Gordon, reached its peak in Frishman's stories in Bamidbar [In the Desert] (1923).4 Through the centuries, and to this very day, it is difficult to find a Hebrew poet-from Tchernikhovsky and Fichman to Shlonski, Alterman, Rachel, and Goldberg, to the most recent modern poets, Gilboa, Guri, Amichai, Zach, and Pagis-who does not introduce Biblical motifs or characters into his work.5 II Beginning with the Haskalah period, Hebrew literature effected a change in the explication of Biblical culture and constituted a significant midrashic force, giving it new life for its own generation. These midrashim defined the mastertext and illuminated its contextual ties. What the original midrashim did for the Bibli- cal tradition in the past is paralleled by what the new literature did for enlighten- ment period. Michah Yosef Berditchevsky (1865-1921) was the author who best summarized the cultural platform of the spiritual revolution that changed the ap- proach to the Bible. It should be noted that Berditchevsky had a rather dominant influence on the contents of the values of the new secular culture: the demand for the "new Hebrew"-who would replace the "ancient Jew," who would be bound by different traditions (or anti-traditions), and would create for himself new cere- monial rites-stems from Berditchevsky's demand for a "change in values." From his essays, which are based on biblical themes, one can perceive his view that a new approach to the Canon would change the current national charac- ter. We must oppose the generation of Ezra and Nehemiah and their followers, who returned to the land with tears and fasting, to the great generation of so-called "outlaws" who fell upon their swords ... and let us see who were the giants, and who the dwarfs. Surely the "outlaws" are worthier than the reciters of the Eighteen Blessings ... the sword is mightier than the book; those who fell on 3. P. Lahover. History of Modern Hebrew Literature.

A few outstanding examples are: Bialik's 'Agadat Shelosha veArbaah [the Legend of Three and Four], 'AlufBatzlut ve 'AlufShum [The Knight of Onions and the Knight of Garlic], and Shor Avus ve'Aruchat Yarak [The Stalled Ox and the Meal of Greens], Asher Barash's Shaul veha 'Atonot [Saul and the Asses], Chaim Hazaz in Chatan haDamim [Bride- groom of Blood],Yitzhak Shinhar in Gehazi, and later writers Moshe Shamir, Kivsat haRash [The Pau- per's Lamb] (1957), and Pinchas Sadeh in Mot 'Avimelech ve 'Aliyato haShamaimah biZro'ot 'Imoh [The Death of Abimelech and his Ascent to Heaven in the Arms of his Mother] (1969). 45</page><page sequence="4">Gershon Shaked their swords are more praiseworthy than those who escaped the city walls, hid- den in coffins ... Samson who said "let my soul die with the Philistines" is preferable to a blinded Samson who escapes.6 Berditchevsky envisioned the Israeli as a warrior: close to nature, preferring esthetics to ethics, open to every current, and unwilling to fault any stream of thought in the name of abstract Jewish principles. This change of values, which Berditchevsky proposed, was the basis for the points of view of varying streams of the new Zionist movement, and perhaps also of the so-called progressive elements in the Jewish society of the diaspora. The Israel "pioneer Zionist" society sought to be required to fulfill a collective set of commandments, by celebrating new "re- ligious-secular" rites that would distance man from the book and bring him clos- er to nature. In view of the demand for both a tie to tradition and a distancing from it, the "pioneer/Zionist" society tried to bridge possible rifts by creating a new cultural unity for those secular Olim (immigrants) who needed a common cultural base. The fifteenth of Shevat as a planting festival; Sukkot, presented as the feast of ma- jor harvesting; and Shavuot as the holiday of the early harvest, became three ex- amples of maintaining collective rites and merging ancient pre-diaspora (and possibly pre-monotheistic) contents with the new realities of the immigrant soci- ety. These ceremonies are based in the Bible, but have undergone a process of sec- ularization of their ancient religious traditions and a sacralization of new national values. The Bible was also a source for symbols of identity and jointly held myths, which were to make possible a common cultural-semiotic unity of the elements of the Israeli community. Word groupings such as "mighty as Samson" or "wise as Solomon," "David, King of Israel," "the golden calf," the "coat of many colors," the "binding of Isaac," the "concubine in Gibeah," the "selling of Joseph," "Jacob and Esau," and "Isaac and Ishmael" were not merely empty phrases but tradition- al expressions that created a commonality of connotations that resonate in the sec- ular society (as well as in the religious one!), despite the fact that these phrases can also have differing meanings in the two societies (e.g., a soccer team in a secular society can be named Samson). The Biblical Canon became a central source from which Jewish and Israeli societies could each draw its self-identification. By means of specific choices from the Canon, different parties defined their ideologies, giving each of them a canon- ical legitimacy. 6. M. Y.

[ibid., Milkhemet Olam (Eternal War) p. 14). 46</page><page sequence="5">Modem Midrash: The Biblical Canon and Modem Literature III Different ideological streams in the Zionist movement preferred to identify (either openly or covertly) with specific chapters or sections of the Bible. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the entire "rebirth movement" was delighted with Song of Songs, a book that brings man back to Eros and to nature. The choice of a partic- ular subsection of the Canon for poetry and reinterpretation transforms the sub- section to a dominant one. In this way the subsection derives its legitimacy from the very Canon of which it is a minor part. A society that bases itself on an explicating transformation of the Canon cre- ates a new tradition in this way. One can almost say that by appropriate "random" choices, the society finds a way to create an anti-canon by using the contents of the actual Canon. Reinterpretation of the Canon had already begun in the Haskalah period.7 The clear choice of the earthly flesh and blood love relationship of David and Michal (Gordon); the presentation of the relationship of Jael and Sisera as re- sembling that of Judith and Holofernes (Levenson); the obvious preference for king over prophet in Gordon's Zedekiah in prison and the higher value placed on the breakers of the law in the desert than that assigned to the priests who try to en- force their authority over them in Frischman's "In the Desert"8-these all demon- strate an attempt to read back current values into those of the past.9 The authors assume that reinterpretation of the past legitimizes the present. Hebrew literature, as we have noted, needed the canonical text, and by means of it attempted to give the present a legitimacy derived from the past and to lay out a path to a national future. Tchernikhovsky's Canaanite poems are a sort of poetical gloss on Berdit- 7. This was Berditchevsky's method, as well, in his collections of legends: MeOtzrot HaAgadah [From the Treasury ofAgadah], MiMakor Yisrael [From the Well of Israel], and Sinai U'Gerizim [Sinai and Gerizim]. 8.

One question that arises here is, "what is the meaning of culture?" and I cite here one of the definitions proposed by Stephen Greenblatt, a Jewish scholar of culture, who is considered the "father" of research in cultural studies. Stephen Greenblatt: Culture, Critical Terms for Literary Study, E Len- tricchia and T. McLaughlin, eds. Chicago: 1990, pp. 225-233. Greenblatt defines the term "culture" as a series of potential limitations and permissions. The limitations are taboos, which are punishable by anything from a look of disdain to a prison sentence, and rewards for good behavior range from looks of admiration to receipt of various honors. The values are apt to lose their force with the passing of generations, and there is a need to restore the values that guided their creators in their own time. The questions that must be asked when reading a particular work are: 1) What kinds of behavior or models of action does this work transmit to us (or force upon us)? 2) Why would readers of a specific genera- tion consider this work compelling and demanding of obedience? 3) Are there differences between the values of the current readers and the values expressed in the work? 4) On what type of social contract is the work based? 5) Whose freedom of thought would suffer or be decreased by its negative effects? 6) What are the larger cultural frameworks that the expressions of praise or censure in this work relate to? These questions refer to matters in the text that we would not normally consider in their absence. They relate as well to non-literary establishments and values: they also force us to remember that these texts have become what they are by embodying these external fundamental values. 47</page><page sequence="6">Gershon Shaked chevsky's views. They may also have been a platform for a radical right wing tra- dition in the Zionist movement. Who are you-bloods that seethe within me? Are you the blood of the generation of the desert? so! The blood of the conquerors of Canaan is my blood-it rushes and does not rest. Again that mighty song calls to me, that song of fire and blood: Scale the mountain, shatter the ground, inherit all that you see conquer the land with a mighty hand, cleave firmly to it and build up an enduring structure for the generation to come, those who will follow you.'0 Tchernikhovsky's turning to a historic, tragic, antiprophetic and fighting fig- ure such as Saul, and to a pre-monotheistic Canaanite world, is a clear expression of his search for an appropriate (subcanonical) selection that would support his outlook, within the Canon itself. He emphasized a specific value from the Canon, and pushed into the background other values found in different sections. In these texts there is a qualitative change in the rules of what is allowed and what is for- bidden in the given society." In the poem cited here, conquest and slaughter are viewed as positive values, while "Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" is moved, as it were, to the margins of the canon. This poetry is an outstanding example of a reinterpretation of Canon that seeks to produce a "shift in values" in the world-view of the intended readers of the modern midrash. IV What follows are several more complex examples of the intertextual strug- gle with the Canon or explication of it, intending to struggle by means of the in- tertext (as part of the accompanying text) with its connection to the present. Mattityahu Shoham (1893-1937) understood very clearly the revolutionary mythologic role that reinterpretation of the Biblical text could fulfill. In a discus- sion with S. Rappaport that dealt with his four plays, Yericho [ Jericho] (1924), Bal- aam (1925), Tzor ve Yerushalayim [Tyre and Jerusalem] (1933), and Elohei Barzel lo Taaseh l'cha [Thou Shalt Make Thee No Iron Gods] (1937),12 he said of the mythic role of the Biblical text: "I always turn to antiquity in order to extract sol- 10.

When I do so, I escape the split which is so characteristic of the modem mind. Modem man wears a pose of eternal skepticism, he can never believe fully in what he is doing. I always choose the men of antiquity, who were not only at one with themselves, but also did not split up the universe into discrete categories.13 In this same segment, Shoham contends that the Biblical myth is the poetic response to the skepticism of modem man and to the breakdown of values in modern society. The Biblical text is an answer not only to the national problems of the Jewish people, but probably (and possibly more importantly) to the existential problems of mankind itself. Elsewhere, Shoham says: And yet the individual and society walk a common path, a circle of for- tunes, where they interconnect and even atone for each other- through history and cult. To be sure, only the individual has a definite value, only he (and not the collective) can maintain his own small world, an endless image- only by affirming life, or denying it, and only in the individual is there hidden the po- tential for true freedom ... And there is no such freedom for a generation, a generation does not look baying the tower of life. But even the principle of individuality cannot fully express the totality of the wondrous phenomenon: Man. In it are marshaled the enduring genera- tions, leaders and followers, the birthplace, the individual, the ancient pioneer: the spirit of God is the first to struggle for the miracle, for freedom from the primeval matter of chaos, by creating words from the Tohu-Bohu.'4 In this section as well, Shoham is referring, principally, to the balance of power be- tween the individual and the group. In his view, the Biblical myth represents the meeting point between the sacred individuality of modem man and the collective archetypal forces that exist in the collective subconscious of every individual and in society as a whole. In the spirit of the mythologic explication of the Bible presented in his es- says, he views the characters from the past as archetypes composing a myth; that everything attributed to it is an attempt to renew the myth as well as a revolution- ary reformulation of it. In all of these works, Shoham presents pairs of antagonists who represent two cultures: One represents monotheism, and the second represents the opposing culture-Achan and Rahab in Jericho, Balaam and Moses in Bal- aam, Achikar and Jezebel against Elisha and Elijah in Tyre and Jerusalem, and Abraham and Gog in Thou Shalt Make Thee No Iron Gods. Shoham's work is a western/secular reinterpretation of the spirit of Israel, along with a neo-romantic nostalgia for the pre-diaspora roots of the people. He uses ancient times as background for developing an eternal battle of ideas, and he needs the Bible to mythicize and make concrete this ideological struggle, where the "mythic" Bible gives modern ideas the force of tradition. In this way, he cre- 13. S. Rappaport, "Mesichotav shel M. Shoham" [Conversations with M. Shoham] Gilyonot VII, 1938, p. 60. Compare M.

In these works, Shoham participates in what Zevi Woislavsky (1883-1957) has called "search for the myth." Woislavsky believed that "the He- brew revolution of the last two centuries is a mighty search for a new myth, one demanding adherence and respect. This revolution is the result of powerful forces which built up within the people during its long stay in the sealed ghetto."'5 Shoham created mythologic foundations for understanding the mighty ideological struggle between the spirit of the Jewish people and the forces of western culture. His work has echoes of Hegelian ideas (as interpreted by Krochmal) or possibly even Spengler (Decline of the West). One can discern ideological influences of Ahad Haam and Berditchevsky, but a discursive description of a dialectical idea is not the same as the mythic development that Shoham gave to the conflict of ideas that he described as dramatic antagonists in his mythic-historic dramas. Achan, Moses, Elisha, and Abraham represent in the myth (one which is relatively ideo- rational) a spirit of Judaism, which can be better defined by terms drawn from Krochmal and Ahad Haam than from those derived from the spirit of the Bible. Shoham uses Berditchevsky's view of Biblical culture as a mythologic culture, but does not define it as a "change of values." He is opposed to the Nietzschean ide- ology of Gog; Elijah the prophet and Abraham are closer to the spiritual Ahad Haam than they are to the Elijah who battles the priests of Baal, or the Abraham who leads his forces to engage in intertribal warfare. This is a midrash that has a sort of rational demythization of what was presented as an ancient myth. Another example of Biblical revival is in the field of theater (theater and not necessarily drama), where there was an artificial attempt to join Biblical vision to the oriental dream and to create a new model with an appropriate code. In 1928, Moshe Halevi tried to stage a Biblical-oriental (Bedouin) production that tried to embody (in an artificial way) the ideological platform for Hebrew culture and He- brew theater that had been proposed in 1922 by the poet Judah Karni (1884-1949) in his essay "Amanim baMoledet" [Artists in the National Homeland]: You may well say there is no Hebrew repertoire, but if there is none, one must turn to Hebrew history and to the Book of Books. Take your scenes from there and put them on stage. If you have regisseurs, let them try to bring the Bible to life, if you have performing artists, let them devote themselves to Biblical declamations, and to presentation of Hebrew characters from the land of the Hebrews.16 Moshe Halevi, following the ideology of Karni (and others), staged the Rus- sian play by Krashninikov, "The Tears of Rachel," at the Ohel theater, in a transla- 15.

Halevi had asked Shlonsky to rework the Russian play and "he (Shlonsky) was the one who introduced whole verses from the Bible, and trans- lated and reworked many pieces of the dialog in a way that make it difficult to dif- ferentiate between the translation and the source." Halevi turned to Dr. Yitzchak Epstein "to monitor the pronunciation of the actors, since I wanted the language to have an authentic Israeli ring to it, not only in correct pronunciation from a gram- matical point of view and in use of guttural oriental sounds, but also the special tonal qualities and musicality of the Hebrew language.""7 In order to bring the ac- tors into the special atmosphere he was trying to create on stage, he went with his cast on a visit led by Z. Vilnay to a Bedouin tribe in the Negev, to learn their cus- toms and witness an artistic performance there; "that visit was of great value to us, and it was no coincidence that in our production, the figure of the wily Laban had the attributes of a sly and patriarchal Bedouin Sheik."'8 This performance met with mixed reactions: the costumes, the lighting, and the artificial "Hebrew" speech of the actors with Russian accents all created an artificial model and a no less artifi- cial code meaning. What is worth noting is that a major effort was made to create, by various semiotic codes (speech, costume, movement) a new model, which had not existed in the past and was purely a vision. In any case, it was an attempt to "bring the Bible to life" on the stage, in terms of content and speech, lighting and costume. Moshe Halevi gave a midrashic meaning to the Bible, by using the cur- rent Bedouin existence, which he considered to be an "objective correlative" to the Biblical experience. The whole piece was an attempt to identify the current in- habitants of the land (the Bedouins) with those of the past and to call upon the Eu- ropean immigrants to adapt themselves to the current local population in order to resemble, as it were, the people of the Biblical past. V In the realm of mythopeia-the creation of myths from Biblical elements that are redefined as mythic elements-no one has surpassed H. N. Bialik, whose poem "Metei Midbar " [The Dead of the Desert] is a superb example of mythopeia, based on the Biblical source for the dead of the desert and on the several midrashim which were developed from the Biblical text.19 The source and its midrashim are the mastertext for a new and subversive midrash, which changes the meaning of the ancient texts. The original Biblical text and the midrashim for "The Dead of the Desert" are very rich. The test views the generation of the wilderness in two dis- 17. M.

This twofold approach emerges from the original traditional texts and also determines the development of the attitude toward the myth in Bialik's text. For the basic intertextual inspiration for this poem, however, one must look to the midrashic traditions, from one of which Bialik takes the motto for the poem: "Come, I will show you the Dead of the Desert" (Baba Bathra 93). Lahover em- phasizes two midrashim as significant, one from Sanhedrin, and the other from Baba Bathra, the source of Bialik's motto. Before examining these two passages in detail, let us consider several points concerning the main symbol of the poem: the Dead of the Wilderness. They are close to, or resemble the eAnakim (giants) or the Nephilim (the fallen) in Jewish tradition and that of other nations, creatures who are sent down in torment to Sheol by God or by the ruling gods as the Titans are in Greek myth, and the fallen angels of Christianity. These Giants/Gods, or Demigods, who are conquered and suppressed, are a personification of man's yearning for the perpetual life of the body, just as the heavenly angels signify his longing for the eternity of the soul. The huge bodies of the 'Anakim symbolize physical hubris (excessive pride, stubbornness), as if their aim is to struggle with the gods with their sheer physical force. In various myths, they are pictured as op- posing gods (e.g., the Titans) who rebel against the ruling group of gods and are doomed by the victors to dwell in the depths of Sheol. Other myths depict this as a rebellion of god/sons against the god/fathers, or as a suppression by father/gods of rebellious son/gods. As has already been noted, generally it is an uprising of one group of gods against another, ending in the victory of one group, which revenges itself by shutting the defeated group into the nether world. This suppression bears within it the ever-present possibility of a breakout of the defeated forces, which represent the evil nature, the primitive id, in the soul of man. This struggle appears in the verses on the Nephilim in Genesis 6:4 and recurs in the last chapters of Job in the form of Behemoth and the Leviathan (Job 40) as well as in the Apocrypha and the Evangels.20 The basic midrashic text describes the eternal curse on the dead of the desert: "The generation of the desert has no portion in the world to come, as it is written- In this wilderness shall they be consumed and there they shall die." "They shall be 20. Enoch, 1:6-8; Book of Jubilees 5:1-8; Yerachmiel, 25; Peter, 2:4; Luke, 10:17-20; Nidah, IB; Hesiod, Theogony: lines 37-87, 123-616; Ovid, Metamorphoses: Bk I lines 150-160. Motifs sim- ilar to the Nephilim= Dead of the Desert are cited by Thompson, who notes parallels with Greek, Ice- landic, Irish, Siberian, Finnish, and Indian mythologies; S.

He cites Greek and Roman mythic texts as well. These myths are carried forward into later epics such as Milton's "Paradise Lost" and "Paradise Re- gained." Romanticism returned to these myths, as in Byron's dramatic poem "Cain." 52</page><page sequence="11">Modern Midrash: The Biblical Canon and Modern Literature consumed" refers to this world; "and there they shall die" refers to the world to come. And it is also said "I swore in My wrath they should not enter into My rest." This is the opinion of R. Akiba. But R. Eliezer said "They will enter into the world to come-as it is written, Gather ye holy ones to me, those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice." Then how do we interpret the words "But I swore in My Anger-I swore in my anger, But I have repented that I swore" (Sanhedrin, 1 10B). According to this midrash, an eternal curse lies over the dead of the wilderness, and the forces rebelling against the decree have no hope of success. The death de- creed for the hidden forces in this group is final and eternal, and they will not be redeemed in the world to come, either, according to R. Akiva. There is an eternal curse on both the dead of the desert and the desert itself. In the poem "Dead of the Desert" there is a dimming of the boundaries between the characters and their setting. The setting becomes humanized and mingles with those dwelling within it. The wilderness landscape becomes a kind of mythic per- sona, and just as the characters rebelling against the curse that hangs over them, the wilderness, as a negative landscape removed from the cycle of life, rebels against the forces that have doomed it to be an eternal wasteland. The wilderness and its dead symbolize the doom of death that hangs over mankind: Because the body is finite, it cannot become infinite and eternal like those eternally embalmed bodies (which have a potential for life) or like the desert, whose life potential has been taken from it. On the other hand, one who is infinite and eternal like the em- balmed ones and the eternal wasteland cannot be forever finite and alive. Life and death are polar opposites; combining them is an oxymoron, which no logical line can break up. The revolt is an attempt to break apart the oxymoron and escape from the magic circle. Another midrash teaches that the curse that looms over the dead of the wilderness and the desert itself is a strange form of blessing. Ravah bar Bar-Hana describes it this way: The Arab said to me "Come and I will show you the dead of the desert" I went and I saw them, and they looked to be in a state of exhilaration. They slept on their backs, and the knee of one of them was raised and the Arab passed un- der it, riding his camel with spear erect and did not touch it. I cut off a corner of the blue fabric on one of them and we could not move away. The Arab said to me "If you perhaps have taken something from them, return it! for we have a tradition that whoever takes something and does not return it cannot move from the spot." So I returned it and we left (Baba Bathra 93:b-93:a). The strength and power of the dead of the desert is that they are enclosed in an eternal dimension, and that those enclosed in that dimension cannot be harmed. To be sure, they have no part of the biological process, but one who is part of the biological process cannot harm or damage them, or free them from their eternally rigid state. The dead of the desert are part of the primeval pre-creation state, where- in the differentiation of object and subject have not yet taken place. They belong to a world before birth, where entry into the cycle of life or history has not yet oc- curred. 53</page><page sequence="12">Gershon Shaked This myth has a subversive and extra-historic meaning that changes the myth of Exile and Redemption, the foundation of both Judaism and Zionism.21 What emerges from the development of the symbolic drama is that the poem (or its gen- eral message) questions whether existence, out of time or history, may not be preferable to entering into time as an active force in history. Or, to put it another way: Which is preferable, the state of living death or shattering the oxymoron by rebelling against the order of the universe? "If God has withdrawn His hand from us / And His Ark from its place does not depart-/ then let us go up without it!" These questions are not resolved in the course of the plot, or, if they are resolved, it is a strange resolution-the end of the rebellion bears witness to its beginnings. In 1904, in his poem "Davar" Bialik wrote: "And with shouts of 'rebirth' on our lips, and cries of victory, we will totter to the grave." This line is an open and sharp expression of an experience described two years earlier in "Metei Midbar "-where rebellion ends not in redemption and rebirth but in the surren- der of the rebels. The stillness of the desert after the rebellion is more terrible that that which reigned before. What remains are the Arabs who tell the story of the people of the script. What should we consider to be the message of this poem? Is it a secular re- volt against God's historic curse? Is it an elegy for a failed rebellion? An apoca- lyptic vision of the dangers faced by those trying to return into history after being shunned and concealed for generations? An apotheosis of heroic revolutionaries preparing for their final battle without any thought to its tragic results? The myth- ic-symbolic action of this poem, based on a deep intertextual tie to the Bible and the tradition, presents difficult questions to its intended audience. Anyone who considers those questions outdated, almost a century after they were posed, is sure- ly mistaken. History has not yet given us clear and definitive answers. Bialik's poem is a subversive interpretation of both the religious Jewish myth and the secular Zionist one. The canonical materials serve as a basis for a revolu- tionary commentary on the canonical tradition and the historiosophy expressed within it. One can, of course, point to subversive elements somewhat similar to these, within the body of the Canon itself, (as Berditchevsky did in his Collected Legends22), but Bialik brought background materials to the foreground and changed the character of the myth by a transition from a linear concept of time, 21. One can also interpret Bialik's myth as developed in Metei Midbar in another way, by us- ing the Biblical and midrashic materials thus: the symbol of Metei Midbar represents a vital earthy at- tempt by man to conquer the curse of death. The paradox is that this conquest can be achieved in only two ways, neither of which is real. One is by acquiescing to death and making peace with time. The other is overcoming death by a vital eruption into life. But this brings the attackers into the ordered world of the small cycle (which is part of the encompassing structure of the large cycle), which says that all life is finite, and that life is a small spark in the eternal darkness. However, there exists in the soul of man as an entity (and not as a single-lived creature) a paradoxical (in Nietzschean terminolo- gy, Dionysian) demand for eternal life. The wish to live is a basic desire of man's soul: even if he is part of the divine plan, he is part of the dialectic of human existence, which seeks life despite its awareness of death. This dialectic is heroic because it is illuminated by the ironic light of time and because it is innately hopeless. Its victory is failure, and its failure is victory.

Bialik's text uncovered in the Canon itself (or by means of the Canon) a subversive mythic option that reverses the positive interpretation of the myth of exile and redemption to one which fits the needs of the dominant Jewish and Zionist ideologies. VI One can judge the developing changes in attitudes of Hebrew poetry toward the Bible by considering the alternate interpretations in the approach to one of the most significant Biblical characters, one whom different poets dealt with from a variety of points of view, and was used by them to express differing worldviews. An example of this is the character of King Saul, the subject of literary and midrashic interpretations from the end of the eighteenth century (in Joseph Haephrati of Tropolowitz's 1794 play, Meluchat Sha'ul) to the end of the twenti- eth century.23 The author who presented the image of Saul and all the latent possibilities of his character was none other than the great spiritual revolutionary of Jewish cul- ture of the early twentieth century, M. Y. Berditchevsky. Comparing Saul to David, he wrote: Saul was head and shoulders above the whole nation, a man of distinction, a great man of heroic spirit. When he goes on that night to consult the Seer of En-Dor, a pang of sorrow creeps into every heart, and when he falls on his sword lest the Philistines desecrate his body, our every inner voice is stilled and astonished by his heroic soul.24 Tchernikhovsky, who shared with Berditchevsky the ideals of changing val- ues and the yearning for an image of the "new Hebrew," devoted many poems to his heroic image of Saul, whom he considered a Biblical archetype worthy of praise and emulation.25 His ballad "'Al Harei Gilboa" [On the Mountains of Gilboa], 23. Born in 1770 in the city whose name he bears, Tropolovitz later moved to Ratibor, where he taught Yoseph ben Yekutiel Zalman Ratibor, the son of a wealthy resident of the city. He spent the years 1791-1794 in Prague, and died in 1804, probably in Ratisbor. For a discussion of the play and its characterization of Saul see: meLuchat Shaul (edited and with preface by G. Shaked), Sifriat Dorot, Bialik Institute, Jerusalem 1968. On the character of Saul in other literatures, see: L.

The poem was written in Fichten- grund, but is to be read as written in the land of Israel and addressed to those in the diaspora who seemed to sit by idly. In this poem, Tchernikhovsky praises the heroism of Saul as a warrior, one who prefers death to surrender or captivity; his death is a sort of archetypal precedent for the men of Masada who fell on their swords. This heroic image was meant to serve as an archetypal example for the fighters of Jerusalem.26 There are two dramatic voices in the ballad "'Al Harei Gilboa": the king and his arms-bearer, the latter of whom is the main speaker. The poetic speaker is not present in the ballad, allowing the two voices to speak for themselves. The absence of the lyric voice of the poet heightens the dramatic effect and adds weight to the exchange as a historic dialog. The poem enlarges on a historic situation that ap- pears in the Biblical source and depicts Saul as a hero struggling with his fate in his final moments. In the refrain that ends each of the six stanzas (written in hero- ic dactylic meter) the speaker (the arms-bearer) demands that the proper con- clusions be drawn from the terrible state in which Saul finds himself ("the uncircumcised outnumber us today"). The conclusion is addressed not only to those belonging to the adherents of the hero and the speaker, but to the entire eth- nic group of the future (the present tense in which the poem is written): "Shall the lamb of Israel by slaughtered like sheep! ... Go up and fill the places of the fall- en and the stumbling!" In the name of the hero who has fallen as a sacrifice on the altar of the na- tion, the speaker demands of the masses that they take the places of the fallen, and the author creates a metahistoric mythological figure: one who can overcome physical weariness at a time of crisis ("No time for resting-no rest, oh trum- peter!"), one who wrestles with the forces of fate and nature ("Even the sun no longer warms me"). He rises above the desolation of the bereaved, as a father sac- rificing his sons in war ("Nobles give their threefold gift"), and continues the struggle, even though it is a war of the few against the many ("For we are out- numbered this day by the uncircumcised"). Tchernikhovsky has created a heroic tragic figure, who, by his death, commands us to live. The death of Saul is meant to lead to rebirth, if there are, indeed, those who will go up and replace the fallen and the wounded. The word "'alu"--"go up," in this context-is addressed to both the present and past (generations) and has a broad connotation in 1929. This is not a call to go up to the mountains of Gilboa and do battle there, it is, rather, a cry to those who "sit by the wayside, the tribes that hold themselves aloof, the slander- ers, the waverers, the lazy" in the lands of the diaspora, to "go up" to the land of Israel and to fill the places of the "fallen and wounded" lest the "lamb of Israel" be "slaughtered like sheep." the Ruins of Bet Shean], 'Anshei Khail Khever [The Stalwarts], "Al Harei Gilboa " [On the Mountains of Gilboa], "haMelech" [The King], "vaYehi beYeshurun Melech" [And There Was a King of Jeshu- run], and the poem sequence "Shir ha'Ahava asher leShaul" [Saul's Song of Love]. 26.

The Gilboa has be- come a battlefield, which unlike Masada, still has a future, and if the people sit- ting idly by regain their courage, all is not lost: There is hope that the Jews fighting for their lives at the end of the 1920s have a chance of survival. VII About fifteen years after Tchernikhovsky's ballad "Al Harei Gilboa" was published, Alterman's ballad "Hinei Tamu Yom Krav veArvo " [The Day of Battle and its Evening have Ended] appeared for the first time.27 It was published in the annual Davar immediately after World War II, when the first news of the destruc- tion of European Jewry became known, and was later included in his collection Jr haYonah [The City of the Dove] which appeared in 1957. This collection itself can be viewed as a summary and essence of the two traumatic and formative experi- ences of the Jewish people in the twentieth century: the Holocaust and the War of Independence. Dov Sadan has said this: "The face and course of history are reflected, not in generalizing metaphor, but in the detailed picture, not in the broad blurring ex- panse of sand, but in the individual and different grain of sand, the stance is among the people, in the midst of its war, in the daily-ness" of its incongruities, and par- ticularly in its calling of things by their true names. All this with an awareness that history, as it existed, cannot be erased, and that the impressions of this history as it was lived, live on within us, because we are its summary."28 Sadan emphasized the nationalist character of this collection, which attempts to cope with the expe- rience of the blossoming of the Jewish state from a traumatic tragedy, and a victo- ry that was also accompanied by loss and bereavement.29 The poem that precedes the ballad is "'Amrah Kherev Hanetsurim" [The Sword of the Besieged Spoke] and the one which follows it is "Shirim cal Eretz ha- Negev" [Songs of the Negev]. These two poems indicate the nationalist context of siege and rebuilding against which one must view the ballad "Hinei Tamu Yom Krav ve"Arvo." It is not based directly on the Biblical figure. Saul is mentioned only in- directly, and what concerns the poetic speaker is the place and standing of the Bib- lical hero in the consciousness of the nation "fighting for its freedom." The ballad does not describe the war itself (as does "'Al Harei Gilboa") but, rather, the mood of the people after the war. The characters of the drama are the speaker, a messen- ger who comes from the battle with his swift horse, and Saul's mother, who ap- pears as a symbol to which everyone can relate. The poem has many balladic characteristics: the quick anapestic trimeter, the recurring refrain, the musical 27. N. Alterman, Hinei tamu Yom Krav veArvo, originally appeared in the annual Davar for 1944, published in 1945, pp.12-13, and republished in Ir HaYonah, Tel Aviv, 1957, pp. 184-185. The quotations are from the later text. 28. Dov Sadan, "B'Mivoah Ir Ha Yonah, Ben Din v'kheshbon " [Essay on Authors and Books], TelAviv, 1963, p. 129. 29. Sadan rightly points out that the volume met with criticism from poets and younger critics who disliked its form and contents, and considered the volume to be an inflated version of "Tor ha- Shevii." Sadan defends Alterman's right to identify himself, clearly and with no shortcuts, with the Zion- ist narrative there, pp. 127-128. 57</page><page sequence="16">Gershon Shaked rhyming, and particularly, the dramatic structure that begins with the messenger on his swift horse and ends in the dialog between the runner and the mother and the speaker's line, "And David heard". Tchernikhovsky's ballad tried to omit the "poet's voice" (the speaker), and emphasized the other voices, whereas Alterman presents a poet (speaker)-observer of the situations-one who reacts to them. It is only in the last stanza that there is a dialogue between the character of the runner, who reports the death of the king, and the mother who hears the tidings of death. In the character of the mother, the poet symbolizes the reaction of the nation, rep- resented by her, to the heroic death of its king. The author, using the new character that is not present in the mastertext, de- velops the message that society, in its given historic context and even beyond that, can learn from the tragic death. The mother becomes the central figure of the bal- lad; her reaction to the historic death of her son becomes a heroic symbol for moth- ers for all periods and generations: This mother has the inner strength to move beyond bereavement. The source of her strength is the long horizon. This long hori- zon is what assures the survival of the coming generations, even though the fallen one was the hero of his time and for his time. What is established by the speaker is that clinging to the long view is what creates heroes: one who falls in the de- fense of his homeland cannot be defeated. "But sevenfold shall the nation arise/ if defeated on its native soil/" and yes: "his heir will arise, in due time/ for it was into his own land that he thrust the word and died upon it." The ballad centers on the value of the expanse, the place. The assumption (a novel one, which originates in Zionist ideology) is that a nation that fights for its life in its homeland will never be defeated. The experience of the native land is, in the eyes of the speaker (and the author) more significant than the experience of the historic time. The power of the nation is not in historic memory, nor is it in a hero who becomes a national symbol, but, rather, it is in the hero's devotion to the ex- panse of his native land. The principal figure in the ballad is the mother-the moth- er who is identified with the land. She is a transformation of Demeter, the greatest mother, the motherland that gives birth to the leaders who will defend her. Lead- ership and heroism are not dependent on mortal men, but on the expanse that cre- ates them. Time and again, the great mother creates from within herself leaders who will take the place of those fallen in her defense: "Thus she spoke, and her voice trembles/ and thus it was, and David paid heed." It follows, therefore, from his text that it is not the time, but the expanse of space that is the source of the na- tion's strength. The historic symbol "Saul" is still needed but depends on the spe- cial feeling for the place. The force for national survival is not dependent on identification with a Biblical character, raised by the Seer, and given an actual midrashic interpretation, but, rather, on an amorphous connection of a mytholog- ic figure to the homeland. We have here a basic difference in interpretation of the motif from that of Tchemikhovsky: What impelled society then, and does so even now, according to Alterman, is its eternal bond to the soil of the homeland. In the transitional period from the Holocaust to the rebirth, Alterman ex- presses the Zionist worldview that ties the hope for the survival of the nation to the return to its land. 58</page><page sequence="17">Modern Midrash: The Biblical Canon and Modem Literature VIII In both of these ballads, the tragic Biblical hero serves as a symbol for a trou- bled and besieged nation that suffers defeat at the hands of stronger enemies. In both, the poets try to react to and overcome the historic defeat: The key in Tch- ernikhovsky's poem is "cAlu," "Go up!" In Alterman's ballad it is "'Adamah," "the Land." According to Tchernikhovsky, the way out of this terrible state is for the tribes who sit idly by to "go up" and join in the struggle; according to Alterman, the yearning of the people for its 'adamah will provide the assured solution. The 'adamah will provide the salvation and the savior (David). The dichotomy in these two ballads is between the enemies from outside the land and the hero and his peo- ple within. The victory of the enemy is temporary, and in the end, the defeated peo- ple will overcome and triumph. The balladic development moves from a tragic state to a promise of redemption. Both of these works are remarkable Zionist interpre- tations of the Biblical mastertext: use of Biblical myth to develop a Zionist myth; Aliyah and putting down roots in the land. The Saul motif has a different meaning and fills a different role in a poem on this subject published by Yehudah Amichai one year after Alterman's poem was published in be'lr ha Yonah (1957). The poem "haMelech Shaul va'Ani " [King Saul and I] appeared in Amichai's volume beMerkhak Shtei Tikvot [At a Distance of Two Hopes], published in 1958.30 The ballad Hinei Tamu Yom Krav ve'Arvo struggles with the two central experiences of the Jewish people in the 1940s, the Holocaust, which occurred before its publication (1944), and the experience of the War of In- dependence, which followed it. Amichai's poem was written after the events. His poem describes the feelings of the fighters who returned saddened and dispirited from World War II and from the War of Independence. Amichai says of this gen- eration: "Alas for my sad and weary generation, which at least two wars for each man. Those of my age in other places are already army generals, captains of in- dustry and heads of state."31 The poem "HaMelech Shaul va'Ani " reflects the mood that appears in this quote from Amichai's novel "Lo me Achshav velo miKan " [Not from this Time and Not from this Place]. It is not a ballad; it has no formal dramatic structure and it is not divided into individual voices. It has no specific meter, and the rhythm of speech determines the flow of the text. This is a lyric reflective poem-the poet's voice as he views himself. He tries to define his own identity by a contrapuntal as- sociation with the Biblical symbol, who is here also portrayed as a heroic figure. The language of this poem is remote from any ancient historical period, and the writer uses words and constructions taken from the everyday language of the pre- sent. From a structural point of view, the poem is essentially contrapuntal and con- sists of a long line of antitheses that measure the I-Speaker against the character of King Saul-the other. The identity of the self is developed through comparison with the "other," who is more symbolic/mythologic than historic. The image of 30.

The opposing image becomes the standard by which the speaker measures himself. The opposing image is possibly the figure of an old- er brother: "He was my big brother/ I inherited his old clothes/" or possibly he is the all-powerful father, in whose shadow the son finds shelter. The son/brother di- minishes in the face of the older brother/father, and in the course of the poem the "speaker" seems almost to enjoy his lowered status and idleness. The "I" reduces him to a zero, as it were, when he compares himself to the standards by which the other is judged. In this poem as well, there is a sort of secular heroism that is a source of longings, but there is an unbridgeable gap between the speaker who views the hero with yearning eyes and the archetypal Biblical hero who serves as the ideal of bravery for his generation. The differences between the "I" (speaker) and the "other" are emphasized, as we have noted, by a long line of antitheses that are built into the poem: "they gave him a finger, but he took the whole hand/ they gave me the whole hand, I didn't even take the little finger." Saul is an activist figure who is drawn to action by an external force, as opposed to the "I," who is a passive figure moved by an external force to submission and retreat to the point where he cannot extend his hand to take up what fate bestows upon him. The two differ also in their spiritual lives. Whereas the "I" has trained himself "to pick up primary feelings," Saul has trained by "tearing apart oxen." The poet sets out two opposing processes of mat- uration and development. Saul's development expresses itself by tearing up oxen to call the people to battle against the enemy, an outstanding action of an extrovert, testing his powers of decision and action as a national leader. In contrast, the de- velopment of the "I" is that of a man who is so much of an introvert that he can barely carry the burden of his own complicated emotions and has no connection to the world of action. The joining of the images of weight-lifting and bearing emo- tions emphasizes the sense of burden that the "I" has in dealing with his sensitiv- ity. His inner struggle paralyzes his ability to act, and he becomes an anomic and powerless figure: "the pace of my pulse is like dripping water from the tap" and this, too, is in contrast to the mighty power of the older brother. The dichotomy between the brothers is expressed in the following lines, which reveal the relationships between the brothers/generations in simple words and a very compressed style: "He was my big brother/ I got his old clothes." The relationship between the exemplary older brother and the younger brother who is his poor imitation is pictured for us in the image of the hand-me-down used clothes. This expresses the experience of an inheritance that has nothing of its own and is nourished only by the leavings of the older brother. The difference between the two also lies in the awareness of direction and orientation of the older brother, while the younger has lost his way: Saul is "as true to his mission as a compass or an alarm clock." In contrast, the younger brother's way of life is a total opposite. One went out to search for asses and found a king- dom, the other went and found only asses. The younger brother can't even control his finds, "they kick him." 60</page><page sequence="19">Modem Midrash: The Biblical Canon and Modem Literature These antitheses continue throughout the poem, summarized with the words "He is a dead king/ I am a tired man!" The final antithesis sets the image of a king against that of a man. The poet presents two levels of what Frye has called pre- sentation of character developed in "high mimetic mode" and presentation of char- acter in "low mimetic, ironic mode." Two worlds appear one after the other in the course of time (the elder ... the younger) but they also coexist next to one another. The "I" recognizes what one may call the decline of the generations or a transition from a yearning for a hero- ic ideal to a stage of resignation, or accepting the inevitable, that heroic identifi- cation is beyond the reach of a man of the new generation that he must settle for his diminished identity, such as it is. The dead lion is of higher value than the liv- ing dog, but the living dog remains on the scene, and having no choice, accepts that he is what he is. The weary generation returning from battle is no longer fit for struggles and heroic aspirations. Saul is no longer an object of emulation and yearning, the generation no longer wishes to die, as he did, in a heroic death, a death of one against the many, or a meaningful death on the soil of the motherland which would bring forth an heir for every sacrifice. This generation is tired of war and heroics and as Amichai puts it, "wants to die in its own bed." In both these bal- lads, the poets found in the mastertext a heroic/tragic figure who serves as an ide- al for emulation and identity, a figure that by its very existence in collective memory transmits a hope or a possibility for a rebirth of national heroism; how- ever, Amichai describes a war-weary generation, which still admires the genera- tion of older brothers who fought but willingly gives up the ideal that the wearied generation can no longer accept nor want to shelter in its shade and identify with its values. The struggle in this lyric-reflective poem is between passivity and ac- tivism, introversion and extroversion, resignation and heroism, exhaustion and freshness. The heroic figure of the mastertext has changed its function and signif- icance, and Amichai's midrash on it is subversive and revolutionary. Amichai shat- ters the ideal of the earlier generation and expresses the sense that the new generation is not capable of measuring up to the demands engendered in the myths of the older brother's generation. IX Modern Hebrew literature, by giving a secular (and sometimes subversive) interpretation of the Bible, becomes a modern midrash that tries to infuse the blood of the past into the veins of the present and the blood of the present into the blood- stream of the past.32 This midrash reflects a culture's attempt to build itself by rein- terpreting its Canonical literature. This grounding of modern literature in the myths of the ancient Canonical literature in order to give legitimacy to the revolutionary present results from the perception that the roots of the revolution are, in some way or other, embedded in that mythologic literature, and that modern literature must be built on the connection to the past, interpreting and adapting the past to the ideo- mythologic needs of the present. 32. If one may use one of Nietzsche's well-known phrases. 61</page><page sequence="20">Gershon Shaked The late-noted educator Zevi Adar defined this positive "struggle" with the Bible in this way: Two thousand five hundred years, or more, have passed since Job was an- swered by God. Ever since then each generation reads the Bible with its own eyes. We who are alive today are commanded to ponder it and to translate it into our own language, in order to comprehend it as it stands, and by doing so, we will understand ourselves. We are enjoined to go toward to it and bring it to ourselves. Perhaps in this way we will be drawn to the spirit of that Book (which has relevance for every generation) which can teach us what the ques- tions are, and how to search for the answers. For the Bible, in the words of Matthew Arnold, is not dogma, but literature.33 We have presented here a very small number of examples of modern mid- rashim on the Bible. Countless poets and dramatists throughout Hebrew literature have made use of Biblical materials that have been reinterpreted; these materials have also been used in fiction. The overwhelming need to connect between past and present, between the historic and mythological world of the Bible and the everyday world of the reborn nation, could not be fulfilled, and continues into the present day. Some of the interpretations are within the spirit of the Bible, others change the meaning of the mastertext in a very revolutionary spirit, but even those whose approach is to make the text conform to the spirit of the times, or those who use it to fight the spirit of the times, are still bound by conscious and unconscious ties to the mastertext, which has become part of the collective subconscious of the society which adopted it.
