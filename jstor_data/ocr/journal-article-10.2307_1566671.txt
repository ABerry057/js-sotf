Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998. xix, 269 pp. South Philadelphia is a charming but somewhat shabby district, an area with its own unique style of architecture. A hundred-year-old Jewish community survives in what is now a mixed neighborhood. The Jewish residents are typically elderly first- and second-generation Americans. Rakhmiel Peltz has written a study of conversations in Yiddish that took place at a discussion group he organized called A Gleyzele tey ("a glass of tea"), where Yiddish was spoken despite the fact that "most Yiddish speakers in South Philadelphia, at least in public, ordinarily spoke English" (p. 11). How does one describe Yiddish conversation in a community that does not ordinarily converse in Yiddish? The problem was solved with the establishment of A Gleyzele tey. "My intention was to help create a comfortable atmosphere in which</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 145 unencumbered conversation would be the central activity. My main purpose was to observe" (p. 44). The conversations, excerpted throughout the text and printed in the appendix, turned out to be extremely informative. Different readers will find different data in these documents, depending on their interests. I was struck by the fact that English words such as "but" and "never" had completely replaced older forms such as Standard Yiddish ober and keyn mol nit. Borrowing is normal in language, and immigrant languages are particularly likely to absorb words from the surrounding community; it was not surprising to find "papers," "chance," and "discharge" in Yiddish conversation. Nevertheless, the replacement of function words-adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, etc.-is unusual. I suspect that the disappearance of grammatical words, words relating one part of a sentence to another, from South Philadelphia Yiddish reflects the fact that Yiddish was no longer being used as an everyday language but was restricted to a few domains, generally connected with storytelling and autobiography. In Peltz's words, "Very few children of immigrants embraced Yiddish as a means of daily communication. Rather, they used Yiddish in a ritualized manner periodically to express ethnic identity and culture in a group setting" (p. 203). Yiddish in this community has ceased to function as an all-purpose language. English comes to the lips more spontaneously. Let us consider the following example of code switching: "When Itke entered, I greeted her in Yiddish. She, however, approached Yankl B. in English, and he responded in English, despite the fact that he had just been talking to me in Yiddish" (p. 57). Yiddish, Peltz tells us, is a source language for proverbs and folk wisdom. On the other hand, it is not being used in new situations. When a Russian immigrant, Marye, appeared, Yiddish was of no help. "At the Center, although many members could speak Yiddish, only a few communicated with her.... They did not view Marye as someone who shared their own European heritage who had been miraculously placed in their everyday midst in South Philadelphia, but as someone who should learn to be American. And Marye could not understand why there was so much talk about Yiddish at the Center but so few people for her to speak to there" (p. 105). Is there a distinction between a first language and a native language? Many of Peltz's informants, including some of those born in America, had learned Yiddish</page><page sequence="3">146 BOOK REVIEWS before English. Yet English had become more spontaneous for them. There was code switching and two-way borrowing, which was to be expected. But what are we to make of "but" and "never"? Has the syntactic structure of South Philadelphia Yiddish begun to weaken? Even the most fluent Yiddish speakers among the informants gave the impression of being more eloquent in English. Has English, in effect, become everyone's native language-the language that comes most spontaneously and most effectively to the lips? Many South Philadelphia Jews are descended from immigrants from what is now Ukraine. Their Yiddish may include regional pronunciations, such as tote and mome instead of tate and mame, meaning "daddy" and "mommy," or gevin ("been") rather than geven or geveyn. The preservation of these relatively rare forms reflects a natural, unstudied, authentic Yiddish. Nevertheless, it is probably also evidence that Yiddish was primarily spoken among relatives. There is a certain amount of dialect leveling in the community, but less than I would have expected. Peltz is optimistic about the future ofA Gleyzele tey: "It became clear that the element of joy associated with speaking Yiddish and with congregating for this purpose ensured the group's existence and development" (p. 69). I wonder whether joy is enough. The South Philadelphia Yiddish speakers described here loved Yiddish but had already failed to pass it on to the next generation. I found a different situation in my own study of a Hasidic community, where the children could speak Yiddish on any subject and in any situation.' Yiddish is one of the everyday languages of a rapidly growing community. In an article in the Forward, Dovid Katz suggests that secular Yiddishists and Hasidim are natural allies when it comes to Yiddish.2 The material in Peltz's book suggests that linguistically, as well as ideologically, this alliance may not be so obvious.
