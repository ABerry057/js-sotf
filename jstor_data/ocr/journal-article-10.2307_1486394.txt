<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN: SOME METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES by CHAVA WEISSLER What does it mean to study women's religion? How are we to define our subject matter? How are we to understand the relationship of the history of women's religious life and practice to the history of particular religious traditions? I shall explore these questions within the context of a very specific topic: the religious life of Ashkenazic (Central and Eastern European) Jewish women in the late seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries, as seen through the popular religious literature of the period. This literature, which was addressed primarily to women, was in The research on which this article is based was supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (FA-24469-84). I wish to express my gratitude to the Founda- tion. My thanks go as well to Professors John Gager, Martha Himmelfarb, and Ivan Marcus, and to Dr. David Satran, for their helpful comments on various drafts of the article. A note on the romanization: I have romanized the titles of works which are entirely or almost entirely in Yiddish according to their Yiddish pronunciation, even if the titles consist entirely of Hebrew words. 73</page><page sequence="2">74 CHAVA WEISSLER Yiddish, the vernacular of Ashkenazic Jews, rather than in Hebrew, the sacred language, understood almost exclusively by men. My thinking about the different approaches one could take to this material, and the different uses to which it could be put, was stimulated by a lecture given by Joan Scott on the study of women's history.' Using a framework of analysis suggested in part by Scott's work, I will distinguish between three general approaches to the study of women's religion: (1) those that add an account of women's religious lives to an already existing history of Judaism; (2) those that consider women's Judaism within the framework of other groups usual- ly omitted from the history of Judaism; and (3) those that seek to transform our understanding of Judaism through the incorporation of the perspective gained from the study of women's religion. Filling in the Blanks To start with the first approach: One way to begin our study might be to ask, What has been left out of the history of Ashkenazic Jewish religious life and expression in the early modern period? The history of Jewish religious life as it has been written is chiefly the history of the educated elite. Indeed, it must be, since the most important sources for this history are the written works produced by learned men. Because so few women received more than the rudiments of Jewish education throughout the ages, the spiritual life of women, as a group, has been perhaps the most neglected area of the history of Jewish spirituality. Few women learned Hebrew, the language of scholar- ly communication, and even fewer left any literary legacy, even in the vernacular. Further, not only did women produce no works of religious philosophy, legal rulings, or mystical speculation, they were excluded from the arenas of public religious life: the talmudic academy, the rabbinical court, the kabbalistic conventicle, and the hasidic gathering. Even in the synagogue, women did not count as one of the minimum number of ten adults required as a minyan, could not lead the service, and sat behind a partition, or in a balcony or a completely separate room. 1. Scott's lecture was published as "Women in History II: The Modern Period," Past and Present 101 (1983): 141-157. Other important articles on the doing of women's history include: Joan Kelly-Gadol, "The Social Relations of the Sexes: Methodological Implications of Women's History," Signs 1 (1975-76) : 809-824; Gerda Lerner, "Placing Women in History," in her The Majority Finds Its Past (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 145-159, and "The Challenge of Women's History," ibid., pp. 169-180.</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 75 Can it be that, because of this exclusion, women had no religious life to speak of? Or that it was entirely derivative, a pale shadow of what the men were doing? Or did women have spiritual lives of their own, nourished in some way by Jewish tradition as mediated by men, but also developed independently? If they did, is it possible to retrieve this religious life, and what sources exist which will help us to study it? Fortunately, there does exist a rich array of sources for writing the religious history of Ashkenazic Jewish women. Beginning in the sixteenth century, there began to appear in print a voluminous homiletical, ethical, and devotional literature in Yiddish, the vernacular of Ashkenazic Jews. Information from the title pages and introductions of these works, and contemporary accounts, indi- cate that women were the chief audience for these collections of pious tales, guides to the upright life, paraphrases of the Bible, and supplicatory prayers. These last, the prayers called tkhines ("supplications"), have been my parti- cular interest. Because some of them seem to have been written by women as well as for women,2 I regard them as an especially important source for the study of Ashkenazic women's religion. There are, of course, difficulties involved in using any of these sources. First and foremost is the fact that most of them were written by men. They can be defined as a women's literature in terms of their audience-their readership. Indeed, there is evidence that these Yiddish works were very popular: women read and reread them. Given that this is the case, one can argue that they must have corresponded in some degree to women's experi- ence; otherwise, women would not have bought and read them. Even with the tkhines, some of which were written by women, there are difficulties. First, many collections of tkhines were published anonymously. Were they written/compiled by men or by women? Second, some of those attributed to women can be documented to have been written, pseudonymously, by men.3 2. Cynthia Ozick, in her article "Notes toward Finding the Right Question" (in On Being a Jewish Feminist, ed. Susannah Heschel [New York: Schocken, 1983], pp. 120-151), does her readers a disservice by creating the impression that virtually all tkhines were forged by indigent male yeshiva students (pp. 132-133). This practice did not begin before the mid-nineteenth century, and thus there is no a priori reason to doubt attributions of tkhines (or other Yiddish literature) to female authors whose works were published before that period. This includes authors such as Rebecca Tiktiner, mentioned by Ozick, who can be documented to have existed. It is unfortunate that the misinformation Ozick conveys has gained such wide currency.

Do works written by women and men differ in definable ways? There is another sort of difficulty, more specific to particular genres. An example is the musar literature. Although all the Yiddish musar literature was probably read by women, one work in particular, the Brantshpigl, writ- ten by Moses Henoch Yerushalmi Altshuler, first published in 1596, was addressed to women in particular.4 It includes chapters such as "This chapter explains how the modest woman should conduct herself in the home"; "This chapter explains who is a good wife and who is a bad wife"; and even "This chapter explains how, with much talking, women can talk their way into Eternal Life."5 Yet we may ask, how does one extrapolate from the prescriptive to the real? To rephrase the question, what is the rela- tionship between the recommendations of Moses Henoch Altshuler and what women actually did and felt?6 Analogous questions may be asked about the collections of pious tales, such as the Mayse bukh (first published 1602), in which the moral is sometimes longer than the story.'

Another fascinating genre which raises such questions is the guide to the observance of women's commandments, known in several related versions. The earliest extant manuscript dates from 1504, and the first published editions of each version date from 1535, 1552, and 1577. These works deal with the three women's commandments: lighting Sabbath candles (10 chapters in the Basle, 1602, ed.); separating dough for hallah (15 chapters); and, especially, the observance of menstrual avoidances and purification (105 chapters). For a definitive study of these works, see Agnes Romer Segal, "Sifrey migvot ha-nashim be-yidish ba-me'ah ha-16" (Masters' thesis, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1979). 7.

To use the tkhines as an example: A survey of the many occasions on which women recited tkhines enables us to map out the impor- tant religious events of women's lives. Further, an analysis of the content of these prayers can reveal how women understood their religious activity. A tkhine for lighting the Sabbath candles which contains prayers for the pro- tection of the woman's husband and children from evil spirits, or a descrip- tion of the candelabrum in the ancient Temple, shows some of the meanings that kindling the lights might hold. It is important to note that an analysis of the content of these prayers shows that there was a range of meanings attached to any one particular act: women's spirituality was far from mono- lithic. Finally, unlike Hebrew prayers, the tkhines contain many references to the matriarchs-Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah-and other women of the Bible and Midrash. By analyzing their portrayal of these female figures, we can discern the images of women and women's religious lives that the tkhine literature presents. Now let us step back for a moment, and ask what kind of answer-what kind of question-this approach represents. We might characterize it as "filling in the blanks." That is, there are certain "blank spaces" in the history of Judaism, blank spaces where the history of women ought to be, which need to be filled in. To use the title of Rachel Adler's well-known article, this approach tries to describe "the Jew who wasn't there."8 This is important to do, and much of my work so far on early modern Jewish women falls into this category. But it is also important to notice something about it: This way of understanding women's religion makes it a separate domain. Women's history is additive: It adds knowledge to an already exist- ing, albeit incomplete, history of Jewish religious life. "Women and Men Who Are Like Women" Perhaps, though, this is too narrow a context into which to set women's religion. With this we come to the second approach mentioned at the outset. Perhaps this women's Yiddish literature can best be understood as part of some broader category, a category which will give it a social location. And 8. Response 7, no. 22 (Summer 1973): 77-82.

In the first chapter of the Brantshpigl, for example, the author explains why he wrote the work in Yiddish: "The book was written in Yiddish for women and for men who are like women in not having much knowledge." This is the category nashim ve-'amei ha-ares, "women and the ignorant." To put it into more neutral terms, this literature, and the women's religious life which it represents, can be seen as being part of folk or popular religion, of the religious life of those who are not part of the educated elite. The attempt to set this material into a folk religious context can provide a way into a number of interesting issues. First, it raises at another level the question of the extent to which men were also an audience for this literature. Second, it raises the question of the relationship between this literature and various folk religious practices, which once again requires consideration of which practices were associated with women, which with men, and which with all the "folk." Finally, it lends itself to an exploration of issues of the sociology of religious knowledge: What kinds of things could ordinary Jews know? Is there a difference between the religious knowledge of women and of "men who are like women in not having much knowledge"? To turn to the question of audience. To what extent does it make sense to group together women and "ignorant" men? For Catholic devotional litera- ture in early modern France, the important distinction is between the clergy, who used Latin, and the laity, who used the vernacular, French.9 One could argue that in Judaism, the relevant distinction is between women and men, since there is no sacramentally and ritually set-apart clergy, and all men are potential participants in elite religious culture. But in actuality, many, perhaps most, men did not acquire enough knowledge to take part in rabbinic culture in any but the most perfunctory ways. Traditional Ash- kenazic society was highly stratified, and power and knowledge were concentrated in the hands of an interlocking elite of the wealthy and/or the learned. 0 Thus, it is indubitable that those men who could not read the classics of Jewish tradition in the original Hebrew and Aramaic did form part of the audience for the vernacular popular religious literature. It seems, though, 9. Conversations with Natalie Davis and Virginia Reinburg about French devotional literature were very helpful to me. See Reinburg's doctoral dissertation, "Popular Prayers in Late Medieval and Reformation France" (Princeton University, 1985). 10.

For social stratification, see especially pp. 199-209.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 79 that we can make distinctions between the genres associated more with men and more with women. The tkhines and the Tsenerene (a collection of homi- lies on the biblical portion of the week, a work which was reprinted so fre- quently that it might be considered a genre in itself)" were women's genres, although there are a few tkhines meant to be recited by men, and many men as children listened to their mothers reading from the Tsenerene.'2 On the other hand, apart from the Brantshpigl and some guides to the observance of women's commandments in particular,"3 the Yiddish ethical literature was addressed either to men and women equally, or primarily to men. The title page of Isaac ben Eliakum's Lev Tov, first published in Prague in 1620, begins: All you men and women, And all who are fashioned by the Creator Who wish to build this world and the other for themselves, Come, all of you, and look at this splendid book. I believe no one will be sorry Who reads it through completely. One will find in it all of Judaism In its length and in its breadth, Quite understandable and well explained, Extending over twenty chapters.'4 As Israel Zinberg notes, the author of the Lev Tov repeatedly addresses his audience as "householders and women."'5 The Qav ha-yashar, a kabbalistic morality book written by Tsvi Hirsh Koidonover, published in 1706, in Hebrew and Yiddish, addresses itself to men, but there is evidence that it 11. On the Tsenerene, see Khone Schmeruk, "Di Mizrekh-eyropeishe nuskhoes fun der Tsenerene (1786-1850)," in For Max Weinreich on His Seventieth Birthday (The Hague: Mouton, 1964), pp. 320-336. 12. For example, Yosef Svirski, in his article on Jewish life in Vilna, "Zikhronot shel yerushalyim de-lita" (Yeda' 'am 33-34 [1967/68]: 108-116), writes: "The book Tsenerene, the Torah in Yiddish for women, played an important role in our culture in past generations. Our mothers used to sit on every Sabbath after the afternoon nap, and read it aloud, chanting, with emphasis. And we children would listen sometimes, to hear the beautiful parables and the words of explanation, which the author would quote in the names of the commentators on the Torah" (p. 109). 13. On these guides, see Segal, "Sifrey migvot ha-nashim be-yidish." 14. Translation from Zinberg, History, 7:160. 15. Ibid., p. 161. "Householders" (balebatim) are, of course, hardly the bottom of the social scale.</page><page sequence="8">80 CHAVA WEISSLER was also read by women.'6 Thus, the generic distribution of this literature among men and women gives some evidence that the category of "women and ignorant men" makes a certain amount of sense, but also that one can make distinctions between men and women. That in some ways women and men participated in separate phases of popular religion while in others they partook of a common popular religious culture is also borne out by the references in the Yiddish devotional material to acts of folk religious origin. These popular religious practices were not required by halakhah, and at times were even frowned upon by the rab- binical authorities. Some of these practices were particularly associated with women. The Shloyshe she'orim, a book of tkhines attributed to a woman known as Sore bas Tovim, contains a long prayer for the making of memorial candles for the dead, something women usually did on the eve of Yom Kippur.'7 The prayer refers to the making of the candles as a mi4vah, a divine commandment: Although the elite may not have considered it obliga- tory, the women-or the folk-did. Two other such women's practices are the following (the first of these seems to reflect an oral tradition): The Tsenerene and also an early collection 16. I. L. Peretz, in his short story, "A Farshterter shabes," in his Ale verk, vol. 2, Dertseylungen, mayselekh, bilder (New York: Cyco Bikher-Farlag, 1947), pp. 211-219, lists the devotional works read by a traditional Jewish woman: "Seril is an accomplished woman; she reads ivre-taytsh [the special variety of Yiddish in which this literature was written] fluently: She knows the Taytsh-khumesh [i.e., the Tsenerene] and the Qav ha-yashar and the Reyshis khokme and other such books.. ." (p. 214). 17. It is unclear whether Sore bas Tovim was a historical or a legendary personage. Despite the fact that, in the 1860s, her name was attached to newly written tkhines, both Niger ("Di yidishe literatur," pp. 82-85) and Zinberg (History, 7:253-256) reach the conclusion that she actually existed and was the author of the Shloyshe she'orim. Basing himself primarily on autobiographical information contained in this text and another work which he considers genuine, Zinberg concludes that she lived in the first few decades of the eighteenth century. The earliest extant editions of the Shloyshe she'orim were published without notation of date or place of publication. The earliest dated edition I have seen is in the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem; it was published in Vilna: Romm, 1838. Because the text of the Shloyshe she'orim as we have it contains material from S. Hemdat yamim (see n. 26 below), it is probably no earlier than 1742, or perhaps 1731. There is extensive ethnographic documentation, from a somewhat later period, of the prac- tice of making memorial candles for the dead; see the references in Weissler, "Traditional Piety of Ashkenazic Women." Ashkenazic women engaged in candle making at a much earlier period as well. Dulcia (d. 1197) is described by her husband, R. Eleazar b. Judah of Worms, as making wicks for the synagogue and school, and preparing candles for Yom Kippur. R. Eleazar's moving poem in memory of Dulcia is translated and analyzed in Ivan G. Marcus, "Mothers, Martyrs, and Moneymakers: Some Jewish Women in Medieval Europe," Conservative Judaism, Spring 1986.</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 81 of tkhines, the Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes,'8 include a prayer said by women when biting off the end of the etrog (citron) on the holiday of Hoshana Rabba, a practice which was supposed to make for an easier childbirth. In the prayer, the woman expressly repudiates Eve's sin of eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (thought by some rabbis to have been a citron), and implies that therefore she ought not suffer the consequences. Second, the Sefer ha-.ayyim,19 a collection of prayers and practices connected with the sick, dying, and dead, and with cemetery visits, contains a prayer to be said when measuring graves in times of distress, another women's practice. Women measured the grave, or the entire circumference of the cemetery, with candle-wicking, and made it into candles which were donated to the synagogue or house of study. While all of these practices seem unambiguously associated with women, there are others which are less so. The Sefer ha-hayyim and another collec- tion of cemetery prayers, the Ma'aneh lashon,20 both have versions in Hebrew and versions in Yiddish, versions for women and for men, "folkier" and "less folky" aspects. These collections turn out to be splendidly ambi- guous in relation to all these categories. The Yiddish of the Ma'aneh lashon seems-but not completely-to be intended for men, not women, while the Hebrew version of this work seems to reflect a "folkier" view of the relation- ship of the living and the dead than does the Yiddish of the Sefer ha-bayyim, which seems to be intended for women. And the Sefer ha-.ayyim, while in general taking a more "elite" line than the Ma'aneh lashon (i.e., by dis- couraging graveside prayers to the dead), also includes instructions for keeping demons away from a corpse, stories about what to do if you see the dead in your dreams, explanations about how the dead know all that goes on in the world of the living, and instructions to bury a sheet or diaper with a woman who died in childbirth, so that she can care for her dead child in 18.

This material demonstrates the great complexity of the interrela- tionships between folk and elite religion, and between women's and men's religion. There is yet another issue which might be fruitfully explored as part of the consideration of women's religion in the framework of popular religion. This is the sociology of religious knowledge. What kinds of access did women, and unlearned men, have to the great literature of Judaism? If they could not understand Hebrew, what could they know by reading the Tsenerene, the morality literature, the tkhines, the stories? These Yiddish sources could give their readers access to fairly extensive Jewish knowledge, although not in the original languages (Hebrew and Aramaic). The Mayse bukh billed itself as "the Yiddish Gemara"; a large number of the stories it contains do originate in the Talmud.21 As the title page proclaims: A beautiful storybook. Come here, dear men and women, and examine this lovely storybook which, since the world has existed, has never appeared in print. With three hundred and some stories, all of which are made out of the Gemara, and also tales out of the Midrash Rabba and Bahya, and none of the stories of Rabbi Judah the Pious will you miss. Also tales out of Sefer Hasidim and Sefer Musar and the Yalkut, as you will see in the back in my listing. Therefore, dear women, before you had the German [i.e., Yiddish] books; now you will also have the German [i.e., Yiddish] Gemara. So you will have the entire Torah.

Even if one knows much Gemara, he will bring out of it midrashim and stories and legends so that the whole world will be astonished at him and every man will say: "I believe he knows the whole Torah on one foot. As he has such great erudition in the Gemara, I believe he knows the whole Torah. Who has seen his like?" To every situation he gives a law to be carried out in practice applicable to the 21.

Our sacred books write that it is a sin as big as a house to read [ungodly books] on the holy Sabbath day. If you wish to spend your time reading, I will write a lovely storybook. Therefore, dear women, buy it quickly before it goes away into foreign lands-to Bohemia, White Russia, and Poland.... Later you will say, Why did I not buy any when it was in the land?22 The Tsenerene quotes by name such popular biblical commentators as Rashi, Bahya ben Asher, and the Hizkuni. Readers of this literature could gain familiarity not only with the content of traditional sources, but also with the way in which traditional Jewish exegesis makes use of sources and structures an argument. For example, the chapter in the Brantshpigl which explains how women can talk their way into Eternal Life quotes a number of talmudic and midrashic proof-texts demonstrating that women as well as men can receive a heavenly reward; it also quotes opposing viewpoints and attempts to reconcile them. Considering all of this evidence, it seems clear that an "ordinary Jew," male or female, who read this literature could have considerable knowledge of both the content and style of the midrash, Bible commentaries, and the aggadic portions of the Talmud, and of a certain amount of halakhah.23 One of the issues here is that there is an elite deciding what it is appro- priate for the "folk" to know. This comes out in interesting ways with regard to the kabbalistic material, perhaps the most problematic sort of material for broad distribution. In the earlier stages of this literature, some pains were taken to exclude or minimize the material of kabbalistic origin. For example, Bahya ben Asher's commentary on the Torah includes the four standard types of Jewish exegesis: literal, homiletical, philosophical, and mystical. The author of the Tsenerene quotes Bahya copiously, yet always stops short of including the kabbalistic portions of Bahya's work.24 Similarly, the Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, while influenced, as Freehof has shown,25 by the mystical devotional literature in Hebrew, omits just that 23. Making halakhic materials available in Yiddish could be controversial; see Zinberg, History, 7:216-218, for a discussion of rabbinic reaction to publication of extracts from the Shulh.an 'Arukh as an appendix to Elhanan Kirchhan's Yiddish ethical work, Simkhas ha-nefesh.

Yet some Yiddish devotional, homiletical, and ethical material contains overt kabbalistic teaching, and in some cases deliberately undertakes the popularization of mystical materials. Thus, for example, the Shloyshe she'orim contains passages from the Zohar, and from S. Hemdat Yamim, a crypto-Sabbatian text-although without attribution.26 The S. Ma'asey Ha-shem and the Avir Ya'aqov, both compiled and translated by Simon Akiva Baer ben Joseph, consist of Yiddish (and Hebrew) translations of kabbalistic materials from a variety of sources, from the Zohar to the Shivhey ha-Ari. The Nakhlas Tsvi is a Yiddish translation of much of the Zohar, made by Tsvi Hirsch Chotsh, and published in 1711. Further the Qav ha-yashar, by Tsvi Hirsch Koidonover, is a morality book heavily influenced by the kabbalistic worldview. All of this literature is part of the great move to popularize Kabbalah which occurred in the wake of the Safed revival.27 An interesting question to investigate is the role of the Yiddish material in the popularization of the mystical tradition. Did the Yiddish material reach a wider public than the Hebrew? Are there differences between the presentation of kabbalistic material in the Yiddish sources and in the Hebrew (e.g., more stories in Yiddish, more theoretical material in 26. I discuss the transformations of one of the passages from the Zohar in the Shloyshe she'orim and other Yiddish popularizations in "Women in Paradise."

How did this popularized Kabbalah affect-and how was it affected by-popular religious practice?28 We have seen that it can be fruitful to consider women's Yiddish devo- tional literature within the framework of popular religion. Yet once again, let us stand back and ask what the problems are with this approach, and what kind of approach it is. There are several difficulties with considering Ashkenazic women's religious materials as part of folk or popular religion. First, to do so ignores the very real stratification among women, both in terms of wealth and in terms of knowledge. Those few women authors who can either be documented to have existed or who seem plausible from the evidence of their works were clearly learned far beyond the average woman. Sarah Rebecca Rachel Leah, daughter of Yokel Segal Horowitz,29 wrote her "Tkhine of the Matriarchs" in Aramaic, with an introduction in Hebrew, and her own Yiddish translation of the text. At the other end of the scale were the many women who could not read. Are they represented in this literature at all? There is evidence that such women had an oral tradition of devotions in the vernacular. To what extent did that oral tradition influence the written material that we have?30 Second, even if we pinpoint a particular social stratum, if we can identify the level of "popular religion" under discussion-the religious lives of those 28. Works concerning the sick, dying, and dead, such as the Sefer ha-bayyim and the Ma'aneh lashon (noted above), are a particularly fruitful field for investigating these questions. Another work which would repay study is the Ma'avar Yabboq, a Hebrew book containing prayers for the dying, a very interesting kabbalistic commentary on the care of the dying and the dead, and mourning practices. 29. On Sarah Rebecca Rachel Leah, see Hayim Lieberman, Ohel Rahel (New York, 1979/80), pp. 432-435; and S. Osar Sihot hakhamim (Bene Beraq, 1971/72; photo-offset of Sonik, 1911/12), pp. 42-43. In his memoirs, Ber of Bolechow (1723-1805) recalls meeting her when he was a boy of twelve, and notes her prowess at talmudic scholarship (Zikhronot [Berlin: Klal Verlag, 1922], p. 44). 30. The issue of the relationship of oral tradition to the written tkhines is addressed in an interchange between the folklorists S. Ansky and N. Prylucki. Prylucki's article, "Polemik: A tshuve eynem a retsenzent," in Noyekh Prilutskis zamelbikher far yidishenfolklor, filologye, un kulturgeshikhte, vol. 1 (Warsaw: Nayer Ferlag, 1912), pp. 154-166, is a response to Ansky's review of Prylucki's book Yidishe folkslider. Ansky criticized Prylucki for including as "folk- songs" material he regarded as stereotypical printed women's prayers. Prylucki quotes a portion of Ansky's review, which is of interest here: "Some of these [Yiddish women's] prayers are included in the women's prayerbooks and [books of] tkhines, but the majority of them circulate in oral tradition, possessing a multitude of variants." Ansky lists the following topics as particularly common for women's oral prayer: candle-lighting, separating dough for .allah, ritual immersion, "laying the wicks" for memorial candles for the dead, pregnancy, and entering the synagogue. Ansky's review appeared in Evreiskaya Starina, 1911, p. 591. I translate from Prylucki's Yiddish translation of portions of the review.</page><page sequence="14">86 CHAVA WEISSLER who could read Yiddish but were by and large not learned in Hebrew and in the texts of the elite tradition in their original language (not the bottom of the social scale by any means)-we still need to investigate the question of the relationship between men's religion and women's religion. Is there enough common ground so that we can say that there was a popular religion in which both men and women participated? Or, alternatively, if men's and women's nonelite religious practices, knowledge, devotions, and so forth, differed substantially from one another, does it add anything to our under- standing of them to include them both in the category "popular religion"?3' Finally, in the last analysis, this too is an "additive" approach to the study of women's religion. It simply broadens the category to be added. The picture of "normative" Judaism remains unchanged: We "fill in the blank" of popular religion. Women are subsumed under a category which is defined as being outside of what is usually studied as "Judaism." Further, consider- ing women's religion under the rubric of popular religion does not allow the history of women's experience to challenge our received assumptions about either "elite" or "popular" Judaism. Reconfiguring Ashkenazic Judaism Taking the third approach mentioned at the outset, the transformative approach, raises the question: How can what we learn about Ashkenazic women's religion reconfigure our understanding of Ashkenazic Judaism as a whole?32 The rewriting of history to incorporate the perspective of women's history presents us with a challenge. It begins with women, but its subject is gender.33 Making gender a category of analysis enables us to understand 31. Historians are calling into question the usefulness of the category "popular religion." See, for example, Peter Brown's critique of the "two-tiered system" (elite vs. popular religion) in The Cult of the Saints (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), esp. pp. 12-22, in which he traces our concept of popular religion to David Hume's essay, "The Natural History of Religion." For a critique of the concept of "popular religion" as used by historians of early modern Europe, see Natalie Zemon Davis's chapter, "From 'Popular Religion' to Religious Cultures," in Reformation Europe: A Guide to Research, ed. Steven Ozment (St. Louis: Center for Reformation Research, 1982). Also see her earlier essay, "Some Tasks and Themes in the Study of Popular Religion," in The Pursuit of Holiness in Late Medieval and Renaissance Europe, ed. Charles Trinkaus (Leiden: Brill, 1974), pp. 306-336. 32. One might argue, of course, that the additive is ultimately transformative, that adding something to an account inevitably changes that account in some fundamental way. 33.

Further, it reveals the cultural constructions, the structures and symbols, which defined and expressed Ashkenazic Judaism's specific visions of maleness and femaleness. At this point in my research, I can only raise some questions and suggest some directions in which work could go; I have not yet worked out the full transformation. Three possible areas of inquiry are the following. First, this approach sets men and women in rela- tion to one another. Thus it leads, for example, to the investigation of the distribution of domains of the religious life between women and men, and what this distribution tells us about the system as a whole. A specific area within this larger question is the differing views of the relationship of sexuality and the reproductive life to religious expression which one finds in men's and women's devotional literature. A second topic is the relationship of gender and power. Here, the very existence of the category "women and ignorant men" becomes the subject of analysis. A third direction for research is an inquiry into the cultural construction of gender. Two particu- larly interesting fields of investigation in this area include the morality litera- ture, with its prescriptions for proper behavior, and the images of women and men in the Yiddish devotional literature, especially the transformation of these images as they move from their original sources to the vernacular material. Let me discuss each of these in a little more detail. Since I have so far looked chiefly at the women's material, most of my examples will be drawn from the woman's perspective, but I shall try to suggest ways in which it can be juxtaposed with the "normative" view. First, the distribution of domains. The tkhine literature can give us a good sense of the domains and occasions of women's religious lives. Each tkhine comes with a title specifying when it is to be said; for example, "The woman says this when she puts the Sabbath loaf into the oven," "When a woman becomes pregnant, she should say this every day, or when she goes to give birth," "What one says when the cantor sings Sim shalom."34 About a third of prayers in one of the largest collec- tions of tkhines, Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, are connected with topics and places we might expect from a general knowledge of Jewish life: Sabbaths, holidays, fast-days, the synagogue. Others, while still concerning matters that were of some religious significance to men, seem to have distinctive significance for women: the New Moon, cemetery visits. There are also 34. Seyder tkhines (Amsterdam, 1752), p. 8b; Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes (Fuerth, 1762), nos. 95, 6.</page><page sequence="16">88 CHAVA WEISSLER prayers for the women's miSvot, for pregnancy and childbirth, and for such private concerns as the illness of a child or a widow's desire to remarry. All in all, the list of tkhines gives us the sense that women's religious lives were more private than men's: The majority of these prayers were meant to be recited when the woman wished, and in the home or some other private setting. Furthermore, the prayers are phrased in the singular, and some leave space for the woman to insert her own name as petitioner. This con- trasts with what we know of men's religious lives, which were carried on chiefly in public settings, such as the synagogue or house of study. The Hebrew liturgy is phrased primarily in the plural, and, by preference, should be recited communally. It is required and public, in contrast to the tkhines, which are voluntary and private. Yet is there a way to get past this overly neat distinction between the public and private spheres? One way to look for the answer to this question might be to examine the places where the domains cross or intersect. For example, what was the nature of the prayers women said in the synagogue (the tkhines, not just the regular liturgy), or the prayers husbands said during their wives' pregnancies? Why is it that cemeteries, which are, after all, public places, seem to be so important in women's religious lives? Some possible answers seem to point us back toward the private domain; many women's cemetery prayers were addressed to their dead relatives. This is still, in a way, keeping the family together. Also, the cemetery was public, but was only rarely, e.g., during funerals, the scene of public rituals.35 It may be that for cemetery devotions, the distinction between public and private simply breaks down. A particularly fruitful comparison, in this connection, is that between the tkhine literature, on the one hand, and the kabbalistic voluntary devo- tional literature in Hebrew for men which arose at about the same period, on the other. This literature, which, as mentioned above, had some influence on the tkhines, was similar to the tkhine literature in being voluntary, although a larger proportion of it was intended to be recited publicly, as part of a praying community. Indubitably private, however, were many of the prayers concerned with sexuality. The Sha'arey Siyyon, by Nathan Nata Hannover,36 contains prayers to be said before intercourse, asking God's aid 35. As mentioned above, cemeteries were also important arenas for men's piety, and it is often unclear whether particular collections of cemetery prayers were meant for the use of women or of men. 36. 1st ed. Prague, 1662. I have used the J6zefow, 1867, ed.</page><page sequence="17">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 89 in preventing impotence, and in ensuring male rather than female offspring. These prayers, which express a fear of sexual inadequacy, are more directly concerned with sexuality than the tkhines. The comparable cycle of tkhines, found in eighteenth-century editions of Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, has to do with the observance of niddah (menstrual avoidances), conception, preg- nancy, and childbirth. This material contains a strong conception of men- struation as impure, stresses God's justice in causing the sufferings of child- birth,37 and expresses the hope for sons, but finds daughters acceptable. It is far more concerned with the reproductive life than with sexuality. The closest the tkhines come to the subject of sexuality is the following, taken from a tkhine to be recited after ritual immersion: "Purify my heart and my thoughts that I may think no evil while my husband has intercourse with me, and may his whole deed be done in great purity, not wantonly or brazenly." The prayer then moves right on to conception: "Send me the good angel to wait in the womb to bring the seed before you, Almighty God, that you may pronounce [its fate]."38 From this emerges the interesting observation that women's devotional literature, though expressing chiefly private concerns, excludes the erotic, which was reserved for (relegated to?) men. This distinction is also borne out if we compare Hebrew and Yiddish ethical literature of the period. The Sheney luhot ha-berit by Isaiah Horowitz (d. 1628), for example, contains a lengthy discussion of whether or not one can atone for the sins of masturba- tion and nocturnal emission, for which harsh penances are prescribed, and counsels the reader as to how to avoid inappropriate sexual arousal. By contrast, while the Seyder mitsvas ha-noshim and the Brantshpigl both advise that intercourse be performed in a pure and modest manner, they seem to assume that women rarely have troubling sexual desires.39 How can we account for the absence of the erotic in women's materials and its strong 37. Perhaps to the point of muted protest? The text reads in part: "God and my king, you are merciful. Who can tell or know your justice or your judgment? They are as deep as brooks of water and the depths of springs. You punished Eve, our old Mother, because she persuaded her husband Adam to trespass against your commandment .... You spoke with anger that in sadness she would give birth. So we women must suffer each time, and have our regular periods, with heavy hearts. Thus, I have had my period, with a heavy heart and with sadness, and I thank your Holy Name and your judgment..." (Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, no. 91). 38. Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, no. 93. 39. The one such problem they do address is the possibility that the woman, as well as the man, may be thinking of someone other than the spouse during intercourse. Proper sexual behavior is discussed in the Seyder mitsvas ha-noshim (Basle, 1602) pp. 21a-22a (chaps. 72-73); and in the Brantshpigl (Hanau, 1626), chap. 38.

Or, to think about it in a slightly different way, this material seems to suggest that the populariza- tion of Kabbalah during this period needs to be understood in the context of male guilt and fear, on the one hand, and female lack of interest in or suppression of sexuality, on the other. The second transformative way to think about this material is to explore the relationship between gender and power. Here, as I indicated, we might start out by analyzing the category "women and men who are like women in not having much knowledge." In what contexts (halakhic, devotional, community structure, etc.) does this category make its appearance? This could lead into questions concerning the relationship of gender and class, and might provide a new way of looking at that problematic category, "popular religion," as well. In addition, within the Jewish community, knowledge was power, in a very particular sense. The community was headed by an interlocking aristocracy of wealthy and learned men. The distribution of knowledge, then, becomes a key to examining the distribu- tion of power as well. I have already discussed the question of what could be learned from the Yiddish sources. But in this connection, it might be inter- esting to take as a starting point the ambiguities of audience. So many of these works have title pages or introductions which start out by addressing men and women, and switch to women, or vice versa; or which address the masses in one breath and the elite in the next. The example of the Mayse bukh was cited above. The cemetery prayers are equally ambiguous. For whom, exactly, was what knowledge intended? Third, let us consider how the perspectives gained from the study of women's religion can contribute to our understanding of the cultural con- struction of gender in Ashkenazic Jewish society. Just taking this approach transforms some of the methodological difficulties with the literature under investigation into interesting points of departure. In the ethical literature, we were worried about the relationship of the prescriptive to the actual. Yet now the prescriptions themselves become the object of analysis. In addition, it would be fruitful to compare the ethical literature in Yiddish addressed to women with that addressed to men, and with the Hebrew ethical literature 40. For discussions of the erotic element in kabbalistic symbolism, see Gershom Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York: Schocken, 1965), esp. chaps. 3 and 4; idem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, esp. chap. 6; and Zohar: The Book of Enlightenment, transla- tion and introduction by Daniel Chanan Matt (New York: Paulist Press, 1983), passim.</page><page sequence="19">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 91 for men, to see whether conceptualizations of male and female roles and behavior vary from one to another. The Brantshpigl addresses the question of how to be a good wife, while the Lev Tov offers counsel on how to be a good husband. How do the descriptions compare? Do they "match"? Are they reciprocal? Are they symmetrical or asymmetrical? In another genre, the cemetery prayers, the prayers said by wife and husband at the grave of the deceased spouse, are startlingly asymmetrical. The husband asks his wife's pardon for his occasional outbursts of temper, and expresses the hope that she will not hold a grudge against him, but will intercede before the Throne of Glory for him and their children. The wife's prayer, by contrast, is full of expressions of grief and loss, totally absent from the husband's prayer.4' These examples from the morality literature and the cemetery prayers, prescriptive or idealized as they might be, have to do with the concrete rela- tions of real men and women. What of the mythical images, the role models, the portraits of the patriarchs and matriarchs, for example? Unlike the Hebrew liturgy and the Hebrew kabbalistic devotional literature, which refer almost exclusively to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other male biblical heroes, the tkhines also make frequent reference to the matriarchs and other biblical women. The different ways in which these women (and men) are portrayed suggest both the hallowing of women's traditional roles and the possibilities for transcending gender categories. Particularly interesting in this regard is the selection and transformation of motifs from midrashic and kabbalistic sources. Thus, for example, Sore bas Tovim's long prayer for making memorial candles for the dead calls on the aid of a whole string of biblical figures. The patriarchs, although not the male figures who appear without female partners, are portrayed as the passive recipients of God's aid. "As I lay the third thread of the wick for our father Abraham, whom you saved from the fiery furnace," runs the text, "so may you purify us of our sins and trespasses." The matriarchs, by contrast, are pictured both exclusively as mothers and as advocates for their children and by extension for the people of Israel. Because of the pain Sarah felt as Isaac was led to be bound on the altar, "may she be an advocate for us before God, be blessed, that we may not this year be widowed, God forbid, nor our children taken away from the world during our lives." This tkhine 41. S. Ma'aneh lashon (Amsterdam, 1723) pp. 63b-66b (nos. 19-20). There were prayers to be recited at the graves of a whole spectrum of relatives, from maternal or paternal grand- parents down to little children. These can help us to understand how all of these different family roles were conceptualized.</page><page sequence="20">92 CHAVA WEISSLER affirms the value and power inherent in the traditional woman's role of mothering.42 A further point here is that midrashic material, in the aggre- gate, certainly does not portray the patriarchs as passive, in contrast to active matriarchs. Yet this text, by selecting among midrashic motifs, puts together a picture that gives precisely that impression. Can this be seen as subversion of traditional roles within their ostensible reaffirmation? Muted protest? Or just a woman's-eye view of actual roles in the family? Further investigation is required. Yet other tkhines suggest the possibility of transcending traditional roles. In one prayer, for example, the woman lighting Sabbath candles identifies herself with the High Priest, an unexpected association.43 Perhaps the best example of the transcending of categories comes from a description of the women's Paradise, which originates in the Zohar, the classic work of medieval Jewish mysticism, and appears in a number of Yiddish versions: within a tkhine, as a story, in a collection of translations of kabbalistic material.44 All of these versions change the original in significant ways. To summarize the differences briefly, the Zohar, while honoring righteous women in general and certain heroic women of the Bible (Pharaoh's daughter, Seralh daughter of Asher, Jocheved, Miriam, Deborah, and the matriarchs) in particular, makes it quite clear that even in Paradise, women retain their subordinate status. Their radiant heavenly garments do not shine quite as brightly as men's robes. Further, three times a day, Pharaoh's daughter and Seralh pay homage to the forms of Moses and Joseph, respec- tively, saying, "Happy is my lot that I brought up this light," and "Happy was the day when I brought Jacob the news that Joseph lived."45 Along with 42. For a fuller discussion of this text, as well as of a literary description of its recitation, see Weissler, "Traditional Piety of Ashkenazic Women." 43. Seyder tkhines u-vakoshes, no. 47. 44. The original description occurs in the Zohar III, p. 167b (parashat shelat lekha). The extant Yiddish versions include: Nakhlas Tsvi, by Tsvi Hirsch Chotsch (Lublin, 1893), pp. 180-181 (first published in 1711); S. Ma'asey Ha-shem, by Simon Akiva Ber ben Joseph (Amsterdam: Proops, 1723), pp. 15a-b (pt. 2, which contains this passage, was first published in 1694); a "story" appearing as a separate section in several books (including "Ma'aseh gadol me-Rabi Shimon bar Yohai," appended to S. 'Olam ha-ba [Hanau, 1620], pp. 7a-8b; "Ayn vunder sheyn mayse oyz den Zohar parshas Lekh Lekha [sic]," which is followed by another brief tale [Prague, ca. 1665]; and "Ayn sheyn mayse oyz den Zohar parshas Lekh Lekha [sic]," printed as an addendum to Ayn sheyn getlikh lid Orah .layyim [Fuerth, 1692-98]); and part of the prayer for the Blessing of the New Moon in the tkhine collection attributed to Sore bas Tovim, the Shloyshe she'orim. 45. Serah, daughter of Asher, is mentioned in the Bible only in genealogical lists (Gen. 46:17, Num. 26:46, 1 Chron. 7:3). However, the midrash portrays her as gently breaking the news that Joseph was alive by playing the harp and singing about it so that Jacob could hear</page><page sequence="21">RELIGION OF TRADITIONAL ASHKENAZIC WOMEN 93 singing praises to God, the women in Paradise occupy themselves with studying the reasons for the commandments, particularly those they were unable (because they were women) to perform during their earthly lives. In almost all of the Yiddish versions, by contrast, the little detail about the women's garments is omitted. When this motif appears in a tkhine, Pharaoh's daughter bows down to the form of Moses, and says, "How worthy is my strength and how knowing is my power! I drew such a light out of the water, I brought up this dear light!" Similarly for Serah: "Praised is my strength, and how worthy is my power!" Finally, most of the Yiddish versions state that women in Paradise "study Torah," two texts saying explicitly "just like men." By transforming the original text, these Yiddish versions allowed the reader to imagine herself in a radically different situa- tion from that in which she lived: reciting these prayers or reading these stories, a woman could picture herself surrounded by other righteous women, unconcerned with her roles as wife and mother, devoting herself to studying Torah and praising God. All of this suggests that in order to delineate the images of the religious life to which women and men could aspire, we need to consider the original text-the Zohar-and its transformations. These texts were part of the popularization of the Kabbalah during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is significant that it is precisely the Yiddish materials- mysticism for the masses-which contained a more positive image of women.46 Nor can we give the simplistic explanation that the Yiddish ver- sions are naturally favorable to women because they were written for a female audience. Most of the changes mentioned above were first intro- duced by a male author, Simon Akiva Ber ben Joseph, in his Sefer Ma'asey Ha-shem, which was addressed primarily to (male) householders, but, with characteristic ambiguity, toward the end of the introduction, also to women. A careful study of the distribution and readership of the various versions (including the original) of this story, which seems to have become something of a touchstone image, will enable us to delineate the range of ways in which women's spiritual potential was imagined among Ashkenazic Jews.47 ? (Sefer ha-Yashar, Va-yiggash). For a discussion of the figure of Seral in the midrash, see Joseph Heinemann, Aggadot ve-toldotehen (Jerusalem: Keter, 1974), pp. 56-63. 46. However, nineteenth-century versions of these texts tend to change or omit the asser- tion that women studied Torah, or otherwise dilute the expressions of women's power found in some of the earlier versions. 47. These issues are discussed more fully in Weissler, "Women in Paradise."</page><page sequence="22">94 CHAVA WEISSLER We have seen that all three approaches to the study of women's religion can make important contributions to the study of the religious lives of Ashkenazic women. Yet our discussion of the third approach, the trans- formative, suggests that viewing women's religion as an addition alongside men's religion, or subsuming it under the rubric of popular religion, limits the full insight to be gained from the investigation of women's religious lives. Viewing Ashkenazic Judaism as a system which incorporates both men and women allows us to move beyond a mere static delineation of "the woman's role in Judaism." Thus, for example, our discussion of the trans- formation of midrashic and zoharic motifs suggests a more dynamic picture, one in which women and men, folk and elite, made use of the sources and resources of Judaism to create a culture with many and complex images of men's and women's religious roles and spiritual aspirations. The analysis of these motifs, and other similar materials, can show us that Ashkenazic Judaism itself offered multiple possibilities for the cultural construction of gender, possibilities which can still be explored and reclaimed.
