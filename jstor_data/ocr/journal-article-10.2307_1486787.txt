<plain_text><page sequence="1">Emanuel Feldman and Joel B. Wolowelsky, eds. Jewish Law and the New Reproductive Technologies. Hoboken, N.J.: KTAV, 1997. vii, 186 pp. This anthology presents eight essays from the Orthodox journal Tradition that address selected issues related to reproduction and responses to infertility. This description suggests some of the value, as well as the limitations, of the work. Positively, the essays in the volume represent some of the most valuable writings available (especially in English) on halakhah and these topics. They are thorough and well documented, with extensive references to classical sources and contemporary Orthodox halakhic writings, many of which are not readily accessible to most readers. On the whole, the essays are clearly written, conveying a good sense of the character and intricacies of this literature, as well as the intellectual skill and creativity manifested within this traditional discourse. A number of the essays strike me as especially strong. Yoel Jakobovits, a physician, discusses "Male Infertility: Halakhic Issues in Investigation and Management." He nicely contextualizes the discussion by beginning with personal and social aspects of "the longing for children," and concluding with attention to spiritual and psychological 'responses to infertility. Throughout the essay, Jakobovits presents clear descriptions of medical causes of and treatments for infertility, and varied Orthodox responses. Perhaps the central issue in traditional halakhic thought, in light of the traditional prohibition of masturbation, is the collection of semen for infertility testing (or the use of reproductive technologies). Here Jakobovits provides a nice sense of the historical development of varying strands in the tradition. He surveys</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 437 the views of contemporary authorities, and concludes with a ruling that masturbation is to be avoided, but could be acceptable as a last resort in this context. One intriguing halakhic issue raised by reproductive technologies is the determination of maternal identity when one woman gestates and gives birth to a child that derives in part from an egg provided by another woman. This could occur in a case of ovum donation, or, less frequently, gestational surrogate motherhood. No fewer than four of the eight essays are devoted largely or entirely to this topic. J. David Bleich's "In Vitro Fertilization: Questions of Maternal Identity and Conversion" offers a masterful survey of dozens of halakhic writings on this topic. Bleich manages to present the intricacies of the competing arguments and analogies marshaled to support the positions that birth, gestation, genetic connection, more than one of the above, or none of the above determines maternal identity. A weak point in this carefully argued article is Bleich's assertion that, even if genetic origin does not entail a maternal relationship, Jews should not donate ova to help non-Jews have children. "The permissibility of such a donation is far from clear and, at the very minimum, the procedure is contrary to the ideological norms of Judaism" (p. 68). In support, he provides only one talmudic citation objecting to helping the birth of idolaters. Even aside from the ethical concerns that many of us would raise, it seems far from obvious that a restriction on helping idolaters would apply to Christians or secularists in contemporary nations like the United States. Given the complexity of traditional halakhic views, one might have expected more of an argument for this applicability, or citation of halakhic sources drawing this conclusion. Additional essays address "Sperm Banking in Anticipation of Infertility" (including more general issues of artificial insemination), and offer a historical overview of selected aspects of embryology in Western and rabbinic thought. Finally, Yitzchok Breitowitz discusses "Halakhic Approaches to the Reso- lution of Disputes Concerning the Disposition of Preembryos." Breitowitz begins with a helpful overview of the medical and legal background of in vitro fertilization (IVF). He explores five halakhic models for addressing such disputes, and argues effectively for a model of partnership, drawing on analogies from halakhic discourse on business partnerships that reflect traditional understandings of equity. Some of the volume's limitations are simply those chosen by the editors in delimiting their work. Not surprisingly, these essays from Tradition reflect mainstream Orthodox views. There are no contributions by more heterodox</page><page sequence="3">438 BOOK REVIEWS Orthodox thinkers like Noam Zohar, Conservative thinkers like David Feld- man or Elliot Dorff, Reform views like those reflected in the collections of Reform responsa edited by Walter Jacob, or other Jewish voices. Moreover, with the exception of a few references to Feldman, none of these thinkers is represented among the hundreds of sources referenced in the endnotes. Secular and non-Jewish ethical writings are cited only rarely. All writers are of course entitled to write following the practices of their own communities of discourse as they define them. Still, in my view, more extensive engagement with divergent views would have enriched the essays. It also would have made then more helpful for readers not themselves firmly entrenched in Orthodox discourse, but interested in learning from and being challenged by these voices. Other omissions stem less from ideology than from the parameters of the volume, as a collection of essays that appeared in a given journal. Some of the most helpful presentations of Orthodox views on reproductive technologies have been offered by Richard Grazi and Wolowelsky, one of this volume's editors. Yet because they appeared in various medical journals instead of Tradition, they are not in the volume. A more general limitation relates to the topics discussed. A reader approaching a volume entitled Jewish Law and the New Reproductive Technologies might expect to encounter a reasonably full discussion of artificial insemination with a husband's sperm, artificial insemination with donor sperm, IVF, surrogate motherhood, and so forth. There is nothing nearly so systematic in this volume. For example, while seventy-five pages are devoted to maternal identity following ova donation in IVF, general issues of IVF are mentioned only in passing in scattered paragraphs. A reader desiring a more comprehensive presentation of Jewish law and reproductive technologies, instead of or in addition to these more particular essays, might turn to Richard V. Grazi, ed., Be Fruitful and Multiply (Jerusalem: Genesis, 1994); Elliot N. Dorff, Matters of Life and Death (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1998); or Michael Gold, And Hannah Wept (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1988). The essays in Jewish Law and the New Reproductive Technologies lack the breadth of these works, but offer impressive depth in the topics discussed. For the reader who is already familiar with traditional halakhic views in this area and wants to explore some issues in greater depth, or who has a special interest in the issues that are covered in the volume, or who simply wants examples of how Orthodox halakhic approaches operate, this volume provides valuable resources.
