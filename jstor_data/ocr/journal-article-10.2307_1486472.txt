The formation of culture in two different political, intellectual, and social contexts may indicate the unfolding of two different Judaisms. To what degree are these developments unique to their own contexts and to what degree are they related? To explore these questions CJS will sponsor two independent but related fellowship groups: Israeli Culture and Society: The Formative Period With the establishment of the State of Israel, a radical transformation took place in the life of world Jewry: the Jews "returned to history." This group will investigate how the first generation of Israelis consciously and unconsciously shaped their culture within the context of Jewish sovereignty. What were the perceptions, roles, and agendas expressed by the veteran population and the new immigrants, the religious and the secular, the Israeli Arabs and the Diaspora Jews? To what extent was the new state continuous with the Jewish past and what did it share with Europe and new states in an era of decolonization? Responses to these questions are invited from students of literature, the arts, historians, and social scientists. Jewish Religion and Culture in the American Diaspora, 1920-1970 The intimate interaction of Jewish religion and culture in the Diaspora forms the premise of much contemporary scholarship on Jews and Judaism in the pre-modem world and influences many of the best studies of modem Judaism and Jewry with one significant exception: the American experience. Jews seeking to present themselves as simply Americans abet this process and hinder understanding of Jewish creativity in American culture, one particularly open to religious influences and Diaspora consciousness. How has American culture produced by Jews on the national stage addressed simultaneously American and Jewish concerns and audiences? How have American Jews invented and reinvented Judaism as they created American cultural norms, images, and forms? What distinctions can be drawn between the Jewish experience of modernity and the Jewish experience of America? Each group will consist of 6-8 fellows. The Center invites applications from scholars engaged in all fields of Judaic studies and from scholars in other fields interested in approaching either of the topics from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective. Outstanding graduate students in the final stages of writing their dissertations may also apply. Stipend amounts are based on a Fellow's academic standing and financial need with a maximum of $30,000 for the academic year. A contribution may also be made towards travel expenses. Awards will be announced on January 30, 1996. The Center invites proposals for group research topics for the 1997-98 year. Proposals must be submitted by February 15, 1996.

THE BURNT BOOK Reading the Talmud MARC-ALAIN OUAKNIN Translated from the French by Llewellyn Brown In a profound look at what it means for new generations to read and interpret ancient religious texts, rabbi and philosopher Marc-Alain Ouaknin offers a postmodern reading of the Talmud, one of the first of its kind. Combining traditional learning and contemporary thought, Ouaknin dovetails discussions of spirituality and religious practice with such concepts as deconstruction, intertextuality, undecidability, multiple voicing, and eroticism in the Talmud. "By drawing not only on Derrida, but also on Blanchot, Jabbs, Neher, and Levinas, Marc-Alain Ouaknin has broadened the concepts and themes for viewing the relation of literary theory with Jewish thought. Moreover, his readings of Talmudic texts are rich and exciting, going beyond much of the best work in this field."-Robert Gibbs A Selection of the Jewish Book Club Cloth: $29.95 ISBN 0-691-03729-9 Due June 1995 PATHS OF EMANCIPATION Jews, States, and Citizenship EDITED BY PIERRE BIRNBAUM AND IRA KATZNELSON Throughout the nineteenth century, legal barriers to Jewish citi- zenship were lifted in Europe, enabling organized Jewish communities and individuals to alter radically their relationships with the institutions of the Christian West. In this volume, eight leading historians analyze the course of emancipation in Holland, Germany, France, England, the United States, and Italy as well as in Turkey and Russia. The goal is to produce a systematic study of the highly diverse paths to emancipation and to explore their different impacts on Jewish identity, dispositions, and patterns of collective action. In addition to the editors, the contributors are Geoffrey Alderman, Hans Daalder, Werner E. Mosse, Aron Rodrigue, Dan V. Segre, and Michael Stanislawski.

WOLFSON A comprehensive treatment of visionary experience in some of the main texts of Jewish mysticism, this book reveals the overwhelmingly visual nature of religious experience in Jewish spirituality from antiquity through the late Middle Ages. Using phenomenological and critical historical tools, Elliot Wolfson examines Jewish mystical texts from late antiquity, pre- kabbalistic sources from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, and twelfth- and thirteenth-century kabbalistic literature. "The book is a dazzling accomplishment, a landmark study from one of our most gifted scholars."-Elliot Ginsburg Cloth: $49.50 ISBN 0-691-07343-0 New paperback edition THE LEGEND OF THE BAAL-SHEM MARTIN BUBER Translated by Maurice Friedman The Jewish philosopher Martin Buber spoke directly to the most profound human concerns in all his works, including his discussions of Hasidism, the mystical-religious movement founded in Eastern Europe by Israel ben Eliezer, called the Baal-Shem (the Master of God's Name). Here Buber offers a sensitive and intuitive account of Hasidism, followed by twenty stories about the life of the Baal-Shem.

LEVENSON This paperback edition brings to a wide audience one of the most innovative and meaningful models of God for this post-Auschwitz era.
