Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993. 730 pp</page><page sequence="2">308 BOOK REVIEWS Communal histories have formed an integral part of Hungarian Jewish historiography since its inception over a century ago. One of the earliest seminal works on Hungarian Jewry, a history of Rohonc by Meir Zipser, was the first of dozens of communal histories that followed. Zipser, recognizing that a shortage of rabbinic literature had prevented historians of European Jewry from examining Jewish life in Hungary beyond the broad strokes of royal charters, used a wide array of materials from the municipal archive to paint a more detailed and comprehensive picture of Jewish life. During the ensuing half-century, dozens of scholars--some historians by profession, others by avocation-entered the local archives in their hometowns and authored historical works of similar genre. On the eve of the Second World War, one would have been hard pressed to find a Jewish community that had not been the subject of, at the very least, a journal article, and many communities had been treated in full-length monographs. Zahava Szasz Stessel's history of Abatijszaint6 is the latest contribution to a century-long tradition of Hungarian communal history writing, and one of the few in English. The events of the interwar period and the Second World War shifted the focus of Hungarian communal histories. Prior to the Great War, the authors of such works devoted considerable attention to illuminating the long and harmonious relationship between Jews and their gentile neighbors. Works written after the war, whether by 6migres residing in the United States or Israel or by Jews living in Hungary, typically pass quickly over pre-twentieth century events and proceed with alacrity to the rise of antisemitism after World War I and the horrors of the Nazi occupation. One of the strengths of this work is the fact that it examines the dramatic events of the twentieth century without ignoring earlier developments. Moreover, the author, a native of Abadijszaint6, balances between the broader history of her former Jewish community and her personal experiences and recollections. Recognizing the importance of memory in the study of history, and that history and memory complement one another in furthering an understanding the past, Stessel uses both in reconstructing the last two centuries of this Hungarian Jewish community. Her memories and experiences breathe life and nuance into what would otherwise be a dry collection of archival data and communal protocols. At the same time, her archival research grounds her personal involvement in the community in the context of Jewish and Hungarian history. Stessel follows a fairly conventional script. She begins with a brief</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 309 description of the Tokay Valley, the arrival of the Magyars in the tenth century, the founding of the town in the thirteenth century, and the oldest extant documentary evidence. Then she recounts the arrival of Jews in successive waves from Austria, Bohemia and Moravia, and Poland, and the organization of a Jewish community in Abaiijszant6 around an affluent, well-connected Jew. After sporadic settlement in the eighteenth century and the beginnings of Jewish communal life in the 1760s, a slow process of economic amelioration follows during the first half of the nineteenth century, culminating in a golden age ushered in by political emancipation and economic growth. Alongside this tale of economic success, Stessel describes the triumph of religious orthodoxy in Abatijszaint6, and the cultural implications of this development for the local rabbinate, schools, and other communal institutions. In addition, Stessel provides her readers with a rare and refreshing glimpse of Jewish life in Hungary that neither dwells on Jewish life in Budapest nor parades the accomplishments of Hungarian Jews in medicine, music, film, literature, and other areas of culture and science. While she digresses briefly in this direction, she quickly returns to her primary objective: the history of a single Jewish community. Throughout, she presents abundant information on a broad array of topics that ranges from rabbis and scholars to Jewish actors and composers, and consistently places this diverse collection of facts in a broader Hungarian Jewish context. For this reason, the book is a useful reference tool both for newcomers to the study of Hungarian Jewry and for more informed readers. Earlier chapters provide newcomers with a feel for the general contours of Hungarian Jewish history, while the middle section of the book homes in on more specific topics in the institutional and cultural life of Hungarian Jewry. Those interested in the history of the Kehilla, the rabbinate, and educational institutions will find the chapters on these topics especially stimulating. Although she presents a thorough chronology, however, Stessel only rarely addresses broader issues in the history of Hungarian Jewry. Her discussion of educational institutions, for example, thoroughly acquaints her readers with the possibilities for education in an Orthodox community. But there is little or no attempt to move beyond local history and address the broader education-related controversies that divided Hungary in the 1850s and 1860s. Similarly, in discussing the rabbinate, she recounts the moving life and times of Rabbi Eleazar L6w but has little to say regarding his role in the conflict between progressives and traditionalists, despite the fact that Abatijszant6</page><page sequence="4">310 BOOK REVIEWS lay at a crossroads of ideological currents emanating from Pressburg, Pest, Galicia, and Moravia. When Stessel turns to the twentieth century, she skillfully weaves a compelling tapestry of historical facts and memories. Describing the effects of World War I, she recalls: Life during the war was difficult for Abauijszaint6 citizens. The army needed the town's manpower and expropriated all available means of transportation. A total of 816 soldiers from the town participated in World War One. Many fathers served with their sons, and their horses and carriages also were pressed into service. My grandmother R6za Szisz's husband, her only son, two horses, and the family carriage were taken. She remained alone with her watchdog until the army tried to "draft" it for service as well. Only after petitions and her touching pleas was her dog allowed to remain with her. (p. 165) Equally compelling are her recollections of the forced labor of the World War II years, which she tempers with a keen historical eye. In many units, Jews were treated brutally and inhumanely. They were generally ill-clothed and inadequately fed. One of my profound childhood fears was of my father being called for labor service. The sight of a mailman with special delivery letters was sufficient to interrupt my play. I breathlessly watched the official until he passed our home. When the summons to report finally came in 1942, my father, who was stationed in a nearby village, was prepared to break a leg under the wheels of a horse-drawn carriage in order to avoid being transported abroad. .... His case was only one example of the many other desperate acts contemplated by Hungarian Jewish men to avoid the dreaded forced labor. (p. 189) In the end, however, this is not simply another communal history racing toward tragedy and destruction. The author, in fact, exercises remarkable restraint and balance in describing her experience during World War II, and, appropriately, she concludes by linking the tragic end of her community with its beginnings two centuries earlier. Abaiijszint6 was once a thriving town that engendered Jewish creativity in the arts, folklore, and other aspects of culture. Now it is an ordinary rural community. The atmosphere of emptiness recalls the underdeveloped site the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 311 first Jewish settlers found over two centuries ago. Only the faded epitaphs of eminent scholars and rabbis in the Jewish cemetery sustain the memory of its lost grandeur, of one of Hungary's most charming, and historically significant, rural Jewish communities. (pp. 238-239) Thus, in accordance with her goal, Zahava Stessel has retrieved this ostensibly obscure Jewish community from the dustbin of history, while preserving the memory of her own experience. Writing in 1879, Hungarian Maskil-turned-historian Joseph Bergl lamented the minimal attention that Hungarian Jewry received in the historical surveys of the Jewish people that had appeared by that time, specifically in the works of Basnage, Jost, and Graetz.' One hundred and twenty years later, Raphael Patai echoes this sentiment in the opening lines of this massive survey, adding Shimon Dubnow to the list of negligent historians. There was, of course, significant progress during the century between Bergl and Patai. In addition to several generations of historical scholarship in Hungary, a number of works appeared in more accessible languages, including a few in English: an article on Hungary in the Encyclopaedia Judaica, Nathaniel Katzburg's monograph on Hungarian Jewry as part of the Pinkesei Ha-Kehillot series, and the sections on Hungarian Jewry in Salo Baron's Social and Religious History of the Jews. Despite these contributions and a handful of other works, however, the literature on Hungarian Jewry in non-Hungarian languages remains pitifully small, particularly in English. An interested reader can choose one of a number of comprehensive English-language surveys of German or Polish Jewish history, but until now has had to consult half a dozen books in two or three languages to find an equally comprehensive history of Hungarian Jewry. This historiographical lacuna, so aptly noted by Bergl and Patai, resulted not only from a dearth of the rabbinic literature that elsewhere provided an indispensable cornerstone in the documentary foundation of medieval Jewish historical writing, but also from the shortage of secondary sources accessible to those who could not read Hungarian. Even Baron, in his seminal article on 1. Joseph Bergl, Geschichte der Ungarische Juden (Leipzig, 1879), p. 3.</page><page sequence="6">312 BOOK REVIEWS the Revolutions of 1848, admitted a certain reluctance to include Hungarian Jewry due to a lack of sources.2 Source material and language difficulties, however, are impediments that most graduate students face at some point. Hardly unique to this one area of study, such problems do not fully explain why Hungarian Jewry has received so little scholarly attention. A broader view of this scholarly lacuna shows that it reflects a historiographical tendency to place German and Polish Jewry squarely at the center of the history of the Ashkenazic experience, while relegating neighboring Jewish communities-in Hungary, the Netherlands, and Romania, for example--to the periphery. Patai has taken an important step toward retrieving Hungarian Jewry, the third-largest Jewry in the world in 1914, from the margins of the Ashkenazic Jewish experience. His single greatest contribution in this volume is to make the thousand-year history of Jews in Hungary accessible to non-Hungarian readers, an accomplishment he enhances by announcing at the outset the limitations of this project. No single volume, after all, could contain a thousand years of history, and the author's refreshing candor allows his readers to keep their expectations reasonable. Patai arranged the book, for the most part, chronologically. He leads his readers quickly though the first seven centuries of Jewish life in Hungary, from the beginnings of Jewish settlement before the Magyar conquest through the ebb and flow of the Middle Ages. Little about these centuries was unusual, as the history of Jews in Hungary followed the general contours of Jewish history elsewhere on the continent: the Crusades, the expulsions, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the wars of religion, and the Age of Absolutism. Whatever distinguishing features there might have been, Patai duly notes, are largely lost to us because the documentary evidence is limited to charters and legal statutes. For example, the royal charter that King Louis I granted Hungarian Jews in 1301, which readers can enjoy for the first time in translation from the Latin original, lists an array of restrictions and privileges similar to those that Jews received from other Christian sovereigns. Similarly, in recounting the attitude of the Renaissance monarch Mathias Corvinus toward his Jewish subjects, and the momentary surge of Jewish cultural activity during his reign, Patai captures the hybrid attitude of a Renaissance Christian monarch seeking a middle ground between his intellectual and cultural appetites and the 2. Salo Baron, "The Revolutions of 1848: Jewish Scholarship," Proceedings ofthe American Academy of Jewish Research 21 (1952): 87.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 313 practical demands of administering Jews in a hostile Christian environment. Occasionally, Patai enhances this chronological survey by incorporating his other research interests, such as his work on medieval Jewish alchemy, into his account of the Middle Ages. These asides neither add to nor detract from the overall sweep of the survey. On the whole, though, this book deals primarily with the last two centuries. Patai aptly apportioned the book according to the size and prominence of Hungarian Jewry. Hungary emerged as a major center of world Jewry during the nineteenth century, and Patai appropriately devotes three-quarters of the book to the last 150 years, and more than half to the post-1867 period. Here he recapitulates some of the broader strokes of earlier historians-the disproportionate role of Hungarian Jews in the economic development of the kingdom, the protracted debate over Jewish emancipation, and the division of Hungarian Jewry into Orthodox and Neolog factions-but then reiterates some of their omissions as well. Patai, like Hungarian Jewish historians in general, passes quickly over the decades between 1790 and 1848, and devotes a mere five pages to the Revolutions of 1848. By the time he finishes discussing the Emancipation Edict of 1868 and the schism between Orthodoxy and Neology, it is clear that Patai is patiently plodding his way toward the central theme of the survey: the inherent compatibility between Jews and Magyars alluded to in his earlier chapters. A common thread that runs throughout the book recounts the naturally amiable relationship between Jews and Magyars which is periodi- cally interrupted by foreign influences, such as the Roman Catholic Church, Jesuits, German Burghers, the growing influence of the Habsburgs, German racial antisemitism, and finally Nazis and Communists. This preoccupation with demonstrating a natural rapprochement between Jews and Magyars presents Patai with a dilemma as he turns in successive chapters to the role of Hungarian Jews in the founding of Zionism and the contributions of assimilated Hungarian Jews tofin de siecle culture and science. Drawing on his recent study of Theodor Herzl, Patai scrutinizes the paradoxical role of Hungarian Jews in the rise of Zionism. Hungarian Jewry, he argues, produced not only Herzl, Max Nordau, and numerous other precursors and founders of Zionism, but also the major opponents of the movements. For a brief moment in chapter 30, Patai seems prepared to probe the role of assimilated Hungarian Jews in the rise of Zionism. Was Herzl, he ponders, simply a case of leadership from the periphery, a man reacting to antisemitism, or did some uniquely Hungarian circumstance</page><page sequence="8">314 BOOK REVIEWS lead him back to Jewishness? Instead of answering this question, Patai abandons it in favor of a more conventional and less provocative litany of assimilated Jews whose contributions to Hungarian culture and science he simply cannot overlook. Equally disappointing is his explanation of Gy6z6 Ist6czy and other Hungarian racial antisemites as the product of foreign influence: The rise of Hungarian anti-Semitism in the 1870s was undoubtedly influenced by developments in Germany, where Adolf St6cker, preacher of the Prussian court, in 1878 founded the Christian Social Workers Party with an anti-Semitic program. In Hungary, the German example, added to the indigenous rise of anti-Jewish sentiment among the impc e-.-rished smallholders, facilitated the spread of the movement whose main proponent was Gy6z6 Ist6czy. (p. 347) Patai continues his survey into the twentieth century, and by now the reader appreciates the author's ability to describe a highly complex series of events: the 1919 Communist revolution and the ensuing counter-revolution, the numerus clausus and other anti-Jewish laws. Again, Patai links the rise in Hungarian antisemitism to developments in Germany, in this case the rise of Nazism. Hitler, he argues, strengthened the Hungarian right by providing antisemitic politicians like Gyula G6mbOs, who negotiated an economic agreement with Nazi Germany, with easy and impressive successes in foreign policy. No survey of Hungarian Jewry would be complete without a few remarks on the destruction of Hungarian Jewry and its aftermath, and Patai does not disappoint his readers. Why, he asks, did such a comparatively large number of Hungarian Jews remain in Hungary after the war, and what sort of Jewish identity did they maintain? Here, portraying post-Holocaust Hungarian Jews as twentieth-century Marranos whose self-imposed religious and cultural silence was intensified by a half-century of communist rule, Patai makes it evident why psychology is an element in the book's subtitle. In the end, the numerous shortcomings of The Jews of Hungary--the absence of footnotes and a comprehensive bibliography, the scant attention to geographical variation-do not detract from the author's accomplishment. By condensing the tortuous history of Hungarian Jewry into a single volume, Raphael Patai has not only provided future researchers with an invaluable reference work, but also made it significantly easier for English readers to approach this once-elusive topic. An obvious first step will be annotating the</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 315 volume. Patai recognized the limitations of the book, as he candidly admitted in his prefatory remarks, but he also expressed what he hoped its potential impact would be on future scholarship. However, mine is but a first attempt, and not without shortcomings of its own. I was over eighty when I began working on this book. At that age, one no longer has the patience-or the time-to follow up meticulously every lead, or to undertake all the myriad minor tasks that could go into writing such a major historical study. I am sure that in the coming years young historians will take up the subject and will produce better and more complete histories of Hungarian Jewry. I shall not be here to see them, but I want to welcome them in advance. (p. 2) Howard Lupovitch Colby College Waterville, Me.</page></plain_text>
