<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael E. Staub. Torn at the Roots. The Crisis of Jewish Liberalism in Postwar America. New York: Columbia University Press, 2002. 386 pp. This is a uniquely informed and informative work on the vicissitudes of the radical Jewish left in America, post-1945, and the losing battle it has waged against more conservative impulses within American Jewry. It is also notably uninforma- tive about the liberalism of American Jews that ostensibly forms the focal point of its discussion. It ably documents a variety of topics: the persistent intra-Jewish strife over political dissent, the overfree use by both sides of Holocaust rhetoric, the penchant for Jewish political discourse to indulge in citing so-called "prophet- ic" and "Talmudic" models to legitimize or delegitimize controversial contempo- rary positions, and the recent demise of an organized, active Jewish left wing. In contrast, the author displays little interest, if any, in survey data on Jewish opin- ion, and he is similarly unconcerned with comparing Jews and other ethnic or re- ligious groups or otherwise contextualizing the phenomena he discusses in gener- al American political terms. The result is a book that possesses many merits save one: it is not a well-rounded or convincing treatment of postwar American Jewish liberalism. At the heart of Staub's book lie conceptual and definitional issues that are never resolved. Before taking up his narrative about the decade of the fifties, Staub 203</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews opens with a "flash-forward" to the 1968 dismissal of Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman, the Jewish campus chaplain at Columbia University, against the background of the rabbi's support for student strike activity on the campus that year-a notably vir- ulent and, indeed, violent season of strife at Columbia that left many scars. Staub closes his book with a description of the witch hunt conducted against Breira, a dissident, left-wing Jewish group of the early 1970s (which my own membership in once lost me a job opportunity in Jewish education). Neither the Goldman case nor Breira fits neatly within most accepted schemes of what constitutes "liberal- ism." It is far more accurate to describe both as episodes belonging to the margins of the Jewish left experience in America. In framing his discussion between these points of reference, Staub underlines the ambiguous-even idiosyncratic-nature of his political definitions and the resulting lack of clarity about the purposes of his book. In between these two orienting episodes, Staub guides the reader through a broad-ranging discussion on the engagement of organizations and public person- ages in the Jewish community with African-American affairs since the fifties, with the politics of the Cold War (especially with regard to the Rosenbergs and the Paul Robeson controversy), with the Vietnam War, the Israeli-Arab wars of 1967 and 1973, the sexual revolution, the New Left, feminism, the debates over abortion rights, and gay rights. He demonstrates that the Jewish community never formed a consensus on any of these, but his treatment of these issues and the sources he uses to support his argument invariably pit the community's most radical elements against what he calls "antiliberal" critics. Where, one wonders, are all the liberals, and why are some of his "antiliberal" examples not very convincing in that role (Arthur Hertzberg, of all people, figures prominently in this regard).1 One reads with interest Staub's account of the involvements of the American Jewish Congress and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in the poli- tics of racial integration in the sixties-this, at least, really is a case of liberal Jews addressing liberal issues. But what is one to make of a book on Jewish liberalism that omits mention of Alex Rose and the Liberal Party; David Dubinsky and the Jewish unions; Senator Jacob Javits; the longstanding political alliances between Jews and such leading American liberals as Hubert Humphrey; figures like Bella Abzug; the quest by Jewish organizations to shore up the so-called "wall of sepa- ration" between church and state; the always shifting (but, compared to other groups, remarkably stable) Jewish voting records over the past fifty years; the Jew- ish role in the American Civil Liberties Union (which merits only two very oblique, one-line references)? How is one to understand a perception of disarray in the Jew- ish liberal-left camp that does not entail even a sideways glance at the ideological disarray in the Democratic Party, its splintered leadership and its studied avoid- ance of the nasty "L" word since the Clinton administration? 1. Hertzberg's famous book, The Zionist Idea, is misidentified by Staub as the Zionist Ideal (p. 93), which may simply be a technical error. In a somewhat related and more substantive reference that is worth correcting, however, Staub identifies the late Abraham Joshua Heschel, along with Arthur Hertzberg, as a Conservative rabbi (p. 12). Heschel was not a Conservative rabbi, though he was a very prominent theologian at the Jewish Theological Seminary. 204</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews What one must make of such a book, clearly, is that it takes all of the above for granted-though many readers might well have profited from some basic ori- entation in the field-and proceeds instead to examine the cultural politics of Jew- ish communal infighting. This is a legitimate subject in its own right, of course. Though it sets out to be a study of postwar American Jewish liberalism, Staub has, in fact, written a finely detailed account of the politicization of Jewish ethnicity and religion in the post-Holocaust period. What interests Staub most of all are the political constructions that Jews over the past decades have placed upon their Jew- ishness and upon Judaism. This is what leads him, as well, in a last-minute gam- bit (on the book's final page) to lament the recent inward-turning tendency of Jews of different political hues, which he contends not only robs the debate between left and right of the fire and passion of yore, but also portends a loss of social cohe- sion among Jews. No longer quite so avid for a good old-fashioned fight over the "Jewish" roots and Judaic rightness of their politics, the author warns "that col- lectivity known as a Jewish people" is coming "closer to an end" (p. 308). The real crux of the book, then, appears not to be the "crisis of Jewish liberalism," but the crisis of Jewish ethnicity. It is disconcerting, in the first place, that Staub has not discussed, apart from a telegraphic sentence or two, what transpired between the mid-seventies and the end of the twentieth century to bring about the situation as he sees it. It also seems, from my vantage point here in Israel, where we have had a prime minister assassi- nated for political reasons, disturbingly insular for Staub to suggest that the sort of political polarization that he has so amply described could be, of all things, the surest sign of a healthy collective life.
