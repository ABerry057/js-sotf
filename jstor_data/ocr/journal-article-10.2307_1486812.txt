<plain_text><page sequence="1">Norman A. Stillman. The Jews of Arab Lands in Modern Times. Philadel- phia: Jewish Publication Society, 1991. xxviii, 604 pp. Among the historiographic debates that seem to continue endlessly and determine the way in which scholars slant their writing of history, an impor- tant one concerns the history of the Jews of the Islamic world. This is the debate between those upholding what the late Salo W. Baron called the "lachrymose conception of Jewish history" (applied by him more broadly than to the Arab or Islamic experience, of course) and those stressing the "golden age" that is said to have typified Islamic-Jewish relations. The issue has been raised afresh in an exchange published in Tikkun (May-June 1991) between Mark R. Cohen of Princeton University and Norman A. Stillman of SUNY-Binghamton. The former further refines the above terms to "neo- lachrymose" and "interfaith utopia," respectively, and rejects both approaches, trying to show what religious, social, and economic reasons lay behind the better situation of Jews in Muslim lands as compared with the Christian world. In his response, titled "Myth, Counter-Myth, and Distortion," Stillman argued that the current use of these approaches is largely limited to non- scholars and lobbying groups. Where Cohen states that the hard-line atti- tudes of ("neo-lachrymose") Sephardic Jews in Israel toward the Pales- tinian question are not rooted "in accurate historical memory," Stillman counters with an overview of fourteen hundred years of Jewish history in the Arab world which lie behind what he calls the memoire collective of the Oriental Jews, the motivation for their anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian poli- tics. Where Cohen cites the use by a Sephardi activist of the "golden age myth," Stillman sees it as "an apologetic response to both real and imag- ined discrimination by Ashkenazim in Israel." Thus, in a very striking man-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 ner, the ideological underpinnings of the historiography of the Jews of the Arab world, the myths and counter-myths, reflect contemporary political realities in the Arab-Israel conflict as well as internal Israeli and Diaspora Jewish political outlooks. In the volume under review, Stillman brings his survey of Jewish life in the Arab world up to roughly the present. Twelve years ago, his previous volume, The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book, provided us with a rich body of newly translated or republished material from the time of Muhammad and the earliest days of Islam to the nineteenth century. The new volume begins with that century, and presents in some detail the many changes through which the traditional Jewish communities of the Arab world passed in ever more rapid tempo. The lengthy introductory chapters in both volumes are excellent outline presentations of the history and the major historiographic issues involved, presenting in rather full summary the results of the ever-growing body of research on the Jews of the Arab world. Almost every possible -ism and -ation passed over the Jews, Christians, and, to a lesser extent, Muslims of the area. Thoroughly describing the pro- cesses of colonization, Europeanization, westernization, modernization, gal- licization (in North Africa, except for Libya, and in the Levant), seculariza- tion, alienation, and more, Stillman shows us how these culminated in Arab and Islamic nationalist movements, on the one side, and assimilation (pri- marily to European culture) and Zionism, on the other. In tracing some of these new ideologies, we see the bitter struggles that broke out within the Jewish community: between tradition and rapid change, between the rabbis (lacking any movement of religious reform) and the secularists, between the gallicizing Alliance Israel1ite and the hebraizing Zionists, between political and economic conservatives and radical socialists and communists. While doing so, Stillman performs the very important function of explaining in very convincing form the steps that led to the recent Jewish migration en masse from areas they had inhabited for more than two thousand years, in some instances, long before those lands were Arabized and Islamized. Some of the processes referred to above, such as colonization, westerni- zation, and modernization, were welcomed by members of the religious and ethnic minorities-Jews, Christians, Greeks, Armenians, etc.-as means of improving their condition in the lands of their origin as well as offering them new opportunities in Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere outside the world of Islam. But they also gave rise to contrary phenomena within the Arab</page><page sequence="3">134 BOOK REVIEWS world that made continued coexistence difficult and even impossible. The rise of militant Arab nationalism, often tied to Islam; of fascist sympathies during the 1930s and 1940s; of the European-style antisemitism that co- alesced with indigenous anti-Jewish sentiments; and the growth of militant Islamic movements, all mark the last century and a half. All of this serves as a necessary antidote to the mythology using the "golden age" or "interfaith utopia" side of the debate, which holds that the end of that "utopia" was due solely to the rise of Zionism and the eventual creation of the state of Israel. As valuable as the introduction are the collected, often translated, texts of letters, diaries, travel impressions, official documents, and the like, that make up the bulk of the volume. Together, the two volumes provide fasci- nating reading for nonspecialist and specialist alike, and should serve as use- ful sources for learning and teaching about the often-forgotten Jewish com- munities of the Middle East and North Africa. There is, however, a problem that goes back to the debate with which we began. At the risk of being accused of reviewing a book the author did not write, and of expatiating on what should have been written, I must mention an issue faced in using the first volume as a text in a course I taught last year, and still true about the second volume. After reading several assigned sections of the book, students complained that they got no idea of any positive contributions to Jewish culture by the Jews of Arab lands and no picture of their everyday lives. The constant citation of texts dealing with persecutions and legal disabilities, without picturing positive aspects of communal life, raised the question for these students of why Jews remained to suffer further. Similarly, they asked, why had some Jews fled European persecution to find refuge or economic opportunity in Islamic lands? The greatest lack, not fully rectified in the second volume, is a picture of the cultural creativity and inner community life-aside from occasional controversies-of these ancient and great Jewish communities, which over four brief decades have almost totally disap- peared. This one caveat aside, Stillman has performed a remarkable and extremely valuable task both in collecting the various documents he makes available, many for the first time, and for his very insightful analysis of the causes underlying the tragic end of Jewish life in the Arab world.
