<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amnon Linder, ed. and trans. The Jews in the Legal Sources of the Early Middle Ages. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. 717 pp. Amnon Linder, professor of medieval history in Jerusalem's Hebrew University, was the editor of The Jews in Roman Imperial Legislation (1987). The volume under review is a sequel that brings this important project to the late twelfth century in regard to some text genres. Although many of the texts are already available in English translation, Linder has done an immense service to those who teach courses on the history of the Jews in the medieval West and in the Byzantine Empire by bringing the material together in a single volume, executing translations of items that had not previously been available, including the original Greek and Latin texts for those who might use them in advanced courses, and providing a useful if brief introduction to each selection. Thus, the observations below should be seen not as diminishing the value of Linder's contribution but merely as suggestions for the improvement of what likely will be a needed second edition of a work that is sure to become an essential teaching text. Specialists in Western European early medieval history generally begin their studies during the last century of the Roman Empire and end with the dissolution of the Carolingian Empire in the later ninth and early tenth centuries. This is particularly relevant to the study of law because during</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 139 the period adumbrated above, personality of the law dominated. The post- Carolingian era saw the development of territoriality of the law. Linder's periodization is unhelpful because Jews continued to be regarded as Romani, i.e. they lived under the lex Romanorum in the early medieval Romano- Germanic successor states of the empire. We know these as the regna of groups such as the Burgundians, Visigoths, and Lombards, and their laws are known as the Lex Burgundionum, the Lex Visigothorum, and the Lex Langobardorum. However, as Romani the Jews continued to enjoy the special privilege, given them by the empire, of living under the Lex Judeorum in regard to matters that concerned Jews alone. Because of the persistence of personality of the law throughout the early Middle Ages, there was a need for legislation that would make it possible to effect legal interactions between parties who lived under different leges. For example, there was legislation that enabled a Saxon to deal with a Frank or a Goth to deal with a Roman. In regard to those who lived under the Lex Judeorum, scholars traditionally have come to call this legislation "Jewry law." Unfortunately, Linder leaves his readers ignorant of this rather complicated early medieval situation. Moreover, he does not seem to realize that the counties and duchies that emerged during the post-Carolingian era were, for all intents and purposes, autonomous states in which local territorial law was very rapidly developed and displaced personality of the law. Linder misleadingly labels this locally based territorial law as "customary law" and mistakenly observes that it is "characterized by oral transmission and procedure" (p. 14). Rather, tens of thousands of surviving tenth- and eleventh- century juridical acta testify, for example, to a vast corpus of property law and to well-established legal procedures that indicate both development and the syncretism of the various above-mentioned leges. The great importance of these changes for Jews is obvious. They succeeded in maintaining their personal law in the new conditions and thus highlighted their alien identity; i.e., they were no longer merely one of the gentile peoples. A strict construction of Jewry law should be limited to laws that dictate how a Jew must behave in specific contexts. Thus, most of the legislation by early medieval church bodies is not proper Jewry law because it dictates the behavior of Christians, not of Jews. See, for example, the penance that reads, "If any Christian woman should ... willingly fornicate [mistranslated as "commit adultery"] with them [Jews], she shall be separated from the Church for a whole year" (p. 602). This is not Jewry law, although it may indicate something about a local behavior that is under attack by church</page><page sequence="3">140 BOOK REVIEWS authorities. In a similar vein, Linder includes numerous texts such as Charles the Bald's letter (p. 367), which indicates that the king is using a messenger on royal business who is a Jew. Without commentary this letter has no juridical significance regarding Jews. Although many texts that are not proper Jewry law or even legal in nature have been included in this volume, a great deal that is of relevance has been omitted. In the early medieval West, most texts were written on papyrus into the later eighth century, and this is a very fragile medium in the northern European climate. However, many lost juridical acta, technically called perdita, are discussed in later surviving documents and some are even quoted; this provides us with fragmenta. For example, Charlemagne issued numerous capitularies that have not survived, but his previous acta are frequently mentioned in later texts. These perdita andfragmenta deserve some treatment in the volume under review. There are also perdita of Jewry law to be identified in Hebrew and Arabic responsa. Since AJS Review is not a journal devoted to the technical aspects of medieval history, it would not be appropriate to compile a list of lacunae, dubious translations, and interpretations, which I am sure will be covered in more specialized publications. However, my article "Was Rumex a Tinctura Judeorum?"' will help the reader makes sense of the capitulum "Mitte rumice," attributed to Charlemagne, for which Linder's translation is not comprehensible.
