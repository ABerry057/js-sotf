<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yehudah Bauer. American Jewry and the Holocaust: The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, 1939-1945. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1980. 522 pp. The title of this carefully researched and, for the most part, compellingly written narrative is very misleading. The author tours virtually every corner of Nazi-occupied Europe (and Shanghai) with an incredible geographical familiarity, the kind most authors bring to one area (Angel to Rumania, Braham to Hungary, Poliakov to France, Presser to Holland, Ringelblum to Warsaw, Teich to Transnistria), or a reader to his or her own neighborhood. But Bauer tells us little about American Jews and even less about American Jewry; only one of the "heroes of the Holocaust" he portrays so skillfully is an American (Joseph Schwartz, the JDC European chief), and he spent the war years in Europe (Lisbon), not America. Bauer himself admits this: "The present volume ... deals only cursorily with the American background of JDC and concentrates on its activities abroad" (p. 13). And the picture of the "American background" is the weakest part of this book. The portrait of American Jewry has several weaknesses, most minor, one more serious. The exaggerated importance of the Emergency Committee of the Irgun in the creation of the War Refugee Board; the overlooking of the pressure put on the Roosevelt Administration late in 1942 and, increasingly, early in 1943 by American Jewry; the failure to delineate, in any sense com-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 251 parable to the portraits of the European "heroes," the American leadership of the Joint; and the lack of interest in the United Jewish Appeal, the organi- zation which raised virtually all of the money available to the JDC during the war-these are perhaps minor irritations. More importantly, albeit without any documentation, Bauer attributes the response (or lack of it) of American Jewry during the Holocaust to "virulent American antisemitism" (p. 39). According to Bauer, "anti- semitism was rampant" (p. 28) in America in the late thirties, and this led Jews, insecure about their position in America in 1940, 1941, and 1942, to hesitate to spend too much on overseas causes. Interesting-but without evidence. There is no doubt that American Jewry was insecure, and even divided, and that the war only increased these problems. And American Jewish historians agree that even when compared to the brutality which fills practically every page of Bauer's work-the Arrow Cross militia dumping 600 Budapest Jews it murdered into the Danube in October 1944, or the Rumanian soldiers who, at Iasi in late June 1941, shot, beat, choked, and clubbed to death 8,000 Jews and suffocated 2,645 more in two trains sealed shut with Jews but no food or water-American anti-Semitism did exist. Yet, the fact is that Bauer does not even look at the nuts and bolts of fund- raising for JDC in these years-at even one American Jewish community- and there is little direct evidence that, when the JDC or the UJA solicited funds in 1940 or 1942, anti-Semitism-even if we acknowledge its existence in any measurably significant fashion-played a role. The State Depart- ment's claim (even though its anti-Semitism was blatant) that little could be done was undoubtedly felt also by American Jews, who were surely not alone in not knowing how to do the little that could be done, in not grasping the full impact of what was occurring to Europe's Jews, and in probably being able to do little more than they did even if they had accurately grasped what was really happening. Bauer plays down these realities. In fact, the amounts JDC raised were quite sizable even during the years when "antisemitic sentiments were spreading" (p. 51). The 1938 campaign yielded almost $1,500,000 more than the year before, the 1939 joint United Palestine Appeal-JDC campaign raised double what the separate cam- paigns had raised one year earlier, and the campaigns of the early 1940s too did impressively, until between 1943 and 1944 JDC's income rose by 50 per- cent. Most American Jews solicited by the overseas fund-raising organiza- tions during the Holocaust hardly were affected by anti-Semitism. While weak on America, Bauer is impressive on Europe. This volume should be called European Jewry and the Holocaust, for the funds raised by</page><page sequence="3">252 BOOK REVIEWS the JDC in America were distributed through European lay and profession- al leaders of the JDC, or people and organizations supported by the Joint, men and women who became leaders of suffering Jewish communities and often rose to heights of heroism while aiding (mostly) and rescuing (some- times) a beleaguered Jewry. Bauer's narration, in the early chapters especially, is as gripping as that of his rather similar book, From Diplomacy to Resistance, and both demon- strate his remarkable word-painting talents. The drama of clandestine operations, especially rescue efforts, in various places, of trying to merely keep Polish Jewry alive, of dealing with the Japanese in Shanghai, and- most engaging of all-the JDC negotiations (which Bauer believes the Nazis took very seriously) for Jewish lives in exchange for trucks and money, especially when the Joint had nothing to bargain with, not only introduce us to unforgettable personalities but demonstrate, despite all that was not done, the immensity of the Jewish response to the Nazi terror. Some of Bauer's emphases in the heart of the book will arouse discus- sion. Following Lucy Dawidowicz, Bauer argues that the extermination of the Jews was the centerpiece of Nazi cosmology; most European historians, I believe, would hesitate to assign killing the Jews the role in Nazi ideology which Bauer gives it, or, as Bauer does, to see anti-Semitism as a central cause of World War Ii and to explain the German invasion of Russia by Hitler's "explicit ... desire to destroy the Jewish enemy lurking behind the Soviet regime" (p. 454). He takes very seriously, as I myself do, the notion of mass resettlement offered by the Nazis, and though Dawidowicz dismisses it, Bauer's case is most convincing. And Bauer's constant need to mete out praise or blame, to individuals and organizations (Palestinians, especially Zionist youth movements, get A's; the Allies, for their continual suppression of crucial facts concerning the Holocaust, D's; the JDC's insistence on "legality" C's; but the JDC, as a whole, a high mark), is unusual among historians, though more common among Jewish historians and very com- mon among Holocaust historians. I found his subjective judgments (pp. 52, 104, 216, 234, 322), even when I disagreed (did American Jewry do enough to save European Jewry?), provocative, and surely they reveal a historian deeply committed to ensuring that the Holocaust not be trivialized. And this he never does. Marc Lee Raphael Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio</page></plain_text>
