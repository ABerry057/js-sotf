Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 2000. xv, 239 pp. The Battles of Armageddon is a meticulous chronicle of the dozens of mil- itary clashes over the centuries that have given an aura of apocalyptic expectation to a small patch of valley in northern Israel. Television-evangelists and Bible- thumpers all over the world continue to whip up their followers with nightmarish visions of nuclear disaster and divine judgment linked to the ominous word "Ar- mageddon." But for those who care to dig a little deeper, Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University masterfully shows us that a long, violent, and tan- gled history lies behind that name. Cline systematically reveals the millennium- long steps by which certain arbitrary topographic realities, unchanging military technologies, and the relative geographical positions of the great Near Eastern em- pires made the site of Megiddo-and indeed all of the Jezreel Valley-a tragically tiresome cockpit of war. Beginning with a solid introduction about the world's fascination with the mystique of Megiddo-Armageddon and about the historical background behind it, Cline presents a series of chronologically arranged chapters, each highlighting a particular battle of Megiddo, the political background, the clashing cultures- and of course the eerie replay of the same movements, the same mistakes, and the same outcomes again and again. It is not simply that the military leaders through the ages have failed to learn from the past; Pharaohs, Canaanite princes, Israelite warriors, biblical kings, invading Roman armies, rival Muslim dynasties, modern Palestinians and Israelis, and global strategists looking into the cloudy future have learned all too perfectly that Megiddo could not be avoided if one was to gain mil- itary control of whatever you wish to call it: Canaan, Israel, Palestine, Southern Syria, the Levant. In this book, Cline's research on all periods in which there is any shred of recorded or archaeologically-inferred combat at Megiddo is painstaking and im- pressive. While many historians of the military history of Israel/Palestine tend to concentrate on either the ancient or modern periods, Cline offers a historical nar- rative with no bumpy transitions or selective omissions. In the vast span of time covered by the book, he naturally analyzes the most famous of the Biblical and classical battles, the campaigns of the Crusaders, and the modern wars of the State of Israel. Yet because he also includes some encounters that all but the most spe- cialized scholars would never have heard of, his descriptions of the medieval bat- tles for Megiddo between rival dynasties are especially enlightening. The book's style and attitude is thoroughly positivist. Except for the overar- ching intention to de-mystify Armageddon, readers will find little evidence of de- constructionism here. Nor will they find evidence of recent critical biblical schol- arship. In his chapter on the wars of Deborah and Barak described in the Book of Judges, for example, Cline takes the narrative quite literally as a fairly reliable mil- itary report. Whether it was, or for that matter whether the boasting triumphal in- scriptions of the various expansionist pharaohs can similarly be taken as reliable without a large grain of Dead Sea salt, is also a question. But at the same time, 114</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Cline does not completely ignore these thorny historiographical problems in con- structing his larger narrative. Cline provides a concluding look at the term "Armageddon" and its rela- tionship to the long, bloody history he recounts. Where other historians might have been content in simply bringing the story up to the present, Cline offers the read- er some thought-provoking reflections on the development of "Arnageddon" as a concept and what its continual use suggests about the social and religious preoc- cupations of the West. Yet Cline wisely does not seek to make a sweeping, sim- plistic judgment on how and why the battles of Armageddon happened. Such a re- ductionist conclusion would probably immediately arouse dissenters and would probably not be fully satisfying in any case. That's why Cline's concluding sum- mary offers a well-advised ending to a wide-ranging, yet ominously repetitive book: to quote the words of Santayana about the tragic futility of not remember- ing history. The Battles of Armageddon is a significant and welcome contribution to the military history of Israel. It seeks to resolve a number of specific, long-debated issues relating to Megiddo's military history. Its historical coverage is impressive- ly wide and its text is accompanied by clear and effective maps of the most im- portant battles from the Bronze Age to the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This book will undoubtedly make an important addition to the libraries of those scholars, institu- tions, and interested lay-people involved in the study of both the ancient and mod- ern Near East.
