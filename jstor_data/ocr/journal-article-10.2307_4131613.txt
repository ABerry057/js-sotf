<plain_text><page sequence="1">Menahem Kahana. Sifre Zuta Deuteronomy. Citations from a New Tannaitic Midrash. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2002. 476 pp. (Hebrew) In 1989, after the fall of the Iron Curtain in the former Soviet Union, Mena- hem Kahana of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem was the first Israeli scholar to search the St. Petersburg and Moscow libraries for manuscripts of rabbinic texts, and especially for lost halakhic midrashim. During his second visit, Kahana no- ticed that in a commentary on Deuteronomy written by a tenth-century Karaite sage named Yeshua ben Yehuda from Jerusalem, there were derashot to Deuteron- omy that are unknown from any other rabbinic source. At first, he tentatively as- sumed that these quotations were from lost sections of the Mekhilta on Deuteronomy. However, the more Kahana culled quotations from the 30 (!) man- uscripts ofYeshua's commentary, the more he realized that the terminological dif- ferences between these derashot and Mekhilta on Deuteronomy, coupled with the absence of these sources from Midrash Hagadol, which was familiar with Mekhil- ta on Deuteronomy, precluded such identification. In 1993, Kahana lectured on these derashot and identified them as belonging to a third tannaitic midrash on Deuteronomy (Sifre on Deuteronomy being the first), which he entitled Sifre Zuta Deuteronomy (SZD) based on its similarities to the already known Sifre Zuta Num- bers (SZN). Kahana completely rejects the possibility that these derashot are fakes or paraphrases. This denial is based on several proofs. First, Yeshua's quotations of numerous other known rabbinic sources are accurate. Second, the quotations from 319</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews SZD contain midrashic terminology unknown from any other source except SZN, with which Yeshua was not familiar. These, along with other rare phrases, unusu- al usage of rabbinic Hebrew, and uncommon Greek words, make it impossible that Yeshua invented these sources. Finally, some of these derashot are found in two other medieval sources: Sefer Pitron Torah published by E. E. Urbach and Midrash Hadash on the Torah, published by Jacob Mann. These independent corroborations of Yeshua's quotations proves that they were not his invention. Kahana's edition of SZD is divided into two sections: (1) an introduction and (2) a critical edition and commentary. The first section of the introduction deals with the three sources in which Kahana has identified derashot taken from SZD. In the chapter on the aforementioned Yeshua ben Yehudah, Kahana concentrates on a technical description of Yeshua's commentary on Deuteronomy and his method in quoting from SZD. Sefer Pitron Torah, the second source in which Ka- hana found quotations from SZD, was published by E. E. Urbach in 1978. Ac- cording to Urbach, this collection of midrashim and biblical commentary was composed in Babylonia in the late ninth or early tenth century. Midrash Hadash on the Torah, the third source for SZD, was partially published by Jacob Mann in 1940 in his book, The Bible as Read and Preached in the Old Synagogue. The re- mainder of the work was published in 1966 by Hebrew Union College. Whereas the work's compiler and exact place of origin remain unknown, based on the com- piler's familiarity with the Palestinian triennial cycle of Torah readings Mann pro- posed that its origins were in Jewish centers in the east. The second section of the introduction examines the connection between SZD and SZN. The close connection between these two works is based on three factors: (1) the shared terminology, (2) the individual derashot common to both works and not common to other tannaitic sources, and (3) the named sages in these two works, compared with the named sages in other tannaitic sources. In this sec- tion and the following it becomes clear that Kahana's research into the halakhic midrashim is based on their classification into two corpora, "of the School of R. Ishmael" (Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael; portions of the Sifra; Sifre on Numbers; and Mekhilta on Deuteronomy) and "of the School of R. Akiva" (Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon ben-Yochai; most of the Sifra; SZN; Sifre on Deuteronomy; and SZD). This classification was originally proposed by David Zvi Hoffman and further devel- oped by subsequent scholars, first and foremost J. N. Epstein. Although some have recently criticized this classification, Kahana's arguments for its general correct- ness are so convincing as to make them practically unassailable. Kahana's argu- ments in favor of such classification are based on philological grounds and not on proposed theological/philosophical differences or on differences in methods of biblical interpretation. It is only once the philological differences have been well documented that these other differences between the two schools may be docu- mented. Kahana has argued for this classification for decades and we can hope that his summary discussion of the halakhic midrashim, due to appear in the second volume of Literature of the Sages (Fortress Press), will appear in print soon. Having established the connection between SZD and SZN, Kahana next de- scribes SZD itself. He discusses such issues as: the language of SZD, the relation- ship of SZD to the Mishnah, the place of the editing of SZD, and reflections of SZD 320</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews in later talmudic literature. At the end of this section he includes a brief summary on the different schools of the halakhic midrashim. Kahana's introduction to SZD is rich in technical discussions of the materi- al. The examples that Kahana provides are valuable not only for their detailed de- scription of SZD, but also for the insights they provide into the other halakhic midrashim in particular and into tannaitic literature in general. For example, Ka- hana provides a long list of passages that Horowitz included in his edition of SZN that, according to Kahana, are not part of SZN and come from other works. Until a new critical edition of SZN is produced, this list is an invaluable tool in its study. As a further example, Kahana describes the unique use of the term "bet hashekhi- nah" in SZD and SZN as referring to the Temple. Other rabbinic works use such terms as "bet hamikdash" and "bet habehirah." Kahana proposes that "bet hashekhinah" is an earlier term and that the later terms are meant to temper the de- scription of the Temple as a place of God's presence. The remainder of the book is a critical commentary on the 138 derashot that were part of the original, much larger midrash. In each section Kahana has in- cluded the introductory Arabic words which Yeshua used, followed by the derashah itself. In cases where there were more than one textual witness for the derashah, Kahana creates an eclectic text. Below the derashah appears a clear apparatus list- ing manuscript differences, and full, well-organized lists of parallels in rabbinic sources. Kahana comments on each derashah separately, explaining both the de- rashah itself, and, when applicable, the content of the derashah and its relation- ship to the parallels in other rabbinic sources. In these discussions one can find comments that will affect research into all of the different branches of the study of rabbinic literature, as well as important notes on other fields such as language and history. I will offer just two examples: SZD's midrash on Deut 24:1 (pp. 346-359) deals at length with two inter- related issues: (1) can a woman force her husband to divorce her by claiming that she is somehow forbidden to him; and (2) do certain types of immodest behavior obligate a husband to divorce his wife. The fact that this derashah is parallel to oth- er sources from the Mishnah and the Tosefta and yet differs in wording, context, and halakhah makes for rich comparisons that can yield interesting results in the study of the redaction of tannaitic halakhah. Kahana's discussion of the derashah is in essence a detailed article on the differing tannaitic views on divorce and the nature of marriage, as well as a brief comparison of these views to those ascribed to Jesus. (Kahana returns to this subject later in the book when discussing a de- rashah concerning relatives who are disqualified from testimony). Future discus- sions of early rabbinic attitudes towards divorce cannot afford to ignore this source. The second example is a derashah on Deut 16:18 which contains informa- tion on the function and appointment of courts of three and twenty-three. Accord- ing to Kahana, this derashah is the only talmudic source to assume that courts of three are appointed and not chosen by the litigants, as is stated in mSan 3:1. Fur- thermore, the derashah claims that one of the jobs of the judges is "to expound upon the Torah and the Writings (ketuvim)." Kahana raises the possibility that this is the earliest known reference to the later custom of public exposition of the Torah 321</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews on the Sabbath. If he is correct, this derashah may prove an invaluable source in the discussion of the early rabbinic legal system, its appointment of judges, and their function. The larger impact of the discovery of SZD on talmudic research must not be underestimated. The other recently rediscovered halakhic midrashim (Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon b. Yohai, SZN, and Mekhilta on Deuteronomy) were known, to a less- er or greater degree, by some medieval rabbis. In contrast, SZD seems to have been relatively unknown already to the amoraim, both in Palestine and Babylonia, and was almost completely unknown to medieval rabbis. Its discovery increases the possibility that other ancient rabbinic texts may be discovered in the future. Until now, an assumption could be made that for each book of the Pentateuch there ex- isted two halakhic midrashim, one from the Ishmaelian school and one from the Akivan school; the appearance of a third midrash on Deuteronomy proves that this assumption is wrong. Kahana is himself optimistic about the future discovery of other lost texts. The greater the possibility of future discoveries exists, the greater caution the talmudic researcher must exhibit in evaluating existing literature and especially in evaluating parallel sources. Is a derashah found in the Babylonian Talmud an editorial revision of one found in the Sifre on Deuteronomy, or might it be from a section of SZD that has not yet been located? Is a baraita which ap- pears in one of the Talmudim a revision of a parallel source in the Tosefta, or is it from a collection of baraitot or midrashim that did not survive? These questions are frequently asked by scholars; Kahana's work should have an impact on the an- swers. Kahana's book sets a high standard for critical editions of midrashim. In comparison, all other critical editions of halakhic midrashim pale, both in their crit- ical apparatus and in the depth of their commentary. The publication of SZD has created the strange situation whereby the midrash that was least known through- out history now exists in the best edition, whereas most of the Sifra, the longest of the halakhic midrashim, has not merited any critical edition. After several centuries of searching for lost midrashim, a search which has yielded impressive results, one hopes that we have not "lost" the main midrashim, and that scholars will increas- ingly turn their attention towards publishing and commenting on these monumen- tally important works.
