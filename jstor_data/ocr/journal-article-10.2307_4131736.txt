Subsequent historiography took little notice of the Schreiben, perhaps be- cause its author, and hence the context in which it was composed, remained uniden- tified. In this article, I show that the author of the Schreiben is the Berlin physician and early maskil Aaron Salomon Gumpertz, also known as Aaron Zalman Em- merich (1723-1769) and that his friend, the noted poet, playwright and critic Got- thold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781), was directly involved in its publication. This identification should give Gumpertz and his Schreiben the place they deserve in German history and in the history of the Jews in Germany; at the same time, it en- hances our appreciation of Lessing as a central figure in promoting the rights of Jews in Germany. I. THE SCHREIBEN: SOME BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA The Schreiben was first published in Berlin in 1753, "bey Christian Friedrich Voss." Contrary to what Toury and others believed, copies of this edition are ex- tant.6 In this original edition, the Schreiben consists of three parts: Pages 3-13 car- ry a purported epistle, entitled "Schreiben eines Juden an einen Philosophen," signed by "Levi Israel" on March 24, 1753, at M**; pages 14-24 carry the "re- ply," entitled "Antwort des Philosophen," signed by "R.C.D.N" on April 30, 1753 at A***; and pages 15-32 are an appendix entitled: "Anhang die in Engelland ver- stattete Naturalisirung der Juden betreffend." This edition of the Schreiben was reviewed on August 4, 1753, by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and, in 1755, anony- mously, in Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek.7 The pamphlet was reissued in of the "Reichsinstitut ftir Geschichte des neuen Deutschland" founded by Walter Frank (1905-1945) in 1935; see ibid., p.

This edition, of which apparently only a single copy survives today, is the work of an anonymous adversary of the improvement of the Jews' standing.8 It differs from the original edition in two respects: it adds a "Vorbericht" of fourteen pages in which the au- thor critically discusses the original Schreiben, and it accompanies the conscien- tiously reproduced text of the original Schreiben with critical notes that endeavor to refute its theses.9 It was this, the 1759 edition, which Jacob Toury used and from which he retrieved the text of the editio princeps, which he reproduced in his 1969 publication.' This overtly anti-Jewish edition will not interest us here as an his- toric object in its own right but only occasionally as the response of an early read- er of the original Schreiben.11 II. THE SCHREIBEN. CONTENTS The first part of the Schreiben is ostensibly a letter addressed by "Levi Israel" to an unnamed Christian "philosopher." Levi Israel begins by thanking the latter for having sent him a draft of his Politik, a composition he read with much pleasure (3).12 In this work, the philosopher developed the thesis that a country should in- crease its population, and that to this end the prince should encourage marriage, attend to the education of orphans, and attempt to acquire foreign colonies (4). Levi Israel sets out to propose to his correspondent yet another way to achieve the same goal. He realizes, he writes, that most Christians would regard his suggestion as ridiculous and that the proposal itself involves "many hurdles [Unbequemlichkeit- en]," but he is confident that the philosopher, his friend, would give him a fair hear- ing (4). Levi Israel introduces his subject with a sentence that indirectly presents him as a Jew and suggests that the Jews are at the center of his concern: "you know that the people of my nation cannot at all reside in Spain and Portugal" (4). He contin- ues by observing that in Germany, the Jews are not allowed to own land or real es- tate and are thus forced to earn their living through trade. If, however, they were given the permission to own land and houses, and to exercise professions other than trade, he continues, they would quickly become wealthier and, consequently, 8.

The text has: Entwurfder Politik; three words that can also be taken to be a title meaning: "A Scheme for Politics." For commodity I will henceforth use the name "Levi Israel" to refer to the al- leged author of this part of the Schreiben, although, as I will argue, there was no person by that name. Here and in what follows all page numbers given in brackets in the text refer to the first edition. 301</page><page sequence="4">Gad Freudenthal attract the immigration of "many thousands" of Jews from other countries. This would lead to an increase in the circulation of money and consequently to a rise of the prices of real estate, thereby raising the state's income from taxes (4-5). Levi Israel adds that he is confident that the philosopher, knowing him well, will not suspect him of writing only in the interest of his "brethren in faith" (Glaubens- genoJfen; 5). He is also confident that the philosopher would not raise any criti- cism of the Jewish religion: As a philosopher, he naturally perceives those who believe in a Messiah that has already come and those who believe in one who still is to come as equally congenial (6). Levi Israel next formulates and answers a series of possible objections to his suggestion.13 The Jews would inundate the entire country? Yes, but this is precisely the goal sought, namely to increase the country's wealth (6). The Jews would de- prive the Christians of their income? Yes, but by lowering prices they would ben- efit the population at large, and this benefit to the entire population would outweigh the prejudice eventually suffered by some individuals (7). The Jews are "not so orderly in their clothing and their houses" as the Christians? As a philoso- pher, his correspondent is certainly aware that these traits are not "essential" to them; rather, they are the "effects" of misery and despise, as is "demonstrated" by the fact that the serfs in Poland and Russia are much dirtier than the Jews, where- as the Portuguese Jews equal the Christians in tidiness. The Jews are unfit as sol- diers, and even if they were fit it would run against tradition to enlist them to the army? Levi Israel objects that nothing in the "constitution of the [Jews'] bodies nor in their [religious] Law" rules out their becoming soldiers, yet recognizes that the "habit" in Christian lands makes their drafting rather impractical. He observes, however, that with the income that the immigrating Jews will generate for the state, the regent will easily be in a position to hire foreign soldiers to replace the Jews (8). If Jews were freely allowed into the country, only the poor would come, and they are of little value for the state? No, the poor, too, of both religions, contribute to the general wealth and, moreover, not only poor Jews would settle in the coun- try (9-10). At this point in the letter, the purely matter-of-fact economic--mercan- tilist-discourse on the possible benefits the state would derive from a massive Jewish immigration gives way to a sociological discussion of the causes for the Jews' present deplorable circumstances and of the reasons they are hated. The philosopher could think, Levi Israel writes, that the foregoing arguments in favor of the Jews are canceled out by the "strong effect of the negative views [Vorstel- lungen]" concerning Jews that people have "everywhere." It is true, Levi Israel concedes, that the preaching of the theologians on the one hand, and the misery of most Jews on the other, induce in the Christians "very evil and almost inerasable notions" concerning the entire Jewish nation. This is why they usually oppose the idea that a ruler accord liberties to the Jews, or open his country to Jewish immi- 13. Below I offer a hypothesis as to the origin of this technique of writing. A reader of a draft of this paper raised the possibility that it reflects the method of "disputatio," which the author could have acquired at the university. This is unlikely to be the case, however: The doctoral dissertation of the author as I will identify him bears no mark of it. 302</page><page sequence="5">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) gration. To this argument Levi Israel objects in detail, pointing out that the hate is the result of the Jews' miserable state, which, however, can be changed by remov- ing the causes that have produced it. In the present "enlightened times" (erleuchtete Zeiten), he says, reflection should allow one to realize that the Jews were oppressed for hundreds of years by a combination of cruelty and religious zeal (10). It is this repression that has led to their decline: Jews get no training in the arts and the sciences nor receive phys- ical education; they cannot hold official posts; and are obliged to earn their living through commerce. It is the Christians, therefore, who push the Jews into poverty and bad morals; it is the circumstances created by them that "entail necessarily that the Jewish nation be a miserable and despised people," whose "slavish state" rules out that it possess "the virtues of a magnanimous soul [groJfmiithige Seele]" (11). However, when causes are removed, so are their effects (11). Consequently, if a sovereign were to eradicate the causes of their misery, the Jews would become the Christians' equals. Jews and Christians, Levi Israel urges, "posses the self-same bodies and souls, and the self-same capacities of the body and the mind" ("da sie eben solche Cirper und Seelen, eben solche Fdhigkeiten des Leibes und Geistes besitzen"; 11), a memorable phrase to which we will come back. It has been made clear, Levi Israel concludes-and this is the pinnacle of his letter-that giving the Jews "equal privileges with the other inhabitants of the country [gleichmdiiige Vorrechte mit den iibrigen Einwohnern]" will bring happi- ness to an "abandoned nation" and at the same time lead to the increase of the num- ber of subjects and of the country's wealth. These developments will eventually put an end to the Christians' aversion toward the Jews (12). Levi Israel expresses the hope that the philosopher, his correspondent, will subscribe to the arguments he has adduced, and asks him to include them in his forthcoming treatise (12). He adds a personal call, or rather challenge: If only you could assume the role that Le Fort assumed with respect to Peter the Great, then perhaps there will be a (Ger- man) prince who would "unite the strongest mind with the greatest power" and free the Jewish nation from its low state.14 "Should this happen," Levi Israel assures, "I am certain that the reverence [Ehrfurcht] they [the Jews] will feel toward that prince will lead them to believe that their hope for the coming of a Messiah has been fulfilled in his person." They will express their immense gratitude both through material sacrifices, and by inscribing him in their and their descendents' memory and in Jewish history (13). In his reply, the philosopher states that he finds the submitted propositions "congenial": not only do they concern his esteemed friend's nation, but he would assent to them even if he were the Jews' enemy, simply because they agree with 14. A footnote (p. 13) explains that Le Fort was "a member of the suite of a Danish ambassador to Moscow," whose reports of the excellent social institutions in France, England, Holland, and other countries induced the prince of Moscow, the later Czar Peter the Great, to make reforms aiming to "free the Russian nation from its barbarian state." Francois Le Fort (1656-1699) of Geneva arrived in Mos- cow in 1675 and worked first as a secretary of the Danish ambassador and later of the English ambas- sador. In 1689, he became the close adviser of Peter I or Peter the Great (1672-1725), Czar of Russia (1682-1725) and was at the origin of many modern reforms, including the foundation of Saint Peters- burg (1703). 303</page><page sequence="6">Gad Freudenthal the truth and because the "proofs" are compelling (14-15). Having fully accept- ed Levi Israel's ideas, the philosopher consolidates them with further arguments. The proposals put forward by Levi Israel have already been implemented in Hol- land and England, he argues, where Jews can buy land and real estate, and also ex- ercise professions. Owing to their good manners, their splendor, and their good taste, some of these Jews have even been ennobled: this lays to rest the erroneous notion that the Jews are the only exception to the rule that education and wealth can make everyone worthy of belonging to the nobility (15). At this point, the text inserts (16) a footnote consisting of two short para- graphs. The first states that not only do the Jews in England have all the above- mentioned rights, but a bill has been put before the Upper House of Parliament that they be naturalized. The second, preceded by the acronym "N.B.," adds that "it can now be reported to the reader" that this bill has already been passed by both houses of Parliament and has been approved by the king, adding that the news concern- ing this matter, as well as the text of the bill itself, are given in the Appendix.'5 We will come back to the significance of this footnote later. Having granted Jews freedom, the philosopher continues, the rulers of En- gland and Holland had extremely wealthy Jews among their subjects: "a Pinto, a Dulitz, and a Suasso."'16 Specifically, he adds, Suasso lent Prince William of Or- 15. This abbreviation (which stands for notabene) clearly carries here the meaning of"P.S."; cf. the following words: "it can now be reported.. .". 16. The financier Isaac De Pinto (1715-1787) lived in Amsterdam in the 1740s and 1750s, "en- joying a spectacular personal wealth" (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 60 vols. [Oxford, 2004], 44:385-85). He later wrote several important books on national economy and engaged a con- troversy with Voltaire over the latter's anti-Semitism. See also Herman Prins Salomon, "The 'De Pinto' manuscript. A Seventeenth-Century Marrano Family History," Studia Rosenthaliana 9 (1975): 1-62; Peter Buijs and Irene Faber, "Sources Relating to the History of Portuguese-Jewish Families. The De Pinto and Lopes Suasso Family," Studia Rosenthaliana 32, no. 2 (1998): 190-94. The name "Dulitz" is a corruption of"de Liz." The author must have had in mind Jacob Lopez de Liz, who was a wealthy art lover and bon vivant of Portuguese origin who lived in The Hague from the 1720s to after 1742. He belonged to the high society, funded an orchestra and a theater, and owned a large library and a vast collection of valuable objects. In 1739, he was attacked by Pierre Desforges, the director of the French Comedy in The Hague, who apparently felt threatened by de Liz's theater. Desforge's MWmoires anec- dotes pour servir c l 'histoire de M. Duliz, et la suite de ses aventures apres la catastrophe de celle de Mademoiselle Pelissier, Actrice de l'Opera de Paris (London [in fact: Paris], 1739) was quickly trans- lated into German as Des reichen holldndischen Juden Franz Duliz geheime seltsame Begebenheiten ... (Bastia [i.e., Frankfurt]: Verlegts Francesco Giovanni Ottoiano, Hof-Buchhindler [i.e., Stock], 1739). This was barely a year after Joseph Siiss Oppenheimer, known as "Jud Siiss," was hanged in Stuttgart (February 4, 1738), an event to which the title page of the German edition of the book allud- ed through an engraving showing SiiB' hanging with the following charming caption: "Der SiiU hingt hier und Diilitz dort // So find die Wolliist ihren Ort." (The spelling "Diilitz" in this caption suggests that this book may have been the author's source of information on Dulitz/de Liz.) In 1742, de Liz had a legal guardian appointed over him at the request of his only daughter Sara and her husband Abraham, alias Francisco Lopes Suasso. The above information is all drawn from Mozes Heiman Gans, Memor- book: History of Dutch Jewry from the Renaissance to 1940, trans. Arnold J. Pomerans (Baarn: Bosch &amp; Keuning, 1977), 241. I am most grateful to Odette Vlessing of the Amsterdam Municipal Archive for having identified the unknown "Dulitz" as "de Liz" and to Resianne Fontaine of the University of Amsterdam for having provided me with a photocopy from the Memorbook. Dutch testaments were 304</page><page sequence="7">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) ange very considerable sums of money.17 England and Holland thus benefited from great fortunes of the Jews who fled the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal (16). Had they followed "the voice of superstition and self-interest [Eigennutz]" and not abolished the oppression [Unterdriickung] of the Jews, which is still perpetuated in other countries, they would not have benefited from this wealth and the wealth created by Jews generally. Levi Israel's position, the philosopher argues, is sus- tained by the consideration that those who envy the affluence of England and Hol- land cannot disapprove of the means that have produced it (17). The philosopher continues by expressing his "astonishment" about the Jews' oppression, which is "unjust" and also "extremely detrimental" to the Christian countries that practice it (17): wherever the Jews are granted freedom they enrich the host country through their work and industry, but they are considered as use- less subjects. That this perception is entirely wrong is shown by the Portuguese Jews, who in all respects are the Christians' equals. Moreover, through a heroic ef- fort, even a few "German Jews" (verschiedene der Deutschen Juden) have suc- ceeded to free themselves from misery and deficient education. The contemporary Russians similarly show that a people can be made "polite" (gesittet) through the willed decision of a monarch (18). In the following paragraph (18-19), printed in bold characters, the philoso- pher puts in the mouth of the Jews the following statements, which, he says, they can legitimately cry out: "You evil Christians: stop persecuting us! ... Can you demand that we love a religion that ostensibly instructs you [Christians] to hate us? ... Reject our [religious] errors, but not our persons!" Rather, you Christians should try to win our hearts through charity, compassion with one's neighbors, and love of humankind: "For the God that you and we worship is kindhearted." The concluding sentence encapsulates the philosopher's argumentation, which contin- uously oscillates between the economic and the moral points of view: "pay heed to justice, or at least to your own interest." Switching back to economic-utilitarian arguments, the philosopher states that he endorses his correspondent's argument to the effect that a "Jewish colony" enjoying "all freedoms" will be as beneficial to the state as any other population (19-20). He therefore wishes that these freedoms no longer be denied to the Jew- ish nation. As a "citizen of the terrestrial globe" (als ein Mitbiirger des Erdkreis- es) he will consequently integrate his correspondent's suggestions into his Politik, and expresses his hope that he will be able to expose them with sufficient force. He adds, however, that he does not share Levi Israel's confidence that this part of his treatise will contribute anything to saving the latter's "compatriots" from their miserable state (20-21). then registered in English in London and three testaments by members of the de Liz family are regis- tered between 1725 and 1781 in the British National Archives (Prerogative Court of Canterbury and related Probate Jurisdictions: Will Registers); the last (dated April 12, 1781) is by Sara Suasso de Liz, Jacob Lopez de Liz's daughter. I am very grateful to Michael Silber for this piece of information. For Suasso see next note. 17. The author refers to Antonio (Isaac) Lopez Suasso (second half of the seventeenth centu- ry), who was indeed ennobled (as stated by the philosopher); see EJ, 15:467; Daniel Swetschinski and Loeki Schonduve, De Familie Lopes Suasso, Financiers van Willem III/The Lopes Suasso Family, 305</page><page sequence="8">Gad Freudenthal To justify the just expressed skepticism, the philosopher next turns to possi- ble hindrances that may foil Levi Israel's and his own project. Even if a ruler in- tended to make a step in the right direction, a single unfortunate event can bring it to naught, given that "the entire nation-the clergy, the bourgeois in the towns, and the inhabitants of the countryside"-are looking for an opportunity to thwart it (21). To illustrate his point that the Jews' status depends on unforeseeable circum- stances, the philosopher draws a parallel between them and the French Protestants. The latter contributed much to their country's wealth and enjoyed the favor of Louis XIV; yet, after the death of Colbert and following "unfounded reports" made to the king by two advisers, they came to be considered as rebels and were perse- cuted (21-22).18 This thought is then carried further: "Your brethren, esteemed friend, are Europe's Huguenots: your plea is in some respect identical with that of the Reformed in France" (22). The philosopher next evokes in a single sentence the religious opposition as another probable source of danger: the clerics, he anticipates, will argue that a ruler is not entitled to bring to an end the misery of a people that God's will has made into the subject of disdain in Christendom (22). Another possible source of oppo- sition to the improvement of the Jews' state is that people as a rule prefer their own personal good to the general welfare. Considering that they regard with envy their own coreligionists, how much more would they oppose a ruler's intention to favor the immigration of a nation they loathe? They would draw on all possible argu- ments to make the case that it is impossible that Christian and Jewish citizens can thrive simultaneously (23). These considerations concerning likely sources of opposition to the philoso- pher's and Levi Israel's scheme lead the philosopher to conclude in a rather pes- simistic note: "Let us therefore, worthy friend, content ourselves with the hope that the Jews will eventually make themselves better mannered [gesitteter] and thus be less hated by the Christians and ultimately acquire the citizen's right [Biirger- Recht] in all countries" (23). He thus seems to have abandoned the hope that the ruler's action could rapidly improve the Jews' state. But this pessimism does not last: "I have gone too far in my doubts," he immediately says, and comes back to his-and Levi Israel's-original notion. For the happiness of the Jewish people, only a single instant is needed, he proclaims, namely the instant in which a monarch would have the will to embody humanity's kindness, to resist superstition, and to respond to the desire of a "great nation" that he become its sovereign and bene- factor (23-24). The Schreiben's third and last part is an Anhang (appendix) consisting of ma- terial related to the English so-called Jew Bill of 1753. We need not here go into the history of that bill, introduced in the House of Lords on April 3,1753, passed by Parliament in late June and, following vehement popular clamor against it, was Bankers to William III (Zwolle: Waanders, 1988). A member of this family, Francisco Lopes Suasso, was married to Sara, Jacob Lopez de Liz's daughter; see last note and Buijs and Faber, "Sources Re- lating to... the De Pinto and Lopes Suasso Family," in Swetschinski and Schonduve, De Familie Lopes Suasso, Financiers van Willem III. 18. The philosopher, of course, has in mind the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. 306</page><page sequence="9">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) repealed in December 1753.19 This Anhang reproduces press reports (to whose source we will come back), carrying the story from April to up to June 22, 1753, that is, after the law was passed but before it was repealed. I discuss the Anhang in detail below (Appendix I). Having presented in outline the contents of the Schreiben, I now turn to the question of its authorship. III. THE SCHREIBEN. REAL CORRESPONDENCE OR LITERARY DEVICE? The Schreiben presents itself as a letter written by the Jew Levi Israel to the philosopher R.C.D.N., and the latter's answer. But the few readers of the Schreiben quickly perceived that this "correspondence" is a literary fiction. Lessing, its first reader, nonchalantly referred to "the author" of the entire Schreiben, without even feeling a need to justify why he does not take at face value the Schreiben's claim to be a correspondence between a Jew and a non-Jew.20 The anonymous reviewer in Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek, by contrast, explicitly remarked that both texts "sing with the very same tone [singt aus eben dem Tone]" and that their style makes it obvious that they "flowed from a single pen."21 Scholars, too, shared this impression. Johannes Dominicus, the author of a short work on Lessing's attitude to the Jews, alerted to the existence of the Schreiben through Lessing's review, as- cribed to "Levi Israel" the entire pamphlet: He opined that the philosopher's re- sponse to the latter's epistle was "rather unphilosophical," and was written by a "fictional philosopher."22 The view that the entire Schreiben was written by a sin- gle person was shared also by Jacob Katz and Jacob Toury.23 This contention has been based, it seems, mainly on impressionistic appre- ciations of style. It can be corroborated by the following observations. Consider the sequence of events as presented in the Schreiben if taken at face value. At an unknown date, the philosopher sent his good friend Levi Israel the draft of his book, perhaps entitled Politik, asking for his comments. Levi Israel responded with an epistle dated March 24, 1753, suggesting to the philosopher to include in his treatise arguments in favor of a policy aiming at increasing the population by a lib- eral policy toward the Jews. Impressed by this line of reasoning, which had total- 19. The most detailed account is: Thomas S.

At the same time, on April 30, 1753, he also sent Levi Israel an enthusiastic answer to his letter. Now, in this missive, the philosopher utters no word about any intention to publish a brochure containing the correspondence (being presumably too busy with writing his own, assuredly weighty treatise). The Schreiben's narrative thus implies that it was Levi Israel who took the initiative to bring to print the epistolary exchange and who eventually did so: He put together a pamphlet consisting of his own and the philosopher's texts, added the Anhang, and the entire Schreiben eines Juden an einen Philosophen nebst der Antwort appeared in July or early August 1753.24 The presence of the Jew Bill in the Schreiben deserves special attention. While Levi Israel's letter naturally does not allude to it (it is ostensibly dated March 24, i.e., before the bill was put before Parliament), the bill is briefly mentioned in the footnote to the philosopher's letter: the first part of this footnote laconically mentions that a bill concerning the "naturalization of the Jews" had been submit- ted to the English House of Lords; its second part, purportedly added only in the last minute before going to print, adds that the bill has been passed and directs the reader to pertinent newspaper reports, reproduced (in translation) in the Anhang. As we just saw, the Schreiben 's own narrative implies that the Anhang is the work of Levi Israel; the same conclusion thus holds also of the footnote (or at least its second part).25 The scenario implied by the Schreiben posits an extraordinary, quite im- probable coincidence of two entirely independent sequences of events. One se- quence was triggered by the philosopher. He sent Levi Israel a draft of his treatise, to which the addressee replied by an epistle in which he brought up the Jewish as- pect that did not at all feature in the Politik. His suggestions having met with the philosopher's immediate and total approval, Levi Israel decided to bring to print their correspondence. The exchange itself allegedly took place in March-April 1753, with some additions (notably of the Anhang) made in June 1753. Concur- rently, the second, entirely unrelated sequence of events, concerning the enactment of the English Jew Bill, took place in London between early April and late June 1753. According to the Schreiben's narrative, the two sequences of events intersect, namely when the news reports concerning the Jew Bill reach the compiler of the Schreiben, precisely in time to be reproduced in the Anhang of the pamphlet he was just rushing to press (the first press report is dated April 6, 1753, and the last, the news of the Bill's final enactment, is dated June 22, 1753). The extraordinary fea- ture of the Schreiben is thus that both allegedly independent sequences of events felicitously converge: according to the narrative offered by the Schreiben, Levi Is- rael must have been dumbfounded one morning when, in early April, barely two weeks after having submitted to the philosopher his ideas on bettering the status of 24. Lessing's review appeared in the Berliner privilegirte Zeitung dated Saturday, August 4, 1753. 25. Taking the correspondence at face value, this second part of the footnote cannot have been written by the philosopher: For one thing, it directly addresses the reader of the Schreiben and, as not- ed, the philosopher does not at all allude to an impending publication; for another, the philosopher's re- ply is dated April 30, 1753, whereas the Anhang contains reports stretching from April 6, to June 22, 1753 (see Appendix I). 308</page><page sequence="11">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) Jews in Prussia, he learned from the newspaper that a bill which looked as if it had been read off his mind was put before the English Parliament in far-away London. ("Wondrous are the Lord's ways," he would perhaps have muttered to himself.) All this is too good to be true, however: Unless we assume a preestablished harmony, the concatenation of events as proposed by the Schreiben is hardly cred- ible. The chronology implied by the Schreiben is also belied by the fact that the philosopher's reply, allegedly written on April 30, 1753, makes no allusion to the immediately relevant and encouraging developments in England of which Levi Is- rael was so keenly aware. The following reconstruction seems more likely. In early April 1753, a per- son interested in the state of the Jews in Germany-he who was to be the author of the entire Schreiben-learns that a bill concerning the naturalization of the Jews had been submitted to the English Parliament.26 This news gives him the idea to publish a call for what he takes to be an analogous improvement of the Jews' con- dition in Germany. (In point of fact, the bearing of the Jew Bill was rather limited, but like many of his contemporaries, the author of the Schreiben wrongly saw in it a step on the road to equality of rights.)27 He chooses to conceal the fact that his initiative is triggered by that bill, presumably so as not to create the impression that he was calling for an emulation of a foreign power. Having opted for the literary form of an epistolary exchange between a Jew and a Christian philosopher, and in- tent on creating the impression that the correspondence had begun independently of the news concerning the English bill, he dates the Jew's writing to March 24, and, moreover, ascribes the beginning of the correspondence to the philosopher's having sent his treatise to his correspondent even earlier. The author thus writes as if at the moment of replying to the philosopher Levi Israel did not know anything of the bill and as if the philosopher, whose letter is dated April 30, learned of it only after he had completed his letter and just as he was about to mail it (he refers to the bill only in the first part of the footnote, purportedly written by himself). At that first stage the Schreiben consisted only of the two alleged letters, including the first part of the footnote to the philosopher's letter. Subsequently, in late June 1753, when the author learned of the adoption of the bill, he added the second part of the footnote to the philosopher's letter and the Anhang: it appears that the good (but short-lived) news that the bill was approved by both houses of Parliament and by the king came as a surprise to the author just when he was about to bring his brochure to print ("it can now be reported to the reader that ... ").28 The upshot of our discussion so far is that the exchange of letters making up the Schreiben is a literary artifact. As Lessing and the reviewer in Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek perceived long ago, "Levi Israel" and "R.C.D.N." are both 26. The first part of the footnote to the philosopher's letter mentions merely that the bill has been submitted to the House of Lords, without refering to the subsequent events: It thus echoes pre- cisely the press report dated April 6, 1753, and not later reports. 27. Katz, "The Term 'Emancipation,'" 31. 28. It is possible of course, although I think unlikely, that the second part of the footnote is yet another artistic device used by the author to enhance the effect of his pamphlet and that the Schreiben was composed in a single stroke in late June. 309</page><page sequence="12">Gad Freudenthal fictive characters, and the Schreiben is the work of one author. Moreover, the Schreiben, the first call in German lands for equal civic rights for Jews, was trig- gered by the English Jew Bill, although the author sought to conceal this fact. Toury, it should be noted, intuitively perceived this and referred to the Schreiben as a "reaction" to the Jew Bill.29 IV THE AUTHOR OF THE SCHREIBEN: JEWISH OR CHRISTIAN? To identify the anonymous author of the Schreiben, we should begin by ask- ing whether he was a Christian or a Jew. Curiously, this important question, on which hinges our appreciation of the historic significance of Schreiben, has never been formulated explicitly.30 Internal evidence, I believe, establishes beyond doubt the author's Jewishness. Consider the following points. First, the author chose to present the entire Schreiben as the endeavor of a Jew, Levi Israel, to improve his brethren's condition in Germany, namely by per- suading the gentile philosopher to include in his treatise on political theory an ar- gument on the Jews' economic usefulness to the nation. It furthermore intimates that the correspondence and the Anhang were brought to print by Levi Israel. The Schreiben thus presents itself as a Jewish venture, a feature that is brought out with emphasis in the very title page, which announces: Schreiben eines Juden, the philosopher's part being reduced to a mere Antwort. Now for a Christian wishing to call for the improvement of the condition of the Jews with purportedly neutral, purely economic arguments it would clearly have been highly counterproductive to present it as the work of a Jew, who can be presumed to act out of partisan in- terest. Conversely, on the part of a Jew who (encouraged by the English Jew Bill) wishes to issue such a call it seems natural to present it as a Jewish initiative, and it appears as a felicitous move on his part to present this initiative as having been approved and endorsed by a Christian "philosopher."31 The very way the Schreiben addresses itself to the reader thus clearly points to a Jewish author. It is doubtful that a Christian would go as far as to imagine a pamphlet whose 29. Toury, "Eine vergessene Friihschrift," 254; also: "the writing [i.e., the Schreiben] is doubt- less strongly influenced by the events in England" (256). 30. Lessing, we saw, simply referred to "the author" of the pamphlet. The reviewer in Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek stated that both parts of the Schreiben "flowed from one pen," but did not ask whether it was moved by a Jewish or a Christian hand. The author of the annotations accompany- ing his re-edition of the Schreiben in 1759 doubted that the author of the first part was Jewish (Schrei- ben, 2nd ed., 16 note e: "gesetzt auch, der erste Brief wire wirklich von einem Juden geschrieben, woran doch aus mehr als einer Ursache zu zweifeln ... "). Similarly, Jacob Toury, who did not recognize that the correspondence was fictive, examined and rejected possible identifications of "Levi Israel," and finally concluded, without argument, that he was "a construction of the non-Jewish author" ("Eine vergessene Friihschrift," 263). Dominicus, by contrast, identifying "Levi Israel" with Israel Zamosc, referred to the author of the entire Schreiben as "the Jewish letter writer" (Dominicus, Lessings Stel- lung, 20-21); see also below Appendix III. 31. Conceivably, the Jewish author could also have tried to present it as the work of a Christian. We will understand below why he did not: the author, as I will identify him, was intent on being a "go- between" for Jewish and Christian societies, and the Schreiben's structure as a dialogue between a Jew and a Christian reflects his thought and motivations. 310</page><page sequence="13">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) central piece would be a letter written by a Jew, with that of the Christian, that is, his "own" contribution, being only the answer to it.32 Specifically, we should re- member that up until 1753, very few works in German had ever been published by Jews (with the exception of converts): when Moses Mendelssohn published his first German writing this was perceived as a sensation.33 It seems rather unlikely, therefore, that a Christian would have fathomed the idea of ascribing to a Jew a piece of German writing, one which would have been the very first of its kind. In 1753, only a Jew who was himself capable of writing on matters of national econ- omy in German could dare to conceive of the then rather improbable character of "Levi Israel."34 Moreover, had a Christian author wished to issue a call on behalf of the Jews, he would presumably have done so in a plain (if perhaps anonymous) treatise on politics and national economy, precisely of the kind ascribed to the philosopher in the Schreiben. From the vantage point of a Christian interested in his country's wel- fare, the Jews are no party or partner to the debate and he would have no reason to choose the literary device of a fictive correspondence with a Jew. Still less would he have reason to present the propositions he brought forward as coming from a Jew. By contrast, the Jewish author writes from the vantage point of Jewish self in- terest, and thus it seems useful to present the arguments as if they were endorsed by a neutral Christian who argues from a purely "professional" stance. The contention that the Schreiben was written by a Jew is strengthened by its contents. Although "Levi Israel" and the philosopher both ground their argu- mentation essentially in economic (mercantilist) considerations, with no explicit reference to anything Jewish or Christian, careful reading reveals one or two fair- ly subtle considerations which seem to point to a Jewish authorship. The first is one of the two allusions our text makes to the Messiah. At the very end of his epis- tle, Levi Israel writes that if the sovereign grants Jews the requested rights, then "the reverence they [the Jews] will feel toward that prince will lead them to believe that their hope for the coming of a Messiah has been fulfilled in his person" (13). This quite startling idea, it seems, can have come only from the pen of a Jew, in- deed only from a Jew subscribing to the view of the Messianic era propounded by Moses Maimonides (1137/8-1204). For even if we make allowance for a thick dose of flattery (in 1753 Prussia, the above phrase amounted to suggesting that should Frederick II grant civic rights to the Jews, they would consider him as the Messiah), this idea still distinctively echoes Maimonides' rationalist idea of polit- ical and realist Messianism (as opposed to the much more common apocalyptic 32. True, the Marquis d'Argens composed his Lettres juives (1738) as if they were written by a Jew. This work is not comparable to the Schreiben inasmuch as d'Argens used the Jews only as a kind of external viewpoint from which to examine Christian society. 33. One of the very rare exceptions to this rule is Raphael Levi Hannover (1685-1779), who in the late 1740s and 1750s published in German a few books of elementary mathematics; see: Steven and Henry Schwarzschild, "Two Lives in the Jewish Friihaufklirung: Raphael Levi Hannover and Moses Abraham Wolff," Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook 29 (1984): 229-76, on 242-43. 34. Lessing, it is true, in Die Juden imagined the "improbable" figure of a noble Jew. But his literary imagination attributed to his hero magnanimous moral qualities, not yet intellectual excellence, which was even more improbable. 311</page><page sequence="14">Gad Freudenthal notions of Messianism).35 By contrast, this idea is so far removed from the Chris- tian idea of the Messiah that it seems to me next to impossible that it could occur to a Christian, even if he tried to think as a Jew.36 A further possible indication of a Jewish authorship is this. As noted earlier, Levi Israel argues that at the present enlightened times, it can be recognized that the miserable state of the Jews is in part caused by laws enacted by Christians, which enforced on the Jews "customs" leading to their decline, which lasts to this very day (11). Specifically, "no care is taken of the Jews' education in the free arts, the sciences, and physical exercises [Man triigetfiir den Unterricht der Juden in den freyen Kiinsten, Wissenschaften und Leibesiibungen keine Vorsorge]" (12). Now allusion to deficient education of the Jews was soon to become a character- istic topos of the self-criticism of the Haskalah. Although it was raised also by non- Jewish thinkers who wanted to improve the Jews' lot, its formulation is so close to that used by maskilim that it seems to confirm that it was written by a Jew. Let me finally note that the author of the anonymous review of the Schreiben in Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek, who wrote from an emphatically declared Christian vantage point, seems to have felt that the text attributed to the philoso- pher was not written by a Christian: he opines that the philosopher knows little about Christian theology or about Christians tout court.37 The annotator of the 1759 re-edition similarly found fault with the philosopher's knowledge of Chris- 35.

The author of the 1759 edition of the Schreiben, who commented on it from a decidedly Christian viewpoint, rejected the idea that the Jews be given civil rights qua Jews, suggesting instead that all should be done to convert them to Christianity; see Schreiben (1759 ed.), "Vorbericht," fol. 5b- 6a. This corresponds to an established trend in contemporary German literature: Pietists favored a col- lective, national conversion of the Jews at the end of days after the Return to Zion to fulfill the prophe- cies of the second coming. This trend is associated, for example, with the name of Joh. Heinrich Callenberg; see Toury, "Die Behandlung jiidischer Problematik," 15. Interestingly, in 1751, barely two years before the Schreiben was published, the Christian Hebraist and missionary David Friedrich Megerlin (1698-1778) published a book containing inter alia a German translation of Hilkhot mela- khim 11-12, the text in which Maimonides describes his view of the messianic times (reproduced in Niew6hner, Maimonides. AuJkldrung und Toleranz, 47-54); this German text does not seem to have been known to the author of the Schreiben. The Schreiben's second allusion to the Messiah occurs when Levi Israel ascribes to the philosopher the idea that the Christian Messiah (who has already come) and the Jewish Messiah (who still is to come) are equally acceptable (6). This thought, too, although less distinctively, is easier attributable to an (enlightened) Jew than to a Christian (enlightened or not). 37. Krafts neue theologische Bibliothek, op. cit. 185n (note the phrase: "had the philosopher been a Christian or endeavored to be one.. ."). The author admittedly also writes that Levi Israel "must have known as little of the Jewish as of the Christian [theological] postulates" (185n), but the argu- mentation that follows concerns only his alleged ignorance of the principles of Christianity. 312</page><page sequence="15">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) tians.38 It thus seems that while the Schreiben's camouflage as an exchange be- tween a Jew and a Christian philosopher was quite ably done, it yet had some flaws that made some of its Christian readers skeptical. We may thus conclude, I believe, that the Schreiben is the work of a Jew. In- deed, "Levi Israel" is a name a Jewish author would choose to denote any Jew, that is, the representative Jew in general. A last suggestion. It seems to me that the presentation of the Schreiben as an exchange started by an initially neutral philosopher with "a Jew" whose arguments carry the day and lead the former to adhere to the Jewish cause may have been in- spired by a classic of medieval Jewish thought: Judah Halevi's Kuzari. As is well known, this work of "Apology for a Despised Religion" is presented as consisting essentially of a dialogue between the King of the Khazars and a learned Jew, in which the former, although skeptical at the outset, is gradually convinced of the truth of the Jewish religion. The Schreiben resembles the Kuzari not only in its di- alogical form, in which an impartial interlocutor is led to support the Jewish cause, but also in having a frame story. It seems possible that both features were adapted from the Kuzari, although to be sure this is a surmise that cannot be further sub- stantiated. Because in eighteenth-century Germany the Kuzari was known only to very few non-Jews, its possible echo in the Schreiben again suggests a Jewish au- thorship.39 I will argue below that the author of the Schreiben, as I will identify him, was indeed particularly well acquainted with the Kuzari. V THE SCHREIBEN. THE LESSING CONNECTION Jacob Toury, who devoted to the Schreiben the most detailed study to date, already felt that it was somehow connected to Lessing. He observed that Lessing discussed the Schreiben so soon after its appearance in print that one may suspect that he saw it in manuscript prior to its publication. Toury also noted that in his exceptionally long and warm review of the Schreiben, Lessing clearly identified himself with its contents. In addition, Lessing's reference to "the author" of the Schreiben suggests that Lessing knew (rather than guessed or surmised) that the Schreiben was the work of a single author. Toury concluded that "it is probable that [Lessing] was acquainted with the author and endorsed his opinions.... We can suppose that the author [of the Schreiben] must somehow have been in touch with Lessing's circles."40 In what follows, I will endeavor to substantiate Toury's thesis and also seek to identify Lessing's role in the genesis and publication of the Schreiben. Before that, a few words on Lessing's attitude to the Jews are in order. 38. Schreiben eines Juden, 2nd ed., 33-34 (note k). The annotator believed that the first part of the Schreiben, signed by "Levi Israel," was not written by a Jew and consequently the inverse possi- bility, namely that the author of the second part was not a Christian, did not at all occur to him. 39. Those not knowing Hebrew could read the Kuzari only in Johannes Buxtorf II's Latin transla- tion published in Basel in 1660. A full German translation was published only in 1853 (by David Cassel). 40. Toury, "Eine vergessene Friihschrift," 263-64. This view is followed in Britta L.

Jahrhundert (Miinster/New York: Waxmann Verlag, 2002), 98-99, but without a renewed examination of the text. 313</page><page sequence="16">Gad Freudenthal Culminating in Nathan der Weise of 1779, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's atti- tude to Jews was consistently positive throughout his life.41 This is too well known to be discussed here in any detail, and I will simply recall a few facts related to Lessing's early acquaintance with and attitude to Judaism, which are directly rel- evant to the purpose at hand.42 Curiously, the roots of Lessing's exceptional phi- lo-semitic outlook are unknown.43 Already in his very first play, Der junge Gelehrte (1748), written at a time at which he was not yet acquainted with either of his future Jewish friends Gumpertz or Mendelssohn, Lessing evinced a sur- prising familiarity with facts related to Judaism. He refers in Scene 1 to "des Ben Maimon Jad chasaka," noting that it is in Hebrew. Indeed, we learn (Scene 1) that the play's hero, the young scholar who doubtless borrowed many of his traits from Lessing himself, had a "perfect knowledge" of six foreign languages, one of which was Hebrew (a language Lessing had indeed studied already at the age of twelve at St. Afra). We also learn that a rabbi called on the young scholar at his home. This awareness of things Jewish is certainly exceptional for the time. Much better known is Lessing's next comedy Die Juden, published in 1754 but completed al- ready in 1749. Lessing therein describes a traveling Jew (not recognized as such), who saves a nobleman from robbers, and he depicts the nobleman's distressed re- action when he learns that his selfless and generous savior is a Jew.44 This play, in which Lessing skillfully unmasks and denounces the anti-Jewish prejudices in con- temporary German upper classes and which in some respects foreshadows Nathan der Weise, has become a classic of the upcoming Enlightenment and has secured Lessing a place in the history of the evolution of a tolerant attitude toward Jews in 41. With one exception: in 1751, following an infamous dispute between Voltaire and a Jewish money lender, Lessing wrote an epigram (published in 1753) in which, at the very least, he uses quite derogatory stereotypes of Jews. They show how long was the way that even a Lessing had to travel be- fore freeing himself of ubiquitous prejudices. Cf. Wilfried Barner, "Vorurteil, Empirie, Rettung.

Danzel made the intriguing suggestion that Lessing's desire to break out of conventional artistic forms and norms induced him to seek the company of social outsiders: actors, Jews and sol- diers, in whose company he could "ohne alle hergebrachten Riicksichten seinen ganzen Menschen ein- bringen." See Theodor W. Danzel and Gottschak E. Guhrauer, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Sein Leben und seine Werke (Berlin: T. Hoffmann, 1880-1881), 83 (see also 270). Barner ("Vorurteil, Empirie, Rettung," 61-64) has pointedly argued that Lessing's early familiarity with Jews could be a result of his having observed East European Jews on the way to and during the Leipzig fairs. It is not entirely clear, however, how this familiarity may have positively influenced Lessing's attitude toward Jews. 44. Die Juden was one of the first, but not the very first, German literary work to portray a pos- itive Jewish figure. See, for example, Robertson, The 'Jewish Question 'in German Literature, 33-34; Bourel, Moses Mendelssohn, 89-91 points out the differences between Die Juden and its predecessors. 314</page><page sequence="17">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) Germany. It is thus not at all surprising that in 1753 he should endorse the stand- point expressed by the Schreiben in exceptionally strong terms. But Lessing's involvement with the Schreiben, I will now argue, was far from being limited to an a posteriori endorsement. This has to do with Lessing's central position in the publishing house that published the Schreiben.45 Shortly after his arrival in Berlin in December 1748, Lessing became acquainted with Johann An- dreas Riidiger (1683-175 1), one of the greatest publishers and booksellers in Ger- many, whose rich library he put in order.46 In 1750, Riidiger proposed to Lessing that he replace Christlob Mylius (1722-1754)47 as editor-in-chief of the Berlini- sche privilegirte Zeitung, published by him, but Lessing declined. After Riidiger's death, his publishing house merged with that of his son-in-law, Christian Friedrich Vo3 (1722-1798). Vo3, who had met Lessing through Riidiger in 1748 and who was by then a close friend of his, again offered Lessing the editorship of the Berlini- sche privilegirte Zeitung (now commonly referred to as the Vossische Zeitung).48 In February 1751, Lessing accepted the post, albeit under the condition that he would be responsible only for the cultural (and not the political) part. Lessing as- sumed this task throughout his two sojourns in Berlin-most of 1751 and then from December 1752 to October 1755-leaving his mark on the newspaper for decades to come. In 1753, the Berlinische privilegirte Zeitung was renamed Ber- linische Privilegirte Staats- und gelehrte Zeitung, a change clearly reflecting the increasing weight of the part for which Lessing was responsible.49 Lessing quickly became a central figure both in VoW's newspaper and in his publishing house, whose intellectual profile he largely determined.

Encouraged by Lessing, Mendelssohn (who became acquainted with Lessing in 1754) wrote what was to be his first book: Philosophische Gesprdche. He gave Lessing the manu- script, asking for his opinion. For some time Lessing gave no news of the matter, and Mendelssohn was too embarrassed to press him. During this time, and with- out the prior knowledge of the author, Lessing arranged for the publication of the book, which was published by VoB in early 1755.51 As Alexander Altmann re- marks, the timid Mendelssohn appears to have needed Lessing's initiative to be launched into the literary world.52 Although he had been directly responsible for the publication, Lessing had no qualms about reviewing the book immediately fol- lowing its appearance in the Berlinische privilegirte Zeitung (March 1, 1755).53 Similarly, when Mendelssohn's next work, Ober die Empfindungen, was published later in same year-again by VoB and presumably also with Lessing as intermedi- ary-Lessing was quick to review it, again in the Berlinische privilegirte Zeitung (September 4, 1755).54 Lessing had an expansive idea of his role in the Republic of Letters, and he did not content himself with publishing manuscripts submitted to him. Thus, in ad- dition to the two instances just considered, he asked Mendelssohn for a translation of Rousseau's Discours on the origin of the inequality among men, and when Mendelssohn sent him the manuscript in January 1756, he quickly saw it to print with VoB.55 Mendelssohn's essay "Gedanken von der Wahrscheinlichkeit" was published by Vof3 in 1756, soon after Mendelssohn had sent Lessing the manu- script.56 Finally, let us recall that Lessing was also the editor of the Theatralische Bibliothek (1754-1758), also published by VoB, in which he published his review of the Schreiben, as well as his and Mendelssohn's rejoinders to Michaelis' criti- cism of Lessing's Die Juden. It thus seems certain that at the very least the 50. Friedrich II, Schreiben an das Publicum; Zweytes Schreiben an das Publicum; and Drittes Schreiben an das Publicum, trans.

While anonymous publications were fairly common at this period of the ear- ly Enlightenment, it seems that Lessing was particularly fond of them. Mendels- sohn's Philosophische Gesprdche, Ober die Empfindungen, and the translation of Rousseau's Discours, all published by Vo13, appeared anonymously. And, in 1755, when Lessing and Mendelssohn together composed Pope ein Metaphysiker!, they also published it anonymously.57 Again, in 1756, Mendelssohn wrote "Send- schreiben an einen jungen Gelehrten zu B.," published in vol. 2 of Vermischte Ab- handlungen und Urtheile fiber das Neueste aus der Gelehrsamkeit, a periodical published by Vo.3: the short text was published anonymously, but Lessing was in- formed and probably involved.58 Even more important, Mendelssohn's letter to Gumpertz in reaction to Michaelis' criticism of Lessing's Die Juden was pub- lished-by Lessing-anonymously again.59 And even late in life, between 1774 and 1778, Lessing posthumously published parts of a work by the rationalist the- ologian Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694-1768), presenting it as an anonymous manuscript he discovered in the Wolfenbiittel library. The Schreiben, let us recall, was published anonymously in 1753 by Vo13. Lessing, we saw, was in total agreement with its contents, obviously was (as Toury already perceived) in contact with the anonymous author prior to the publication, and held a central position with its publisher. Putting two and two together, we now realize that the Schreiben must have been brought to print by none other than Less- ing. Just as Lessing initiated the publication by Vo13 of Mendelssohn's books, sub- sequently writing enthusiastic reviews of some of them, so also he must have been behind the publication by the same publisher of the Schreiben, which he was quick to review glowingly. An anonymous publication needs a strong "promoter" in the publishing house, all the more so in politically sensitive cases such as the present one (where the call for the improvement of the status of Jews appeared merely three years after Friedrich II's General Regulation had toughened the legislation on Jews).60 For such an enterprise, the young Lessing was the right man, and the Schreiben fits well within the fairly long series of books published by Lessing in 1753 chez Vol3. Indeed, in those years Lessing was acquiring a reputation as an ex- pert in bringing to print anonymous books.61 Thus, when in 1755 Lessing and 57. And for good reason, because its objective was to embarrass the influential anti-Leibnizian fraction of the Acadimie which was led by Maupertuis.

In October 1755, Lessing left Berlin and his position in Christian Friedrich Vof's publish- ing house, and Mendelssohn from now on published his writings with other publishers, notably Friedrich Nicolai; only his two very last books were again published by VoB (1785, 1786). Holzboog, "Moses Mendelssohn und die Situation von Autor und Verleger" (226), gives a useful overview of the distribution of Mendelssohn's works among his publishers. 60.

Thus by virtue of the very fact that the Schreiben was published anonymously by VoB, it bears Lessing's fingerprints. The text possibly contains yet another indication of Lessing's involvement. We already came across the phrase (in Levi Israel's letter) stating that the Jews "possess the self-same bodies and souls [as the Christians], and the self-same ca- pacities of the body and the mind" ("da sie eben solche C6rper und Seelen, eben solche Fdhigkeiten des Leibes und Geistes besitzen"; 11). There can be little doubt that this phrase echoes Shylock's famous speech "I am a Jew": I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?63 Now in 1753, Shakespeare was virtually unknown in German-speaking lands. Jo- hann Christoph Gottsched (1700-1766), who then still dominated German letters, ferociously denigrated Shakespeare (although he apparently read-in transla- tion-only Julius Caesar, the first and for many years only play to be integrally translated into German [1741 ]).64 It is well known that Lessing played a pivotal role in reversing this prevailing negative attitude: he did so notably by launching (in 1759) a frontal and eventually successful attack on Gottsched and urging the introduction of the Englishman's dramas into Germany. Yet as early as 1750, Less- ing had already referred positively to Shakespeare, listing his plays among those that should be introduced into Germany, and his writings indeed include one ex- 79-81, clearly shows that at the time Lessing was perceived as the designated middleman for having books published by VoB anonymously. 62.

The Shakespearean motif perhaps also reverberates in Levi Israel's remark that that nothing in the "constitution of the [Jews'] bodies" rules out that they become soldiers. 64.

Many years later, in 1779, Nathan der Weise was to contain a distant reverberation of both texts: "Sind Christen und Juden eher Christ und Jude als Mensch?"66 The last observation naturally raises the question: could Lessing himself have composed the Schreiben? This, I think, is certainly not the case. For one thing, we have seen that in all likelihood the author was Jewish. Moreover, the Schreiben's entire line of argument is based on economic and political considerations, ideas that are totally absent from Lessing's thought and writings and in which Lessing was uninterested; Lessing's arguments in favor of the Jews were instead grounded in humanistic ideas and formulated in terms of tolerance-ideas and terms that are conspicuously absent from the Schreiben.67 Last, we can safely assume that had Lessing been the author of the Schreiben he would have mentioned this fact in his abundant correspondence, notably with Mendelssohn or with his family. It thus seems to me established beyond doubt that Lessing, although not its author, is responsible for the publication of the Schreiben eines Juden an einen Philosophen nebst derAntwort, the first call for equal rights for Jews in Germany. This hitherto unknown fact of Lessing's biography is a new jewel to be added to the already glorious crown of Lessing the Wise. It is also clear that the author of the Schreiben is to be sought in the circle around Lessing. Taking into considera- tion our earlier conclusion that the author was Jewish, the number of possible sus- pects suddenly becomes astonishingly small. In fact, it shrinks to one. In the early and mid-1750s, Lessing had two Jewish friends: Aaron Salomon Gumpertz and Moses Mendelssohn. Various considerations establish unquestion- ably that Mendelssohn was not the author of the Schreiben. First, he met Lessing (through Gumpertz) only in 1754, and thus after the Schreiben had already ap- peared (Lessing reviewed it in August 1753). Second, in 1753, Mendelssohn's Ger- man was not yet good enough to compose the Schreiben by himself; and if we assume that someone revised it, as Lessing was to do in 1755 with the Philosophi- sche Gesprdche, then we would presumably have had echoes of this in Mendels- sohn's correspondence.68 Third, Mendelssohn became famous already during his 65.

VI. AARON SALOMON GUMPERTZ Aaron Salomon Gumpertz, also called Aaron ben Zalman Emmerich, was born in Berlin on December 10, 1723, to a very wealthy family of Hofjuden, one of the few allowed to dwell in the city permanently.72 His great-grandmother was 69. In his introduction, written in 1782, to the German translation of Menasseh ben Israel's Vin- diciae Judaeorum (1656) (see on this enterprise: Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 463 -74) Mendelssohn briefly touches on arguments practically identical with those of the Schreiben, yet without mentioning it. See: Moses Mendelssohn, "Vorrede" [to Menasse Ben Israel, Rettung der Juden]," in JubA, vol. 8: Schriften zum Judentum II, ed. Alexander Altmann, 1-25, esp. on 11-13 [ = Schriften zur Philosophie, Aesthetik undApologetik, ed. Moriz Brasch, 2 vols. (Leipzig, 1880), 2:473-500, on 484-89], sum- marized in Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 468. Nor does the Schreiben appear in the list of books found in his house after his death: Verzeichnif3 der auserlesenen Biichersammlung des seeligen Herrn Moses Mendelssohn (Berlin, 1786). It thus seems that he probably was not at all acquainted with the Schreiben. (It should yet be remembered that Mendelssohn never mentioned in writing the short-lived periodical Qohelet Musar which he himself produced.) I will suggest below why the Schreiben was so little no- ticed by contemporaries. 70. See Mendelssohn's letter to Leopold Freiherr von Hirschen, dated October 18, 1785, in: Moses Mendelssohn 's gesammelte Schriften, 5:640; quoted in Bruer, Geschichte der Juden in Preuflen, 63-64; Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 463. 71.

Moses of Zamosc (1700-1772), the well-known scientifically minded Talmud scholar who had ar- rived in Berlin shortly before." Israel Zamosc taught Gumpertz medieval Jewish philosophy as well as mathematics and astronomy (using mainly standard medieval Hebrew texts).76 Gumpertz greatly appreciated his teacher, describing him as a "supernal help" sent to him by God to "enlighten [his] eyes."77 Gumpertz's life- thal, "New Light on the Physician Aaron Salomon Gumpertz: Medicine, Science and Early Haskalah in Berlin," Zutot 3 (2003): 59-70. 73.

In view of the claim to be made below for Gumpertz's authorship, it is interesting to note that Israel Zamosc was particularly knowledgeable in the Kuzari on which he composed a famous com- mentary (Ozar nehmad, printed posthumously in 1796). It is known that Moses Mendelssohn, also a student of his, copied portions of it, probably still in the period in which he and Gumpertz studied with Israel Zamosc. (Mendelssohn at first copied the commentary on the margins of the Buxtorf edition [Basel, 1660] of the Kuzari and later on sheets inserted in the book. The manuscript was separated into several parts of which two are known to survive: New York, Jewish Theological Seminary Mic. 2520 and Warsaw, Jewish Historical Institute 1215 [Jerusalem, Institute for Microfilmed Hebrew Manu- scripts, Nos. 28773 and 10113 [also 31022], respectively].) 77.

In his letter to Gottsched of March 8, 1745 Gumpertz uses a similar expression: he says that his interest in the sciences and the liberal arts "bekam allererst vor drey Jahren ein Licht; und fand den Steg der zu seinem Endzweck leitet"; see Danzel, Gottsched und seine Zeit, 333 (reprinted in: Landshuth, "Dr. Aron Gumpertz," 331).

In March 1745, still moved by a desire to deepen his knowl- edge, now especially in German literature, Gumpertz addressed himself to Johann Christoph Gottsched in Leipzig, the most brilliant and influential man of German letters of the time, asking him to be taken in as his student.8' Although Gottsched replied favorably, nothing came out of the plan, because the outbreak of the Sec- ond Silesian War (1745-1746) made it impossible for a Jew from Prussia to ob- tain from the royal court of Saxony the indispensable special permit to dwell in Leipzig. Gumpertz instead studied Latin, and perhaps other subjects as well, at the Joachimsthaler Gymnasium, to which he was introduced (soon to be joined by the young Moses Mendelssohn)82 by Louis Isaac de Beausobre (1730-1783), the son of the great Huguenot preacher Isaac de Beausobre (1659-1738) and future ad- viser of Frederick II and member of the Academie. At about the same period, Gumpertz became a secretary to the Marquis d'Argens: he saw him almost daily and became a regular participant in the discussion groups at the latter's home.83 By 1745, the twenty-two-year old Gumpertz was already famous within the Jewish community for his multifaceted intellectual competence. The community charged him with the preparation of the Jewish calendar, a privilege that it held un- der the auspices of the Acadcmie, and Gumpertz fulfilled this role from 1745 to tin, 1828), 373. Echoes of Gumpertz's acquaintance with Zamosc may also be found in his reference to heliocentric astronomy as "New Heavens" (the title of a treatise Zamosc planned on that subject) and in his allusion to the persecution of scholars studying the sciences, even the mathematical ones in which there is "no danger whatsoever"; see Sefer megaleh sod, Preface, unpaginated [ii recto] and second He- brew numbering 13b. 78. "He [Gumpertz] never refuses his instruction, as I know from my own experience. To him alone I owe everything I have acquired in the sciences," Mendelssohn told his bride.

David Fraenkel (1707-1762), the new rabbi of the Berlin community,85 composed a Hebrew poem and a solemn ser- mon, and the task of preparing German translations of both, to be read to the king and his entourage, was entrusted to Gumpertz.86 The latter, Freudenthal com- ments, "was certainly the only individual in the entire community to be capable of doing it," and the translation itself confirms that he "mastered German skillful- ly."87 In fact, most Jews in Berlin had not yet acquainted themselves with high Ger- man and the leadership of the Berlin Jewish community systematically suppressed such knowledge.88 Tellingly, in 1746, a fourteen-year-old friend of Mendelssohn 84.

Gumpertz's translation into high German of the poem was subsequently turned into the Berlin Judeo-German written in Hebrew characters and published in a separate brochure, which was already extremely rare in the ninteenth century. [A copy is at the Amsterdam University Library (call number: Br. Ros. 132-7). I am very much indebted to Mr. Jan Vellekoop of the Leiden University Li- brary for having brought it to my attention and to Dr. Emile Schrijver of the Menasseh ben Israel In- stitute at the University ofAmstrdam for having sent me a scan picture of it.] This version was reprinted in L. Landshuth, Toldot anshei ha-shem u-peculatam ba-'adat Berlin (Berlin, [5]644 [1884]), 40-48. Landshut believed this version in Judeo-German to be the only one printed, but H. Pick, "Aron Salomon Gumpertz als Ubersetzer patriotischer Gelegenheitsschriften," Zeitschriftfiir hebraische Bibliographie 14 (1910): 183-85 announced the discovery of two brochures, in high German and in German char- acters, carrying Fraenkel's sermon and the poem. (These copies, then held at what is now the Staats- bibliothek Preul3ischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin, were both destroyed during WWII. I recently discovered another copy of the sermon, which I intend to describe elesewhere.) Interestingly, the translation of the poem was done by Gumpertz alone, but that of the sermon he made together with a certain Lazarus Nehemias, described as a Schutzjude and as "learned"; see Pick, "Aron Salomon Gumpertz als Ober- setzer."

In addition to the mathe- matical sciences, especially astronomy, he was attracted in particular to anatomy, which he began to study bookishly in his father's vast library. Eventually, Gumpertz decided to study medicine, with a view to acquiring a profession. In all likelihood, he studied for some years in Berlin at the Collegium medico-chirurgicum and then registered for a short while at the Faculty of Medicine in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, where he received his M.D. on March 19, 1751, after having defended his thesis entitled De Temperamentis.90 It is noteworthy that his opponent in the defense was Louis de Beausobre, already encountered above, who was soon to become mem- ber of the Acadimie des sciences (on February 27, 1755).91 About this time, Gumpertz, who never practiced medicine, became the secretary of Maupertuis, the Acadimie's president, to whom he dedicated his doctoral thesis; Gumpertz held this post until late 1751 when he set on a Bildungsreise.92 During these years, Gumpertz developed a broad network of social con- tacts-both in the milieu of the Prussian intellectual establishment around Fred- erick II, and among the rising young intellectual elite. Both networks are the facets of a newly emerging public sphere and sociability, in which the game of chess played an important social function.93 To his social network belonged also Chris- 89. This little known anecdote is revealing for life in Berlin in the middle of the eighteenth cen- tury and deserves to be quoted in full: "Ein ehrenwerther, noch lebender Mann [footnote: Herr S. Bleich- rider in Berlin] teilt uns mit, daB sein Vater ihm folgendes aus seinem Leben erzihlt habe: 'ich kam im Jahre 1746 als armer 14 jhriger Knabe nach Berlin und fand Moses Mendelssohn in der Lehranstalt fir den Talmud. Dieser gewann mich lieb, unterrichtete mich im Lesen und schreiben und theilte oft mit mir sein kiimmerliches Brodt. Aus Dankbarkeit war ich dem Mendelssohn durch kleine Dien- stleistungen behiilflich, und so schickte er mich unter anderm irgend wohin, um ein deutsches Buch zu holen. Mit diesem Buche in der Hand begegnete mir ein jiidischer Armenverweser, der mich mit den Worten anfuhr: was hast du da? wohl gar ein deutsches Buch! Sogleich riB er mir das Buch aus der Hand und schleppte mich zum Vogt, dem er den Befehl gab, mich aus der Stadt zu weisen.

Dur- ing his years in Berlin, Kies was Ordinary Member of the Berlin Acadcmie (fol- Times, ed. Michael A.

The Montagclub was founded in 1749, and for many years, it was headed by Friedrich Nico- lai (1733-1811). For various periods it was attended by Lessing (as from 1752), the poet Karl Wilhelm Ramler (1725-1798), and the philosophers Johann Georg Sulzer (1720-1779) and Thomas Abbt (1738-1766). This learned society established itself as a center of the early Enlightenment. The Swiss philosopher Sulzer seems to have had particularly close contacts with Gumpertz (Freudenthal, "Ahron Emmerich-Gumpertz" in Kaufmann and Freudenthal, Die Familie Gompertz, 196). In 1747, he was professor of mathematics at the Joachimsthaler Gymnasium at which Gumpertz studied (or had stud- ied), and in 1750, he was appointed to the Academie des sciences. Moses Mendelssohn was not a mem- ber of this society; see Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 76. 98. The Kaffeehausgesellschaft, an informal learned society devoted specifically to the discus- sion of the natural sciences, was founded in 1756, apparently by Johann Georg Miichler (1724-1819), a close friend of both Lessing and Mendelssohn. On him and on the society, see JubA, vol. 11: Briefwechsel I, ed. Bruno Strauss and Alexander Altmann, notes, 397, 402-3; and Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 74-75.

In the latter capacity, he was in charge of the annual preparation of the Berlin Calendar until his departure from Berlin.'1' Owing to his own work (since 1745) on the Jewish calendar under the auspices of the Academie, Gumpertz was certainly in continuous contact with Kies. Lessing, for his part, was introduced to Kies by Mylius in about 1748.102 A few months after having obtained his medical degree, Gumpertz set out on the traditional Bildungsreise abroad.103 Parts of this journey can be recon- structed from external sources. On Thursday, October 24, 1751, we find him in London, attending a meeting of the Royal Society, to which he had "leave to be present" by Emanuel Mendes da Costa (1717-1791; Fellow of the Royal Society since 1747, one of the most knowledgeable conchologists and mineralogists of the time).104 It seems likely that Gumpertz's connection to da Costa was facilitated by virtue of the fact that the latter was a Sephardi Jew. In the following months, da Costa brought Gumpertz with him to a number of meetings of the Royal Society and apparently also introduced him to other Fellows, both Jewish (Jacob Sarmen- to de Castro [1692-1762])105 and non-Jewish (Henry Baker [1698-1774)], Sir Dr. John Pringle [1707-1782], James Short [1710-1768]),106 who in their turn also brought Gumpertz along with them to several meetings.107 In one of the notes to his revised edition of L6secke's medical treatise to be described later, Gumpertz in 101.

Writing to da Costa from Paris on October 27, 1753, Gumpertz refers to Short as "our dear friend," thereby suggesting that the contact between himself and Short was established through da Cos- ta. In his letter to Euler, too, Gumpertz describes Short as his "true friend" (wahrer Freund), suggest- ing a close relationship (Lausch, "A.S. Gumpertz und die Academie royale des sciences," 16). 107. Gumpertz thus attended the following meetings of the Royal Society under following pa- tronages: 10-24-1752 (da Costa; JB 20 [1748-1751], 543); 12-5-1751 (da Costa; JB 21 [1751-1754], 1); 1-9-1752 (da Costa; ibid., 12); 1-16-1752 (da Costa; ibid., 22); 1-23-1752 (de Castro; ibid., 29); 2-13-1752 (Baker; ibid., 41); 5-14-1752 (de Costa; ibid., 133); 6-4-1752 (Pringle; ibid., 151); 6-11- 1752 (Short; ibid., 157). 326</page><page sequence="29">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) 1758 referred to a "bezoar-stone" the size of a chicken egg that he donated to his friend "Herr Mendez d'Acosta" in London, who included it in his "famous col- lection of minerals."108 Gumpertz clearly was well connected in London scientif- ic circles, for in May 1752, he served as an intermediary between Newtonian members of the Royal Society and the mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707- 1783), then in Berlin.109 Through da Costa Gumpertz also met Peter Collinson (1693/94-1768), the well-known natural historian (below, n. 115). Concerning the next chapter of Gumpertz's life, we have some information from a letter he addressed to da Costa from Paris on October 27, 1752.110 We learn that after having left England, he slowly traveled through the Low Countries on his way to France ("I rambled about, not unlike the everlasting Jew").1" He visited Dunkirk, Brugges, Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, and Mechelen, but found them rather dull ("there is nothing to be seen for a Curious Eye .... [M]any good na- tured People, but hardly one man that thinks of what is worth admiration above his head [i.e., no one interested in astronomy, Gumpertz's own discipline], nor what amazing Productions are hiden [sic] in the Bowels of the earth [i.e., no one inter- ested in mineralogy, da Costa's field]; in short, there is no such thing as usefull [sic] Learning in vogue."). "Other Dutch Towns," which he considered as "paint- ed Beauties," notably Rotterdam, The Hague, and Leiden, he found to "contain a little more, especially Leyde, where by and by I had the honour to wait upon Mr Prof. [David Jerome] Gaubius [1704 or 1705-1780], whom I gave your Compli- ments and receiv'd his ones for You." Gumpertz arrived in Paris in mid-October 1752, and he was still there in late April of the following year.'12 Here, too, he set out to establish a network of sci- entific connections, notably with persons for whom he had letters of introduction 108. Loesecke, Abhandlung, 215, note i; quoted from Freudenthal, "New Light on the Physi- cian Aaron Salomon Gumpertz," 75. 109. Lausch, "A.S. Gumpertz und die Acadimie royale des sciences." Gumpertz writes to Euler that he persuaded his "good friend" James Short not to read before the Royal Society his criticism of Euler before he, Euler, could have time to reply to cricism levelled aginst him by Dollond (ibid., 15). This is in keeping with what we learn from the Journal Book of the Royal Society (vol. 21 [1751-1754]: 102), whose entry for April 9, 1752, reads: "A letter from Mr. Short FRS to Petere Davall SRS [Secre- tary of the Royal Society] dated Surry Street 9th April 1752 was read.... This letter Mr Short desired to deposit with the Society, till Mr Euler has had a sufficient time to answer another letter which Mr Dolland has written to him, at Mr Short's desire, shewing the mistake, and desiring to know Mr Euler's reasons for that Hypothesis. Whereupon Mr Dolland's letter to Mr Short was locked up among the So- ciety's Papers by Mr Dovall one of the Secretaries." Gumpertz did not attend that meeting, but da Cos- ta did. The letters were subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions 48 (1753-1754): 289-91. 110. London, British Library, Add MSS 28537, fol. 436. Summarized in Ruderman, Jewish En- lightenment in an English Key, 211-12. On the top of the letter another hand, obviously da Costa's, not- ed: "N.B. I did not answer it." 111. Gumpertz probably left England in June or July 1752, for in his letter to Euler he writes on May 26, 1752, that he intends to leave for France "shortly" (bald; Lausch, "A.S. Gumpertz und die Academie royale des sciences," 16) and in October he was already in Paris after a long journey through the Low Countries. 112. "It's now a fortnight since I am here in the Parisian air," he wrote to da Costa on 10-27- 1752. See also Appendix II below. 327</page><page sequence="30">Gad Freudenthal from da Costa: he mentions Ren&amp;-Antoine Ferchault de Reamur (1683-1757),113 Dr. Ant6nio Ribeiro Sanches (1699-1783),114 and Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier (1717-1799),115 but presumably there were more of whom we have no informa- tion. Despite these connections, there was no question of reiterating the experience in London and attending meetings of the Acad6mie royale des sciences, of course.116 In Paris, Gumpertz also met with Gualtherus (Wouter) van Doeveren (1730-1783), then a student of medicine and science at the University of Leiden, who was soon to receive his medical degree and later became a Dutch medical au- thority."7 For reasons that will become clear later, it seems likely that in May or June 1753, Gumpertz returned to Berlin, where he spent the following years. During this period, Gumpertz collaborated closely with Mendelssohn and Lessing.1"8 When Die Juden appeared in print for the first time in 1754 (in the fourth part of Lessing's Schrifften), the influential G6ttingen theologian and orientalist Johann David Michaelis (1717-1791) published a scathing review in his periodical Got- tingischeAnzeigen von Gelehrten Sachen (GGA).119 His main complaint, ground- ed in his own aesthetic theory, was that the plot was altogether "improbable" (a characteristic Gottschedian category), namely because the hero was described as a noble-hearted and generous Jew, a character not existing in reality; as a result, he urged, the play could not arouse compassion in the public and was therefore of 113. "Your Letters, Sir, for Mr De Reamur I have not yet delivered as these Gentleman [sic] come not out of the Countrie in town before St Martin's Day," he writes to da Costa. 114. "My Direction may be to Dr. Sanchez ru? d'Orleans St. Honor6." In all likelihood Gumpertz was recommended to Ribeiro Sanches by Gaubius, who knew him well; see: S. W. Hamers- Van Duynen, ed., Gaubius (1705-1780): Ziin Correspondentie metAntonio Nunes Ribeiro Sanches en Andere Tijdgenoten (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1978). On Ribeiro Sanches see: Georges Dulac, "Science et poltique: Les r6seaux du Dr Ant6nio Ribeiro Sanches," Cahiers du monde russe 43, nos. 2-3 (April-Sept. 2002): 251-74. Ribeiro Sanches indeed lived at that address in 1752. I am indebted to Georges Dulac and Michael Silber for their advice on Ribeiro Sanches. 115. "I have not yet spoken with Mr Le Monier [sic], as soon as I see him I shall give his [da Costa's] Compliments to him, just as he [da Costa] ordered me." Gumpertz continues: "Meanwhile he [da Costa] may lay his Commands [for minerals and other specimen] upon me &amp; depend upon to be waited on. Likewise to Mr Collinson." Gumpertz clearly undertook to supply da Costa and Collinson with samples of minerals and plants. 116. The Acad6mie royale des sciences was a state-funded body whose very limited member- ship included professional scientists only. The records for the meetings of 1752 and 1753 show that no nonmembers attended them as guests. See Paris, Academie des sciences, Procis verbaux, Vol. 71 (1752) and vol. 72 (1753). 117. See Appendix II below. 118. The following episode is described in Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 40-43. 119.

Lessing prepared his riposte in accord with his two Jew- ish friends, Mendelssohn and Gumpertz.'20 The three decided on a rejoinder to Michaelis-to be published in Lessing's Theatralische Bibliothek-that would consist of three texts: (i) a short response by Lessing himself; (ii) a letter from Mendelssohn to Gumpertz "complaining" about Michaelis' review; (iii) Gum- pertz's reply to Mendelssohn. The fact that the personae of these two Jews exist- ed in reality would thus palpably refute Michaelis' allegations that a noble Jewish character was "improbable." Mendelssohn dutifully sent his letter to Gumpertz, who composed a reply and then forwarded both texts to Lessing. Lessing, howev- er, found that Gumpertz's letter to be too vehement and decided against its publi- cation. The published response to Michaelis thus consisted only of Lessing's and Mendelssohn's pieces.121 Lessing introduced Mendelssohn's letter, written in late June 1754, with the following words: I would, however, rather let another speak whom this matter touches to the heart, one of this very nation. I know him too well to deny here the testimonial that he is a man as spirited as honest. He wrote the following letter in response to the G6ttingen review to a friend among his nation [viz. Gumpertz] whose good qualities equal his. I anticipate a reluctance to believe this and an inclination to assume that this letter is a fiction of my own, but I am prepared to convince irrefutably anyone who is concerned about its authenticity. Here it is.122 Mendelssohn's letter appeared anonymously: neither his name nor that of the ad- dressee, Gumpertz, were mentioned by Lessing. During the mid and late 1750s, Gumpertz devised many literary plans, in- cluding one for a periodical: some of the planned publications were to be in He- brew, for an intended Jewish audience, others in German, for an intended German learned public.123 Yet, very little came out of these projects. In 1758 Gumpertz published a much-expanded edition of a popular medical treatise by Johann Lud- wig Leberecht Ldsecke (1724-1757), which testifies to his up-to-date medical competence.124 In 1761 he moved to Hamburg (where a part of his family resided 120. Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 41. Mendelssohn's letter, to be discussed presently, is clear- ly not written as a private document, but rather as one intended to be read by a large public. 121. Lessing's response and Mendelssohn's letter are reprinted in Lessing, Werke 1743-1750, ed. Stenzel, 489-97. Mendelssohn's letter alone is reprinted in Mendelssohn, JubA vol. 11: Briefivech- sel I, 9-13, with notes on 387-89; it is partly translated and partly summarized in Altmann, Moses Mendelssohn, 41-42.

This slim volume contains, in addition to an introduction, which amounts to a brief intellec- tual autobiography, a super-commentary on Abraham Ibn Ezra's commentary on the Five Scrolls, and the short Ma 'amar ha-mada' (A Treatise on Knowledge).127 The latter is an overview of the subjects studied in the different branches of con- temporary science, which was written in lieu of the comprehensive overview of all branches of the sciences that Gumpertz had intended to write in Hebrew, but was now too weak to do so.128 A true Kampfschrift,129 it urges Jews to study "secular wisdom," which it seeks to legitimize by arguing that it is compatible with a fi- delity to Judaism.'30 Gumpertz seems to have published this work, a small frac- tion of his writings, in haste, feeling that death was close.131 During his final years, his disease made him constantly ill-tempered: "Ein Mensch ohne Lunge kan schwehrlich libreich sein," Mendelssohn pointedly observed. He became isolated and even detested, a circumstance that possibly contributed to his having fallen into oblivion rapidly after his death at the age of forty-five (on April 10, 1769).132 VII.

It remains to be seen whether we can positively connect him with the anonymous pamphlet. Although I cannot produce a manuscript of the Schreiben in Gumpertz's handwriting, I think there is overwhelming circumstan- tial evidence substantiating the thesis that he is the author. A first, weighty, consideration is the simple fact that in 1753 Berlin, there was simply no other Jew besides Gumpertz capable of producing a work like the Schreiben. In fact, because Gumpertz was the only Jewish intellectual in Berlin in 1753 to be integrated into non-Jewish society, the inference that he is the author of the Schreiben would have been warranted, even if our search was not limited to the circle around Lessing. A crucial aspect is the mastery of high German. We saw that Gumpertz learned high German as a child and that his letters to Gottsched as well his translation of R. Fraenkel's poem and sermon attest to the fact that he mas- tered literary German beautifully.133 As already noted, although in mid-eighteenth century Berlin and Prussia, some Jews already spoke German, especially for the purpose of trade, Gumpertz was the only Jewish intellectual in Berlin at the time who really mastered the language-Mendelssohn having acquired a mastery of German only three or four years later. The fact, then, that in 1753 there was no Jew- ish intellectual socialized in German letters other than Gumpertz strongly points to him as the author of the Schreiben. This thesis is corroborated by related considerations. The translations from French to German of press reports related to the Jew Bill, included in the Schreiben (see Appendix I), demonstrate that the author mastered not only German but also French, precisely one of the two foreign languages Gumpertz knew particularly well.134 A related aspect is the familiarity with contemporary thought. The Schrei- ben displays a good acquaintance with the then-current discussions in economic theory. Gumpertz was at home in circles around the Acadcmie and the court and was the only Jew in Berlin at the time who could be credited with such notions.135 Lessing indirectly confirms the assessment that a Jew with intellectual qual- ities such as Gumpertz's was unique at the time. In his preface to Mendelssohn's "scandalized" reaction to Michaelis' criticism of Die Juden, he anticipates on the part of his readers "an inclination to assume that this letter is a fiction of [his] own." Lessing obviously perceived that the idea that two Jews could exchange letters in perfect high German would appear as dubious to his readers. He was even more outspoken in his private letter to Michaelis, which accompanied the issue of The- atralische Bibliothek containing his rejoinder. There he deems it necessary to make 133. See also Appendix II. 134. In the autobiographical account given in his first letter to Gottsched, Gumpertz mentions French as the first foreign language he studied (see also Megaleh sod, Preface, unpaginated [i recto]). Friedrich Nicolai in his obituary of Mendelssohn writes that French and English were the foreign lan- guages that Gumpertz knew particularly well (in Moses Mendelssohn, JubA, vol. 23, Dokumente, II, 13). 135. The Schreiben's precise intellectual background in economic theory remains to be stud- ied. In particular, the possibility that Gumpertz met Isaac de Pinto (above, n. 16) in Holland, London, or Paris (places in which both sojourned in the roughly the same periods) and became acquainted with his ideas prior to their publication should be explored. 331</page><page sequence="34">Gad Freudenthal clear: "Er ist wirklich ein Jude," thereby showing that such an idea appeared as rather implausible at that time.136 Consider now Gumpertz's roles in society. As one of the very few contem- porary Jews to have received a German education, and as the first and for a num- ber of years the only Jew in Berlin to be in touch with non-Jewish intellectuals and statesmen, Gumpertz had one foot in the Jewish culture and community and an- other in German letters and Berlin society. Gumpertz constantly sought to bring these two social roles together. His letter to Gottsched on March 8, 1745, provides a valuable insight into how he viewed himself and Jews generally in their relation to the non-Jewish society. While he explicitly writes to Gottsched as a Jew, he also invokes two other identities: he speaks of "we Germans" (wir Deutsche) and also says of himself that he is a "member of the society of men" (Mitglied der men- schlichen Gesellschaft).137 The very same duplicity of identities characterizes the author of the Schreiben. To begin with, we recall that it refers to "German Jews" (verschiedene der Deutschen Juden) who freed themselves from misery and igno- rance. The expressions "German Jews" and (coming from a Jew) "we Germans" were both unheard of at the time and remained so for a long time. Here we appar- ently have their very first occurrences: the great similarity of these two singular expressions clearly points to one author who so viewed himself and his brethren. By the same token, the expression "member of the society of men," used by Gumpertz to capture his self-perception, is almost identical to the expression "cit- izen of the terrestrial globe" (ein Mitbiirger des Erdkreises), used by the author of the Schreiben to describe the philosopher's posture, a similarity that again desig- nates one and the same author. Gumpertz, let me now observe, was aware that his simultaneous participa- tion in Jewish and German societies would not be welcomed by most members of both. Thus, his only Hebrew publication makes no allusion to his involvement in German cultural life, while his two works addressed to the non-Jewish public (his doctoral dissertation in Latin and the revision of Ldsecke's medical treatise in German) make no reference to his Jewish identity. Specifically and strikingly, al- though we have straightforward positive evidence that Gumpertz had strong feel- ings about the Jews' situation in Prussia-Lessing, we recall, judged Gumpertz's rejoinder to Michaelis to be unpublishable because it was written with too much temper-there is no trace of these feelings in his Hebrew work Megaleh sod, not even where the context seems to call for it, namely in the discussion of the Scroll 136.

This explains why Gumpertz chose to publish the Schreiben, his only public intervention on behalf of his brethren, anonymously-as was to be his letter on the same topic to Lessing-and why there is no allusion to it in his Hebrew work. It is instructive to note that Gumpertz seems to have harbored a deep-seated desire to resolve conflicts, to assume the social role of a go-between mediating be- tween conflicting parties. In 1747, he proposed to step in as a "Mittler" (interme- diary) between Gottsched with his then patron, the Marquis d'Argens (who in his Lettres juives had criticized German literature)-precisely the role he also as- sumed when he attempted to mediate between Euler and his English critics. This role fits the task undertaken by the author of the Schreiben, who sought precisely to be an "intermediary," reconciling the Jewish and the Christian societies. Also, the viewpoint from which the Schreiben was written bears the mark of Gumpertz's role in society. The philosopher is construed not only as the author of a forthcoming treatise in political science, but also as a close adviser of the king. Levi Israel challenges his fictional correspondent with the following words: "As- sume the position of a Le Fort; perhaps also a Peter the Great will be found" (13).139 We recall that Gumpertz had among his friends not a few close advisers of King Frederick II-notably the Marquis d'Argens, Louis Isaac de Beausobre, and Cothenius: they and their like were the model for conceiving the philosopher's literary figure. At the same time, they were also the readers Gumpertz had in mind when he composed the Schreiben. He believed that a strong will on the part of the enlightened monarch, who would be guided by a no less enlightened and strong- willed adviser, could instantly improve the Jews' situation in Prussia. The call to the prince's counselor was arguably the most operational sentence in the Schreiben; Lessing apparently appreciated this and quoted it in full in his review.140 Another consideration is related to the anonymous character of the publica- tion. We saw that Lessing had a predilection for such publications and was con- sidered by authors as an expert in the art of publishing books anonymously. But Gumpertz, too, had a penchant for this kind of affectation: when he wrote to Gottsched in 1747, he sent him his Schreiben an Doris, asking him to publish it, but anonymously.141 Gumpertz and Lessing must thus have found in one another 138. It does not seem farfetched to surmise that Gumpertz's letter was along the lines of the re- proach which the philosopher of the Schreiben put in the mouth of the Jews: "You evil Christians: stop persecuting us! ... Can you demand that we love a religion that ostensibly instructs you [Christians] to hate us? ... Reject our [religious] errors, but not our persons!" (18-19). 139. The text adds a reference to a prince who would "unite the strongest mind with the great- est power," a remark that, as already noted, was obviously tailored to flatter King Frederick II. 140. Lessing, Werke 1743-1750, ed. Stenzel, 523:36-524:14; note that where Gumpertz wrote "meine Nation" (13) Lessing, deliberately or not, quoted "eine" (524:5). 141. "I obediently request to keep my insignificant name secret, for I never wished to glimmer through learning, much less through writings of this kind."

When he writes that he did not wish to glim- mer "through writings of this kind" Gumpertz probably refers to satirical writings for polemical purposes. 333</page><page sequence="36">Gad Freudenthal kindred spirits and must have been happy to collaborate on an anonymous publi- cation. We may note in passing the similarity of the two titles: Schreiben an Doris and Schreiben eines Juden. Secrecy is also in keeping with what we know of Gumpertz's character: Mendelssohn, we recall, acknowledged that he owed to Gumpertz alone all he knew in the sciences and that Gumpertz was a great teacher; we know nothing of this from any other source, least of all from Gumpertz him- self. This clearly shows that Gumpertz was a man who chose to work behind the scenes, unrecognized. Circumstantial evidence, too, links Gumpertz to the Schreiben. The English Jew Bill aroused little public attention in Germany. Toury discovered only two dis- cussions of the bill in the German press.142 The source of information on which the author of the Schreiben drew is indeed foreign. The Anhang to the Schreiben (25-32), which reproduces extracts from the press reports on which the author re- lies, indicates their origin as "French Leiden newspapers" (Franzosische Leiden- sche Zeitungen). I have been able to identify these as the Nouvelles extraordinaires de divers endroits, better known under the name Gazette de Leyde.143 This French language newspaper, which was to have its heyday in the time of the American Revolution, was founded in 1677 in Leiden by a Protestant French refugee and car- ried political, military, and diplomatic news from all Europe, especially London and Paris. Since 1735, it was in the hands of the Luzac family, also of French Protestant origin. Between 1738 and 1772, it was written and edited by Etienne Luzac (1706-1787) and published by his older brother Jean (1702-1783).144 The Gazette de Leyde was read mainly in France, and so the fact that the German-writ- ing author of the Schreiben derived from it his knowledge of the Jew Bill is note- worthy. We will now see that the fact that the author of the Schreiben used the improbable Gazette de Leyde again points to Gumpertz. It seems certain that Gumpertz saw the issues of the Gazette de Leyde car- rying the first reports about the upcoming English Jew Bill in Paris.145 Now, 142.

Quite interestingly, one who was well informed of these events in Germany is none other than Johann David Michaelis, who referred to them in the course of his criticism of Lessing's Die Juden: "wir haben in unsern Gedancken dieses LeBingsche Lust-Spiel aus Deutschland nach England hiniiber gebracht, wo im vorigen Jahre eine Com6die von der Art n6thig gewesen seyn k6nnte, um das Volck von seinem ausschweifenden HaB gegen die Juden und von seiner Widersetzung gegen die Juden-Acte zuriick zu bringen.

Although the Spanish and Portuguese synangogues in London began "lobbying" for a change in the naturalization laws as early as 1746, the first moves toward what was to be the Jew Bill of 1753 were made only in January 1753, and the formal presentation of the bill in the House of Lords was made only on April 3, 1753 (Perry, Public Opinion, 17, 19, 22). Because Gumpertz was in Paris since mid-October 1752, it was there that the information concerning the bill reached him. 334</page><page sequence="37">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) not only was the Gazette de Leyde much read in Paris in general, but there existed a personal link between Gumpertz and the Gazette in the person of van Doeveren, who studied in Leiden and was soon to return there and whom Gumpertz met, prob- ably not for the first time, on April 27, 1753 (see Appendix II). Presumably, how- ever, this was not Gumpertz's first encounter with the Gazette. Etienne Luzac's nephew was Eilie Luzacfils (1723-1796), also a publisher in Leiden, and he was the publisher chosen by the energetic Perpetual Secretary of the Acadcmie, Jean Henri Samuel Formey (1711-1797) for the Bibliotheque impartiale, a short- lived (1750-1758) bimonthly carrying news from the Republic of Letters.146 Elie Luzac and Formey corresponded intensively during the years of their col- laboration, and their letters show that the Luzacs were in constant contact with the milieu of the Berlin Academie, leading members of which were also of French Protestant origin.147 We recall that Gumpertz was in constant touch with the Acadcmie as early as 1745 and remained so as long as he remained in Ber- lin.'48 Specifically, Elie Luzac was in contact with Maupertuis, two of whose books he published in 1750-51-the very same period that Gumpertz was his secretary.149 Last but certainly not least, the publisher Elie Luzac was repre- sented in Germany by no other than Christian Friedrich Vo1, Lessing's publish- er, friend, and even neighbor.150 Now Elie Luzac himself tells us that "the only newspaper I read is that of my uncle," that is, the Gazette de Leyde, and this ob- viously makes him an ideal conduit for passing the Gazette to his correspondents in Berlin.'151 It seems certain, then, that Gumpertz saw the first reports of the Jew Bill in April while in Paris. It is not impossible that he remained in Paris during the fol- lowing two months, wrote the Schreiben there, and forwarded it to Lessing by the post. It seems more likely, however, that he soon returned to Berlin and produced the Schreiben there in concert with Lessing: as we saw, he could easily continue to 146.

The relationships between VoW's and Elie Luzac's publishing houses may be an interesting subject for further research, but the following can already be noticed: in October 1748, La Mettrie, a favorite of Frederick II, apparently interceded in favor of VoB when he applied for a privilege allowing him to settle in Berlin (Buchholtz, Die Vossische Zeitung, 35); between 1748 and 1752, Vo.3 published some ofLa Mettrie's works, including L'Homme machine, a controversial work whose first edition had been published (anonymously) by Ilie Luzac (causing him much trouble). 151.

In any event, both in Paris and in Berlin, a direct line of communica- tion connected Gumpertz to the Gazette de Leyde, making him into the man to draw from it the information on the Jew Bill. A further, tiny, but very telling, confirmation that Gumpertz indeed is the author of the Schreiben is the idiosyncratic use of the acronym "N.B.," which we find both in the Schreiben and in one of Gumpertz's letters. We noted earlier that the second part of the philosopher's footnote is preceded by the abbreviation "N.B." (notabene), which, in fact, is used to stand for "P.S." (postscriptum). In a letter that Gumpertz addressed to da Costa from Hamburg on May 8, 1767, he recommend- ed to his old friend "the carryer [sic] of this present," whose qualities he describes, but without naming him.152 As an afterthought he added below his signature: "N.B. The name of the Gentleman is Doctor Kleteker."153 Here, too, "N.B." is used in lieu of"P.S." This is highly peculiar: in contemporary correspondence, addenda to a letter were systematically signaled either by "PS." or (in German) by "N.S." (sometimes: Nachschrift).154 A perusal of Lessing's entire active and passive cor- respondence, for example, showed that "P.S." or "N.S." were used methodically, and that on the few occasions on which "N.B." was employed, it was not confused with the other abbreviations.'55 The singular (in fact: erroneous) usage of "N.B." instead of"P.S." that we have identified in the two writings is thus a personal idio- syncrasy, which is all the more striking as the two texts are in two different lan- guages. This rare lapsus calami can be likened to fingerprints, a sort of personal characteristic "signature," which strongly corroborates that both texts were writ- ten by the same person. VIII. CONCLUSION In the preceding pages I have sought to establish that the Schreiben was com- posed by Aaron Salomon Gumpertz and was published with the active assistance of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. While I think that there can be no doubt that this is the overall picture, I now wish to introduce a nuance. As noticed above, the Schreiben seems to contain a clear echo of Shake- speare's The Merchant of Venice. Seeing that in the early 1750s Shakespeare was 152.

A check in major German libraries showed that Dr. Kleteker (or Kletteker) published no book; nor does his name appear in the Deutscher Biographischer Index (Munich, 1986). 154. I am grateful to Didier Kahn (CNRS, Paris) and to Antony McKenna (University of Saint- Etienne) for their advice on this point. 155. Lessing, Werke und Briefe, vols. 1 1(1-2)-12, Briefe von und an Lessing 1743-1770, ed. Helmuth Kiesel, et al.,: in the 1,627 letters, there are eighteen occurrences of"P.S.," 22 of"N.S.," and seven of"Nachschrift." There are two occurrences of"N.B." at the end of letters (11[2]:415; 12:262), but they seem to be properly used, i.e., they do not stand for "P.S." or "N.W." Another occurrence (11[2]:26) is in a letter without signature and clear ending. 336</page><page sequence="39">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) barely known in the German cultural area and that Lessing was one of the very few who were familiar with his writings, I suggested that the Schreiben's "Shake- spearean" phrase was inspired (or even written) by Lessing.156 It seems likely that the Schreiben was written by Gumpertz after he discussed its contents with Lessing or perhaps showed him a first draft: the Schreiben's form as a series of pro- posals, anticipated objections, and answers may reflect their discussions. More- over, we know that Gumpertz occasionally showed Lessing his manuscripts, and it is thus not impossible that Lessing added a phrase or two to Gumpertz's text.157 This reconstruction is in keeping with what we know of Lessing's role in bringing to print Mendelssohn's writings. What seems very likely, in any event, is that Less- ing had some influence on the contents of the Schreiben. The Schreiben may bear yet another mark of Lessing's intervention. We ob- served that the philosopher's epistle contains a curious discontinuity in the argu- mentation. The philosopher describes "great and countless" obstacles on the way to the improvement of the situation of the Jews (21-23). Apparently overwhelmed, he concludes that the Christian citizens of any European nation all share the conviction (printed in bold characters) that "it is impossible to bring subjects of both the Chris- tian and the Jewish religion simultaneously to prosperity" (23). This sentence, in fact, flatly thrusts aside the entire argument put forward by Levi Israel, as does the next one, which opens a new paragraph: "Let us, honorable friend, content ourselves with the hope that the Jews will eventually make themselves better mannered (gesit- teter), so that they will be less hated by the Christians and will ultimately obtain the right to citizenship (das Biirger-Recht) in all counties. This however will require many years and centuries" (23; emphasis mine). The following sentence, however, totally reverses this dark pessimism: "But I go too far with my doubts. The happiness of the Jewish people requires only a single instant (Augenblick), in which a monarch will have the noble desire to be the fulfillment ( Wollust) of humankind. .. ." and will decide to prevail over the heritage of superstition (23-24). This decidedly optimistic sentence, which concludes the philosopher's letter, expresses a sudden change of mind. It can hardly have been written in one stroke with the preceding text, and it seems to me to testify to a revision of a first version. The optimistic conclusion can of course be due to a sudden insight on Gumpertz's part that a positive tone at the end of his pamphlet would be pedagogically more constructive. But the sudden and total reversal may very well be a result of a spur from someone else, who would then be Lessing, the Schreiben's first reader and its publisher: Lessing may either have encouraged Gumpertz to change the end or have done this himself. Lessing himself, then, may be giving us a hint concerning his involvement in producing the Schreiben. At the very end of his rejoinder to Michaelis, intro- 156.

In the second of these letters, Mendelssohn asks Lessing whether one of Gumpertz's manuscripts was in his hands. 337</page><page sequence="40">Gad Freudenthal ducing Mendelssohn's (anonymous) letter, Lessing writes (June 1754): "I antic- ipate a reluctance to believe this [i.e., that the following letter has been addressed by one Jew to another] and an inclination to assume that this letter is a fiction of my own, but I am prepared to convince irrefutably anyone who is concerned about its authenticity" (emphasis mine). This could well be an instance of a hat burning on the thief's head: having indeed taken part in fabricating and in pub- lishing a fictitious correspondence between an unreal Jew and an unreal philoso- pher less than a year earlier, Lessing now anticipates in his readers precisely this suspicion. Lessing's involvement in producing the Schreiben may contain the clue to the riddle of the initials R.C.D.N. with which the philosopher signs his letter. At this stage of our inquiry no one (I trust) will anymore expect these letters to be the initials of a real person. Indeed, Toury already raised the possibility that the four letters are an acronym, although he was at a loss to suggest a reasonable solu- tion.158 I put forward the following possibility: Rechtschaffner Christ Deutscher Nation. The adjective "rechtschaffner" (righteous) appears in Lessing's writings in similar contexts: in Die Juden (Scene 2) the expression "rechtschaffne Christen" occurs, and in his rejoinder to Michaelis the adjective "rechtschaffner," now ap- plied to Jews, appears four times.'59 Indeed the word "rechtschaffner" perfectly captures the philosopher's entire endeavor. Although in the Schreiben the philoso- pher of course does not speak qua Christian, it yet seems apposite to refer to him as a Christian philosopher inasmuch as the entire confrontation is construed as be- ing between Jews and Christians. Similarly, the Jews are referred to as a "Nation," so that referring to the philosopher as belonging to the correlative "German na- tion" seems appropriate too.160 To be sure, this is not an irrefutable solution, but it seems to me to be a plausible suggestion. Last, we should ask why the Schreiben has had so little effect on posterity.161 That it (as also Lessing's Die Juden, published the same year) left little impression on the contemporary German public is quite understandable: it was a premature precursor of Dohm's writing; the times were not yet ripe for a public discussion of Jewish civil rights. In fact, it ran head-on against Frederick the Great's policy: the General Regulation of 1750 was unfavorable to the Jews, aiming in particular to reduce the Jews' role in trade, and in 1752, the king banned Jewish entrepreneurs from the silk market.'62 This policy was just the opposite of that which the Schreiben sought to promote. Further, the position of the Schreiben was of course 158. Toury, "Eine vergessene Friihschrift," 262, n. 30. Toury suspected the acronym to refer to a Latin proverb. 159. Lessing, Werke 1743-1750, ed. Stenzel, 490:27 (rechtschaffner und edler Jude; similarly 491:1); 492:1; 492:19 (referring to Mendelssohn). 160. Thus the qualification "of the German nation" would be the exact parallel to the name "Levi Israel" according to the interpretation suggested above. On the contemporary meaning of the term "Nation" see the note in Lessing, Werke 1743-1750, ed. Stenzel, 1157. 161. We already noted that even Mendelssohn was not acquainted with it. Nor was Dohm; see Och, Imago judaica, 12. 162. Hubert C. Johnson, Frederick the Great and His Officials (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975), 92. 338</page><page sequence="41">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) considerably weakened by the fact that the English Jew Bill, to which the Schreiben devoted an entire appendix, was repealed before the end of the year. Indeed, even the protagonists themselves, Gumpertz and Lessing, did not mention the Schreiben in their later writings. Lessing, we noted, warmly reviewed the Schreiben immediately on its publication, never to mention it again. The rea- son for this is quite clear: the Schreiben's main thrust, the economic-mercantilist arguments in favor of according the Jews citizen rights, followed a different path from Lessing's own, humanistic, way of thinking and arguing. Further, in the ear- ly 1750s Lessing was involved in numerous publication initiatives, so that for him the Schreiben presumably was a minor affair. Lessing thus saw no reason to mention the Schreiben later in life, so much so, indeed, that, as we saw, even Mendelssohn was unaware of its existence. As for Gumpertz, he was a rather se- cretive person who above all shunned publicity: his very autobiographical account (in Hebrew) leaves out important aspects of his life, such as the fact that he ob- tained an M.D. from a German university, was involved in the gentile intellectual life in Berlin, and even published a medical treatise in German. There is no won- der, therefore, that he did not mention the Schreiben anywhere, not even to Mendelssohn. The 1753 Schreiben is thus a document that acquires its consid- erable importance only from historical hindsight: because we know the sequel, and the end too, of the Jews' integration to German society, we appreciate its fore- sight, or at least its audacity. Now, I submit, we also know who should be credited with it.* Gad Freudenthal Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Villejuif, France * Acknowledgments: Research for this study was done at the Herzog-August Bibliothek (HAB), Wolfenbiittel, at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem, and at the library of the Royal Society in London.

The source for these reports, of which long quotations are given in the Anhang to the Schreiben, is given as the "the French Leiden newspapers" (Franz6sische Lei- densche Zeitungen), which I have identified as the Nouvelles extraordinaires de divers endroits, commonly known under the name Gazette de Leyde. To sub- stantiate this identification, and also to show how the author, Gumpertz, used the information at his disposal, I compare below the pertinent reports concerning the Jew Bill carried by the Gazette de Leyde with the reports quoted in the Schreiben .'164 The comparison shows Gumpertz to have been a careful, precise, and competent translator of highly technical (juridical) texts. But it also shows that Gumpertz acted tendentiously, namely by deleting information he considered as potentially damaging to the cause he defended: he abridged reports by omitting in- formation concerning the opposition to the bill, and some such reports he did not translate at all. To facilitate the comparison, I give the texts in parallel columns: in the left column I reproduce all the reports concerning the Jew Bill published by the Gazette de Leyde from the first (dated April 6) to the report dated June 29, 1753 (which probably appeared when the Schreiben was already completed and which Gum- pertz did not translate).165 On the right, I give the corresponding translations by Gumpertz. The untranslated reports or parts of reports are made visible by being underlined. All texts are reproduced unaltered, with italics and bold characters as in the respective originals.

For one reason or another, copies of the Gazette de Leyde for 1753 are very rare. I am most grateful to Professor Anne-Marie Mercier-Faivre and Madame Pascale Ferrand, of the Centre d'Itude du XVIIIe Siecle in Lyons (UMR 5611 of the CNRS and Universit6 de Lyon 2), for kindly having sup- plied me with a CD-ROM carrying the entire year (made from a copy at the Bibliotheque royale Albert Ier in Luxembourg, call-number: III 38645 A). 164. The reports in the Gazette are exhaustive and objective, as is shown by their comparison with the account given in Katz, Jews in the History ofEngland. The match is so close that Katz's book can serve as a guide to the identification of the sources on which the Gazette drew. 165. Noteworthy is the long report carried by the Gazette de Leyde no. 59, dated Tuesday, July 24, 1753 (7-8; Suppl.).

I recently discovered a further short text in Gumpertz's own hand, namely an inscription he made on April 27, 1753, in the Album amicorum of Gualtherus (Wouter) van Doeveren (1730-1783), preserved at the Dutch Royal Library in The Hague (call number 78 J 1, fol. 57v).183 Van Doeveren studied medicine in Leiden from 1747, then for a while in Paris, and received his M.D. on his return to Leiden in October 1753.184 The in- scriptions (mostly in Latin) in the young van Doeveren's Album straddle the years 1750 to 1754.185 For the most part, van Doeveren's acquaintances were physicians or priests, with the most noted personality to write an inscription being (as far as I can tell) the famous physicist Petrus van Musschenbroek (1692-1761), one of van Doeveren's teachers, given at Leiden on June 26, 1752 (fol. 45r). The greater part of the inscriptions were written at Leiden, but about twenty of them were writ- ten during van Doeveren's sojourn in Paris, showing that it lasted from late Sep- tember 1752 to June 1753. One of the Paris inscriptions is by Gumpertz, who describes himself as van Doeveren's "true friend and sincere admirer." The text of the inscription is given in extenso below. It consists of a main text in German, and-added in the margin-a few lines in Latin, French, and Hebrew. 183. According to the catalogue description (forthcoming), van Doeveren's Album amicorum carries ninety-five inscriptions; it measures 113x 185 mm, is in paper, and contains III+ 160 fols., of which 95 are blank. 184.

From 1754 to 1771, van Doeveren was professor of medicine at the University of Groningen, there- after at the University of Leiden. 185.

Gelber and Gedaliah Elkoshi (writing in the au- thoritative Encyclopaedia hebraica), affirmed that a small booklet with the title: Schreiben eines Juden, Levi Israel Samosch an einen Philosophen nebst Antwort (Berlin, 1753), resulted from a discussion that took place between Israel b. Moses of Zamosc (1700-1772) and the publisher Friedrich Nicolai (1733-1811), Men- delssohn's and Lessing's friend.190 Toury noted that this title is not strictly identi- cal with that of the Schreiben as he knew it from the second (1759) printing, and regarded this attribution with disbelief.191 Inasmuch as neither Gelber nor Elkoshi provide a reference substantiating their assertion, Toury could not check it, and instead adduced a number of reasons that led him to think that this was a mis- attribution. To his compelling arguments, the following, possibly strongest, can be 187. Horace, Arspoetica, 139. (Gumpertz inadvertently wrote "nascitur" instead of"nascetur.") This aphorism has been reworked in La Fontaine's "La montagne qui accouche." I am indebted to Jose Chabais for his help with this line. 188. Seeing that the two lines in French appear between two quotations, it seemed natural to in- quire whether they are not a citation as well. Here is the unflattering comment of Didier Kahn (CNRS, Paris), to whom I am grateful for his advice: "ce ne sont que des vers de mirliton, avec des fautes grossieres de versification, ce qui me parait exclure qu'il puisse s'agir d'une citation." 189.

On Israel Zamosc see the refer- ences given above (n. 75). 350</page><page sequence="53">Gumpertz, Lessing, and Civil Rights of Jews in Germany (1753) added. Friedrich Nicolai himself wrote a short notice on Israel b. Moses of Zamosc, whom he must have met in person, presumably though Lessing or Mendelssohn. In this notice, he explicitly states that the Hebrew scholar, whom he admired, knew no German: "Israel Zamosc verstand keine Sprache, als Hebriisch," he wrote.'92 Nor does Nicolai allude to any "controversy" or discussion between himself and Israel Zamosc. It is thus excluded that Israel Zamosc conducted any kind of ex- change with Nicolai or composed the Schreiben. While there can be little doubt that Israel of Zamosc has nothing to do with the Schreiben, it is not without interest to ask how the misattribution came into ex- istence. Its origin is traceable to the article "Haskalah in Zamosc" (in Yiddish), published by historian Jacob Shatzky (1893-1956) in YIVO Bleter in 1952. In the course of the overview it offers of the Haskalah in Zamosc, Shatzky naturally dis- cussed Israel of Zamosc, albeit rather briefly. Among other things, Shatzky wrote: In 1740 he left [the town of Zamosc] for Berlin, where he met with the young Haskalah movement, was Mendelssohn's teacher, befriended Lessing and the philosopher Nicolai. ... With Nicolai he even conducted a public controver- sy in German, a language which, like many East-European autodidacts, he learnt by himself. This controversy is the only thing this maskil published in German; the language in which he wrote [otherwise] was Hebrew.'93 These statements were accompanied by the following footnote: Schreiben eines Juden, Levi Israel (Samosch), an einen Philosophen nebstAntwort, Berlin, 1753. There can be no doubt that Gelber relied on Shatzky's article: his main re- search interest was the cultural history of Jews in Poland, and he was thus certain- ly acquainted with Shatzky's paper. Note that Shatzky put the name "Samosch" in parentheses, thereby indicating that it was added by him, but that Gelber dropped them.'94 Elkoshi, in his turn, derived his information from Gelber, whose article appears in his bibliography. (Elkoshi indeed gives the title exactly as Gelber did, and not in Shatzky's version.) One riddle is thus solved: we know where Gelber and Elkoshi found their er- roneous information. This, however, leaves us with another enigma: on what basis did Shatzky make his claim, for which he naturally gave no substantiating refer- ence? The chain of reasoning and inferences that led him to his literary invention can be reconstructed as follows. As has just been noted, Friedrich Nicolai men- tioned Israel b. Moses of Zamosc in one of his annotations to the Mendelssohn- 192. Friedrich Nicolai, "Anmerkungen zu Moses Mendelssohn's Briefwechsel mit Gotthold Ephraim Lessing," in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Sdmtliche Schriften, 29 (Berlin and Stettin, 1828), 373; republished in Moses Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 5 (Leipzig, 1844), 205. Most cu- riously, Gelber (n. 190), referred to this precise passage to substantiate the claim that Israel Zamosc knew Nicolai. 193. "Haskalah in Zamosc," YIVO Bleter 36 (1952): 24-63, on 24; the article was republished in Pinkas Zamosc [Yiddish and Hebrew] (Buenos Aires, 5717-1957), 185-220. 194. Jacob Dov Mandelboim, the author of an admirable bibliography of the works of the Jews of Zamosc, reproduces the title as given by Shatzky; see his "Hakhmey Zamosc," in Pinqas Zamosc, 221-316, on 271. 351</page><page sequence="54">Gad Freudenthal Lessing correspondence. This fact was reported in numerous standard biographical accounts of Israel of Zamosc written by Jewish literary historians, who prided them- selves in it.195 Thus, the fact that Friedrich Nicolai was acquainted with Israel of Zamosc was well known, and Shatzky was certainly aware of it. Now Shatzky must have been acquainted also with Eichstidt's Bibliographie zur Geschichte der Juden- frage of 1938, the bibliography that revealed the existence of the Schreiben to histo- rians: this is established beyond doubt by the fact that in the title of the Schreiben as he gives it, the Jewish writer is named "Levi Israel," a piece of information Shatzky could have obtained nowhere else. (Shatzky obviously never saw any copy of the Schreiben itself.) Israel of Zamosc was also known as "Segal" (acronym of segan leviyah, i.e., officer of the Temple Levites), and thus as belonging to the large family of the Levis. Shatzky, who knew that Israel of Zamosc was in Berlin as from 1741, quickly concluded that "Levi Israel"-the name of the Jew of the Schreiben eines Juden as given by Eichstidt-must be none other than Israel Segal/Levi of Zamosc. Perhaps he was also misled by Graetz, who referred to Israel as "Israel Levi Zamosc."196 From here it was easy to identify the philosopher who responded to "Levi Israel" as Friedrich Nicolai, Israel of Zamosc's acquaintance, a step Shatzky was quick to make, concluding that the Schreiben grew out of a public controversy between Israel b. Moses of Zamosc and the well-known Friedrich Nicolai. (Shatzky is indeed known to have been a little hasty at times and a similar confusion was made by Johannes Dominicus.)197 Either because he wrote from memory, or because he wanted to better establish his case, Shatzky complemented the title that he found in Eichstidt's bibliography with the name of the Jewish author as he identified him, obtaining Schreiben eines Juden, Levi Israel (Samosch) an einen Philosophen nebst Antwort. Unsurprisingly, he could give no reference substantiating the existence of a publication by that name, still less an indication of its contents. Occasionally, though, errors are productive of knowledge. For whatever it may be worth, I note that I first learned of the existence of the Schreiben from Gel- 195. The first to report this fact correctly seems to have been S. Stanislavsky, "Israel Zamosc: A Biographical Essay" [Russian], Voschod 6 (1886): 131-37, on 134, followed by Israel Zinberg: A History ofJewish Literature, vol. 6: The German-Polish Cultural Center, trans. and ed. Bernard Mar- tin (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College and New York: Ktav, 1975), 244, n. 17. Shatzky, who in 1949, edited a collection of Zinberg's articles, was certainly familiar with this standard work, which first ap- peared in Yiddish in 1929-37. It should be mentioned that earlier Jewish historiographers had wrong- ly believed that it was Lessing who highly appreciated Israel Zamosc, no doubt because Nicolai's remark was first published in Lessing's Sdimtliche Schriften. See: Israel Baer Lewinsohn, Zerubbabvel [1st ed. 1863] (Warsaw, 1901), 68: "The wise Lessing (in his letters) mentions him [Israel b. Moses of Zamosc] with much respect and praise and says of him that he was learned and accomplished in the mathematical sciences"; Samuel Joseph Fuenn, Knesseth Yisrael (Warsaw, 1886), 690-92, on 690: "his name became known even among the greatest Christian scholars in Berlin, and the greatest of their scholars, Lessing, says of him in one of his letters that he was learned and accomplished in the math- ematical sciences" (Fuenn indicated Zerubbavel as his source); the popular Simon Moses Chanes, Toldot ha-posqim (Warsaw, 1911), 453 copies this passage. 196.

Following the trail, I ended up identifying the true author as one of Zamosc's former students: Aaron Salomon Gumpertz, the first "German Jew." 353</page></plain_text>
