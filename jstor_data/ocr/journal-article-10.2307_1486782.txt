London: Frank Cass, 1996. 222 pp. Normalization came to be regarded as both a political objective and a problem for the foreign relations of Israel and West Germany. Both countries were established on partitioned territory-a Jewish state sharing the geography of Palestine with the Arab state of Jordan, and a divided Germany reflecting Cold War polarities. However much the circumstances of the wars that produced these countries differed, their borders shared one significant quality: both were drawn in conflict. For both countries, therefore, the conditions of their founding were bound to suggest a less than stable political future. Aiming at the reunification of the two Germanies, the Federal Republic's leaders insisted that conquest and Soviet protection afforded no legitimacy to East Germany. Denouncing the East German regime as tyrannical, West German politicians harnessed their own willingness to provide international support and foreign aid to countries agreeing to adhere to the Hallstein doctrine of isolating East Germany. The Arab countries of the Middle East were similarly inclined to isolate Israel as a pariah state and to threaten sanctions against countries and corporations that extended military and economic assistance. But as George Lavy's examination of West German-Israeli foreign rela- tions indicates in its very title, the leaders of postwar West Germany could not construct a Middle East policy without a consciousness of the past. If West Germany wished to become a significant power in the newly formed Western alliance of nations in the context of the Cold War, the country had to acknowledge the crimes committed by Nazism against the Jewish people. The memory of World War II and of its atrocities was fresh, and the chilling story of the destruction of European Jewish culture informed all aspects of West Germany's Middle East policy. A consensus developed in West Germany supportive of Israel's claim that the Jewish state had a right to receive financial compensation, known as restitution, for Nazism's destruction of Jewish civilization. Moreover, Konrad Adenauer and David Ben-Gurion, each a founding father of his respective country, anticipated that this claim would include a perpetual German obligation to sustain the survival of a Jewish state. To honor this obligation, however, often appeared to damage West Germany's national interest, which depended on sound and dense economic relations with the Arab world. Constructing a foreign policy that heeded moral and prudential standards raised all sorts of problems for the Federal</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 423 Republic of Germany and for Israel, themes which George Lavy chronicles in Germany and Israel. The book, a revision of Lavy's doctoral dissertation, skillfully summarizes the many policy dilemmas confronting governments in Israel and West Germany as political leaders sought to normalize their foreign relations and their positions in an abnormally configured world. The extension of German economic and military aid to Israel always provoked an adverse reaction from the Arab states, which ultimately led many to accord diplomatic recognition to East Germany as a measure of their disdain for West Germany's assumption of responsibility for Israel's existence. While the actual relations between West Germany and Israel were always framed as a tension between morality and national interest, the issues were much more complex than their presentation suggests. Lavy's work hints at, but does not fully probe, the complex context of international relations in which such issues were considered. Israel's initial reluctance to establish normal relations with West Germany was counterbalanced by a recognition that "if Israel was to avoid the danger of isolation by establishing close relations with western Europe, both France and the Federal Republic would occupy key positions in this relationship" (p. 5). Similarly, as Cold War rivalries diminished, "While there was continuing sympathy for Israel [in Germany], there was also increasing impatience with the role of the eternal penitent whose atonement must continue indefinitely" (p. 163). This is not to suggest that Lavy lacks appreciation for the multilayered nature of foreign relations, but rather that he chooses to focus on how German morality intersected the country's national interest. Relying heavily upon newspaper accounts provides some insight into the public's perceptions of these various policy dilemmas, but it does not adequately prepare the ground for a deeper investigation. And while Lavy's detailed discussions of particular crises are thorough, given the published record, they do not resolve the ambiguities inherent in the two central analytic concepts he deploys: morality and national interest are never really defined. Thus students of Israeli politics interested in understanding the Jewish state's relations with Germany ought to consult this book as a useful first reference but only as a bridge to further serious sustained inquiry.
