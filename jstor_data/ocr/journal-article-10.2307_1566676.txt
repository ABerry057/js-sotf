<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 159 Kevin MacDonald. Separation and Its Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory ofAnti-Semitism. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 1998. x, 325 pp. Milton Shain. Antisemitism. Bowerdean Briefings. London: Bowerdean Publishing Co., 1998. 124 pp. Imagine two citadels of research on antisemitism standing side by side, each dedicated to turning out a product quite the opposite of what the other produces. Each works efficiently for a constituency that waits eagerly for what comes off the academic line. The sign above one school reads "Rationalization and Apologia: Jewish Clannishness and Cultural Separatism," while the sign above the other suggests "Religious, Racial and Political Antisemitism." To confuse matters, imagine that each institution uses similar references and texts in well-known contexts in the history of Jewish persecution. In contributing to our understanding of the longest hatred in Western civilization, both academies use more or less the same descriptive labels, so why are the conclusions so different? Is Judenhetzen anti-Semitism or antisemitism (since there is no such thing as "Semitism")? Are anthropological theology (e.g., Israel as God's son [Exod 4:22]), chosen people doctrine, etc.) then, and Jewish accomplishments now, contributing factors to the distinction or extinction of the Jews? To what extent is Jewish ethnic memory- arguably different from other group memories--conducive to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about itself? Some want to talk history, others theology. Some are fashioned by the hands of Esau (national consciousness and self-determination in the European tradition),while others dance to Pan's lyre (church fathers and councils) or to David's harp (Bible and rabbinic tradition). Still others want to focus on the phenomenon of antisemitism in categories of race, nation, and colonialism in modem times. Consider the word "Jew" used so frequently in discussions and depiction of Jewishness, the religion, culture, and peoplehood, yet the battle over its meaning has been as intense as any debate of "why the Jews?" in the history of hatred. In Separation and Its Discontents, a volume intended to penetrate the multi- leveled, centuries-laden and ubiquitous problem of Jew hatred, MacDonald surveys which antisemitic strain best explains the ideology and practice of antisemitism. His chapters, informed by contemporary social psychology, present an evolutionary theory of antisemitism fueled, on the one hand, by the need of Jews to preserve their identity</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS by voluntary segregation from the larger society and, on the other, by religious supersessionism (Christian and Muslim), economic competition, and other conflicts. The first part scrutinizes the ups and downs of Jewish-gentile relations in the ancient world and in the first Christian centuries, and it suggests that stereotypes result from positive evaluations of the in-group and negative evaluations of the out- group. The middle section examines texts and themes of pivotal moments associated with Western antisemitic movements. It contributes fresh thinking on the Jews as a powerless minority in the Late Roman Empire (4d Christian cent.), the limpieza laws during the Iberian inquisitions, and the fateful anti-Jewish legislation of the Nazi party. Finally, in the last chapters, the author returns to his introductory theme and argues that Jewish historiography dictates theories of antisemitism that are self-promotional, by promoting group aggrandizement of biblical proportions, and self-deceptive, by ignoring or rationalizing criticism from outside. Case in point: the tribal-racialist memories of Israel's early experiences. The superiority of Ha-Shem over the gods of other nations developed in response to the continual persecution that threatened to eliminate Jewish group solidarity. MacDonald works from the assumption that the dual Torah is the blueprint of the eventual Jewish dominion over the world. Such a view of early Jewish history portrays the Maccabees as heinous tyrants, the Pharisees as clannish, nationalists as separatists, the Romans as innocent, and Babylonian Jewry as responsible for unleashing the pretense for antisemitism that henceforth was to blot the pages of Western civilization. Similarly, the Jews in our time. Evil against the Jews-that is to say, the paramount effect of antisemitism, the Shoah, and threats to the sovereignty of the State of Israel-is provoked by the Jews themselves. In this scenario, Jews imagine themselves as innocent victims of hatred and violence. The author comments that religious and secular Jews alike see themselves as a small, weak, good group dispersed among a large, strong, bad group (the nations of the world) that consistently and persistently victimizes them. Also, the Jewish people considers itself blameless when others suffer from Jewish action or inaction (e.g., Zionist actions in Palestine created a stateless people, but many Israelis and Jews cite the Palestinians as the cause and see nothing hypocritical or irrational in this). Though MacDonald may be seen as a scholar provocateur ("This is ... first and foremost a book that confidently predicts its own irrelevance to those about whom it is</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 161 written"), his point is that criticism of Jews and their ways might be harsh or not polite but it is within the protected sphere of legitimate research and speech. Nonetheless, a rambling who-is-who-isn't roundup of Jews responsible for the "Jewish problem" borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation. No one who writes on antisemitism can be accused of tackling a simple issue or one limited in scope. To be sure, words on the subject are not in short supply. We pay attention to these words, however, in fits and starts, depending on which area of antisemitism intrigues us. Shain's brief account on the subject written for the nonspecialist is an excellent introduction to the complex nature of antisemitism. Shain brings freshness to the study of antisemitism, both the old and the new. His well-structured chapters on religious anti-Judaism, racial antisemitism, political anti-Zionism, and post-Shoah antisemitism compel the reader to rethink accepted clich6s. Antisemitism on its own terms, cultivated from primary and secondary sources, is an important leitmotif throughout the volume. The important lesson taught is that no single teaching or text is going to turn an entire society into a Nazi Germany or bring a second Shoah. But if such a development were to recur, it would be the result of discourse and ideology contributing to an historical imagination that revels in revilement and persecution. Commendably, the author, using reader-friendly language composed in a staccato manner and captivating imagery, brings home the point that realization of antisemitism and its vision of apocalypse is ever present and therefore necessitates constant vigil. MacDonald's book is written from a statistician's perspective, whereas Shain's is written from a learner's perspective. MacDonald's book will well serve research students in antisemitism; Shain's will be of value for those who are interested in a survey of antisemitism. MacDonald's book exposes hidden agendas interpreted in controversial commentary, and Shain shows correctly how "history has constructed the Jew" and molded antisemitism. Though both books are recommended, Shain's Antisemitism is the place to start, particularly for the general reader. Zev Garber Los Angeles Valley College Van Nuys, California</page></plain_text>
