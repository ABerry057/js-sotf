New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001. xii, 324 pp. Unlike the Sephardim, who accepted the concept of taqiyya and the practice of marranism to cope with forced conversions under Islam, the Ashkenazim, es- pecially the Jewish communities of Germanophone Central Europe, developed an uncompromising rejection of Christian baptism. Instead of marranism and decep- tion under Islam, the Ashkenazim, in the persecutions of the Crusades and after, developed a strong sense of martyrdom and detested baptism, whether forced or voluntary, as ritual and spiritual defilement and pollution. The small number of Jewish converts to Christianity were not so much sinners but apostates (meshum- madim or the vertilgten). Given this Ashkenazi tradition, it is not surprising that converts were marginalized in Jewish historiography and scholarship. Neverthe- less, as Carlebach argues persuasively in this book, they played a significant role in Jewish-Christian relations in early modern Germany; and given the fact that conversions rose rapidly in the late eighteenth century, it is all the more important to understand the prehistory of Jewish conversion and integration in Germany af- ter Emancipation. Carlebach's study is based on an exhaustive analysis of the autobiographical writings of converts in German-speaking lands between 1500 and 1750. Before she embarks on a thorough examination of these texts, Carlebach provides a help- ful framework in the first two chapters, in which she contrasts the notion of con- version in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities and briefly discusses the negative images of the convert in the medieval confrontation between ecclesia and synagoga. Chapter 3 focuses on the sixteenth century as a turning point in con- version and offers incisive analysis of the writings of the three major converts: Vic- 388</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews tor von Carbon, Johannes Pfefferkorn, and Anton Margaritha. Chapter 4 follows the chronological unfolding and tells the story of the Sabbatai Zvi movement and the impact of failed messianism on conversion in the Holy Roman Empire. The next six chapters (5- 10) form the heart of the book and represent Car- lebach's original contribution. Based on a careful reading of conversion autobi- ographies, anti-Jewish writings, and Christian Hebraica, Carlebach presents the major themes of this book: the divided self of the convert, as revealed in autobi- ographies, with the permanent tension between the Jewish and Christian selves; the professions of the converts, who tended to be recruited from second-ranking religious positions in the Jewish communities and whose prospects for social ad- vancement after baptism remained bleak throughout the early modern period; an especially good analysis of the family rupture occasioned by conversion, especially in disputes over child custody and child baptism; a short discussion of language and identity; the examination of the contributions converts made in their writings on Jewish rituals; and lastly, the rivalry between Jewish converts and Christian He- braists. The final chapter looks at the convert in the age of Enlightenment, when fewer obstacles stood in the way of social integration. The nature of Carlebach's sources helps to determine the shape of the analy- sis. The self-referential nature of convert writings, the high-degree of inter- textuality (Margaritha's Der Gantz Jiidisch Glaub, 1530 was cited into the late eighteenth century by both converts and Christian Hebraists, for example), and the ahistorical character of exempla citations in the writings all make for a rich and nuanced textual analysis. Particularly impressive in this regard is Carlebach's sen- sitive reading of the issues of language, identity, and the larger interplay between the residual Jewish self and the new identity striven after in convert writings. The combination of Christian prejudice toward Jewish converts and the need felt by the latter to bridge their two communities implied that the convert could never escape his Jewish identity during the early modern period. While self-referential sources privilege the interpretation of self and text, they can sometimes provide informa- tion on the real lives of converts. In her discussion of family rupture, for example, Carlebach skillfully draws on other courses to contextualize the cases of family dispute, but the social picture remains rather sketchy, a shortcoming that could have been compensated for if judicial sources in city archives had also been used. All in all, within the declared goals of Divided Souls, Carlebach has given the reader an insightful and sensitive interpretation of the writings by converts in early modern Germany. She has further contextualized this reading within the larger milieu of Jewish-Christian relations. This is an impressive intellectual achievement that leaves the reader wishing to know more about the social world of the convert. R.
