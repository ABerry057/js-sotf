<plain_text><page sequence="1">Martin S. Jaffee. Torah in the Mouth: Writing and Oral Tradition in Palestinian Ju- daism, 200 BCE-400 CE. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. xi, 239 pp. In recent decades, an array of scholars has investigated the oral and written (re)creation and transmission of early Jewish and Rabbinic tradition. Martin S. Jaf- fee stands at the forefront of this field of research, devoting much of his recent scholarly effort to the topic. In a series of journal articles and chapters in edited volumes over the past ten years, Jaffee has offered diverse insights from a variety of research forays into the literary traits of early Judaism. Torah in the Mouth is Jaffee's initial monograph on the subject, in which he builds extensively and im- pressively on his prior work, augmenting it in breadth, depth, and theoretical so- phistication. The work is divided into two parts. The first consists of three chapters, each devoted to a distinctive Palestinian Jewish social group of the Second Temple pe- riod (in order: scribes; the Yahad; and the Pharisees). Through his selection and analysis of the appropriate literary evidence for each group, Jaffee discerns a range of intriguing facets of the oral-literary, oral-performative and text-interpretive el- ements of Second Temple Jewish literary circles. For example, Jaffee argues that a primary characteristic of Second Temple scribal literacy was its exclusive privi- leging of only the oral, "original" dictation of a textual tradition to a scribe. Sub- 327</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews sequent, oral presentations of the same text were accorded no ideological signifi- cance. Concerning the Yahad, Jaffee proposes that the community endowed its mu- tually oral and written text-interpretive process with prophetic authority. Particularly meritorious is Jaffee's precise refutation of scholarly attempts to dis- cern clear lines of continuity between the text-interpretive tradition of Pharisaism (about which we know virtually nothing), and the text-interpretive tradition pre- served in early Rabbinic literature. Taken as a whole, the first part of the book serves to introduce Jaffee's over- arching theoretical claim in the monograph, namely, that Second Temple Judaism lacked "any articulate ideological formations of oral-literary tradition as a dis- tinctive Judaic cultural possession" (p. 11). Or, stated differently, Second Temple Judaism did not possess an ideologically distinct conceptualization or privileged construction of an "oral tradition" that was perceived to be intrinsically distinct from its written textual tradition. Again, in Jaffee's words, "Second Temple Ju- daism ... was virtually innocent of self-consciousness regarding the orality of tra- dition. Oral tradition existed, but it wasn't much thought about" (p. 7). The second part of the book consists of four chapters and an epilogue. Jaf- fee follows the same pattern as in the first, advancing his overarching theoretical proposal introduced in Part One through the simultaneous exploration of various, discrete aspects of early Rabbinic textuality in each chapter. Jaffee proposes that, in contrast to Second Temple Judaism, it was the Amoraim who developed for the first time an ideological conception of a distinct corpus of "oral" tradition. They did so by shifting the consciousness of orality from the text (as described in the first three chapters) to the rabbinic tradition of interpreting and performing the text (as described in the final four chapters). Thus, Rabbinism did not create ex nihilo the notion or content of Jewish oral tradition. Rather, the early rabbis inherited an indeterminate mass of tradition from the spectrum of Second Temple Judaism, adapted it to suit their needs, and ulti- mately buttressed these adaptations by bestowing upon them an oral provenance ". .. that as a matter of ideological principle, came to deny that the written sources of its oral-performative tradition exist" (p. 12). By the time of the early Amoraim, rabbis are not only thinking about their oral tradition, but also privileging it through the construction of the elaborate myth of its purported pristine, oral transmission from Sinai to the present-"Torah in the Mouth." In the final chapter of the work, Jaffee offers an explanation about not only why early Rabbinism created such an ideological understanding of its oral-literary, performative, and interpretive tradition, but also how it was applied to its daily religious endeavors. Jaffee inquires why the Amoraim based their pedagogical sys- tem upon this ideology to the extent that Rabbinic tradition was regarded as valid- ly engaged and transmitted only by means of oral processes, detached from written sources-even when faced with an entirely different reality. It is clear that written sources were utilized for all aspects of Rabbinic learning; nonetheless, the Amoraim consistently privileged and promoted only the oral, spontaneous, en- gagement of tradition. Drawing from models of Greco-Roman and early Christian rhetorical edu- cation, Jaffee argues that the impetus for the development and application of the 328</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews ideology of "Torah in the Mouth" comes from the master-disciple relationship that served as the foundation of Amoraic pedagogy. Rabbinic sages formed close, personal, and intimate relationships with their disciples, believing that revelation could only be accessed in this way. For these sages, "Torah in the Mouth" was an ongoing process, linked not to words on the parchment page, but, rather, to the em- bodiment of the sages' lives, actions, and words. Talmud torah-the engagement and activation of the revelatory power of "Torah in the Mouth"-was not an op- tion to the disciple who encountered tradition from the written text in isolation. Rather, it was realized in the encounter between sage and student involving the spontaneous, declaimed performance of tradition. In Jaffee's own words: "[The Amoraim] link[ed] the idea of Torah in the Mouth firmly to the pedagogical reali- ty of discipleship training. They elevated to a new level the primacy of the Sage as mediator of a transforming body of knowledge in which his own presence was the principal mode of mediation" (p. 152). It should be noted that, at times, the dense mass of ideas in the final four chapters sometimes obfuscates the linear development of Jaffee's overarching ar- gument, making it somewhat difficult to discern. Jaffee's diverse ideas, valuable as they may be, do distract somewhat from the overall continuity of his argument. Incorporating and augmenting over a decade of thought into a single effort clear- ly is not an easy endeavor. Nonetheless, cohesion exists for the industrious reader, and Jaffee's overarching argument is both forwarded and supported throughout the monograph. Moreover, the price is worth paying. Jaffee's insights are unique, daring and challenging, and are certain to engender much rigorous scholarly debate. Particu- larly noteworthy in this respect is Chapter Four, wherein Jaffee advocates an inno- vative understanding of the term halakhah, routinely conveyed as "law." Jaffee proposes that the term be understood more precisely as " . .. an orally transmitted report concerned with normative behavior in a particular sphere of activity" (p. 75). Halakhah refers not simply to legal tradition, but to " ... tradition subject to change and fluctuation in its specific implementation ... because it is ground- ed in the personal authority of human beings" (p. 82). The academy awaits eager- ly the rigorous deliberation that ideas such as this are certain to promote. As mentioned above, Torah in the Mouth is the culmination of Jaffee's grad- ual, persistent consideration of the oral and written literary processes of early Ju- daism. As such, it is presently one of the most articulate, disciplined, and precise monographs on this subject to appear in quite some time. It is also a testimony to the value of a measured agenda of scholarly inquiry, built upon the steady accre- tion of ideas over time. One can only hope that this work does not represent Jaf- fee's magnum opus on the topic, and that he will continue to contribute actively to the dialogue in the years to come. W.
