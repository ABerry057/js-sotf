Brill, 1998. xii, 362 pp. A translation and revision of Gera's Hebrew dissertation, this book situates the Maccabean revolt in the larger Hellenistic world by examining the histories of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires from 219 to 161 B.C.E. Especially important during this period was the Roman Republic's increasing involvement in the politics of the eastern Mediterranean. The first two chapters examine the period from 220 to 198. Chapter 1 outlines the conflict between the Seleucids and Ptolemies to control Coele-Syria. The second chapter examines Josephus' Tobiad Romance. Gera concludes that the Tobiad stories are propagandistic and of little use historically. He also addresses the question of whether different factions of Jews favored the Egyptian or the Syrian empire, concluding that when conflict erupted between the larger kingdoms, the Jews (and their gentile neighbors) offered opportunistic support for the kingdom that seemed likely to be victorious. The third chapter describes Rome's growing involvement in the East. Before 200 B.C.E., Egypt and Syria were on the periphery of Rome's sphere of interest, but Antiochus III's military successes, especially his conquest of much of Asia Minor (197 B.C.E.), brought the Seleucid kingdom into conflict with Rome in Greece and</page><page sequence="2">110 BOOK REVIEWS Macedonia. When Antiochus invaded Greece, the Romans defeated him and forced him to sign the treaty of Apamea, designed to cripple the Seleucid empire and reduce its military capabilities. The fourth chapter examines the response by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms to Roman expansion and Antiochus the Great's defeat. The Sixth Syrian War was started by Egypt, but in two campaigns (winter 170/169-autumn 169 and spring 168-summer 168), Antiochus IV Epiphanes conquered all of Egypt except Alexandria. Each campaign ended when a Roman envoy forced Epiphanes to withdraw. During the first campaign, Jason, the former high priest, led an attack on Jerusalem in an attempt to depose Menelaus, who had replaced him as high priest. The king interpreted this as a revolt; based on the severity of the attack on Jerusalem, Gera argues that Jason enjoyed popular support, but denies the existence of a pro-Ptolemaic party. The effects of the Sixth Syrian War are described in chapter 5. Egypt was significantly weakened, devastated by Antiochus' army and with two claimants battling for the throne. Syria was in a much stronger position. Although Rome had embarrassingly forced Antiochus to abandon Egypt, the Senate tacitly recognized the Seleucid claim to Coele-Syria and ignored his transgressions of the treaty of Apamea. Gera's discussion demonstrates that Antiochus was a skillful leader, good general, and able politician; Polybius' allegations that he was an insane megalomaniac are propaganda and inaccurate. The Maccabean revolt is the subject of the sixth chapter. According to Gera, Antiochus was still concerned about Jerusalem's loyalty and sent Apollonius the Mysarch to establish a military colony to support Menelaus. In response, many Jews fled to the hills. Antiochus' prohibition of Judaism was designed to quell Jewish resistance, although Gera sheds no light on why this course of action was adopted. As is well known, the prohibitions provoked an open insurrection, led by the Hasmoneans. Seleucid attempts to suppress the uprising utilized local forces and local commanders, indicating that Antiochus did not regard the conflict as significant enough to warrant diverting troops from his Parthian campaign. Antiochus died on this campaign, and in the final chapter Gera discusses the conflicts between the two claimants to the Syrian throne. Demetrius, Antiochus IV's nephew, escaped from Rome and became Antiochus' successor. This offended Rome, and consequently it changed its eastern policy: rather than reacting to events</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 111 in the Hellenistic kingdoms, it became proactive. Rome tried to destabilize the Seleucid kingdom by supporting pretenders to the throne and fomenting revolts among its subject peoples. Gera's analysis demonstrates Rome's diplomatic skill: envoys and diplomatic missions were supported by a powerful army, but force was employed relatively infrequently. Gera's command of both primary and secondary sources is remarkable. The book is well written and clearly organized, but could be improved with maps: Gera discusses battles and movements of envoys frequently, and the inclusion of maps would have made these discussions easier to follow. Gem explains why the Romans sent letters supporting Judah (2 Macc. 11:34-38) and later made an alliance with him (1 Macc. 8:23-32), and also clarifies the question of Jewish factionalism in the period prior to the Maccabean revolt. But the detailed analysis of different factions in the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms and their relations to various Roman envoys and senators outweighs the discussion of Judean politics. Thus, this book may be of greater interest to students of Hellenistic history and the Roman Republic than to students of Second Temple Judaism. Adam L.
