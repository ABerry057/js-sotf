New York: New York University Press, 1998. xii, 164 pp. The perspective taken in this little book is, in the context of critical practice today, at once quaint and, at the same time, refreshing. Hebrew literature is treated here as a sociological phenomenon, a gauge and a product of a particular sociological situation or condition. Perhaps his awareness of how far he is from contemporary praxis is what prompts Aberbach to write: "To the best of my knowledge, the approach of this book and the sum of its conclusions have no precedent in the literature on Hebrew" (p. ix). Such a claim is at best debatable. The compactness of the discussion is incommensurate with the sweeping expansiveness of its main thesis: that "the main peaks of Hebrew literature prior to 1948 were closely linked to upheavals in the empires in which they were created as well as to the culture[s] of these empires" (p. 11). By Hebrew literature the author means not only imaginative belles lettres of the modem period but the full corpus of works written in Hebrew from biblical times up until Israeli statehood. Aberbach discerns four moments in the history of the Jews when the empire in which they were living and its dominant culture reached a crisis point that led to the collapse of both the regime and the culture. Each of these moments precipitated a turning inward of the Jews and thereby catalyzed the creation of a Hebrew literature of unsurpassed originality and artistic quality (i.e., form and content). The four "peaks" of Hebrew literature are the prophetic literature created as the Mesopotamian empires in which the prophets lived reached their apogee and began to decline (750-500 B.C.E.); the rabbinic literature, specifically the Mishnah and the early midrashim, created as a response and as a challenge to vulnerable Roman political and cultural hegemony as it began to disintegrate (66-200 C.E.); the Hebrew poetry, secular and religious, written during the fall of the Umayyad caliphate of Cordoba (103 1-1140); and the revived Hebrew literary works produced in tsarist Russia during the upheaval caused by the failing regime. To be sure, Hebrew literature was written at times and places other than these, but it was these four crisis periods that led to distinctive "aesthetic leaps" in form and content (p. 8) and demonstrate that, more than any other literature, "Hebrew has also inadvertently been an unusually sensitive antenna of global upheaval" (p. 26). "The</page><page sequence="2">148 BOOK REVIEWS role of Hebrew in Jewish survival helps to explain the general relationship between dominant cultures and minorities, between crisis, nationalism and creativity" (p. 11). As is evident, the approach is extrinsic and extraliterary. Formalistic issues of language, structure, style, and narratology-the technical things that make literature literary-these are not on the agenda. Everywhere Aberbach writes about "Hebrew" as a cultural product. "Throughout its history, Hebrew is characterized by ambivalence toward the empires in which it was written.... More than any other language, Hebrew served the Jewish people as an aesthetic 'safe territory' from the terror and disillusionment of unstable imperial rule" (p. 25). ? This holistic view of the Hebrew literary tradition as encompassing both modem secular and biblical, rabbinic, and medieval texts and works is not new. It goes back at least to Dov Sadan. Moreover, reading Hebrew literature as a sociological phenomenon has a venerable tradition in the history of Hebrew letters. H. N. Schapira, Avraham Kariv, Simon Halkin, Barukh Kurzweil, and Sadan all handled modem Hebrew literature as Aberbach does; Robert Alter also did and at times continues to do so. As for the attempt that Aberbach makes here to pull the entire Hebrew literary tradition, lengthy and diverse as it is, into the conceptual framework of one underlying, unified thesis-here, too, Sadan and Kurzweil have "been there and done that," albeit with theses different from Aberbach's. The author makes some interesting and important points as he traverses this broad historical itinerary. It is, for example, helpful to see the prophets not only as the bearers of a distinctive universal message that defines the viability of a society by the moral fiber of its individuals, which is how we customarily read them, but to see them in the context of the specific society and empires they addressed. We come to realize that in their emphasis on moral discipline, the prophets prepared the way for Jewish exile long before the rabbis did when they made the halakhah the "portable homeland." Similarly striking is the insight Aberbach adduces from scholars who have studied this matter that "there are many parallels between Judaism and Stoicism, not least because Stoicism deals with moral questions which are central to Judaism and is, therefore, closer to Judaism than any other philosophy in the ancient world" (p. 86). The discussion of Hebrew poetry in the Islamic empire is valuable, too. It makes it clear that the "golden age" of Spain was not so golden after all. It was, we are reminded, a time of major political and military instability, and the cultural synthesis that the great poets achieved was precarious.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 149 The best part of the final chapter on Hebrew in the tsarist empire is the connections Aberbach makes between the Hebrew writers of the nineteenth century and their Russian contemporaries. Aberbach's knowledge of Russian literature and his skills as a comparatist would be well served if he were to do a full study of the transaction of modem Hebrew literature with the Russian tradition. One wonders why this book is so short. The treatment seems needlessly skimpy. Much of the text reads like outline notes of lectures. The tone is flat and often dry. We need to hear much more about the figures Aberbach holds up as important. The discussions of Gabirol and Halevi are especially truncated. And the book ends abruptly. There is no concluding chapter on what the larger implications might be of the "sociological Gestalt" that Aberbach constructs in his introduction and follows through on in the succeeding four chapters. It is ultimately unsatisfying to be shown that Hebrew literature is a response to Diaspora and then told nothing about what this point might portend for the future, when the seedbed of "Hebrew" is a sovereign Jewish state. This book would be useful as an introductory reading in an introductory course on modem Hebrew literature. James S. Diamond Princeton University Princeton, New Jersey</page></plain_text>
