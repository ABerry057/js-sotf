<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAMPION OF ORTHODOXY: THE EMERGENCE OF SAMSON RAPHAEL HIRSCH AS RELIGIOUS LEADER by ROBERT LIBERLES When the second generation proponents of Reform in Germany initiated a wave of intellectual, liturgical, and communal activity in the mid-1830s, Samson Raphael Hirsch immediately appeared on the scene as defender of the Jewish legal tradition. While Michael Creizenach's Schulchan Aruch was initiated in 1833 and Abraham Geiger introduced his Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift fuerjuedische Theologie in 1835, Hirsch's first book, The Nine- teen Letters of Ben Uziel, appeared as early as 1836, and his precocious response left little doubt that he was to be Orthodoxy's champion in the strife just beginning. When Hirsch came to Frankfurt in 1851, he was known as the most pro- gressive leader of German Orthodoxy, but he gradually emerged as its most uncompromising and militant defender. Hirsch was a puzzle for his con- temporaries and has remained so for later scholars seeking to unravel the complex components of his personality. Although Hirsch is often depicted as virtually a product of spontaneous generation, and, indeed, he often por- trayed himself as well as his followers in that light, the preparation for his assuming the leadership of German Orthodoxy can to a great extent be traced to his family and community background. In short, the formative forces in the shaping of Hirsch's career derived from his childhood in Ham- burg. 43</page><page sequence="2">44 ROBERT LIBERLES I. Childhood in Hamburg A short, but insightful, biographical essay, published in 1908 in honor of the centennial of Hirsch's birth, cogently suggested that Hirsch's grand- father, Menachem Mendel Frankfurter, had exerted considerable influence upon the young Hirsch's development.' Born in 1742, Frankfurter studied in the yeshiva of the well-known Altona rabbi Jonathan Eibeschuetz. After a brief career as a teacher in Stuttgart and Berlin, he returned home and sup- ported himself commercially, while he served the local Jewish community as a member of the board and, for an extended period, voluntarily as head of the Altona rabbinical court.2 In 1805, Frankfurter founded a school for poor children in Altona and later led the directorship of the expanded Tal- mud Torah School that served the three sister-communities of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck.3 The Talmud Torah School was conducted on the principle of teaching both religious studies and basic secular subjects. Frankfurter hoped to instill in the pupils that combination of religious knowledge and occupational training he deemed necessary for a man to support himself properly and skillfully. Each lad would then be equipped to choose his own source of live- lihood, whether it be Torah, commerce, or a skilled profession.4 In a report sent to the occupying French authorities in 1812, Frankfurter explained that the school instructed poor children who otherwise would be unable to attend public schools. Subjects included Hebrew grammar, the Bible with commentaries, and Talmud with commentaries, as well as writing, arith- metic, and the German and French languages. To the local community authorities, he wrote: "For the past eight years the community school has taught religion, writing, and arithmetic, and since 1810, French as well. The 1.

Thus, Mendel Frankfurter had already indicated the path Orthodoxy should take and that, indeed, Hirsch later did take. Orthodoxy would come to terms with the expanding role of the Jew in society, especially with the increasing economic opportunities, but it would simultaneously insist on the traditional basis of religious practice and on the primary place of religious studies in the Jewish school. Both in his capacity as head of the school and in his other roles within the community, Frankfurter played an active part in the religious contro- versies of the second decade of the nineteenth century. The proponents of reform succeeded in delaying for almost ten years the appointment of a chief rabbi in Hamburg, while Frankfurter was among those who realized the damage that the leadership vacuum was inflicting upon the traditionalist cause. Frankfurter himself was appointed to a commission formed in 1820 to resolve the religious differences within the community.6 Meanwhile, the Reformers also asserted their efforts in an attempt to secularize the curricu- lum of the Talmud Torah School headed by Frankfurter. These efforts were resisted by the school board, which included not only Hirsch's grandfather, but also his great uncle Tobias Frankfurter, another relative, Samuel Elias Frankfurter, and his own father, Raphael Hirsch.7 In 1818, when Hirsch was ten years old, the controversy between the two camps in Hamburg took a new turn with the opening of the Reform Temple. The establishment of an independent Reform synagogue hardly eased ten- sions within the broader community, since the two sides disputed the legiti- macy of such a synagogue. Both camps turned beyond Germany toward Hungary for rabbinical support, and an extensive exchange of polemics followed.8 5. Duckesz, "Genealogie," pp. 119-20.

Meyer,</page><page sequence="4">46 ROBERT LIBERLES These events in Hamburg during Hirsch's youth were of primary impor- tance in the shaping of his career. In Ben Uziel's second letter, Hirsch explained to his correspondent: "It was my own inner life-plan and not external necessity that caused me to choose the Rabbinate." That life-plan had been fixed during Hirsch's youth as he himself testified in a source related through some of those associated with him. He himself often said that it had, in fact, been the defection from Judaism in his native city that had brought him to the path of life on which he led the exhausted holy heritage of the fathers from victory to victory. As an eleven and twelve year old lad, he witnessed the meetings in his parents' home, in which the traditionalists discussed the events of the day and the steps to be taken in order to oppose the bold, impertinent actions of the innovators. The helpless, despairing pain that these valiant men bespoke with their words and their destitute countenance, had so affected the boy, that he then vowed to dedicate his life to the Jewish heritage which had been given up by its own chil- dren.9 Hence, Samson Raphael Hirsch grew up within an atmosphere charged with the tensions of the religious dispute between Orthodoxy and Reform. That may seem to be an insignificant observation, but, in fact, it helps to explain how Hirsch could emerge at what seemed like a remarkably early date for an Orthodox response against Reform. The movement for reform in Hamburg was preceded by the reforms introduced in Westphalia under the leadership of Israel Jacobsohn, but there the religious innovations were introduced under the protection of the Napoleonic government.'0 Reform Judaism began in Germany in Westphalia, but the religious controversy between Orthodoxy and Reform began in Hamburg, and the child Hirsch witnessed the height of that strife first-hand in his own home between the ages of seven and thirteen.

HIRSCH AS RELIGIOUS LEADER 47 II. Hirsch and Horeb By the late 1830s, Samson Raphael Hirsch was established as a signifi- cant figure in the religious world of German Jewry, an achievement attained by the publication of his first two books on Jewish law and thought. In 1835, Hirsch submitted his first work, Horeb, for publication, but by request of the publishers he prepared the shorter, more popularly written, Nineteen Letters, which was published under the pseudonym of Ben Uziel, in 1836 and followed by Horeb in 1837.1 Horeb, subtitled Essays on Israel's Duties in the Dispersion, is a com- pendium of Jewish laws, interspersed with Hirsch's often original interpreta- tions of their spiritual significance. The commandments were classified by Hirsch into six categories, as he explained in detail in The Nineteen Letters. I2 The writing of such a compendium was precipitated by the early seeds of a Reform theology that were emerging in the mid-1830s. Less known than Geiger's scholarly Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift, but more related to the writing of Horeb, was the publication in 1833 by Michael Creizenach, leader of the Reform party in Frankfurt, of the first volume of his Schulchan A ruch, a "Comprehensive Presentation of Mosaic Law."'3 Creizenach sought to demonstrate in this work that talmudic Judaism had frequently strayed from its biblical origins. While these deviations were employed by the Reformers as precedent for their own innovations, Creizenach also main- tained that the rituals established by the rabbis no longer bore any actual religious significance in contemporary Judaism: "Every religious system has two fundamentally different components: instruction on the most con- sequential questions . .. plus a collection of regulations and rules of con- duct. ... In no other religious system as in the Mosaic are these two primary components, teachings of faith and duties, so sharply separated." Creize- 11. Hirsch Jubilaeums-Nummer, p. 10.

In contrast to his predecessor, Hirsch attempted to attain a spiritual understanding of Jewish law without infringing upon the significance of ritual practice: "Even, therefore, if every divine precept were a riddle to us ... the obligatory power of the commandments would not in the slightest degree be impaired .... We should have to perform them, not because there was this reason or another for any commandment, but because God had ordained it."" The practice of law could not be affected by the search for spiritual understanding. Hirsch, therefore, returned to a tradi- tional distinction in Jewish learning between the study of law and of legend. But in Hirsch's formulation, aggadah became identified with that specific endeavor of providing legal practice with spiritual meaning: "There will accordingly be two spheres of thought engaged in the exposition of the divine law, differing only in the sources from which they draw their knowl- edge. One school will concern itself with the comprehension of the utter- ances regulating our practical conduct and with the lessons also concerned with practice, that can be derived almost exclusively from the tradition.... The other school will concern itself with reflecting and pondering on the law, and its source of knowledge will be the illuminating power of insight which dwells more or less within each individual."'6 Critical control over these subjective interpretations was to be provided by the specific details of the ritual: "The more closely a view regarding any law corresponds to the component part of the law .. . such that it can be represented as embodying the basic idea through which all the details of the law can be coordinated ... the more will such a view commend itself to us."'7 Through his emphasis on legal specifics, Hirsch sought to ensure the sig- nificance of continued practice. According to Isaac Heinemann, it was this very emphasis on details that characterized Hirsch's unique contribution to the genre of literature concerned with examining the reasons behind Jewish 14.

All references to Hirsch's writings have been made to the available English translations, although the translations themselves have at times been modified. The seriousness with which Hirsch took Creizenach's work is indicated in Hirsch's first literary polemic against the Reformers, the Erste Mittheilungen (Altona, 1838) which is devoted to a refutation of the first volume of Creizenach's Schulchan Aruch. 16.

However, Heinemann concluded that Hirsch adopted this emphasis in order to distinguish between the abstract spirituality of Christianity and the spirituality of Judaism revealed in its practices.'8 The suggestion that the writing of Horeb was influenced by the appearance of Creizenach's Schul- chan A ruch implies that at issue for Hirsch was the Reform tendency to sub- stitute spirituality for practice. If any reference to Christianity was intended, it was, then, to demonstrate how un-Jewish the Reform approach was. Hirsch's selection of Horeb as the title of his first work reflects the role he saw both for his book and for himself as providing a constructive alternative to the path of the Reformers. It has generally been assumed that the title, Horeb, was intended by Hirsch to refer to the site of the divine revelation of the Torah to Israel. While, according to the Book of Exodus, the theophany occurred at Sinai, Deuteronomy referred to the site as Horeb. Indeed, it was only natural to assume that Hirsch sought to echo the revelation at Sinai in the title of a book on Jewish law. But just as obvious as the interpretation is the question of why, if Hirsch intended a reference to the revelation alone, he did not choose "Sinai" itself as his title.'9 In fact, Mount Horeb was also known for another biblical event, the dialogue between God and the prophet Elijah, and it was this event which made Horeb especially signifi- cant to Hirsch. And he arose, and ate and drank, and went on the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to the mount of God, Horeb. And he came there to a cave and spent the night there, and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and He said unto him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord, God of Hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and slain Your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left and they seek my life to take it away (I Kings 19:8-10). Moses had received the Torah at Sinai with all of Israel waiting at its foot. Now Elijah too spoke with God at that same mountain, but he stood there 18.

Israel had forsaken its covenant and its God, and only Elijah remained loyal. In 1835, Hirsch sent a copy of the Horeb manuscript to his cousin Z. H. May and sought his assistance in arranging for the work's publication. In an accompanying letter, Hirsch expressed some revealing attitudes of the author toward his work: "If I knew of even one person more capable than myself of pleading the true cause of Israel, my incapable and inexperienced pen would have rested for a long time yet."20 But Hirsch dismissed the ability of all others to undertake the task. The older generation revered Judaism but treated it as an "inherited mummy," while the younger genera- tion showed enthusiasm, but was, nevertheless, ignorant of "authentic Judaism." Hirsch perceived himself as the single source of strength in the midst of Judaism's crisis: "And in such conditions should we condone a pas- sive silence? No, it is a duty to speak out if one is able only to hint at a route which others might valiantly follow. I must speak, mainly because no one else does so; this is the only justification for my coming forward. God will help me. I do not ask for the prize of battle. I shall be happy to be merely the herald who utters the battle cry. But I am not afraid of the battle, even if I have to fight it on my own." Hirsch's letter echoed Elijah's response to God at Mount Horeb with both men standing alone in defense of God and His law. In his letter to May, Hirsch stated that he was prepared to take up the battle alone, but did he really think that a single man could be effective in spiritual warfare? In fact, Hirsch repeatedly referred to the potential efficacy of a lone Israelite arising in defense of his God. In his discussion of the Hanukkah holiday, Hirsch transformed the usual theme of the righteous few against the powerful into his own personal motif: "And even if round about you everything becomes defiled by the oppression of time, so long as the light remains pure within the confines of only one house or within the breast of only one man, the spiritual life of Israel is saved; God watches over it, and even by the light of one man He rekindles it anew."21 The spiritual plight of his own day was no different in Hirsch's view, as can be seen from his conclusion of Ben Uziel's eighteenth letter: "If only one remains-one Jew with the Book of the Law in his hand, with Israel's law in his heart, 20. The letter appeared in English in Horeb, 1:cxli-cxlv. It also appeared in Hebrew with minor differences in Sinai 14 (1944): 62-64. 21. Horeb, 1: 154.</page><page sequence="9">S. R. HIRSCH AS RELIGIOUS LEADER 51 Israel's light in his spirit-that one suffices; Israel's cause will not be lost."22 The author of Horeb and of The Nineteen Letters saw himself as the man who would undertake the battle in his generation, but even as Hirsch thought that he stood alone, he relied upon a spiritual prototype to serve as his model. We can now proceed to demonstrate that he drew his inspiration at first from the prophet Elijah and later from the biblical hero Phinehas as well. For many years, while Hirsch served as rabbi in Frankfurt, he published his own journal, Jeschurun. At a younger age, Hirsch had also planned to publish a periodical which never appeared. However, the prospectus for this earlier journal was found among Hirsch's papers and published by his descendants and followers in their own journal Nachalath Zwi. Hirsch's pro- posed periodical was to be called Karmel-eine Zeitschrift fuer Leben und Wissenschaft im Judentum. The paper's motto came from Elijah's encounter with the people at Mount Carmel: How long will you hobble between two different opinions? if the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him. And they said, The Lord, He is God, The Lord, He is God (I Kings 18). The prospectus also contained the journal's first-and only-article, entitled "Karmel und Sinai," in which Hirsch contrasted the roles of the two mountains."2 Sinai was the source of God's law, but as centuries passed Israel's commitment to that law weakened, until "there came a time when statesmanship itself was deemed higher than the words of Sinai." Altars were built to Baal and Israel became enveloped in darkness. It was then that Elijah arose and, through his fires at Carmel, once again brightened the night. The words of Sinai returned to Israel's breast, and the people burst forth with the affirmation that "the Lord alone, He is God." But the light seen at Carmel was a mere flash in the night, for immediately thereafter, Elijah was forced to flee to Sinai (sic) where he bemoaned to God in a pas- sage quoted by Hirsch the fact that all of Israel's sons had forsaken the covenant, and "I, even I only, am left." Hirsch then proceded to contrast the roles of Moses and Elijah: "Moses 22. Nineteen Letters, p. 208. 23. See the prospectus in Nachalath Zwi, 2 (1932): 257-60.</page><page sequence="10">52 ROBERT LIBERLES died. Lucky Moses! Moses could die, for his mission at Sinai had been accomplished. Elijah did not die. Elijah could not die, for his mission at Carmel was unfinished." Hirsch followed with five successive paragraphs all beginning rather pointedly with the recurring words-"Elijah lives": Elijah lives. His spirit is carried on in the mouths of the prophets who followed him. .... Elijah lives. His spirit is present in every newborn in Israel.... Elijah lives. Whenever the words of Sinai shall again be obliterated in Israel ... whenever again in Israel the grandchildren do not wish to continue the building started by the fathers, but wish to lay a new foundation unknown to the fathers, whenever night falls once again on Israel, then too will Elijah rise once again with his spirit of fire and again form the bond of the fathers with the children and the bond of the children with the fathers, before the world is brought to ruin.24 Hirsch's selection of Horeb as the title of his work allowed him to com- bine the contributions of Carmel and Sinai, for Horeb signified the presence of both Moses and Elijah and symbolized simultaneously the revelation of the law as well as its defense. This dual interpretation is not imposed upon Hirsch, for he revealed it himself in a passage written some years later, fol- lowing the juxtaposition of the two events in the Book of Malachi: "Remember the Torah of My servant Moses which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances [Malachi 3:22]." Wait for My word: Do not be alarmed because in the present break-up of society the old generation which followed the Torah cannot fit itself into modern life and the new generation turns its back on the old. Await My word! In a similar period of upheaval I once sent you My prophet Elijah who restored the ruined altar of Israel and assembled the priests of Baal for the judgement of God on Mount Carmel. Wait for My word! "Behold, I will send to you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and awful day of the Lord. [Malachi 3:23]."25 Hirsch was more than inspired by Elijah; he fully identified with the 24. Hirsch indicated at the end of this passage that it came from Malachi (3:23). However, there are several changes in nuance from the biblical passage, one of which was the transforma- tion of Elijah as one who will come at the end of days to Elijah as a reappearing savior. 25.

HIRSCH AS RELIGIOUS LEADER 53 ancient prophet and envisioned himself as the reincarnation of his spirit. "Elijah lives," emphasized Hirsch, and he will reappear whenever Israel should again be enveloped in darkness. In 1868, Hirsch returned to the Eli- jah theme and expanded the concept of Elijah's eternal return in Israel's hours of trouble. In an essay entitled "Phinehas-Elijah," Hirsch adopted the merging of these two biblical personalities as presented in the midrashic interpretations.26 Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, was the biblical hero who had assuaged God's anger by slaying a tri- bal prince and his foreign mistress for transgressing God's commandments. Once again Hirsch transformed the active response of the courageous indi- vidual into a paradigm for future generations: Phinehas had shown that God's cause, the cause of His law on earth, had found a response, even if only in the heart of one man. As long as even one man has the courage to take up the struggle openly for God's cause ..., it is not lost on earth and the intervention of divine judgment is not required. He had demonstrated for all time that whenever the sanctity of God and His law is being mocked and trampled on, every other consideration must give way.27 Turning his attention from Phinehas to Elijah, Hirsch again related the encounter between God and Elijah at Mount Horeb, but now Elijah and Phinehas were presented by Hirsch as one: "The spirit of Phinehas re- appeared in Elijah the Tishbite."28 The motif of spiritual reincarnation begun by the Midrash was extended by Hirsch. As in the past, so in the pre- sent days of darkness, the spirit of Elijah will reappear. "Wait for His word! The upheaval will not last forever. The spirit of the returning Elijah is the physician... ."29 Hirsch's readers understood the title Horeb as an echo of the theophany at Sinai, but to Hirsch himself it captured the image of one man standing alone and spreading God's truth to the people of the covenant. That was Hirsch's self-image and with different emphases it remained so until the end of his days. In rabbinic tradition, Elijah is the forerunner of the messianic 26. The essay appeared in Jeschurun 14 (1868): 205-15. It is available in English in Judaism Eternal, 2: 291-300.

At the conclusion of "Phinehas-Elijah," Hirsch wrote: "Elijah is not Messiah, but he precedes Messiah and as long as Elijah is not here the Messiah too will not be here." Hirsch had also written to his cousin May, "I shall be happy to be merely the herald who utters the battle cry."30 How did it happen that Hirsch was able to envisage himself as a spiritual reincarnation of Elijah the prophet? To answer this question, we return to Hirsch's own explanation of how he decided upon his personal life plan. As retold by his 1908 biographer, Hirsch was deeply affected as a child by the meetings held in his father's home to adopt a strategy for fighting the Reformers. The significant point in this anecdote was that Hirsch witnessed his father's helplessness in the wake of the Reform activities. Actually, Hirsch was not accurate in his evaluation of the effectiveness of those meet- ings. We cannot speak specifically of his father's role, but the childhood pic- ture of his father's impotence was stamped upon his mind, and his attitude toward the Reformers was shaped by this impression. One possible reaction by an individual to this constellation of personal factors would be deep hos- tility toward that force which had made his father appear weak before his own eyes. However, if the son who had witnessed this humiliation felt his own hostility toward his father, he could actually develop an admiration for that same opposing force. In fact, Hirsch's attitude toward the Reformers was not uniform throughout his career, and there was a period in the 1830s when he sought to be close to them. Once rejected by them, he became their vehement opponent.3' So little is known of Hirsch's childhood that one might well object that a single source cannot become the basis for such an analysis. Yet, it is precisely because Hirsch himself singled out this specific information to explain the origins of his life commitments that the anecdote should be taken quite seriously in trying to understand him. The credibility of the source, which was related in print only through a secondary channel, can be confirmed by reference to a different entry that does appear in Hirsch's writ- ings, in fact, in the essay, "Phinehas-Elijah." Here is Hirsch's description of the story of Phinehas as related in that essay: 30. Ibid., p. 300 and Horeb, p. cxliii. 31.

HIRSCH AS RELIGIOUS LEADER 55 The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. The heads of the people were assembled to sit in judgement on this crime, when-before the very eyes of Moses and the gathering of the people-one of the leaders, the prince of a tribe, passed by defiantly with his alien mistress. At the sight of this depth of demoralization, the arm raised in judgement fell powerless and Moses and the heads of the people were reduced to impotent tears. To Phinehas, one of the youngest of those present, these helpless tears spelt despair of his people's future. So he arose alone from the midst of the congregation, seized a spear and cut them both down, the man and the woman. Thus did he halt the plague which had already begun to smite the people. .... Eleazar the father, Aaron the grandfather, Moses even, the great-uncle,-priests, teachers, and judges of the law-remained silent and wept-the offenders were a prince and the daughter of a prince; yet the young man who had not even been included in the priestly dedication of his father, arose and accomplished the deed which should not have had to await his intervention.32 In this form, the story is quite parallel to Hirsch's personal anecdote. The elders, including the hero's father, were gathered together at a meeting to discuss an urgent problem of assimilation. They gathered with strong inten- tion, but proved too impotent to activate a plan. In the biblical story, salva- tion was delivered by "one of the youngest present." In the analogue, the child Hirsch resolved to become the saving force. Hirsch's interpretation of the story confirms that the two anecdotes were interchangeable or, better, quite identical in his mind. Based upon the bibli- cal identification of Phinehas as "the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest," the various Midrashim did make some references to the family relationships of those gathered together at the council.33 Hirsch expanded further upon this approach to the extent that he somewhat extraordinarily presented the assembly of the leaders of Israel in such personal terms as father, grandfather, and great-uncle Moses. Hirsch's transformation of the meeting of Israel's sages into a family conclave of Phinehas's older relatives resulted from the impact of those parallel meetings in Hirsch's childhood. In fact the correlation between the two meetings goes even further. Using the history of the Talmud Torah School and E. Duckesz's summary of Hirsch's family history, we can deduce that among those on the board of the Talmud 32. Judaism Eternal, 2: 291-92. The biblical account is in Numbers 25. 33. Ginzberg, Legends, 3: 385, 388-89.</page><page sequence="14">56 ROBERT LIBERLES Torah at the time of these struggles with the Reformers were not only Hirsch's father, but, of course, his grandfather, and also Mendel Frank- furter's brother, Tobias Frankfurter, Hirsch's great-uncle.34 Hirsch's interpretation of the Phinehas story includes a completely irrelevant detail that Phinehas had been rejected by his father and not included in his priestly dedication. This element of the narrative can be understood only if we assume that it was Hirsch himself who had suffered such a rejection and was projecting his own feelings back into the Phinehas story.35 The sense of rejection by his family implied by this superfluous com- ment would help explain his later deep desire to prove himself in a realm of paternal impotence. It also helps to explain why Hirsch emphasized so often that he had been left alone to battle on behalf of God's cause.36 In sum, the striking similarity of Hirsch's childhood anecdote with his rendition of the Phinehas story leads to the possibility that Hirsch decided at a young age to find his own identity within that sphere in which he con- sidered his father to have been proven impotent. He apparently reached that decision as a consequence of a feeling of rejection by his family. He later recognized first in Elijah and then in Phinehas a complete reflection of his personality, his biography, and his ambitions, and he identified himself as the continuation of their spirit. He shared with them the image of a lone, isolated figure serving the cause of God and His law, and he began his battle alongside Elijah at Mount Horeb. 34. See n. 1 above. 35. In fact, contrast Hirsch's rendition with the traditional Midrash in which Aaron's wife Elisheba counts among her joys "her grandson, Phinehas, priest of war." Ginzberg, Legends, 3: 187 based on Zevaklim 102a. My gratitude to Dr. Carmi Horowitz for calling this Midrash to my attention. 36. An additional literary clue to Hirsch's perceived estrangement from his father is pro- vided when Hirsch misquoted the biblical passage describing Elijah's flight to Horeb, for Hirsch added the words actually spoken by Elijah earlier in the chapter--" am no better than my fathers." Hirsch effectively moved this phrase from I Kings 19:4 to 19:14, so that these words were now spoken by Elijah at Horeb, which was not the case in the biblical account. "Karmel und Sinai," Nachalath Zwi 2 (1932): 258-59. In studying the dynamics of Hirsch's personality, an objective evaluation of the father-son relationship would prove not only speculative, but far less relevant than Hirsch's perception of that relationship as revealed in his literary testimony. Of interest, however, is the singular account by Heinrich Graetz of the interaction between Hirsch and his father during the latter's visit to Oldenburg, when Hirsch proved embarrassed by his father's demonstrations of love.

"Only I Alone Remain" (I Kings, 19:11,14) At Mount Horeb, Elijah had heard a still, small voice: it was the voice of God. Hirsch too listened to a small voice: "Fame or acknowledgment of my personal merit are not the objects which I seek. .. . No such notion has prompted me to these efforts, but only the inner voice which . . speaks ever to me the same words, saying: There is some truth in your views, some of that truth which, you think, must ultimately struggle forth into the light of victory."37 Hirsch did not actually claim that he had been the recipient of divine revelation, although in one passage in the Nineteen Letters, he came quite close to that position: "I have climbed alone to a height from which a new view displays itself to me. On that very account, it falls on me to sum- mon companions, to descend and to begin again the journey with those friends who will join me.""8 Despite the powerful religious forces acting upon his personality, Hirsch remained true to rationalism; he did not speak out as the bearer of revelation, but as the bearer of truth-as the lone pos- sessor of truth. From the descriptions we have of Hirsch, we know that he needed to be alone.39 We have seen that he believed himself to be alone. Hirsch also fabricated the historical evidence to prove that he was alone. Many of the puzzles confronted by Hirsch's biographers arose because writers on Hirsch were misled by documentation that they presumed to be historically accurate, but that, in fact, was the product of a mythology created by Hirsch and shaped by his own self-image. Moreover, Hirsch bequeathed to later generations an historical picture that has been widely accepted depicting the helpless state of the Orthodoxy of his early days, but it too derives more from his personal self-image than from historical reality. Let us examine three examples of that picture of helplessness and isolation portrayed by Hirsch. In the childhood anecdote to which I have referred, Hirsch described the atmosphere that permeated the meetings held in his parents' home in Ham- 37. Hirsch, Letters, p. 213.

Whatever the initial reactions of the participants may have been to the attempts of the Reformers to interfere with the curriculum of the Talmud Torah School and to the appointment of a traditional rabbi for the Hamburg community, the suc- cessful outcome of the Orthodox efforts would not indicate the sense of despair and impotence described by Hirsch. In actuality, the Orthodox rebuffed the attempt to impose reforms on the school's program and suc- ceeded in electing Isaac Bernays as community rabbi.40 While we do possess some information on Hirsch's secular education, his Jewish education has remained somewhat of a puzzle. Yet we cannot conclude because of sparse information that Hirsch was not a well-educated rabbi. After all, we do not require biographical data to realize that the author of Horeb and of Hirsch's biblical commentaries was not an ignorant man. We do know that Hirsch studied with Isaac Bernays and Jacob Ettling- er. We also know that he continued to devote much of his time to study after beginning his career as a rabbi. Furthermore, the numerous Hebrew halakhic letters in the Hirsch archive support the notion that Hirsch was a learned rabbi, frequently involved in an exchange of legal views.41 Why, then, has Hirsch's religious education become such a puzzle? The answer lies with Hirsch himself, for it was he who obscured the role played by his teachers. In contrast with Geiger, who wrote a description of his teachers and the extent and limits of their influence upon him, Hirsch con- tinually denied that his thinking had been informed by others. Hence his remark in the nineteenth letter that he "has climbed alone to a height ... ."42 Hence his oft-quoted remark in that same chapter: "I have evolved the view of the reconstruction of Judaism as a science almost solely out of my inner consciousness. Only one dear friend assisted me a little in the smaller, easier, and clearer part of the task, and only one star guided me somewhat in the beginning. I have worked myself through to the point where you now find 40. See n. 7 above. 41. Contrast Rosenbloom, Tradition, pp. 53-65 and 409, n. 109.

Were there no teachers to direct him on the way? Later in life, Hirsch expli- citly denied Isaac Bernays's influence upon him. Yet Hirsch was thirteen years old when Bernays became his rabbi, and Hirsch did attend his classes. Was there really no such influence?45 Were there no teachers? Did Hirsch emerge out of an intellectual vacuum? I suggest that Hirsch's statements on his education do not warrant historical credibility. They are merely the liter- ary projections of Hirsch's self-image as we have come to understand it: the image of a man alone. In fact, Hirsch was not the only religious champion to insist upon the immaculate conception of his sacred knowledge, although it is a most unusual motif for a Jewish traditionalist, for Jewish tradition values the continuity of transmission, and Hirsch's claims contradicted that value. The images drawn by Hirsch in these two examples depict more than just his personal background: they provide a commentary on the state of Ortho- doxy in general in the early years of the nineteenth century. They portray an Orthodox leadership that was too paralyzed to oppose the Reform initia- tives and Orthodox teachers who were incapable of finding even the seeds of a response to the challenges of the day. The third and best-known example of Hirsch's descriptions of Orthodox isolation is the tale of the eleven founders of the Israelitische Religions- gesellschaft of Frankfurt. In his own account of the establishment of the future citadel of German Orthodoxy, Hirsch insisted that a mere eleven men had been responsible for its founding. Later writers even extrapolated that Hirsch had actually come to Frankfurt to serve a community of that size. Neither statement bears a shred of historical accuracy, but it is intriguing that the myth of the eleven founders was cogently attacked by Saemy Japhet in his valuable memoirs published more than thirty years ago; yet the myth 43.

Paradoxically, that image of German Jewry derives in no small measure from the descriptions that have been left behind by S. R. Hirsch and his followers. Their testimonies were judged as the state- ments of creditable witnesses who would surely not exaggerate the weakened state of their own party. But they did just that, as they proceeded to laud- and exaggerate-their own accomplishments in rebuilding German Ortho- doxy. When the myths surrounding Hirsch are peeled away, there remains one of the most effective community leaders of German Jewry in the nineteenth century. But not only must those myths be removed. No less, the historical picture of German Jewry that has been so deeply informed by that same mythology must also be reconstructed.47 Department of History Ben Gurion University of the Negev Beersheba, Israel 46.
