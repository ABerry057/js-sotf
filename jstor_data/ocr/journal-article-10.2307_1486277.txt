<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonathan D. Sarna. Jacksonian Jew. The Two Worlds of Mordecai Noah. New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1981. 233 pp. Jacksonian Jew is a meticulously researched and elegantly written biography of Mordecai Manuel Noah, the Jacksonian era journalist, newspaper editor, politician, and Jewish communal leader who was widely acknowledged to be the most important American Jew of his time. Jonathan D. Sarna's thoughtful new study makes a major contribution to the his- torical literature on Jacksonian America and to our understanding of the early-nineteenth-century American Jewish experience as well. Born in 1785, Mordecai Noah served at various times as American consul in Tunis, sheriff of New York City, and grand sachem of Tammany Hall, and was actively involved in the preeminent political events of his day. Noah was unquestionably the most influential (as well as the most contro- versial) Jewish political figure in early-nineteenth-century America, an era during which few Jews actively sought public office and "Jews exercised more power through appointive offices than through elective ones" (p. 43). While Noah's immediate political ambitions were often frustrated, he probably exercised more real political influence than any other American Jewish politician prior to Judah P. Benjamin's election to the United States Senate in the 1850s. During his long political career, Noah, who played some role in every presidential campaign from 1808 to 1848, vindicated the faith in the American political process and the emerging two-party system shared by a growing number of Jews of his era. Indeed, so politically secure were Jews in Jacksonian America that Noah could (during the election of 1824) facetiously suggest himself as a candidate for president, the first</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 121 American Jew to do so. While, as Sarna notes, Noah "did not delude himself into believing that a Jew could be elected President of the United States," he could argue, nonetheless, that the very possibility of a Jewish president was "unanswerable proof of the perfect freedom of our political institutions." Only in America, Noah and other Jews "proudly proclaimed," did a Jew "have the right even to suggest himself for the nation's highest office" (p. 43). Throughout his public career, Noah evolved from a liberal Jeffersonian and Jacksonian to a conservative Whig and staunch apologist for slavery. "Unsurprisingly," notes Sarna, Noah began his political career with the Democratic-Republican party of Thomas Jefferson and Madison, which, unlike the Federalists, "welcomed Jews, and allowed them to rise to high positions within the party" (p. 5). His political preference for the Jeffer- sonians was quite understandable, for while a few influential Jews, such as the Gratz family, did identify as Federalists, the majority of Noah's Jewish contemporaries shared the opinion of Philadelphia merchant Benjamin Nones, who is reported to have stated: "I am a Jew, and if for no other, for that reason I am a republican." Securing a "significant place" in the Democratic-Republican party, Noah "acted somewhat like a professional court Jew," appealing to the Jeffersonian party's hierarchy on behalf of Jewish concerns and promising Jewish electoral loyalty to James Madison, whom he vigorously supported for president. As reward for his political support, Madison appointed Noah American consul in Tunis, where he served (albeit with little distinction) from 1813 to 1815, the first of several patronage appointments Noah would receive during his political career. While Noah's early support for liberal Jeffersonian democracy was thus understandable, his subsequent "conversion to the Whig cause" seems "at first glance to be surprising" (p. 100). Sarna's analysis of the "conservative shift in Noah's politics" is both brilliant and provocative. He examines in detail Noah's involvement with Andrew Jackson's battle against the Bank of the United States, the political struggle that "forged" the Jacksonian movement. As Sarna so well illustrates, the "Bank War" was not only the issue that divided politicians and led to the creation of the Whig party; it brought about "the political downfall" of Mordecai Noah as well. He also discusses Noah's attitudes towards Irish Catholic immigration and his role (in 1835) in establishing the Native American Democratic Association, a nativist organization which Noah took pains to stress was "not avowedly anti-Catholic." Significant attention is given, moreover, to the issue of slavery, which</page><page sequence="3">122 BOOK REVIEWS Noah both vigorously defended and espoused. Noah's defense of slavery, argues Sarna, was "unusually strident" even for a "confirmed anti- abolitionist." During the 1820s Noah apparently developed a profound fear of blacks, and warned against "an excess of indulgence to the domestic black of the South." To emancipate slaves, he warned, "would be to jeopar- dize the safety of the whole country" (p. 111). Viewing the abolitionists as a group of "fanatics" at war with America, Noah supported measures aimed at restraining them. He, moreover, took the rather extreme position (shared, to my knowledge, by almost no other Jewish leader of his era) of invoking -biology to "prove" that blacks were an "inferior species to the white" (p. L12). Freedom's Journal, the first black newspaper in America, responded to Noah's attack by calling him the black man's "bitterest enemy," a point that was apparently made the most of by those black and abolitionist leaders who "noted with surprise" that Noah was a Jew and proceeded to use Noah's Judaism as a weapon of attack. Thus, for example, the abolitionist Edmund Quincy would argue that if Noah was "a fair specimen of his race, it is no wonder that they have been an insulted and despised people" (p. 113). This was not, moreover, the only instance in which Noah's Jewishness became an object of public attack. As Professor Sarna's study so well documents, Jacksonian America had its share of anti-Semitism, against which Noah continuously had to contend. Defending individual Jews "as earnestly as he defended Jews as a group," Noah never hesitated in con- demning manifestations of anti-Semitism, even when (on occasion) it might have been more politically expedient to remain silent. For, as blatantly opportunistic as Noah could often be in his quest for financial reward and political advancement (Sarna, it should be noted, examines this less attrac- tive aspect of Noah's public career in thorough detail), he never sought to downplay his Jewishness, and remained "a conscious, loyal and proud member of the Jewish community," who took an increasingly active leader- ship role within American Jewish communal life. Noah's best-known public activity within the Jewish arena, his much- publicized attempt (in the 1820s) to establish a Jewish agricultural colony, which he named Ararat, on Grand Island in the Niagara River near Buffalo, is analyzed by Professor Sarna in both critical and illuminating detail. Ararat, as Noah envisaged it, was to have been a "City of Refuge," a "New Jerusalem," to which oppressed Jews from all over the world would immi- grate. A tax of three shekels of silver, proclaimed Noah, was to be levied "upon each Jew throughout the world" to defray the expenses of the govern-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 123 ment of Ararat, which was to be concentrated in the hands of Noah, who was to be named "Judge of Israel." While Noah remained convinced "that those Jews who needed an asylum would avail themselves of the advantages which Ararat held forth," American and European Jewry did not flock to Ararat. Noah's proto-Zionist plans for Jewish self-government at Ararat were met with ridicule and criticism in the Jewish press, rather than with widespread support. One Jewish leader of the period doubted that anyone would submit to "the self-constituted 'governor' and 'judge of Israel,' " and observed that most people deemed the entire scheme "visionary," criticisms that were echoed by other American Jews. The Jewish people, Sarna con- cluded, "neither needed nor wanted an isolated asylum in a faraway land ruled by a self-appointed judge" (p. 74). While much has been written about Noah's proposal for a Jewish colony at Ararat, Sarna's thoughtful analysis provides, I believe, the most balanced and judicious discussion of the epi- sode, and its significance, to be found in recent American Jewish historical scholarship. Professor Sarna's discussion and analysis of the life and public career of Mordecai Noah, his contributions to American diplomacy, politics, and journalism, his vigorous defense of Jewish rights and leadership role in Jewish educational and philanthropic affairs, his controversial views on immigration, slavery, and other public issues of the day, are set against the background of the "two worlds" within which Noah lived. For, as Sarna convincingly argues, Mordecai Noah was both "quintessentially American" as well as "a Jew in a world of Christians" in Jacksonian America. The achievement that "raised him above his contemporaries and transformed him into an historical figure of enduring importance" (p. 159), Sarna cor- rectly posits, was his ability to confront the tensions between these two identities. As Professor Sarna so succinctly puts it: Noah was the first Jew to confront openly ... the challenge of American freedom. He was the first to demand continuous recognition as both a devoted American and as a devoted Jew. He was the first to explore seriously the pro- found problems faced by Jews in an America composed largely of Christians. He was, in short, the first Jew in American history to gain a national hearing; the first American Jew with sufficient ambition, status and talent to be a leader, Americanizer, a spokesman and a guardian all at once.
