Freedman, co-editor of The Archaeology of the Bible Taubman Lectures in Jewish Studies, $35.00 cloth Preachers of the Italian Ghetto Edited by DAVID B. RUDERMAN In this eloquent collection, six leading scholars of Italian Jewish history discuss the important role of ghetto preachers during the sixteenth century and give a richly textured portrait ofJewish life more than 400 years ago. $32.00 cloth, illustrated Strangers at Home Jews in the Italian Literary Imagination By LYNN M. GUNZBERG Using popular literature as a window on Italian society, Gunzberg explores the representation ofJews in novels and poetry written by non-Jews from the early 1800s to the enact- ment of the Fascist racial laws in 1938. $42.50 cloth, illustrated At bookstores or order 1-800-822-6657.

Manuel "Frank Manuel's well-known mastery of The World of Books' in Europe now helps us over- come many stereotypes that plague the study of Christian-and not so Christian-perceptions of Judaism. The Broken Staff gives the broken picture of how the ambiguities of the Renais- sance and the Enlightenment both produce some improvement and lead to some of the worst chapters in the attitude towardJews. The only way forward in Jewish-Christian relations is through the kind of well-documented knowledge this book offers." -Krister Stendahl, Professor Emeritus, Harvard Divinity School 20 halftones $34.95 cloth LEGACY OF SILENCE Encounters with Children of the Third Reich Dan Bar-On "Knowing the worst is terrible but, as Bar-On finds in this powerful and compassionate book, not knowing is even more terrible. With per- sistence and an odd tenderness, he explores the psychic wounds of silence and suppression. Legacy of Silence is a journey as much as a study. Bar-On travelled with personal trepidation and on a dangerous intellectual borderline." -Richard Eder, Los Angeles Times $12.95 paper SURVIVING THE HOLOCAUST The Kovno Ghetto Diary Avraham Tory Edited and with an Introduction by Martin Gilbert Textual and Historical Notes by Dina Porat Translated by Jerzy Michalowicz 'This Ghetto diary is essential to the compre- hension of fiery events that defy knowledge and imagination." -Elie Wiesel 70 halftones $16.95 paper JUDAISM, HUMAN VALUES, AND THE JEWISH STATE Yeshayahu Leibowitz Edited by Eliezer Goldman Translated by Eliezer Goldman, Yoram Navon, et al. These hard-hitting essays by Yeshayahu Leibowitz, the first to be published in English, constitute a comprehensive critique of Israeli society and politics and a probing diagnosis of the malaise that afflicts contemporary Jewish culture. He considers the essence and character of historical Judaism, the problems of contem- poraryJudaism andJewishness, the relationship of Judaism to Christianity, the questions of statehood, religion, and politics in Israel, and the role of women. $39.95 cloth HITLER'S JUSTICE The Courts of the Third Reich Ingo Miller Translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider With an introduction by Detlev Vagts "By presenting one horrific perversion of justice after the other, Miller effectively destroys one pious myth to be found in postwar legal lit- erature-that judges never wavered from the positivistic tradition of German law and did no more than apply existing codes." -V.R Berghahn, New York Times Book Review $14.95 paper Harvard University Press 79 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 (617) 495-2480</page><page sequence="12">JOHNS HOPKINS JEWISH STUDIES Sander Gilman and Steven T. Katz, Series Editors THE JEWS IN A POLISH PRIVATE TOWN THE CASE OF OPATOW IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY Gershon David Hundert In the eighteenth century more than half of the Jews in the world lived in Poland-Lithuania, and most of the Jews there lived in nobility-owned "private" holdings like the town of Opat6w. Drawing on original documents in Polish, Hebrew, and Yiddish, Gershon David Hundert has produced a unique account of the social, demographic, political, and economic realities of life in this community. $39.95 RUSSIAN-JEWISH LITERATURE AND IDENTITY JABOTINSKY, BABEL, GROSSMAN, GALICH, ROZINER, MARKISH Alice Stone Nakhimovsky In this thoughtful portrayal of the Russian-Jewish writer at the crossroads of history, literature, and ethnic self-definition, Alice Stone Nakhimovsky explores the ways in which twentieth-century literature written in Russian by writers of Jewish origin reflects the changing problems of Russian-Jewish identity. Though Nakhimovsky makes reference to many writers, she concentrates on six striking individuals: Vladimir Jabotinsky, Isaac Babel, Vasily Grossman, Alexander Galich, Felix Roziner, and David Markish. $38.50 i t~ d~ jgb)se ~;9 `ipl,,~paP? ~4r* $- ~ ':"?'.: ..I i~ I~i~ .i " ??r ;d. ?i k ~pi~g~q~k~ ,:i rL i5~i~8 The Johns Hopkins University Press 701 West 40th Street, Suite 275, Baltimore, Maryland 21211 To order, call 1-800-537-5487.</page></plain_text>
