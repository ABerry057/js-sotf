Oxford and Portland, Ore- gon: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2002. xvii, 591 pp. Since the 1965 publication of his Hebrew book, Conversos on Trial, Haim Beinart justifiably has been hailed as the foremost historian of medieval Sepharad. 335</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Over the next three decades, in numerous articles and books, Beinart continued to examine the last years of Jewish life in the Iberian peninsula. It was therefore with great anticipation that Haim Beinart's magisterial overview of the expulsion of the Jews from Castile and Aragon was received when it was published in 1994 in Jerusalem. Now, eight years later, the Littman Library has presented an English translation of this imposing work. Beinart likens his effort in assembling more than one thousand documents as the "construction of a mosaic, stone by stone, to display the picture of the last days of the Jews on Spanish soil." He sees his work as "the story of those heroic Jews who withstood extreme trials and retained their faith, when they took up the vessels of exile and followed Him who put them to that test" (p. xi). Readers who have followed Haim Beinart's writings over the years will find these and other fa- miliar tropes. As we have come to expect, he exults with the Jews who chose ex- ile and is embarrassed and defensive about those who remained with their family and property on Spanish soil. But such ideological assertions, which reflect intense engagement with the material, are few and far between. Instead, we encounter an author encumbered by the documents and unable to provide a convincing framework within which to un- derstand his data. The ten loosely-connected chapters which comprise this work are based overwhelmingly on documents from the Registro General del Sello, mined previously by Luis Suairez Fernandez and judiciously presented in his Doc- umentos acerca de la expulsidn de losjudios, published in 1964. As a result of this documentary bias, Castilian Jewry is narrowly the focus of this work. The sections on Jewish communities within the Crown of Aragon are presented as an after- thought and are based on secondary materials. After initial chapters on Ferdinand and Isabella's attitude toward the Jews and an analysis of the edict of expulsion, Beinart devotes many pages to the fate of communally and privately-owned property and credit. Information is arranged by towns (maps would have been welcome) and his descriptions reflect the legal entanglements involved in the resolution of debts and property. Beinart follows the disposition of communal abbattoirs and baking ovens many years after the expul- sion, even when the property ceased to have any connection to the expulsion or to the Jews and their descendants. Beinart seems to be propelled by the desire to uncover anything which might have belonged to the Jews and to trace its ultimate fate. In an introduction to the fate of Jewish cemeteries and their stones, Beinart writes that with the disposition of this property, "every remnant and memory of Spanish Jewry was to be eradi- cated" (p. 111). Perhaps when he recounts the details of the lawsuits regarding this property, Beinart imagines that medieval Sephardic life can thereby be retrieved and life can be returned to these forgotten stones. In wading through case after case of Jewish loans, also assorted by town, the reader is left overwhelmed by the atomized data and emerges with neither an ap- preciation of the Jewish role within the general economy nor a recognition of a pat- tern of behavior exhibited by Ferdinand and Isabella and their officials. As Beinart writes in a desultory summarizing mode, "This is the picture of Jewish life ... we 336</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews learn of arbitrary actions taken by Christian creditors on the one hand, and on the other of mutual efforts to avoid paying debts. This is no innovation with respect to human behavior. As noted, these documents represent only a tiny fraction of the extant credit. Hence it would be a distortion of the truth were one simply to add up the sums mentioned in these documents" (p. 206). So what indeed have we learned? Beinart's prose throughout the work is comprised essentially of translations of archival material. The original wording of the texts is preserved in his notes. If we view this effort then as a documentary compilation, we can praise our author for having successfully provided the raw data that his successors can use in their own research. Benefits will accrue to historians who fine-comb his chapters on the implementation of the edict, on smuggling, and on the return and conversion of some exiled Jews, even though the writing is weighed down with all the names and officials mentioned in the sources. One of the casualties of this plethora of detail is the translator who, seemingly exhausted, resorts to clumsy and overly literal translations. The translator, Jeffrey Greene, appears to emulate the historian who, in turn, reproduces the documents. Unfortunately, Beinart is not as punctilious when it comes to recognizing how some of his peers have contributed to his narrative. For example, while Beinart footnotes much of the work of Miguel Angel Motis Dolader, he does not cite Mo- tis' important two-volume La expulsi6n de losjudios de la Corona deArag6n pub- lished in 1990, a work which would rival what he is attempting to do in this 1994 volume. Beinart furnishes fascinating material on Abraham Senior-chief collec- tor of taxes of the kingdom of Castile, rab de la corte, and supreme magistrate of the Jews-who, together with some members of his family, converted to Chris- tianity in the wake of the edict. But he avoids acknowledging how Eleazar Gutwirth advanced our understanding of Abraham Senior in an article he published over a decade ago. Beinart's chapter on Don Yitzhak Abravanel contains new material on his fi- nancial activities. Happily, we note citations to Benzion Netanyahu's biography of Abravanel, after having read through hundreds of pages without any reference to Netanyahu's other works. Netanyahu, who sparred with Beinart over the years about the Jewish nature of the converted Jews, had made sure to cite just one arti- cle of Beinart-a 1961 essay on judaizing within the Hieronymite Order, in his 1300 plus pages on The Origins of the Inquisition. Succeeding generations of scholars in medieval Sephardic Jewry would do well to avoid the kind of behavior displayed by their teachers. In Beinart's brief concluding chapter entitled "Con- temporaries Describe the Expulsion," he assembles some interesting information from Jewish and Christian chroniclers, but there is no attempt to integrate this ma- terial with the findings of Yosef Hacker, among others. Admittedly, it is difficult for an archival historian who is literally swamped by hundreds of texts to decide what data are worthy of retelling and thereby lose much of the data he or she has painstakingly uncovered. It is indeed a further chal- lenge, as it is for all historians, to situate the results within a synthetic framework, let alone an overarching view of the historical past. Even in the absence of such at- 337</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews tempts, the data uncovered by Haim Beinart will remain a source for many future generations of historians of the Jews of medieval Iberia. For that alone, we are in- debted to this monumental contribution. Benjamin R. Gampel Jewish Theological Seminary New York, New York</page></plain_text>
