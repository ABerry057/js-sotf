Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004. xiii, 370 pp. In this new book, the author of Rituals of Childhood: Jewish Acculturation in Medieval Europe broadens the scope of his earlier acclaimed work. Moving beyond early childhood and schooling, Marcus devotes chapters to the other major stages of the Jewish life cycle (bar mitzvah, marriage, and death). While seeking to present "a comprehensive guide to Jewish rites of passage," the book also aims to sustain a general thesis: that ritual inventiveness is a persistent pattern of traditional Jewish culture. This inventiveness, the author suggests, entails "Jewish inward accultura- tion," of which he offers examples. In medieval Christian Germany, for example, rites were observed the night before baptism to protect the infant from the evil influence of the demon Holle. In Judaizing this practice, Jews scheduled it on the eve of circumcision, linking it to the divine Abrahamic commandment, "You shall keep (tishmor) my covenant" (Genesis 17:9). The verb tishmor can also be translated as "to watch" or "guard," hence the Jewish rite came to be called wachnacht, the night of watching the child. Thus, Marcus argues, the prac- tice of appeasing Holle was adapted to and anchored in Jewish custom. Similarly, late twelfth-century childhood rites of initiation into Torah learn- ing centered on the child's tasting of symbolic foods to make learning attractive. This practice emerged simultaneously with an increasing emphasis on the sacra- ment of the Eucharist. In the area of memorial rites, German monastic orders kept libri memorialis, in which they noted the deaths of local saints and digni- taries. These lists were publicly read on All Souls' Day. Marcus argues that, in the wake of the crusader massacres, the Jewish communities elaborated their mem- orial rites along lines parallel to those of Christian society. They created memor- biicher that were publicly read four times a year (on the major festivals) to proclaim the sacral standing of individuals who had lost their lives for their Jewish faith. During the later medieval period, German and French Jewry greatly expanded the memorial rites, first for local martyrs and later for family members. In contrast, the memorial ritual of Spanish Jewry did not undergo much development because of the different prevailing conditions with respect to martyrdom and conversion. Even the phenomenon of conversos burnt at the stake during the Inquisition did not give rise there to memorialism comparable to the Ashkenazic rites. The reason for this was probably that individual martyrs were not known in person to any active Spanish Jewish communities because such communities did not usually exist in the localities where conversos were martyred. Marcus's book is replete with arresting information and analyses in many areas of Jewish life-cycle rites. The author reports that until the late Middle 189</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Ages, the practice of draping couples in a tallit during the marriage ceremony was prevalent among German Jews, as it is among the Sephardim to this day. Only later did the practice of using only a huppah canopy supported by poles become common. This is relevant to the historical emergence of present-day Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs. The author also argues that the custom of shattering a glass in memory of the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem became common only in the fourteenth century (166-67). The most important compara- tively recent development in Jewish life-cycle rituals is, Marcus argues, the bar mitzvah celebration. An Ashkenazic, specifically German custom of early modem times, it gradually became accepted in most Jewish communities. However, as late as the mid-twentieth century, Yemenite Jews had not yet adopted the practice. Such data naturally leads one to question why particular practices did or did not develop in certain times and places. Marcus, however, wisely avoids speculation. At one point, he ventures support for Philippe Aries's theory that premodern society did not accord children an identity of their own. They were trained to move into adulthood early rather than fill roles specific to childhood. Because the Jewish child was exposed to adult culture and religion from infancy, Marcus argues, there was no need for a bar mitzvah rite to mark the transition to adulthood. Indeed, the rite became gen- erally accepted in most communities in Europe only in the eighteenth century, when the turmoil of modernity began and Jewish education became sparser. Still, Marcus's explanation raises the question of why the bar mitzvah rite devel- oped earliest in Germany, where Judaism was practiced most devoutly, rather than in Italy, where the gaps in the practice of religion were caused early by the Renaissance. Although the annotation of data in the book is generally adequate, some of the statements remain undocumented and strike this reader as dubious. On page 207, we learn that in Israel, it is the task of burial societies to publicize deaths of local residents by pasting signs on walls. Furthermore, the author asserts that many mourning customs were incorporated into Jewish weddings in order "to fool demons that might jinx the wedding joy" (154-55). This has a speculative ring. The author also states that in the room of seclusion (yihud) after the wedding ceremony, "in some ultra-traditional communities, including some from the Muslim world, the marriage may be consummated" (186). In fact, according to Sephardic halakhah there is no yihud seclusion to begin with; the public huppah is considered sufficient. Among "ultra-traditional" Ashkenazim, engaging in sexual intercourse in the yihud setting is unheard of. Grounded in the prestigious Stroum Lecture Series at the University of Washington, the book is geared toward a contemporary Jewish American audience that is mostly of eastern European background. American Ashkenazic practice is taken as generally prevalent. For example, the custom of consecrating marriages under the open sky is presented as universal (166) despite its absence in Sephardic custom. Additional examples appear on pages 62, 116, 151, 181, 184, 207, 212, and 222. The orientation of the book to a Jewish American audience neglects certain interesting life-cycle practices. One is the hasidic memorial (yahr zeit) practice of offering liquor and cake, usually after the morning service. Another 190</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews is the parallel Sephardic practice of following the ritual reading of Zohar passages (after the evening service) with a meal for the congregants. In addition, although Marcus correctly claims that the Sephardic memorial ritual and liturgy are less rich than the Ashkenazic, in contemporary Israel, Sephardim tend to evince emotion and invest effort in their admittedly lean rites, whereas many Ashkenazim run through their richer memorial liturgy perfunctorily. Anthropologists should take delight in researching these differences. Finally, the editorial work of transforming the oral lectures into book form was not performed with care. Problems of Hebrew transliteration and transcription remain on pages 31, 116, 163 (top), 239 (middle), and 240 (bottom). Garbled sen- tences appear on pages 74 (middle) and 115 (bottom) and infelicities of translation and language usage on pages 66, 100, and 213. Perhaps these will be seen to in a future edition. Students can study this interesting scholarly volume with profit, but they will require some guidance. Shlomo Deshen Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel</page></plain_text>
