<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frederick J. Murphy. Pseudo-Philo: Rewriting the Bible. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 322 pp. In this book Frederick J. Murphy attempts to fill a gap in scholarship on Pseudo-Philo by providing an "interpretation of [Biblical Antiquities] as a unified narrative that maintains a consistent ideological point of view throughout and has an overarching concept of Israel's history that goes beyond</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 135 individual episodes" (p. viii). Consequently, Murphy's literary commentary on this work examines the narrative to see how each episode works and is related to the whole. Murphy's method is a combination of critical modes, using the Bible as a fixed point of comparison, while making no attempt to address in detail questions of parallels, translation, variant readings, and the like. Such matters are left to more conventional commentaries, like those of L. H. Feldman and C. Perrot, which provide the basis for Murphy's own work in that regard. Part I, the "Prologue" (chaps. 1 and 2), introduces the reader to Biblical Antiquities. In chapter 1, "Introduction," Murphy surveys issues of text, genre, dating, and other necessary background information. Murphy dates Biblical Antiquities to sometime in the first century, pre-70, and adopts D. J. Harrington's view that the text type is Palestinian. Using Perrot's distinctions, Murphy refers to Biblical Antiquities as a sort of texte continue, and adopting Harrington's definition of "rewritten Bible," he suggests that it is one of the last examples of this genre. For Murphy, actualization of the biblical stories is the best way to describe Biblical Antiquities, since it is not interested in the Bible for its own sake. Accordingly, he maintains, it is a rewriting of the Bible from Adam to Saul's death that builds a new narrative on the foundation of the biblical stories. The result is a narrative with a life of its own. In chapter 2, "Pseudo-Philo as Narrative," Murphy discusses his method- ology, the work's narrative features, and its literary technique. Murphy applies to Biblical Antiquities narrative criticism that has emerged from scholarship on the Gospels. Thus the text is seen as a whole in which each unit contributes to the larger story. Like the evangelists, Pseudo-Philo uses traditional materials extensively and reworks them to suit his purpose. Murphy employs, therefore, a combination of redaction and narrative criticism to study how Pseudo-Philo rewrites his traditional material. Because the Bible is the main element of traditional material used in Biblical Antiquities and its only continuous source, he justifies limiting his discussion of other literary parallels to footnotes. As he successfully demonstrates in part II, Pseudo-Philo assumes that the biblical text and stories are known by his readers. The narrative features of Biblical Antiquities are discussed illustratively, and in ways typical of recent New Testament literary criticism. Murphy's focus is on story and discourse, author, narrator, point of view, plot, characters, atmosphere and setting, and irony. Especially insightful in the treatment of literary technique is his study on the degree of rewriting of the Bible evident in Biblical Antiquities. He finds four categories of rewriting: heavy dependence on quotations of biblical passages;</page><page sequence="3">136 BOOK REVIEWS passages that quote the Bible in order to set up passages in which there is extensive and free rewriting; passages built around biblical figures using nonbiblical material; and passages with no counterparts in the Bible. On the whole, the prologue provides a good foundation for the detailed analysis of part II, where Murphy llustrates clearly what he establishes here, namely, that there is a larger plot in which the smaller episodic units work, and that it is driven by the theme of leadership. He amply illustrates each category of rewriting in the narrative commentary. Part II, the "Narrative Commentary," accounts for seven of the book's twelve chapters and provides a chapter-by-chapter analysis of all sixty-five chapters of Biblical Antiquities, divided as follows: chapter 3 "From Adam to Joseph: Biblical Antiquities 1-8"; chapter 4 "Moses: Biblical Antiquities 9-19"; chapter 5 "Joshua: Biblical Antiquities 20-24"; chapter 6 "Kenaz: Biblical Antiquities 25-29"; chapter 7 "Deborah: Biblical Antiquities 30-33"; chapter 8 "From Aod to the Ascension of Phinehas: Biblical Antiquities 34-48"; and chapter 9 "From Samuel to David: Biblical Antiquities 49-65." In this literary analysis Murphy brings out major themes and demonstrates in detail how Pseudo-Philo enhances the biblical text, departs from it, or ignores it altogether. He also shows how episodes are related to each other. Curiously, he never provides any structural overview of Biblical Antiquities, not even so much as a basic outline, even though he claims there is a structure which informs the whole work (p. 15). Even if the rewriting of the Bible is not significant with regard to the structure of Biblical Antiquities, that needs to be said in a literary commentary. Neither is any rationale offered for Murphy's own divisions of Biblical Antiquities, though some are obvious. Part III, "Broader Perspectives on Pseudo-Philo," presents a generalized picture of characters (chap. 10), themes (chap. 11), and reflections of the author's real world (chap. 12). Murphy discusses the major characters under the subheadings "God," "Humanity," "Israel," "Leaders (Good, Bad and In-Between)," and "Other Major Figures" ("who stand out but are not leaders"). God is the most important character, and unifies the narrative. The unifying element in all the characters is trust in God. Murphy's treatment of themes is designed to give some appreciation of topics most interesting to Pseudo-Philo, as a general entree to the work (p. 244). One wonders, then, why he did not place it before the narrative commentary. The specific themes covered here include "Covenant," "Moral Causality," "Plans and Plots," "Idolatry," and "Women." Murphy understands the covenant as a central symbol of Biblical Antiquities. Moral causality, the strict application</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 137 of the deuteronomic ideal that good is rewarded and evil punished, is a theme that permeates the work, so that every story illustrates it to some degree, as is convincingly demonstrated in part II. The primary concern of chapter 12, "The Real Author in Historical Context," is to see how Pseudo-Philo rewrote the Bible to actualize it for his contemporaries. Murphy concludes that Pseudo-Philo wished to convey that the covenant survives no matter what Israel does or suffers because it depends on the divine promises to the fathers. The moral causality propounded in Biblical Antiquities speaks to the work as a theodicy. Murphy's book fulfills its stated purpose as a narrative commentary. It is a good introduction for scholars in related fields who are unfamiliar with Biblical Antiquities. For students, Murphy's work will serve as a helpful companion to reading Biblical Antiquities. Since it is not a conventional commentary that deals directly with scholarly theories or secondary literature, those looking for such discussions will have to turn to works that Murphy himself built upon. Readers may be frustrated by this, but it is in keeping with Murphy's stated goals. The major strength of Murphy's treatment of Biblical Antiquities lies in his consistent plot and character analysis using the biblical text as a fixed point of comparison. Because Murphy focuses on the interrelation of episodic units and the interweaving of plot types, he elucidates both general problems of the overall narrative as well as specific matters in the rewritten biblical stories. One may find the chapter-by-chapter analysis a bit tedious at times, with its recurring themes and strands, but such analysis conveys exactly what Murphy would have us see: the whole forest and its trees. It is precisely by means of this comprehensive analysis, in which Murphy consistently and accurately points out intentional departures from the biblical story, that the varied illustrations and manifestations of themes and plot important to Pseudo-Philo's rewriting of the Bible are seen clearly, in each instance, in their interrelations, and in the context of the whole narrative. The major weakness of Murphy's book is organization. Given the nature of his treatment of Biblical Antiquities, it would have been more helpful to have placed part III before part II, and then to draw some summary conclusions thereafter, since part III gives a framework for reading through the detailed and long analysis contained in part II. Murphy recognizes the importance of historical questions and literary parallels, but did not treat such issues directly so as not to detract from his narrative analysis. While this is understandable, the reader's frustration at the relegation of these important</page><page sequence="5">138 BOOK REVIEWS matters mainly to footnotes could likewise have been minimized by placing the material in part III before part II. Of course one may simply read part III before part II. Admittedly, the difficult matter of confining the discussion to particular issues of narrative and literary technique for the sake of achieving the book's stated goal is adequately handled. Murphy uncritically adopts P. W. van der Horst's position that Pseudo- Philo was a "feminist" because he aggrandizes women; consequently he finds the treatment of women in Biblical Antiquities "truly noteworthy" (p. 258). It is misleading for him to claim, for example, that Pseudo-Philo's treatment of Deborah is a testimony to "his high regard for women and his determination to give them their rightful place in Israel's history" (p. 136). The uncritical basis for this claim is the number of chapters devoted to her as well as the fact that some of Pseudo-Philo's most important ideas are put on her lips (p. 136). Even though elsewhere Murphy carefully shows how important the theme of good leadership is, and that Pseudo-Philo's most important ideas are always put on the lips of leaders or God, he seems to forget here that Pseudo-Philo is interested in women, like men, only insofar as they are good or bad leaders. He enhances the biblical story about her no more or less than he does for comparable male leaders. Further, Murphy provides no evidence from Biblical Antiquities indicating that Pseudo-Philo was interested in women as women, let alone in giving them a place in history. Deborah is aggrandized precisely because she is an important judge and a fine example of Pseudo-Philo's paradigm of the good leader; she thereby earns four chapters. In short, Murphy overlooks here his own analysis that Pseudo-Philo aggrandizes the role and importance of any good leader. Yet in other episodes involving women, e.g., Jepthah-Seila, Murphy's treatment is even-handed and demonstrates that if Pseudo-Philo treats women to a greater degree than his contemporaries, it is not because he is a feminist, but because it suits his driving elements for plot and character. Murphy maintains that Pseudo-Philo rewrote the Bible so as to produce a version of the sacred stories that would be of use to his community in its own circumstances, but his reconstruction of these things is somewhat vague and disappointing, providing nothing new about the social-historical context to Biblical Antiquities as a result of such a careful literary analysis. Murphy frequently interests the reader in Pseudo-Philo's deliberate reversal of biblical data for a theological point, and one wishes he had more explicitly connected such observations to Pseudo-Philo's rewriting of the Bible. Moreover, in his introduction he might have briefly addressed the theology of Biblical</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 139 Antiquities, since his literary analysis presupposes a certain theology in the work and draws some theological conclusions. Murphy's style throughout is lucid, but his use of "human(s)" as a noun was distracting. The bibliography is a comprehensive one on Pseudo-Philo and includes some related works on the Pseudepigrapha as well as recent major works in literary and narrative criticism. Murphy also provides a "Concordance of Proper Names" and a "General Concordance," both based on Harrington's critical work, as well as an index of modem authors and a general index. The concordances will prove useful for future studies of Biblical Antiquities. Murphy is to be congratulated for providing a good introduction and companion to Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities. His commentary is an intelligent exposition of its major themes. His narrative conclusions are solidly rooted in a close familiarity with the text in all its parts and in the whole. His literary analysis comprehensively demonstrates the unity of plot, character, and themes of the individual episodes and the narrative as a whole, while offering an excellent understanding of how Pseudo-Philo rewrote the Bible. Murphy's commentary is a significant contribution to the understanding of Biblical Antiquities as a consistent and connected narrative.
