With these simple figures Gershon Hundert of McGill University reminds us that case studies of Polish towns are indispensable not only for appreciating the Jewish experience, but also for understanding fundamental issues in Polish history. The town he has chosen to study is Opat6w (Apt was its Jewish name), which lay to the northeast of Cracow, slightly more than halfway to Lublin. In 1770 Opat6w numbered around 4,000 residents, 2,500-3,000 of whom were Jewish. Its size might raise for some the question of the town's cultural and economic significance and the ability to draw any general conclusions from its experience. However, we should remember that in Poland-Lithuania, indeed in much of Eastern Europe, 4,000 residents made for a middle-sized town, and Opat6w's merchants traded with Gdarisk (Danzig), Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Breslau (Wroclaw), Ukraine, Belarus, and Turkey. The 2,500 or so Jews in Opat6w were hardly stagnating in a provincial backwater in the eighteenth century. An Opat6w native was rabbi in Cavaillon, France. The chief rabbi in Prague was the scion of the most powerful Jewish family in Opat6w, the Landaus, itself one of the fifteenth to twentieth preeminent families that made up the Jewish aristocracy in Poland. One rabbi of the Hambro synagogue in London was likely a Landau-in-law. Opat6w also was part of a network of scholars in Eastern Europe that had links with Padua. Intrepid Jews from the town in this period studied in Berlin and traveled to the Middle East, India, and even the American colonies. Quite simply, towns like Opat6w were the center of Jewish life and culture in Poland-Lithuania. A major theme in Hundert's study is Jewish communal institutions and the extent of their autonomy. Opat6w was one of the private towns that belonged to members of the Polish nobility, not a royal city subject to the crown. To attract Jewish settlers to such towns, the noble lord would grant them wide-ranging communal privileges and economic freedom, and effectively guarantee these rights against the protests of Christian burghers and the clergy. Hundert suggests that Jews in private towns, at least in the private town of Opat6w, were no worse off than in royal towns where the king was their protector, because the noble owner had tighter control over Christian guilds and the local church. On the other hand, the lord could intervene at will in communal affairs, and increasingly did so in the eighteenth century. In one instance a town owner suspended outright the</page><page sequence="3">270 BOOK REVIEWS qahal (Jewish governing council). But Hundert notes that this did not mean the demise of an autonomous Jewish community (qehillah), since the lord was acting on complaints lodged by ordinary Jewish burghers who resented the qahal's violations of fair election practices. Similarly we read of the intervention of a different owner, who tried to deny wealthy merchants seats on the qahal because of their abuses in administering taxes, and instead sought to have simple taxpaying burghers serve, without, Hundert adds, any success. Indeed, the owners' interference may have had the unintended effect of liberating individual Jews from the sometimes heavy-handed control of the qahal, while the social conflict between the governing council and the majority of the taxpaying Jews ultimately weakened the former. While the author uncovers no direct evidence of Beshtian Hasidism in the period he studies, still his detailed examination of Opat6w's organs of self-rule and justice is very instructive on the origins of both the Jewish Enlightenment and the Hasidic revival in Poland in the eighteenth century. A second theme, treated with equal insight, is the nature of Jewish identity within the larger Christian state. After the nobility, it was only the common- wealth's Jews who really saw themselves as Polish. Christian burghers defined themselves as members of a town, while villagers thought of themselves as "from here." Jews, however, were conscious members of a supraregional administrative entity, Poland-Lithuania, and identified themselves as Polish, not Ashkenazic (German) or Turkish, Jews. Moreover, the Christian and Jewish communities were hardly isolated from one another. Jews translated Hebrew documents into Polish, their courts heard cases between Poles and Jews, and, as one anecdote relates, there was an Opat6w Jew who could swear in Polish with the best of them. Under the old commonwealth, Hundert concludes, there was no monolithic Polish experience, and here we might ponder how early modern national consciousness(es) differed from later forms of nationalism. Hundert's findings on credit, trade, artisanal production, and demographic trends rest on painstaking archival research and provide original contributions to the economy of Poland-Lithuania under serfdom. Far from being the ubiquitous usurers, Opat6w's Jew did the borrowing, primarily from the church for long- term loans and from the nobility for short-term operating capital. And it was the richest, most prominent Jews who were most in debt, since they had the most developed business interests requiring ongoing infusions of cash. Here Hundert's work, like M. S. Rosman's recent book on the Jews on the Sieniawa estates in eighteenth-century Poland, goes well beyond Jewish</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 271 history. Significant sources of credit were available in the Polish economy, and the nobility invested their surplus income in commerce and production, not just in conspicuous consumption. Moreover, two-thirds of Opat6w's Jewish merchants engaged in local and regional trade. Such information revises the view that the manorial system, based on the unfree labor of serfs tied to the soil, and the international Baltic grain trade controlled directly by the nobility, caused the local market to contract and the native merchantry to atrophy. In point of fact, peasant-serfs sold grain and wool to Jews who in turn provided goods and services to nobles, burghers, and peasants. Nor were Opat6w's Jews just merchants; over one-third were artisans who produced for Jews and Christians alike. And while the number of Christian artisans fell in the eighteenth century, Jews engaged in handicrafts rose at such a rapid rate that Opat6w experienced a net increase in practicing artisans between 1721 and 1788. Demographic data emphatically underscore this trend; the Jewish population nearly tripled in the first seven decades of the eighteenth century. Here the reader is left asking one question. After 1770, Opat6w suffered economic and demographic reverses as Jews moved to surrounding villages or migrated to Warsaw, but the study does not elaborate why this out-migration occurred. Hundert's lesson is a stunning one. Rather than contributing to the decline of Polish-Lithuanian cities because of their competition with Christian guilds, as some historians have written, Jews represented a constituent part of city- building and prevented an ever further fall in Polish towns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. And the commercial infrastructure the Jews helped maintain could itself not have existed without a rural economy supplying resources and clients whose presence less sanguine studies have sometimes overlooked. Historians of East European Jewry will value this excellent analysis of an urban Jewish community on the eve of the great transformations at the end of the eighteenth century. And those primarily interested in the economic and social history of early modern Poland-Lithuania will learn from Hundert that to pass over the Jewish commercial role in linking town and countryside is to risk seriously misreading the Polish economy of the time.
