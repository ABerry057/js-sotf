<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Morell. Precedent and Judicial Discretion: The Case of Joseph ibn Lev. South Florida Studies in the History of Judaism 26. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991. xii, 213 pp. R. Joseph Ibn Lev was a leading rabbinic figure in sixteenth-century Turkey who was held in high regard by his peers. He lived for a time in Salonika and later served as the head of a yeshivah in Constantinople. In addition to composing talmudic novellae, Ibn Lev was the author of close to three hundred seventy responsa, of which more than ninety percent were published in his lifetime. His responsa deal with a wide variety of topics and many are quite intricate. They constitute a valuable source for aspects of the social and economic history of Turkish Jewry in this period, dealing with such intriguing issues as the status of conversos as witnesses, business relationships with the Ottoman authorities, the effects of unsuccessful medical procedures on family life, taxation of rabbinic scholars, the use of the Samson-nazirite vow as a</page><page sequence="2">214 BOOK REVIEWS means of protecting a commitment, and maritime travel, trade, and insurance, to name but a few. In Precedent and Judicial Discretion, Samuel Morell has highlighted a suggestive cross-section of Ibn Lev's responsa through careful translation and deft analysis. He also has made meaningful strides toward discovering and charting the juridical considerations that motivated Ibn Lev to rule in the ways that he did. To date, a relatively small amount of published research has focused on patterns of judicial discretion and attitudes toward precedent within medieval and early modem responsa literature. Morell delineates the terms and concepts by which Ibn Lev sought to overcome his professed sense of inadequacy as a decisor. Morell shows that even as Ibn Lev maintained that he could not himself decide between competing halakhic positions embraced by the greatest scholars of earlier generations, he developed legal strategies and means of categorization which allowed him to rule according to his own sense of the law and his un- derstanding and assessment of the realities of a situation. Ibn Lev's quietly innovative use of jurisprudential methods such as senifim, the qim li argument, and sefeq sefeqa, afforded him additional judicial flexibility that belied his self-proclaimed shortcomings as a jurist. Morell's discussions and analyses of Ibn Lev's responsa reflect a fine mastery of talmudic literature and a clear sensitivity to the nuances of rabbinic legal theory. It is possible at times to suggest an alternate approach toward understanding Ibn Lev's rulings. For example: In cases of ineffective or invalid bills of divorce, might Ibn Lev's desire to minimize confusion regarding marital status (similar to his desire to release 'agunot noted by Morell, pp. 62-63, 95-98) be as significant a consideration in his ruling as the reasons suggested by Morell (pp. 12, 76, 98-99)? In several scattered comments, Morell points to the rabbinic origins of Ibn Lev's generally self-effacing posture toward halakhic decision-making. In Morell's view, Ibn Lev was influenced by late medieval Ashkenazic scholars, especially R. Israel Isserlein (author of Terumat ha-Deshen) and R. Joseph Colon (Mahariq). Due to both the vicissitudes of their time and their (self-)perceived place in rabbinc history, the Ashkenazic rabbis displayed a pronounced degree of what Morell (following Yedidyah Dinari, HIakhmei Ashkenaz be-Shilhei Yemei ha-Beinayim (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 34-40) characterizes as yir 'at ha-hora'ah. This feeling impeled them toward the validation of principles like qim li (whereby the defendant in a civil suit</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 215 expressed his reliance on an existing rabbinic opinion that would exonerate him, and the plaintiff had to then prove that the law was not according to that view) which diminished a decisor's independence. Morell is uncertain as to why this Ashkenazic mode of thought impacted upon Sefardic decisors of the sixteenth century. He notes several other instances (particularly in the realm of communal government) in which Sefardic rabbis of Turkey, including Ibn Lev and R. Samuel de Medina (Maharashdam), appear to have been influenced by positions of Maharam mi-Rothenburg, Terumat ha-Deshen, and Mahariq. Further study is necessary in order to evaluate the nature and extent of this influence. In the seventy-five or so responsa of Ibn Lev that are presented and analysed by Morell, the final ruling remains at odds with most of the halakhic views of Maharam mi-Rothenburg, Terumat ha-Deshen, and Mahariq that Ibn Lev had cited.' Ibn Lev discussed the position of Maharam and Mahariq on the need for unanimity in communal government and, as Morell has demonstrated in an earlier article,2 even appropriated a phrase and concept that had been coined by Maharam. And yet, Ibn Lev (as well as Maharashdam) always sided with those (Sefardic) authorities who held that majority rules, just as he appied Maharam's concept in a different manner than it was intended. Furthermore, Ibn Lev's use of hilkheta ke-batra'e, which Morell suggests followed the Ashkenazic usage of that principle, appears to be utilized in a more limited context. It also should be noted that fifteenth-century Ashkenazic authorities formulated and maintained strong reservations against serving as judges and ruling decisively primarily in regard to monetary law. They were far less hesitant to issue their own rulings in cases involving marital or ritual law. Moreover, major medieval Sefardic decisors from Ri Megash to Rashba (whose views are cited frequently by Ibn Lev) consistently expressed their fealty to precedent and their inability to choose between earlier authorities, in formulations and with overtones that certainly could have impacted upon Ibn 1. Ibn Lev endorsed a lenient ruling of Isserlein (p. 158) in a case that involved the identification of a corpse which, in an 'agunah situation, is to be expected in any event. Note also Ibn Lev's reliance on Mahariq in cases of 'agunot, described by Morell in his article "Profile of a Jurist: Joseph Ibn Lev's Rulings Regarding Agunot," The Jewish Law Annual 9 (1990): 177, 180, 182. 2. "The Constitutional Limits of Communal Government in Rabbinic Law," Jewish Social Studies 33 (1971): 113-18.</page><page sequence="4">216 BOOK REVIEWS Lev. To be sure, Ibn Lev does cite formulatios of Maharam mi-Rothenburg, Terumat ha-Deshen, and Mahariq as models for the use and application of the qim li argument. Nonetheless, definitive conclusions about influences on the full range of Ibn Lev's halakhic methodologies can be reached only after a discussion of Ibn Lev's relationship with earlier Sefardic authorities. The analyses and conclusions of Precedent and Judicial Discretion en- gender a number of other issues for consideration in future research. In his final paragraph, Morell writes that "[Ibn Lev] and his contemporaries stood astride a turning point in history. .. Ibn Lev is a worthy representative of that generation." It would be worthwhile to correlate Ibn Lev's halakhic methodologies with those of his contemporaries, at least with better-known and accessible figures such as R. Yosef Caro and Radbaz (each of whom is referred to by Morell in this volume in only a handful of instances). 3 Also, one wonders about whether there is any manifestation in Ibn Lev's responsa of overarching trends in legal orientation, of the kind raised by a tradition recorded in Hida's Shem ha-Gedolim (ma'arekhet sefarim, s.v. Beit Yosef). According to this tradition, Ibn Lev was initially opposed to Caro's Beit Yosefbecause its encyclopedic nature would dissuade students from wrestling with the underlying talmudic and rabbinic texts, but later changed his mind precisely because he found the Beit Yosef to be such an important resource for the development of talmudic law. In Precedent and Judicial Discretion, Morell has provided a well- constructed window into a body of literature and its methodologies that have not been treated adequately in modern scholarship. It is hoped that he and perhaps others will take up the challenge of further research in order to present a larger and more comprehensive picture.
