<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RECALL OF RABBI NEHUNIAH BEN HA-QANAH FROM ECSTASY IN THE HEKHALOT RABBATI* By LAWRENCE H. SCHIFFMAN New York University In his lewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradi- tion,' Professor G. Scholem has pointed to the conformity of the hekhalot texts, "even in the most minute detail, to halakhic Judaism and its pre- scriptions." 2 TO illustrate this observation, Scholem cites the description of the calling back of Rabbi Nehuniah ben Ha-Qanah3 from ecstasy. Rabbi Nehuniah is sitting, as it were, before the divine throne describing the hekhalot to his pupils who are transcribing his words. A problem arises regarding Rabbi Nehuniah's language in describing the gate-keepers of the sixth hekhal.4 In order to clarify this problem, the pupils ask Rabbi IshmaePl to recall Rabbi Nehuniah to normal consciousness so that they * Dr. Menahem H. Schmelzer, Librarian of the Jewish Theological Seminary, was kind enough to make available to me the manuscripts and microfilms necessary for this study. (Mrs.) Susan Young, research assistant at the Seminary library, was most helpful in this regard. 1.

The following manuscript collections of hekhalot texts were compared for our study: JTS 828, Munich 22 and 40, Kaufmann 238, Vat. Ebr. 228, Oxford, Neubauer 1531 (Michael 9). Selected variants (not including the final poem) appear in the following notes. Reproducing all variants would not be the best procedure since these MSS. contain many errors and differences in orthography which, in light of the state of these texts, are often not useful for philological study. A thorough linguistic study of the hekhalot manuscripts would be very useful. 7. The omission of f'9l" in Mun. 40 results from haplography with '~t] , which looks almost the same in this script.

SCHIFFMAN 271 Scholem provides us with the draft of an English translation of this passage prepared by Professor Morton Smith:20 Immediately I took a piece of very fine woolen cloth and gave it to R. Akiba, and R. Akiba gave it to a servant of ours saying: "Go and lay this cloth beside a woman who immersed herself a second time.2' For if that woman will come and will declare the circum- stances of her menstrual flow22 before the company, there will be one who forbids her to her husband and the majority will permit. Say to that woman: 'Touch this cloth with the end of the middle finger of your hand, and do not press23 the end of your finger upon it, but rather as a man who takes a hair which had fallen therein from his eyeball, pushing it very gently.'" They went and did so, and laid the cloth before R. Ishmael. He inserted into it a bough24 of myrtle full of oil25 that had been soaked in pure balsam and they 18. Kauf. preserves the Palestinian form in which the prefix 9V is attached to the following word. The readings Mun. 22: i1 ~ V and JTS: it' ,"I are clearly errors resulting from incorrect division of the old Palestinian form followed by con- fusion of 0 and 0. 19. Vat., Kauf., and Mun. 40 read: "11 . 20. While the full translation was never published, cf. Smith's analysis in "Observa- tions on Hekhalot Rabbati," Biblical and Other Studies, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1963), p. 145. 21. Such a use of the hifeil is otherwise unattested. Normal meaning of the hifcil is "to immerse" (something or someone). This form requires a direct object. Can this be an imperative, sing., masc., hatbelah, "immerse her"? I cannot see how such a form would fit into the context. 22. The phrase middat westah is otherwise unattested. Shicur weset, occurring several times in the Babylonian Talmud, is not relevant. See J. Levy, Wirterbuch iiber die Talmudim und Midraschim (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1963), I, 49, s.v. awti'os. On the use of weset as a halakhic term, see "Weset," 'Ensiqlopediya Talmudit, 11 (Jerusalem, 1965) 501-588. 23. The roots nge and drs are both terms for contact which may produce ritual impurity.

In conclusion Scholem writes: What is important here is not the set of fictitious circumstances attending this procedure, but, rather, the cumulative effect of all these provisions, demonstrating that even the slightest possible suspicion of impurity, defined according to the strictest rabbinic law, is enough to have the ecstatic dismissed from before the throne. Examples of this attitude abound in these texts, affirming the fact that their writers lived near the center of rabbinic Judaism, not on its fringes.26 There are two aspects to this procedure. First is the matter of the im- purity, a halakhic problem. We shall see that Professor Smith's translation has obscured an essential aspect of this procedure. Second is the magical praxis associated with this procedure, the use of myrtle, oil of foliatum, and balsam, which will show again the important relationship between hekhalot texts and the early Jewish magical tradition. I. RITUAL PURITY AND RABBI NEHUNIAH'S DESCENT Our understanding of this passage requires a clarification of two tech- nical expressions. Based on the examination of five manuscripts, we read matlit shel mela parheba.27 Mela parheba occurs only in B. Niddah 17a in the context of discussion of M. Niddah 2:4 requiring that a man and woman examine themselves with a cloth (ced) after sexual relations to be sure the woman has not had an emission of blood, which would render her ritually impure28 and disqualify her from handling pure food. The 26. Gnosticism, pp. 11 f. 27. See above, n. 7. 28. The Mishnah records a debate between the houses of Hillel and Shammai. Commentators are divided as to the exact meaning of the opinions. See Ch.

SCHIFFMAN 273 Talmud29 states that there were three things for which the royal house of Monobazus (II of Adiabene) was praised.30 One is that they examined their beds (a euphemism for the sexual organs)31 with mela parheba.32 The use of the root bdq for examination indicates that the Talmud is speaking here of an examination in which the cloth is inserted internally by the woman.33 Various definitions of mela parheba are possible. Rashi34 cites two, Provengal coton" and soft, clean wool.36 Regardless, it is clear that this was a soft, white cloth on which even the most minute presence of blood would be detected. 29. The passage is preceded by the formula ta shemac, "come and hear," which can precede both tannaitic and amoraic statements. In view of the fact that all the traditions regarding Monobazus appear in tannaitic collections or can be shown to reach back into the tannaitic period, we can assume that our text is actually a baraita. Further, our statement is referred to in the amoraic discussion with the formula qatane, "he teaches," which should only refer to a tannaitic statement. The conversion of the royal family of Adiabene took place in the reign of Claudius, 41-54 C.E. The traditions from Josephus and the tannaim are all set in the Temple period. We can assume that Monobazus II would have ruled before 70, so our tradi- tions are probably dated to the first century. Cf. E. Schiirer, A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1891) II, ii, 309-311 and notes. Rabbinic citations are collected in J. Theodor and Ch. Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabba (Jerusalem: Wahrman, 1965) I, 467, n. 4. The reading bet yannai found in Vat. MS. 111 to B. Niddah 17a is corrected to bet munbaz in a second hand between the lines. It should be noted that this is generally a poor MS. I cannot locate the phrase bet yannai in Rabbinic literature. 30. Heb. mazkirin 'otan le-shebaht. The same phrase occurs regarding Monobazus (II) in T. Kippurim 2:3. 31. See B. Shabbat 62b (and R. N. Rabbinovicz, Diqduqe Soferim [Munich, 1875], ad loc.), B. Qiddushin 71a, where mittah perhaps has this meaning. All six occur- rences of the root bdq with mittah in the Babylonian Talmud occur on our page in Niddah. I could locate no other use of this phrase. 32. This is the reading of MSS. Munich, Vat. 113, Bodleian 375 (Michael 15), and eds. Soncino, 1489, Venice, 1520. Vatican 111 reads K~,I/1D K1~' (/= new line) and K:lD K' .?3 33. On this procedure, see "Bediqat 'Ishah," Ensiqlopediya Talmudit 2 (Jerusalem, 1952), 336-343. For some reason this technical usage of bdq has not been mentioned in the Rabbinic dictionaries of Kohut, Levy, or Jastrow. 34. Commentary to B. Niddah 17a, s.v. mela parheba.

For various etymologies of mela and parheba, see cArukh Ha-Shalem V, 145 f., IX, 255 f., 337; Levy, III, 101, IV, 228. None of these is very convincing.</page><page sequence="6">274 RECALL OF RABBI NEHUNIAH BEN HA-QANAH Our passage in Hekhalot Rabbati contains another technical expression, tabelah we-lo caletah lah tebilah. Almost the same expression is used in B. Niddah 67a where it describes the problem of hasisah, "interposition." 37 Interposition refers to the presence of an intervening substance on the body of a woman which invalidates her immersion (tebilah) in a ritual bath (miqweh). She may then be described as "one who has immersed but whose immersion has not been successful." We may now propose a new interpretation for the first part of our pas- sage. Rabbi Ishmael took a piece of cloth appropriate for a woman's internal examination and gave it to a servant. He had him give the cloth to a woman whose first immersion had been invalidated because of an interposition, but who had immersed a second time. (There should be no question of the woman's purity.) This should be a woman, however, about whom a minor question still exists regarding the fixing of her menstrual cycle. This question would involve the date when her period began and ended, and, hence, the correct date of her immersion, such that one opinion would still forbid her to have relations with her husband even after im- mersing twice. She is to use this cloth for the bediqah, the internal exami- nation. The servant is told to instruct this woman to touch the cloth lightly and not to press too hard. Apparently, the cloth was to be wrapped around the middle finger and inserted with the least pressure possible. It is this cloth which, together with the magical praxis to be discussed below, brings Rabbi Nehluniah back. The principle operating is one of the least possible impurity. Here we have a woman pure in that she immersed twice, about whom one rigorist might say she is impure. She inserts the cloth but does so with as little pressure as possible to avoid the cloth's contracting impurity by coming in contact with blood. Yet this minute possibility of ritual impurity, when 37. We-tabelah we-caletah, lo caletah lah tebilah. Quoted by Rabbi Giddel in the name of Rav (Abba Arika) the first-generation Babylonian amora (d. 247 C.E., Strack, p. 121). For the connection of his academy with mystical speculation see M. Beer, "Rav," EJ 13 (1971), 1578, and Scholem, Gnosticism, pp. 27 f. Cf. also the words of R. Johanan (third-cent. Palestinian amora) on that same page. This is the reading of MSS. Munich, Vat. 111 (which, however, adds an entire clause and so repeats our expression), Bodleian 375, eds. Soncino, 1489 and Venice, 1520. For variants, see also Tosfe Ha-Rosh, Rabbenu HIananel (quoted in Tosafot) and cArukh Ha-Shalem I, 33, s.v. 'adwara. It is noteworthy that according to Ritba, ad loc., the interposition described by our expression (lo caletah lah tebilah) is de-rabbanan, a Rabbinical ordinance. Cf. also B. Shabbat 16b, (ebilah .. . colah lah, in regard to the immersion of vessels (the words of Rava, 299-352 C.E. [Strack, p. 130] ).</page><page sequence="7">LAWRENCE H. SCHIFFMAN 275 applied to R. Nelhuniah together with the proper praxis, causes him to be dismissed from before the chariot-throne. The requirement of ritual purity is also associated with the rites for conjuring the Prince of the Torah (sar ha-torah),38 a practice the magical aspects of which are obvious. The purification involves fasting, abstaining from sexual relations, immersion, and, most notably, preparing one's own food.39 The last provision has the purpose of shielding the food from contact with women (the usual preparers of food).4? Otherwise, if the woman were impure or (as in our text) of doubtful status, the impurity would be contracted by the food and render the man who ate it impure. This, of course, would prevent his attaining the vision or the appearance of the Prince of the Torah. Such purification is also important in early Jewish and Hellenistic magical traditions.41 II. THE MAGICAL PRAXIS While the halakhic background of our passage is certainly clear, the cloth which has contracted minimal impurity is used within a magical rite to cause R. Ne1huniah's return. Apparently, the cloth, without the attendant praxis, would not have brought about the desired result. According to our passage, R. Ishmael takes the cloth and inserts into it a bough of myrtle full of oil of foliatum soaked (sharuy) in pure balsam. The cloth, wrapped around the bough, is placed on the lap of R. Nehuniah, characteristically sitting for the mystical vision.42 It is this series of magical acts which results in R. Nehuniah's dismissal from before the throne of glory. 38.

Neusner, A History of the Jews in Babylonia V (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), 370. 44. According to some Talmudic commentators, the "inquirer" (sho'el) incurred substantially less guilt than the necromancer (coseh) ("cOb," Ensiqlopediya Talmudit 1 [Jerusalem, 1951], 115). Nevertheless, like many other practices in the Sefer Ha- Razim, this was certainly forbidden by halakhah. 45. For 'l with 'ob, see Deut. 18:11, 1 Chron. 10:13. (The appearance of I'l and dry' in the latter passage seems to be the result of conflation of synonymous variants.) 46. Margaliot notes that this detail appears in Rabad to Maimonides' H. cAbodah Zarah 6:1 and is disputed by Joseph Karo's Kesef Mishneh and Shem Tob b. Abraham b. Gaon Ha-Sefaradi's Migdal cOz. This opposition is based on the account of the witch of En-Dor in which no such indication occurs. 47. These names appear in lines 151-8. 48. The root bll is primarily a cultic term in the Bible referring to the mixing of a solid with oil. Cf. "a bowl filled with a mixture of honey and wine" (Goodenough, p. 200). 49. Gk. kt~&amp;xi may be a "broad flat bowl or saucer for drinking or pouring libations" (H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, revised and aug- mented throughout by H. S. Jones and R.

Brand, Kele Ha-Heres Be-Sifrut Ha-Talmud (Jerusalem: Mossad Ha-Rav Kook, 1953), pp. 427 f., for a thorough survey of the use of this term in Rabbinic literature. Significant is its use in cultic context. 50. Margaliot quotes Prof. Morton Smith who identified this as Gk. KpLok6poS , "bearing a ram," an epithet of Hermes (Liddell and Scott, p. 996b). Cf. R.

Here the myrtle functions as a magic wand. This same function is known from Greek magical literature.58 The liquids-oil and honey-remain in the bowl until the spell is to be broken. Nevertheless, we have an instance in which the praxis consists of using a bough of myrtle and two liquids, one an oil. The method of releasing the "ghost" is simply the reversal of the rites which brought him up. This is a common way of releasing magical spells. This praxis does, however, keep the liquids separate from the myrtle. A second passage from this magical treatise is also illuminating.59 .... ntv T~n u 7v 5Y 7'~ ;n~n 51.

There can be no question in light of the passages cited from the Sefer Ha-Razim and H.arba De-Mosheh that the cloth used for bediqah in the Hekhalot Rabbati functions as part of a magical praxis. An interesting parallel regarding the two liquids mentioned in our text from the Hekhalot Rabbati may be cited. In a fragment which is an addi- tion to the Hekhalot Zutarti72 we read: And in the seventh hekhal wheels of light pour foliatum and pure balsam. And a double wheel73 sounds the shofar (teqicah, terucah, teqicah) saying: Everyone who is worthy to see the King in His beauty, let him enter and see. The continuation describes the welcome given by the heavenly hosts to one who is worthy. We can only assume that the foliatum and balsam are poured by the angels over the initiate. They must have been intended as a purification prior to seeing the final vision of the chariot-throne in the seventh hekhal. While it is true that the use of oil is not known as a purification in Rab- binic law, its use for such purposes in a work of this type is not surprising." The need for this final purification ceremony would be to insure the 72. I. Gruenwald, "Qetacim Hadashim Mi-Sifrut Ha-Hekhalot," Tarbiz XXXVIII (1968-9), 370, n. 48, from MS. Oxford, Neubauer 1531, fol. 44r (=-MS. JTS 828, fol. 23v). 73. "Wheels of light" and "double wheel" are angelic designations. 74. Interesting in this connection are the 'aggadot regarding the river of balsam in Paradise. According to one late version, the souls of the pious are immersed (for purification) in 248 rivers of balsam before entering Paradise. See Seder Gan cEden in Jellinek, II, 52 (and parallels cited by L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1968], V, 29, n. 79, 31, n. 90), Midrash Konen in Jellinek, II, 29 (cf. Ginzberg, Legends, V, 125, n. 134). According to the Seder Gan cEden, "They put eight myrtles in his hand . . . and they lead him to a place full of rivers, surrounded by eight-hundred kinds of roses and myrtles" (So Ginzberg, Legends, I, 19 f.). According to Seder Rabbah Di-Bereshit, ed. Wertheimer I, sec. 41, p. 42 and sec. 42, p. 43, streams of pure balsam await the righteous for the future (le-catid la-bo), and the dew of balsam will be used to resurrect the dead.

Otherwise, his life or sanity might be in danger. We can now inquire about the purpose of these oils in the text from the Hekhalot Rabbati. In this praxis, bringing together halakhic and magi- cal aspects, the function of the oils is to limit further the degree of im- purity attendant to the cloth. Otherwise, Rabbi Nehuniah would be en- dangered by the introduction of too strong an impurity. The impure person who attempted to ascend to the merkabah would have suffered a horrible fate at the hands of the angels ready to welcome the worthy75 but to pounce upon the unworthy.'76 Therefore, Rabbi Ishmael desires to introduce enough impurity to bring about Rabbi Nehuniah's dismissal without causing him any harm. The praxis, then, attempts progressively to limit the impurity to the smallest degree. This study began with the assumption that the praxis described by the Hekhalot Rabbati is magical. It remains to say that magic may be defined as an attempt to influence the heavenly powers against their will.7 In the text under discussion, the praxis has the purpose of forcing the angels, who eagerly look forward to the coming of a worthy visionary, to release Rabbi Nehuniah from the spell he has imposed upon himself through the recital of the appropriate hymns.7" Further, when the impurity is introduced so that Rabbi Nehuniah no longer belongs before the chariot-throne, the magical praxis seeks to restrain the angels from taking punitive action against an impure visionary who has penetrated their inner sanctum. The praxis, then, is aimed primarily at the gate-keepers of the heavenly palaces. One might wonder why the clarification of Rabbi Neh.uniah's words was important enough to justify the risks involved in introducing impurity during his merkabah vision. The answer is supplied by the pseudo-histori- cal framework in which the account of the seven heavens is set." It was the threat of Roman destruction and death that led Rabbi Nehuniah to 75. See, for example, the addition to Hekhalot Zutarti quoted above, and Hekhalot Rabbati, ed. Wertheimer, p. 100, Jellinek, p. 98, Smith, p. 146. 76. For the dangers of the ascent, see Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 51-3. 77. Goodenough, II, 155-161. 78. Smith, 142, identifies the shirot, literally "songs," as spells, like the Latin carmina or Gk. epoidai. "They enable their possessor not only to ascend to the highest heaven and see the Throne but also to know the future and the secrets of men's minds and of the past; they secure for him Divine protection and assure that his enemies will be blasted." 79.

This sense of emergency made it necessary to chance the interruption of the vision. Without a thorough understanding of the material, Rabbi Nehuniah's traditions would have been of little value to those whom he wanted to initiate. The text that has been studied here demonstrates again that the hekhalot and magical literatures must be studied together if we are to attain a full understanding of either. Further, evidence from the Hellenistic magical tradition must be given sufficient attention. This is true not only for "esoteric" Jewish texts, but for many passages in Talmudic and Midrashic literature as well. Most important, this study shows that while Scholem is correct in his assertion that there is a halakhic element in the hekhalot texts, that element is often modified and even transmogrified by the context in which it appears. Only careful philological analysis can bring it to the surface. Additional Note to Sefer Ha-Razim 1:176-186, PP. 76 f. (above, pp. 276f.). The method for inquiring of an 'ob described here bears striking similarities to that practiced by the ancient Hittites. See. H. A. Hoffner, Jr., "Second Millennium Antecedents to the Hebrew "OB,"' JBL LXXXVI (1967), 385-401, and "'ob," Theologisches Worterbuch zum Alten Testament, Band I, Lieferung 2, ed. G. J. Botterweck, H. Ringgren (Stuttgart: K. Kohlhammer, 1971), pp. 141-45. Hoffner shows convincingly that the biblical 'ob is to be interpreted in light of the Hittite evidence. Similarities between the Hittite practice and that of Sefer Ha-Razim are: The Hittites often performed the ritual at a grave; so also Sefer Ha-Razim. Both rituals involve food offerings, and both use oil and honey, although the Hittites also used additional foods. While the rituals are by no means identical, it is certain that our text from the Sefer Ha-Razim preserves an ancient Near Eastern ritual that has been overlaid with Jewish and Hellenistic magical elements.</page></plain_text>
