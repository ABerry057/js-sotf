<plain_text><page sequence="1">226 BOOK REVIEWS Carmi Horowitz. The Jewish Sermon in 14th Century Spain. The Derashot of R. Joshua ibn Shu'eib. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989. ix, 206 pp. In the first decade of the fourteenth century, texts relating to the conflict over the study of philosophy bristled with complaints about the content of sermons delivered by philosophically oriented Jews. Late in that century, the great halakhist and philosopher Hasdai Crescas was reportedly preach- ing "publicly in the synagogues that the Messiah was born in Cisneros, in the kingdom of Castile."' During the intervening decades, there is every reason to believe that Iberian Jews delivered weekly sermons in their synagogues, and that these sermons would serve as valuable evidence for Jewish history, literature, and thought. Yet few such preachers are actually known to us, and someone search- ing for an account in English (beyond a few lines in the Encyclopaedia Judaica) of Jewish preaching in the fourteenth century would, until recently, have been totally stymied. The standard work on the subject, Israel Bettan's Studies in Jewish Preaching: The Middle Ages (Cincinnati, 1939), leaps from Bahya ben Asher at the end of the thirteenth century to Isaac Arama at the end of the fifteenth. A major step toward filling this lacuna has been taken by Carmi Horo- witz in his fine monograph on the sermons of Rabbi Joshua ibn Shu'eib. Disciple of the Rashba and teacher of Menahem ben Zerah (author of Seidah la-Derekh), member of a prominent family in Tudela, ibn Shu'eib left behind a precious collection of his Sabbath and festival sermons. Like most extant Jewish sermons from the Middle Ages, these texts contain little that illuminates the biography or personality of the preacher, and virtually noth- ing that reflects upon discrete historical events. Their value is primarily as a model of Jewish homiletical art in a period from which few examples remain, and as evidence for the material a Jewish community could expect to hear from the pulpit at Sabbath services: an abundance of aggadic mid- rashim (including some known from no other source), popularized philoso- phical teachings, and-perhaps most surprisingly-frequent references to kabbalistic doctrines. After reviewing the little that is known about ibn Shu'eib's life and 1. Y.

The heart of the book is an analysis of the derashot as a source for Jewish intellectual history. Not that ibn Shu'eib was an original thinker; Horowitz characterizes him, properly, as "popular and eclectic" (p. 90). But precisely because ibn Shu'eib was not on the cutting edge of Jewish thought, because he lacked profundity, because he wrote not for an intellectual elite but for the Jewish community as a whole, his ser- mons tell us something we cannot learn from the products of more powerful minds. Horowitz provides an illuminating account of ibn Shu'eib's social thought, revealing the preacher as a rather conservative defender of the oligarchic communal self-government who used his pulpit to respond to popular protest movements, and to polemicize against extreme forms of asceticism and the repudiation of wealth per se. He then discusses ibn Shu'eib's treatment of the classical problems of medieval Jewish intellectual history: the proper role of philosophy, the reasons for the commandments, the nature of prayer, the aggadah, exile and redemption. He also analyzes ibn Shu'eib's use of kabbalistic material, significant because these sermons are the only known example before the sixteenth century for the regular use of Kabbalah in a homiletical context. The book ends with a rather unexpectedly modest disclaimer: "A com- plete integrative treatment of ibn shu'eib as a darshan, popularizer and thinker remains a desideratum which this study will, I hope, begin to fill" (p. 187). Horowitz's book is substantially more than just a beginning. However, as an unfinished but unspecified agenda is implied by the author, it might not be amiss to suggest some lines for further research. First, in characteriz- ing the aesthetic and rhetorical dimensions of the sermons, Horowitz notes that "only by reading a full derashah can the careful synchronization of all its elements be conveyed" (p. 28). But this is not done, even in the discussion of sermon structure, and the rest of the book is organized by subjects of Jewish thought, integrating passages from various sermons that illuminate a particular intellectual problem. As a result, the reader may never attain a clear conception of what any one sermon by ibn Shu'eib was actually like. Horowitz shows himself fully aware of the methodological problems in deriving systematic thought from a preacher, whose units of discourse were not originally intended as chapters in a unified book but as discrete literary entities in which the rhetorical, exegetical, and didactic elements interact</page><page sequence="3">228 BOOK REVIEWS dynamically. But the aesthetic dimension gets relatively short shrift in this treatment, although literary questions may be critical for larger issues. Horowitz asserts that the derashot are "a bold attempt to popularize Kab- balah by integrating it into the very fabric of the sermon" (p. 30), noting that the kabbalistic allusions could not have been added to the written version because they are "an integral part of the structure of the sermon" (p. 30, n. 57). But this can be demonstrated only by detailed literary analysis of several sermons in their individual integrity, a task that remains to be done. Second is the comparative dimension. Considerably more attention is devoted to precise investigation of the sources of ibn Shu'eib's ideas than to the sources of his preaching technique. There are so few collections of Jewish sermons from the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries that it is a shame not to bring all the evidence to bear. We are told that "we have no sermons per se of R. Jonah [Gerondi]" (p. 26), despite the book published in 1980 as Derashot u-Ferushei Rabbenu Yonah, which does not appear in the biblio- graphy; whether or not these were actually the work of Gerondi, they are certainly sermons from the mid-thirteenth century that bear comparison with ibn Shu'eib's. Even more important is the collection in British Library Add. MS 27, 292, a set of sermons on the Torah lessons and holidays written by a disciple of R. Asher ben Yehiel, and thus an exact contemporary of ibn Shu'eib. Only by examining all this material together can we begin to under- stand what is unusual and what is conventional in ibn Shu'eib's homiletical oeuvre. As for the influence of contemporary Christian preaching on ibn Shu'eib and his colleagues, this large and important subject has scarcely been broached. Finally, I must report that the book would be even more valuable if the indices had been prepared more carefully. Both the index of names and the subject index are manifestly incomplete, and the absence of an index to bib- lical verses and rabbinic passages discussed in the text diminishes its useful- ness for comparative purposes. Yet despite these demurrals, Horowitz's study is a major addition to the literature available on medieval Jewish preaching and popular Jewish culture. A dozen more such monographs on other preachers might bring us close to the time when a true history of medieval Jewish preaching could be contemplated.
