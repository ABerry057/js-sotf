<plain_text><page sequence="1">Azariah de' Rossi. The Light of the Eyes. Translated with introduction and anno- tations by Joanna Weinberg. Yale Judaica Series. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001. xlix, 802 pp. The central dimension of Azariah de' Rossi's complex and diverse treatise, Me'or 'einayim, is undoubtedly what Joanna Weinberg describes as "his real con- tribution to critical scholarship" (p. xxix), and this is especially evident in his in- novative chapters on Philo, rabbinic aggadah and Jewish chronology. De' Rossi's studies are compounded by ponderous Hebrew prose replete with citations, proof- texts, references, and allusions. Nevertheless, Weinberg skillfully makes this clas- sic manageable in English. Her abundant notes clarify the classical Jewish texts he addressed and the innumerable Jewish and non-Jewish sources from antiquity to the sixteenth century integral to his scholarly endeavor. The translation is also com- plemented by a comprehensive index of sources. Me'or ceinayim occupies a unique place in the sixteenth-century age of Jew- ish historiographical creativity, not least by virtue of the negative reaction it gen- erated. That the Maharal of Prague was unrestrained in his castigation of de' Rossi's critical, historically driven scrutiny of aggadah, would have been expected, but re- ception to his work by some prominent Italian Jewish dignitaries was also vehe- ment. These included signatories to the 1574 ban of Me'or Ceinayim which required the would-be reader or owner of the book to first obtain rabbinic permission. Even Weinberg, who subscribes to the view that the initial participants to the ban "were minor authorities," acknowledges, albeit in a footnote, that Yehiel Nissim da Pisa "one of the signatories for Ferrara, was an important communal leader and erudite 200</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews scholar" (p. xliii n.158). Given da Pisa's objection to earlier rationalistic exposi- tion of aggadah and his emphasis on its secret meaning, his participation in the ban against "discourses which our pious ancestors could not have imagined" as the text stated, is hardly surprising. Another signatory was Yehiel Trabot of Pesaro, a leading halakhic decisor, who years later while overseeing Hebrew books prior to their printing, referred to certain published works that should have been hidden or thrown into the fire along with their authors. He very likely had de' Rossi in mind. The highly cultured Judah Moscato raised theological considerations in his cau- tionary response to de' Rossi's unconventional views regarding creation era chronology and the Jewish calendrical system, while Moscato's distinguished rab- binic contemporary in Mantua, Moses Provencal, vigorously addressed this in a lengthy hasagah. It is true as Weinberg points out, that "Provenzali did not articu- late his dissent in a polemical vein" (p. xliii), but given de' Rossi's forthright de- nial of the ostensibly Mosaic or even pre-Mosaic age of that system and its divine authority, Provencal's hasagah, despite the niceties of his relationship with de' Rossi, significantly transcended what Weinberg calls simply "the form of a schol- arly exchange" (p. xliii). Moreover, the late-eighteenth-century Italian rabbi Ha- nanel Neppi, who had occasion to consult an entire manuscript of Provencal's hasagot to Me'or Ceinayim, described how Provencal fulminated against many prin- cipal aspects of the work, notably the characterization of various talmudic pro- nouncements as hyperbole, denouncing de'Rossi as "seeking to permit forbidden things." Very reverential in referring to Provencal, Neppi nonetheless defended de' Rossi, noting at length the positive intent of his studies. In this confrontation be- tween theological affirmation and critical historical analysis, the censure of de'Rossi's work in Italy was definitely not limited to what has sometimes been characterized as marginal, intellectually unaccomplished, superannuated rabbinic spokesmen and mystics. Weinberg rightly calls attention to de' Rossi's "consistently apologetic stance," even periodic dismissal of his own scholarly endeavor, and his assurance ofjudicious use of non-Jewish sources, all in anticipation of disapproval of his nov- el approach. Nevertheless, she observes that de' Rossi persisted in the pursuit of truth, even combining Neoplatonic with talmudic notions: "Truth is like a seal of the true God, the characteristic of the beautiful soul and the good to which all as- pire" (Intro., xxv f.; Trans. 406). She seems to conclude that "this discloses his true attitude ... which would appear to undermine all his token gestures toward rab- binic authority" (p. xxvi, n. 88), although she qualifies this by asserting that his search for truth precluded Sinaitically mandated tradition, and "the main body of Oral Torah." Perhaps it must be made clearer to the reader that even while stimu- lating doubt regarding some central areas of non-Sinaitic tradition, his objective embraced genuine concern for the intellectual integrity of the ancient sages, and he insisted that customary religious usage sanctioned by them, even in such areas, remained obligatory. If, as Weinberg stresses, the combination of the Neoplatonic and the rabbinic was intended to enhance "the significance of his work despite all his protestations that Torah study is of paramount importance" (p. 406 n. 4), he certainly was committed to the perpetuity of that study, even as he sought to bring new perspectives to it. 201</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Although it is not possible to do justice to a translation of more than 700 pages in a brief review, one must conclude that the combination of requisite schol- arship and creative skill required for a translation of Me'or Ceinayim is impressively obvious throughout Weinberg's work. Indeed, the challenge which this task pre- sents can even be gauged from passages where one may take issue with Weinberg's rendition of the text. De' Rossi for example, anticipating criticism of his use of non-Jewish authors, invoked Judah Messer Leon's disparaging reference to those "self-appointed" (p. 98) co-religionists who rejected truths from gentile sources, and Maimonides' insistence that the truth should be accepted irrespective of its source. As for his own treatise, de' Rossi referred to, as Weinberg translates, "the simpleton or hypocrite whose sole aim is to libel me for his own self-aggrandize- ment or to exploit my work, he should keep his hands off my book for it is not intended for him" (p. 99). De' Rossi's original reads "peti ve-savucah 'asher 'ein lo mikzo'ah rak tanuyei bi-nezikin le-hitgadel 'o le-kurdom, 'al na' tig'a yado be- hiburi zeh ki l'o 'eilav pi kar'ati" (Me'or ceinayim, ed. Cassel, p. 89),' meaning "the simpleton or hypocrite whose only area [of wisdom] is the exclusive study of [the Mishnaic Order of ] Damages in order that he may achieve fame or material gain." In contrast with "the person who has a brain in his head," whom de' Rossi had referred to some lines earlier, it was precisely the parochial minded talmudist who might indeed seek to defame him, that type whom he described in another context as "from among the common herd of talmudists" (ibid., p. 303: "'eizeh she-yiheyeh me-hamon ha-lamdanim"). Weinberg, who constantly cites de' Rossi's sources or allusions, surprisingly chooses here not to identify the rabbinic frame of reference (B. Berakhot, 20a, B. Ta'anit, 24a-b, &amp; B. Sanhedrin, 106b; M. Bava Batra, 10:8; M. Avot, 4:5). She resorts to a figurative translation, thus losing the contrast which de' Rossi constructed from a very literal and purposeful adaptation of rabbinic dicta. For all of de' Rossi's great gift for turning a phrase, given the hos- tile response to his work among contemporary rabbinic spokesmen, his derisive reference to narrow preoccupation with "tanuyei bi-nezikin" should be taken at face value. De' Rossi's contrast moreover echoes Maimonides' assertion that his Guide's purpose was not "to make its totality understandable to the vulgar (?le-ha- mon' Ibn Tibbon trans., Petihah, 4) ... nor to teach those who have not engaged in any study other than ... the legalistic study of the Law" (Guide, Intro., Pines trans., p. 5),2 but rather the individual drawn by the human intellect. There is also such a plethora of citations in Me'or ceinayim that an occasional oversight in precisely specifying a source is not inconceivable. Concerning the tal- mudic account of Rabbi Eleazar bar Yose's presence in Rome where he was able to see the Temple vessels, de' Rossi referred to Rashi's description of this in his commentary to tractate Mecilah (p. 609). De'Rossi's gloss here cites the lines from Rashi but incorrectly specifies their source as Me'ilah (p. 610, and n. 10: B. Meci- lah, 17b), when in fact they are in Rashi's commentary to Tractate Yoma, 57a where 1. Azariah de' Rossi, Me'or 'Einayim, ed. David Cassel (Vilna: Romm, 1866). 2.

Eleazar's experience in Rome is also mentioned. Weinberg's translation of the gloss overlooks this error. De'Rossi obviously echoed Proverbs 15:30 ("me'or Ceinayim yesamah leivav") when he asserted in his introduction that the work, being "me'or ceinai ve- simhat levavi"-'"the light of my eyes and the joy of my heart" (p. 6)-he named it, "Me'or Ceinayim." But what is not clearly articulated in the translator's title, "Light of the Eyes" was de'Rossi's intent to provide "Light for the Eyes" as the ti- tle has occasionally been rendered. More specifically it was the "Enlightenment of the Eyes" which de' Rossi hoped to impart to the reader "drawn by the human intellect" (p. 299) whom he regularly addressed in his work. In formulating his ti- tle, de' Rossi would of course have recalled Gersonides' comment on the verse in Proverbs to the effect that "the enlightenment of the eyes of the heart (i.e., the mind) gladdens the intellect for its joy is in the apprehension of speculative mat- ters" ("me'or ceinei ha-lev yesamah ha-sekhel ki simhato be-hasagot ha-ciyuni- yot"). The significance which de' Rossi attached to this choice of title may also be gauged from his determination to perpetuate his work by giving it a "shem colam," an everlasting name. Weinberg's translation will certainly contribute to the real- ization of that aspiration and the objective which it embodied. Lester A.
