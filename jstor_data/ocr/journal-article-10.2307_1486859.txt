New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. xiv, 404 pp. The military aid and diplomatic support extended by the United States to Israel has been very much a part of the national story of American Jewry since the end of World War II. David Schoenbaum reverses plot and subplot in order to study how the history of America's Jewish population left its imprint on United States policies in the Middle East. While the relationship between America's Jewish population and America's Middle East foreign policy has received some attention, the subject has triggered more polemical pronouncements than scholarly analysis. Even then, only the periods of crisis and confrontation tend to be emphasized. Schoenbaum has undertaken an extensive examination of United States policies with regard to Israel. The book surveys the development of United States policies not only in terms of the international and regional balance of power but also in the context of the changing status of American Jewry. The United States and the State of Israel draws on primary records, secondary works, and memoirs to explain almost a century of policy-making directed to the idea and fact of a Jewish state in the Middle East. The book joins together summaries of strategic perspectives with reviews of informal contacts between prominent Jews, high-level Washington pundits, and elected politicians. The main thrust of Schoenbaum's analysis highlights the following factors: the connections generated by common religious values, and additionally, in his words, the "moral and psychic legacy of the Holocaust ... and the exigencies of the Cold War" (p. 320). Schoenbaum addresses the linkages between these factors and American military procurement, economic aid, and political support for Israel since the state's founding in 1948. The founding of the World Zionist Organization coincided with a massive Jewish immigration to the United States. For many decades of the twentieth century-while a Jewish society and economy in Palestine were forged within the framework of British rule-American Jews were still accustomed to being defined as culturally alien. Israel's growth and development as a sovereign state occurred during a period of remarkable upward economic and social mobility for America's Jews. Jews found full acceptance in American society, and this success allowed them to galvanize their community into active lobbying efforts on behalf of Israel's interests. Schoenbaum is not the first to note that Jewish advocacy has helped to shape America's role in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 487 Middle East. Where he departs from other analysts is to suggest how difficult it may be to measure the effectiveness of such advocacy or the consequences of domestic Jewish successes. Schoenbaum also tries to recreate the context in which these policies were fashioned. The texture of America's political life is depicted by describing themes preoccupying the public or by mentioning topics of discussion which appeared in major newspapers and by drawing, once again, from highly personal recollections of events published in memoirs. How formidable a task selecting material was can be ascertained by attending to the book's extensive bibliography, which includes documents as well as a comprehensive list of the published records and the major secondary works. For this reader, however, Schoenbaum's book is challenging with respect to the questions it poses and ultimately vexing with regard to the assessments it presents. The descriptions of policy-making are so cluttered with anecdotal detail that it is difficult to follow the narrative. The inclusion of such material might have been intended to produce a serious book for the general reader, but most people will simply be overwhelmed by the amount of unsorted information. The writing fails to evoke the temper of the times or to bring original or critical insight to bear on the enormous amount of data. The book is much longer than it needs to be and should have been edited more carefully. Still, Schoenbaum's work should be praised for approaching a problem many scholars avoid. Of all areas of policy-making, external affairs appears the most distant from popular control. While interest groups may press in certain directions, conventional wisdom suggests that the makers of foreign policy respond to strategic imperatives rather than to domestic demands or needs. Scholars are most apt to examine foreign policies in light of ideologies or common values rather than as an outcome of domestic policy pressures. Although Schoenbaum's attempt to analyze United States policies in the Middle East through the prism of domestic politics is ultimately unsatisfactory, the world of policy-making which he opens up is worthy of serious consideration.
