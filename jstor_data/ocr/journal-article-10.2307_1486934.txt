<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan Cooper. Philip Roth and the Jews. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. xiv, 319 pp. One might view Alan Cooper's Philip Roth and the Jews as an unabashed love song for Philip Roth, a paean that takes full measure of the complexity and variety of both the man and the oeuvre. Writing to persuade those whose reading of Roth stopped in the 1970s, those whose impressions of (and taste for) the writer stalled in the wake of the scandalous (and riotous) Portnoy 's Complaint, Cooper sets out to demonstrate that Roth is not simply an enfant terrible (turned eminence grise) whose persona as a self-hating Jew and sophomoric bad boy has grown tedious. Rather, Cooper's exhaustively researched study of Roth's work and its ambivalent Jewish reception maps "genuine artistic and Jewish developments" overlooked, misread, or misun- derstood by Roth's Jewish readership. Through an intermingling of close reading and biographical material, Cooper's study demands a new encounter with Roth, a reassessment of the author's relationship with Jewishness. Cooper offers both a history of Roth's Jewish reception and a consideration of the place of Jewishness in Roth's writing. I use awkward and somewhat ambiguous locutions here-Jewish reception, Jewish readership--because Cooper brings under his purview a panoply of responses to Roth's writing, including representatives of organized Judaism, Jewish organizations, Jewish popular and intellectual publications, Jewish literary and social critics, in genres ranging from book reviews in the New York Times and Jewish weeklies, to extended essays by Irving Howe and Cynthia Ozick, to rabbinic homiletics, to a consideration by theologian Eugene Borowitz of Portnoy 's Complaint as a struggle with the yetser ha-ra-the evil inclination of rabbinic literature. In</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 333 ways which are sometimes illuminating and sometimes problematic, Cooper brings these diverse readers of Roth and their responses under the large umbrella of "the Jews." Underlying the book is a mission one might define as redemptive-to redeem a misunderstood, undervalued Roth. In face of the Jewish critics, Cooper mounts a persuasive defense of Roth against the charges of "anti- Semitism, betrayal of the family, misogyny, shallowness of imagination, and self-pity." Cooper argues that the secular American Jewish world in which Roth was raised fuels and challenges Roth's artistry, shaping his sense not only of the Jewish but also of the American struggle with modernity-with identity, with self-definition, with self-containment. As such, Cooper marvels at the consistent misunderstanding of Roth's artistry. However, that Jewish readers of different stripes have taken umbrage at their literary representation in Roth's writing is not so difficult to understand, On some level, Roth's writing puts forth a critique of the world of Jewish immigrants and the next generation. No one likes to be exposed to the outside without a mask. While one might say that Bernard Malamud dealt with America by constructing an image of the Jew that American Jews felt comfortable displaying to the outside--a Jew who is as imbued with Christian meaning as with Jewish tradition, a Jew whose reflection both secular and religious Jews would like to glimpse in the mirror-Roth's Jews are the vehicle by which the author scrutinizes and magnifies foibles identifiable as particularly Jewish. It is through this particularity that Roth addresses more general issues of modernity, mortality, and meaning. Thus, Roth does not prepare a seemly face to present to America so that the gentiles will like the Jews or so that Jews will like themselves. Exposing the extremities of Jewish American culture, often through grotesque exaggeration, Roth examines issues which touch raw nerves-unexamined nostalgia for old countries and old neighborhoods, for example, or an American Zionism which does not involve leaving home. Not surprisingly, then, the sensitivity of the issues that Roth takes on dis- comfits his readers. At the same time, the Jewishness of the writer, the fictional characters, and their settings attract to Roth's writing a Jewish readership with different levels of literary sophistication. Moreover, as Cooper makes clear, Roth has been criticized simultaneously for being too "confessional" and too disguised in his novels. The multiple positions put forth in his fiction, the prevalence of irony, have frequently been overlooked by naive as well as informed readers who take a single character's pronouncements out of context and see them as the voice of the author.</page><page sequence="3">334 BOOK REVIEWS In Cooper's sensitive reading, the often outrageous male protagonists of Roth's fiction are revealed as dimensions of the conflict between wanting to be both good and bad. Good is safe, restrained, repressed; bad is risky, pandering to one's appetites. First- and second-generation Americans, Jews only recently accepted into the American vista, bring these conflicts into sharp relief, for one had to satisfy not only one's community and oneself; one also imagined oneself under the scrutiny of the dominant culture. More generally, Roth's works grapple with the openness of a society which allows one to define oneself, but provides no persuasive grounds for doing so. Thus, the self-invention of the new Jew also becomes the plight of the modem man. Roth's repeated concern in his fiction with the writing of fiction, then, is less a narcissistic self-preoccupation than a way of thinking about the "fiction-making faculty" always implicated in the way we construct, represent, and reinvent ourselves. Cooper's recuperation of Roth and his Jewishness is particularly timely because its subject is coming to the attention of a new generation of Jewish American readers and critics in confrontation with the stuff of his novels. For these readers, Roth's writing offers a means for thinking through such issues as an unapologetically diasporic Jewish identity, Jewishness in the absence of antisemitism, in an open and inviting society, without the markings, or even the remembrance, of the immigrant. Perhaps it is also postmodemist sensibilities that have brought Roth out from under seemingly unremitting criticism; perhaps, too, it is that the objects of his scrutiny are members of an aging generation, and what scandalized them no longer scandalizes younger readers-neither the sexual hijinks nor the pangs of Jewish identity nor the pastiche of the first postimmigration generation, upwardly mobile and outwardly bound, open to but conflicted about the heady promise of secular America. Philip Roth and the Jews is thick with Roth. Cooper is superlatively familiar with the terrain-with Roth's writing and biographical matter, with Roth's critics. Sometimes this familiarity can overwhelm or suppose too much on the part of the reader whose reading of Roth's life and lifework has left lacunae. Since the book is written in a highly accessible style, this limits its readership unnecessarily. It is perhaps inevitable in a book such as this, which engages so closely with the author and his oeuvre, but at times the recuperation of Roth does not maintain sufficient distance from its object of analysis and defense. At moments, Cooper villainizes Roth's critics as mean-spirited or dense. A more sympathetic reading of the critics,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 335 particularly of the popular writers and rabbis and Jewish lay leaders, might better catch the Zeitgeist of the time in which Roth wrote certain works, and may be useful in understanding why his writing elicited strong misreadings (and not only misreadings) at particular moments, on the part of readers generally judged to be astute, such as Ozick and Howe. Similarly, the biographical sketches struck me as taking Roth's part too uncritically; for example, in describing the "soul-sapping dependence" of Roth's wife and mistress. In the final analysis, these do not detract from the book's persuasiveness. Philip Roth and the Jews offers a sustained and nuanced reading of the serious and important place of Jewishness in Roth's vast and impressive oeuvre. Sara R.
