<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 131 Hayim Lapin. Early Rabbinic Civil Law and the Social History of Roman Galilee: A Study ofMishnah Tractate Baba' Mesi 'a'. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. x, 368 pp. This book is a masterwork of learning and eloquence, setting a new standard for the historical and literary study of the Mishnah. Lapin offers a wealth of learning in the substantive discussion of his subject, but it is his methodology that has the most to teach us. The tractate Baba Mesi'a offers many vivid vignettes of social and economic relations in the world it purports to describe; this treasure is multiplied a hundredfold in the author's learned notes and perceptive discussions. And this despite the fact that the promise held out by the title remains unfulfilled: "A scholar who expected a detailed discussion of the social history of Roman Galilee will have been disappointed by this volume" (p. 237). No complete map of wealth and power in the Jewish community is offered by the tractate--or can be extracted from it by all the critic's cunning. The reasons for this are perhaps surprising. The text, of course, is the product of a religious elite, but also of a relatively privileged class of propertied house- holders whose many concerns-agricultural production, large-scale trade, banking, taxes, business transactions-reflect very accurately the common concerns of prosperous small-town people in the Roman world. What is by no means apparent in this document is the social world of the villagers who shared their lives with these thriving householders. Even fellow Jews for whom the rabbis' opinions were normative are more or less missing here--and sectarian groups are completely absent. But the tractate does offer a rather surprising, detailed confirmation of our newly emerging understanding of life in the hinterland of the Roman world during the first centuries of the common era. The wealth that Lapin displays in this book is diverse. First, there is the annotated text and translation of the Mishnah tractate, which appears as Appendix I. The basis of this text is the Kaufman manuscript; it is not Lapin's intention to supply a critical edition, but the most important variants are presented and critically assessed. The translation is fluent and careful-and very readable despite the translator's commitment to follow closely the "flow of the rhetoric of the Hebrew text and to highlight its complexity" (p. 243). The second appendix discusses the relationship of Baba Mesi'a to other "Tannaitic" corpora. Much of this latter material, so Lapin concludes (p. 329), is clearly secondary to Baba Mesi'a and influenced by it; the halakhic</page><page sequence="2">132 BOOK REVIEWS midrashim especially show such influences. In other cases, most notably the Tosepta, it remains possible that the influence ran the other way; at least, the Tosepta attests to the existence of "independent formulations of similar material whose existence cannot be attributed solely to borrowing from the Mishnah" (p. 329). What we learn from Lapin about the literary and social context in which the Mishnah was produced strongly suggests "a wider intellectual community, in which there may well have been considerably more material than that to which we have access" (p. 329). But the effect of this observation is to draw our attention back to the process that transformed these traditional materials into the Tradition. The study of the social, literary, and redactional structures and processes that brought about this transformation is the central concern of Lapin's work. He begins with the social study of the Mishnah. Defining terms and establishing the social context of the Mishnah are his first concerns (chap. 1, pp. 2-19). We have little evidence for the wider authority of rabbinic law; mishnaic texts express the concerns of the rabbis who produced them. Beyond that, what can we say? The texts reveal themselves as parts of a legal compendium in which m. Baba Mesi'a had its place as the second of three private-law tractates concerned with damages, contracts, and property; m. Baba Mesi'a itself ostensibly presents "rules for lost objects, deposits, sale, loans of various kinds, hiring and leasing of labor and property, and conflicts arising between neighbours" (p. 4). Like the Digest of Justinian, the Mishnah is an anthology of diverse legal opinions arranged by topic; unlike the Digest, the individual authority of the mishnaic editors is deliberately effaced, reflecting the "oral setting" of the original traditions, or the concern of the editors to clothe them in the rhetorical guise of orality. The historical background of the rabbinic movement is similarly elusive. Lapin wisely eschews the task of narrative reconstruction, recognizing the risk of "inventing histories out of the narrative intentions and choices of Rabbinic narrators, tradents and redactors" (p. 6). Much is known, however, about the historical setting of Roman Palestine, and Lapin has taken account of the best of recent scholarship (Millar and Isaac, for instance), charting the evolution from client kingdom to garrisoned province, from the experience of repeated rebellions and defeats to a role as valued collaborator of the Severan emperors. Certainly by the early years of the third century Jews emerge as agents of the imperial peace in control of the communities of Galilee. The remains of numerous synagogues are tangible material evidence for the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 133 social dominance of the "urban elite" that built and controlled them; and it is these urban elites who shaped and controlled what Lapin calls the "Rabbinic movement." "Nevertheless, outside of Rabbinic sources we know precious little about Rabbis" (p. 13). The patriarch himself is not attested in secular sources until well after the establishment of the Christian empire in the fourth century. The Christian perspectives of Justin and Origen add little to our knowledge of the origin and history of the rabbinic movement, though they attest to the social prominence of rabbis in the Palestinian society of their time. And this picture well confirms what little we can infer from rabbinic texts regarding the wealth and social authority of the rabbis. Still, it remains unlikely that the rabbis "served as the governing body of Roman Palestine" (p. 18). The rabbis of the mishnaic period resemble the many other "figures in the ancient Greco-Roman world who served as judges, miracle workers and arbiters of public opinion" (p. 19 and n. 49 with appropriate allusion to the classic essay of Peter Brown on the rise and function of the holy man in Late Antiquity). Well-to-do propertied householders, community leaders, and arbitrators--such were no doubt the rabbis of Roman Palestine. As defined by their social functions, however, these rabbis more closely resemble the holy men and women of (Christian) Late Antiquity, with whom they share a variety of charismatic roles.' The texts that attest to the social functions of the rabbis are at once literary artifacts and historical documents. Only a sophisticated methodology which accords equal importance to both aspects can hope to understand how these texts satisfy the formal requirements of their genre(s) while reflecting and attesting to the contingent historical processes that shaped their formation in conformity with the formal paradigm (cf. pp. 19-20, where Lapin eloquently articulates the historical importance of tracing the boundaries of the world "constructed" in rabbinic texts). As Lapin notes, the "construction" of rabbinic literature and society 1. Lapin's imaginative insight and mature judgment are well exemplified in his brief discussion of the ever popular Honi ha-Ma'agel (pp. 6-7, n. 15), whose charismatic rain-making caused such discomfort to his contemporaries. At least they did not make the mistake committed by most modem historians of denying his rain-making. As it happens, Josephus independently attests to the rain-making of a certain Onias in the first century B.C.E., but if Honi was not successful in bringing down the rain, what is the point of his story and what its "historical kernel"? This discussion reveals the hand of a truly gifted phenomenologist of religion, an approach more honored than emulated.</page><page sequence="4">134 BOOK REVIEWS is a task inherited, on the one hand, from ancient Judaism and closely allied, on the other, to the political and intellectual projects of other modem Western academic movements, such as "orientalism" (pp. 20-21). The various constructions of ancient Judaism shaped by modem scholars have been made to serve the needs of Christian polemic or conservative Jewish self- understanding. More recent research has broken with these early-modem approaches and focused instead on "methodological studies exploring and rethinking the compositional and redactional strategies that produced the Rabbinic texts" (and, by extension, has also focused on their historical circumstances; see p. 22). Central to this more recent research is the work of Jacob Neusner, with its inspired appropriation of form and redactional criticism from New Testament scholarship and of structuralist and symbolist models from social anthropology. Here Lapin again shows good judgment: Neusner's emphasis on the "argument" of each separate rabbinic work represents a useful advance, even if his sense of what constitutes that argument is often unbalanced, and he often "naively ignores the problems of the indeterminacy and multiplicity of meaning" (p. 25). Emphasizing the unity of a document can also lead to a devaluation of the redactional process and a neglect of the social matrix. Nonetheless Neusner's methodology remains the most useful guide (as exemplified in the "History of Mishnaic Law" series). Lapin thus chooses Baba Mesi'a as his focus. He views the text critically as a "literary artifact of late second and early third century Roman Galilee" (p. 25). And he compels it to reveal what the Mishnah "betrays about its own composition" (ibid.), while respecting the complexity of the Mishnah as a text (following the examples of Epstein and Halivni but in a more focused and subtle way). Excluded from the outset is the option of taking material attributed to individual rabbis as the words of these sages; rather, these attributions are rhetorical structures arising in the course of literary production. This being so, what can be said about the Mishnah as a historical document? Breaking here with Neusner's approach, Lapin attempts to deal seriously with the historical processes that shaped the Mishnah and are reflected therein: the interests of priests, scribes, and householders must be situated within their historical contexts, not left as abstractions or dealt with on the basis of "simplistic historical assumptions" (p. 29). In the "agrarian world of Roman Galilee" (p. 29) these texts can be situated not as some abstract "law" but as a reflection of legal systems that are portrayed as operating within the "fictional world" of the text. Some aspects of this world</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 135 are self-evident: the predominance of adult male householders, or the function of markets and bankers as a system serving their interests. Other aspects are less transparent: how to define "Israel" in this context, how to relate the rabbis to the landed elites of such concern to the text, how far down the social and economic spectrum rabbinic notions extended. The rhetoric of these texts is notably inclusive-but is it credible? In any case, Lapin's study must acknowledge many limits. Not that little is known about Roman Galilee, but the relationship between the Galilean world revealed by recent scholarship and the imaginative world of these texts remains most uncertain. Their "construction of knowledge" remains to be associated with contemporary "relations of power"--not least between the Greco-Roman elite and a whole range of indigenous cultures/communities in the ancient Near East. Here is further evidence of Lapin's insight and judgment: his exercise is resolutely historical--the imaginative world of the texts is assumed to have some relationship to a larger "historical world." The potential rewards are great: the history of Judaism is "de-centred" but the study reveals "that which is unique in Jewish civilizations as well" (p. 34). Lapin's first task is to identify and characterize the sources that underly the tractate Baba Mesi'a. But his primary focus is on the redactional process: how sources are woven together in the Mishnah text--often not smoothly, so that the weaving process is apparent in the disjunctures; how some sources circulated more widely and were reused in a variety of contexts; how we can identify "strategies for organizing and presenting material that preceded the final redaction of the tractate" (p. 115); and how source materials were adapted to their present function in the text. A separate but closely related issue concerns "the significance and utility of the traditions attributed to individuals" (p. 116). If we understand the redactional process aright, we will recognize that core traditions have been rather conservatively preserved in our text although freely organized, glossed, and corrected. Unfortunately, much less can be said about the sources themselves: how they were shaped in various schools of rabbinic thought, how they were formulated or organized. The purpose of the redactional process is quite clear. It was a process of social construction designed to centralize and institutionalize the rabbinic movement. In the world thus constructed, concludes Lapin (p. 117), two things stand out: the stories all involve rabbis, and they assume that practice is at issue, not correct opinion. How a rabbi treats his workers and tenants is offered "as evidence for how the world should be run" (p. 117). The balance of the book</page><page sequence="6">136 BOOK REVIEWS is devoted to explicating the economic institutions and social relationships with which the text is concemed--the business of well-to-do rabbis and householders. How many daily workers and tenants would see their lives reflected in this text is another question altogether. Three economic and social institutions constitute a primary focus of the book: money, markets, and banks. The text reflects the use of a standardized system of coinage, in which, however, the coins could vary in value with respect to one another (a familiar facet of the Roman provincial economy). A distinction was commonly made between "money" and "commodity," but the rabbis understood very well the trade in futures. More striking is the picture that emerges of the nonmonetary economy: the Mishnah commonly presupposes that agricultural workers are, at least partially, paid in kind, and that agricultural leases generally do not involve the payment of cash, while others have "a greater use for money as well as greater means for gaining wealth in the form of coin" (p. 134). Needless to say, as well-to-do householders the rabbis, for the most part, share the perspective of the monetarized economy. And the market is also all-important in their world with its omnipresent middle-men: direct sale from producer to consumer is conspicuously absent (p. 145). And even if market professionals are not presupposed in every narrative, the scale of the transactions commonly adduced does not reflect a world of small sellers (cf. p. 147: "Rabbis are concerned with small farmers and markets primarily when questions of ritual are raised"). Lapin even suggests that the people "about whom the rules of m Baba Mesi 'a speak" were not themselves directly dependent on the produce of fields; they bought their food in markets and stored their wealth as money (p. 147). Banks and bankers are common features of the mishnaic world. Their activities were comparable to those of other banks in the Greco-Roman world (apart from the lending of money at interest). But bankers are small-scale business people, more comparable to money changers and market sellers; we should not imagine ancient banking as a powerful institution controlling assets on a large scale, but as something that served as a convenience to "retail" customers. Economic and social relationships reveal the dynamic dimension of this world. Consistently emphasized here is the social equality of the partners to the relationships: finder and loser, placer and receiver of a deposit, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, laborer and employer, lessor and lessee. Throughout, an agrarian economy is presupposed; its natural rhythms</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 137 condition most actions here. The Mishnah also presupposes a consistent institutional framework for economic transactions. It is more difficult to decide how comprehensive that framework was. In any case our text seems to assume that householders, not bankers, control the economic system as the source of loans, the holders of substantial landed property. All this is consistent with the worldview that emerges from Greco-Roman documents and Roman juristic texts. "What is peculiar to the Mishnah . . is the way in which rules concerning money and contracts are utilized to articulate the boundaries of a Jewish society" (p. 234). And this community is imagined as an egalitarian one, which possibly explains the neglect in the mishnaic text of truly dependent labor or long-term tenancy, common features of the rabbinic world, as far as we can judge. Here is revealed the central paradox of our subject-the tension between the "consistent attention to the concerns of wealthier owners of property and status egalitarianism" (p. 234). This tension is well expressed in a story about R. Yohanan b. Mattya (M 7:1): because his workers are entitled to nothing but the best food as fellow Israelites, the rabbi insists that the labor contract should stipulate what they will receive, only the bread and beans common to agricultural workers! Lapin's conclusions are consistent with this picture. Given its redactional history, our text cannot be understood as a " 'handbook' for landholders who wish to proceed according to God's law" (p. 237). Rather, it was produced by the rabbinic community for its own specialist audience. Purporting to describe the structures and functioning of the society that is its imagined context, the text propagandizes for its own worldview, as such texts are wont to do. And its intended audience seems to consist of wealthy householders, property owners for the most part. A high standard is prescribed; it is not only explicitly usurious loans that are prohibited but even those loans for which the borrower provides "gifts" in money or kind. "Here the laws of usury seem to be constructed to avoid systems of patronage based on wealth and power" (p. 239). But the text avoids truly dependent relationships, such as bound tenancy. All Israelites are equal, but social and economic inequalities must be accepted--which is another way of saying that the rabbis sanctioned a set of unequal relationships between rich and poor, marking it with the image of a theoretical egalitarianism. This conclusion is absolutely consistent with what we know independently of the social role and functioning of small-town elites in the Roman world, as Lapin rightly observes. And yet it is this aspiration toward an egalitarian Israel that gives the rabbinic worldview its distinctive</page><page sequence="8">138 BOOK REVIEWS identity, the more so in a world that was otherwise so deeply divided on ethnic, religious, and economic lines. Lapin's work stands out as articulate and insightful. More expert readers will judge for themselves his mastery of the rabbinic sources. His sure understanding of a wide range of Greco-Roman sources and his sure grasp of modem interpretive scholarship distinguish him as the peer of the best among contemporary scholars. And yet what is most distinctive in his contribution to increasing our understanding of the rabbinic world is Lapin's sense of how the authors, and more explicitly the redactors, of this text worked to construct the world as they wished it to be, by constructing this text in which all Israel stand forth as equals whatever the circumstances of their social situation.
