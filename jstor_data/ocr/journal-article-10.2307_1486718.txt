<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Cesarani. The "Jewish Chronicle" and Anglo-Jewry, 1841-1991. Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. xiv, 329 pp. The Jewish Chronicle was founded in 1841--one of an ever increasing range of English denominational newspapers and periodicals. Greatly influ- enced by the European Jewish press, this "organ of Anglo Jewry" played a fundamental role in the shaping of Anglo-Jewish identity and in the representation of Jews to the majority society. Indeed, writes David Cesarani, it "defined the parameters for debate on communal and other issues; it gave Jews in Britain an awareness of what was happening to Jews in other countries; it offered them a digest of Jewish cultural activity; and it functioned as a forum for the discussion of Judaism" (p. ix). In its early decades the Jewish Chronicle grappled essentially with the place of Jews in Victorian Britain. Reform Judaism, issues of ritual and decorum, the democratization of Jewish leadership, and anticonversionist polemics were never far from the paper's concerns, as was the position of Jews in other countries, most especially the Balkans and Russia. But two questions appeared paramount: "how to prevent complete assimilation and how to be a good English citizen, spurning separatism" (p. 52). Managing these two polarities was never an easy task. A very severe test came in the form of the "Eastern Question" when Jewish support for the Turks against the national aspirations of Christian Slavs raised questions of loyalty. The tenuousness of Jewish acceptance in English society was most vividly expressed by Goldwin-Smith, the former Regius Professor of History at Oxford University, who argued that the Eastern Question had shown Jewish emancipation to have been a mistake. Little wonder that the Jewish Chronicle welcomed with great pleasure the attention lavished on Sir Moses Montefiore on his hundredth birthday in 1884 and the ennoblement of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild in 1885. In these two gentlemen one could demonstrate the compatibility of Jewishness and Englishness.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 417 That compatibility was sorely tested with the growing influx of alien Eastern European Jews in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Amidst calls for their repatriation, the Jewish Chronicle pushed for the angli- cization and remolding of the newcomers, while ignoring Jewish socialism, anarchism, and crime. The Jews' Free School was entrusted with the task of making "Jews Englishmen" (p. 78), as were the Jewish Working Men's Clubs and the Jewish Lads' Brigade. Predictably the Jewish Chronicle denigrated the incipient Zionist move- ment and emerged as "one of Herzl's most bitter opponents" (p. 86). The very notion of an international Zionist conference was anathema and, as it explained, "an insult to the patriotism of Jews of various nationalities" (p. 87). That patriotism was demonstrated by Jewish involvement in the Anglo-Boer War. The symbiosis between Englishness and Jewishness was possible! Notwithstanding its antipathy toward the Jewish national movement, the Jewish Chronicle gave wide coverage to the First World Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897. In addition it paid serious attention to all manifestations of antisemitism. Judeophobia, however, was not perceived as endemic; rather it was explained as atavistic medieval hatred that would erode in time. Following a change in the ownership of the newspaper and the appointment of Leopold Greenberg as editor in 1907, the Jewish Chronicle became much more supportive of the Zionist enterprise. Greenberg also looked more closely at the seamier side of Anglo-Jewish life, including the white slave traffic. Serious challenges were posed for Jews during the First World War, when, amidst a wave of anti-alienism, their position in British society weakened considerably. Once again the Jewish Chronicle felt obliged to demonstrate Jewish loyalty, ironically at the same time as the ground was being laid for the Balfour Declaration. Here Cesarani provides fascinating insights into behind-the-scenes negotiations. The 1930s presented major challenges for the Jewish Chronicle as Jews confronted the rise of Nazism, the British Union of Fascists, and the plight of Jewish refugees. Focus during the Second World War was on the home front, domestic antisemitism, and the Middle East, and it was only toward the end of the war that the Jewish catastrophe itself was considered in any detail. Hitherto the Jewish Chronicle had taken the line that special pleading for Jews was unacceptable. The primary task was to defeat the Germans. Sentiment changed rapidly after the war as Greenberg challenged British policy in Palestine. Ultimately he was forced to resign because of his anti-British editorials.</page><page sequence="3">418 BOOK REVIEWS The postwar years were less stressful. Emphasis was on disaffiliation from Judaism, the rise of racism in Britain, the nature of the Board of Deputies, and questions of Orthodoxy. With regard to the latter, Cesarani provides detailed and interesting coverage of the battles between William Frankel, editor of the Jewish Chronicle from 1958 to 1977, and the chief rabbi, Israel Brodie, over the "Jacobs Affair." Besides domestic issues the paper continued to cover world Jewry, especially events in Israel. It would have been easy for those wishing to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Jewish Chronicle to have decided on a glossy, nonacademic, coffee-table tribute. Instead the scholarly route was chosen, and those con- cerned are to be commended for this. In David Cesarani the Jewish Chronicle has found its historian. He takes his readers into the editorial office, acquaints them with proprietary battles, and reminds them of business matters and circulation figures. Most importantly, he demonstrates admirably the axiom enunciated at the outset of this carefully researched and well-written study: "While it is impossible to write the history of Anglo-Jewry relying solely on the Jewish Chronicle, it is equally impracticable to try writing Anglo-Jewish history without it" (p. xi).
