New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America (distributed by Ktav), 1982. xiii, 151, 155 (Hebrew) pp. The works of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Averroes heavily influenced Jewish rationalists of the later medieval period. Although in recent decades there has been an increase of attention to Averroes' writings, many are not yet available in scholarly editions, and fewer still in English translation. In the Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction, probably written late in his career, Averroes wrestles with the question whether a human intellect could achieve immortality or, in medieval Aristotelian terms, whether some part or phase of the human soul or intellect could "conjoin with" an eternal, cosmic intellect. If such a conjunction were deemed possible, then what is the relationship of the potentially immortal part or phase to the mortal soul and the mortal body? One of the approaches to these issues pursued by Averroes in his psychological treatises and most especially the Epistle was an analysis of the kinds of connections that can exist between forms and their substrates. Half of this text was edited with a German translation and notes by L. Hannes in 1892 (Des A verroes Abhandlung: "Ober die M6glichkeit der Con- junction ..."). Professor Bland's edition presents the complete text by Averroes accompanied by the commentary of Moses Narboni. As is typical of the eclectic commentaries of this fourteenth-century Jewish rationalist, Narboni here compares the views of Averroes, Maimonides, and other thinkers, generally following the lead of Averroes. Even more than in Aver- roes' earlier works, the discussions in the Epistle and Narboni's commentary are technical and complex, inviting a clear translation and an informative explication. Unfortunately these needs are not filled by this edition. Aside from a new two-page preface, nine pages of indexes, and a handful of additional references in the footnotes, this edition is identical to Professor Bland's dissertation, completed in 1972. The Hebrew text has apparently been photo-offset from the typed copy of the original dissertation. A number of corrections of typing errors in the text and critical apparatus were listed at the end of the dissertation; instead of incorporating these correc- tions into the text of the published edition, the editor has simply reproduced the list. There remain additional typographical errors, e.g., 10:3, 28:14, 29:10, etc. The editor chose to follow a single text rather than create an</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 241 eclectic text; consequently one must keep an eye on the critical apparatus to avoid being misled by copyist's errors (e.g., 12:37, 14:60, 35:23). On the whole the Hebrew text is neat, legible, and well punctuated. Professor Bland announces his intention to write a translation that is "as literal as English usage will allow" (p. 11). The result in this case is loss of clarity. The English reader is quickly entangled in a thicket of run-on sen- tences, dangling clauses, and unidentified pronouns. It is frequently impos- sible to maintain sight of the terminology and conceptual distinctions being made, as well as a view of the argument as a whole. The translation cannot stand alone. Unfortunately, the footnotes do not aid the reader's comprehension of the text. There are few notes which analyze terms or monitor the structural course of the arguments. The footnotes that are supplied contain a wealth of bibliographic references but do not, with few exceptions, refer to scholarly works published since 1972. The introduction is extremely brief, and does not analyze technical terms and concepts nor place them in a larger context of Averroist or general medieval philosophic thought. For example, a treatment of Averroes' "dis- tinction between ontological and perceptual perfection" (p. 3) promised for later in the book (p. 15, n. 22) is nowhere to be found. Professor Bland states that it was not his "purpose to subject ibn Rushd's . . . [theories] to critical scrutiny" (p. 7); nevertheless, more explication of this difficult text would have been helpful. Jesse Mashbaum Baltimore, Md.</page></plain_text>
