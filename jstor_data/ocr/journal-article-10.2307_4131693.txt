<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews David N. Myers. Resisting History: Historicism and its Discontents in German- Jewish Thought. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003. x, 249 pp. In Resisting History, David Myers brings together two long-standing interests: the history and politics of modem Jewish historiography and the ten- sions and upheavals of Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies, with a particular focus on the culture of the Weimar Republic. Both interests unfold in two concurrent, intersecting spheres: that of Europe and its German Protestant cultural streams and that of its flourishing Jewish subculture- or better, Teilkultur (semiculture). Through the prism of this combustible and exhilarating period, Myers sets his sights on the phenomenon of Jewish antihis- toricism, seeking to trace a Jewish parallel to or manifestation of the broader crises of historicism that preoccupied contemporary German intellectuals. Myers sets out by tracing the trajectory of German and German Jewish historicist thinking, following its nineteenth-century rise and the subsequent expression of philosophical and theological dissatisfaction with its myopic Weltanschauung. At the heart of the book is a presentation of four important German Jewish intellectuals and the "diverse inflections-political, theological, generational-of their shared anti-historicist language" (11). The vastly different religious sensibilities and intellectual predilections of these thinkers-Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Leo Strauss, and Isaac Breuer-illustrate the wide shadow cast by the cultural malaise of their day. Weary of the atomizing, sterile, and corrosively reductionist strains of historicism, these thinkers are individually portrayed as seeking their way (back) to a more universalist, wholesome, and irreducibly metahistorical notion of Judaism. The resistance to history is thus rooted in the search for a meaningful Jewish existence, one that simultaneously draws on and yet resists their deep attachment to German culture. This poignant struggle of "Jewishness" and "Germanness" is further highlighted by its intersection with the discomfiting rise of Zionism, and Myers links antihistoricism with an ambivalence-if not outright hostility- toward Zionism. Despite the unquestionably interesting subject of this book and its admirably polished and engaging presentation, Resisting History is burdened with three related problems. The first problem is a conjoined lack of proper historical contex- tualization and epistemological definition. An appreciation of the philosophical or theological objections to historicism is predicated on a full understanding of his- toricism itself, and this includes not only its history but also its epistemological assumptions, methods, and claims. Myers certainly acknowledges the difficultly of articulating a strict definition of historicism, although he then proceeds to take a rather circumscribed view of the term as the embrace of the "historical indi- viduum" (18), that is, the contextualization of individual historical events as a series of unique and disconnected moments. His portrayal of the nineteenth century suggests an inexorable march toward this variety of historicism, offset 488</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews only by a number of heroic attempts to resist its overbearing relativism and fragmentation. The fact is, however, that the European historicism of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was much more variegated than Myers fully allows and included transcendent metahistorical notions that were not unlike the ideas expressed a century later by Myers's protagonists. Moreover, the nature of the distinctly Christian and intrinsically anti-Jewish nature of this meta- historical universalism served as a profound challenge to Jews, and they responded in two ways. On one hand, Moses Mendelssohn sharply questioned Gotthold Lessing's notion of historical knowledge and its ability to support transcendent historical claims. Analyzing the presumed epistemological basis of historical knowledge, Mendelssohn insisted that the path to universal truth was neither historically mediated nor historically supported. Mendelssohn's uncoupling of philosophy and history was not so much a move to denigrate historical knowledge as it was an attempt to preserve the distinction between the universal and the particular, between the transcendent and the parochial Jewish experiences that only historical memory could preserve. On the other hand, the earliest proponents of Wissenschaft des Judentums-writers from Immanuel Wolf to Abraham Geiger-responded not by epistemologically ques- tioning the regnant historicist notions de jour but by adapting their universalist metahistorical narrative to include Jews and Judaism, thereby rejecting the Christian interpretation of history and subversively replacing it with a Jewish narrative, one that was perforce truly universal in its inclusiveness. The story of European historicism and its concomitant Jewish adaptation and resistance, in other words, is far richer and more complicated than this book acknowledges. Such contextualization is imperative here, for it significantly broadens and complicates Myers's unnecessarily constricted presentation. A second fundamental problem is the centrality of antihistoricist thinking in the mature thought of Cohen, Rosenzweig, Strauss, and Breuer. In some respects, the issue is once again distorted contextualization. Myers, for example, speaks of Cohen's "faith in a Jewish-Protestant bond" (48) and affinity for Protestant culture, out of which grew his determined embrace of enlightened ethical universalism and resistance to historicism. Central to Cohen's reflections on history was his critique of Heinrich Graetz, who serves throughout as a convenient foil for Cohen's anti- historicism. The reader, however, is barely told that Graetz's historical writing was itself a monumental critique of the Reform notion of Judaism as a set of universal and timeless ethics, one that consistently denuded Judaism of its historical and national particularism. Graetz, moreover, hardly subscribed to a reductionist- atomistic historicism; instead, he tried to balance the metahistory that was popular at the beginning of the nineteenth century with a more honest historical accounting of the Jews as a people with a political history. In this context, it appears that Cohen's objections to Graetz had far less to do with a deeply considered epistemological reflection on the study of history than with a desire to preserve an older and well-worn liberal notion of Judaism that had little use for the inconvenient realities of Jewish particularism. This was, in other words, not really a debate about history but about the intellectual contortions of 489</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews German Jewish identity. Similarly, with regard to Rosenzweig, Myers makes much of the antihistoricist bent of his writings on Jewish education, although a reading of his texts yields less of a substantive concern with historicism and more of a simple and altogether natural emphasis on the central importance of texts and ideas as a way to revive Jewish learning. The real question here-and it recurs with regard to all the thinkers treated in Resisting History-is whether the antihistoricism that Myers describes is truly central to their oeuvre. Myers's declared method is to use his "protagonist's intel- lectual biography to trace the contours of [their] anti-historicist discourse" (75). Toward this end, Myers picks through letters, essays, and occasional writings, often pulling a few lines from here and there to paint the portrait he seeks. Leavened with some personal anecdotes, this makes for interesting although ulti- mately unsatisfying reading, for what is absent in all this is a serious effort to root the antihistoricism in the mature work of each individual. The fact that Cohen's Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism and Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption are both treated rather sparingly is a serious deficiency, as it is in these works that each thinker systematically laid out his thoughts on philosophy and religion in general and Judaism in particular. Rosenzweig's Star, in fact, sets out an epistemological challenge to the inherited metaphysical enterprise, includ- ing German idealism, and historicism is arguably a secondary and derivative aspect of that larger battle. Therefore, if one is to properly assess historicism as it appeared in their thinking, it must be done on the basis of the central themes and concerns of their most important writings. In the absence of such analysis, the significance of early-twentieth-century antihistoricism remains an open question. The third problem, finally, is the treatment of Zionism. Briefly stated, Zionism is here painted in one-dimensional, simplistic terms, a convenient foil that bears little resemblance to the rich variety of early Zionist worldviews. Cohen and Rosenzweig, for example, are said to have opposed Zionism because it "sought to return the Jewish people to history," that is, to remove the Jews from their "extraterritorial and extratemporal Exile" to the "base materialism" of history (85). The words cited here are not those of Cohen and Rosenzweig, and although Myers has every right to his interpretations, he also has a responsibility to put such ideas into some context. Cohen and Rosenzweig were well aware that Zionism was as much about cultural and spiritual renewal as it was about history and that there were leading Zionist thinkers who believed no less than they in the continuance of a rich spiritual and cultural Diaspora existence. As such, Myers either must be more critical of the superficiality of their assessment of Zionism or else present their thinking in far greater depth and nuance. Similarly, in his discussion of Breuer's attitude toward Zionism and his role in the founding of the Agudat Yisrael, Myers neglects to mention three decades of religious Zionism that predated Breuer. It is hardly insignificant that other early religious Zionist thinkers-living worlds away from Weimar, Germany-were also struggling to articulate a worldview that adapted traditional notions of messianism and divine providence to the nationalism and trenchant "materialism" of secular Zionism. Once again, a full and proper consideration 490</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews of the issues would seriously mitigate the significance of the German antihistori- cism described here. There is no question that Resisting History addresses itself to a most inter- esting subject, one that is worthy of further scholarly attention. Myers must be commended for initiating the discussion here, but even a work that explores the resistance to historicism must be more attentive to proper contextualization.
