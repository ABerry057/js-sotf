Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002. 300 pp. The Keepers is a concise and informative introduction to the history and re- ligion of the Samaritans, that branch of the Israelite-Jewish religion that has en- dured from antiquity to the present among a tiny minority in Palestine and Israel. The book is written in an engaging style that will appeal to a public that would not read specialized works on the subject. At the same time, the information contained in the work is reliable and the authors are careful in their discussions of unsolved (and often unsolvable) issues. In an epilogue, Anderson and Giles underline that there remains a "host of unanswered questions about the history and culture of the Samaritan community" and that this book is "only a beginning" (p. 145). The authors' inspiration to write the book derives, at least in part, from their work on the large collection of Samaritan manuscripts and artifacts in the Cham- berlain-Warren Collection at Michigan State University. The origins of the Col- lection are told in Chapter 1 in an engrossing style worthy of a detective story that draws the reader further and further into the book. The Collection is named after the American millionaire and churchman E. K. Warren (from Three Oakes, Michi- gan) and his son-in-law, E W. Chamberlain. Warren met the Samaritans for the first time in 1901 during a visit to Palestine. He later bought from them manuscripts (Pentateuchs, liturgical texts, and a copy of Tibat marqe, a midrashic composition) and artifacts (marble inscriptions and a Torah scroll case) and supported them fi- nancially; from 1913 on he was chairman of the Samaritan American Committee. When he died in 1919, most of the manuscripts he had bought were sent to a mu- seum in Three Oakes. In 1950, when the museum closed, they were given to Michi- gan State University. It was only in 1968 that they were rediscovered, studied, and described by R. T. Anderson, and in 1978 Anderson published a catalogue of the Collection for the use of scholars, entitled Studies in Samaritan Manuscripts and Artifacts: The Chamberlain-Warren Collection (American Schools of Oriental Re- search, Monograph Series, 1). After briefly introducing the Samaritans, the authors outline in Chapter 2 the various views on the thorny issue of the origin of the Samaritans. They rightly em- phasize that Samaritanism as a distinct religion did not arise as a result of the As- syrian conquest in the eighth century B.C.E. Rather, the separation of Judaism and Samaritanism "developed over centuries, culminating in a series of fateful events and decisions during the second century B.C.E." (p. 16). The other subjects treat- ed by the book are: Samaritan history according to the successive periods (from antiquity to the modern era, Ch. 3-7), the Samaritan Pentateuch (Ch. 8), and Samaritan religion (Ch. 9). The last chapter, Chapter 10, closes the circle by re- turning to the Chamberlain-Warren Collection and giving additional descrip- tions of its contents (some items were already described in previous chapters in 351</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews their historical context) and, in the process, making connections to what is known about particular Samaritans mentioned in the Chamberlain-Warren manuscripts from other sources. Only in a few instances one would have wished for a more nuanced or more complete treatment. Sometimes the term "Samarians," that is, inhabitants of Samaria, should have been used rather than "Samaritans," that is, members of a re- ligion separate from Judaism. Thus it is stated: "Oppressed by Assyrians, Babylo- nians, and Persians, the Samaritans had minimal resources [for temple building]" (p. 130); but Samaritans in the strict sense of the term did not yet exist during these time periods, as the authors themselves point out in the chapters on Samaritan ori- gins and on the Persian period. In connection with the discussion of the numerous honorific titles employed by the Samaritans in acrostics and bills of sale of Penta- teuch manuscripts, the authors state that most of these titles have never been trans- lated and remain "in various degrees of obscurity" (p. 114). Although they do mention translations by E. Robertson and A. Cowley, there is also an extensive list in R. Pummer, Samaritan Marriage Contracts and Deeds of Divorce (vol. 2, pp. 257-72). In their discussion of the question of the existence of a Samaritan temple, Anderson and Giles claim that the Delos inscriptions from the third and second centuries B.C.E. (according to paleographical criteria) speak of a "temple [on] Argarizim" (p. 129). But the inscriptions refer to the "hallowed (consecrated) Argarizein" (eis hieron [hagion] Argarizein) rather than to a temple; and, in fact, on page 29 Anderson and Giles use the translation "holy Argarizein." But these are minor points that do not detract from the value of the work. In sum, the book is a welcome addition to the literature on the religion, cul- ture, and history of the Samaritans; one that makes the subject interesting and ac- cessible to a wide readership. In addition, it is beautifully produced and almost free of printing errors. Maps; photographs; boxes in the text highlighting certain top- ics or presenting primary texts in English translation or excerpts from secondary sources; the rendition of inscriptions and colophons in Hebrew and English; and a thorough bibliography arranged according to themes as well as an index of sub- jects and authors all serve to enhance its usefulness. The work admirably fulfills its purpose as an introduction to Samaritanism that is readable and engaging and will be appreciated by a broad audience.
