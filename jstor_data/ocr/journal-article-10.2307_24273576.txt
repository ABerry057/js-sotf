Here is the cor rected version. Abstract: The acculturation of Ashkenazic Jews in Italy is the focus of the the present discussion. By 1500 Jews had been living in Padua for cen turies,turies, but their cemeteries were destroyed in 1509. Four cemeteries remained remained with over 1200 inscriptions between 1530-1860. The literary features features of the inscriptions indicate a shift from a preference for epi taphstaphs written in prose, like those of medieval Germany, to epitaphs in the the form of Italian Jewry's occasional poetry. The art and architecture of of the tombstones are part and parcel of the Renaissance ambient, with the the portals and heraldry characteristic of Palladian edifices. The letter ing,ing, too, presents a shift from the constituency's medieval Ashkenazic origins origins to its Italian setting. These developments are situated in the broader broader context of Italian Jewish art and architecture, while the literary innovations innovations are shown to reflect the revival of the epigram among poets of the Italian Renaissance.
