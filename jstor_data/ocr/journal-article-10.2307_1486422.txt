<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERSONIDES ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CONJUNCTION WITH THE AGENT INTELLECT by SEYMOUR FELDMAN Rutgers College In De anima 3. 5 Aristotle distinguished two aspects in the activity of in- tellection or knowing: one active, the other passive. His remarks are notoriously obscure, and they have occasioned an enormous exegetical literature from antiquity to our own day. Besides laying the foundations of an epistemological edifice that remained intact for many centuries, Aristotle also suggested that the active factor in knowing is eternal and immortal. Thus, he retained in some form Plato's belief that there is a link between knowledge and immortality.' Several of the leading ancient and medieval in- terpreters of Aristotle developed this suggestion into a complex doctrine of immortality, the main thesis of which was the idea that human perfection 1.

Underlying the crucial passage in De anima 3. 5 is a specific model of cognition according to which knowledge is essentially a passive function in which the human mind receives its contents from external sources. The famous metaphor of the mind as a blank tablet-a tabula rasa, on which its knowledge is written-was suggested by Aristotle long before John Locke.4 Aristotle arrived at this conception of knowledge from an analogy made with seeing: just as the eye receives its visual images from external objects via the medium of light, which illumines both the objects and the eye, so too the mind receives its contents via some power that stimulates the cognitive act by doing something to both the mind and the objects from which the mind receives its information. The last clause is intentionally vague, since it is not clear in Aristotle what the active power is and how it performs its operations. A significant stage in the career of this theory was reached when Alex- ander of Aphrodisias (ca. 180-200 C.E.) commented upon Aristotle's ob- scure remarks about the soul and its activities. In Aristotle the active func- tion in intellection is anonymous, although there is a name for the passive aspect- o6 7raOrTLtK6o voO, 'the passive intellect.'5 Alexander gave the active 2. Sometimes it was claimed that the active power unites or attaches itself with the human intellect or with a part of it. Since the relation of union or conjunction is symmetrical, the ver- bal order is immaterial. 3. Gersonides uses the terms 'conjunction' (mp'n) and 'union' (n'nnxnn) interchangeably (Levi ben Gerson, Milhamot ha-shem [Leipzig, 1866, henceforth abbreviated as MH] 1. 1, p. 18; 1. 4, p. 28; 1. 6, p. 36; 1. 8, p. 52; idem, Supercommentary on Averroes' Epitome of De anima, MS Bodley Opp. Add. 4to 3, fol. 248v; idem, Commentary on the Pentateuch [Venice, 1547], pp. 41a, 56b). P. Merlan has claimed that the terms 'union' and 'conjunction' do differ in connotation in certain authors, although not in all (Philip Merlan, Monopsychism, Mysticism, Metacon- sciousness [The Hague, 1963], pp. 18-29). Davidson too distinguishes between these two con- cepts in theories of Al-Farabi and Avicenna (Herbert Davidson, "Al-Farabi and Avicenna on the Active Intellect," Viator 3 [1972]: 169-71). For Gersonides, however, such differences can be ignored. 4. Aristotle De anima 3. 4. 430a1. John Locke, Essay on the Human Understanding, 2. 1. 2. 5. In only one passage does Aristotle refer to the passive power of the mind as 'the passive intellect', which he claims is perishable (De anima 3. 5 430a24-25).

In Alex- ander's reading of Aristotle the material intellect is interpreted as a poten- tiality, or disposition (dirtTb6eOt6rTS), for knowledge.8 As such the material intellect is not to be hypostasized: it is not a substance, which for Aristotle would imply that it is a separately existing thing or capable of separate ex- istence. Rather, the material intellect is a natural capacity, one among many, of the organism, through which it can engage in a specific kind of ac- tivity. The Agent Intellect, on the other hand, is for Alexander a separately existing substance, radically different from man and from any human capacity. To be sure, in cognition the Agent Intellect comes into contact with us and helps energize our intellectual powers. But it is primarily a transcendent entity. Indeed, for Alexander, the Agent Intellect is identical with God.9 Thus, in Alexander's interpretation of De anima 3. 5, we have two sharply differentiated entities, man and the divine Agent Intellect, the former having the potentiality to know, whereas the latter is always know- ing. Nor is this all. Alexander describes in detail the career of this disposi- tion. First, when it is put into action by the joint effort of the appropriate objects of knowledge (vorrTi) and the Agent Intellect, it becomes an intellect in act (o voOv Kar' ivepyeiav), i.e., a mind that is engaged in the activity of knowing. But we are not always so engaged; unlike the Agent Intellect, we sometimes, if not often, fail to exercise our cognitive capacities. This does not mean, however, that we have lost our already actualized capacity to know or our acquired cognitive capital. On the contrary, the disposition to know that has been manifested and developed constitutes a habit that has been established in the organism, 'the intellect in habitu', 6 vovs KaO0' 'tlv.10 6.

Seen in this light this habit receives a different name: 'the acquired intellect', 6 voOV iTdiKTrroS. 1 By now it should be apparent that the brief and enigmatic chapter in De anima has been fleshed out by Alexander into a full-grown theory with several clearly delineated characters. It is in terms of these con- ceptual and terminological innovations that the subsequent accounts of both the material and the Agent intellects are developed.'2 In general, this is the theory of the material intellect adopted by Gersonides. In spite of Alexander's important contributions, there was at least one point in Alexander's interpretation of Aristotle that was not sufficiently ex- plicated. In what sense, if any, is man immortal? In several places Alexander explicitly claims that the material intellect is subject to decay and corrup- tion.'3 After all, it is only the disposition of a body; when the body dies, its potentialities and capacities also perish. Yet, Alexander was not always so clear or consistent, and on occasion he suggested a different account; as we shall see, that was to be of great significance in this theory. Although Alexander's development of Aristotle's original remarks was to shape the subsequent discussions of this whole topic, his reading of De anima 3. 5 was not universally followed. In the next century, the Greek com- mentator Themistius offered an interpretation of Aristotle's psychology that significantly diverged from Alexander's reading in two central points. First, he rejected Alexander's dispositional and naturalistic analysis of the material intellect and claimed instead that the latter is an incorporeal sub- stance having separate and independent existence. Second, the Agent Intel- lect is primarily an immanent and inherent power of the human mind; it is not merely an external, supervenient factor in human cognition.'4 These two claims of Themistius constitute a radically different psychology, some of whose implications will be explored in this essay. For the purposes of our subsequent exposition, it will be useful to represent the divergent interpreta- tions of Aristotle's De anima 3. 5 in terms of a genealogical tree having 11. Ibid. 12.

The notion of immortality in Alexander is not clear, especially since he did not develop it in any detail. Thus, it is no surprise to find divergent interpretations of this concept in the literature on Alexander. The problem is aggravated by textual questions, especially those dif- ferences in language and emphasis found in the Arabic translation of Alexander's On the Intel- lect (Davidson, "Al-Farabi," pp. 119-21; Merlan, Monopsychism, pp. 16-17, 38-41). Whether Alexander allowed for immortality individuated according to each person's intel- lectual achievements is also not clear. Davidson argues that Alexander did not, since, on Davidson's interpretation, only the thought of the incorporeal forms is, for Alexander, immor- tal (Davidson, pp. 130 and 144, n. 239). 103</page><page sequence="6">SEYMOUR FELDMAN Gersonides 1.

By the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian theory of the intellect and its im- mortality, as it was developed by his commentators, became a standard doctrine of the philosophical world. But there was one feature of such a doctrine that proved troublesome. It appears that immortality could be purchased only at the price of giving up one's individual identity through union with the Agent Intellect. Averroes' formulation of the theory makes this consequence explicit. Averroes' influence was great, and in the Chris- tian world his views on immortality and intellection were vigorously debated and occasioned considerable controversy. Siger of Brabant, a "Latin Averroist," appears to have adopted Averroes' theory and was questioned by the papal court on this matter.'7 Averroes' doctrine of the in- 16.

Moses ofN arbonne (d. after 1362), for example, adopted the theory of conjunction and incor- porated it into his Treatise on the Soul.20 Gersonides, however, rejected this account of immortality, despite the deep influence Averroes had exerted upon him. Although he developed "radical" views on such issues as crea- tion, divine foreknowledge and miracles, on this topic Gersonides was more "conservative" than either Averroes or Moses of Narbonne, and perhaps even Maimonides.2' Before we begin our exposition of Gersonides' argument against the pos- sibility of conjunction, three methodological points should be mentioned. First, Gersonides develops his views out of a debate with specific philosophers, such as Alexander, Themistius and Averroes. Although he almost always mentions by name the participants in the debate and often cites the literary sources of their views, he himself had only minimal access to the standard medieval philosophical literature. Knowing neither Greek, Arabic nor Latin, at least to the extent of being able to read philosophical texts in these languages, he had to rely upon Hebrew translations for his knowledge of his philosophical predecessors. In fact, almost all his knowledge of Aristotle was derived from Averroes' commentaries, not from Aristotle himself.22 His acquaintance with the views of the Greek commen- 18.

The position of Maimonides on this question is not clear. It has been argued that he held a conjunction theory identical with or similar to that advanced by ibn Bajja, whose doctrine is Alexandrian in character (Alexander Altmann, "Ibn Bajja on Man's Ultimate Felicity," Harry Wolfson Jubilee Volume [Jerusalem, 1965], 1: 47-88; Shlomo Pines, introduc- tion to his translation of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed [Chicago, 1963], pp. ciii-civ). It is interesting to note that Gersonides makes no mention at all of Maimonides in his treatment of this topic, a surprising fact since he frequently discusses Maimonides' views and often criticizes them (David R. Blumenthal, "Maimonides' Intellectualist Mysticism," Studies in Medieval Culture 10 [1967]: 51-67). 22. Isaac Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia, 1948), pp. 329, 332.

Second, Gersonides' knowledge of Averroes' writings on the topic of conjunction was not complete. He did not know Averroes' Long Commen- tary on Aristotle's De anima.24 Nor was he familiar with Averroes' essay On The Possibility of Conjunction with the Agent Intellect, which was rendered into Hebrew in the year of his death 1344, nearly ten years after the comple- tion of his major philosophical work, The Wars of the Lord.25 Gersonides' discussions of Averroes' psychology were based upon Averroes' Middle Commentary on Aristotle's De anima (Moses ibn Tibbon translation), the Epitome of De anima, and his three short essays known collectively in Hebrew as "Three Letters." On the latter two works Levi wrote supercom- mentaries.26 In this discussion of Levi's presentation of Averroes' views, I have supplemented his citations from Averroes with references to the works that he did not know in order to indicate that his knowledge of Averroes, although not complete, was generally accurate. Third, the present analysis of Levi's critique of conjunction will depart somewhat from the structure of his own exposition. As does Levi, it begins with a general discussion of the nature of the intellect as this topic was con- ceived in the early Aristotelian tradition. In addition, I have distinguished two kinds of interpretations of Aristotle's psychology and, following Levi, Averroes has been located in the Themistian tradition. I now proceed to consider the thesis of conjunction, but this topic will be treated within the 23. The exceptions are: Themistius' Commentary on Book XII oJ Aristotle's Metaphysics, which had been translated into Hebrew in 1255; Al-Farabi's Treatise on the Intellect, translated into Hebrew in 1314; and Al-Ghazali's Intentions of the Philosophers, translated into Hebrew at the end of the thirteenth century (Georges Vajda, Isaac Albalag.- averroistejuiJ, traducteur et an- notateur d'AI-GhazdlF [Paris, 1960]). 24. The Long Commentary on De anima survives only in Latin translation and has been edited by F. S. Crawford in the Corpus commentariorum A verrois in Aristotelem published by the Medieval Academy of America in 1953.

Ac- cordingly, corresponding to the two theories of the intellect previously described, two different theories of conjunction deriving from them will be distinguished and considered. Levi himself does not differentiate these ac- counts of conjunction in this manner, although it was one of his criticisms of the Themistian-Averroistic theory of the intellect that suggested to me the method of analysis here adopted. In his writings, I have found the materials for fashioning a two-tined lance with which to assault the entire concept of conjunction as an explanation of immortality. One tine impales the notion of conjunction with the Agent Intellect in its Themistian-Averroistic form; the other tine impales the theory of conjunction with the Agent Intellect in its Alexandrian version. In Levi's own exposition we have initially a critique of the Themistian-Averroistic theory of the material intellect and then the rejection of the general claim of immortality as conjunction. Here his argu- ment is restructured within the framework of my distinction between Themistian and Alexandrian theories of intellection, from which I derive the two corresponding theories of conjunction, using Levi's analysis of the Themistian theory of the intellect as the basis for the critique of Themistian conjunction and his discussion of conjunction in general as the framework for the critique of Alexandrian conjunction. II The theory of Themistian-Averroistic conjunction consists of the follow- ing four theses. 1. The material intellect is ontologically identical with the Agent Intel- lect. This equation results from the fact that on this theory the material in- tellect is not merely a pure disposition, as Alexander had maintained, but is itself a separate substance or a dimension of a separate substance, i.e., the Agent Intellect. This equation stems from Themistius' reading of De anima 430a 13.27 For Themistius, both the material and Agent intellects are constitutive of the human intellect. The material intellect is a substance, and not a disposition; the Agent Intellect is immanent, a part of the human mind, as well as transcendent. Indeed, for Themistius, the nature and essence of man is con- stituted by the Agent Intellect. Whether there is, for Themistius, only one Agent Intellect or many such intellects subordinate to one primary Agent 27. Themistius, Paraphrasis, pp. 99-101, 103. 107</page><page sequence="10">SEYMOUR FELDMAN Intellect, as some scholars have suggested, is not clear.28 But in so far as we are all constituted by the Agent Intellect, as Themistius claims, we are reducible to the Agent Intellect. It would appear then that for Themistius the material intellect is relegated to the background as a secondary feature of our being subordinate to the Agent Intellect. Averroes, however, makes explicit the implicit identity, suggested by Themistius, between the material intellect and the Agent Intellect. For Averroes there is really only one intellect that is involved in think- ing, although this one intellect exhibits both receptive and active roles, or functions, or, as Alfred Ivry has put it, the Agent Intellect is "the substan- tiality of the material intellect."29 Since the Agent Intellect is clearly one for Averroes, it is equally evident that the material intellect is also one.30 It was this latter consequence in particular that elicited the critical response of Thomas Aquinas. 2. The Agent Intellect has a two-fold existence: a) it can exist by itself; b) it can be embodied in individual human beings. As the former it is the Agent Intellect in propria persona; as the latter it is the material intellect. Or, alter- natively formulated, when the Agent Intellect exists per se it is the Agent Intellect essentialiter, but when it is embodied in man, it is the material intel- lect accidentaliter.3' When the Agent Intellect is embodied in individual humans it is 'materialized' not only in the sense that it is found in a body, but also in the sense that it acquires objects of knowledge that are themselves instantiated in and derived from bodies. These are the 'material forms' as they are ap- prehended by some embodied intellect. By and in itself the Agent Intellect is capable of a very different kind of intellectual activity: self-cognition, which is its proper activity.32 28.

Every human mind is, therefore, a composite entity consisting of sense-images as stored in the imagination (0avirauara, nl':31'rn mnli) and the material intellect, or the Agent Intellect in its accidental guise. Or, ex- pressed differently, every human mind is a composite comprising a) sense- images and b) the material intellect, which in turn is a composite of a dis- position and a form, the Agent Intellect.33 Sharing one and the same intellect, each human mind is, therefore, dif- ferentiated by the sense-images it has acquired. The purely intellectual, or rational, component of the mind is common to all men. These individuating features are corporeal, deriving from sense-objects, and hence are transitory and corruptible.34 4. If the intellect in all human beings is ontologically one in number, and if mental individuation is a function of the sense-images, then when the lat- ter are not operative or are no longer in existence, there is no longer any in- dividuation. If immortality is construed as the survival of the intellect by means of conjunction with the Agent Intellect, this condition will be nonper- sonal, or nonindividual.35 These four theses constitute the main elements of the doctrine of the in- tellect and its immortality as developed by Averroes on the basis of Themis- tian themes. Now it should be observed that the Themistian-Averroistic thesis of conjunction is really a trivial consequence of these four postulates. Indeed, it turns out that conjunction is no more than the return of the Agent Intellect to its primordial and pristine state of separate existence, shorn of its embodiment in individual corporeal knowers. Given the initial Themistian- Averroistic equation of the material intellect with the Agent Intellect, the possibility of conjunction ceases to be a significant question. For on this ac- count of the matter conjunction necessarily occurs whenever the in- dividuating conditions that differentiate each human mind disappear or are no longer operative. Alternatively, conjunction is universally realizable because ab initio the material intellect is identical with the Agent Intellect. Themistius' claim that we are the Agent Intellect already suggests this equa- Gersonides, MH 1. 2, pp. 17-18; Supercommentary on Averroes' Epitome of De anima, MS Bodley Opp. Add. 4to, 38, fol. 246; Commentary on Averroes' Three Letters, ibid., fol. 263. 33.

The logic of the preceding remark underlies and supports Gersonides' first criticism of the Themistian-Averroistic doctrine of the intellect. For if everyone exhibits one and the same intellect, then when each of us dies or when the corporeal conditions that particularize one are no longer in force, all that remains is the Agent Intellect. 'Conjunction' has been paradoxically achieved by the elimination of one of the elements to be conjoined. For Ger- sonides this has the unhappy result that the intellectual achievements of one individual have made no difference in his attainment of immortality, since the latter condition is achieved no matter the level of intellectual perfection. Instead of spurring individuals to follow the life of the intellect, the Themistian-Averroistic doctrine would actually discourage them from this pursuit, since the goal to be reached is attainable by each and every person regardless of his intellectual efforts and accomplishments. Indeed, the very question or notion of conjunction becomes empty.36 Our problem turns out to be different from that which we had initially posed. We are no longer concerned with the possibility of conjunction, in the terms in which Averroes has formulated this question-a question which is now seen to be otiose; rather, we want to know whether the initial iden- tification of the material intellect with the Agent Intellect is plausible. It is this equation that endows Averroes' theory with its special flavor, and it is to this point that we must now turn. We shall see that Gersonides rejects this equation and follows instead Alexander's reading of Aristotle's discussion in De anima 3. 4-5. In criticizing the identification of the material intellect with the Agent Intellect, he marshalls several kinds of arguments, which for simplicity we shall categorize as metaphysical and epistemological. The fundamental metaphysical difficulty that Averroes' equation faces is a version of a basic problem in Plato's metaphysics. In the first half of the Parmenides, Plato exposes some of the latent difficulties of his own theory of 36.

Alfred Ivry has shown that in the essay On the Possibility of Conjunction with the Agent Intellect Averroes advanced the view that conjunction is attainable even in this life, albeit rarely and only briefly. As I have indicated earlier, Gersonides did not know of this work of Averroes and its special doctrine of this-life-conjunction. This latter idea might provide an Averroist with a way of meeting the above objection. But since for Averroes himself this-life-conjunction is only rarely attained, it could hardly serve as a goal that would excite even the intellectual elite (Alfred Ivry, "Averroes on Intellection," pp. 83-84). 110</page><page sequence="13">GERSONIDES ON AGENT INTELLECT the Forms. Plato points out that if a Form is believed both to be a unitary thing and at the same time to be manifested in many particular objects, it is not clear how the Form can preserve its unity and simplicity. The young Socrates attempts several solutions to this problem, but all dissolve under Parmenides' dialectic, and we are left in the dark as to whether Plato ever solved this problem. Now this is precisely Averroes' predicament. The Agent Intellect would be analogous to a Platonic Form: it is alleged to be one yet instantiable in the many without suffering any disintegration or loss of identity. But how can one be at the same time many? It would be many either in its role as Agent Intellect or in its role as material intellect. But if the former, then how can that which is ex hypothesi incorporeal be mul- tiplied without losing its specific identity? Incorporeal entities, for some of the Aristotelian medievals including Averroes, can be individuated only by type, or kind. If there are many incorporeal substances, they would each have to be specifically different, but the Agent Intellect is for Averroes one! But if the one intellect is diversified in its role as material intellect, then it would cease to be a separable intellect. For the diversification would result from material conditions, and this defines a body, not an incorporeal sub- stance. There is therefore, no way we can account for its multiple embodi- ments without either giving up its specific identity or its incorporeality.37 This Platonic perplexity becomes aggravated when we relocate it in an Aristotelian setting, for various features of Aristotle's philosophy make this problem even more vexing. Consider, for example, Averroes' characteriza- tion of the Agent Intellect as having the property of self-knowledge, a feature that is essential to it as Agent Intellect, and his characterization of the material intellect as having the essential property of knowing material objects. Now, according to Aristotle's theory of definition, any two things that are given two significantly divergent definitions are specifically dij- ferent, i.e., they belong to two different species, or kinds, and things that are specifically different are obviously numerically different. Yet Averroes' theory is committed to the claim that the Agent and material intellects are numerically one, and this entails that they must be specifically one. For how can two specifically different entities be numerically the same? Nevertheless, the two radically different cognitive operations of self-knowledge and em- pirical knowledge assigned respectively to the Agent Intellect and to the 37. Plato Parmenides 130a-135c.

For, as Aristotle and Gersonides like to stress, different functions are signs of dif- ferent forms or substances.38 When we introduce one of the basic metaphysical notions of Aristotle- the distinction between actuality and potentiality-, Averroes' theory becomes even less plausible. Remember that the original motive for in- troducing the Agent Intellect was the need for an active power that makes intellectual activity possible. It turns out, however, that for the theory under investigation, since the material intellect is identical with the Agent Intellect, this alleged active power is energizing itself! But for Aristotle one and the same entity cannot be both in potentiality and actuality with respect to the same activity. And if it is argued that the Agent Intellect is potential relative to empirical cognition but actual relative to self-cognition, and that the con- verse is true of the material intellect, then the Agent Intellect would possess an essential potentiality, which is inconsistent with its active function. Se- cond, it would imply some internal change within the Agent Intellect. Final- ly, the Agent Intellect is supposed to be a cause of human cognition, but if it is the material intellect under a different guise, it is the cause of itself insofar as it brings about its own potential empirical cognition! What has actually happened here is a transformation of the Agent Intellect into something that is considerably different. It is not merely a question of a change of garb. An essential change has taken place here which has not only engendered the previously cited defects, but is also unaccounted for. After all, who or what brings about the embodiment of the Agent Intellect? Or, how is it that the Agent Intellect is changed so that it is accidentally cognitive of material ob- jects, whereas previously it was essentially cognitive of itself? There is prima facie nothing implausible in a thing taking on new roles or activities. Yet un- less we are prepared to deny the law of causality, and certainly Averroes would not have denied it, we have here a transformation of character that needs to be explained. Shall we introduce another Agent Intellect?39 The theory of the Agent Intellect, let us recall, was originally introduced to explain cognition, and it is to this latter phenomenon that Gersonides' critique now turns. If the identity of the Agent Intellect and the material in- tellect is maintained, what kind of epistemological theory results? An ade- quate theory of knowledge ought to explain all or most of the salient facts of knowing. But there seem to be several common epistemological phenomena 38. Gersonides, MH 1. 4, pp. 27-28. 39. Ibid. 112</page><page sequence="15">GERSONIDES ON AGENT INTELLECT that are either falsified or are not captured by the Themistian-Averroistic theory of the intellect. Consider, for example, the all too human feature of error. Suppose A af- firms correctly p but B denies p. Yet, since A and B have, on Averroes' theory, the same intellect, B ought to affirm p!40 Averroes might reply that B lacks the relevant sense-data, and hence is not in the position to affirm p, the sense-data constituting for Averroes the differentiating constituent of each human mind.4' But it is quite frequent that two individuals have the same generic sense-data, yet one makes the correct judgment about them whereas the other does not. After all, Epicurus claimed that the sun is no bigger than a coin! Or, what about the case where A and B are such that A knows p, but B does not, i.e., B is ignorant of p? Since A and B have, on this theory, the same intellect, B ought to know p! And again, the presence or absence of the relevant sense-data will not account for the difference between A's and B's epistemic claims, for the sense-data are not always sufficient or necessary conditions for correct judgments. This is especially true in mathematics, where sense-data need not be used and different conclusions may be inferred by different people from the same set of premises. Finally, suppose A asserts p at ti, but B asserts q at ti, A and B having qualitatively the same set of rele- vant sense-data. For example, A looks at an object w and says that w is a fish, whereas B, looking at w, claims that it is a mammal. If they both have the same intellect and the same sense-data, how is this situation possible? These phenomena indicate that as an epistemological theory this doctrine is inadequate. Together with the metaphysical difficulties previously adduced, they make the Themistian-Averroistic theory of the intellect and its special version of conjunction untenable.42 We have seen that on the Themistian-Averroistic theory of the intellect it is not an interesting question to ask whether conjunction with the Agent Intellect is possible, since on this theory such conjunction is guaranteed ab initio. Given its psychological postulates the possibility of conjunction ceases to be a meaningful question, since conjunction is a state that is uni- versally and uniformly attained. It is otherwise with the Alexandrian ac- count of the intellect and its immortality. Instead of Themistius' interpreta- 40. Ibid., pp. 30, 33. 41. Averroes, Commentarium magnum, pp. 411-12.

Indeed, he mentions no Jewish philosophical works other than those of Maimonides. 113</page><page sequence="16">SEYMOUR FELDMAN tion of the material intellect as a substance and of the Agent Intellect as both immanent and transcendent, Alexander claimed that the former is only a disposition or capacity of the human organism to know and that the latter is a transcendent, incorporeal substance identical with God. Since as a disposi- tion this capacity for knowledge is a function of the human body, it ought to perish along with the corruption of the body. Yet for Alexander this is not so. In several passages, he suggests that under certain conditions the human intellect can attain immortality through some kind of attachment with the Agent Intellect, a notion that will be shortly analyzed. At the outset, it should be observed that on the Alexandrian account of conjunction this state takes place, if it occurs at all, only at the end of a specific kind of ac- tivity. It is a goal that some reach but others do not. This kind of conjunc- tion theory was also advanced by some of the medieval Muslim Aristotelians such as ibn Bajja and al-Farabi, at least in some of the latter's writings.43 Despite his general acceptance of Alexander's psychology and epistemology, Gersonides rejects even Alexandrian conjunction as a theory of human immortality.44 To understand the basis for his criticism of Alex- andrian conjunction it will be important to discuss briefly some key features of Gersonides' concept of the Agent Intellect. In Aristotle, the function of the Agent Intellect is to stimulate and bring about human intellectual activity. To some of the medievals the Agent Intel- 43.

Al-Farabi's views on this topic appear to have changed from an early affirmation of con- junction to a later denial of it. The belief in conjunction is found in his Al-madina al-fdaila [The Perfect State], ed. F. Dieterici (1896), p. 58 and in his Risdlafil-'aql [The Letter on the Intel- lect], ed. M. Bouyges (1938), p. 22. The latter has been translated in part and included in Hyman and Walsh, pp. 215-21. However, Al-Farabi rejects the possibility of conjunction in his later work, the Commentary on Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, as Averroes noted in his Com- mentarium magnum on De anima, pp. 433, 481, 485-86 (Davidson, "Al-Farabi," pp. 134-54). For ibn Bajja consult the previously mentioned items by Altmann and Merlan. For al-Kindi's views on this topic see Jean Jolivet, L'intellect selon Kindi (Liege, 1971). 44. It is even possible that at times Averroes himself and/or some of his disciples in the Jewish and Christian philosophical worlds also conceived or spoke of conjunction in Alex- andrian terms (Averroes, Commentarium magnum, pp. 450-51, 499; Hannes, Possibility oJ con- junction, pp. 50ff.). In the chapters where he criticizes specifically the notion of conjunction Gersonides groups Alexander, Themistius, Al-Farabi (in his Letter on the Intellect) and Averroes as all believing in immortality qua conjunction or union with the Agent Intellect (Gersonides, MH 1. 8-12). As we shall see, the criticisms that he levels against this notion are more pertinent to the framework of Alexander's psychology and the account of conjunction that is associated with it rather than to the psychological framework of Themistius and Averroes and the notion of con- junction that follows from it. Gersonides' criticisms of Themistian-Averroistic conjunction are embedded in his detailed criticism of the psychology from which it is derived. 114</page><page sequence="17">GERSONIDES ON AGENT INTELLECT lect assumed several additional roles, e.g., it was also regarded as the source of the forms for terrestrial substances or as the agent of generation of such substances. Aristotle himself suggested something like this in one of his biological works.45 Now either in its cognitive or generative capacity the Agent Intellect is not only an efficient cause but also a formal cause: it ex- emplifies in actuality that which the recipient of its influence has only in potentiality. The Agent Intellect is then a cause of knowledge because it pos- sesses in actuality the knowledge that it either stimulates in or dispenses to the material intellect.46 An analogue to this notion is the Logos of Philo. For Philo the Logos is the 'place of the Forms' or the 'intelligible world', which serves as a blueprint for the creation of the world. Although the primary task of Philo's Logos is cosmological rather than epistemological, it, like the Agent Intellect, serves as a formal cause of both knowledge and natural processes. Indeed, it is actually embodied in the universe as an 'immanent Logos'.47 Now the Logos and the Agent Intellect have at least one thing in common: they both function as plans. They have this role because they are, so to speak, the domicile for the Platonic Forms. Insofar as the latter are the ultimate patterns of rationality and order in the universe, they serve as the formal causes of both knowledge and generation. Indeed, these forms now become efficient causes because they exist in the mind of an active cause, the Agent Intellect. Thus, in Gersonides' version of the Agent Intellect theory, the force of one of Aristotle's criticisms of Plato's doctrine of the Forms has been blunted: for Aristotle Platonic Forms are not efficient causes, and hence are of no importance in explaining nature.48 But, Gersonides suggests, insofar as the Agent Intellect is an active force and insofar as the Agent Intellect possesses the Forms, these Forms are now efficient, as well as for- mal, causes.49 This view of the Agent Intellect is one that was held by Gersonides and other medieval thinkers. However, there are several respects in which his own account of the Agent Intellect departs from that of Alexander and from 45.

The medievals discussed the various kinds of knowledge that the Agent Intellect had, but they agreed that it did possess knowledge of the theoretical sciences of mathematics, the natural sciences and metaphysics (Averroes, Epitome on the Parva naturalia, trans.

First, unlike Alexander, Ger- sonides sharply distinguishes the Agent Intellect from God. The former is an incorporeal, transcendent, intellectual substance; but it is clearly subor- dinate to and derivative of God.50 Second, a common medieval view of the Agent Intellect maintained that this substance is the last link in the chain of separate, incorporeal intelligences, whose first member is God, each such in- telligence emanating from its predecessor.5' The Agent Intellect, emanating from the ninth intelligence, the mover of the sphere of the moon, is, however, not associated with any particular heavenly sphere; its "domain" is the terrestrial sphere, the world of man. Gersonides rejected one of the main features of this widely held theory. In his view, the Agent Intellect does not emanate from the ninth intelligence; rather, it emanates from all the other intelligences that function as movers of the heavenly bodies. This dif- ference is important. Whereas each of the separate intelligences that are movers of specific heavenly spheres is limited to its "sphere of influence" and apprehends that which emanates from its heavenly sphere alone, the Agent Intellect, since it emanates from all the latter intelligences, ap- prehends all that which they know only severally and partially. Thus, the knowledge possessed by the Agent Intellect is more comprehensive and systematic: it includes the whole plan exemplified in the sublunar world and apprehends this plan as a unified system. It is no wonder that the Agent Intellect occupies such an important role in Levi's philosophy.52 But despite its importance for Levi, we do not obtain immortality through conjunction with the Agent Intellect. Let us see why. In Alexander's version of conjunction, man attains immortality as the result of a long, arduous process of intellectual activity, terminating in un- ion (Evoats) with or assimilation (6oioiwoas) to the Agent Intellect. When this state is attained the human intellect becomes the Agent Intellect, for the former has achieved cognitive identity with the latter.53 Remember the Aristotelian epistemological axiom: in the state of knowing, the knower and 50.

Strictly speaking, it is the acquired intellect that for Alexander has achieved immor- tality. In the Wars of the Lord, Gersonides usually does not observe this verbal point, although in his supercommentaries he occasionally does (Gersonides, Supercommentary on Averroes' Three Letters, fol. 259). 116</page><page sequence="19">GERSONIDES ON AGENT INTELLECT the object of knowledge are identical.54 Now since the Agent Intellect is always knowing, it is always identical with its objects of knowledge, which are for Alexander the incorporeal forms (av'Xa edbsr). Since the latter are eternal, so is the former. But if the human intellect can apprehend these eter- nal forms, it will have become, by virtue of the above mentioned axiom, one with them, and hence acquire their incorruptibility. Or, since these forms are in some sense identical with the Agent Intellect, the human intellect will have become identical with the Agent Intellect. The Alexandrian version of con- junction is then a synthesis of both Platonic and Aristotelian elements, which is as it should be, since Aristotle's De anima passage is itself a Platonic heirloom.55 Gersonides rejects this theory. If it were possible for man to be suf- ficiently like the Agent Intellect in his cognitive operations and achieve- ments, it would be possible for him to attain a perfect apprehension of the Agent Intellect, and then identification with the Agent Intellect would result. But the antecedent of this conditional is false, and it is false because the material intellect is not like the Agent Intellect in some very important respects. First, the material intellect is significantly unlike the Agent Intel- lect in its cognitive operations. The material intellect is a potential knower that acquires knowledge successively, cumulatively, and intermittently. The Agent Intellect is an intellect that already possesses its knowledge, i.e., the Agent Intellect does not derive its cognitive capital by any accumulative process over time; its knowledge is coterminous with itself. Second, it is not only with respect to the way in which the material intellect gets its knowledge that it differs from the Agent Intellect; it differs also with respect to the nature of what it knows. The domain of human knowledge is the world of the 'material forms' (nrm'r,nn nmrnt;), i.e., those general natures (o,55:in Ovn, no), or essences, that are embodied in physical substances. By a process of abstraction from sense-data, we can apprehend this formal struc- ture. In this cognitive process the human intellect needs the cooperation of the Agent Intellect; but the latter is itself not for Levi the object of knowledge of the material intellect, nor is the Agent Intellect a sufficient condition for most types of knowledge. The object of knowledge is for us the formal structure of nature as it is embodied in physical substances ap- 54. Aristotle Metaphysics 12. 9 1074b39-1075al 1; Alexander, Commentary, pp. 90-91. 55.

In the natural sciences and even in metaphysics there is no short-cut to knowledge.56 Now this formal structure of nature exists as an object thought for the Agent Intellect, but in a dif- ferent manner. The Agent Intellect exemplifies these general natures in abstracto. these forms exist in the Agent Intellect in a departicularized and dematerialized manner. After all, the Agent Intellect is the 'home of the Forms'. True, there is, thanks to the divine plan for all reality, a conceptual isomorphism between the incorporeal Forms in the Agent Intellect and the material forms exhibited in physical substances. Yet, these two sets of forms are ontologically distinct: the former are ungenerated (except for creation) and incorruptible and are always the thought-objects of the Agent Intellect, whereas the latter are continuously generated and embodied in corruptible material objects and are intermittently apprehended by individual knowers.57 Finally, human knowledge is essentially incomplete and fragmentary. No matter how successful we are in our cognitive pursuits, we can never at- tain complete apprehension of the formal structure of the sublunar world, our domicile. To be sure, there are facts about this domain that are either of no interest or importance to us, and we can ignore them with impunity. Nevertheless, there are facts about our world that are of importance to us, but about which we are in ignorance for most of our life and perhaps always so. This is the human predicament. However, in the system of forms represented in the Agent Intellect, the plan of our world (rrv:inn n-mn) is complete. By virtue of the completeness of this plan the Agent Intellect ap- prehends all of the logical and causal relationships among the many sub- stances of nature. Thus, in the Agent Intellect this plan exhibits systematic unity, as well as conceptual completeness.58 Since, however, our knowledge of nature is incomplete, we cannot apprehend all the internal relations among natural phenomena, for without all the relevant data these relationships cannot be known.59 To illustrate this point, let us take an ex- ample from our own time. Consider an ecological life system wherein a cer- tain kind of insect, which is quite annoying to us, plays an essential role in the preservation of some other organism, which is very useful to us. Ignorant of this fact, we destroy the former animal at every opportunity. 56. Gersonides, Commentary on Song of Songs (K6nigsberg, 1860), pp. 2b, 9a, 20a. 57.

Our ignorance of the total system of biological phenomena proves to be harmful to ourselves. These various disparities between our intellect and the Agent Intellect pose, therefore, ineluctable obstacles to the attainment of the cognitive identity re- quisite for conjunction. Accordingly, conjunction is not possible.60 This limitation upon the cognitive capacity of man is nicely expressed in Gersonides' interpretation of Jacob's struggle with the angel in Genesis 32:30. After the angel had given Jacob a new name and wanted to depart, Jacob asked the angel to reveal his name. The angel replied, "Why do you ask me about my name?," and refused to disclose his identity. The denial on the part of the angel to comply with Jacob's request indicates to Gersonides both man's desire to know the essence of the Agent Intellect, i.e., to ap- prehend it fully and perfectly, and yet his inability to do so. Indeed, it is implied that apprehension of the Agent Intellect is not his goal, that human perfection is to be sought and attained by a different manner.61 The doctrine of conjunction with the Agent Intellect in its various forms is an example of a perennial philosophical-religious theme. In many tradi- tions man is always seeking to return to his source, and in those traditions in which the source is construed as divine, the goal is frequently formulated in the language of some kind of mystical contact or unification with some transcendent being. As some scholars have noted, this theme is also found in philosophical authors, and it is not always easy to distinguish between the philosopher and the mystic in a given text. In such a case any clear cut 60. In a few passages, Gersonides appears to admit the possibility of conjunction (Ger- sonides, MH 1. 4, p. 26; 4. 4, pp. 164-65; Supercommentary on A verroes' Epitome on De anima, fol. 250v). But a close examination of these passages reveals first that Gersonides usually adds a qualifying phrase, such as nxp, non T9K indicating that conjunction in the important sense, nml5wv mnlpri, is not admitted, and second that he is concerned only with what Merlan calls 'epistemological union', i.e., some epistemic relation between the human intellect and the Agent Intellect that transpires only in the act of cognition (Merlin, Monopsychosis, pp. 18-29). Ger- sonides' denial of conjunction in the sense of 'ontological union' is clearly expressed in the eighth lesson at the conclusion of his discussion of the pericope Shemot. There he says: "It is impossible for man to apprehend completely the Agent Intellect. ... In this some of the recent philosophers have erred, thinking that man could apprehend completely the Agent Intellect and become numerically one with it, and that herein lies human happiness ... and human im- mortality" (Gersonides, Commentary on Pentateuch, p. 56b). In the light of the last passage, as well as the argument of this paper, Vajda's claim that for Gersonides human perfection consists in "la jonction de l'Intellect Agent avec l'ame," or in the gradual elevation of "l'intellect hylique a l'union avec l'Intellect Agent" must be revised.

Philip Merlan's use of the phrase 'rationalistic mysticism' in this context is quite apt.62 Gersonides' critique of immortality as conjunction with the Agent Intellect can accordingly be regarded as a defense of philosophy against the encroachment of mysticism. If the latter is generally characterized by the aim to achieve some kind of unio mystica-whether ec- static or not is immaterial-, Gersonides rejects this whole enterprise. His goal is more modest. Man is to devote himself not to the union with some supernal being but to the acquisition of what is humanly attainable: knowledge of the world in which he lives. This is possible by virtue of and through cooperation with the Agent Intellect, but it does not require iden- tification with it.63 Indeed, beyond the Agent Intellect there is another Intel- lect that is the source of truth and being to which the Agent Intellect is sub- ordinate. This is the First Intellect, or God.64 As a good Jew, Gersonides could not accept any idea of identification with God. If conjunction is al- leged to be our goal, we might as well go all the way. But since we cannot, why posit this as a goal at the outset? In Book 6 of the Republic, Plato suggested that truth and being are made possible by the Form of Goodness, which is not only distinct from all par- ticular instances of goodness but from all other Forms. True, Forms serve as the patterns of order and intelligibility for our physical world, but they are ontologically and epistemologically distinct from it. The immutability essen- tially possessed by each Form is not even accidentally shared by any par- ticular; the perfection of each Form is at best only approximated asymp- totically by any particular. No identification with a Form is then possible for a particular. In these respects, Gersonides' Agent Intellect is like Plato's Form of the Good. No union with the Agent Intellect is possible or neces- sary, no more than it is possible or necessary for Plato's philosopher-king to become one with a Form. For both Plato and Gersonides, human happiness consists in the pursuit and attainment of human wisdom, a goal that leads man to recognize the existence of some transcendent entities that are needed for the achievement of his quest. But this goal does not terminate in the obliteration of the self in a transcendent being. 62. Merlan, Monopsychism, pp. 20ff.; Altmann, "ibn Bajja," pp. 70, 87. 63.
