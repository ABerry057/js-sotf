Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003. 362 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000487 '"The Nazi conscience,'" asserts historian Claudia Koonz in the opening sentence of her book of the same title, "is not an oxymoron" (1). In this important study of how the Nazi regime and thousands of "ordinary Germans" perpetrated unprecedented acts of genocide, Koonz argues that the regime developed and dis seminated an exclusionary and racist "ethnic fundamentalism" to the public during the crucial peacetime years from 1933 to 1939, thus laying the groundwork for systematic mass murder in wartime. Such preparation was necessary, as pre 1933 Germany was among the least antisemitic countries in Europe. The tiny German Jewish minority, moreover, was becoming increasingly assimilated, and it was apparent early on to Nazi leaders that most non-Jewish Germans rejected the crude and bullying antisemitism of the Brownshirts and gutter Nazi press. Therefore, a change in public attitudes?both collective and individual?was necessary if the regime was to realize its goal of a "racially pure" Volksge meinschaft. The work of formulating and popularizing a new "Nazi" conscience fell mainly to mid-level Nazi bureaucrats, jurists, and medical scientists and the nation's academic elite. By the outbreak of the war in 1939, Koonz concludes, 218</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Germans were prepared "to expel Jews from their universe of moral obligation as a consequence of their acceptance of knowledge disseminated by institutions they respected" (272). Koonz begins with an examination of Hitler's role as a "prophet of virtue" (17). Hitler offered Germans not only hatred and resentment but also a kind of idealism?a promise to restore virtue, honesty, and community. He made, in other words, a moral claim on authority. As is well known, he managed his public persona with meticulous care and distanced himself personally from the largely unpopular violence of the storm troopers against Jews. But it would not be Hitler who would fill out the particulars of the Nazi conscience. The job of forging the new "communal spirit" (87) of which he spoke was left to the bureau cratic, legal, and scientific elite inside and outside the Nazi Party. It was stage managed by the Propaganda Ministry, popularized by proliferating community organizations and by the National Socialist Teachers League, codified in law by Nazi jurists, and given an aura of scientific authority by the medical community and a slew of new academic institutes. The effect, she suggests, was to allow "mod erate Germans to rationalize their support for Nazi mle. They could become 'yes but' Nazis?welcome ethnic fundamentalism and economic recovery while dis missing Nazi crimes as incidental" (102). Koonz profiles several key figures in this campaign, an exemplary figure being the young physician Walter Gross. In April 1933, Gross, just 29 years old, was appointed to head the National Socialist Office for Enlightenment on Population Policy and Racial Welfare. Gross's job was to popularize an "ethnic consciousness" that justified the Nazi's eugenics program and sought to set Jews outside the "Volk" racially. Gross headed a national network of thousands of "race educators" who gave speeches, churned out pamphlets, films, and maga zines, and hosted workshops for teachers. Here, the author contributes to recent research by Ulrich Herbert, Michael Wildt, and Lutz Niethammer on the importance to the regime of what Wildt has labeled the Generation des Unbedingten (roughly, the "generation of those without limits"). These men were bom too late to have fought in World War I, though some were old enough to have belonged to quasi-official right-wing paramilitary units, or "Free Corps." Their formative years were spent watching the Weimar Republic unravel. Often highly educated (a substantial number of mid-ranking Sicherheitsdienst officers earned doctorates in law, political science, and literature), their introduction to National Socialism often came through the Nazi student movement. They combined a radical political ethos and bureaucratic capabilities that were suited perfectly to the regime's needs, and they rapidly staffed the ranks of the Sicherheitsdienst of the SS and other key ministries. Many also enjoyed successful careers in postwar West Germany (in a grotesque irony, one member of this group, the former S S officer Hans R?ssner, became Hannah Arendt's editor fox Eichmann in Jerusalem). Gross falls into this category. Bom in 1904, he joined the Nazi Party in 1925 while studying with some of the most prominent "race scientists" at G?ttingen. He quickly demonstrated the combination that made members of his generation such effective desk- and 219</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews lectem-bound race warriors: unwavering ideological commitment and effective bureaucratic management skills (and in Gross's case, a talent for public lecturing). Gross's efforts were complemented by hundreds of jurists and university professors representing every academic discipline. Recent research has revealed the extensive complicity of Germany's academic elite in supporting the regime with its considerable public prestige and expertise (an observation made, it should be noted, as early as 1946 by the Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich and even earlier in Victor Klemperer's diary entries). This is not to say that Germany's professors marched in lockstep with the regime on all matters. Koonz points out that scholars quarreled over such fundamental issues as the definition of race. But such disagreements aside, hundreds of professors in what were then the world's greatest universities undertook large-scale research projects on racial matters. Koonz argues that "the scholarly tone" of such efforts "combined with media attention, rationalized the 'orderly' removal of Jews from mainstream society and underwrote the consensus that Jews had no place in Germany" (202). In the debate about the origins of the Holocaust, Koonz places herself between those who have identified an unwavering intention to kill Jews systema tically and those who see genocide reached in stages, propelled forward by bureau cratic considerations, local initiatives, and the unforeseen course of the war. For Koonz, ideology, bureaucracy, and contingency are cmcial. Hitler set the broad parameters of policy and made "prophetic" pronouncements while a vast bureauc racy of specialists such as Gross "worked toward" the F?hrer's wishes, as Ian Kershaw characterized this dynamic, by attempting to make "ethnic fundamental ism" acceptable to a majority of non-Jewish Germans. Koonz thus offers an expla nation of "the process by which a genocidal consensus evolved among proponents of a relentless bureaucratic war against Jews in Germany" (130). But to what extent did a "Nazi conscience" take hold of the wider public? How effective were Gross's efforts and those of legions of professors and propagandists in forging a "Nazi con science" among "ordinary Germans?" Koonz's study is less successful at addressing this question. It is clear that the regime sought a fundamental change in the values that formed the civic and personal bonds between individuals. It is also clear that thousands of highly edu cated Germans undertook this effort with formidable determination. It worked to a certain extent, Koonz points out, as contemporary surveys of morale "reported the growing gulf between Jewish and non-Jewish Germans" (218). On the other hand, she cites numerous instances of public rejection or at least half-hearted acquies cence to the "Nazi conscience." More research on the reception of the efforts she describes is necessary. But when Victor Klemperer noted in his diary that a non-Jewish friend spoke to him "as a dying man" (255), the reader understands that the work of the "ethnic fundamentalists" had made some inroads among its intended targets.
