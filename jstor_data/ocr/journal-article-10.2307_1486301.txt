<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN COHEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF SPINOZA: A REAPPRAISAL by FRANZ NAUEN University of Haifa The audacious goal of Hermann Cohen's philosophy of religion is to reconcile Judaism and modern culture. Interest in Cohen's Jewish writings, especially his posthumous Religion der Vernunft,' both on the part of Jewish scholars and the English and Israeli reading public, bears witness to its last- ing significance. For the contemporary reader, the value of Cohen's project is, it appears, not canceled even by the historic fact that the Holocaust proved Cohen's messianic dream tragically-even obscenely-out of phase with the grim reality of modern Germany. As Ernst Simon pointed out, Cohen was not the only sage to follow "a false prophet"; Maimonides, for example, found nothing wrong with Rabbi Akiba's fateful allegiance to Bar Kochba.2 The best scholarship on Cohen has therefore rightly concerned itself with the nature of Cohen's achievement as a philosopher of Judaism rather 1.

Especially prominent in the discussion of Cohen's achievement has been the question whether Cohen's philosophy of Judaism as articulated in Religion der Ver- nunft was consistent with the New Kantian premises of his philosophical system or whether it was based on logical, metaphysical, ethical or religious presuppositions inconsistent with it. Put more boldly, was Cohen's thought seen as a whole internally consistent or might Cohen the New Kantian phi- losopher be distinguished from Cohen the Jew?3 The scholarship of S. H. Bergman, Nathan Rotenstreich, Leo Strauss and Alexander Altmann on Cohen was in fact an in depth response to the existentialist interpretation, persuasively put forward by Franz Rosenzweig in 19244 and refined by Ernst Simon in 1933,5 that a conversion, homecom- ing to Judaism or existential moment occurred during the last phase of Cohen's career sometime between 1907 and 1915. Still widely accepted by most students of Cohen, this thesis has contributed to the subordination and neglect of all of Cohen's systematic philosophical writings including his magnum opus, Ethik des reinen Willens, published in 1904;6 Religion der Vernunft, published posthumously in 1919 is, in fact, Cohen's only major work translated into English or Hebrew.' And though Rosenzweig certainly intended to enhance our appreciation of Cohen's human stature, an inescap- able consequence of his interpretation is some suspicion regarding the rigorousness of Cohen's philosophizing and the validity of his basic philo- sophical ideas.

In two learned articles, however, "Hypothesis in the Philosophy of Hermann Cohen"'t and "Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone and Religion of Reason,""'' unfortunately less familiar to the general public, Bergman and Rotenstreich argued for a high degree of con- tinuity and logical consistency in Cohen's philosophical development, as did also Alexander Altmann in his essay, "Hermann Cohens Begriff der Kor- relation."'2 In the following, this "revisionist" argument for the system- atic unity of Cohen's thought, based on research into the development of his philosophical concepts, will be supported by a reinterpretation of Cohen's critique of Spinoza, seen by Rosenzweig and Simon as conclusive evidence for the bifurcation of philosophy and Judaism in Cohen's late thought. A close study of the organic development of Cohen's argument for the basic opposition between ethical idealism and Spinozean pantheism from 1877 onward leads us to question the view that Cohen's critique of Spinoza in his lecture of 1910, "Spinozas Verhdiltnis zum Judentum,"'3 and his essay of 1915, "Spinoza fiber Staat, Religion, Judentum and Christentum,"'4 is evi- dence of existential crisis and intellectual discontinuity. This suspicion is strengthened by the fact that alternative data to that of Rosenzweig and Simon can be brought forward to explain the unprecedented violence of Cohen's attack on Spinoza from 1910 onwards. In the "Preface" to Reden iiber das Judentum, published in 1923, Martin Buber mentioned that Cohen in his "last and most significant book," Reli- gion der Vernunft, had mistakenly inferred that God could have no reality from the fact that the notion "reality" implied the relationship between knowledge and sensation. Against this Buber argued not only that God should become real, i.e., enter the world of sensation, but also that Cohen had wrongly made the distinction between feeling and thinking absolute."5 While Buber was correct in thinking that Cohen maintained that God can 10.

This irreconcilable opposition between ethical ideal- ism and pantheism was moreover not unique to Religion der Vernunft, as Buber suggested, but a persistent theme which Cohen flatly called in Ethik des reinen Willens the difference between "truth and error" (Richtigkeit und Falschheit).'18 This incisive judgment underlay Cohen's critique of Spinoza, the most profound and influential of all modern pantheists. Spinoza's basic equa- tion, "God or Nature" (Deus sive natura) is diametrically opposed to Cohen's starting point in all of his ethical writings, beginning with the first edition of Kants Begrfindung der Ethik,'9 published in 1877: a clear-cut dis- tinction between the "Being" of nature and the "Should" of Ethics. Already in this work, Cohen's first attempt to formulate a Neo-Kantian ethical theory, Spinoza's Ethics were interpreted as a "false beginning" which ob- scured the basic distinction between the "Ought" and the "Is," between the "supersensual" ethical idea and other transcendental ideas. This question, however, is not raised. Whether just as the material world appears in the forms of human interaction, so also the Ethical is a thing in it- self, has a Being which also only appears in human willing, in Action as in Passivity. Still, however much one may resist the thought for "enlightened reasons," this is the ethical question: the possibility of another kind of validity for a Supersensual. In conceiving of this problem in this way, the founder of transcendental ideas stands next to the creator of the theory of Ideas. Since 16. Religion, p. 187, 17. Religion, pp. 187-88. 18.

Ethics must teach, according to Kant, what should be.20 This motif, the contrast between ethical idealism as conceived of by Plato and Kant and Spinoza's pantheism, was embellished in Ethik des reinen Willens, Cohen's ethical masterwork, published in 1904, where Spinoza's naturalistic analogy between human emotions and behavior and geometric points and lines was portrayed as the reason for Kant's anti- pathy to Spinoza. Kant's obvious antipathy to Spinoza, more than to any other philosopher, stems from a factual difference of principle. Spinoza enchants his reader by his tranquility and sublimity regarding prejudice and dominant opinion. He takes on the appearance of antique nakedness as he puts human passions and ac- tions on the level of mathematical figures. Such an attitude deserves respect when one is dealing with prejudices in the battle of opinions and parties. It contradicts however the possibility of ethics as created by Plato.2' This counterpositioning of Spinoza and Kant is however only part of the story. A clue to Cohen's most serious opinion can be found in his conten- tion that Spinoza was responsible for the pantheistic leanings of the post- Kantian Idealists, especially Schelling and Hegel.22 If, however, Kant had refuted dogmatic metaphysics once and for all, how can the vogue of Spi- nozistic ideas among the post-Kantians be understood?23 Cohen's explana- tions for this are not altogether convincing. For according to Cohen such a reversion to pre-Kantian thought structures could only be partially explained by either the romantic openness of the Idealists to history24 or by their reaccommodation to a Christian theological tradition itself pro- foundly affected by pantheism.25 20.

This is not a valid question for the historian of ideas who may safely conclude that Kant criticized dogmatic metaphysicians, including Spinoza and Mendelssohn for trying to prove what is only a rational "orientation." It is a great difficulty for Cohen who devoted much of his time to the project of showing that Kant at his best rejected not only the dogmatic claims of the metaphysicians but also the substance of their discourse. 24. Ethik, pp. 306-7. 25. Ibid., pp. 305-9.</page><page sequence="6">116 FRANZ NAUEN The pantheistic roots of classical idealism must lie deeper, perhaps in Kant's philosophical thought. And if we follow Cohen's most illustrious student, Ernst Cassirer, in insisting that belief in a "thing in itself" under- lying both phenomena and moral action was an incontestable component of Kant's philosophical thought, we may conclude with some safety that Cohen held Spinoza responsible for this residual pantheism in Kant's thought.26 Though Cohen preferred to interpret away Kant's concept of a "thing in itself' rather than take it seriously,27 the historical connection be- tween it and classical idealism would explain the curious fact that at the apex of his argument in Ethik des reinen Willens, Cohen forwent his usual contrast of Spinoza and Kant. Instead, Spinoza's equation of God and Nature was contrasted to the God Idea of true monotheism which, tran- scendent to both Nature and the Ethical Will, unites both. Following this line of reasoning in which logic rather than content unites ethics and science, Spinoza's pantheism based on an identity of God and Nature was distin- guished from Ethical idealism where God "correlates" to both Man and Nature.28 Though this veiled critique of Kant only came to the fore at an ad- vanced stage of Cohen's ethical thought, remarkable nonetheless is the unchanging framework of Cohen's critique of Spinoza's pantheism from 1877 until his death. Often implicit in the first edition of Kants Begriindung der Ethik, embellished and polished in Ethik des reinen Willens (1904) and Religion der Vernunft (1919), the four major points of this critique can already be found in the first edition of Kants Begruindung der Ethik (1877). First, Spinoza's formula, Deus sive natura, preempts the possibility of philosophical ethics by precluding the being of the Ought.29 Second, Spi- noza's view of human behavior as akin to points and lines is incompatible with the methodology of ethics.30 Third, philosophical ethics requires the notion of a God Idea, transcendent to both nature and private ethics and 26. "In fact, every purely historical reproducer of Kant's system must realize that Kant on the matter did not succeed in distingluishing clearly between the methodological and the onto- logical problem," Ernst Cassirer, "Hermann Cohen und die Erneuerung der Kantischen Phi- losophie," Kant-Studien 17 (1912): 252-73; esp. p. 268. 27.

Spinoza's God, however, is immanent and not transcendent. Fourth, Spinoza's key concept affectus is mistaken insofar as Spinoza supposed that affects are either to be subject to the ex- ternal discipline of reason (Kants Begrindung der Ethik [A])32 or suppressed entirely (Ethik).33 Affect is, however, a motor which receives its form from reason.34 The only novelty in Ethik was Cohen's charge that Spinoza's pan- theism was ethically and politically barren because he, comparing "compas- sion" to envy, overlooked its pivotal importance as the source of love of one's fellow man.35 The absence of this charge in Kants Begrindung der Ethik (A) is not surprising inasmuch as Cohen believed that compassion and brotherly love pertained not to ethics but to religion,36 the ethical impor- tance of which he himself played down before 1900.31 Highly critical of Spinoza's metaphysical ideas, Cohen until 1910 none- theless paid tribute on a variety of occasions to Spinoza's historical achieve- ment. He acknowledged that Spinoza was a great Jew who had contributed to enlightenment in religion and politics,38 that his philosophy completed the course of medieval philosophy initiated by Philo,39 and that his notion of "affect" while philosophically misleading was in keeping with the normative Jewish tradition.40 Only after 1910 does one find in Cohen's writings a per- sonal attack on Spinoza as an elitist, blind to the potential of the "Menge" for enlightenment,4' to the Messianism of the prophets,42 and to the Jewish monotheistic idea.43 This blindness leads to defamation of Maimonides,44 31.

Can the former be dissociated from changes in Cohen's thought taken as a whole? Cohen himself on occasion, after 1910, associated Spinoza's pan- theism with modern antisemitism of which Spinoza was, Cohen believed, a major literary source, especially effective and malignant, since Spinoza was considered by such giants as Kant to be an expert on Jewish matters.48 Per- haps Cohen's philosophical critique of Spinoza and his personal attack on him are not only intertwined but inseparable. Perhaps Cohen's unprece- dented animosity toward Spinoza in his lecture of 1910, "Das Verhaltnis Spinozas zum Judenthum,"49 and in his essay of 1915, "Spinoza fiber Staat und Religion, Judenthum and Christentum,"so was the consequence of a crucial change in Cohen's underlying philosophical position. Both Franz Rosenzweig and Ernst Simon eloquently argued that a revolution in Cohen's outlook was in fact the underlying cause of Cohen's polemic against Spinoza in his writings from 1910 onwards. Upon close scrutiny, however, their arguments do not appear to be altogether convincing. Rosenzweig, in his "Einleitung" to Hermann Cohens Jiidische Schriften, published in 1924, interpreted the final phase of Cohen's thought as a "homecoming to Judaism" as a religion of reason with its own hypotheses and subject matter."5 According to this interpretation Cohen in his old age could be considered to be a precursor of the "New Thinking" which Rosen- zweig himself expounded in Stern der Erl6sung. Though Rosenzweig did not make this explicit in "{Jber den Vortrag Hermann Cohens' Das Verhailtnis Spinozas zum Judenthum," it is clear that he considered the biting attack on 45. J.S., 3: 366. 46.

To explain this sudden change, Simon argues that sometime between 1907 and 1910, Cohen felt called upon to forgo his philosophical impartiality and think through his own existence as a Jew committed to his ancestral tradition.57 To support his argument, Simon referred to remarks by Cohen which do not relate directly to Spinoza, a remark in a letter writ- ten in 1907 that he had "sacrificed his sentimentality to his philosophy."58 The second, a remark made also in 1907, praised Spinoza for loyalty to his Sephardic tradition as expressed in his reading only Spanish literature.59 52.

Cohen, in fact, in 1910, in KBE,B, not only rejects unambiguously the possibility of a philosophically based religion of reason-the project of Begriffder Religion (1915) and Religion der Vernunft (1919), but also rejects religion's compatibility with philosophy: "Ethics is philo- sophy.

I am not convinced. No reader of Cohen's post- humous Religion of Reason can in justice claim that Cohen had decided to forgo reason. The best evidence for both Rosenzweig's and Simon's theses can be found not in extraneous material but in Cohen's essay on Spinoza it- self. (To be fair to Simon, he did not explicitly deny this.) Leo Strauss in his early article "Cohens Analyse der Bibelwissenschaft Spinozas" in Der Jude convincingly argued that Spinoza's Tractatus is interpretable within the con- text of the climate of opinion in which it was written and within the context of Spinoza's entire philosophy without ascribing to him any untoward malevolence to Judaism.60 Cohen's charge that Spinoza had liberated him- self not only from the Jewish community but from the monotheistic God Idea and that he was motivated by a need for revenge for the excommuni- cation levied against him by the elders of the Amsterdam community is technically unfair and unjust, though understandable in light of Cohen's strong sense of Jewish identity.6' Strauss then agreed with Simon that Cohen's attack was provoked less by philosophical issues than by religious and national feeling. Rosenzweig and Simon, exponents of "a new thinking," saw a precursor in Cohen in his final phase. Cohen the classical philosopher of Liberal Juda- ism had to be distinguished from Cohen the existential theologian by a con- version, be it between 1907 and 1910 with a "Mitdenken der eigenen Exis- tenz"62 Or in 1915 in the exposition of Judaism as a religion of reason.63 To support such an interpretation, Cohen's attack on Spinoza from 1910 on- ward was brought forward as evidence. My explanation of Cohen's animosity to Spinoza from 1910 onwards, on the other hand, is less speculative and more empirical than that of Rosen- zweig or Simon, though compatible with what Leo Strauss had to say. Until 1904, Cohen was concerned exclusively with Spinoza's philosophical ideas as articulated in Ethics. There is, in fact, only slight evidence to suggest that he had even looked at any of Spinoza's political writings.64 In 1904, he re- 60. Der Jude 8: 295-314; esp. pp. 299, 314. 61. Ibid., p. 314. 62.

Freudenthal's Spinoza, sein Leben und seine Lehre for the Literarische Zentralblatt.65 From Freudenthal, Cohen became acquainted with the complexity of the personal motives which prompted Spinoza to write the Tractatus theologicus politicus, though there is no evidence that he bothered to reread it carefully. During the same year, in Ethik des reinen Willens, obviously thinking of Jews, both members of a religion and displaced ethnic persons, he stressed that it was a moral duty not only to participate in the idealization of one's own religious heritage but also to maintain perpetual love and affection for one's people and one's original homeland.66 In 1908, in "Characteristik der Ethik Maimonis,"67 the fruit of a close reading of part three of the Guide for the Perplexed, he reconsidered Spinoza's role in medieval Jewish philosophy. "Idealized," it need not be understood as a pantheistic tradition beginning with Philo and ending with Spinoza, but could be seen as reaching its peak in Maimonides, with his ethical emphasis closer to Kant than Spinoza.68 It was, however, the range of problems which came to the fore during the composition of the new "fourth part" of the second edition of Kants Begriindung der Ethik69 which decisively affected Cohen's understanding of Spinoza. In discussing Kant's philosophy of law, religion and history-the topic of the new fourth part-Cohen developed the point already made in Ethik des reinen Willens that Kant, in spite of some promising beginnings, had failed to ground transcendentally the "Geisteswissenschaften."70 More specifically, by distinguishing sharply between the metaphysical roots of law and the philosophy of religion, Kant had overlooked, for understandable reasons, the fact that both were united in "World History" where the uni- versal messianic state integrated the law and religious value.7' Instead Kant treated separately the real modern state, based on the natural law, and an favorable assessment of Jesus in "Zur Verteidigung" (1888), ibid., p. 97. Both are allusions to commonplaces and might well be derivative, not based on a first hand exposure to Spinoza's political writings. 65.

Instead, following a pattern with which we have already become familiar, Cohen contrasted Kant's ethi- cally based theory of natural law with that of Spinoza, based on a "meta- physical" or even "mystical" definition of the natural individual as part of God.73 For, according to Kant, Cohen argued, "Man should receive his right from reason and history and not as a part of God, whereby he is equally a beast."74 In addition, Kant was certainly not influenced by Spi- noza's basic contention that the equation of nature and power not only was the fundamental law of nature but also the foundation of political power. Kant also rejected Spinoza's brutal schism between revealed religion and philosophy, on the one hand, and religious values and political philosophy, on the other.75 Cohen did, however, hold Spinoza fully responsible for Kant's condemnation of Judaism: "Kant was committed to the moral emphasis of Rousseau. Spinoza never succeeded in tearing him away from this ethical or religious ambiance. More dangerous was Spinoza's in- fluence-not on Kant's concept of religion, but on his assessment of the original form of religion, biblical Judaism, where Kant was dependent on Spinoza's research."''76 This new political and religious dimension of Cohen's critique of Spi- noza referred however, now for the first time, not to Spinoza's Ethics but to his Tractatus politicus77 and Tractactus theologicus politicus.78 Cohen, prompted both by the specific subject matter of the "fourth part" of Kants Begriindung der Ethik and by the appearance of a new German translation of the Tractatus theologicus politicus in the prestigious Philosophische Biblio- thek,79 now read these political readings in the critical Latin edition of Van Vloten and Land. Responding to this new input, Cohen contrasted Spinoza to Kant who had remained loyal to his pietistic origins.s0 He argued that Spinoza, full of "unconcealed hate""' of Judaism, lacked entirely the ethical 72.

He found that the author of the Tractatus theologicus politicus was essentially disloyal. The first philosopher to reject his ancestral tradition,88 Spinoza was a "renegade to his people,"89 an "apostate" who preferred Christianity to Judaism.90 This "humanly incomprehensible betrayal"9' was encouraged by philo- sophical premises which stressed an eternal cleavage between an elite cap- able of philosophical insight and the masses for whom religion was the only suitable kind of edification.92 Blind to the messianic idea of the prophets, the meaning of the Jewish Sabbath, the psalms and Jewish prayer,93 Spinoza's pantheism was a formalism based on the eternal contrast between know- ledge for an elite and religious training for the lower classes of society for whom Spinoza had nothing but contempt.94 Spinoza in short was indifferent to the central problem of modern politics: human equality.95 Even more pernicious than Spinoza's political teachings was his role as a 82.

This "great enemy who came out of our ranks" "prosecuted" Judaism in front of the Christian world.96 Through "a defect of his ethical and religious es- sence,"97 he failed to understand Moses and the prophets and, even worse, suppressed the universalism of the Jewish theory of natural law, the "fundamental idea" of Jewish monotheism by disingenuously misinterpret- ing Maimonides.98 Aware, however, that Spinoza's philosophical position was already established before his excommunication from the Amsterdam Jewish community, Cohen concluded that Spinoza's pantheism was a par- tial if not sufficient explanation of his political and religious thought.99 Mistaken in his philosophical premises, Spinoza had "liberated" himself not only from Judaism but from the monotheistic idea.'00 Some kind of relation- ship between pantheism and the most malignant symptom of cultural crisis, antisemitism, may in fact exist.'0' Consequently, in his writings from 1914 onward, Cohen associated Spinoza, the renegade whom he had come to know through a reading of the two Tractates, with Spinoza, the philosopher whom he had always criticized incisively but without vituperation. The critique of Spinoza in Religion der Vernunft and in other writings of Cohen's final period, while substantially consistent with his earlier writings, was now no longer a contest of philosophical opinions but a holy war against an enemy to whom no quarter may be given, a battle not only between truth and falsehood but between good and evil.102 This was however an intrinsic response to Cohen's experience of Spinoza in perfect consistency with the otherwise gradual evolution of his philosophical and religious ideas. 96.
