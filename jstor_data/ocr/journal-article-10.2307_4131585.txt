Cincinnati, Hebrew Union College Press, 1999. 97 pp. 172</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In this slim yet analytically sophisticated volume, Kartun-Blum, professor of Hebrew literature at Hebrew University, seeks to elucidate the "noisy existence" of the modern Hebrew poet who is forced to contend with the echoes of tradition- al texts and the multiple, diachronic registers of the revived Hebrew language. The work consists of three chapters, the first of which, "The Prophet's Tongue in Our Cheek," serves as an introduction to the use made of the Bible in modem Hebrew poetry. Building on this framework, in the second and longest section of the book, she engages the motif of the Binding of Isaac, and in the last chapter she offers a reading of a poem by Yona Wallach. In her analysis, she incorporates the insights to be gleaned from the perspectives of intertextuality, deconstruction, and feminist criticism. This book is based on the Efroymson Lectures delivered by the author at Hebrew Union College in 1995, although the core of the thesis developed in the chapter on the Binding of Isaac motif appeared in Prooftexts (September 1988). In the introduction, Kartun-Blum points out one of the central paradoxes of modem Hebrew literature: Despite the iconoclastic stance of many Israeli poets vis- a-vis the traditional texts ("the sources"), they cannot ignore the tradition. In thus confronting the canonical works, they continue the long Jewish tradition of en- gagement with text, and specifically, the metatextual practice of midrash. Howev- er, while the rabbinic authors of midrash exult in their "belatedness" and are at pains to show how their readings emerge from the text, the relationship of the secular Is- raeli poet is typically one of subversion based on strong and often ironic or parod- ic "misreadings." Kartun-Blum brings up Harold Bloom's notion of the "anxiety of influence"-the oedipal struggle of strong poets with their precursors. She also highlights the special role the Hebrew language, with the productive morphology of its root system, plays in the generation of punning, intertextual connections. Perhaps the biblical theme that has most preoccupied Hebrew writers is the Binding of Isaac. Over the centuries, as Shalom Spiegel demonstrated in his mas- terful work, The Last Trial, the biblical story has been interpreted typologically as prefiguring Jewish martyrdom, particularly during the persecutions of the Cru- sades. Kartun-Blum demonstrates the centrality of this martyrological motif with- in the formation of a Zionist master narrative that is in turn reflected and refract- ed in the treatment of this motif by Israeli artists in a variety of media. (Menashe Kadishman, who has returned repeatedly to this theme in his oeuvre, has provid- ed the original illustrations that adorn this book.) In her chapter on this topos, Kar- tun-Blum traces the ways in which the deconstruction of the Aqedah myth can be read as a road map of the culture's ideological shifts that "lays bear the secrets of the collective Israeli psyche" (p. 19). While the heroic image of self-sacrifice of the halutsim characterized the earlier literature of Zionist commitment (Yitzhaq Lamdan, "On the Altar"), much of the poetry up until the '60s viewed this motif in the context of the Shoah: the initial anger, as well as the residual trauma and guilt (Natan Alterman, "On the Child Abram"; Haim Gouri, "Inheritance"; Amir Gilboa, "Isaac"). The move from the collective to personal trauma is exemplified by Yehiel Mar's "Aqedah" and "The Fear of Isaac" by T. Carmi; similarly, a dehis- toricized, existential fear is reflected in Tuvya Riibner's "Voices" and David Avi- dan's "Curriculum Vitae." In many of these poems, the deconstruction of the psy- chological, moral, or ideological consequences of the biblical event is realized 173</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review through the manipulation of the roles or functions of the characters in the original drama-which is consequently deflated and ironized. In the most recent work discussed in this section, Yehudah Amichai's "The Real Hero of the Aqedah" from 1982, the poet takes this to the extreme, noting that it was the ram that was actually sacrificed; this brings the "true hero" to the fore- ground, endows it with human qualities, and portrays it as the innocent victim of the conspiracy engaged in by the other characters. Exploiting the metaphoric res- onances of the industry of memorial books produced for Israel's war dead, the poet levels a stinging, anti-heroic critique of Israeli militarism and the willingness of the society to offer up its young on the altar of the battlefield. As Kartun-Blum ex- plains, this continues an anti-martyrological reading that the late playwright Hanoch Levin had provocatively raised in his 1970 musical revue, The Queen of the Bath. In the Aqedah sketch from this play (which includes the poem, "Dear father, when you stand over my grave"), Levin mocked the sacrosanct "cult" of bereaved parents of fallen soldiers, touching a raw nerve in Israeli society and igniting pub- lic furor. The discussion of the Aqedah motif could have been enriched by includ- ing poets from the 1980s and 1990s (post-Lebanon War) whose focus has over- whelmingly been on the "internal" victimization of Israel's young soldiers. David Jacobson has dealt with the recent use of this motif in Israel poetry in his 1997 work, Does David Still Play Before You: Israeli Poetry and the Bible. The third and final chapter of the book is ambitiously titled "A Modern Mys- tical Experience: Intertextuality and Deconstruction in Israeli Women's Poetry," al- though Kartun-Blum restricts her discussion to a single poem by Yona Wallach, "The Troubles of Dona Teresa." Here she attempts to counter the prevalent per- ception that Wallach's poetry is self-contained or self-referential and does not en- gage canonical texts. Kartun-Blum argues that Wallach was a "strong" feminist writer who in fact daringly engaged these texts. In doing so, the poet served as a precursor for the revolution that has taken place in Israeli women's writing, a rev- olution whose impact can be gauged by the dramatic increase in the number and subtlety of allusions. Kartun-Blum invokes here the approach of Alicia Ostriker, who calls upon women writers to become "thieves of language": to appropriate the power of story-telling, to retell the myths from their own perspective in order to challenge the hegemony of patriarchal thought. In her reading of the Wallach poem, Kartun-Blum isolates three separate in- tertextual connections that the poet draws upon. She elucidates the direct allusion to the poem's eponymous subject, the sixteenth-century Spanish saint and mystic, Teresa of Avila, showing how Wallach valorizes Teresa as an autonomous-and autoerotic-figure. Kartun-Blum argues for a dialectic relationship across artistic media between Wallach's poem and one of Bernini's best-known sculptures, "The Ecstasy of St. Teresa" (itself based on a vision of God's angel described in Teresa's Life). The physicality and intense sensuality of the sculpted image of Teresa allows for Wallach's agonistic reading that reverses the power relationships of the male (an- gel) and female (saint). In the poem, it is the woman who possesses sexual control, wielding as she does the phosphorus-tipped dagger. Secondly, Kartun-Blum also shows how Wallach engages the "Woman of Valor" acrostic poem from Proverbs 174</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 31, "misreading" this paean to controlled female domesticity as an ode to armed power (',n). The final intertext Kartun-Blum connects with the poem is the myth of Amor and Psyche. Here, Kartun-Blum demonstrates how the poem's glowing, phosphorus-tipped knife (correlating with Psyche's attempt on Amor's life while holding a knife and a lamp) and the house of crystal and velvet in which Teresa erotically luxuriates (corresponding to the palace in which Psyche is "impris- oned") highlight "the uncompromising fight against patriarchal, chauvinist love" (p. 84). While the intertextual ties here are subtle and veiled, reflecting Wallach's more hermetic style, Kartun-Blum teases out enough evidence to support her fem- inist and post-structural decoding of this "difficult" poem. Although the two case studies that comprise the core of this study are fasci- nating and stand well on their own, there is little to make them cohere. In the pref- ace, Kartun-Blum states that she will be examining the use made by Hebrew po- ets of biblical allusion. While the author has demonstrated that Wallach does engage the Bible in her poem, it is done somewhat obliquely and is certainly not the primary intertext evoked. Perhaps a connection between them beyond the in- tertextual reading could have been established: for example, the motif of the knife, the sacrificial blade lodged in the heart of Isaac's descendants and the autoerotically charged knife held by the "ruptured" Dona Teresa; alternatively an analysis of women's writing on the Aqedah motif such as poems by Yehudit Kafri and Aliza Shenhar that, like the poem by Benjamin Galai which Kartun-Blum does treat, adopt the perspective of the biblically absent and silent Sarah; or perhaps the inversion of the roles of the dramatis personae in the evoked texts. At the very least, the chapter on Wallach's poem needs to be more directly integrated with the framework established in the introduction. But none of this takes away from the overall erudition and insightfulness of Kartun-Blum's exploration of the intertex- tual and linguistic echo chamber in which Hebrew writers operate. Kartun-Blum cites as an epigraph to the book the statement of the poet David Avidan: "The pur- pose of battle is dialogue." This aphorism could just as easily be turned around and read to reflect the subversive and contentious engagement of contemporary poets with the tradition-and the ensuing impact on our reading of both the alluding and source texts-that Kartun-Blum has illuminated in this small gem of a study.
