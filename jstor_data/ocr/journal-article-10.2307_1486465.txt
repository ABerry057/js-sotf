KATZ The essential argument of Lawrence Perlman's critique of my essay "Martin Buber's Epistemology: A Critical Appraisal"' is that I have misun- derstood Buber insofar as I claim that his dialogical philosophy is largely Kantian in structure. In response it must be said that Perlman has worked hard to make his case-but finally it is unconvincing, even seriously mis- leading, because it rests on a triple misunderstanding, i.e., a misunderstand- ing of Kant, of Buber, and of Katz. Let me be clear, to begin, that my essay dealt primarily, as Perlman rightly notes, with structural issues. Here I repeat, for the sake of simplicity, my earlier comment that Perlman quotes on the first page of his essay. Though Buber does not provide anything like the elaborate architectonic argu- ments of the first Critique it is evident that he assumes their essential validity. This implicit assumption, in fact, provides the a priori theoretical constellation of the dialogical structure.2 1. In my Post-Holocaust Dialogues: Critical Studies in Modern Jewish Thought (New York, 1983), pp. 1-51. 2. Ibid., pp. 8-9. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 STEVEN T. KATZ Perlman, in response to this schematic description, wishes to show that my construal is incorrect. And he proposes to show this by "bring[ing] evidence to the contrary," evidence that represents "a significant reversal or under- cutting of his [Buber's] reliance on some central Kantian positions." and Perlman goes on: It is my claim that Buber's understanding of the I-Thou relation undermines any possible reliance on Kant's metaphysics. Kant's noumena and Buber's Thou are not related as a foundation is to the rest of the edifice, as Katz sug- gests. In other words there is much more to Buber's Thou than a borrowed structural dependence based on Kant's noumena, and this additional aspect outweighs all structural dependencies. This counterattack, however, fails for at least the following reasons: 1. Perlman relies on Buber's claims to be an anti-Kantian, but these are in need of scrutiny-indeed this is the point of the entire exercise-and can- not be taken, as Perlman naively does, at face value. 2. Perlman's reading of Buber's comment in I and Thou reveals a pro- found ignorance of Kant's view and an uncritical reading of Buber's posi- tion.3 Only this incorrect reading of Kant and Buber allows Perlman to juxtapose Kant and Buber as he does. That is to say, Kant does not hold that there is only a "world of appearances" as Perlman suggests, based on his decoding of Buber. Rather, just like Buber, Kant knows there is a reali- ty-the world-that exists independently of sensation and consciousness. This is the noumenal reality. However, and again exactly like Buber, i.e., Buber's Kantianism, Kant argues that this noumenal reality is known to us, given the sorts of beings we are, in specific, usually, though not always (I will return to this point), phenomenal forms. That is, Kant is not a Berkeleyan idealist; at least he believes himself not to be and is critical of what he takes to be Berkeley's subjective idealism, which seems, in certain ways, solipsis- tic. Buber shares-borrows-Kants view exactly when he writes, as Perlman quotes him: "The world, to be sure, appears twofold to us in accordance with our twofold attitude." Buber, like Kant, posits the existence of an inde- pendent world but also, simultaneously, demands that our knowledge of this external world is dependent on our forms of knowing. There is no real anti- 3.

Note: Buber specifically uses the terms appear and attitude to describe the cause of the two alternative ways the world is known by us. Contra Perlman this does not, therefore, constitute a "[non] Kantian view of the world." Let me add for purposes of clarification and elucidation, as this seems to be at the root of Perlman's error, that for Kant there is also, to use Perlman's phrase, "no distinct world of appearances," as if such a "world of appearances" existed independently of the knowing self, or in Buber's language, outside of "our twofold attitude." 3. Perlman's assertion that "Katz's criticism that Buber, like Kant, denies reality to space-time is entirely baseless" is based on a completely false understanding of my exegesis of both Buber and Kant. What I argue, as anyone who knows his Kant will readily concur with, is that space-time as we know and employ it is, for both Kant and Buber, a product of con- sciousness, or using Buber's technical idiom, the consequence of I-It rela- tion. Perlman, for some reason that is not at all clear, rejects this as "entirely baseless." But contra Perlman, Buber explicitly tells us in I and Thou: Whoever says You [Thou] does not have something for his object. For wher- ever there is something there is another something; every It borders on other Its; It is only by virtue of bordering on others. But where You [Thou] is said this is no something, You [Thou] has no borders. Whoever says You [Thou] does not have something; he has nothing. But he stands in relation.4 This Buberian pericope requires no elaborate exegesis beyond noting the chain of thought involved. The I creates either It or Thou relationships. In one, I-It, the I simultaneously employs spatio-temporal forms of under- standing to order the relationship. In the other, I-Thou, relationship, the I does not so employ the spatio-temporal forms; indeed this is one of the defining requirements of I-Thou relationship. And it is in this Kantian sense that I read Buber as "denying reality to space-time." To reinforce this exe- gesis I cite another elaboration of Buber's on this theme. When I confront a human being as my You [Thou] and speak the basic word I-You [I-Thou] to him, he is no thing among things nor does he consist of 4. Ibid., p. 55. I have added the more usual term Thou in brackets for Kaufmann's term You.</page><page sequence="4">112 STEVEN T. KATZ things. He is no longer He or She, limited by other Hes or Shes, a dot in the world grid of space and time, nor a condition that can be experienced and described, a loose bundle of named qualities. Neighborless and seamless, he is You [Thou] and fills the firmament .... And even as prayer is not in time but time in prayer, the sacrifice not in space but space in sacrifice-and whoever reverses the relation annuls the reality-I do not find the human being to whom I say You [Thou] in any Sometime and Somewhere. I can place him there ... but immediately he becomes a He or a She, an It, and longer remains a You [Thou],5 Buber's understanding is thoroughly, perfectly, Kantian. Space-time, as we know and utilize it, is a product of our mode of relationship to things, vary- ing from I-It to I-Thou relationship; and in fact as we have seen, it is not applicable to I-Thou relations. Or to put it another way, Buber is no realist (in the technical philosophical sense) vis-a-vis space-time. Though avoiding any real presentation of Buber's position Perlman still feels free to assert: Whatever a detailed examination of twofoldedness would yield, it could not be mistaken for an ideal construction similar to Kant's noumenal/ phenomenal construction. Twofoldedness is a way of relating and not an act of judgment in consciousness as it is for Kant. But here again Perlman is taken in by appearances. For did not Buber, in the passage just quoted, instruct us that "I do not find the human being to whom I say You [Thou] in any Sometime and Somewhere," though he goes on to acknowledge, contra Perlman, that "I can place him there"? And how do I do this? By the attitude (Buber's own term) I adopt. Here I would call attention to the abiding nature of this Buberian idealist commitment, as evidenced in his little-studied but philosophically significant work "Dis- tance and Relation." Employing the Kantian notion of the "transcendental unity of apperception" in his own dialogical way-without mentioning Kant-Buber describes the act of "setting things at a distance" and "enter- ing into relation" with them in these terms: We may characterize the act and the work of entering into relation with the 5. Ibid., p. 59.</page><page sequence="5">A REPLY 113 world as such-and, therefore, not with parts of it, and not with the sum of its parts, but with it as the world-as synthesizing apperception, by which we establish that this pregnant use of the concept involves the function of unity: by synthesizing apperception I mean the apperception of a being as a whole and as a unity. Such a view is won, and won again and again, only by looking upon the world as a world. The conception of wholeness and unity is in its origin identical with the conception of the world to which man is turned. He who turns to the realm which he has removed from himself, and which has been completed and transformed into a world-he who turns to the world and looking upon it steps into relation with it, becomes aware of wholeness and unity in such a way that from then on he is able to grasp being as a wholeness and a unity.6 Buber could not be more revealing on the idealistic presuppositions, i.e., the role of human consciousness, in creating the world as we know it and as we enter into relationship with it. He tells us: It is only man who replaces this unsteady conglomeration, whose constitution is suited to the lifetime of the individual organism, by a unity which can be imagined or thought by him as existing for itself. With soaring power he reaches out beyond what is given him, flies beyond the horizon and the famil- iar stars, and grasps a totality. With him, with his human life, a world exists. The meeting of natural being with the living creature produces those more or less changing masses of usable sense data which constitute the animal's realm of life. But only from the meeting of natural being with man does the new and enduring arise, that which comprehends and infinitely transcends the realm.7 Again, in a second essay in the same collection, entitled "Man and His Image-Work," Buber writes: Man belongs in nature not merely with his vital acts, not merely as one who moves, but also as one who perceives. My perception is, without prejudice to all spiritually arising from my being a subject, a natural act in which "I" and x take part. Let us proceed confidently from x, from its unfathomable darkness: its being has intercourse with my being when it dispatches to my senses the repre- 6.

KATZ sentatives to which scientific language has lent the ambiguous name of stimuli, and out of our intercourse arise the clearly outlined forms that people my sense world in colour and sound. It itself, the sense world, arises out of the intercourse of being with being. Which connections correspond in the ontic of x to the forms of this our world? We know nothing about it. But when we gaze into the life-depths of our perception, we learn that here as everywhere forming is not a making. From each unrealizable connection in the x-world there shoots upward to us a multiplicity, just those so-called stimuli; it is as if it disintegrated into these stimuli in order to reach us. But here each multiplicity enters into a formed unity, my senses work together with it in close association-and the particular linden stands before me. Indeed, even the rustling and fragrance is not merely in and on it; it itself rustles and smells, and it is it itself that I feel when my hand touches its bark. From the wholly unsensible connection in x that meets me the wholly sensible correspondence has arisen that now stands in its place as a being in nature, with its existence dependent on me and those like me. Even when I wander in the desert and nowhere a form offers itself to my eye, even when a crude noise strikes my ear, there takes place in my perception binding and limiting, joining and rhythmizing, the becoming of a formed unity. The truer, the more existentially reliably it takes place, so much the more, in all realms of sense, is observation transformed into vision. Vision is figurating faithfulness to the unknown and does its work in co-operation with it. It is faithfulness not to the appearance, but to being-to the inaccessible with which we associate.8 Can anyone reading these Buberian propositions about dialogical relation- ship be skeptical regarding his profound indebtedness to Kant and the neo- Kantian tradition? Put another way, relationship for Buber is, in fact, a dispositional or attitudinal stance involving many attributes--nearly all of which are derived from his inherited Kantian schemata of phenomenal and noumenal reality. 4. Perlman's claim that his position is somehow proved by Buber's cri- tique of I-It, on behalf of I-Thou relation, is odd. Buber's criticism is no different than Kant's, it is certainly not un-Kantian. Kant argues that noumenal experience, which for him is gained primarily in our knowledge of ourselves as free beings (with all this means for the nature and possibility of ethics in Kant), is fundamentally different than phenomenal knowledge 8. Buber, "Man and His Image-Work," in Knowledge of Man, pp. 157-158.</page><page sequence="7">A REPLY 115 exactly because, to use Buber's idiom, quoted but misunderstood by Perl- man, "The unlimited sway of causality of [the] I-It world ... is not felt to be oppressive by the man not confined to the It-world but free to step out of it." Kant calls this stepping out noumenal experience and grounds his entire anthropology in just this possibility. Buber calls this stepping out I-Thou relation. But both Kant and Buber agree that there is a reality that men and woman can and do experience that is not limited to the world of causality/ I-It. That Perlman thinks this provides any grounds for his position is simply an error in his decipherment of Kant's view. I add that even Buber's language quoted by Perlman, i.e., Buber's phrase referring to "the capacity for decision. Whoever makes a decision is free," echoes, and emerges from, the Kantian emphasis on the autonomous will as the supreme evidence of the existence of noumenal reality and its presence in our lives. 5. Perlman's account of Kant's notion of the synthesizing powers of consciousness and Buber's supposedly different notion of relationship is thoroughly muddled. Its essential error is to confuse what Kant says about phenomena with what Buber says about I-Thou. That is, the proper analogy is Kant's noumenal and Buber's Thou. And here, contra Perlman, their observations concur rather than diverge. Kant, like Buber, sees the self working differently in the noumenal reality than it does in the phenomenal reality. This, by definition, is what constitutes the ontological disjuncture between the two realms. The quotation that Perlman reproduces from I- Thou says exactly this as any Kantian would. Or described from within the Kantian context, the reason that Kant distinguishes between pure and prac- tical reason is due to his firm premise that noumenal/ Thou awareness is to be radically distinguished from phenomenal/It knowledge. Let me also note that Perlman's claim that "What we know in [Buberian] relation is not a matter of how we know, as it is for Kant" is absurd. Is not the difference of It and Thou relationships wholly a matter of how we relate to the Other. This, indeed, is Buber's essential claim. The world is twofold in accordance with our twofold attitude. The attitude of man is twofold, in accordance with the twofold nature of the primary words which he speaks . . .Primary words do not describe something that might exist independently of them, but being spoken they bring about existence.9 9. I and Thou, trans. Gregor Smith (New York, 1958), p. 3 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="8">116 STEVEN T. KATZ And again, "the way he says I," Buber declaims, "what he means when he says I-decides where a man belongs and where he goes. The word 'I' is the true shibboleth of humanity" (I and Thou, Kaufmann trans., p. 115). Buber strikes this chord so repeatedly in I and Thou, and elsewhere, that it is diffi- cult to understand how it could be misconstrued. 6. Perlman is correct that Buber paradoxically, i.e., self-contradictorily, fills out the presentation of the Thou world far more than Kant does the noumenal world. But I had already made this point, as Perlman acknowl- edges, and this filling out is what Buber has in common with many post- Kantians from Schleiermacher on. But this is not a criticism of my argu- ment. Moreover Perlman misunderstands, as has now become habitual, what Kant's position is at this juncture. When Perlman connects Buber's comment about the man "reconciled to the It-world" with Kant, he is simp- ly engaging in shallow polemics. Kant's aim was exactly the reverse, i.e., like Buber his ambition was, as the title of his first and greatest work indicates, to Critique pure reason and to make room, as Kant himself said, "for faith." And this was no idle or defensive remark, as a reading of the second half of the first Critique, the whole of the second and third Critiques (of Practical Reason and Judgment), and his Religion within the Bounds of Reason makes self-evident. Here Perlman is right that Buber intends that "relation leaves categorical thinking behind." But he is wrong to think this individuates Buber's account from Kant's rather than showing its thorough dependence upon it. For Kant, what Perlman calls "the categorical conditions of the mind" also "lose their significance in the face of the noumenal" (Perlman writes here of Buber and uses the term "You" where I employ the apposite Kantian terminology). 7. Perlman's argument that turns on his understanding of what Kant means by a priori synthetic judgments is wholly irrelevant because (a) he simply does not understand what Kant means by this notion, and why he is interested in it; and (b) his effort to use Buber's comments about antinomies as a rejection of Kant's concerns is a non sequitur. Here I will produce no further extended counterargument, as Perlman's error is equivalent to adding 2 plus 2 and getting 5. 8. Perlman's claim that "God, or the Eternal Thou, is the being whose presence constantly disrupts and renders meaningless the Kantian form of knowledge and superstructure" is false. It rests, again, on failing to ade- quately distinguish what Kant himself has to say about the difference be- tween noumena and phenomena on the one hand and God on the other.</page><page sequence="9">A REPLY 117 When Perlman polemically asserts: "Clearly, meaning for Buber is not based on a logical judgment within a Kantian architectonic, but on an exis- tential decision 'to go forth to One's Thou,' " he is involved in seductive but misleading intellectual shadow-boxing. The correct way to understand Buber's thesis is not as an either/or over against Kant's Weltanschauung, but rather as an acceptance of that ontology, and then, within it, to opt for a particular existential act as defined and delimited by that larger inherited metaphysical matrix. 9. I will refrain from commenting in detail on the last third of Perlman's essay, in which he attempts to develop his own non-Kantian reading of Buber's epistemology, as it does not directly deal with my own work, which is the subject of this reply. However, I think my observations, reservations, and criticisms to this point indicate that anyone meditating on Perlman's reconstruction ought to do so with great care.
