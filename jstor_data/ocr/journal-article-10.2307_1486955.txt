<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert S. MacLennan. Early Christian Texts on Jews and Judaism. Brown Judaic Studies 194. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990. xxv, 203 pp. In this reexamination of the relationship between Judaism and Chris- tianity in late antiquity, MacLennan employs several of the tools sharpened in the critical circles of biblical scholarship. He goes beyond the historical- critical method, asks sociological questions, and probes the archaeological and epigraphic evidence. He seeks to interpret the adversus Judaeos litera- ture of the early church in this broad context, unlike earlier scholars, who confined themselves to the text. He selects four of the major texts for special consideration and devotes a chapter to each: Barnabas, Epistle of Barnabas (115-117 C.E.); Justin, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew (ca. 160 C.E.); Melito of Sardis, Pachal Homily (ca. 180 c.E.); and Tertullian, Answer to the Jews (ca. 197 C.E.). The study is a dissertation directed by Professor A. T. Kraabel at the University of Minnesota. An important methodological step stressed by MacLennan is the use of the evidence from the ancient city as "text." This is essential for reconstruct- ing the social and cultural elements that demonstrate the presence and the interaction of Jews, Christians, and others in a given place. Thus, the second-century history of Alexandrian antiquity is imperative for interpret- ing Barnabas; the evidence from Rome, Ephesus, and Neapolis in Samaria for a better understanding of Justin; that from Sardis for Melito; and that from Carthage for Tertullian (albeit, in the absence of decisive archaeologi- cal evidence from Carthage, Tertullian continues to be a primary source for the city's history). The author longs for the day when more archaeological evidence from the cities--even those nearly impossible to excavate-will further elucidate the controversial texts.</page><page sequence="2">302 BOOK REVIEWS After noting the uniqueness of each text, MacLennan cites the anti- Jewish themes recurring in this sort of literature, especially the notion of div- ine judgment for the rejection of Christ, the inadequacy of Judaism, and the supersession of the church. He interprets the charged sentiments in the ear- liest writings as stemming from the authors' attempt at Christian self- definition and reflecting their concern about the relationship between Chris- tians and Jews in their respective cities. He underscores the four authors' ignorance of the diversity within second-century Judaism, even the distinc- tive Judaism in their vicinity, and sees no real dialogue taking place between the two groups. MacLennan insists that this corpus is to be treated as theology rather than history since, among other reasons, it is historically unreliable. For example: how could Justin present the diverse Judaism and equally diverse Christianity of his day as monolithic entities? Theologically, however, these writings depend on the circumstances of the particular Christian communi- ties "as they dialogued among themselves" in their attempt at self-definition vis-a-vis Judaism. These documents emerged from the prevalent conditions in a given period and in particular places; therefore, the statements they con- tain on Jews and Judaism are not to be taken as timeless. Moreover, the polemical use made of these writings in subsequent centuries far exceeds the sentiments of the original writers, whose biblically inspired denunciations of Judaism need not be taken as anti-Jewish indulgences. Christian readers are here admonished not to cherish the contemptuous attitudes of these teachers in the early church. The author posits the following challenge in his conclud- ing lines: "Can Christians define themselves in relation to the Jews without supersessionistic or triumphalistic overtones?" The first respondent to MacLennan, however, is Rabbi Norman M. Cohen of Bet Shalom Congregation, Hopkins, Minnesota, who in a passion- ate foreword to the book reiterates more explicitly the author's not-so- implicit wish and goes on to congratulate him for paving the way that leads to this new attitude toward Jews and Judaism. Both the book and the fore- word appear to be intended for Christian readers primarily. MacLennan's intentions are praiseworthy, and his work is a step in the right direction. The university is to be congratulated for making the "non- confessional" reading of these religious texts possible and for attempting to make up for the chronic failure of the church. This volume constitutes a fine chapter in the ongoing Christian-Jewish dialogue, even though such a</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 303 dialogue is not always justifiable, seeing the fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity-regardless of a perceived common tradition. The thesis is meritorious, and the extent to which the anti-Judaistic polemic in these writings is informed or uninformed by second-century realities is suf- ficiently well made even without elaboration on how theology and context interrelate. The secondary arguments, however, are not always convincing, and the archaeological data could be interpreted differently. A critical read- er may at times benefit just as much from the rich notes as from the author's discussion. Contrary to the declared objectivity of the author, the book is not devoid of apology. The distinction between Jews and Judaism is over- stressed in trying to show that these writings were against the latter and not the former. Some further weakness is discernible in the author's repeated resorting to what might have been, when earlier he had given so much methodological preference to what was-as demonstrated through archaeological and epigraphic evidence. Where such evidence is not available, the argument is derived either from misinterpreted and subsequently generalized data from elsewhere or from the social sciences. For example, much is made of the rich archaeological evidence for a large and prosperous Jewish community in the Sardis of Melito's day and the absence of evidence for a Christian presence there in the corresponding period, leading the author to conclude that the sentiments against the Jews seem to have emanated from the relative poverty and mediocrity of the Christian group in that city. But where would one find any recognizable remains of church buildings from before the third century? The fact that Christians were not allowed to worship in public places also explains the scantiness of epitaphs and other inscriptions from the same period. Christian gatherings in private homes or house-churches were prevalent in the first two centuries of the common era, and this is borne out by both the literary evidence and the negative archaeological evidence for church buildings during this formative period. Synagogues, by contrast, had long been respected as public buildings and were widespread. By the end of the first century Christians had gradually distanced them- selves from all that was distinctively Jewish: dietary laws, circumcision, and the Sabbath. Rejection of even the Old Testament came about immediately thereafter with Marcion; however, if it were not for their anti-Marcionism as well, the Adversus Judaeos writers of this period might not have reclaimed the Old Testament as a Christian book on the assumption that Jews had</page><page sequence="4">304 BOOK REVIEWS misunderstood it. The gap between Judaism and Christianity was ever- widening, and Christians were the primary contributors to this develop- ment. Judaism at this time had very little to be coveted by apocalyptically driven Christians who were also afflicted with the martyr syndrome. While Christians were persecuted, Jews were officially tolerated. Yet Christians did not seek closer identity with Jews. The notion that early Christians were still struggling for self-definition in the latter part of the second century is diffi- cult to accept. Such struggle for identity seems to have subsided earlier, as various New Testament documents and certain noncanonical "apostolic" writings indicate. Equally unacceptable is the repeated dictum that theologi- cally motivated documents cannot be used for historical reconstruction (for a good example of the extent to which such reconstruction is possible, see J. L. Martyn's work on the Fourth Gospel). MacLennan's work illustrates how difficult-if not almost impossible-historical reconstruction can be when theologically motivated writings are not given priority in such an attempt. These writings still constitute the major blocks that we possess when considering the historical reconstruction of Christianity in the first two centuries; hence the appeal for caution regarding their use is preferable to that which calls for the rejection of their historicity. Still, one cannot help but be sympathetic to the author's concerns even when he contends that the writings of these early teachers were not intended to create the kind of hatred of Jews and Judaism that was derived from them by subsequent generations. He extends the same contention to the writings of the New Testament. These, however, must have inspired much of the po- lemic of the Adversus Judaeos texts. It would be ingenuous therefore not to trace the lingering tensions of the past to the New Testament, be it through an ill-informed Epistle, an imaginary Dialogue, a Homily motivated by envy, or an impertinent Answer to Jews who never bothered about Christian dogmatics-at least not in an entire theological treatise, as was customary among Christian writers-since they were preoccupied with the mundane and not with theology. Several scholars see these writings simply as an early link between the anti-Jewish polemic of the New Testament and that of later times. The author's disagreement is inexplicable--except, of course, apolo- getically. Not all of MacLennan's expectations spelled out at the end of the intro- duction seem to have been realized through this study. This is largely because of the author's apologetic concerns and somewhat jumbled meth- odology-in spite of the few sound approaches it encompasses.
