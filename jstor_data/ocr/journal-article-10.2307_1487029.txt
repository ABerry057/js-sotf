Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. 266 pp. The debates about Freud's "Jewishness" began as soon as the name Freud surfaced in the psychological literature of fin-de-siecle; scholarly interpretations of Freud's Jewishness began in the 1920s, ranging from the philo- to the anti-Semitic. The debate about the relationship between psychoanalysis as a system and Freud's Jewish identity began again in earnest in the 1950s with the publication of David Bakan's Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition. This book, which has had a long life, expounded on the basic view that being Jewish means being plugged into a religious (and, therefore, interpretative) community which is religious in its orientation and Hebrew in its mode of expression. Shortly after the found- ing of the State of Israel, such a definition of "being Jewish" made sense for acculturated Jews in the galut; it was the ultimate denial of their own identi- fication with Western, Christian models of culture and reading. Zionism (which was and remains an inherently secular movement resting on Enlight- enment arguments about the nature of the nation-state) was read as a "gathering in of the People," as an extension of religious identity. For Bakan, Freud's theories of, let us say, the interpretation of dreams could be paralleled to, and therefore (the operative word for all studies based on analogy) were the same as, the hermetic traditions of Jewish mysticism (beginning with the Kabbalah). It was, of course, trivial whether Freud (or any other secular Jew of the time) knew or cared much about this tradition. It was "in the blood." Now this approach is one which most recent scholarship (from Peter Gay to Ken Frieden) has simply abandoned. These critics, too, have crypto- religious definitions of what a Jew is or how a Jew thinks; that is, they return to the religious debates about the Jew in the late nineteenth century and place Freud against these debates. Freud is "a godless Jew," quoting Gay quoting Freud in a letter to the Lutheran pastor Oscar Pfister. These studies stress Freud's antireligious sentiments and see them as a reaction to a reli- gious definition of the Jew. Freud becomes the next in line of a series of Western thinkers which reads: Voltaire, David Friedrich Strauss, Nietzsche, Freud. ... During the past two decades this view has dominated all debates about Freud's Jewish identity. Freud's moderate (and late) pro-Zionist stance has been emphasized by thinkers such as Peter Loewenberg and has been used by other writers as a means of claiming Freud's "return" to the fold.</page><page sequence="2">128 BOOK REVIEWS Emanuel Rice has now returned, in a strange way, to the Bakan thesis (what goes around comes around). Here is the image of Freud as the crypto- religious Jew who has repressed his early religious training and allegiance to devote himself to the new religion of psychoanalysis and, at the very end of his life, makes "the long journey home." Freud as the crypto-Hebraist who knows more than he says he does; Freud as the son of a religiously trained and observant Jew who inscribes the family Bible to him with arcane and complex biblical and talmudic references. Freud as the Eastern Jew who comes to America and becomes a good Jewish doctor-sorry, that should read, comes to Vienna and becomes a good Jewish doctor. That is the prob- lem with this otherwise rather good restatement of the problem of Freud's Jewish identity. Rice really does not understand the stresses which accom- panied being Jewish in Central Europe from 1870 to 1938, a period of time without parallel in modern European anti-Semitism. Moving from Moravia to Vienna is not the same as moving from Poland to New York. While Rice quotes Marsha Rozenblit's sociological study of the Jews of Vienna, his sense of the differences between the Viennese and the American situation is vague. Since Rice does not understand the complexities of the world into which he has wandered, his antiquarian philological "reading" of Freud's father's inscription in the Philippson Bible rather misses the entire point. Why is the family Bible the Philippson Bible, and why does his father inscribe a dedica- tion using purely formulaic phrases which he could well have remembered from his earlier education? This conflict between traditional, Eastern rab- binic Judaism (which indeed had its parallels in Western Jewish tradition at the time) and the more acculturated Western forms of Judaism (whether Reformed or not is besides the point) was the problem of Freud's father-it was not Freud's problem. Freud's interest in religion was as a project in which he saw himself as not being involved-no more than he was involved in the totemic rites of the Australians which he also cited. For to Freud "being Jewish" had little or nothing to do with religion, it had to do with his image of himself as a scien- tist, not as a worshipper. His "Moseses" (yes, plural, for his reading of Michelangelo was equally important to the late "family romance") were objects of investigation as much as, if not more than, objects of identifica- tion. And this can be the starting point for a study like the one we are short- ly expecting from the pen of Yosef Yerushalmi. Rice's study is an interested lay contribution to the study of Freud-lay,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 129 in that it stems from the pen of a Jewish physician who has projected much of his own persona into Freud. This is certainly permitted, but the problems of a positive transference are ones well known to Rice and unexplored in his study. The missing chapter in this book, one which is hinted at in the intro- duction, is "why I undertook to show that Freud was a Jew like me." This is an exercise which one expects today from historians who deal with complex and interesting figures such as Freud, figures who speak directly to many of us at the turn of another century.
