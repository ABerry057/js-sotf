<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erich Gruen. Heritage and Hellenism: The Reinvention of Jewish Tradition. Hel- lenistic Culture and Society. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. xx, 335 pp. Erich S. Gruen, a leading Greco-Roman historian, here presents the results of several years of research in the field of Jewish history. Positioning himself as the gadfly in his adopted field, he describes certain consensus positions of schol- ars in Jewish studies and proceeds seriatim to question or deconstruct them. This makes for interesting reading, and in some cases a significant challenge to the stan- dard views of textbooks on the subject. Only some of his challenges can be men- tioned here. The first consensus he engages is the one that sees the Maccabean war as a revolt of the saints against the corrosive inroads of Greek culture and politics, fol- lowed, ironically, by the thorough Hellenization of the resultant Hasmonean regime (pp. 1-40). The embrace of Hellenistic kingship after the Maccabean Revolt is ac- cepted by scholars as a surprising but understandable assimilation to the in- eluctable force of Hellenism. Gruen denies this common interpretation of the Mac- cabean Revolt, arguing that the Maccabees were not opposed to Hellenism as such, 354</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews but to the oppressive policies of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in particular. He points out that the enemies named in 1 and 2 Maccabees are not Greeks but the sur- rounding nations, likened to the enemies of Israel of old, the Ammonites, Moabites, and so on. The ongoing diplomatic relations between the Maccabees and the Se- leucids would tend to confirm this. Some corroboration of his thesis can be found in the roughly contemporary but fictionalized work Judith, where the enemy is also, first, the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, but in addition the surrounding nations described as Ammonites, Moabites, Canaanites, and Edomites (Jdt 5:2-3, 7:8). However, the consensus view of the Maccabean Revolt as an inevitable con- flict between Judaism and Hellenism cannot so easily be replaced with the differ- ent but equally simple dichotomy of Israel versus the nations. 1 Maccabees does seem to identify the enemy as the peoples roundabout, but 2 Maccabees becomes an important test case for Gruen's thesis. While it is true that Seleucid figures can indeed be portrayed positively (3:3, 4:36, 8:20), they are often seen in direct op- position to Jewish piety (4:9-15, 11:24), and while the surrounding peoples are sometimes depicted negatively (8:9, 16), they can also be viewed in a positive way (4:35, 49; 12:29-31). To cloud the distinction further, ta ethnd, "the nations," sometimes seems to refer to the Greeks (6:4, 13:11); sometimes to non-Greeks (12:13, 14:14, 15:8-10); and sometimes to both (8:5, 9, 16), although it is in some cases unclear. A more workable conclusion can perhaps be derived from Robert Doran's study of 2 Maccabees as Temple propaganda (Temple Propaganda: The Purpose and Character of 2 Maccabees): how groups or individuals are viewed, and what ta ethnd means, is determined simply by their relation to the Temple and to Judaism. In other words, the valuations of Greeks and surrounding nations are not absolute, but always stand in relation to the Temple and Jewish interests. The cultural opposition of Judaism to Hellenism, or of Israel to the surrounding na- tions, may perhaps be better subsumed in 2 Maccabees under one umbrella. As another challenge, Gruen argues that in reading the more imaginative and fictitious Hellenistic Jewish texts, scholars often look for political references in all the wrong places, and have as a result missed the irony and humor in the texts (chaps. 5-7). With that, they also miss an affirmation of Jewish identity confident enough to include barbed satire of both pagan and Jewish figures. Third Mac- cabees, Apocryphal Esther, Tales of the Tobiads, and Letter ofAristeas all, in his view, reveal a subtle but unmistakable tweaking of pagan and/or Jewish sensibili- ties. He may be correct, but to read the ancient audience's sense of subtle irony is not easy, especially in such texts as Apocryphal Esther or Tales of the Tobiads. In the former I would see more romanticizing than satrizing (unlike the Masoretic ver- sion of Esther), and in the Tales of the Tobiads the supposed skewering of the Ptole- maic king may reflect instead a common ancient topos of how a clever person can ingratiate him or herself with a powerful king through aplomb (compare 2 Sam 12, 14; Herodotus 1.27, 3.34; Plutarch, Alexander 14.2; The Eloquent Peasant). In read- ing these chapters, I could not help but notice that Gruen consistently referred to sections of my own works where he perceived a disagreement, but not to places where I had investigated similar themes (note The Jewish Novel in the Ancient 355</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review World, pp. 44, 61-62, 68-69, 80-86, 130 n. 60, 132-157, 169, 190-191, and es- pecially 245 -256 on the Jewish satirical novel). To be sure, Gruen sometimes press- es for a satirical reading where I do not find it, but both of us seek out irony, satire, humor, and related issues in very similar ways in our works, though sometimes in relation to different texts. One wonders, for example, why Gruen barely mentions the humor and irony found in Judith, Tobit, and Testament ofAbraham, irony that in the latter two cases pokes fun at cherished Jewish values. A third scholarly consensus that Gruen critiques concerns Book 3 of the Sibylline Oracles (pp. 268-291). Many have identified a Jewish core composed in Egypt in the second century B.C.E., based on, among other things, references to the "seventh king." Gruen does not so much dispute this particular judgment as the notion that a historical context, or even a geographical location, can be dis- cerned. He raises interesting objections to various theories, but does not, to my mind, close the subject. True, Ptolemaic kings were not numbered sequentially to distinguish them as we do (pp. 276-277), but that would not preclude an inten- tionally obscure text from referring to the kings by number. True, identifying the "widow who rules the world" as Cleopatra runs into the problem that she was not known principally as a widow nor did she rule the world (pp. 279-280). Howev- er, she did rule because she was the widow of a Ptolemaic king, and she may very well have been symbolized in Egypt hyperbolically as ruling the world. Arising from Gruen's challenges is the consistent thesis that Judaism in the Greco-Roman period can be characterized as an exuberant engagement with Hel- lenistic culture and not as a conflict of worldviews. Gruen thus wants to avoid the usual stereotype of the pious struggle of Jews to maintain their identity under the onslaught of the dual threat of annihilation and assimilation. Despite the reserva- tions noted, the book will be a very welcome addition to the field of ancient Jew- ish studies. Simply by retracing the evidentiary basis for many of the accepted con- clusions of Jewish studies, Gruen forces a very salutary reconsideration of them. His challenges may not induce scholars to change their minds, but they will be forced to consider each and every one of them, and in several cases may find that their conclusions will have to be altered. Future treatments of these issues will like- ly have to run through Gruen's work and engage in what will be a very interesting dialogue.
