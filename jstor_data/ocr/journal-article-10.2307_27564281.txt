Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004. xiv, 440 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000438 Despite the proliferation of specialized monographs and the evident matu ration of the field of Jewish studies, one is still surprised to find significant lacunae in the scholarly literature available to the specialist and nonspecialist alike. Until recently, one such gap was a basic text dedicated to the history of the Haskalah, the eighteenth-century Jewish Enlightenment. To be sure, this ear liest chapter of the Haskalah, sometimes referred to as the German or Berlin Haskalah, has made an appearance in all histories of modem Jewry and modem Judaism, and there has been no end to the books focusing on the central individ uals, texts, and issues of this movement. But until the appearance of Shmuel Feiner 's Mahpekhat ha-Ne'orut?and now its English translation, The Jewish Enlightenment?there was simply no contemporary scholarly book that told the story of the beginnings of the Haskalah in broad, detailed, and thoughtful terms. In setting out to paint a thorough and complete picture of the Haskalah, Feiner offers us a first-rate narrative history, one that captures the movement not through abstract ideas or sweeping historical processes but through the events, reactions, and attitudes of those involved. In other words, Feiner insists on telling the story of the Jewish Enlightenment in its own terms, and his scholarly diligence and masterful command of the material bring the Haskalah to life as never before. He consistently relates the ideas of the Haskalah in terms of their social context, including questions of organization, audience, and the dissemina tion of publications. He returns time and again to the notion that perhaps the most 206</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews revolutionary and long-lasting impact of this eighteenth-century phenomenon was its very manifestation of a new intelligentsia, that is, a group that stood apart from and openly criticized the old rabbinic elite. Moreover, Feiner rejects the unfortu nate though common tendency to interpret the Haskalah in light of the larger processes of modem Jewish history, be it emancipation, religious reform, or assim ilation. Here, the Haskalah is presented as just one historically conditioned avenue to modernization rather than a phenomenon that was synonymous with modernization. The fact that Feiner chooses not to subsume his interpretation of the Haska lah within the broader issues that have come to define the modem Jewish experi ence does not, of course, mean he eschews an interpretative framework altogether. Indeed, throughout the book, he returns time and again to a set of related ideas and values that define this Enlightenment and, in his view, its tme legacy: the pursuit of extra-rabbinic knowledge in the form of European science and culture, the embrace of free and unfettered critical inquiry, and the promotion of tolerance as a prime social value. As such, the emergence of the mature Haskalah in the last two decades of the eighteenth century effected nothing less than a revolution ary transformation of Jewish society. In Feiner 's able hands, this story is told in all its complexity and messiness, but the picture that emerges is one that is colored in clear and somewhat surprisingly romantic tones, a Kulturkampf oi progress, opti mism, and Enlightenment versus rabbinic orthodoxy and obstinate resistance. The problem with this presentation of the Haskalah is that its narrative tension?its historical traction?is generated in Jewish terms. This tale is, in essence, one of intramural struggle between the maskilim and their rabbinic opponents over the right to shape the "Jewish public discourse" and its cultural agenda. In his concern for this Jewish battle over values and ideas, however, Feiner downplays and sometimes even ignores another set of confrontations, those between Enlightenment-minded Jews and Enlightenment-minded Chris tians. Feiner certainly points out that some members of the Pmssian Aufkl?rung ?among them Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, and August Cranz?took a rather dim view of traditional Judaism and challenged Jews to transform themselves into educated, productive, and moral individuals. But these Aufkl?rer and other Germans who participated in the contemporary debate over the Jews' civic status are largely portrayed as individuals who infused and reinforced the progressive values of the Enlightenment, not as writers who seriously undermined the meaning and future viability of traditional Judaism. As a result, Feiner 's narrative does not adequately account for the fact that some of the most active maskilim?Moses Mendelssohn, Naftali Hirz Wessely, Solomon Dubno, and Isaac Euchel?devoted considerable energy to fend off influential Aufkl?rer and the Christian attack on the most fundamental elements of traditional Judaism?its texts, its collective memory, and its halakhah. It is symptomatic and telling of Feiner 's narrative choices that the two richest and most substantive texts of the Haskalah, Mendelssohn's Bible project (Sefer Netivot ha-Shalom, commonly referred to as the Biur) and his Jerusalem, are given short shrift. There is no question that the maskilic translation and interpretation of the Pentateuch gave full expression to the new literary aesthetics 207</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews and cultural proclivities of the Enlightenment, but it was also a project bom of Jewish anxiety regarding the beginnings of European textual criticism and, more impor tantly, the enlightened European dismissal of rabbinic Judaism and its traditions of interpretation. Mendelssohn's Jerusalem, similarly, was certainly a book that planted Enlightenment universalism at the heart of Judaism and upheld religious tolerance as a central and inviolable principle. Although Feiner acknowledges that Jerusalem provided a statement of "unreserved attachment to the Jewish religion and its commandments" and the "absolute validity" of Jewish law, this does not do justice to Mendelssohn's brazen attempt to undercut Enlightenment historicism, affirm the value of oral traditions over the burgeoning book culture of the day, and lay the basis for a distinctly modem claim for the superiority of Judaism. In this scho lar's hands, Mendelssohn's relation to traditional Judaism comes across as lifeless and uninspired, and here we encounter the substantive cost of Feiner 's chosen narra tive?namely, insufficient attention to aspects of the Haskalah that sought new and creative means of defending tradition in a world that was at once seductively enticing and profoundly threatening. The Haskalah, in short, is portrayed as a heroic battle against the forces of the reactionary rabbinic establishment, whereas equal time should be devoted to a struggle?hardly less heroic?against the European Enlight enment itself. A more balanced and complete picture would have undoubtedly com plicated Feiner's narrative, but it would have produced a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of this important chapter of Jewish history. Even with this serious and fundamental caveat, Feiner's book is a welcome addition to the writing of modem Jewish history. Given the many accomplishments of this book, it is regrettable that the English edition contains far too many misspell ings and errors. Still, The Jewish Enlightenment not only fills an obvious lacuna in the scholarship on the beginnings of Jewish modernity, but also it will undoubtedly stimulate and frame much of the discussion for some time to come.
