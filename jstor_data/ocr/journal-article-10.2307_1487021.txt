<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jerold S. Auerbach. Rabbis and Lawyers: The Journey from Torah to Consti- tution. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. xix, 272 pp. In this book, Jerold Auerbach gives the reader a broad vision indeed. Narrowly conceived, Rabbis and Lawyers concerns the process of accultura- tion of American Jewry between the 1840s and the 1940s. However, it also attempts a much broader theme: the tension inherent in Jewish history between autonomy and acculturation. In other words, the book piggybacks 1. In this connection, it should be noted that the influence of Averroes' Epitome of the De Anima on parallel sections of the De'ot is greater than Jospe realized (see pp. 186-188; and as an example, p. 243, 11. 7-8, where the text under discussion does not simply express "views which are similar" to those of Averroes, but views that are in fact translated verbatim from Averroes' Epitome!). I have compared several passages from the De'ot, cited by Jospe in his notes, with Averroes' Epitome of the De Anima (Hyderabad, 1947, hereinafter cited as EDA) and have found the following passages to be full or partial translations from this epitome: p. 363, n. 10, from EDA, pp. 23-24; pp. 368-369, n. 1, from EDA, pp. 33-35 (first half of quota- tion; second half from Averroes' Middle Commentary on the De Anima); pp. 379-380, n. 6, from EDA, pp. 64-65; p. 383, n. 18, from EDA, pp. 72-73; pp. 385-387, n. 19, from EDA, pp. 80-85; p. 388, n. 21, from EDA, pp. 75-76; pp. 390-391, n. 7, from EDA, pp. 73-74 (with a sentence in the middle from the Middle Commentary); p. 399, n. 2, from p. 89 (first sentence only, rest of passage from Middle Commentary); and pp. 400-401, n. 5, from EDA, 87-88.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 105 an interpretive history of Judaism from ancient times to the present onto a more traditional monographic theme. The results are mixed. Auerbach's basic thesis is that American Jews are heirs to two legal tra- ditions-the Judaic and the American-which they have asserted, as a mat- ter of faith, to be compatible. Auerbach correctly demonstrates that the two traditions are not always compatible and in so doing raises the question of the ultimate cogency of the Jews' historical accommodation with America. In order to do all this, Auerbach engages in nothing less than a history of Judaism from its biblical beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval development. On the whole, this is done through an intelligent reliance upon secondary material, and the image that results is fairly clear and accurate. His parallel review of the American legal tradition, while somewhat smaller in scope, seems equally satisfactory. It is in the development of his major theme that the author puts himself on somewhat shakier ground. One of his major claims is that, between the 1840s and the 1940s, there existed two major groups with claims to give ideological direction to the American Jewish community-rabbis and lawyers. He attempts to demonstrate that of these two groups, it was the rabbis (primarily Reform) who first attempted to speak for the Jews of America, and that in the twentieth century, this task was increasingly taken over by lawyers. There are two flaws in this perception. While it is true that rabbinical figures like Isaac Mayer Wise attempted to articulate an ideologi- cal position appropriate to the condition of American Jewry, it is less clear whether any rabbi was the arbiter of American Judaism to the exclusion of lay leadership. In the nineteenth century, lay figures like Mordecai Noah were not less influential among American Jews than clerical figures like Isaac Leeser. The American tradition of lay control of rabbis, well estab- lished by the mid-nineteenth century when rabbis began settling in North America, means that we must be wary about taking the pronouncements of rabbis-who did think of themselves as the arbiters of an American Judaism-at their face value. Auerbach is essentially correct when he sees conflict between rabbi and layman in American Jewish history. He is on less solid ground when he talks of rabbis "losing" their authority to lead the Jewish community. This was an authority which they surely claimed, but which just as surely they never possessed and hence could not have lost. Similarly, the persistence of rabbinical figures like Judah Magnes, Stephen Wise, and Abba Hillel Silver in key leadership positions within the American Jewish community well into the twentieth century, when the lawyers were, according to his hypothesis, supposed to have taken over,</page><page sequence="3">106 BOOK REVIEWS indicates that it was not so much rabbis yielding leadership of American Jewry to lawyers around the turn of the century that is of essential interest to us. Of greater interest is how these two groups of American Jews influenced each other and collaborated with each other to create the sort of leadership which asserted, as a matter of faith, that American Jews faced no essential conflict between their Judaism and their Americanism. Auerbach's main point seems to be that the more "Jewish" a figure was, the less attractive he or she becomes in the American Jewish consensus which enshrined a Louis Brandeis and has forgotten a Louis Marshall. Another important point the book makes is the essential commonality of views on the relationship between Judaism and Americanism held by osten- sible opponents on the American Jewish political scene like Stephen Wise and Joseph Proskauer. In spreading before the reader his exceptionally broad canvas, Auerbach has committed some minor errors, perhaps resulting from an overhasty reading of some of his sources. Thus Isaac Mayer Wise did not, in his memoirs, characterize an individual New York congregation as an example of "Polish cabbalistical rabbinism and supernaturalism," as the author asserts (p. 77). That was Wise's characterization of Orthodox Judaism as a whole. Cyrus Adler did not grow up in the household of his cousin, Mayer Sulzberger (p. 99), but rather in that of his uncle, David Sulzberger. Nor was Adler ever considered primarily a "Judaic Scholar" (p. 192), either by him- self or by his colleagues. Julian Leon Magnes did not change his name to Judah Laban (p. 113). Abba Hillel Silver, despite his much publicized appearance at the 1944 Republican convention, was not really a "staunch Republican" (p. 193). He was, in fact, a strong supporter of Roosevelt up to the point where he sensed FDR's abandonment of the Jews. Rabbis and Lawyers ends its monographic task in the 1940s. However, true to its task of interpreting Jewish history from ancient times, it attempts to bring the story up to the present, criticizing those like Charles Silberman and Leonard Fine, who deny the crisis of conscience and identity that Auer- bach sees looming over American Jewry. The book does not even end with the present, but rather takes a gambit into the future. It concludes with a midrash on passages from Genesis and Hosea in which the author seems to indicate that Israel, having forgotten its maker and having built itself palaces, will be cast away by God, but that ultimately the children will "come trembling from the west to reclaim their</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 107 historic birthright" (p. 207). The key to Auerbach's parable seems reasona- bly clear. His final comment on his own midrash is "perhaps." Ultimately, perhaps, for all its valuable historical insights into the for- mation of one of the fundamental dogmas of American Jewry, this book works better as a midrash on American Jewish history than as an historical monograph.
