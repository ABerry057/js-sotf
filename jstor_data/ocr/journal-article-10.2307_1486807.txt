<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Kraemer. The Mind of the Talmud. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990. 217 pp. This is a work of careful scholarship. It brings together the fruitfulness of different scholars such as David Weiss Halivni and Jacob Neusner, raises seminal questions, and attempts an interpretation of its results within the history of ideas. David Kraemer assumes that the archaeology of the Babylonian Tal- mud, that is, the configuration of the material that has been bequeathed to us from the past in the form of the Bavli, can be translated into an overall "mind"-the accidents of historical preservation notwithstanding. He thinks, correctly in my opinion, that the energy expended on preservation is no less a barometer of mindset than the process of thinking and creation itself. If discussions of halakhah, of praxis, were preserved less than, or more than, halakhot themselves, this must say something about the value which those responsible for preservation-who were an integral part of the process of the development of the Talmud-placed on one or the other. Kraemer concludes that the coming into being of the stam, that is, the anonymous material that takes up a good part of the Bavli, gives expression to the development of an increasing fascination with discussion rather than with conclusion and halakhah for itself. In this stress on discussion, different opinions can be legitimate at one and the same time. "Process-human debate and deliberation-becomes a recognized value" (p. 48). "It is only then"-in the work of the "authors of the gemara itself"--"that the impact of human reason would be recognized for its full power" (p. 49). "... for the stam, there is only argumentation" (p. 79). This is interpreted to mean "the indeterminability of truth" (pp. 99 ff.).</page><page sequence="2">120 BOOK REVIEWS Kraemer claims to prove the "erosion of authority in the Bavli's sources" (pp. 127 ff.). (Whether or not there is such an erosion depends largely on definition: The question of how much newness the stam actually contributes to halakhah per se is a matter of much doubt for scholars like Abraham Weiss, M. S. Feldblum, and Avinoam Cohen.) Practice becomes separated from truth (pp. 139 ff.). "The Torah ... becomes largely dependent on the contribution of human reason . . . before it can mean anything at all" (p. 156). "Torah study becomes independent of its connection to practice or application" (p. 169). "In the Bavli, reason . . . often . . . seems to be identi- cal with what we would call common sense (p. 172). ". . . when the Bavli admitted the value of the contributions of both reason and revelation, both were compromised" (p. 187). For my part, I think that the thesis inherent in the research accomplished in this book should be reformulated. The talmudic thought system, inas- much as one may generalize, is grounded in a belief in the efficacy of teacher(s) and community. This is indeed antithetical to a notion of abstract truth; but it is not equatable with notions of pluralism or the "indetermin- ability of truth." The talmudic community considered itself to be "chosen" over other communities because, in all its humanity, it embodied the People of Israel who possess the Torah. That Torah might contain many incompre- hensible aspects, including the existence, side by side, of contradictions. Can one describe a belief in the validity of dialectic within a closed system of a "Chosen People" as an "indeterminability of truth"? Did the stam produce new halakhot? Were the talmudic rabbis open, say, to a truth coming from a Christian or Manichaean source? Actually, in the deliberations of the stam, the conglomeration of opin- ions from preceding generations is unconditionally accepted in its delinea- tion of halakhic scope and diversity. The seeming skepticism of the stam's authors toward the basis of much traditional material is really an expression of their confidence that, after all, their predecessors' authority is untouched in unending debate. Resolutions of contradictions in authority or logic and conclusions of "proof" are foregone conclusions and resolutions-in convic- tion, though not in specific content. Tradition, here, is never merely "cred- ible," "plausible," or "probable" (to use the terms employed by Perleman and Olbrechts-Tyteca in the passage quoted on p. 99); and its interpretation by the stam does not essentially change the halakhot per se. To doubt that tradition is really being continued would mean doubting the very possession of the Torah by the "chosen" community. To bring Torah and "common</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 121 sense," or reason, together may catapult us into a classic controversy; but I find the foregone confidence of the stamma'im vis-a-vis the givenness of tra- dition to be anything but "common sense." One may furthermore doubt whether a discussion that consistently lacks any real crisis of doubt or of threatening conclusion can be called reason at all, but that might be a hereti- cal criticism in too many circles. Perhaps one of the fallacies in Kraemer's formulations comes out most clearly in the phrase, "the Bavli is apparently predominantly a legal text" (p. 173, emphasis added). In legality we can think, perhaps, of a "truth" that lies behind the legal process, "truth," that is, as "how things are"-"as they actually are" (p. 174). But the Bavli, that is, the stam, is not predominantly a legal text! Rather, as Kraemer himself points out (pp. 165-169), it has to do with Torah lishma; the essence of the Bavli is discussion for its own sake-as the religious activity. The Bavli does not deny the existence of praxis or the ability to know "how things actually are" in the requirements of praxis. Rather, it raises the talking about Torah to a higher level than mere "how things are." There is, in a very specific sense, an otherworldliness to the Bav- li's fascination; "other" in the sense that it does not at all stare at life, but not in the sense of specifically and explicitly delineating an "other-world." The development that finds increasing expression toward the end of the talmudic period is, in my opinion, one of an increasing dissatisfaction with the tendency to perceive a congruency of Torah and halakhah (a tendency that was not successfully stifled by the stam's activity). Not that the author- ity of the halakhah was questioned; rather, the energy expended on hala- khah per se was. In Palestine this had happened already in an earlier period and in a different way, as is evidenced in the phenomenon of midrash- aggadah. The distancing from a preoccupation with halakhah, with praxis, entails a danger of temptation to meaninglessness, just as the separation of praxis from history and survival does; perhaps more active participation in the Palestinian creation of midrash-aggadah would have provided a more living religiosity, an opportunity to pursue meaningfulness rather than pilpul (discussion, that is, for discussion's sake), as an alternative to the hegemony of halakhah's demands on the religious person's preoccupations. Intellectual activity without meaning, an activity that draws so much energy as to become a veritable piety in some circles, will fascinate the mind of contemporary academia. Torah lishma ("Torah for its own sake") seems indeed to be able to open up into a secular religiousness. The maneuver into the confines of a preoccupation that might fit a voyeuristic academia, rather</page><page sequence="4">122 BOOK REVIEWS than the pain of failure in living-out, is, perhaps, a seed of passage into modernity after all.
