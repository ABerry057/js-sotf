New York: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 2001. xi, 468 pp. Lloyd Gartner has written an excellent survey for the serious student and a fine tour d'horizon for the professional historian, delineating long-range histori- cal developments concisely and lucidly, providing apt, fresh illustrations through- out the narrative, and efficiently unpacking terminology and nomenclature that would be obscure to the general reader. His book supersedes previous overviews of modem Jewish history. Opening with a chapter on "the heritage of medieval Judaism," Gartner then devotes considerable attention to the early modern period where he describes Mediterranean Jewry and the edot ha-mizrah with much greater attention than the older surveys. The treatment of Jewish life in the nineteenth century is inevitably more Eurocentric, revolving around the crisis years of 1815, 1848, and 1881- 1882. The structure of the twentieth century is determined by the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, along with the move to center stage of the American diaspora. Thus, the social devastation and political chaos inflicted by World War I led to a relentless spread and amplification of anti-Semitism. Gartner lays out the main features of the Holocaust and events leading to the creation of the State of Israel in a dignified, understated tone that drives home all the more their momentous consequences. The concluding part describes the postwar recon- struction of Jewish life from the late forties to 1980, when the narrative ends. As befitting Gartner's earlier work in social and local history, special atten- tion is placed on migration (symbolized by the famous photograph on the cover by Robert Capa of displaced persons finally on their way to the land of Israel). Social and economic trends are necessarily treated by region of the world; changing political fortunes are often covered country by country. Gartner's approach is heav- ily influenced by his teacher, Salo Baron, whose importance to him is acknowl- edged in the introduction. Like Baron, Gartner places special emphasis on Jewish demographic patterns and the varied structure of the Jewish communities. Reli- gious movements and denominations are handled judiciously. Almost always there is that balanced judgment associated with Baron: a rather acidulous statement is qualified by an "on the other hand." Attention is paid to influential Orthodox fig- ures that have not been given their due in general Jewish histories as well as to Re- form Judaism, even though Gartner's sympathies lie with the Conservative middle ground. As with Baron, one will not find any startling conceptual breakthroughs in Jewish intellectual history or the history of Jewish literature. From time to time, Gartner remarks on Jewish philosophy and high culture, but the deeper theologi- cal (or secularist) dilemmas of choosing to be Jewish in the modern world are not his primary concern. Gartner's strength is his impeccable mastery of significant detail drawing on wide-ranging, up-to-date reading. The reader is provided an account which does effectively convey the continual series of transformations usually called "modern- ization" without Gartner's discerning-or imposing-an overarching or underly- 199</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ing theory. Hence, at the end Gartner remarks: "Schemes, even as learned as Krochmal's was for its time, may not hold up against simple observation, not to mention detailed historical investigation." Although early on he sets himself apart from the "Jerusalem School" of recent Israeli historiography, in the hesitant sen- tences of his concluding paragraph he seems to see the achievements of the state of Israel as the main hope of the Jewish future. Perhaps it is this reluctance to ex- trapolate trends that caused him to end the book in 1980, avoiding the more prob- lematic Jewish concerns of the recent two decades. The book has no separate bibliography, but there are plenteous references to recent historical studies in the footnotes. A drawback for some is the small type used in the paperback edition. We must be very grateful for a book written with such care, accuracy, sen- sitivity, and reasonableness. One would hope that the publisher would make more of an effort to bring this magisterial volume to the attention of non-Jewish readers as well, who, unfortunately, have much to learn from it.
