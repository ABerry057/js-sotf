<plain_text><page sequence="1">John H. Dippel, Bound Upon a Wheel of Fire: Why So Many German Jews Made the Tragic Decision to Remain in Nazi Germany. New York: Basic Books, 1996. 353 pp. The main problem with this often gripping and well-written book is that it promises more than it delivers, and delivers something rather different from what it promises. Dippel tells the story of six distinguished German Jews and their anguished decisions to leave or not to leave Germany in the thirties. He profiles an elite group and their struggle to come to terms with the collapse of the so-called German-Jewish symbiosis, which they had found so productive throughout their lives. In the end, they could not survive in Germany despite their preeminence and their influence. The individuals Dippel chose to profile hardly constitute "ordinary" German Jews. Well connected and well known, they had a visibility that imperiled them even as their contacts offered them some protection. Dippel portrays prominent financier Max Warburg, whose banking skills and financial wizardry made him one of the most powerful bankers, Jewish or non-Jewish, in Germany, and Leo Baeck, scholar and rabbi, who became the leader of the Reichsvertretung and thus the de facto leader of the Jews in Germany during their most trying hours. Zionist journalist Robert Weltsch, whose oft-quoted column after the April 1, 1933 boycott, "Wear It With</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 287 Pride," brought him a measure of fame and respect, is depicted along with Nobel Prize-winning scientist Richard Wilstatter, who lived in regal isolation and believed in the meritocracy of science well on into the Nazi regime. The plight of Hans Joachim Schoeps, a fiery young German nationalist and right-wing Jewish leader who became a philosopher and thinker under duress, is described, as well as that of Bella Fromm, a journalist and gossip columnist with excellent contacts to the diplomatic corps and the Berlin elite. Each of the six is as atypical of Germany's Jews as any elite and unrepresentative of the general populace. All of them had contacts at home and abroad that provided invitations to emigrate and illusions of safety that delayed their seemingly inevitable departures--options that their coreligionists did not have. Alone among the six, Rabbi Leo Baeck stayed with his people until he was deported to Theresienstadt in 1943. His decision to stay was not an act of folly, but of principle. He believed that a rabbi must stay with his flock. While Baeck was not the only rabbi to make so honorable and self-sacrificing a decision, many others, including some renowned Orthodox and Hasidic leaders, left their followers behind without guidance, and often without a word. Warburg and Weltsch well understood the tenuousness of their positions, yet their respective talents in finance and journalism afforded them the opportunity to be of service to other Jews, to help their people and become central, until the eleventh hour, in efforts to rescue the Jews of Germany. They were brave enough to stay until it was almost too late and wise enough to depart just in time. In the interim, Warburg dedicated his considerable talent to working on Jewish welfare concerns and finding common economic ground between the desire of Jews to emigrate with some of their financial resources intact and the desire of Germans to enrich themselves by confiscating Jewish wealth. He kept himself useful and productive until he could no longer assure his own safety and then sought refuge in the United States. Weltsch used his journalistic skills to interpret events to Jews in Germany, advocate emigration to Palestine, and console, assist, inform, and shape Jewish opinion. Although he had been on the margins of Jewish life in Weimar Germany, events pushed him toward the center as Zionism suddenly became viable and Palestine the destination of German-Jewish youth. Both men were never again to enjoy the prominence of their final days in Germany, never to be as influential or as needed. Dippel allows us to understand the courage and wisdom of those German Jews who left Germany early, who uprooted themselves and moved to</page><page sequence="3">288 BOOK REVIEWS freedom. Still, he does not portray their stories as vividly, and we have less of a sense of their personal situation. Others have portrayed Baeck as convincingly. Leonard Baker's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography gives a larger context to the rabbi's work and inner struggle. It traces his entire life and the decisions he made regarding Jewish participation in deportation and his role as a religious leader in Theresienstadt. So too, Albert Friedlander, whose wide-ranging consideration of Baeck as a sage and spiritual figure has a depth that is not found in this work. Dippel's task is deliberately more limited. He is interested in a more narrow question. To leave or not to leave, and when to leave, those were the questions. I found his portrayal of Bella Fromm intriguing precisely because I knew so little about her world and about the "in crowd" of Berlin in the 1930s. She traversed the world of glamour and power; she chronicled Germany's social crowd. She was protected by lovers and admirers. Throughout, she attempted to use her social contacts to protect herself and her daughter as well as those to whom she could be helpful. After her departure for the United States, she too found that life could not be the same. Much to his chagrin, Richard Wilstitter found that science could not be pursued independently of society. The laboratory was his place of refuge, but his world became more constrained and limited until his departure. International recognition was his protection. It afforded him the opportunity to leave and the illusion that he could stay until it was almost too late. Schoeps was a more tragic figure. He adjusted far too late to the reality that Nazi Germany had no need for Jewish supporters, and that right-wing Jewish nationalists were of even less interest to the Hitler regime than Zionists, whose passion for Palestine made them more willing to depart. Still a young man, he could not find his place either in Germany or outside it in the 1930s and thus could neither stay nor find refuge. He remained dependent on the support of his parents. It was not sufficient to be a Jew of talent and considerable brilliance during those desperate times. My quarrel with the promise implied in the title is that I would like to know why so many German Jews delayed their departure. After reading Bound Upon the Wheel ofFire, I knew why five privileged Jews delayed their departure and one remained. For Warburg and Weltsch the decision to delay was not so much tragic as sacrificial. They offered their talents to their people in the hour of most desperate need. They left in time. To a lesser degree the same can be said of Fromm. For Baeck, choosing personal safety would have compromised his integrity, his rabbinate. His fate was tragic but poignant.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 289 So much is learned from Dippel. The portraits are gripping, the anguish so clear that this reader is grateful. Still, the disappointment is that the larger, most compelling of all questions remains unanswered. One might have expected otherwise.
