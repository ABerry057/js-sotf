Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000, 288 pp. Writing a survey history is not easy. Every basic decision-periodization, geographic limits, thematic focus-is fraught with the linked dangers of overgen- eralization and oversimplification. There are always experts looking over the au- thor's shoulder, ready to cry foul if their areas or contributions are not accorded sufficient attention. And if the author is a good historian, she will realize how much she has had to omit, how tendentious she has had to be. Anna Foa is a good histo- rian, and she is therefore especially to be congratulated for having taken on the ar- duous task of producing this highly readable survey, now in its third, updated Italian edition and at last available in an unfortunately flawed English translation. The book was clearly prepared with Italian university students and lay read- ers in mind; despite its pan-European title, the book is primarily structured around the Italian Jewish experience. Foa begins her account with the Black Death even though it meant omitting the main features of Ashkenazic and Sephardic medieval growth and cultural accomplishment. The brief "Afterword on Modern Times" notwithstanding, Foa ends her book with the complex story of European Jewries' emancipation in the nineteenth century, omitting any serious treatment of the Shoah or Zionism. But such idiosyncratic periodization makes perfect sense when we realize that Foa has focused her book on those centuries in which the role of Italian Jews is especially significant and well known. She has, furthermore, struc- tured her book along the usual lines of Italian history which begins the Renais- sance in the fourteenth century and ends l'etd moderna in the nineteenth. Foa's book is of a sort more common in Europe than in America: a survey of the state of the field that tries to maintain a narrative line while acknowledging the positions and contributions of various historians. The end result is, in a sense, clos- er to a team effort than a scholarly monograph. The role of the author is subtle and complex: she is coach, editor, and commentator as she molds the historiographi- cal approaches into a readable story without overwhelming the individual contri- butions of her sources. The best of these books make wonderful teaching tools: the details of history are given meaningful context and students come away with a sense of how scholars collaborate to construct a picture of an era. (Incidentally, this may explain why most textbooks for Jewish history don't work in the classroom: they lack that sense of historiographical debate and process.) To appreciate how Foa has approached her task, let my try to outline one of her chapters. In Chapter 6, Foa organizes her discussion of the sixteenth and sev- enteenth centuries under the title "The Age of the Ghettos." She gives useful ter- minological, legal, and historical overviews of the ghetto especially in Italy, evaluates its demographic impact, and assesses the factors that led to Jewish pop- ulation growth and oppressive overcrowding. She also opens up many of the the- matic issues involved in the study of the period by structuring her presentation around what she calls the "paradoxicality" of the ghetto-a form of simultaneous confinement and protection for the Jews. Though it is, in her view, an expression of Christian conversionary ideology, the ghetto is also the home of a Jewish soci- ety with its own long-standing norms and values. Although ghettoization helped 334</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews to strengthen certain inward-turning tendencies in Jewish culture, it also led to in- creased borrowings from the outside society. Indeed, even the rise of kabbalisti- cally inspired confraternities and nighttime religious ceremonies are shown to be linked to behavioral and cultural patterns found in the outside world. In other words, Foa has produced a social-cultural history of the sort that is widely read and taught today, and has exposed her readers to a strong sampling of current approaches to the field. She has made the subject accessible even to read- ers and students without detailed knowledge of terms, genres, ideologies, geogra- phies, or other specifics. But she has also challenged the reader to delve deeper, by pointing out broader issues and providing bibliographical references to the work of each scholar whose views she has summarized. (Although I find the APA style of in-text citation-author and date in parentheses-unappealing on aesthetic grounds, it has become the norm in European publications and it does work well here.) What could have been a useful work, however, is sadly marred by uneven translation and sloppy editing. Andrea Grover mistakenly assumes that Italian words that sound like English also mean the same thing as their English parallels. She is repeatedly trapped into imitating the convoluted structures of Italian acad- emic prose, producing English that simply doesn't mean anything. And on more than one occasion, she misses Foa's point and therefore misrepresents the original even though she is being faithful to the literal meaning of each individual word. Equally distressing is the sloppy editing of the bibliographical references. In the brief chapter summarized above, this reviewer found eight mistakes: references to the wrong, or to nonexistent, items in the bibliography, incorrect page numbers, and so forth. (There were similar mistakes in the Italian original; some of these have been corrected, but others seem newly invented for English readers.) The ef- fect of poor quality-control is compounded by the unfortunate decision to omit one of the most useful parts of the original work: a 40-page discussion of the state of the field and guide to further reading. Many scholars and no fewer than ten charitable foundations and donors worked with the University of California Press to make this English translation possible. It would be wonderful if this collaboration between philanthropists and an academic press could serve as a model for future publication of an entire series of textbooks aimed more specifically at the American reader.
