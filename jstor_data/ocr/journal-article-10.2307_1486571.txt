DAVIS I During the Middle Ages, each Mediterranean land, from one end of the sea to the other, had its Jewish philosophers. There was one region and one Jewish culture, however, that made no contribution at all to the writing of medieval Jewish philosophy. That was Ashkenazic or Northern European Judaism, the culture of the Jews of England, Northern France, Germany, and Eastern Europe north of the Balkans.' The culture of medieval Sefardic or Mediterranean Jews and that of medieval Ashkenazic Jews differed in many things: in their modes of literary expression and in their customs, in matters as large as attitudes toward Christianity and messianism, and as small as styles of handwriting. One particularly far-reaching difference was the commanding position of Jewish This article is a condensation of the first chapter of my Ph.D. dissertation, "R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller, Joseph b. Isaac ha-Levi, and Rationalism in Ashkenazic Jewish Culture, 1550-1650" (Harvard University, 1990). An earlier version was given as a talk at the AJS Annual Conference in Boston, 1990. I must thank the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, which generously supported my research in 1987-1989. 1. After 1550, there was a certain amount of philosophical writing among Ashkenazic Jews; see Davis, "R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller," pp. 121-127. Before that there was none at all; but cf. n. 12 below.

DAVIS philosophy in medieval Spanish and Mediterranean Jewish culture and its near-total absence from medieval Ashkenazic culture. And yet these two cultures, these two subcultures of medieval Judaism, were not far apart geographically. It is not so far, as the crow flies, from Narbonne to Troyes, or from Verona to Regensburg. Throughout the Middle Ages, there was ongoing contact between French and German Jews and Spanish and Italian Jews, a long history of mutual cultural influences and cultural borrowing. The history of this interrelationship has yet to be written, but some chapters are well known: for example, the influence of the Spanish Jewish grammarians on Rashi and his program of Bible exegesis.2 An aspect of this cultural interrelationship that is at once less known and more controversial is the influence (or lack of influence) of the medieval Jewish rationalism of Mediterranean lands on Ashkenazic Judaism in the late Middle Ages, particularly during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. This has been the subject of two major studies, which have come, however, to opposed conclusions. In 1972, Ephraim Kupfer, in an article called "Li-Demutah ha-tarbutit shel Yahadut Ashkenaz ve-hakhameha ba-me'ah ha-14-15" ("Toward a Cultural Portrait of Ashkenazic Jewry and Its Sages in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries"),3 argued, against the current of previous scholarly opinion, that the influence of medieval Jewish rationalism on late medieval Ashkenazic culture was deep, pervasive, and historically important. However, very recently, Israel J. Yuval, in his study of the German rabbinate between 1350 and 1500, has argued to the contrary that the influence of philosophy in this period was peripheral and superficial.4 The matter has not been settled, nor do I intend to settle it here. A final weighing would require a full survey of the surviving printed and especially manuscript documents of the period; this I have not done. 2. Cf.

When the history of Ashkenazic theology comes to be written, the late Middle Ages, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, will be significant as the period in which the guiding hermeneutic of Ashkenazic theology ceased to be the principle of loyalty to the literal sense, the peshat, of talmudic aggadah, and dogmas such as divine incorporeality and ex nihilo creation came to the fore. This perspective on the question will be supported by a close reading of a work written by an Ashkenazic Jew of the period, Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, by Simeon ben Samuel.5 The nineteenth-century portrait of Ashkenazic Jewry after the Black Death and the massacres of 1349, the portrait drawn by Heinrich Graetz and others, depicts deep cultural decline and ignorance. Graetz states sharply: "The insignificance of even the most respected of the German rabbis of this period is apparent from the fact that not one of them has left any important Talmudical work; that, on the contrary, they all pursued a course productive of mental stagnation."6 German Jews, Graetz claims, felt a "fanatical hatred against profane knowledge."7 Graetz admits only a single medieval exception, R. Yom Tov Lipman Muelhausen (fl. 1400), a rabbi in Prague and author of Sefer Nisahon, a work of anti-Christian polemic, whom he calls "the foremost and perhaps the only really learned German Jew of the Middle Ages."8 In his history of rabbinic literature, Dor dor ve-dorshav (written in 1891), Isaac Hirsch Weiss is almost as caustic as Graetz. Although he does not dismiss so radically all of the intellectual attainments of late medieval 5. The work was published in Freiburg in 1560, again in Lublin in 1599, and a number of times since then. I have looked at MS. Oxford-Bodleian 1589/5 as well as the fifteenth-century manuscript, JTS MS. microf. no. 2351. There are other manuscripts as well that I have not seen, such as Moscow-Guenzberg 482/2. The manuscript versions include a passage at the end not in the printed text. My references are to the Bartfeld (Hungary) 1911 edition. 6.

DAVIS German Jewry, he adds mordantly that its achievements were limited to the realm of law and custom, not theology and certainly not philosophy. He writes concerning R. Jacob Moellin (d. 1427), called Maharil: In all the writings that carry his name, there is not the slightest evidence of any concern for theology; nor did he know anything of philosophy; and in his discussions short and long of every custom, however trivial, he did not find the slightest room to write on the principles of our religion or the basic principles of morality. There can be no doubt that since the days of the struggles of the zealots against the philosophers [i.e., the Maimonidean Controversies of 1232 and 1306], Ashkenazic Jews had treated all of philosophic thought as an unclean thing.9 Once again, Muelhausen, who did study philosophy, is taken to be the solitary exception. "He was like the rose among the thorns. For among the sages of Ashkenaz, who in that generation knew anything of these matters? Who of all of them sought to learn any subject apart from the Torah?"' It was these widely accepted generalizations that Kupfer disputed in his 1972 article. Citing a body of new evidence from unpublished manuscripts, Kupfer argued that Muelhausen was far from the only Ashkenazic rabbi of his day who studied works of medieval Jewish philosophy. Both of Muelhausen's colleagues on the Prague rabbinic court, R. Avigdor Kara and R. Menahem Shalem, Kupfer showed, were also students of philosophy. Shalem wrote on philosophical topics and was familiar with the writings of al-Ghazzali, Narboni, and Gersonides, among others. Kupfer also published the text of a correspondence on theological-philosophical topics between Menahem Shalem and R. Abraham Klausner, the rabbi of Vienna." Furthermore, Kupfer showed that a Jewish philosopher, Solomon b. Judah of Provence, had lived in Prague about 1360-1370.12 Solomon b. Judah gave 9. Dor dor ve-dorshav (Berlin, 1924), 5:247-248. Graetz and Weiss, it should be noted, did not invent this view. In 1559, R. Joseph Ashkenazi claimed that the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century "Hasidim of Austria" used to deface and burn books of philosophy. See Monatsschrift fAr Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentunts 47 (1903): 346. It is not clear whether this tradition is reliable. Cf. n. 55 below. 10. Dor dor ve-dorshav, 5:270. 11.

Also, two generations after Muelhausen and Shalem, in 1468, R. Juda Obornik, a student of R. Israel Isserlein (d. 1460), held a high regard for the philosophers, as he wrote in a letter that year. Obornik was familiar with some of Menahem Shalem's teachings, and conducted a correspondence on theological-philosophical topics with a certain R. Isaac, who had also read some writings of Shalem's.13 And finally, between 1465 and 1490, various philosophical works, both Jewish and Islamic, and including works by Shalem himself, were copied in various cities in Poland by the scribe Yeruham Fishel b. Solomon.14 On the basis of these and a couple of other small pieces of evidence," Kupfer made essentially three claims. The first is that there was a continuous late medieval Ashkenazic tradition of the study of Jewish philosophy, from Solomon b. Judah in 1360 and through R. Moses Isserles, about 1550.16 Kupfer's second claim is that the study of philosophy had a significant impact on the views of these rabbis. He argues particularly that they were aware of themselves as "rationalists," ba'alei sekhel. Kupfer emphasizes the opposition of Shalem and Obornik to kabbalah, and takes this as evidence of a rationalistic self-awareness. And finally Kupfer claims that philosophy was studied by a "considerable group" of Ashkenazic rabbis in this period. The chance survival of the material that he cites should be taken, he claims, as an indication of much wider study of philosophy which left no written record.17 Kupfer stopped short of claiming that Muelhausen and Juda Obornik were typical of the Ashkenazic rabbinate of their day. Not so Haim Hillel 13. Kupfer, "Li-Demutah," pp. 125-134. 14. Ibid., pp. 130-131. 15. Kupfer briefly mentions two other pieces of evidence in "Li-Demutah," and one more in a later article. In "Li-Demutah," he mentions two manuscripts: one of the Guide, copied in Prague in 1396, and one of the philosophic textbook Ruah hen, with notes by R. Seligman Bing (fl. 1450). In a later article ("Hasagot min hakham ehad 'al divrei he-hakham R. Yosef ha-Lo'azi she-katav ve-qara be-qol gadol neged ha-Rambam," Qoves cal yad 21 [1985]: 221-222), he published an oath taken in 1467 by R. Moses Zart of Lichtenfels, in which R. Moses states his acceptance of all the doctrines taught in the Guide, with certain exceptions. Cf. n. 87 below. 16. See Kupfer, "Li-Demutah," p. 131. This conclusion was endorsed by Lawrence Kaplan in "Rationalism and Rabbinic Culture in Sixteenth Century Eastern Europe: R. Mordecai Jaffe's Levush Pinat Yikrat" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1975). The evidence for the period 1470-1530 is extremely weak, however. 17. See Kupfer, "Li-Demutah," p. 132.</page><page sequence="6">200 JOSEPH M. DAVIS Ben-Sasson. In his magisterial essay on medieval Jewish history in the History of the Jewish People, which he edited, Ben-Sasson takes Muelhausen as the typical example of a late medieval Ashkenazic scholar. Ben-Sasson cites two passages, both from Sefer Nisahon, that demand the study of science and philosophy. He writes: Despite the general view to the contrary [viz., the view of Graetz and Weiss], the scholars and leading personalities of Ashkenazic Jewry in [the late Middle Ages] were well acquainted with secular works and regarded with favor elements of culture and attitudes that are usually thought to be characteristic only of Spanish Jewry.'8 Although neither Kupfer's article nor Ben-Sasson's discussion budged the popular stereotype of the medieval Ashkenazic rabbi, they were given a very cordial reception: by scholars. Indeed, Kupfer's article became the foundation upon which a number of later studies have built."9 Very recently, however, Israel J. Yuval has argued in detail that the claims made by Kupfer and Ben-Sasson are very much overstated.20 Muelhausen and the other philosophically inclined rabbis discussed by Kupfer, Yuval argues, were anything but typical of the Ashkenazic rabbinate of their day. To the contrary, they were a very small, rather distinct circle of men, mostly in the community of Prague. All of them, Yuval writes, lived on the periphery of Ashkenazic Jewish culture. "From Germany in the fifteenth 18. History of the Jewish People (Cambridge, Mass., 1976), p. 624. Cf. David Tamar's remark: "It is a mistake to suppose that the scholars of [Isserlein's] generation and the one that preceded it were limited to the 'four cubits of the law"'; and Tamar gives a list of twelve rabbis whom he believes to have not been so limited. See Sinai 32 (1952): 175. The list is based on Judah Kaufman, R. Yom Tov Lipman Muelhausen (New York, 1927), pp. 2-12. 19.

Abraham Klausner."21 Although there is some overstatement here, the point is well taken.22 Kupfer cites six independent documents and manuscripts, and yet they all point toward a single school. Perhaps that school, that small circle, was the only one of its kind. Both Solomon b. Judah and R. Menahem Shalem were Jewish philosophers who had immigrated to Prague from Mediterranean lands.23 It may well be that their like was found nowhere else among Ashkenazic Jewry. Yuval then turns to the question of the degree of interest in philosophy that is attested by the documents Kupfer cites. Yuval focuses on Klausner, the only German rabbi in the group, as we have said. Klausner himself, Yuval points out, states in his letter to Shalem that he would like to be instructed "concerning the principle of the unity of God, .... for it is very difficult for me to ... study and read those books [i.e., books of philosophy]." The emphasis is Yuval's. Klausner, Yuval writes, "was a simple man of halakhah [ish halakhah muvhaq], who had no understanding of philosophy." He concludes: Evidence such as this does not point to interest in philosophy but to its absence. ... We must conclude that Prague was exceptional.... Philosophy had almost no impact in Germany, neither in terms of its weight within the intellectual world of the Ashkenazic rabbinate, nor in terms of the numbers of those who studied it.24 A few pages further on, Yuval seems to relent a bit. R. Menahem Zioni (d. ca. 1410), the author of a kabbalistic Torah commentary called Sefer Zioni, 21. Yuval, Hakhamim be-doranm, p. 301. 22. Yuval ignores R. Seligman Bing here; he will come back to him later on, in connection with his grandfather, R. Menahem Zioni. More significantly, he ignores R. Juda Obornik, who was a rabbi in Muenster in Westphalia. See Kupfer, "Li-Demutah," p. 127 n. 84: see the responsa of R. Moses Minz, nos. 97 and 100. 23. Kupfer inclined to the view that Shalem was an Ashkenazic Jew by birth and early education. He explains the name that Shalem is sometimes given, "Menahem Aglar," as deriving from the Italian city of Aquileia, but suggests (p. 124) that Shalem came to this city during "his wanderings" from Ashkenazic lands. Reuben Bonfil ("Sefer 'Alilot Devarim: pereq be-toldot he-hagut ha-Yehudit ba-me'ah ha-arba' 'esreh," Eshel Be'er Sheva' 2 [1980]: 237 n. 38) suggests that Aglar derives from Aguilar di Campo in Spain. Moshe Idel, in conversation, has said that he has strong evidence that Shalem came from Jerusalem (the name "Shalem" might indicate this). Evidence of an Ashkenazic background seems weak. 24. Yuval, Hakhanmimn be-doramn, p. 301.</page><page sequence="8">202 JOSEPH M. DAVIS who lived in the city of Cologne in the Rhineland, had a "limited interest in philosophy," Yuval writes. (Zioni is not mentioned by Kupfer.) It is true that Zioni's sympathies are more with Nahmanides than with Maimonides, but he does quote from Maimonides' Guide, as Yuval notices, not always disapprovingly."2 Yuval even admits more broadly the existence of "a group of scholars in the Rhine valley [in the fifteenth century] who involved themselves with kabbalah, magic, and, to a lesser extent, philosophy."26 But as Yuval points out, this group too (which included Zioni, Zioni's grandson R. Seligman Bing, and others) was geographically and numerically limited, and he states once more: "The center of culture that arose in Prague ... is the only one in which the intensive study of philosophy or kabbalah can be detected. No generalization should be made from [Prague] to German Jewry."27 III In January 1400, King Richard II of England died in his cousin Henry's dungeon, perhaps of starvation. In August, the German emperor, Wenceslas IV, was deposed. It was a bad year for kings. Pope Benedict XIII, abandoned by his cardinals, was besieged in his fortress in Avignon (ironically, 1400 was a "jubilee year" of the church). The church was divided by schism; Bohemia would shortly be shaken by the Hussite heresies. Sefer Hadrat Qodesh was written in the midst of these ominous events.28 According to the colophon of one of the manuscripts, the work was completed 25. See ibid., pp. 287-290. Cf. the discussion of Zioni in Davis, "R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller," pp. 90-95. 26. Yuval, Hakhamimn be-dorant, p. 305. 27. Ibid., p. 308. 28. The miraculous events of the year 1400 are described in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh (pp. 43b-44b): "This year ... four miracles were done to us. For it was written according to the laws of the Christians that the Jews were to be killed every fifty years. .... And thousands came and placed the sign of the cross on white garments, and formed a host, and wished to kill the Jews, and bands of Penitents formed a host, and they too thought to kill the Jews; and [so did] the reviled king [Wenceslas?] who had threatened us for many years. But the Lord saved us from them." On the events of the period and their impact on the Jews, see recently Israel Yuval, "Yehudim, Husitim, ve-Germanim 'al pi ha-keroniqah 'Gilgul Benei Hushim," Zion 54 (1989): 275-320; Zevi Baras, "'Al Behalat Yehudei Ashkenaz bi-yemei masa' ha-selav neged ha-Husitim (1421)," Zion 55 (1990): 246-248.</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY, DOGMA, AND EXEGESIS IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZIC JUDAISM 203 on the new moon of Nisan (Friday, March 26) in the year 1400 in the city of Regensburg in southern Germany.29 Yuval discusses Sefer Hadrat Qodesh briefly.30 He discusses the author's apocalyptic messianism, and his elitism; he notices the author's leaning toward kabbalah and the teachings of the Hasidei Ashkenaz.31 A second reading of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, however, will show that the author was influenced not only by kabbalah, but by Jewish philosophy, and particularly by Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. We will see that these rationalist influences were neither marginal nor superficial, but substantive and far-reaching. Our reading of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, furthermore, will offer important signposts to the historical impact of Jewish philosophy on late medieval Ashkenazic culture. Sefer Hadrat Qodesh has three parts. The first part is a restatement of Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith. The second part is a prayer or meditation, written in rhymed prose. (The prayer covers some standard medieval themes: the contrast of God's greatness and man's insignificance; the depiction of death and the rotting corpse; resurrection, expressions of penitence, and messianic hopes.) The third part of the book is a commentary to parts 1 and 2; that is, a commentary to the Thirteen Principles and to the prayer.32 All three parts were written by the same author, Simeon ben Samuel. Nothing is known about him apart from his authorship of this work. 29. See MS. Oxford-Bodleian 1589/5. The colophon reads: "Completed in Regensburg on the new moon of Nisan, 160 [=1400], and part of the commentary was completed twenty-six years afterwards." The date 1400 is also given in the text, on p. 44a of the printed edition. The work is quoted in the mid-fifteenth century by R. Seligman Bing; see Yuval, Hakhanmini be-doranm, p. 296. In my thesis, I suggested that Hadrat Qodesh was written in the year 1349. This was an error. 30. Yuval, Hakhanzinz be-dorant, pp. 295-300. I have found no other secondary literature on the work. 31. If Gerson Cohen is correct in his characterization of messianic attitudes among medieval Ashkenazic Jews ("Messianic Postures of Ashkenazim and Sefardim," Studies of the Leo Baeck Institute [New York, 1967]), then the imminent messianism of Simeon ben Samuel, Menahem Zioni, and the others noted by Yuval (Hakhanmim be-doranz, pp. 291-300) is (another) indication of the influence of Spanish Jewish culture. Note also the prediction of the scribe Isaac of Nuremberg, quoted by Judah Kaufman in Muelhausen, p. 180. Cf. Ruth Gladstein, "Eschatological Trends in Bohemian Jewry during the Hussite Period," in Prophecy and Millenarianisnz: Essays in Honour of Marjorie Reeves, ed. Ann Williams (London, 1980), pp. 239-256. 32. The use of the forms of rhymed prose and self-commenting text may also be seen as instances of the influence of Mediterranean culture. Other examples of self-commenting texts</page><page sequence="10">204 JOSEPH M. DAVIS The restatement of the Thirteen Principles in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh makes certain additions to the Maimonidean text. For example, the author identifies each of the Thirteen Principles with one of the Thirteen Attributes of Divine Mercy, and certain of the principles with certain of the Ten Commandments; he ends each principle with a rhymed-prose couplet.33 The principles in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, furthermore, tend to be theologi- cally more precise than those in Maimonides' text.34 The principle of divine providence, for example, which is expressed in the Maimonidean text in quite general terms, is stated rather narrowly in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh; there it is the belief that God exercises providence over individual persons, while over animal and inanimate life He exerts only general providence "for the preservation of the species.""35 A second example of the greater precision of the dogmas of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh is the doctrine of creation. Maimonides refrains from mentioning creation (hidush) as one of the principles. The fourth Maimonidean principle is that God is qadmon be-hehlet ("absolutely first"), but creation per se is not mentioned.36 Not so in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh. There the author states as part of the fourth principle that "God created the world yesh me-ayin [ex nihilo]."37 In the commentary, Simeon b. Samuel elaborates on the principles, and suggests a more sophisticated understanding of many of them. For example, he explains how the principle of divine unity (the second principle) does not rule out divine attributes of action. He quotes Maimonides' parable for the from the same period are the anonymous Sefer 'Alilot Devarim and Vidal Benveniste's Sefer Efer ve-Dinah. 33. N.B. also his gematriyot on the number thirteen: pp. 33b, 34a. 34. Cf. Muelhausen's dogmas, which are also theologically more precise than Maimonides'. See Frank Talmage, "Mavo," in his edition of Muelhausen's Sefer Nisahon (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 21-22, where Talmage discusses the various manuscript and printed versions of Muelhausen's dogmas, and esp. p. 22 n. 80, where he compares Maimonides' text to Muelhausen's. 35. Hadrat Qodesh, p. 34a. See Guide 3.17. 36. See the discussion in Menahem Marc Kellner, Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought (Oxford, 1986), pp. 53-55. Maimonides revised the text of the Thirteen Principles later in life, but the text of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh is based on the unrevised list of dogmas. Kellner incidentally claims (p. 196) that Yom Tov Lipman Muelhausen "was the only Ashkenazic Jew known to have commented on the principles of Judaism." Clearly, this is not correct. 37. Hadrat Qodesh, p. 30b.</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY, DOGMA, AND EXEGESIS IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZIC JUDAISM 205 divine attributes, the parable of the sun, and he adds two additional parables not from Maimonides. And a parable for it is that the heat of the sun bleaches and darkens, melts and hardens: it bleaches garments, but darkens the launderer; it melts wax, but hardens clay. How much more so, how very much more so, can the Creator of the sun be in truth one thing and its reverse. In just the same way, you might say that a man who dies may impoverish someone, but enriches the heir of his property. Behold, in one and the same matter there is the blow and the remedy. And so does the wind put out a wood fire that is burning, but ignites the wood fire or the torch that is not lit.38 What has the author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh read? Besides the Bible, Talmud, and midrash, he has read a number of kabbalistic works, as many as eight or nine. (We will come back to the question of his use of kabbalah.) He has also read Maimonides' commentary to Pereq Heleq, where the Thirteen Principles are listed.39 Moreover, he quotes pieces of philosophical allegorical interpretations from a work whose author he calls only "the great sage" (and whom I have not been able to identify).40 And he has read the Guide of the Perplexed.41 Simeon b. Samuel has not merely assimilated the trappings of medieval rationalism, simple notions such as the four elements, the five senses, and the seven gradations of life.42 These, we might suppose, were the common property of medieval men, even German Jews, at least by the fifteenth century. But Simeon has also assimilated certain crucial Maimonidean doctrines; for example, the equation of the angels with the Separate Intellects, and of the "dead" with the ignorant and the "living" with the wise.43 Simeon's philosophical readings were not as extensive as his readings of kabbalistic texts, but they were surely intensive. Intense study was not a monopoly of scholars in Prague. 38. Ibid., p. 38a. Cf. p. 29b. See Guide 1.53. 39. See ibid., pp. 29b, 35b. Cf. pp. 33a, 39b. 40. Ibid., pp. 31a, 31b, 35a, 40a. 41.

DAVIS Sefer Hadrat Qodesh gives a picture of the world, a cosmology, that is drawn from many sources, including kabbalah, the Talmud, and the traditions of the Hasidei Ashkenaz. (The author makes reference, for example, to the process of creation of a golem.)44 But overall, the cosmology of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh draws from no source more than from medieval philosophy. In the realm of astronomy, for example, Sefer Hadrat Qodesh does not rely on the talmudic description of the "seven heavens." Rather, the author's astronomy is Ptolemaic and Aristotelian. The world, Simeon b. Samuel writes, is threefold. It comprises this lowest world of transient earthly bodies, the world of the spheres, and the world of the Intellects.45 The earth is in the center of ten concentric spheres; the spheres are moved by their respective Separate Intellects.46 Simeon b. Samuel knows also that "the astronomers have proven" that the sphere of the fixed stars revolves in a cycle of 36,000 years. He argues that since "God does nothing in vain," the existence of this great cycle supports Maimonides' belief that the Messianic age will be extremely long, and will last many thousands of years.47 He believes as well in a Neoplatonic system of connections of the three cosmic realms to the three or four different parts of human nature He writes: You know that man has a vegetative soul, an animal soul, a rational soul, and a divine intellect. The vegetative soul receives the influence of the stars that rule over the plants. ... The animal soul receives the influence of the soul of the spheres. The rational soul and the Divine Intellect are influenced by the Separate Intellects.48 Along with Ptolemaic cosmology and a Neoplatonic view of human nature, Simeon ben Samuel has also imbibed the philosophers' axiology, their system of values. In one place, he copies Maimonides' discussion of the four perfections of man. In another passage, he writes in a Neoplatonic 44. Ibid., p. 28b. 45. Ibid., p. 37b; cf. Guide 2.11. 46.

The passage is based on Guide 2.10; the author moves Maimonides' Neoplatonism in a kabbalistic direction.

The "divine image" of man is "the soul ... which is ready and destined to study divine matters."50 Intentionally or not, he moves the Aristotelian scale of values in the direction of asceticism and kabbalah, but the distance of his views and his aspirations from a narrowly talmudic or pietistic axiology is clear. The author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh has absorbed philosophical doctrines more than philosophical methodology. He does not rehearse any philosophical proofs in the work itself. (He does once refer hurriedly to Maimonides' argument for creation.)"5 But in one place, Simeon ben Samuel offers a proof of his own, on the question of whether the body feels pain after death. It is not a deductive proof, and it argues, against the view of the scientists, for the view that the dead body does feel pain. Both the content and the form of the proof show the distance of the author from the mainstream of Jewish Aristotelian thought. But the very attempt to offer a scientific grounding to religious belief is significant. He first brings a scriptural proof-text: a verse in Job (as interpreted by Rashi, among others) suggests that the body does indeed feel pain. But the scriptural proof does not decide the question. "There are some of the scientists who are astonished that [this verse] can be correct according to the realities of nature. But we will answer them with four correct proofs.""5 The "four correct proofs" are these: that two twins "of pure nature" will both feel pain when either of them is hurt; that an apparently stillborn child will grow warm and come alive if the afterbirth is thrown into boiling water, "if he is lively"; that there is a certain vineyard where the wine that was pressed the previous year will ferment and become turbid at the same time that the workers are digging and pulling up the weeds among the vines; and that if a glowing coal is put to human excrement "as it is still warm as it leaves the body," the 49.

DAVIS person from whose body it comes will himself feel the pain. The excrement is separated from the body, the wine from the vineyard, the afterbirth from the child, and the twins from each other, but there is a connection of sensation that continues to join them; so the human soul, Simeon b. Samuel argues, remains joined to the body for some time after death and may experience sensation and pain. Notice the form of the argument. The scriptural proof-text is supported by a "true proof," a scientific, albeit naive, argument from empirical evidence.53 The author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh was not well trained as a philosopher or a scientist; he may have been an autodidact. But he was not a "simple man of halakhah." IV Let us return to the general question of Kupfer's claims and the character of late medieval Ashkenazic culture. First, on the typicality of study of philosophy. The question of typicality is largely a question of numbers, and like Kupfer and like Yuval, I am not in a position to answer it. Just as Muelhausen and the others discussed by Kupfer may not be typical, or Zioni and the Rhineland group set out by Yuval, so also the author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh may not have been a typical rabbi. Indeed, he may not have been a rabbi at all, as that title was understood in the fifteenth century, and he is far from regarding himself as typical; he believes that he belongs to a small intellectual elite.54 But it is clear that the Ashkenazic study of Jewish philosophy was not strictly limited to the figures listed by Kupfer and Yuval." For example, an 53. Compare Zioni's comment on Gen. 1:2 (Sefer Zioni, p. 5c: "there is no part ... of the earth and no place which does not have its correspondence above ... and the proof of this is that one who draws a picture of a thief on a wall . .. and hits it ... will cause the thief to feel pain." Cf. also p. 55a on Lev. 20:6: "Some of the wise [ha-niaskilinz] ask how the dead can speak ... but this mystery was confirmed [immet oto] by the master of secrets [i.e., R. Eleazar of Worms] from the story of two witches." (And he tells the story at length.) 54. See the references to the "small remnant" (yehidim ha-seridinm), pp. 33b, 34a, 41a, and elsewhere. Yuval discusses the author's rather extreme elitism, pp. 298-299. 55. Cf. the studies listed above in n. 20. In my dissertation, pp. 76-110, I discussed a number of texts, some discussed also by Yuval and some not, which show some contact with philosophy. Note particularly Shalom b.

Judaism in Northern France in the fourteenth century may have been different from that in Germany, but note also that in a responsum (published by J. Goldblum from MS.

DAVIS But I have found no evidence that Maimonides' Guide was read by any Ashkenazic Jew for more than a century after the ban on the Guide during the first Maimonidean Controversy in 1232.58 If, then, the Guide was being read at all by German Ashkenazic Jews at the turn of the fifteenth century, that in itself marks a considerable change.59 If copies, manuscripts, of the Guide and of other works of Jewish philosophy were circulating in Germany, beyond Prague, and if it was considered permissible to read and quote from them, then we can hardly say, as Weiss does, that in the fifteenth century, subjects such as science and philosophy were "considered an unclean thing." The rise of philosophic study among Ashkenazic Jews, it is to be noted, occurred at the same time as the rise of universities in German and Eastern Europe. The two may be related.6 The leading position of the University of Prague in the religious life of Bohemia during this period is well known; might it not have helped to bring about the study of philosophy among Prague Jews as well?61 Regensburg did not have a university in the Middle Ages, but in the latter part of the fourteenth century, its monastery of St. Emmeram was home to Conrad of Megenburg, a scientist and philosopher, and author of the first scientific works in the German language, the Buch der Natur and the 58. Although I have searched as carefully as possible, it is of course possible that there are references to the Guide that escaped my attention. Cf. Israel Jacob Dienstag, "Yahasam shel Ba'alei ha-Tosafot leha-Rambam," Sefer ha-yovel li-khvod Shmu'el Qalnian Mirski (New York, 1958), pp. 350-379. Samuel b. Abraham Saporta's response to the French rabbis does quote objections to passages from the Guide. Cecil Roth claims that David of Oxford "probably" owned a copy of the Guide in the late thirteenth century: Roth, "R. Elijah of London," Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England 15 (1946): 56. However, I do not find Roth's proposed identification very convincing. The references to the "Moreh" in Sefer Moshav Zeqenim, a fourteenth-century collection of comments on the Torah (ed. Solomon David Sasoon [London, 1959], pp. 24, 29, 492), are to Rashi rather than to Maimonides' Guide, although the Mishneh Torah is quoted (p. 516), as well as Nahmanides. 59. Was Simeon b. Samuel identical to the "Simeon" for whom the Guide was copied in 1396 by R. Isaac b. Joseph of Warsaw, a scribe in Prague? See Kupfer, "Li-Demutah," p. 147. 60. Ta-Shema notices the synchronicity in "Yedi'ot hadashot cal Tosafot Gornish ve- 'inyano," 'Alei sefer 2 (1976): 89.

The University of Prague was the first university in the German Empire (not counting the imperial parts of Italy); it was founded in 1348. See Reginald Robert Betts, "The University of Prague: 1348" and "The Influence of Realist Philosophy on Jan Hus and His Predecessors in Bohemia," in his Essays in Czech History (London, 1969), pp. 1-12, 42-62.</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHY, DOGMA, AND EXEGESIS IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZIC JUDAISM 211 Deutschen Sphaera. The cathedral in Regensburg is hardly 1,000 feet from the Jewish quarter. Can we not imagine that a man like Simeon ben Samuel was aware of the existence of scientific and philosophical learning among the Christian clergy? We may well suppose that, if not out of admiration then out of competition, this awareness inspired him in his own study of the Guide.62 In the end, both Graetz and Ben-Sasson and to a regrettable degree both Kupfer and Yuval are victims of the same simple fallacy. That is the belief that there was a single "typical" sort of Ashkenazic rabbi in the late Middle Ages. Each historian tries to delineate a single normative range of intellectual pursuits. But perhaps there was no such single type or range. There may have been, to the contrary, a variety of possible interests and types. One field of study-the one that captured the interest of Simeon ben Samuel in Regensburg-was philosophy-kabbalah, the linked pair of Jewish metaphysical doctrines and esoteric interpretations of Scripture. If we search for typicality, we are forced to make ever more subtle exclusionary arguments to explain why men such as Muelhausen, Zioni, Jacob b. Samson of Horva, and Simeon ben Samuel were not "typical." Muelhausen was not typical, it may be said, because he was in Prague; Zioni because he was a doctor, or because he studied in the land of Israel; Jacob b. Samson and Simeon ben Samuel for some other reasons. Such arguments may be invented ad infinitum. But if we let go of the search for typicality, and search instead for variety, we will find it. V We come now, finally, to the question of the cultural significance of the study of Jewish philosophy among Ashkenazic Jews. It is on this question that Sefer Hadrat Qodesh has the most to teach us, and I think that this is in 62. See Guido Hable, Geschichte Regensburgs: eine Ubersicht nach Sachgebieten (Re- gensburg, 1970), p. 136, on intellectual life in medieval Regensburg. Several of the ranking clerics of the period had university training, and St. Emmeram had one of the major libraries of the Middle Ages. Christian-Jewish polemics as a context for the study of philosophy is discussed by Shank and Talmage (see above, n. 19). Interestingly, at the end of the author's addition to Sefer Hadrat Qodesh in MS. Oxford-Bodleian 1589/5, he remarks again on his goal of esotericism, and then quotes (from the Gospels) the "saying of the sages of the rebels [morin], 'do not throw pearls before swine."'</page><page sequence="18">212 JOSEPH M. DAVIS fact the crucial question: not so much the issue of exactly how many persons read exactly how many books, but what these books meant to them if they did read them.63 Here is an Ashkenazic Jew in the year 1400, reading the Guide of the Perplexed. How did it influence him? What did he think he had in front of him? I would like first to go back to the thirteenth century and look at an earlier chapter in the interaction of Ashkenazic and Sefardic cultures: the participation of Ashkenazic rabbis in the Maimonidean Controversies of 1216-1232. In the various Ashkenazic attacks on philosophy from that period, there is one quite consistent line of opposition: the principle of literal interpreta- tion, and especially the literal interpretation of talmudic aggadah.64 Aggadic literalism was the bedrock on which thirteenth-century Ashkenazic rabbis built their opposition to philosophy. Or, if you prefer, it was the touchstone by which they tested philosophy and found it to be unacceptable. Philosophy was identified by them, sometimes explicitly, with allegorical interpretation, and allegory in turn was associated with Christianity.65 63.

Marc Saperstein, in his study of allegorical interpretation of aggadah, Decoding the Rabbis: A Thirteenth Century Commentary on the Aggadah (Cambridge, Mass., 1980), p. 7, claims that Taku was "anachronistic ... and isolated" in his literalist stance. I think that this is only true</page><page sequence="19">PHILOSOPHY, DOGMA, AND EXEGESIS IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZIC JUDAISM 213 Ashkenazic Jewry in the thirteenth century knew nothing of dogma or dogmatic principles. Take as an example Maimonides' third principle, the contentious question of God's incorporeality, the belief that God is not a body of any type. To suppose that the Ashkenazic rabbis, even R. Moses Taku, the author of Ketav Tamim and the most vocal opponent of philosophy, held a corporealist view of God's nature is to credit him and them with a doctrinal or dogmatic approach to theology that they did not in fact take. Taku holds fast to the talmudic aggadot understood literally: both those that suggest divine corporeality, and there are many, and those that suggest divine incorporeality or absolute transcendence, and there are some of these as well. Good Tosafist that he was, he tries to reconcile the conflicting texts. 66But his problem, I repeat, was not so much a dogmatic one as a hermeneutical one: how to understand apparently contradictory passages together, without doing violence to their literal sense, their peshat.67 As against this, for the author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, divine incorpore- ality is a firm dogma. He accepts the Jewish philosophers' equation of divine from a Spanish or Mediterranean perspective. Joseph Dan, by contrast, in the introduction to his edition of Ketav Tamim (Jerusalem, 1984), p. 9, calls Taku "unexceptional"-i.e., unexceptional within Ashkenazic culture, in which opposition to allegory ran strong throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 66. Taku musters textual support for divine corporeality in Ketav Tamim on pp. 59-62. On pp. 69-70, he quotes texts that support the belief in absolute divine transcendence. On p. 61, he offers a compromise: a parable of the magician, who can change his form at will. 67. Note Taku's defense of talmudic cosmology: Ketav Tamim, pp. 68, 75, 84. Note also his insistence on the reality of the Divine "Throne": p. 85. Although certain of Taku's positions are clearly not based only on textual grounds-e.g., his objection (p. 69) to the belief that God is present even in filth, or his rejection (p. 63) of belief in a semi-divine intermediary-the preponderance of his views are grounded simply in a literal understanding of the Bible, the Talmud, and the prayers. My discussion here agrees with the thrust of Bernard Septimus's argument in Hispano-Jewish Society in Transition on the difference between Spanish and Northern French opposition to the Guide. Taku's position may be a development of Rashbam's radical insistence on biblical peshat and rejection of metaphysics and esoteric doctrines, "the profound and superior wisdom," as Rashbam calls it, that is not "necessary for the world." (See his Peirush 'al Qohelet, ed. and trans. by Sarah Japhet and Robert B. Salters [Jerusalem, 1985], on Eccles. 2:3.) "Do not wonder that the creation of angels is not recorded [in the Torah]," he writes in Genesis, "because Moses did not write here of angels or Hell or ma'aseh merkavah, but of things we see in the world" (Rashbam on Genesis 1:27).

DAVIS incorporeality with divine unity.68 For him, as for the Jewish philosophers, to assert divine corporeality is to deny divine unity; that is, it is a heresy.69 On the other hand, Simeon ben Samuel is perfectly willing to accept philosophical allegory. We mentioned above that he quotes allegorical inter- pretations from a certain "great sage"; he also creates them himself. For example, at the end of the Book of Joel (4:18), there is a messianic vision: "a fountain shall go out from the house of the Lord, and it will flow into the river of Shittim." As against Rashi, who interprets this verse ke-mishma'o, that is, as speaking of a literal body of water, Sefer Hadrat Qodesh explains the verse allegorically. "Fountain" (ma'ayan) means "rational speculation" ('iyun sikhli). What is "the river of Shittim"? The author answers: "Shittim" is related etymologically to sotah, the "unfaithful wife"; the "river of Shittim" is the "sea of lust." And so he concludes: the verse means that Intellect will purify elemental matter.7" He states generally, "It is sufficient for the one who understands to understand that God, may He be blessed, hid within the letters, the stories, and the parables of the Torah the mysteries of wondrous and awesome wisdom."71 Dogma is in; literalism is out. In the Maimonidean Controversies of the thirteenth century, the Ashke- nazic rabbis defined the min, the kofer, the apiqoros-the heretic-as one who denies the Talmud as understood literally, ki-feshuto. Here in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, the author quotes Maimonides' definition: the apiqoros, the kofer, the min, is someone who denies one of the thirteen fundamental principles of Judaism.72 To put it differently: the limits of allowable or orthodox belief are no longer defined by strict belief in the Talmud, but by belief in Maimonides' principles, including notably the principle of divine incorporeality. 68. Hadrat Qodesh, pp. 30a, 39a. 69. As Joseph Dan suggests in "HIibbur yihud Ashkenazi min ha-me'ah ha-14," Tarbiz 44 (1975): 203-206, this position may be seen as a continuation or perhaps a revival of the position of the Hasidei Ashkenaz, who also accepted the equation of unity and incorpereality. (Dan refers there to Shalem's response to Klausner, but the same may be said of Simeon ben Samuel. Cf. Dan, "Sifrut ha-Yihud shel Hasidei Ashkenaz," Kiryat Sefer 41 [1966]: 533-544.) It is not a simple continuation, however. The Hasidei Ashkenaz had no notion of dogma and did not accuse their opponents of heresy. Simeon ben Samuel does. 70. Hadrat Qodesh, p. 29b. Cf. p. 44a. 71.

It is not coincidence that the final section of Muelhausen's Sefer Nisahon is also a statement of dogma, also based on Maimonides' principles,73 or that R. Avigdor Kara wrote a bilingual (Hebrew and Yiddish) poetic "credo."74 It is not coincidence that sometime in the fifteenth century, Yigdal entered the daily Ashkenazic liturgy. All of these developments mark a new conception of dogma and of theology, a conception influenced by Spanish Jewish culture and by Jewish philosophy. Belief in dogma, furthermore, promoted the study of philosophy as a necessary instrument for understanding religiously mandatory beliefs. Klausner's letter to Shalem was inspired by concern over the dogma of divine unity. Consider finally the following comment by Maharil: The rhymes and poems that people write in Yiddish on the unity of God and the Thirteen Principles-would that they were not written! For most of the ignorant believe that all of the commandments depend on this, and they despair of various positive and negative commandments, such as sisit and tefilin and the study of Torah. And they believe that they fulfill their obligation by saying those rhymes with kavvanah. And those rhymes do not mention a single one of the 613 commandments that Jews are commanded---only the fundamentals of Jewish belief.75 Maharil makes no objection to the contents of the Thirteen Principles, and nowhere suggests that they are not the principles of Judaism.

DAVIS rather than acts; but he too testifies to the widespread change in attitudes that was occurring in his generation. VI The change in exegetical attitudes was neither as sharp nor as sudden as that in attitudes toward dogma, but it too was of considerable cultural and religious importance. There seems to have been confusion, even at the time of the Maimonidean Controversies, as to what precise exegetical principles the Ashkenazic anti- Maimonists demanded. Several texts demand peshat interpretation. As R. Samuel b. Solomon of Falaise and his brother Isaac b. Solomon announce, "[One must not] question the rewards of Gan cEden ... and the other aggadot ... which our rabbis have interpreted literally [ki-feshutan]."76 But other texts actually speak of a demand that Talmud-and perhaps Scripture as well-must be interpreted only in accordance with Rashi's commentary!7 Clearly the anti-Maimonists were climbing out on an exegetical limb, so to speak. Why should Rashi be allowed an authority on questions of aggadah that his Tosafist successors never came close to giving him on questions either of halakhah or of scriptural interpretation? The demand for literalism is itself fairly extreme. Such an exegetical stance is anything but typical, after all, of the Talmud itself, or of the Midrash.17 In demanding aggadic literalism, furthermore, the Ashkenazic anti- Maimonists were conducting a polemic not only against philosophy, but also, within Ashkenazic culture, against the Hasidei Ashkenaz. That polemic is explicit in Ketav Tamim, and it may be implicit in the views of the other rabbis as well. The Hasidei Ashkenaz were committed to the nonliteral interpretation of Scripture and aggadah. Although their own systems of mystical exegesis were based far more on modes such as gematriya and notariqon than on allegory itself, they were not opposed to allegory.79 76. See Shatzmiller, "Le-Temunat ha-mahloqet," p. 139. 77. See (1) the letter of Samuel b. Abraham Saporta, p. 152, (2) J. Shatzmiller, "Igarto shel R. Asher b. Gershom," p. 139 78.

In the exegetical practice of the following century, we find a variety of stances, coming out of a variety of Ashkenazic traditions. R. Meir ha-Kohen, for example (fl. 1300; a student of R. Meir of Rothenburg), takes a position of aggadic literalism against Maimonides on the question of the reality of Hell.80 Another student of R. Meir's, on the other hand, R. Solomon Simhah of Troyes, in his Sefer ha-Maskil, written about 1298, rejects the literal sense of certain aggadot. But he rejects philosophy as well on the ground of its use of allegory, and he suggests a norm of scriptural literalism.81 At about the same period, Samson of Joigny, author of such as Exod. 19:4 'I have carried you on eagle's wings,' ... And there are things that may be understood as allegories, in the matter of the Garden of Eden and Gehinnom and the World of Judgment and the World of Mercy, although they are [also] literally true." On the exegetical methods of R. Eleazar of Worms and R. Judah he-Hasid, see Ivan Marcus, "Exegesis for the Few and for the Many: Judah he-Hasid's Biblical Commentaries," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 8 (1989): 1-24 (Eng. sec.). Cf. Joseph Dan, "Sefer ha-Hokhmah le-R. El'azar mi-Worms u-mashma'uto le-toldot toratah ve-sifrutah shel Hasidut Ashkenaz," Zion 27 (1964): 168-181. As Marcus mentions, medieval Ashkenazic exegesis after the twelfth century, including the exegesis of the Hasidei Ashkenaz, has not been properly studied. 80. See Hagahot Maymoniyot (a commentary on the Mishneh Torah, printed in the standard rabbinic editions) on Hilkhot Teshuvah 8:1. See also his comment on Teshuvah 3:7, where he rejects Maimonides' definition of heresy and suggests Rashi's: "The heretics [minim] are those who overturn the words of the living God." A passage from the thirteenth-century polemical work, Vikuah R. Yehi'el mi-Paris, also seems to take a stance of aggadic literalism. "In [the aggadot] there are matters too wondrous for the kofer and the apiqoros and the min to believe. ... If you wish, believe them; if you do not wish, do not believe them. For no law depends on them. However, I know that the sages of the Talmud wrote only that which is true and correct. And if [the aggadot] are strange to those who hear them, are there not very many like this in the Bible as well?" (ed. R. Margaliyot [Lvov, n.d], p. 13). The author of the polemic rejects scriptural literalism, but here he suggests strongly that one who does not believe in the aggadot is a kofer an apiqoros, and a min. This passage is often interpreted as a statement of the absence of authority in aggadic interpretation. It is not that. Cf. Muelhausen's Sefer Nisahon (repr. with introduction by Frank Talmage [Jerusalem, 1984]) par. 112, a passage based on this one that goes much farther, however, in allowing that aggadot may not be literally true. 81. I have not been able to look at the manuscript of this work, which is in the Guenzberg Collection in Moscow (MS. no. 508; there is also a microfilm in the Makhon le-Taslumei Kitvei Yad in Jerusalem). I rely entirely on the description and discussion by Israel Ta-Shema, "Sefer ha-Maskil: hibbur Yehudi-Sarfati bilti yadu'a mi-sof ha-me'ah ha-13," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 2 (1982): 416-438.

DAVIS a commentary to Solomon ibn Gabirol's Mivhar Peninim, repeats Saadiah's argument against the literal interpretation of divine attributes, adding a quotation from Maimonides' Mishneh Torah;82 while in England, Jacob b. Judah Hazan, whose 'Es HIayyim is modeled on the Mishneh Torah, quotes Maimonides' statement of the principle of divine incorporeality.83 Furthermore, sodot, esoteric interpretations of Bible verses-mainly gematriyot--continue to be quoted, some in the name of R. Judah Hasid or R. Eleazar Rokeah of Worms, in the exegetical anthologies typical of the period, such as Pa'neah Raza by R. Isaac b. Judah. (It is significant in this respect that traditions of the Hasidei Ashkenaz are quoted in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh as well; Simeon ben Samuel speaks of "my teachers, the Hasidim.")84 In sum: there seems to have been uncertainty and conflict among Ashke- nazic Jews over the question of aggadic literalism throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Were the Hasidei Ashkenaz correct, Ashkenazic Jews wondered, in following Saadiah Gaon's nonliteral interpretations of certain sections of the Torah and the aggadah? Or was Taku correct in denouncing all nonliteralism, even that of the Hasidei Ashkenaz, as heresy? This is precisely the question that Klausner asks Shalem. Klausner refers to Saadiah on the one hand and to Ketev Tamim on the other, and asks Shalem, innocently as it were, which of them is correct.85 The enthusiasm for allegory evinced by the author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh was extraordinary within Ashkenazic Judaism, both in his own day and later. A restrained scriptural literalism remained customary among Ashkenazic thinkers. Muelhausen, for example, does not interpret all aggadot literally. He writes in one place, "Many midrashim were said as allegories and riddles, for great secrets are contained within them."86 But in another place he writes, Yehiel (yet another student of R. Meir of Rothenburg) does not mention literalism in his letters during the 1306 Maimonidean Controversy, neither in his letters published in Minhat Qena'ot nor in his 1321 statement against philosophy in his responsa (55:9). 82.

Israel Isserlein, the major Ashkenazic Bible commentator of the fifteenth century, although interested mostly in the peshat of Scripture in gen- eral and in Rashi's commentary in particular, insists also on the acceptability of multiple interpretations of the text.90 He does not believe that mystical or esoteric interpretations of Scripture must be rejected (he was a student of kabbalah), nor that all scriptural terms-including, notably, descriptions of God-are to be understood literally."9 In the surviving fragments of Isserlein's sermons, moreover, he makes frequent use of allegorical interpretation.92 In 1559, a controversy over the study of philosophy took place in the community of Posen, and literalism was again one of the central issues. 87. From Sefer ha-Eshkol, printed in Kaufman, Muelhausen, p. 143. 88. See n. 16 above. The document is discussed by Yuval, Hakhanmimn be-doram, pp. 308-310. I interpret it differently from Yuval in my thesis, pp. 105-108. 89. Notice also Zioni's statement, which rejects allegorization of aggadah, but seems to identify peshat with kabbalistic interpretation(!). "Every intelligent person [maskil] will understand that there are many things in the words of the sages of blessed memory, in the aggadot, that sound to fools like riddles and parables. But to the kabbalists they are simple [peshutinm], bright as the noonday sun" (Sefer Zioni, p. 27b, on Exod. 12:9). Zioni's example of a difficult aggadah is the statement (b. Ber. 6a) that God wears tefilin. 90. See Isserlein, Bei'ur 'al Peirush Rashi (Rivo di Trento, 1562; reprint ed., New York[?], 1987), p. 20a, on multiple interpretations; cf. p. 10b on miracles, and pp. 4b-5a on whether the patriarchs observed the commandments. 91. See ibid., p. 13b, a kabbalistic interpretation of the Tabernacle; p. 8b, his reference to a kabbalistic understanding of the aggadah (b. Ta'anit 5b) that Jacob did not die; and esp. p. 19b on God's knowledge. Isserlein quotes Mishneh Torah, Yesodei ha-Torah 2:10, where Maimonides distinguishes divine knowledge from human knowledge, to explain why the Targum does not translate the phrase "God ... knew" (Deut. 2:7) "according to its peshat." Cf. Leqet Yosher, vol. 1, p. 119. On Isserlein's knowledge of kabbalah, see David Tamar, "Demuto ha-ruhanit shel R. Yisra'el Isserlein," Sinai 32 (1952): 177, and Yuval, Hakhanmim be-doranm, p. 308. 92. See in Leqet Yosher, ed. Jacob Freimann (Berlin, 1903), vol. 1, p. 71 (leaven = evil inclination); p. 98 (four camps = four holidays); pp. 120-121 (seven fruits); p. 122 (three gates).</page><page sequence="26">220 JOSEPH M. DAVIS But times had changed since the thirteenth century, when the Ashkenazic rabbinate had decisively rejected philosophy. In 1559, R. Abraham Horowitz, who argued the case for philosophy and against literalism, won a clear victory over his opponent, R. Joseph Ashkenazi.93 Philosophy continued to have opponents in the Ashkenazic rabbinate, but they were mainly kabbalistic opponents. Aggadic literalism was no longer the test of orthodoxy. VII We must consider, finally, the question of kabbalah. Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, we said, quotes frequently from works of Spanish kabbalah, such as the Zohar, Shacarei Orah, Recanati, and others.94 Indeed, as we have said, it quotes more kabbalistic works than philosophical ones. The history of the relation of kabbalah and philosophy is a tangled one. Without entering into its many turns, I would suggest that among late medieval Ashkenazic Jews, the study of philosophy and the study of kabbalah were likely to go hand in hand. (This continued to be true in the sixteenth century.)9 Muelhausen, Zioni, and Simeon ben Samuel are all examples of this pattern. For Ashkenazic Jewry in the late Middle Ages, Spanish Jewish philosophy and Spanish kabbalah pointed in the same direction, namely, away from literalism, and toward esotericism, allegory, and dogma. For the author of Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, both Jewish philosophy and kabbalah were legitimate realms of esoteric metaphysical doctrine; both were also legitimate bodies of nonliteral interpretation of Scripture. In fact, we can put it more strongly. The author does not appear to distinguish at all 93. On the Posen controversy, see esp. Philip Bloch, "Der Streit um den Moreh des Maimonides in Posen," Monatsschrift flir Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentunms 47 (1903): 153-169, 263-279, 346-347; S. P. Rabinowitz, 'Iqvot shel hofesh de'ot ba-rabanut shel Polin (Jerusalem, 1959); Gershom Scholem, "Yedi'ot hadashot 'al R. Yosef Ashkenazi ha-tana mi-Sefat," Tarbiz 28 (1958): 59-89 and 201-235. See Scholem, "Yedi'ot," p. 201, for Ashkenazi's admission of defeat. 94. The author refers to the Zohar (Hadrat Qodesh, p. 34b, 40a), Shacarei Orah (p. 29a, 30b), Recanati (p. 41a), Sefer Yesirah (p. 31a), Sefer ha-Bahir (p. 33a, 33b), R. Ezra (p. 41a), Nahmanides (p. 35a), Sefer Malki'el (p. 39a), Ma'arekhet Eloqut (p. 29a, 37b), and "the recent kabbalists" (p. 39b). He uses Spanish kabbalistic phrases without references (e.g., pp. 31a, 37b). He also quotes R. Judah Hasid: pp. 30b, 38b. 95. See, e.g., Davis, "R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller," pp. 155-180.</page><page sequence="27">PHILOSOPHY, DOGMA, AND EXEGESIS IN MEDIEVAL ASHKENAZIC JUDAISM 221 between philosophy and kabbalah.96 Much of the vocabulary that he uses, such as "sages" and "mysteries," applies equally to kabbalistic writings and to philosophical-allegorical writings such as the Guide. In the teachings presented in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh, as we have seen, philosophical and kabbalistic doctrines are mixed, combined, identified, and even confused. There are certain ironies here, ironies of cultural misunderstanding. Within Spanish Jewish culture, kabbalah and philosophy were polar oppo- sites--opposites with a middle ground, perhaps, but opposites nonetheless. Viewed, however, from the perspective of Ashkenazic culture, they were so close as to be almost indistinguishable. It is ironic as well that the influence of the medieval Jewish philosophers, so many of whom had doubts about ex nihilo creation and about particular providence, should have been to make these beliefs into dogmas, to shut off doubts on these issues among Ashkenazic Jews." Yet dogma, we must recognize, was not only one of the concerns of medieval Jewish philosophy; it was also one of its creations. Literal interpretation, the hermeneutical focus on peshuto shel Miqra, was first put forward in the tenth and eleventh centuries by Spanish Jewish thinkers and exegetes.98 Its entry into Ashkenazic biblical exegesis in Rashi's day, in the eleventh century and on into the twelfth, is an example of the influence of Spanish Jewish culture, as we have said. However, that very principle, the principle of peshat, was used in the thirteenth century as an instrument of opposition to Spanish Jewish influences in the shape of Jewish philosophy. And when the influence of Spanish Jewish culture, including both Jewish philosophy and kabbalah, came to be felt by Ashkenazic Jews again in the late Middle Ages, in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh and elsewhere, it consisted largely of a rejection of the earlier hermeneutical goal, and a new emphasis on the philosophical and kabbalistic meanings of Scripture. 96. Muelhausen did distinguish the two. On Muelhausen's kabbalistic views, cf. "Derashat Torat ha-Shem Temimah le-R. Yom Tov Lipman Muelhausen," ed. Israel Weinstock, in Sinai 84 (1979): 126-132; "Peirush Sefer Yesirah le-R. Yom Tov Lipman Muelhausen," ed. Israel Weinstock, in Tenzirin 2 (1981): 93-122. 97. Occasionally, Simeon ben Samuel uses his commentary to undercut or limit the Thirteen Principles. For example, the ninth principle, that the divine law is unchanging, he comments, does not really rule out changes by the "sages of the passing generations, . . . according to the time and place, for the needs of the hour" (p. 34a). Also, his commentary on the fourth principle seems to identify ex nihilo creation with the emanation of the sefirot (p. 31a). 98. See Weiss-Halivni, Peshat and Derash (above n.78) pp. 79-82.</page><page sequence="28">222 JOSEPH M. DAVIS We must therefore recognize the range of religious ideals and the various types of spiritual leadership that existed in Ashkenazic Judaism in the fifteenth century. We must see the slow but sure sea-change brought about by the gradual acceptance of the Maimonidean dogmas, the acceptance of the very notion of dogma, the reluctant but gradual acceptance of allegorical interpretation, and in general the influence of philosophical and kabbalistic ideas and values. The late Middle Ages saw a complex dialogue between Mediterranean and Ashkenazic Judaism. Sefer Hadrat Qodesh is testimony to one part of that dialogue.
