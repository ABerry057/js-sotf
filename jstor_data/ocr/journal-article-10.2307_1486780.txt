<plain_text><page sequence="1">Emanuel Melzer. No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1997. xii, 235 pp. The years 1935-1939 constitute a sad chapter in the history of Polish Jewry. Jews were exposed to persecutions, violent attacks, legislative and economic discrimination, hostile propaganda, and boycotts. Nevertheless, Polish Jews had their own parliamentary representation, as well as numerous political parties and social organizations. Jewish education and cultural life blossomed. In some countries, such as Germany or Romania, the Jewish situation was worse than in Poland, where many Jews, like Calel Perechodnik, the author of the memoirs of a Jewish ghetto policeman, considered themselves "good patriotic Poles," "adored Polish poetry," "did not pay too much attention to the problem of anti-Semitism," and "did not take notice that the ground was on fire under our feet."' It is difficult, therefore, to present an objective and balanced picture of prewar Polish Jewry. Emanuel Melzer, a scholar teaching at the Diaspora Research Institute of Tel Aviv University, a co-editor of the journal Gal-Ed: On the History of the Jews in Poland, and the author of numerous works 1.

His book, which is probably the most detailed and the best existing monograph on its subject, describes the efforts of Polish Jews to secure their existence and realize their political goals. It also depicts changes in the attitude of the Polish people toward their Jewish fellow citizens. Melzer's monograph began as a doctoral dissertation, based mostly on the Yiddish and Polish press and on archival material in Israel. It was published in Hebrew by the Diaspora Institute in 1982. The book under review is a condensed, updated, and modified English version of the dissertation. For this edition the author added numerous new sources that he gathered and analyzed during his additional research in several important archives in Poland, Great Britain, and the United States. The book is divided into ten chapters and a short summation. The first chapter, "Background: The Pilsudski Years," describes the 1918 revival of Poland and its history until 1935. It also presents Polish political parties, Poland's economic problems, and the international situation, and a description of Polish Jewish life. It shows divisions among the Jews and their various attitudes toward Poland. The chapter provides a good general Polish context (Melzer's knowledge of Polish history and historiography is superb), although it includes some minor debatable issues. The author overestimates the Nazi influence on the National Democrats (Endek). It was apparent but, simulta- neously, limited by the traditional Endek hostility toward Germans. Melzer's discussion of Poland's international situation and diplomatic cooperation with Germany does not mention the 1925 Locarno treaty and its consequences for Poland, Pilsudski's plan for a preventive war against Germany, and the Western reaction. The second chapter describes the disintegration of Pilsudski's political camp after his death. It shows how the Pilsudski faction, which remained in power, tried to attract the Endeks. Some of them cooperated with the ruling elites and "infected" them with strong antisemitism, others used the anti-Jewish campaign to attract greater popular support and win over more people to the Endek side. The chapter depicts the reaction of the Polish and Jewish political parties to the anti-Jewish campaign. The two following chapters describe "The Economic Campaign Against the Jews" and "Anti-Jewish Violence: Riots, Pogroms, Recriminations and Responses." The author explains how the economic boycott created a pogrom- like atmosphere and eventually turned into a series of anti-Jewish riots. Not only does the book depict several pogroms, it also describes Polish attempts, especially the activities of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), to defend the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 419 Jews and stop the violence. The fifth chapter is devoted to "'Ghetto Benches,' Agitation, and Violence in the Universities"; the sixth chapter to "The Kosher Slaughtering Ban and Other Anti-Jewish Legislation." Eventually, the ban was not introduced and state control over slaughtering was initiated. The campaign against ritual slaughtering, like several other anti-Jewish activities, was indeed started to gain political support among the non-Jewish populace. The seventh chapter, "The Failure of Jewish Leadership in Poland," is perhaps the most interesting in the entire book. It explains why Jewish politicians were unable to coordinate their activities or to create'a common leadership. Some readers might, however, raise questions concerning this chapter. For example, was there really a "mounting sense of catastrophe" among the Jewish masses in Poland in early 1939 (p. 112)? The eighth chapter, entitled "Ukrainians and Germans in Poland: Fluctuating Relations and Anti-Jewish Agitation," also provokes doubts. It states that the "friendly relations between [Poland and Germany] symbolized by the non-aggression pact of 1934" affected Polish public opinion, "especially with regard to the Jewish question" (pp. 116-117). In fact, this effect was limited. Moreover, Poland also had a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. The last chapter, "Toward War" (which follows the interesting ninth chapter, "Jewish Emigration: Efforts and Realities"), also makes some debatable assertions, including Melzer's view that Polish foreign policy was "based upon Polish consultation with and at times even cooperation with Germany" (p. 154). Sadly, Polish antisemites were nasty enough without the influence of the Nazi party. In general, Melzer's book, balanced, objective, well written, and based on an impressive number of primary and secondary sources, constitutes an exemplary scholarly work and should be read by everyone who hopes to understand the contemporary history of Polish Jewry.
