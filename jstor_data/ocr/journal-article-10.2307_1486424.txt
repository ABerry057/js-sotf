<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? by HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Yeshiva University Not how halakhic texts tell stories about other things, but how they tell stories about themselves is our concern here. Confronting us is not the problem of extracting evidence regarding trade or communal organization from law, but the question of how one cracks the colorless and highly imper- sonal mold into which the thought of the medieval period was cast to reveal a world of individuality, development, and ambivalence. Can the fragmen- tary and recalcitrant halakhic texts be made to talk history? Attempting to argue for the affirmative, I would like to trace the origin and fate of one doctrine over the course of some two centuries. Instead of a running account, it seems wisest for our purposes to interrogate each piece of evidence separately, hoping to see if a continuous narrative emerges from the cross-examination, and whether parts of the story are of wider significance. (The importance of the story as a whole would emerge only in the framework of a much larger study.) In brief, I should like to try to reconstruct step by step a small chapter in the history of the halakhah. As the technique employed is that of piecemeal analysis, I hope that the reader will forgive the temporary lapse from brevity.

The social dif- ficulties that this injunction entailed are common knowledge; the economic burdens, though less known, were no less great. Wine played a far greater role in the Middle Ages than it does now. Water was not generally drunk, and tea and coffee had not yet come to Europe. Fresh fruits were unavailable for a good part of the year, and whiskey was still undiscovered. Thus thirst could be quenched only by beer and wine. And the thirst was great; partly because the meats were heavily spiced (no other method of food preservation was available), partly because drink was the only escape for the poor and the major entertainment of the wealthy. So drink people did, and on a heroic scale. Indeed the quantities consumed stagger the imagination. The importance of wine in the daily fare gave to it a role in the economic life of the period that we would scarcely dream of. How were the men of the North, England and Scandinavia-great drinkers all-to quench their thirst? Mead and beer were available-indeed, in England a full third of the grain crop at the time of the Conquest was used for beer production-but these were looked upon as lower class drinks. The well-to-do drank wine, and wine was to be had primarily by import. So as Pirenne first perceived and Dion then magisterially chronicled, wine was a major, and in some places in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the major, commodity of inter- national trade.' Many a city grew to prominence and many a merchant at- tained wealth because of wine. Domestically wine was our water, coffee, and liquor wrapped into one. Economically it was analogous to the modern plastics or electronics industry. The laws of y.n. did not then regulate some All manuscripts except those of Cambridge University, Hechal Shelomoh, Jerusalem, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America were viewed at the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts of the National and University Library in Jerusalem. 1.

Halakhically the problem is at what stage does the must (crushed grapes) cease to be simply grape juice and as such indistinguishable from any other fruit extract (mei perot, mashqin ha-yoSe'in), and take on the unique status of "wine."2 Economically, what lies at stake is until when may Jewish and Gentile operations be meshed and the forms of Jewish enterprise in- distinguishable from the general ones, and, from what stage must Jewish wine production be conducted in isolation and in a more expensive fashion. Tannaitic opinion on this point underwent change. Originally the cutoff stage given was either the liquid's entrance into the wine pit (yeridah la-bor, qippui), or a later phase, the introduction of the wine into the wine barrel (shillui be-haviyyot). Subsequently it was advanced to a stage known as hamshakhah and this advancement was ratified by the Talmud. 1) As the entire discussion in the Middle Ages revolves around seven or eight lines in the Talmud, and as Rashi's position on this problem will oc- cupy a good part of our study, it seems best to cite the relevant passages together with his comments.3 2. The halakhah (like common law) prefers local definitions and what may be defined as "wine" in regard to y.n. may very well be grape juice in other areas of Jewish law, and vice versa. The formulation here presented is medieval, not talmudic. The Talmud did not discuss the problem in terms of "wine" status; it views the juice as "wine" immediately upon extraction from the grape. It spoke rather of darkan le-nassekh-at what stage of the wine process do Gen- tiles begin to use it for libation (Tosefta, ed. M. S. Zuckermandel [reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1963], 'Avodah Zarah, 7:3). Medieval authors saw the matter differently. Rashi (below) spoke of nip 1P n'nnn inrm n5,nn ,r'y 1l Do ," while the commentator par excellence of Provence, R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres, explained thus: Da" "T. 1r5Y n51i 17" n-nn r5y n1mn1 m,n inn (Perush ha-Rabad 'al 'Avodah Zarah [New York, 1961], p. 148). One may see in this perspective a shift from genuine fear of libation to formal definition, indicative of the transition from libating societies to non-libating ones. One should note, however, that the move to formal definition was begun by the Babylonian Talmud when it defined the stages of the receptivity to libation by the categories of gemar melakhah operative in the laws of tithes (see text, sec. 1). 3.

Rashi's remarks are straightforward enough and passed the intensive scrutiny of the Tosafists without critique or comment. 2) If we leave the printed page of the Talmud to explore the literature of the eleventh century, seeking to enter the milieu which produced Rashi's lucid exposition, the first discussion that we encounter is a private one - between Rashi and his son-in-law, R. Meir of Rameru.4 It goes thus: X5N 13 1'a ] n i "'WI n'nr' ni ''nnn "r "n 'r, 1"i n .'11n1 n1mn tt1n n¥1, x'w Te cont l n n 1 is5 5D1ha r;lly nal, and n *1 ot 5 n5n by ac it dd then rnms .ponsu .lilnn 3T rp;lw innn "nRx 1in i TO5 .nnl ino oivion nnn pn 5 Hisicall ,1t i 3rmae and nthe m rDinl oDf gp, xK box, v-g3 n; i r since t rnyhoe s afnnnrn nspt 1x1 out ISxlen [i ] ann at work.

Historically this "banality" is both informative and ex- plicable. Informative it is that R. Meir did not at the time possess his father- in-law's commentary; otherwise he would never have had to inquire as to the meaning of gat et, r, ve-gargutni, since those terms are spelled out at length in that work. As we shall seein (Ne w York , Ra rote , t or dictated no less than four commentaries on the tractate 'Avodah Zarah;6 this query clearly antedates ig l. s passa s t kenrm al a ery reason to assume that this repeated endeavor was a protracted one-each effort reflecting a rethinking on the part of the author-it would appear then that this responsum issues from an early period in Rashi's career and mirrors his initial views before they found formal articulation in his writings. The "banality" is explicable by the fact that the tractate of 'Avodah cited in this study were checked against manuscripts. For the reader's convenience, however, I have generally cited the printed text, adducing only those variants which are of significance. 4. Teshuvot Rashi, ed.

See text, sec. 6. 157</page><page sequence="6">HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Zarah was neither studied nor taught in certain circles, and the Rhine academies generally had but an imperfect knowledge of it. This is a surpris- ing, indeed almost unbelievable fact in light of the centrality of a tractate which treats y.n. and all other aspects of Jewish-Gentile relations, but it is a fact nevertheless. No less a figure than R. Eliezer b. Isaac known by his con- temporaries as R. Eliezer Ha-Gadol (the Great) did not know that milk for- bade meat products only be-noten fa'am, because he had never studied (or had but imperfectly studied) 'Avodah Zarah.7 If a scholar of such stature could err on so basic a matter, it was small wonder if men of lesser mold sometimes found themselves at sea in the tractate. Rashi's fourfold efforts in this tractate stem from this fact: in 'Avodah Zarah he was starting from 7.

These texts prove something only about two leading scholars of Worms. An in-depth study, however, of the literature of the Worms and Mainz academies, found in the Ma'asei ge'onim, Pardes, and Ha-'oreh, shows the imperfect grasp that the Rhine scholars had of this tractate, one not even vaguely on par with their command of H ullin for ex- ample. A simple example of the heavyhanded belaboring of the halakhically obvious in this period (and inconceivable in any later one) is found in Ma'asei ge'onim (Berlin, 1910), p. 81: nmry 5xY U',K rtw 5y. Contrast this with the one line disposal of the problem by Rashi toward the close of the responsum cited above. The fact that the Makhirites thought these proofs worthy of being included in their work says a great deal indeed. I am not contending that no commentarial tools on 'Avodah Zarah were available. Rashi's talents alone could never have divined the meaning of Persian or Greek words; only a commentarial tradition could provide him with this information. The 'A rukh cites a Mainz commentary on this tractate twice, or pos- sibly four times (s.v. 'nr I, n'vnpoS ,5n VIII, '51 II), but all these are explanations of difficult words or gnomic remarks in the Talmud. Not one is topical or thematic. There is all the dif- ference in the world between a lexical handbook like that of R. Nahshon Gaon (Teshuvot ge'onim qadmonim [Berlin, 1848], pp. 39bff.) or other skeletal aids and an in-depth, running commentary. ([a] The statement of R. Meir b.

Actual- ly the two texts say the same thing. I doubt that R. Eliezer Ha-Gadol literally never studied the tractate; rather, he did not have a firm grasp of it. Functionally, however, not to be clear about a basic matter and not to have studied it is one and the same thing.

Maimon (Jerusalem, 1956), p. 311, n. 18; Froim Kupfer, Perush Rashi 'al Mo'ed Qatan (Jerusalem, 1961), introd., p. 15], but there is no evidence for such an inroad in the Rhinelands.) 158</page><page sequence="7">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? commentarial scratch. Bereft of any guides, R. Meir approached the talmudic passages (sugyot) treating y.n. and soon dispatched a request for help. But if the first question of R. Meir is comprehensible, the second is not. He inquired of his father-in-law whether the decision lay with the mishnah 'aharonah or not. Could the decision possibly lie with the mishnah rishonah? If a court reversed itself, would any tyro imagine that one would follow its earlier decision?! The amora R. Huna, moreover, endorsed the mishnah 'aharonah and no dissenting voice is to be found in the Talmud. In light of this what other ruling is conceivable?8 Rashi's reply is no less problematic-on closer scrutiny. He explains the stucture of talmudic treading floors and translates it into contemporary terms. The cuve (gigit, wooden tub),9 now in use for pressing, corresponds to the gat, the receptacle under the pipe to the bor. Rashi then proceeds to in- form the inquirer that the decision lay with R. Huna. If the juice becomes y.n. even in the gat (as R. Huna contended) and the contemporary cuve is equivalent to the gat, the wine then in the cuve becomes y.n. in the strict halakhic sense. Yet Rashi carefully refuses to draw that conclusion and writes instead: i3mnK [!] n;rin , rL,y T" Uo. Note that it becomes y.n. not legally, but only as a result of common custom. In sum, we have here an astonishing query from Rameru and a reply with a non sequitur. 3) We have no other writings of R. Meir which we might probe for a pos- sible solution, but we do have some of Rashi. As the problem hinges around the application of R. Huna's ruling, let us concentrate our attention there. It will be recalled that Rashi commented on the rule ;niv lju?vn1? ,rnnmn p,': T" 1m , 1" thus: 1" 'ip pnnn;n t' lpy,n r m rv Kn iV nm1Yv p1n mlvy nflrv. However, R.

Meir actually asked a pointed question whether the decision lay with the mishnah 'aharonah or not. He may simply have asked for a general clarification of the sugyah. Personally I do not believe this to be the case; see text, sec. 8. If, however, the reader disagrees, he should feel free to strike this paragraph from the text. 9. Arsene Darmesteter and D. S.

The additional three words nay;n In mn:am are no minor matter. Hamshakhah means "flow," and simply read, R. Huna's doctrine gives the moment of flow, the moment the liquid begins to move, begins to descend downward, as the time when the grape juice assumes the status of wine and becomes subject to y.n. And Rashi's comments in the Talmud only locate the first occurrence of such a flow in the normal process of wine production. Not so the doctrine reported by Ri. The principle there enunciated is one of separation of the liquid from the pulp. Grape juice ceases to be just "grape juice" and becomes "wine" when the sifting of the juice from the pulp begins. In other words hamshakhah, flow, is not a criterion in and of itself, but simply a means to an end. As water seeks its own level, liquids will de- scend more rapidly than pulp, and the process of separation thus sets in with the onset of this downward flow. If the halakhah must draw a line between "grape juice" and "wine," it is reasonable to contend that so long as the grape lies interspersed with the juice, the liquid is viewed as "grape juice." Only when it is separated does it become an independent entity-"wine." Why, however, should liquidity or flow be determinative? True, wine is a liquid, but so is grape juice. Why is flow more a characteristic of one than of the other? 4) As the doctrine of separation is sharper and more comprehensible than that of liquidity, one might be inclined to suspect that later generations put point and clarity into Rashi's doctrine, and that, as so often happens in legal history, a great jurist (Ri) unconsciously transformed the older doctrine of flow into the more acute one of straining and distillation. An anonymous little handbook on y.n. found in MS Paris Alliance 482 reports, however, the same version of Rashi, and we read there (fol. 33v): ,"'tn t,'m p,5* -Yn n 3mi plinn rriy nxm;i yysKi 5s1 5I 1·"fKXl J5K '"*3yn mwn 71S"[nn p11 ... r nip TK ',3Yn m3sn3t pnnn¥. The relationship between the two texts merits now a few remarks. Had we only the Alliance manuscript, we would simply disregard it, for the first half of the sentence ('l5K 15'K ca, n n3Do) is (as we shall see later 2) an edited version of another work, and we would be justified in as- voy a 1ir: r-mn:a]. Ri's son, R. Elbanan, however, was still alive [fol. 59d]. R.T.'s death cannot be inferred from the o"r found after his name; this may easily be a scribal addition.) 11. I.e., Rashi would have viewed this as an instance of hamshakhah. 12. See text, sec. 4, end. 160</page><page sequence="9">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? suming that the author similarly edited the latter part. But his citation cor- responds almost precisely with that of Ri. Had we Ri's words alone, we would have suspected him of unconscious sophistication of Rashi's doctrine. Together the two reports seem to corroborate and validate each other. But are they independent witnesses? Ri clearly could not have copied from MS Alliance for the author of this little guide to y.n. lived a century later. But could MS Alliance have taken his information from Ri? R. Isaac's responsum was discovered by R. Hayyim 'Or Zaru'a, that is to say, at the close of the tosafist period. It is not found, to the best of my knowledge, in any other source in print or manuscript.'3 Nor is this late appearance ac- cidental. An investigation of the writings of the Tosafists (Ri's own pupils) on matters of hamshakhah shows that they were unfamiliar with this respon- sum.'4 To all appearances, it was a private note to an individual party,'5 of which no copy was kept in Dampierre and which surfaced fortuitously a century later. There is nothing to make us suspect that the author of the Al- liance manuscript, an epigone of the French school,'6 was aware of it. Cer- tainly the rest of his handbook bears no mark of such an acquaintance. To all appearances the witnesses are independent. Unable to shake Ri's report, we turn to the printed text of Rashi and ask whether it may not be in error or whether perhaps the several readings reflect the different editions (mahadurot) of Rashi's commentary. Mahadurot are a thorny problem in Rashi studies, but there is little doubt that Rashi did rework his commentary on the tractate of 'Avodah Zarah- although, as J. N. Epstein and, more recently, J. Frankel have insisted the editing took the form of specific (small-scale) emendations rather than that of actual rewriting. 7 The text in front of the Tosafists was generally uniform 13. Not even in the encyclopedic work of R. Hayyim's father, the 'Or zaru'a. 14. They. do not discuss, for example, the problem posed by mDn5 Inlml lrn I=1 or that of submerged pulp. Note also that R.

Blau, [New York, 1969], p. 266) and is followed in this by our Tosafot, ad loc. and the Semag, injunction 148. From Ri's responsum it is abundantly clear that R.T. forbade what he did on emotional grounds, and that the argument of ltK is Ri's own rationale. See below, n. 94. 15. Not too much can be garnered from the opening remarks of R. Isaac nx nSKxv an, as the term rnx is used loosely in the tosafist period, not even signifying at times a relative. 16. The work is wholly derivative of the Sefer ha-terumah and the Semag. It is entitled mrn m-' -1"nr m t" r (fol. 33r).

Only one manuscript of Rashi on 'Avodah Zarah has come down to us, MS Parma 1292,18 but luckily it would seem to be in some sense a different mahadurah or, more accurately, to have retained some readings of another mahadurah. 9 In the definition of hamshakhah, however, its reading is identical with the printed text. The Rashi on the Alfasi is of problematic origin, but on 'Avodah Zarah it too contains readings of different mahadurot,20 and David Blondheim long ago drew attention to the rich manuscript collections of such Rashis. But on our problem, again, they only corroborate the printed version.21 Testimonia work equally against us. The printed Tosafot ad loc. pp. 1-13 and passim. For bibliography on the problem, see A. N. Z. Roth, "Mi-perushei R. Yehudah b. Natan," Sefer ha-yovel li-khevod S. K. Mirsky (New York, 1958), pp. 285-86. See also the remarks of Shama Friedman, Perush R. Yonatan Ha-Kohen mi-Lunel 'al Bava Qamma (Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 28-29, and J. Frankel's rejoinder in the published version of his thesis of the same name (Jerusalem, 1976), pp. 14-19. 18. MS 172 described by Moritz Steinscheider in his Catalog der Hebraischen Handschrifien in der Stadtbibliothek zu Hamburg (Hamburg, 1878) as a commentary of Rashi on 'Avodah Zarah, contains the text of the Talmud only. 19. Rashi long wavered, for example, over whether imn of a Gentile forbade wine ;r';N, and our printed text, being a mixture of two mahadurot, shows inconsistencies. See 58b s.v. n0ox (and Tosafot, ad loc., s.v. xKx); 60a s.v. xvnn (and Tosafot ad loc., s.v. -tny) and the little sum- mary found at the end of the chapter, 61b s.v. lm; which if not actually written by Rashi, was dictated by him to his pupils (see Pisqei ha-Rosh, ad loc., sec. 13 and Tosefot R. Yehudah mi- Paris [above, n. 14], pp. 281, 294). The Parma manuscript (fol. 104v) reads for the passage 58b s.v. nonD: -n'.Y nprnn ia n3n3 1 rn xnorX imnS pn 1nm Y xhn Y "Y1 and in 60b s.v. xlnn lacks the sinx 3,ur5 of the printed text. (From the language of all the Tosafists cited above it is clear that they viewed the concluding appendix on 61b as the work of Rashi. However, in MS Man- tua Comunita Israelitica 30, [see below, n. 34] the signature Qtt"n pr5 is found. For this type of problem, see text, sec. 4, end.) 20. For example: Rashi was long perplexed by the problem of whether rotehin and qinsa are effective in purging tarred vessels (see 'Avodah Zarah 33a-b), and in the course of his lifetime held different opinions. In the printed text (33b s.v. xn5nm, and similarly MS Parma and a cita- tion in the Temim de'im [Tummat yesharim (Venice, 1662), no. 96] he denies the efficacy of both, even post facto. Rashbam, however, reports that Rashi was willing to admit qinsa post facto and go along with the use of rotehin ('Or zaru'a [Jerusalem, 1887] 4: 170). And in the Rashi on Alfasi the entire section of the printed text from p,v'Yw a:n; onward is missing. And a similar text was before the Rashba (Torat ha-bayit [Jerusalem, 1963], 5: 6), and it is doubtful whether the passage against rotehin was in the texts that the Tosafists used. See carefully the printed Tosafot and Tosefot R. 'Elhanan (Husiatyn, 1901), ad loc., s.v. RXo'p. This observation together with the one in the previous footnote points out a lacuna in the current discussion of the problem of mahadurot. No doubt the first step is to scour medieval literature to find citations of tinx DTQIn' or nMnK nvirnn of Rashi and to compare them with the printed text or manuscripts. This alone, however, is inadequate. Only by a close study of the literature of Rashi's school, where his shifts in position are reported, can we ascertain whether other variants in manuscripts or differing citations of Rashi by other medieval scholars are ac- tually instances of other mahadurot, though not called so explicitly. 21. Of the seven manuscripts cited by Blondheim (above, n. 9), p. LIV, six were available to 162</page><page sequence="11">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? report Rashi as printed, as do the recently published Tosafot of R. Judah of Paris.22 The latter are doubly problematic. These Tosafot were written in the beit midrash of Ri under his own instruction, as was common in the Middle Ages.23 This fact joined with R. Isaac's letter leads us to the impossible con- clusion that Ri cited one text when teaching, another when writing. The solution is a simple one. Riban's commentary was not an indepen- dent work, but one written "before Rashi," under his dictation or tutelage (a"f'n ' nr -'."T tIy [ 1"D "ln r).24 From a literary point of view, the commen- tary is Riban's; halakhically it is Rashi's. It contains Rashi's views, and it is his authority that gives the work weight. Making halakhic pronouncements, both Ri and MS Paris Alliance could justly quote Riban's commentary and attribute them to Rashi, for it was the latter who spoke in the work. Any doubts regarding this matter are laid to rest by the opening remarks of the Alliance manuscript-y-:x: *tv 1pi 155S1 15xs D':y;n ;n3w-which, as we shall soon see, is a practical halakhic ruling taken directly from Riban's work, which none can suspect of having appeared in Rashi's commentary. The task of an editor is completed. He may publish the standard text of Rashi confident that it is the correct one; though with a chastened awareness of the dangers of making literary attributions on the basis of halakhic state- ments. But the historian's problems have just begun. Why should Rashi have written one interpretation and yet dictated another? 5) Further on in his responsum, Ri cites another passage from Riban which provides us with a clue. 3K p3 11 nx, m;~1 p mpD mu Dm1 .D 13 " 'I1y lVw'5 ~,nnnwi 1~'0 'n ,m3~n :n3 ,n73nn am; n;nnmb nmbn ['-] Sbx .10r3 1" nVY3 xv nvI15 n* 3 nxDn ;n 1 lx: ,n,,a: 1nln7vY 'm.

If so the contemporary tub (cuve) in which the grapes are trod- den and which possesses no spigot to let the juice out is legally a npipD n n;r'i. Motion and flow do take place (if only as a result of the pressure from the treading), but there is no flow away from the pulp, no separation of liquid from solid. Wine in the cuve is therefore not subject to y.n. Universal custom however treats it as such. And Rashi chose to hold his peace out of deference to the minhag 'avot. This decision for silence was in character with Rashi's retiring nature. While he could if necessary battle for his convictions,26 there was in him nothing of that imperious urge which so dominated his grandson, R. Jacob Tam, to bend his surroundings to his convictions. But here the silence reflected deeper forces. It arose, as we shall see, from an uncertainty on Rashi's part as to the claims of theoretical analysis vis-a-vis those of custom, the accumulated wisdom of the generations. And this hesitancy and am- bivalence left its mark on his work. He was willing to have others, indeed, saw to it that others reported in his name the principle of separation, provided that they also added that he did not intend by this doctrine to alter the current injunctive practice. But in his own writings he refused to chal- lenge overtly or even impugn the ancient tradition. He explained hamshakhah as pnnnn nt5 p5yn wrt t3 xl;lt n;vlY without the key words of D'm3Yn n3 mDntv, an interpretation which would imply separation to one already familiar with the idea, but which would be taken by the uninitiated as simply clarifying how the flow ordinarily occurred. Indeed Rashi's words were read in Germany for close to a century without anyone dreaming of the revolutionary doctrine that they harbored.27 Logically the posture he as- sumed was, of course, inconsistent, but psychologically the ambivalence was comprehensible, especially in view of the remarkable emotional force that the traditional injunction had, as we shall see, for Ashkenazic Jewry. Rashi's position could be interpreted as the result of extreme caution, but later evidence will, I hope, show just how long and how deeply he wrestled with himself as to the truth claims of minhag 'avot. The general injunctive custom referred to by Riban explains R. Meir's original inquiry. He too sensed that the principle of hamshakhah was one of separation, but if this was so then the contemporary practice of viewing the juice in the cuve as subject to y.n. made no sense. Lacking any commentarial 26. E.g., Teshuvot Rashi, nos. 59-62, 81, 382. 27. See text, sec. 12, end. 164</page><page sequence="13">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? aids he began to question whether he had not misunderstood the Talmud. (Presumption was always in favor of custom.28) And so he dispatched an in- quiry to Rashi requesting an explanation of the wine instruments mentioned in the Talmud (gat, bor, gargutni) and whether the decision indeed lay, as one would naturally assume, with R. Huna. Sensing the thrust of the ques- tion, Rashi replied diplomatically. He declined to formulate any critique of regnant practice. Rather he explained as requested the utensils mentioned in the Mishnah, assured his son-in-law that R. Huna's dictum was binding, and then added that as far the juice in the cuves Il'nlm [!] An*on 'D 1'5Y I" ta, confident that R. Meir would catch the critique coded into the formulation. Rashi's position in the responsum is one with that enunciated by the Riban-with one significant difference. At the time of R. Meir's inquiry, he had not yet done any commentarial work on 'Avodah Zarah (see above, sec. 2), and so he declined to confide his criticism even to his inner circle. When dictating to Riban at a later stage in his career, Rashi was clearly more con- fident as to his opinions and was willing to have his views brought to public attention, though his feelings were divided as to his own role in their promulgation. The stages of Rashi's commentarial activity now demand our attention. Before committing ourselves to an interpretation positing ambivalence which led Rashi to a logically inconsistent public posture, we should explore the simpler alternative: that the responsum and Riban's work record an early phase in Rashi's thought, and that his commentary (without ;nmtw ',3yn p3) sets forth a later one. The two reports simply reflect a shift in posi- tion. 6) Fragments of R. Samuel b. Meir's commentary on 'Avodah Zarah have come down to us. And on the topic of hamshakhah it runs thus:29 .rw·a npiptD n aD1 .t]3x ]" n,Y r Wty l nninw 1' n xznn 31i1 nplln- nxwnr no5n pr inin '315K ,nDx "0 1 tY Kw3 jwi -n11 ,T-"w '3 1 Tw rK(l) mnnlm rD,11 1Kxv TP' (1K) Kxi- KxK 'lnxK nlDllm 13x5 0w -'D nr x51 n o^K 115 -in* nr1 ilKl 1vr rt n A1ma Tnn15 , x5n ri,nvn:2 n3na riit Ityn nx 13 annw ntn ,on pin ix1 ;Y npx llau .

This last sentence of Rashbam will be explained below, text, sec. 7. 165</page><page sequence="14">HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK Rashbam's work no less than Riban's was written under Rashi's direc- tion. Indeed a comparison with the passage of Riban cited above (sec. 5) shows that R. Samuel's work is simply an emended version of his uncle's (Riban's) commentary.3' Taking the unquestioned existence of two mahadurot of Rashi's work on 'Avodah Zarah together with Riban's and Rashbam's composition, we may conjecture the following pattern of Rashi's literary activity. Returning home from the Rhineland and academies, Rashi begins his great commentarial synthesis. 'Avodah Zarah, a crucial tractate, is without any serious commentary whatsoever, and from his first scanning of the material he finds himself at variance with common practice and popular in- terpretation. New however to his labors, and without accomplishment in the particular topics of the tractate, he absolutely refuses to voice any criticism of regnant ideas even to his own pupils and family. Time passes and Rashi's activity begins to encompass 'Avodah Zarah. He may have begun with a rough basic draft analogous to his work on 'Arvei pesahim,32 or he may have bided his time until the full commentary crystallized in his mind and then set it down with his usual brevity and clarity.33 Rashi continues with his protean labors and, aware that in 'Avodah Zarah he had begun from scratch, he restudies his commentary and finds to his satisfaction that there is little to correct. He decides that the time has come to provide his people with a vade mecum for this central tractate, so that they may possess for the first time 31. This is a pattern which repeats itself in Rashbam's lesser writings. See our remarks in the Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 28-29 (1972): 242, n. 63 and the material from 'Eruvin cited by Epstein (above, n. 16), pp. 185-86 should be read in this light. See also E. E. Urbach, "Mi-toratam shel bakhmei 'Angliyah mi-lifenei ha-gerush," Tiferet le- Yisra'el, Sefer ha-yovel li-khevod Y. Brodie (London, 1967), p. 28. In our case, so mechanical was the copying that Rashbam did not realize that he had switched the terms for cuve in mid-paragraph (from gigit to guma) and, more seriously, had been led into stylistic obscurity. His addendum should not have come at the end, for then the section beginning mnli 13* rKWv DS seems to be explaining innr,' KS1 T1D'K K when actually it re- fers to why Rashi is ,rni'n ,nhn (see below, sec.7, beginning). Had Rashbam been writing freely the passage would have run thus: '1mnnr' nhin K5K min t1 Kh 7D'K K't mrI5 nn ' 'K 1,'r:W 1z 1mn 5Y1 '1i D'RnK rnlll 1 n 'KW ''L* l3'rJt':w zAun. 32. I personally have found inconclusive the objections to the authenticity of the commen- tary on 'Arvei pesahim. If the reader differs, he should feel free to strike this sentence from the text. 33. It is indicative of Rashi's genius that there is no unevenness in his commentary on this tractate, nor does he give any indication of this being a pioneer effort, just as no difference can be detected in Maimonides' writings between the sections on Sefer zera'im which he hammered out by Herculean labors, and those in Sefer mishpatim where he built on the work of others. 166</page><page sequence="15">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? both an extensive commentary and a practical guide based on talmudic sources instead of having to rely on the traditional rules of thumb in use up to then. The Spartan literary discipline which he had imposed on himself prevents him from doing this in his own work. So he calls his son-in-law and pupil, R. Judah b. Nathan (Riban), and dictates to him a three-tiered com- mentary of exegesis, halakhic decision (pesaq) and practical application.34 Time passes. More and more tractates fall conquest to Rashi's exegetical skills, and he returns once more to 'Avodah Zarah and revises it here and there. The changes are important but few. Finally, toward the close of his life, he decides to give that tractate a final review and update the expanded version that he had dictated to Riban. He calls his grandson, Samuel, tells him to take up his uncle's commentary and together they revise it. The picture we have drawn is speculative and the specific sequence cer- tainly conjectural, but this much seems certain: Rashi dictating to his grandson a revision of his son-in-law's work, itself but an expanded version of his own, is a scene which occurred quite late in his life. This fact taken together with the responsum he had written to R. Meir before he had under- taken any literary activity allows us to say that from the earliest period in his career until its close Rashi was of the opinion that the principle of hamshakhah was one of separation. Yet he ever declined to enunciate it in his own oeuvre!35 7) Not caution but reverence for traditions of his fathers dictated Rashi's position. For throughout his life he sought to understand, or at the very least, to find some rationale for the ancient injunctive practice. Success 34. In light of my remarks in n. 31, I have taken the liberty of transferring the structure of Rashbam's commentary to the work of Riban. Too little of Riban's commentary has survived to establish its structure independently, though our specific citation corresponds to the three- storied structure of Rashbam. Since Rashbam's work was a revised edition of Riban, it is no wonder that it displaced the latter. (A few more citations of Riban are to be found in Tosefot hakhmei 'Angliyah 'al Niddah, 'Avodah Zarah [Jerusalem, 1971]. Rashbam's commentary on 'A vodah Zarah is cited in extenso in the 'Or zaru'a and a sizable fragment was discovered by Abraham Epstein and published in 'Osar tov, Magazinfuir die Wissenschaft des Judenthums 14 [1887]: 1-10. Large fragments of this work are also to be found in MS Mantua Comunita Israelitica 30 ranged around the text of Alfasi. This voluminous manuscript is unfortunately unpaginated. Our tractate, 'Avodah Zarah, is found some fifty-five pages before the end.) 35. If one should insist contra Epstein and Frankel that the mahadurah qamma of Rashi was considerably different from the final commentary (see above, n. 17), and further argue (as 1 never would) that since R. Jonathan of Lunel in other tractates incorporated Rashi's earlier mahadurah into his work, his remarks in 'Avodah Zarah, ad loc. (see below, n. 90) should be taken as being those of Rashi, then the word "ever" should be struck from our formulation in the text above. Rashi initially articulated the doctrine of separation, then thought better of it, excised it and maintained this silence to the end. 167</page><page sequence="16">HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK finally crowned his efforts, and he instructed his grandson, R. Samuel, to make note of it. And Rashbam wrote:36 i3R'K:1 1i3r'Tw m l rnnn5 nrln :»n 5:K n pn ' 31 1KW pvi rtnln K1m anK nllan 135 '? 'E Inrn 5l lno 'K?

Since wine was left in the vats (as if it were a barrel) for some length of time to acquire color and body,37 it was viewed by his predecessors as fall- ing within the pale of y.n., even without separation from the pulp. In other words, if one viewed the tubs as treading floors (as Rashi had hitherto done), then indeed no "wine" had come into existence. If, however, one looked upon the cuves as barrels, as vessels of storage, the juice contained therein came within the injunctive orbit of y.n. If barrels are the controlling consideration, the halakhic front is shifting from hamshakhah to mi-she- yeshalleh be-haviyyot. Rashi's interpretation could exist on two premises only. The doctrine of the early tannaim, it will be recalled,38 had been that grape juice took on the name of wine only when already in the wine pit or in the barrels. In the wine pit a process known as qippui was required; in the barrel one described as shillui. The first premise of Rashi's conjecture must be that the doctrines of qippui and shillui were not actually rejected by the later tannaim when they cited hamshakhah in the wine press as the moment of entrance into the class of wine; rather, they had simply advanced that moment. The old definition was still binding, though it would rarely be invoked, since the wine would ordinarily have become subject to y.n. long before, by virtue of the hamshakhah on the treading floor. If, however, the first stage were to be skipped, the old ruling would proceed to subject the wine to y.n. The second assumption was that the doctrine of shillui be-baviyyot did not embody any principle of separation. Shillui means drawing off, drawing up, or removing of one thing from the midst of another. It could refer either to the drawing up of the wine in barrels from the pit, or to the removal of impurities from the body of wine. In his commentary on a passage in the tractate Bava MeSi'a, identical with the one found in 'Avodah Zarah, Rashi specifically interpreted shillui as 36. 'Or zaru'a, sec. 213 and see above, n. 31. 37.

Yet in his commentary on our passage in 'Avodah Zarah, he defined shillui simply as the introduction of the wine into the barrels: n1an ;z I;,n n,vwn tr5,D nx r lwn" na" twn m pl nrn: mInr5! Significantly, most commen- tators, predecessors and successors alike, whether of Spanish, Italian or Franco-German provenance,4' concurred with Rashi's other interpretation of shillui as separation. His interpretation of the process which takes place in the wine pit, qippui ba-bor, was similarly colored. ;nsp may indicate the hardening42 or the forma- tion of a floating upper crust,43 or, it may be used privatively to denote its removal.44 In the passage in Bava Mesi'a, identical with that in 'Avodah Zarah, Rashi interpreted the term in the latter fashion:45 )itp,a .nDp'a3 wttmr r,a i'mtt r ooin mnr;15 nn, m na; n 5? trl nnn. Indeed the remark there of the Talmud when discussing qippui, "he that draws it [up] is the one who does the qippui," clearly indicates that qippah is a transitive verb in- dicating an action performed by a person, rather than an intransitive process on the part of the wine. Rashi moreover states that the surfacing referred to takes place during the process of fermentation, some time after the entrance of the liquid into the wine pit. In 'Avodah Zarah, however, he writes on the identical passage, and again he stands almost alone among 39. 92b s.v. n;lrwn (printed text corroborated by MSS British Library Or. 73; Add. 27, 196; Jewish Theological Seminary, Rabbinica 833; Bodley Opp. 387; Vatican 131; Cambridge Add. 478). 40. 14b s.v. n;l (corroborated by MSS Sassoon 517; Munich 216; Parma 808; Frankfurt 8' 158; Bodley Opp. Add. 4' 23; Jewish Theological Seminary, Rabbinica 808; 840; Parma 1299).

Thus the mixed juice is brought within the injunctive domain of y.n. briefly after its introduction into any vessel, precisely as regnant custom had it. Rashi's general interpretation would have yielded a unified interpreta- tion of the sugyah: hamshakhah, qippui, and shillui are all stages in the process of purification. The controversy among the tannaim is, as it were, intramural: which stage of separation marks the advent of "wine"? In our sugyah in 'Avodah Zarah Rashi realizes the implications of his insights and systematically eliminates the notion of separation in each and every term. Caution might have led Rashi to muffle his doctrine of hamshakhah, but it could never have induced him to misinterpret the Talmud, to distort his lifework, to compromise his artistic integrity. Only a profound conviction that minhag 'avot (or this minhag at least) was one manifestation of truth and that a proper reading of the Talmud must allow for47 the accommodation of this truth could have led Rashi to redefine qippui and shillui and to code into his oeuvre a potential vindication of ancient custom. The fact that Rashi is not alone in his comments, that Maimonides in his work on the Mishnah understood qippui after the manner of Rashi and that the 'Arukh adduces a similar explanation of shillui,48 shows that Rashi's remarks were.lexically sound and contextually valid. And any lingering doubts are laid to rest by the fact that Rashi's comments passed 800 years of intensive scrutiny without question or comment.49 Yet a careful reconstruc- tion of the literature of his school shows his writings to be equally a vindica- 46. Only Me'iri(Beit ha-behirah [Jerusalem, 1965], p. 202) explainsqippui thus. Maimonides in the first mahadurah of his Perush ha-mishnayot printed in the standard edition of the Talmud, interprets qippui as floating, as does R. Nahshon Gaon in Teshuvot ge'onim qadmonim, fol. 40a. However, the surfacing they refer to takes place after the fermentation has begun. Rabad (op. cit., p. 152) explains it as the settling of the lees, which even in the warmest climate takes place some time after Rashi's qippui. 47. Though not necessarily oblige. 48. Lexically, that is. For qippui, see above, n. 46, for shillui, see 'Arukh, s.v. nDp IV. Shillui is explained not as separation but as transfer from barrel to barrel. This occurs after qippui which, according to the'Arukh, is separation. Doctrinally then there is no relation between this explanation and that of Rashi; lexically they are one. Me'iri adopts Rashi's explanation of qip- pui in toto. 49. In the course of close to a millennium, several scholars did note in passing some of these contradictions, i.e., R. Solomon Algazi, Lehem setarim (Venice, 1664), 'Avodah Zarah, ad loc.; R. Solomon Luria, Hokhmat Shelomoh, Bava Mesi'a, ad loc.; R. Moses Sofer, IHiddushei Hatam Sofer (New York, 1957), Bava Mesi'a, ad loc.; R. Samuel Strashun (in Rom Talmud), 'Avodah Zarah, ad loc. They made, however, no ado about them. 170</page><page sequence="19">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? tion of contemporary mores. Rashi's commentary, like all great works of art, is multileveled in meaning. It here moves simultaneously on the plane of timeless commentary and on that of contemporary reference. It has the dimension of objective clarification and that of a defense of the traditions of the world from which he came. Rashi in the matter of hamshakhah is both an immortal commentator and a faithful son of the pre-Crusade Ashkenazic community. To all appearances no work seems less tinctured with the character and attitudes of the author than that of Rashi. More than any other figure of the Middle Ages he resembles Keats' poet, in that he seems "to have no self, to have no identity but to be constantly informing and filling another body." The historian contemplating his oeuvre, which baffles all search for per- sonality and posture, knows the despair that Schiller spoke of in his en- counter with the classics. "Wholly unconfiding [the classical poet] flees the heart that seeks him .... The object possesses him utterly.... Like a Deity behind this universe, he stands behind his work.. . . Misled as I was through acquaintance with modern poets to seek at once the poet in the work, . I could not bear that in this instance the poet could nowhere be seized and would nowhere abide my question."50 Yet unless we succeed in "seizing the poet," in perceiving the personal in the objective, unless we uncover the polysemy of the work which forms a watershed in Jewish history, seeing its contemporary import alongside of its permanent meaning, we shall never truly understand Rashi or fathom his greatness or begin to write the history of halakhah. * * * The practical implications of Rashi's interpretation were considerable. Grapes upon harvest were placed in cylindrical baskets (hotes) which were strapped to the backs, carried to the cuve and emptied into it. When the vat was filled and closely packed, the treading began and the liquid was emitted via a spigot near the base of the vat. Only then was the pulp taken to a press for the last drop of wine to be extracted. If the spigot remained closed, no separation of wine from pulp would oc- cur, and the entire first phase of wine production would be released from the injunctive domain of y.n. In other words, so long as the crushed grapes 50. Cited in M. H.

Non-Jewish labor could be employed without qualm, and wine transported and stored without the onerous requirements of special and double seals. Vineyards that might previously have been left untended because of the impossibility of Jewish supervision could now be cultivated and harvested.52 Jews could contract wine from Gentiles, requesting only that it be delivered in a mixed state. Jewish communities were generally tiny, averaging from a handful to a score of families and tended (in the county of Champagne) to make their own wine. As the crude state of barrel making made the ageing of wine and its long-range storage impossible,53 wine was usually produced anew every fall. An entire year's consumption had to be provided for in the treading of September and early October, but since the High Holidays and Sukkot fell in these months, the time available for grape pressing was limited indeed. In contrast, the quantities of wine consumed in this age was (as we have already noted) enormous, and it was taxing in the extreme to tread so large a quantity in so short a time with so little manpower. It is difficult to see how this was accomplished without the concerted effort of the entire com- munity.54 The use of non-Jewish help in the treading and the possibility of 51. See above, n. 37. 52. Suggested by Ma'asei ge'onim, p. 81. This would have allowed them to make full use not only of their own distant vineyards but also those offered in mortgage to them. 53. M. W.

The average Champagne household in the month of September very much resembled our own before Passover. The second passage usually cited in support of Rashi's supposed oc- cupation (Ha-'oreh, p. 214, Teshuvot, no. 159) refers most probably to R. Isaac b. Judah. In the literature of his school Rashi is never called hn'un i3'2, but the former scholar is regularly refer- red to this way by the Makhirites in the Ma'asei ge'onim. Indeed the presumption is against anyone being a winegrower in Troyes. Its chalky soil to this day is inhospitable to viticulture, and not surprisingly Elizabeth Chapin has found no references to vines in local documents (Les villes des foires de Champagne des origines au debut du XVIe siecle [Paris, 1937], pp. 97-98. Contrast this with their frequent mention in the Bar-sur-Aube region, ibid., pp. 77-92.). A generation or so before Rashi there seems to have been one solitary owner or, perhaps, more accurately, only one major owner of vineyards among the Jews of Troyes (Teshuvot R. Me'ir mi-Rotenburg [Budapest, 1895], no. 941 and note ad loc.). Undoubtedly there were some local vines, probably for private use (Rashi's words almost imply as much), but that they should 172</page><page sequence="21">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? contracting wine deliveries constituted an enormous lightening of the load. The ruling would have been a boon to any age, but it was particularly ad- vantageous in the waning years of the eleventh and early years of the twelfth century as the Jewish community began its retreat from landowning55 and its control over wine production became progressively more difficult. An allowance such as this cannot long be suppressed. If Rashi rendered tacit obedience to those customs in which he had been raised and whose validity had been unquestioned in the academies where he had studied, these held no sway over the minds of the young scholars who had gathered around him, whose thinking he had shaped and whose halakhic world was his teachings. Rashi's reservations were primarily emotional and these stand little chance of survival when opposed by both logic and convenience. Law by its nature tends to adopt articulated positions and discount personal hesitations. His pupils dutifully noted his reservations but themselves joined, apparently, in promulgating the doctrine which freed wide tracts of wine production from all restraints.56 8) The next development is the appearance of the doctrine of R. Jacob Tam (henceforth R.T.). Ri reports:57 ]Wvv 'lnn[vn "' ,n", -i . .. . .

Hamshakhah according to R.T. is not the downward flow of the juice on the pressing floor, but the flow of the juice out of that place. The unique category of "wine" came into existence only when the liquid left the press. While on the trading floor, it remained ever "grape juice" (mashqin ha-yoSe'in). Only when removed from its place of origin could it assume the independent category of "wine." This was no academic doctrine. Care would have to be taken, according to Rashi's interpretation, that no pulp was ever pushed to the side or scooped out to make for easier treading, for then hamshakhah would take have regularly produced a surplus sufficient to afford a living is asking a great deal of them. Despite all this, Rashi may nevertheless have been a vintner; but by the same measure he may have been an egg salesman. 55.

Doubts naturally arise as to just how feasible such control was. It is easier at times to observe a blanket injunction than to confine an allowance within a framework of onerous precautionary measures. R.T.'s doctrine swept away the need for any such measures. So long as the wine remained in the cuve where it was initially trodden, it was totally immune to any injunction. The question presenting itself immediately is, What was the relationship of this doctrine to the felt needs of the time? The bearing of halakhah toward reality-the patterns of resistance and response, of attentiveness and indifference-is a complex one and forms too large a topic to be treated here. For the moment let me say that nothing could be farther from the mind of any religious person, not to speak of a man of the Middle Ages, than an attempt of set purpose to align a divine norm with temporal needs.59 Response, when it came, flowed from a conjunction of a distinctive com- munal self-image with certain premises of the dialectical method, and as often as not halakhah turned a deaf ear to common need. But under certain specific conditions, circumstances did play a role (if only mediately) in the birth of ideas, and the question which arises is whether R.T.'s doctrine of hamshakhah was an instance of this. Every case is of course unique, but two criteria can be mentioned. The first is temperament; is such an awareness in character with the propounder of the doctrine. Some scholars are oblivious of reality, others well aware of it. The second is an uncharacteristic flaw, and I emphasize the word un- characteristic. Is there some defect in the doctrine that leads one to infer that unless something impinged, wittingly or not, upon the mind of the author, he would not have arrived at what he did? The criterion of character is in most cases circular. We know next to nothing about the temperament of most halakhists. Fortunately this is not the case with R.T. His intense awareness of his people's needs and his boldness in thought and action are well documented.60 Rabyah (R. Eliezer ben Joel of Mainz, d. ca. 1225) leveled against R.T.'s doctrine of hamshakhah a critique from the Tosefta.6' But this proves nothing. Even the 58.

More damning is the well-nigh univer- sal stricture that hamshakhah simply does not mean "pouring" in mishnaic Hebrew; "pouring" is called mn*,p, or in our case ni1n rrrv.62 Had R. Huna wished to express what R.T. claimed he did, he should simply have said n1in nn r,nnnnwn. Hamshakhah refers invariably to a flow across a surface as Rashi had explained it. Few men in the Middle Ages had a finer lexical sense than R.T., and it is difficult to see his explanation other than as an at- tempt, conscious or unconscious (and subject to the restrictions we outlined elsewhere), to ratify general practice and to insulate much of Jewish wine production from any religious proscription.63 Such may be our conclusion-if R.T.'s pupils understood him properly. R. Jacob's own words have not come down to us. Our knowledge of his position comes from reports of the Tosafists, and they, inspired primarily by the formulation of R. Judah of Paris who wrote his Tosafot at the feet of R. Isaac of Dampierre (no mean source!), speak uniformly of mn*,p, and by so doing exposed the doctrine to withering lexical criticism. It is an even chance, however, that R. Jacob of Rameru was imperfectly understood. Wine in Talmudic times did not pour out of a press into a pit. The press was built on one level, the pit on a lower one and a pipe connected the two. In a letter which we shall presently discuss,64 though unfortunately not one in masekhet 'Avodah Zarah [Bene Brak, 1976]), cited in 'Or zaru'a, sec. 214; "Sefer 'Amarkal," Le-David $evi, David Hoffmann Festschrift (Berlin, 1914), p. 13. 62.

The only medieval scholar known to me to endorse R.T.'s position is Ri (Tosefot R. Yehudah mi-Paris, loc. cit.), but his position was influenced by the difficulties he encountered in explaining mDn5 lmin rp 5tun of the Mishnah (see his responsum cited above, n. 10). There is no evidence that R.T.,was motivated by this consideration. 63. Haym Soloveitchik, "The Tosafist Conception of Law."

The exit of the liquid from the press did not then entail pouring, but a downward motion across the inner surface of the pipe, precisely as demanded by the term hamshakhah. R. Jacob's pupils in- advertently formulated his doctrine in terms of medieval realia and thus came to speak of mnl,p.65 The flaw may be in the tosafist transmission rather than in R.T.'s initial position and one of our two criteria (for detection of in- fluence) has not been met. One could contend that despite the ap- propriateness of the term hamshakhah, R.T.'s interpretation was still too ap- posite to contemporary need to be wholly fortuitous. This may well be, but there is no way of proving it, for one lacks the crucial angle of deflection that is necessary for any demonstration that extraneous factors were im- pinging upon the course of immanent developments. In brief, if no breakdown occurred in tosafist communication, if no mis- understanding arose in the central yeshivah of Dampierre, R.T.'s interpreta- tion bears the imprint of contemporary challenges. If such a misunder- standing did indeed arise and R.T.'s doctrine is actually lexically sound, there is no way then of evaluating its genesis, other than by personal intui- tion. It would be wisest, perhaps, to eschew such divination in the initial phase of halakhic historiography and to adhere as closely as possible to the criterion of "measurable deflection," if we wish to avoid the pitfalls of a simplistic sociology of law. Let us lay the foundations of Jewish legal history with insights possessing some measure of certainty and only then fill in the interstices with impressions. Only after the halakhic terrain has been charted with some certainty, and skills acquired and intuitions tested in the course of that arduous mapping, should we then venture into the territory of conjec- ture and surmise. Be that as it may, R.T.'s allowances were after all but the capping stone of Rashi's. What of that initial revolutionary doctrine? Was it a product of the felt needs of the time? Recall Rashi's guarded language in his early responsum to R. Meir, his protracted silence, his excision of the words D:,a:Yn n i:n:w and his novel explanations of qippui and shillui. If ever a man sought to hide his discovery it was Rashi. What emerges is the picture of a great commentator arriving, on this occasion as on hundreds of others, at the precise nuance of a term. Perceiving the consequences of the downward 65. It will not do to argue that n7p can also mean motion across a surface as in Zevahim 25b.

And then he stopped dead in his tracks! It was his pupils whose halakhic world was his teachings and who felt no deference to a Rhineland where they had never studied, who promulgated the new creed-one which the people rapidly and profitably embraced. The accep- tance of this major innovation, almost revolution, in y.n. and its refinement by later hands is attributable to circumstance, its inception is not. The initial breakthrough was here an immanent development. And lest anyone attempt to generalize, let me add that in the next case the situation could be the reverse and the one after that altogether different. Be that as it may, the joint doctrine of Rashi-R.T. liberated much of the production, transportation and storage of wine from the injunctive do- main of y.n. Small wonder that the old injunctive custom was swept away! The new doctrine won such wide acceptance in the Champagne that by the last quarter of the twelfth century, the great R. Isaac of Dampierre (Ri) neither knew nor had even heard of the original custom, and added that in R.T.'s day the allowance was equally universal.66 9) But we are anticipating. Our printed Tosafot reports in the name of R.

Judah the evaluation o,u;n ,)yn in xirX1 is not found and Ri too, in a report that we shall soon consider, omits this assessment.68 The problem is both textual (what is the correct reading in the Tosafot of R. Judah?) and historical (is the report a later evaluation or an actual description of the motivation of the participants?). Y.n. had long been considered a classic example of insolentia Judaeorum. One of the earliest anti-Jewish (possibly antisemitic) tracts written in the Middle Ages, that of Agobard of Lyons, mentions with bitterness that Gen- tile touch defiled liquids and made them unfit for Jewish consumption. From privilegia granting to the Jews the right to sell their wine, one can see 66. Teshuvot Maharah 'Or Zaru'a, no. 174, fol. 59a. 67. Tosafot, ad loc., s.v. vux, end; Semag, injunction 148.

No less a person than Innocent III lashed out at this presumptuous- ness.69 Whether the specific merchants mentioned by R. Judah were motivated by the desire "to find favor in Gentile eyes" or not, is not really important; that y.n. engendered disfavor is. And this is the point of significance. Gentile good will was needed by all; y.n. was an omnipresent ir- ritant and everyone had much to gain by its allowance. Any evaluation of developments in y.n. must take into account the high price in Christian bit- terness that Jews were willing to pay for this injunction. Too often our atten- tion focuses on the allowances made, forgetting that these were "ad hoc" al- leviations within an injunctive framework, and that that framework was maintained despite its contributing to and acerbating antisemitism-which in this period translated itself rapidly into persecution. Occasion presented itself to the Tosafists to wipe y.n. from the books, and it was rejected with shock.70 Spanish Jewry, for example, were lax in their observance of this in- junction, and attempts were made to rid themselves of this annoying restraint.7' I have found, however, no evidence for any of this in France or Germany. The Ashkenazic community was animated by a fierce sense of the heroic in the face of persecution and intensely felt their dissimilarity to the heathen world around them. Y.n. seemed to them an appropriate symbol of this distinctiveness, and they did not begrudge the price they had to pay for it. The people's identification with the injunction and their pain-filled and costly efforts to maintain it go a long way in explaining, psychologically, the inclination of the halakhists to alleviate points of particular stress. 10) In his responsum, Ri provides us with further details of the story:72 69.

Shemaryah of Spires wrote the actual letter.73 The letter was sharp enough to put R.T. on the defensive. And writing thus to R. Jacob Tam was no sim- ple matter. The spirit of talmudic dialectics which had been dormant (in any significant fashion) since the fifth century had sprung to life again in R. Jacob Tam, and in him and through him the halakhah embarked upon a new period of massive creativity. He was working a revolution and he knew it; and through him flowed the imperious sense of bringing a freshly wrested vision of truth to the world. His contemporaries (even his critics) sensed this, and their relationship to him was not one simply of respect or reverence, but of awe-awe before the unforseeable and the unique. Fear of his intellectual thunderbolts and the force of his leonine personality often made timid men of those who had dealings with him. A report of another encounter of R.T. with R. Shemaryah has come down to us, and from it we may hazard a guess that when the time had come for Germany to register a protest in Rameru, the choice of R. Shemaryah was not wholly accidental. R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a relates:74 '"i nnin pnxr Kx pEnolezer be .N n anD t.Sa n an lfar surpassed h ItX hs n n nsugsted that yi-T rrm Uf* , nv nu3nn *1 isn -Tw Urip12 Kxt5 nU v15 51in Tn p Dew 5tT n o3irn muv11 .T5"Y lni mn- rn13 13-In ni:rn .[5ll ?] (11515) xUvn 1zr KbUJ 1K ,15 t8n IImt w mn KxitU Ylnr 5in 1* 1w15 - in- Inalp nx ny15 pn 77z 5nl plwuz y v 7tnum i 1»in nx Dn Inn 5nil .n511351 5113, ITLnr y1 v1n* 5: ny rn 3rnW 3por1 . R. Shemaryah was certainly not the greatest German scholar of his time. R. Eliezer ben Nathan and R. Joel far surpassed him. It has been suggested that R. Shemaryah happened to be then passing through Troyes or Rameru, and this is what occasioned the inquiry.75 And indeed had R.T. dispatched a letter to Spires, there would have been an automatic delay of burial for at least a week or so. But even granting R. Shemaryah's presence at the time in the Champagne, the story is still remarkable. First, R. T. was the last man to ask for advice regarding a decision.

The passive role described in 1lr'T nx nl hT'pl is also out of character, especially in view of R. Shemaryah's astounding line of reason. The case at hand involved the suspension of two pentateuchal miSvot, the imperative of ar i3'ipn inap n, mLfn D,nfK n¥-p ,n Kmnn and the injunction of rpn ¥w ln'73 r,n KX. Argument was made from permission granted by the Talmud to open a grave for a mo- ment to ascertain whether the deceased was a minor or not. The nature of the ban on grave opening remains obscure to this day,76 but it is probably not pentateuchal and certainly not even vaguely on a par with the injunction of r5n x'. Opening a grave briefly and leaving the dead unburied are two totally different things, and no one needed to be told of this less than R.T. How he could have accepted such an argument is little less than astonishing. The solution to these problems may lie in an observation of E. E. Ur- bach, who noted that all that we possess of R. Shemaryah are reports of practical rulings-pesaqim.77 Indeed his judicial talents, his ability to chart the appropriate path to the desired decision, displayed themselves even in his student days,78 and his practical orientation earned for him the sobriquet (unique among the Tosafists) of aryn 5y:. R. Shemaryah, in other words, was a poseq not a dialectician, a man who operates with ideas rather than a creator of them. The mind of the poseq does not so much focus on the ultimate implications of an idea (and its coherence with others) as on the op- timum manner of its implementation. More than it examines ideas, it asses- ses their place in a world of men and things. Such an intellect weighs the contending claims of tradition, opinion, and practical effect against the monolithic demands of logic. Balance rather than acuteness distinguishes it. Few contrasts could be greater than that of R. Shemaryah, the practically oriented moreh hora'ah, and R.T. the boldest halakhic iconoclast of the Middle Ages and possibly its greatest revolutionary.79 The two types repre- 76. See J. J.

Objection will immediately be made that R.T. himself was a great poseq. Indeed he was (see above, n. 60), but he was a creative poseq not a manipulative one. He did not balance off multiple factors or seek technical shortcuts to a goal, but forged bold new doctrines and ruled 180</page><page sequence="29">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? sent two principles in any legal system-stability and dynamics, tradition (precedent if you will) and theoretical (shifting) truth, practicality and logic. When personalities clash, the poseq looks upon the dialectician, especially the revolutionary one, as an unsettling element in the system and perhaps even too clever by half, while the theoretician looks down on the moreh hora'ah as a technician and a dullard to boot. When sympathetic relations reign, however, each may see in the other a necessary complement to his own work and call upon him for aid when he feels his own tools unequal to a situation. People in the Middle Ages felt no strong obligation to pay off debts, and even respectable members of the community defaulted without qualms of conscience. It has already been noted in this connection that delaying burial was at the time an accepted form of coercion for liquidation of debts.80 Among Jews, of course, the obligation was clear cut and there was the dic- tum of m;lY n m : nyn,D,8' but waywardness in these matters is often infec- tious. R.T. was apparently confronted with a recalcitrant debtor. (Note the twice redundant phrase r nn"n ;rrnw ylr mr; which occurs in the question and again in R. Shemaryah's reply.82) The question arose whether some new means of constraint could be applied and the common delayal of burial seemed the most effective one at hand. No one knew better than R.T. the seriousness of the injunction involved; yet no one in the Middle Ages was more aware of contemporary forces and needs. Caught between the con- tradictory pulls of logic and the need for pressing action, he turned to a well known poseq and ba'al ma'asim, R. Shemaryah, who happened to be passing through. If this distinguished representative of the Rhinelands would recommend holding up burial, he, R.T., would go along. Working from analogy rather than deduction as jurists (though not dialecticians) do, R. Shemaryah suggested just that and on the basis of the talmudic h1,5. And in the words of 'Or Zaru'a, ri': nK n-'i :1pi. Quite intentionally this ruling was not a product of R.T.'s halakhic initiative, but one in which he purposely chose to play a subsidiary role. on their basis. His greatness in this area stemmed from the fact that his daring and creativity were not confined to theory but overflowed into practice. 80. M. Alon, loc. cit. 81. Ketubbot 86a. 82.

Shemaryah in no less a matter than suspending a biblical in- junction. If the burial story antedated our case of tub treading, the choice of R. Shemaryah was a shrewd one. The imperious genius of Rameru could hardly claw his critic and try to prove him a fool (as he had done to others who dared question his ways), for that would mean that he had relied upon a fool previously. If the case of the debtor occurred after the one of y.n., it speaks doubly of the respect that R. Shemaryah commanded and, inciden- tally, of R.T.'s character. This encounter ended, as we shall see,83 with R.T.'s discomfiture; yet that proud scholar still esteemed his critic enough to turn to him later for guidance. At all events a professional poseq of conven- tional thought was chosen, one who would have to be replied to on his own terms, and upon whom the dialectical thunderbolts of R.T. would be wasted. 11) The text of R. Shemaryah's letter has not come down to us, but we do possess a letter of his to R.

Gentile tub treading is simply inconceivable to them, as is any Gentile contact with the cuve. From his report it would appear that he dispatched two letters to R.T. In the first he challenged the latter's decision on the basis of the possibility of an admixture of y.n. Later he found a passage in the Yerushalmi which sup- ported his position, and dispatched this proof to R.T. This second note went unanswered, at least at the time of his communication to his colleague. 12) R.T.'s reply has been preserved by the 'Or Zaru'a, and as we shall have to make a detailed analysis of it, it is best to cite it at length.85 [X5] rn^";T 10 enxli .5 Xt 5vtt r an 1 TT1 n 5rD 3'3 mn :p IVP 1VY nnfv ' 1rm Vy1 Ixv Iny :31 nloi l1, n n.nwan I,xv ivnin i-inx,n xiin D13mn DOwx5n uY rspD nn trw *11D I'YD3 n9 !n1 ct nn I.In Io3 ll nIl" - o'11 5 v nnn ro ln n 31 : 3 nz5snmr XU'V!l .1TA1 uY Da^Oot Dn '"DnY DR lo nsDD n13?

This clearly is a reply to another letter which R. Shemaryah did not mention to R. Joel. R.T. here answers two charges-first a general one that he was lax in matters of y.n. (T'5n 1isK ninv r s pn h ), second, that French practice controverted R. Huna's ruling of hamshakhah (n5rT nnvw lnsr rin 5 r ni Kl13n rn 5). Clearly this was R. Shemaryah's opening salvo. Only when shown that these practices did not violate an explicit talmudic dictum, did R. Shemaryah advance the second contention-that they ran the danger (wvn) of an admixture. To return to the rebuttal. R.T. feels compelled to emphasize that he, too, is stringent (mahmir) in matters of y.n.

The correction KU is made on the basis of the Mordekhai, sec. 845, and see above, n. 56. 183</page><page sequence="32">HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK can see how deeply the Ashkenazic community felt about y.n. when a suspi- cion of laxity could put even the leonine R.T. on the defensive. Aware, perhaps, of his reputation as a revolutionary,86 R.T. opened by pointing out that the current practice was not his innovation. Behind him, no less than behind R. Shemaryah, stood a tradition (5linw ':n1 "Yb nnbrv i1'1n mrn 1p nTiT ,'n KKn 1 5"r). While the merchants of Metz may have given R.T.'s name as authority and cover, the allowance was not of his making. It would seem, however, that he shaded the story a bit by stating that Rashi instituted (ran;;) the practice. As far as we know (barring a radical change of heart in his last days), Rashi provided the theoretical basis for the allowance but hardly advocated or instituted it. Personal hesitations, however, have no place in law. (The Tosafists, for example, cited Rashbam's report without bringing the tale of Rashi's self-imposed silence.87) Legally Rashi did make the allowance and so pressure of circumstance together with legal outlook allowed R.T. to write as he did and in a sense quite accurately. This is not historical but legal narration. The concept of historical narration, as we con- ceive it, hardly existed at the time, certainly not among halakhists. R. Shemaryah, as we shall soon see, acted after a similar fashion. To our mind this might seem a cloak for personal discomfiture. Perhaps it was, but it was a cloak worn naturally and with a sense of honor. R.T. then turned to the basis of French practice and presented the sugyah of hamshakhah as interpreted in France. Note, however, that he did not set forth his own doctrine of hamshakhah but that of Rashi.88 It may be that at this time his own interpretation had not yet crystallized or his writing here may be an instance of a skillful fusion of tact and legal accuracy. The Germans were mounting a frontal attack on the French practice, and an ef- fective defense demanded a presentation of Rashi's doctrine. R.T.'s own position was, for practical purposes, but a fine point, a further insulation of the wine in the cuve from y.n. Why then complicate the defense, especially since he strove to present a French tradition over and against the injunctive one of the Germans. Having shown how his countrymen's practices were rooted in R. Huna's 86. Note incidentally the concluding remarks of R. Shemaryah (I. A. Agus, op. cit., p. 76). No halakhic discussion follows. This is simply the report of one German rabbi to another of R.T.'s activities as a poseq. In each of these decisions, R.T. was breaking either German tradi- tion or that of his fathers (ir, T1,). See the vociferous German reaction to his ruling that hames was '03o 't in Raban, sec. 10. 87. Tosafot, 55b s.v. ixK. 88. There is no mention of flow out of the press; Tpr rather is made the criterion. 184</page><page sequence="33">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? dictum, R.T. wrote perplexedly to R. Shemaryah n,hr nannw Ins ;nn n5 ; ni 3;1 1'n 75. We may infer from this, as already noted, that R. Shemaryah first challenged R.T. by claiming that French conduct ran counter to R. Huna's ruling. And this is of triple significance. First, the objection makes sense only on the assumption that hamshakhah means flow or liquidity-both of which occur in a closed cuve. Indeed our remarks at the outset of the essay that the Rhineland com- munities interpreted hamshakhah thus (i.e., that the regnant injunctive custom had a theoretical basis) were largely based on R. Shemaryah's query. They were founded also on the fact that in the Sefer ha-pardes (which in the subject of y.n. contains Rhineland rather than French traditions) the dictum of R. Huna is cited without comment.89 If hamshakhah be merely "flow," then R. Huna's remarks are indeed self-evident, for that is simply what the word means; if, however, hamshakhah is but a means to an end and that end is separation, this obviously requires articulation. Eleventh century thought, in other words, is not self-contained, and anything but articulate. While an intensive study of the Pardes, Ma'ase ge'onim and the like is certainly a desideratum, it will rapidly prove inadequate. In our case the existence of an injunctive custom is mentioned nowhere in the literature of the period. Our knowledge comes from a fragment of an eleventh century work (Riban) cited by a twelfth century scholar (Ri) whose writings surfaced in the late thirteenth century (R. Hayyim 'Or Zaru'a). More significantly the theoretical basis for the practice, which served as a starting point for all halakhic developments, can be educed only from an assumption contained in a reconstructed query sent by a scholar of the twelfth century taken together with an earlier commentarial silence. Yet reconstruct the eleventh century we must. For without a knowledge of pre-Crusade thought we shall never fully grasp the activity of Rashi and his school, and much of significance that transpired in Germany in its more famous centuries will go undetected. Second, it is significant that R. Shemaryah omitted telling R. Joel of this first letter. The innate superiority of the principle of separation as the dividing line between wine and grape juice over that of flow or liquidity was apparent to all halakhists. Once promulgated, Rashi's doctrine swept the field entirely and was adopted by all schools whether of French, German, 89. Pardes (Constantinople, 1802), fol. 16a, s.v.

Shemaryah was no exception. His objection, he realized, was groundless and the old Rhine doctrine was now of unproven worth. But why publicize tradition's problematic nature? A responsum is a halakhic communique, not a diary or historical narrative. The substantive parts of the correspondence were the later ones and these he conveyed to R. Joel. The third point that may be inferred from R. Shemaryah's use of R. Huna is that the commentaries of the Rashbam (or Riban) had not yet penetrated Germany to any sizable extent.9' If they had, German scholars would have known full well the basis for the French practice. A generation later, in Rabyah's time, these works were common knowledge. Determina- tion of the date (or period) of a doctrine's diffusion is prejudicial to all ques- tions in the history of halakhah. We tend to assume the influence of an idea to be coextensive with its publication, but little could be farther from the truth. Some fifty to seventy years after their composition neither Riban's work nor that of the Rashbam had penetrated some 150 miles eastward. Rashi's work did reach Germany; Raban used it constantly. Since it is highly doubtful whether the German scholars would have fired off a sharp letter to R.T. without first checking Rashi's comments, one can further see how well Rashi had succeeded (by the elision of three words) in camouflag- ing his revolutionary doctrine.92 13) R.T. concluded his letter with these words: '"oK lntrr 'nrn o:n,5 :x * n55,5n nip1pl nm: iK nr,,.

Anyone familiar with the writings of medieval halakhists knows how rare compliments are. (Rabad too perceived the principle of separation [op. cit., p. 149, s.v. p"?, and Temim de'im, sec. 107], but could not explain as smoothly as Rashi did how this process inevitably occurred on the treading floor. And his successor, R. Jonathan, aban- doned the Provencal explanation for that of Rashi.) 91. R. Joel apparently had sections of either Riban's or Rashbam's commentary which had penetrated Germany anonymously. See his closing remarks (MS Bodley Opp. 66, sec. 1050, Sefer Rabyah (above, n. 61), p. 20: i'lri Do",, .[!] i ,nnS? lnr Om K , I5 nKlm rYm pon D ,nKYDl rnmlA nIDn ,i, n Yx131 r, , n 1 n, ~ 1", m 15,w n, a,x'n vn *,n D= oxKI. The term "gaon," as is well known, was used in thirteenth and fourteenth century Germany for distinguished predecessors, especially of the period before the rise of the Tosafists. But outside of this fragmentary reference there is no evidence of penetration. From Raban's remarks in his work ad loc., it is equally clear that he does not know of any doctrine of separation. 92. Similarly, Raban never elicited this doctrine from Rashi's words (see previous note). 186</page><page sequence="35">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? touch only; it had never, countenanced tub treading.

If wine in the cuve was not subject to y.n., why not have Gentile treading? Indeed when the doctrines of Rashi and R.T. were studied in Spain, scholars there considered this the obvious in- ference.95 Nevertheless the French community declined this allowance, despite the enormous conveniences that it offered! Within less than one month wine had to be made for twelve, and we must remember the quan- tities consumed in the Middle Ages. The use of Gentile labor, not to speak of the possibility of ordering outright trodden cuves, would have lightened the load considerably. Yet throughout the twelfth century, while Jews were being forced out of landholding and wine production was becoming for them ever more difficult, they stubbornly declined to avail themselves of the permissible.

In light of Ri's explicit statement here and elsewhere (ibid., fol. 59c bottom), one should discount the report of R. Judah of Paris in his Tosafot (ad loc.) that R.T. forbade treading because of the mishnah 'aharonah. This was Ri's conjecture as to a possible legal basis for R.T.'s ban. Law, however, dislikes visceral reactions and soon Ri's thoughts were viewed as the reason motivating R.T.'s stand. In some schools though memory of the non-halakhic nature of R.T.'s stand lingered on even after its transformation, and we read in the Semaq Zurich (e.g., MSS British Library Add. 18,684; Parma 172; 583), ad loc.: nmt ' -noxK'? 1 ,iK 'p T jrnpm n"i ynrl1 Mb T '73-;1 5Qx D-i n8 xN-i x5x -r?p xSp n?m "'s -pnnn ywo n et .xron rinv n K nx on 'zs nTu ,n3'lnN 1RK3. 95.

See Torat ha-bayit 5: 2; Hiddushei ha-Rashba 'al 'A vodah Zarah and Hiddushei ha-Ritba, ad loc. It must also be remembered that even Nahmanides' doctrine (and that of Rah) is premised on the as- sumption that hamshakhah can take place on the treading floor. This being so, a precautionary ordinance against Gentile treading makes sense. R.T.'s doctrine, however, ruled out such a pos- sibility and R. Isaac subscribed to it (see above, n. 62). 187</page><page sequence="36">HAYM SOLOVEITCHIK lowances, their desire to uphold at heavy cost even that which could be dis- carded, must be taken into account when time comes to evaluate the posture of the Tosafists toward communal needs. The idea of Gentiles treading Jewish wine awakened revulsion in the Ashkenazic psyche and the anger of R.T. and the language of Ri ('in 'Mnr," m:ml 1 nmo96) only reflected a general repugnance. The roots of this sentiment are difficult to uncover97 (it clearly antedates all literary remains of the community), but one suspects that this aversion played its part in Rashi's stubborn efforts to sustain, or at least understand, minhag 'avot. It was not simply a question of ancient custom. Rashi like any other halakhist took issue, at times, with established practice. But here he realized that his interpretation of hamshakhah allowed Gentile tub treading, and he asked himself in amazement whether it was possible that the religious sensibilities of the entire Ashkenazic community had gone astray. Could so deeply felt an injunction be a figment of the imagination, and had the toll in drudgery and antisemitism all been paid in vain? It was, one suspects, questions like these and the conflicting pull of intellectual certainty that led Rashi into am- biguity. 14) R.T.'s letter, presenting the French position, had its impact. The 96. This phrase should be taken quite literally. There may be an allusion to 'l",nn 1T pnin for the full sentence reads: rrn,n 1iK1 lw'v' D,'V ': ,5N'n' 5' 1" na '1an'P Or nl: nll n131b -n: 1 ...

For if there is a fear of hamshakhah or of 1y' n,rn, Gentile touch should then be forbidden equally, and Ri explicitly permits it. (Indeed treading possibly creates a less serious danger of y.n. than touch, for plm ' rtr KO '7r Tr03 ['Avodah Zarah 56b].) 97. It is possible that the repugnance was heightened by the fact that Gentiles trod barefoot (Friedrich von Bassermann-Jordan, Geschichte des Weinbaus unter besonderer Berucksichtigung der Bayerischen Rheinpfalz [Frankfurt, 1907], 1: 254-56; Moriz Heyne, Funf Bucher deutscher Hausaltertilmer von den altesten geschichtlichen Zeiten bis zum 16 Jahrhundert [Leipzig, 1899-1903], 2: 259-60) while the Jews, as Innocent III already noted, wrapped sheets around their feet (Grayzel, above, n. 69). It would further appear (Bassermann-Jordan, op. cit.) that in the Rhine country even Gentiles did not tread barefoot, but rather beat the grapes with sticks; this might explain the utter shock of German scholars at the French practice. (Note R.T.'s con- cluding remarks to R. Shemaryah, text, sec. 12.) I would add that the Ashkenazic reaction to tub treading shares little in common with that which R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres registered in Temim de'im, sec. 83. In the case under discussion there, the upshot of a certain doctrine would be to destroy a good deal of the raison d'etre of y.n. That is to say, the logical conclusions of a theory are so startling that they cast overwhelming doubts as to the validity of its premise- a common enough mode of reasoning. In Gentile treading, however, no accepted principle of y.n. is endangered, and no premise in turn challenged. The repugnance is self-contained and logically indefensible. I can see no other basis for it other than a religious (and possibly an aesthetic) one. 188</page><page sequence="37">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? parting words of R. Shemaryah to his colleague were m y:i 5pn Kx D"9YKl.98 Note that he did not write 1iK ox in D"i; rather he advises maintaining the old injunctive practice. Rashi's doctrine of separation had an innate per- suasiveness which R. Shemaryah fully realized, and in fact tacitly admitted by his silence regarding his first critical letter to R.T. But the difficulty in ac- cepting an allowance running counter to habit and upbringing, and the in- stincts of a poseq, which insist that time must elapse before even the most plausible new idea proves itself, led R. Shemaryah to counsel holding fast to the traditional ruling. 15) Time passes, and a generation arises that comes into early contact with the theory of separation. It comes as no surprise if, in the works of Rabyah and even in that of R. Eleazar of Worms (who represents a far more conservative school), we find Rashi's doctrine accepted without demur.99 16) And then we read in the Taqqanot Shum (signed by both the above writers) 1T,;1 nT5 r l m rr3, K1 I100 The acceptance of the principle of separation left the ancient prohibition without a leg to stand on, and German merchants in and about 1220 began to draw the same conclusions as had those of Metz some half-century earlier. Lacking any figure of the awesome proportions of R.T., Rhineland scholars fell back on communal ban to shore up faltering custom. Was it successful? We do not know. R.T.'s threat was effective for some time, though by the latter half of the thirteenth cen- tury it had spent its force.'0' It would be an ironic ending to our story if Gentile treading succeeded in establishing itself in Germany before it made headway in France. 17) But tub treading, it will be remembered, was not the only thing R. 98.

Isaac of Corbeil makes no mention of R.T.'s ban or of any injunction against treading in his influential Semaq ([Constantinople, 1509?], sec. 225, in later editions sec. 223). His contemporary R.

This report of French practices, however, is corroborated by R.

The French also left cuves unsupervised in Gen- tile houses, and that exposed them, R. Shemaryah contended, to the danger of Gentiles mixing genuine y.n. in the vat. R.T., as far as we know, brushed this aside.'02 Then R. Shemaryah came across the passage in the Yerushalmi which prohibited wine (even if still mixed with the pulp) that had been left, unsupervised, with non-Jews and dispatched this objection to R.T. At the time of his communique to R. Joel, R. Shemaryah had no reply from R.T. But it would seem that an answer was finally forthcoming, and that in it R.T. admitted that his critic was in the right. And this is the evidence for our last statement: After reproducing the critique leveled by Rabyah against R.T.'s understanding of hamshakhah, the author of the Sefer 'Amarkal (a pupil of R. Asher) concludes with the fol- lowing statement:'03 I1K * ,'Tlnrn nI'mv "'i'm 1 'nn1 *r "' 11 ; n" n mnlwn"1 KX3m nrw;n. If this report is taken at face value we must postulate three more let- ters. First, after he had taken care not to present his own doctrine of hamshakhah, R.T. changed his mind for some reason and informed R. Shemaryah of his position.'04 R. Shemaryah then anticipated Rabyah's proofs from the Tosefta and wrote of them to R.T. and finally received another letter from R.T. admitting the cogency of the objections. The old warning against multiplying entities beyond necessity comes immediately to mind. The entire discussion, moreover, was irrelevant to the issue at hand. The French practice could do quite well on the basis of Rashi's doctrine alone. Aptowitzer has already noted that 'A markal is not to be relied on,'05 so we need never infer such heavy communication between Spires and Rameru. Inaccurate the author of 'Amarkal may be, but he is not a liar. He 102. In the century-long discussion by the French Tosafists of the Yerushalmi (see below, n. 117) no mention is made of the fear of admixture (with the exception of Tosefot R. Yehudah mi-Paris, under the special circumstances that y.n. is adjacent and would ordinarily be added). Their entire discussion revolves around the fear of hamshakhah. R.T.'s rejection was probably based on the fact that the Mishnah ruled that n;umi n, npL7. If R. Judah Ha-Nasi feared not an admixture, it would be gratuitous on the part of others to fear it. See also 'Avodah Zarah 12a and the discussion in the 'Or zaru'a, ad loc. The German school, i.e., Roqeah (sec. 492) and Rabyah (sec. 1069) interpreted the fear of the Yerushalmi as being one of admixture. In other words, the instinctive apprehensions to which R. Shemaryah gave voice in the first letter became the interpretational basis of the second. 103. Op. cit. (above, n. 61), p. 13. 104. Or if R.T. only later arrived at his doctrine of hamshakhah (see text, sec. 12, middle), then we must assume that he hastened to inform R. Shemaryah that France was moving yet one more step toward leniency. 105. Victor Aptowitzer, Mavo le-sefer Rabyah (Jerusalem, 1938), p. 152. 190</page><page sequence="39">CAN HALAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? had heard some report of a retraction by R.T. in matters of hamshakhah and naturally assumed it to be a retreat by that scholar from his own doctrine. On this basis alone, I would hesitate to state that R.T. actually conceded, but there is a difficult passage in the Mordekhai which now claims our atten- tion. After citing R.T.'s letter to R. Shemaryah defending the French position (above, sec. 12), R. Mordecai wrote'06 1 nr,man , nr n"1 oV ,'nxtK ',1i nma. If the juxtaposition be taken seriously the note could mean one of two things, both equally difficult. The new equation of gigit and gat may be referring to the opening remarks of R.T., n,r,n 1",, na nnmn m, tv, which would mean that R.T. subsequently abandoned not only his own but also Rashi's analysis of hamshakhah, even though no cogent criticism had been leveled against the latter. Or it may be referring to his closing remarks (as found in the printed text) about basket carrying and the beating of grapes with sticks: T1t m K,1;11 , 'n q'1;1 DP ',sprD 1X nK r' n 5'?x nrK : T'l,rn1 13K nrnm 5pnn DQ'3Y;1n *iv1 15"K iK. The trouble with this reading is that in R.T.'s time grapes were never brought to a press but to the cuve,107 and so there was nothing to be stringent about. In the 'Or Zaru'a the passage runs thus: rnnm ": ,'n,nn 13Kx. Its correctness is evident: this is a reply to the charge men- tioned by R.T. in his opening: ,5,Pt 13KUi nv nDw 7n 5y.

The average person could hardly afford to build a winepress, even if he lived in an area where the right of press was not one of the lord's banalites. I have been unable to find one manuscript illumina- tion or frieze from the Middle Ages showing contemporary treading in any other place than in a cuve. (I say contemporary treading, for an illustration of a biblical verse where a winepress is mentioned would, not surprisingly, portray a winepress.) See J. C.

Why R.T. should have had a change of heart on the matter is incomprehensible. There is, furthermore, a puzzling lack of uniformity in R. Mordecai's note. The printed text reads xKm 'Inn - "nin ,ll.

R. Mordecai, we know, did not live to complete his work. His students, upon his martyrdom, rounded it out from his notes."0 R. Mordecai, I suggest, came across a report of R.T.'s retraction and made a note of it"' alongside of his following discussion of the Yerushalmi for future reference and expan- sions which, tragically, never came. And copyists acted as copyists do with glosses. Some omitted it altogether, others quoted it cautiously as a a'VIDK ', and some simply incorporated it into the text. It was the students and copyists, unaware of the meaning of the cryptic note, who appended it, quite naturally, to the preceding letter of R.T. (in which gat and gigit are manifestly contrasted and R.T. explicitly mentioned) rather than to the fragmentary discussion of , y nn5y; for which it was originally intended. What the words na r: n ra,' l,rnn vwv meant was that R.T. anticipated (and not for the first time)"2 later attempts by the Tosafists to distinguish between gat and gigit and thus neutralize the Yerushalmi."3 He rejected them and said that the Yerushalmi's ruling applied equally to the contem- porary cuve. It was this that he communicated to R. Shemaryah, and it was the printers of the 1598 Cracow edition of the Mordekhai. (Our printed 'Or zaru'a is an accurate transcription of MS British Library Or. 2860, fol. 62vb.) 109. MSS Hungarian National Museum at Budapest 2° 1; Vienna Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek 73; British Library Add. 19,972; Hechal Shelomoh 5 have it in the first person, the citations from the Mordekhai in the commentary ranged around the Blondheim Alfasi (above, n. 21) have x"'n, while the passage is missing entirely in MSS Sassoon 534, Cambridge Add. 490.1, Hechal Shelomoh 4. 110.

In MS Hechal Shelomoh 5 it actually appears as a gloss in the margin, though this could have arisen simply from a scribe who having skipped it in his initial transcription then proceeded to add it to the margin. 112. A close study of the Sefer ha-yashar will show just how much of subsequent tosafist thinking R.T. anticipated. The printed Tosafot do not reflect the protean nature of R.T.'s thought. 113. Below, n. 117. 192</page><page sequence="41">CAN HA,LAKHIC TEXTS TALK HISTORY? echoes of this concession that were picked up by the author of the 'A markal some hundred and fifty years later. R.T.'s conduct here may perhaps serve as a useful reminder of the measure of inner conviction that a thinker demands before he sets forth a doctrine which, to our eyes, appears (and may in a sense ultimately be) a justification of the status quo. If the reports of the Tosafists are accurate,"14 R.T. would interpret hamshakhah as pouring, but he would not distinguish between a winepress and a cuve. To our minds the reverse might seem more reasonable. Hamshakhah as pouring ran contrary to the basic use of mish- naic Hebrew, a distinction between gat and gigit ran contrary to nothing. It was always a legal possibility. But to R.T. things appeared differently, and the fact that the equation of cuve with the press condemned French practices could not move him to assent to a doctrine of which he was not convinced. 18) But if he could not subscribe to the vindication of contemporary practice, neither would he proclaim its guilt. It will be noted that French sources knew nothing of his retraction and even Germany had but the barest notion of it. R.T., I suspect, delayed his reply until the tumult subsided and then, out of intellectual honesty, sent a quiet note to R. Shemaryah"5 con- ceding the point but made no mention of the matter to his pupils. Ever the realist, he knew that the authority of a Yerushalmi could not roll back long entrenched forms of Jewish wine production, and he saw no need to proclaim to his people, struggling at high cost to uphold y.n., the problematic nature of their conduct. 19) But the Yerushalmi passage was discovered independently in France. The aged R. Joseph Porath came across it and showed it to Ri."6 The emergence of the text simultaneously in both countries indicates that its sur- facing was more than coincidental. It was a hallmark of the broadening of the halakhic horizons of the twelfth century, which confronted the previous- ly insulated Ashkenazic community with a wealth of new material, the con- tents of which did not always concur with common practice. And upon the 114. See text, sec. 8, middle. 115. If someone insists that R.T. was no longer alive at the time of the correspondence (see above, n. 84), he may either discount our reconstruction or assume that R.T. quietly notified someone, but not R. Shemaryah, of his retraction, and reports of this note were picked up by late thirteenth century editors. (I suspect that the word 'omn, above, n. 106, should be read nlmna, i.e., in a gloss, and should not be understood as a reference to any of the famed novellae of the French academies. No one in France, to the best of my knowledge, was aware of R.T.'s retraction.) 116.

While uniformly recom- mending taking precautionary measures, all the Tosafists nevertheless did their utmost to defend established practice."17 This phenomenon of vindica- tion repeats itself again and again in their discussion of y.n. and of other contemporary problems. A proper understanding of it is essential to any evaluation of the mentality of the Tosafists and of the relationship of their thought to the world around them. But it is too large a topic to be treated here. 20) The Yerushalmi posed problems in France, but it only bolstered tradition in Germany. Thanks to it and to the strong stand taken by the rab- binic authorities, Germany continued to abstain from leaving vats unsuper- vised with Gentiles well into the early years of the thirteenth century. Or so it would seem from Rabyah. He wrote:"8 1npy nxK XV ' KD5; KV Kximn pI xn " '11 7n1=3y n pl TnP* T71O T" 'OyU '5n113T 1 ,;K'5^ lpXip [rnvii] (n3=3z) i*15 i'71X Snnn , vyna l'ry nx Xir' Dt53ft DK 5:X 13na "'3 "'K 103 T" nlynL rvin tp W" "MnM Tn p mUiy nl'rl Tnpl5 n srx rlK 42»a KWylns T" nsy KX'xK , XrnnTn KX51 n?nVn n ''l7 n T'' n Pn T 1poF '? 1K ' 1 tXn?

Note too the shift in argument that has occurred. The ancient ban knew nothing of the Yerushalmi (remember R. Shemaryah's words ,wv'1n: 'nxra:v ' ), but was rooted in R. Huna's dictum and included not only unsupervised storage, but Gentile touch and tub treading as well. Yet within one genera- tion (from R. Shemaryah's note to R. Joel to the work of the latter's son, Rabyah) the old injunction was transformed, and the Rhineland interpreta- tion of hamshakhah simply evaporated. Only somewhat less remarkable than the retentive capacity of a traditional society is its ability to forget at times what it must. It then innocently pours new content into old forms and renews their mandate. 21) Rabyah's pupil, R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a, treats at length the problem of hamshakhah, and that discussion, like Gaul, may be divided into three parts.'19 He opens with a full citation of Rashbam's commentary on 117.

'Avodah Zarah (cited above, sec. 6), then quotes in extenso the critique that Rabyah directed against R.T.'s doctrine of hamshakhah and concludes with the latter's reply to R. Shemaryah defending French practices. There is nothing new in what he says, but of great significance is his silence. No men- tion is made of the Yerushalmi. Indeed he copies the text of Rabyah up to the passage cited above-and then stops. There is no reference to the injunc- tive tradition of Germany or to the problematic French custom. This pat- tern repeats itself many times over in the 'Or zaru'a. Rabyah and R. Eleazar of Worms (Roqeah) represent a German tradition. R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a belongs as much to France as to Germany. There is a great deal of Ger- manic material in that work, but it is not a work of Germanic tradition. From the days of R.T. and Ri French influences press hard on the Rhineland culture and in the second quarter of the thirteenth century suc- ceed in overwhelming it. R. Meir of Rothenburg is intellectually no more German than French and the same holds true for R. Mordecai. As for R. Asher (Rosh), who would know of the achievements of Raban and Rabyah if he took his instruction from the Pisqei ha-Rosh? There is far more of Spain and Provence in that work than there is of his homeland. Germany as a dis- tinct halakhic culture ceases to exist somewhere after the year 1230,120 and the disappearance of the old injunctive tradition from the pages of the 'Or zaru'a is just an example of this general dissolution. If R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a, R. Meir of Rothenburg and their successors one and all did not think the ancient ban worthy of mention,'2 it is difficult to see how the ordinary businessman could feel himself much bound by it. We have every reason to assume that now, like his French compatriots, he too left his cuves unsupervised. France and Germany melded into one halakhic community and as the awesome figure of R.T. receded into memory and the emotional bias against 120. Intellectually that is. Distinctive practices and customs continue for quite a while. 121. R. Meir of Rothenburg, the Tashbe5 and the Haggahot Maimoniyyot make no mention of the matter altogether, while R. Asher (ad loc.) adopts the French position. R. Mordecai cites Rabyah's fears of admixture alongside the French allowance and makes no mention of the ancient injunctive custom. (The first sign of the weakening may be found in Roqeah, sec. 492, if our printed text is correct. It is corroborated by the one extant manuscript of the Roqeah, MS Bibliotheque Nationale 363, fol. 188r. One would much prefer better support, since this is a late fifteenth century copy and closely related to the manuscript from which the Roqeah was published. Personally, I suspect that a gloss has crept into the text. I should add that if the text is authentic, our case is not typical. The Roqeah generally is a very conservative work and free of substantive French influences.
