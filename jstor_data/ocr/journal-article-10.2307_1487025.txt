Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1990. 499 pp. Toward the end of this wide-ranging collection of essays Eugene B. Borowitz comments on the importance of showing "people how to under- stand one another in their difference" (p. 403). Despite disagreements about Borowitz's characterizations of Judaism and modernity, or his specific moral recommendations, few can deny his honest confrontation with oppos-</page><page sequence="2">116 BOOK REVIEWS ing positions and his refusal to reduce them either to a caricature or a mirror of his own views. Thus, for example, he respects the integrity of traditional Judaism and acknowledges where he must depart from halakhic norms. Discussing ques- tions of marriage and divorce he makes no claim to perform halakhically valid marriages. Instead, he declares, that "to me Jewish authenticity arises from a Jew's continuing personal appropriation of the people of Israel's Covenant with God, not in following specific juridic procedures by which Jews in prior ages and today have sought to express it" (p. 390). This state- ment reaffirms the dialectic between individual autonomy and acceptance of the directives of Jewish religion that characterizes this book. Borowitz emphasizes the lived tension between these two sources of decision making and in his central chapters characterizes the person who lives such a life as "the ideal Jew" and the "mentsch" (chaps. 17, 18). The book as a whole exemplifies this dialectical ethics based on a modern theology, informed by cogent analysis of Jewish ethical theories and applied to specific moral questions (Borowitz considers the terms "moral" and "ethical" to overlap [p. 12]; I, personally, however, still find it useful to distinguish the two: ethics is the system by which a person derives individual decisions; morals refer to those decisions.) Borowitz grounds his ethical system in a general understanding of Jewish ethics and a specific interpreta- tion of modern Jewish history. The book offers a superb summary of Jewish ethical theorizing (the introductory section offers definitional essays that should become standard in courses on Jewish ethics, and the later chapters include sections on Hermann Cohen, Leo Baeck, and Ahad Ha'am) as a basis for what follows. More particularly, however, Borowitz takes modern Jewish experience as a foundation of his ethics. Much of his writing describes the community of which he is a part. He offers a perceptive analysis of contemporary American Jewry, a sketch of what such Jews demand of Judaism and why they have rejected much of the liberalism dominant in an earlier period. Theologically, however, he roots that earlier liberalism in a revelatory experience: the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment initiated Jews into a world of pluralism which recognizes the limitations of all human knowledge and a world of rights and duties in which parochial communities must con- verse with one another. He calls this experience "reminiscent in its own lesser way of the great revelatory exodus of our people from Egypt" (p. 303). The practical implication of seeing experience as revelatory lies in taking</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 117 the realities of the community within which one stands as in some sense binding. If Jews cannot give up autonomy, then they should not. Jewish unwillingness to sacrifice ethnic identity reveals an ethical imperative. More specifically, Borowitz's interesting variety of response to apparently similar questions of sexual morality can be traced to his emphasis on communal experience. Since the Jewish community demands equality for women, tra- ditional laws must be changed. The laws discriminating against women "cannot be explained away by any form of mitigating defense" (p. 189). Since, however, that same community finds the family imaged by homo- sexuals deeply offensive, Borowitz recommends against ordaining them as rabbis, even while suggesting the "workable" if "far less desirable" alterna- tive of having homosexuals enter a rabbinic program and "come out of the closet" only after ordination. He declares that "my view of our Jewish reli- gious obligations in this area" underlies his dissent from the more liberal permissiveness (p. 284). These two decisions reflect his view that "autonomy should not be subservient to the halakhah in sexual matters but at the same time, the law, in all its details, does not hesitate to make its claim on the committed autonomous Jewish self" (p. 184). Those legal claims appear most powerful, however, when Borowitz advocates Jewish ethics as a corrective to American social mores. Here he relies most heavily on the Jewish will to distinctiveness. Thus he opposes even the teaching about religion by the public schools because "I believe that in contemporary America the most authentic and useful thing Judaism can do is to reassert its distance from the state" (p. 134). His discussion of business ethics emphasizes the distinctiveness of Jewish "metaethics" and calls for a renewed effort to sanctify everyday life. He relies for such an effort on the sense of shame Judaism cultivates. He concludes that "we will again have no significantly effective business ethics until we once again learn to feel shame for our business immoralities" (p. 352). This collection of essays helps achieve that goal. Through engaging readers so that they emphathize with the author, this book engenders the affective as well as the rational basis of ethics that Borowitz celebrates. The enduring value of this book lies in its evocation of a modern Jew struggling with the various commitments and challenges provoked by today's world. S.
