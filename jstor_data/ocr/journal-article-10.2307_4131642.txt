Yehoshua's growing eminence as one of Israel's foremost literary artists has been attended by his emergence as one of the more powerful voices of the secular Zionist left. A highly self-aware writer, Yehoshua has been scrupu- lously deliberate in separating the intellectual pragmatism of his political writing from the imaginative structures and aesthetic integrity of his literary works. But the generic distinction between polemical essay and imaginative fiction does not preclude overlapping areas of concern as well as a common basis of values and beliefs. Consequently, Yehoshua's essays often prove to be useful means of enhancing the understanding of his fictional works. In his essays, Yehoshua expresses a consistent concern with the impact of Jewish history on the present contours of Israeli identity. This concern is also central to Yehoshua's masterful novel Mr. Mani (1990), which Gershon Shaked, the dean of Israeli literary historians, rightfully regards not only as Yehoshua's most important accomplishment so far but also as "one of the most important lit- erary accomplishments of modern Hebrew fiction in general."' The range of inter- secting individual and national issues that Mr Mani engages is very broad. This essay will focus more narrowly on the novel's narrative efforts to discern, critique, and ultimately, transform the manner in which traditional notions of Jewish terri- torial affinity affect Israeli perceptions of the national and territorial prerogatives of the Arabs who inhabit the Land of Israel. This thematic inclination is already evident in Yehoshua's early works, such as "Facing the Forests" (1968) and The Lover (1977).2 Although it is more fully engaged in Mr. Mani, this aspect of the novel has received little critical attention.3 1.

As the novel proceeds, it becomes increasingly evident that this predilec- tion is related to the pathological heritage of self-destruction that Yehoshua perceives in the Jewish people's history of seeking to retain their identity as a nation while resisting the responsibilities of independent national existence within distinctly defined territorial boundaries.4 The radical perception that emerges from Mr. Mani is that salient aspects of the Zionist effort to shift the center of Jewish existence from Diaspora to Zion constitute a contemporary trans- mutation of the Diasporic conviction that the continuing cohesion of the Jewish people is not predicated on their adherence to particular territorial and communal bounds. The surface structure of Mr. Mani, which consists of five conversations, each between two different people, is unusual in at least two respects. In each conversa- tion, only the words of one speaker are heard; the words of the other must be inferred. Moreover, the conversations progress in regressive order: Each one is succeeded by a conversation that precedes it by several decades, moving the nar- rative backward in time.5 All of the speakers in these one-sided conversations are highly accomplished storytellers who aim for very specific narrative effects. Their inversely ordered stories are placed on a carefully calibrated historical continuum that constitutes a structural mainstay for the articulation of the novel's major themes. The first and most contemporary section of Mr Mani takes place in 1982, in the midst of the war that Israel was conducting in Lebanon. The speaker in this conversation is a young woman, Hagar Shiloh, who is talking to her mother, Ya'el, at kibbutz Mash'abei Sadeh, of which they are both members. Hagar, whose lover is Efi Mani and who believes she is now pregnant, is trying to tell Ya'el the story of her visit with Efi's father, Gavriel Mani, in Jerusalem and her repeated efforts to prevent him from committing suicide. Yehoshua began writing Mr. Mani during the Lebanon War. For him, this war was a watershed, 4. This concern was first fully and famously articulated in Yehoshua's essay, "Hagolah- hapitaron hanevroti," in A. B. Yehoshua, Bizkhut hanormaliut (Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1980), 29-73, translated by Arnold Schwartz as Between Right and Right (New York: Doubleday, 1981), 21-74. It continues to inform many of his subsequent essays-most recently, his highly controversial "Nisayon lezihui vehavanah shel tashtiot ha'antishemiut," 'Alpayim 28 (2005): 11-30. 5. This regressive structure, which mimics the dynamics of psychoanalysis, combined with Yehoshua's effectiveness in creating compelling psychological contexts for his characters' actions, has fostered a significant body of critical writing that regards the interest of this novel as primarily psychological. See, for example, Nitza Ben-Dov, "Ha'omnam kav yashar vetiv'i lepalestina?" in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 164-75; Avi Gil, "Gevulot metushtashim," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 224-29; Avidov Lipsker, "Mah nishtakah mehamanim ubemah nizkar A.

Both Hagar and her mother seem to take this as a matter of course. Neither expresses any concern about the war or about Efi's personal safety. In his conversations with Hagar, Efi's father displays a similar lack of involvement or apprehension. Reaction to the Lebanon War is evident only in one brief scene. Having been rebuffed in her first effort to communicate with Gavriel Mani, Hagar walks around his pres- tigious Jerusalem neighborhood, trying to work up the nerve for a second attempt. Along the way, she passes by the house of the prime minister: And there was a little tent pitched in front of it, covered with posters protesting the Lebanon War, and this one couple was huddled inside, wrapped in a big blanket, hiding from the cold. And on the other side there was an abandoned table, apparently from a counter-demonstration, with a sign that was already torn. I kept on walking.7 This muted suggestion that emotional disengagement from the war and moral oblivion to its consequences is not a peculiarity of these three characters but a general social phenomenon is an early intimation of one of the novel's major themes. What is merely intimated in the novel's first section is reiterated with jarring force in its second section. This conversation takes place in August 1944 on the island of Crete. The speaker is Egon Bruner, a young German officer, who is trying to explain to his adoptive grandmother, Andrea Sauchon, why he chose to remain in occupied Crete rather than continue on with his original unit to the battles of the eastern front. A series of correspondences introduced in the opening movement of this section link Egon Bruner to Efi Mani. Both are slender young men with poor eyesight and an interest in the humanities8 who respond reluctantly to the call to military duty. Both are trained as medics, and both lose their glasses and are forced to perform their military duties with impaired vision.9 It is the similarity of these duties that is most striking, for both Egon and Efi are soldiers in occupied territories. This nexus consolidates the implication that 6. Bernard Horn, Facing the Fires: Conversations with A. B. Yehoshua (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997), 111. 7. A. B.

In many important ways, the second section of Mr Mani is an extended exploration of the consequences of Israel's transformation into a nation of conquerors with an evolving culture of occupation. Like Efi, Egon starts out as a reluctant warrior. Born into a distinguished military family, he is a bookish, introspective young man who, because of his near-sightedness, was trained as a medic after he was drafted. However, through the intervention of his well-connected, fiercely nationalistic, and relentlessly militaristic grandmother, Andrea, Egon was transferred to an elite airborne div- ision and made part of a special force that parachuted into Crete and suffered great losses during the German invasion of the island. Egon considers himself a humanist and an idealist1o whose capacity for independent thought distinguishes him from the vast mass of fellow soldiers, who obey their orders thoughtlessly and with violent efficiency. The story that Egon tells Andrea is his way of attempt- ing to resolve an internal conflict that is constantly pitting his country's present ethnocentric militarism against a heritage of humanistic idealism. Underlying Egon's story is an increasingly evident palimpsest of figures of speech and patterns of thought that tie the fictional conflicts it contains to the ten- sions and contradictions between Zionist myth, Zionist ideology, and the present practices of Israeli society. The novel's second section tracks the internal intrica- cies of Egon's transformation from a dreamy idealist and aspiring humanist to a hardened destroyer of property and lives who is still wracked with shame and with guilt and who still dreams of ultimate national redemption. Egon sees himself as the standard bearer of a revolutionary ideology, destined to rid his benighted nation of its debilitating afflictions by transporting its people to a mythic Mediterranean homeland and creating a vigorous new society there. But in his ruthless dedication to the pursuit of this dream, he relinquishes his heritage of humanistic idealism, diminishes his capacity for human compassion, and adopts a morally abhorrent ethos of ethnocentric militarism. The irony here is as terrible as it is telling. Refusing to become a sacrificial victim of a retrograde national credo, Egon embraces an alternative ideology of national redemption that trans- forms him into a willing sacrificer of others. Egon's initial aspiration for national transformation coincides closely with the fundaments of the Zionist dream. Both are idealistic visions of a national renewal that require casting off the heritage of a despised past and draw on tropes of an ancient Mediterranean culture to evoke the redemption that will occur upon the nation's return to a mythic land of origin. Like the early Zionists, Egon clings "to the stirring belief that perhaps here a new gate will open for the nation and for the individual" (134, 131). With them, he shares a vision that ima- gines the emergence of a "new man," (101, 95) and justifies the use of violent force and the readiness for ultimate sacrifice in reclaiming the land that is needed to realize these ideals. "So I decided," says Egon, speaking of Crete, "that this is the place worthy of fighting for and dying for" (101, 95). The dangers and contradictions inherent in such a vision begin to emerge soon after 10. Yehoshua, Mar Mani, 107, 102. 170</page><page sequence="5">Borderline Cases Egon arrives on the island, and they become increasingly evident during his ensuing stay. He discovers the intrinsic incompatibility of lofty humanistic ideals with the grim imperatives of conquest and occupation. He also experiences the human toll that occupation inflicts not only on the occupied but on the occu- piers as well. Upon encountering members of the Mani family, who are living on Crete at the time, Egon experiences his first taste of what he will later come to call [T]hat sweet and sour dish called Conqueror's Fear from which we eat until it makes us sick. This is the cause of the anxiety and the dread that emanate from each one of us, even when he is walking along innocently, absorbed in the loft- iest and most humane thoughts. This is the reason for the careful attention that each of our soldiers gives to every move he makes, even when he begins to loath himself. (110, 105) This sense of self-loathing is compounded by Egon's growing awareness of the atrocities that are being committed in the name of German supremacy. In his revul- sion and despair, he comes to regard the Nazi officers who come to tour Crete's Minoan ruins as "certified monsters, master murderers, geniuses of destruction. the vicious scum of the German race" (133, 131). Yet one of the ironies that define Egon's story and generate much of its meaning is that, in a very profound sense, he is not unlike these men. It gradually becomes apparent that underlying and undermining Egon's resolutely proclaimed humanism and earnest moral questing is a profound aversion to those who would contaminate the purity of the regenerated culture of his dreams. Despite his contempt for and rage against his heritage of exclusion- ary nationalistic aggression, Egon is still very much a product of this culture, and he is still very eager to please his grandmother, who so forcefully represents it. At first, he befriends the Manis. But when he discovers they are Jews, he responds with bitter disappointment. "Jews," he thinks. "Really? Even here? Even on this unique and wondrous island? Between the sea and the sun? Among the vestiges of a prehistoric culture? Do they want to precede us once again? How did they get here in the first place?" (121, 117). The reason Egon gives for this immutable antagonism of German to Jew is laden with overtones of the conflict between Israelis and Arabs. These correspondences infuse his character with a distinct sym- bolic dimension. They channel the ideological and emotional cross-currents that clash within him toward a reexamination of the encounter between the founda- tional Zionist myths of national regeneration and the realities of another nation that already inhabits the space in which this mythic redemption is to take place. Egon explains that he was compelled to hand the Manis over to the authorities "because it is not possible for us to purify ourselves in the ancient womb of our ancestors if damned Jews were already running around in it and, with their usual insolence, demanding a partnership even here, even in our own myth" (124, 120; emphasis in the original). Using the character of a racist Nazi to examine the dangers to Israeli human- ism, idealism, and moral integrity posed by an ethos of exclusionary nationalism, 171</page><page sequence="6">Gilead Morahg rampant will to power, and dependence on military subjugation is a deliberately unsettling move. It is designed to shatter the kind of complacency that is evident in the detachment of the characters in the novel's first section from the war their country is conducting in Lebanon and to provoke a moral awareness of the consequences of any military occupation, both for those who are its victims and for a society that condones and conducts such an occupation. Although he is adamant that the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories cannot be equated with conditions under Nazi occupation, Yehoshua is equally insistent on the moral legitimacy and artistic validity of drawing on the Jewish experience during World War II to illuminate some of the more troubling aspects of the Israeli experience in the aftermath of its own wars. The emotional resonance that the Holocaust experience carries for Israelis makes its images and memories particularly effective means of evoking the realities and measuring the morality of their own actions as an occupying nation. "In our collective and personal subconscious," he explains, [L]ike it or not, we carry not the images of the French in Algeria or the English in Kenya but rather images of the Second World War (and let us not forget that the Holocaust was not just the gas chambers but also a horrifying system of humiliation and mistreatment of individuals, old people, women and chil- dren). These are the fundamental images with which we have been raised and which are planted deep in our souls.1' The projection of a profoundly Israeli problematic onto the actions and inter- actions of two German nationalists at the time of World War II constitutes an associative formation that both familiarizes and exacerbates the provocative critique that the second section of Mr Mani advances. Determined to stay on the island of his dreams, Egon manages to evade being sent to the eastern front by volunteering for the German secret police unit charged with tracking down undesirables. Since then, he tells Andrea, I have entered uninvited into many homes, overturning beds, throwing open closets, pulling out drawers, and shredding mattresses with my bayonet. I learned very quickly that in order to retain my sanity, I had to do away with all civility. This means that, the minute I burst through the door, I have to cast the blame on the people whose house I was invading. Not to ask permission or to apologize, but to immediately start going through the rooms with commanding authority and with a violent rage against the very existence of closets and drawers and dressers and even the walls between the rooms. (125, 121-22) The association of Egon's psychological and moral transformation with the experiences reported by the soldiers charged with policing the Israeli occupation 11.

Yehoshua], Newsweek, October 17, 1988, 64. 172</page><page sequence="7">Borderline Cases is soon extended to the broader consequences of these activities and the growing awareness of their inexorable futility: Suddenly we are alone. And the more we are isolated, the more we are hated.... So we keep rounding up haters and imprisoning them and interrogat- ing them to give up more haters, over and over again. That's how we spend our days. We come back from guarding installations and are assigned to counting prisoners. We come back from a chase (mirdaf), and go out on a search. Then there's another interrogation that leads to another search and another chase until, at midnight, at the changing of the guard, we discover that instead of decreasing our isolation, we have increased it; that we have become captive to the masses we imprisoned. (134, 131-32) Within the metaphoric matrix it creates-with its recurrent allusions to the Lebanon incursion, the domination of another nation, and the occupation of the land in which its people dwell-the novel's second section demonstrates the devastating consequences of extending the life of a nation beyond the territorial boundaries that define its singularity and imposing its presence on the unwilling population of another nation. The relationship of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and to the people of another nation who also inhabit this land figures, with shifting areas of emphasis and from varied points of view, in four of the novel's five sections. The novel's fourth section, though forcefully exploring the pathological causes and catastrophic consequences of the Diasporic negation of the essential connec- tion between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel, does not engage the import of this negation on the attitudes of Israeli Jews toward the Arabs of the land. Consequently, this section only indirectly reflects on the argument of this essay, and so I will defer my discussion of it to a more relevant context.12 12. One of the critical commonplaces concerning Mr. Mani is that it is preoccupied with ques- tions of Sephardic identity and that it provides a counternarrative to prevailing versions of Zionist dis- course by engaging Jewish history from a Sephardic point of view. This is puzzling because, with one significant exception, the Sephardic characters have little voice and no independent existence in this novel. The little there is of their speech is reported speech, and their inner worlds are reconstructed or invented by others who are often profoundly alien to them. The narrative perspective in the first four sections belongs to a sequence of explicitly non-Sephardic narrators who are appropriating the Mani story to serve their own needs. It is not surprising that in these narratives, the Manis do not come to embody much that is typical or representative of the Sephardic community and its culture. This also explains the paucity of knowledge about what most of the Mani men actually think or feel. For views of Mr Mani as a novel that thematizes the Sephardic experience, see, for example, Arnold Band, "Arkhi'ologiyah shel hona'ah 'azmit," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 183; Alan Mintz, Translating Israel (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2001), 178-79; Dan Miron, "Me'ahorei kol mahshavah mistateret mahshavah 'aheret," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 61, 68; Gershon Shaked, "Shorashim," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 132-37; and Shaked, Hasiporet ha 'ivrit 1880-1980, 5:169-70. On the other hand, Yael Feldman concludes that the Manis are far from being a representative Sephardic family and that it is impossible to maintain that the Mani perspec- tive constitutes a hidden Sephardic critique of European Zionist ideology. See Feldman, "Behazarah leber'eshit," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 208, 209. From a very different perspective, Avraham 173</page><page sequence="8">Gilead Morahg In the novel's culminating fifth section, the concern with the relationship of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and to the Arabs who inhabit it is evident in the tension between Avraham, the rigidly conservative patriarch of the Mani family, and Yosef, his iconoclastic son. This tension is configured as a manifes- tation of the contradiction between the national and religious systems that Yehoshua regards as the cause of a deep-rooted anomaly in the Jewish people. "On the one hand," he says, "there is the normal national system functioning in accordance with the basic needs of national existence in a territory, and, on the other hand, there is the religious system, which sets spiritual goals for the people and tries to subordinate the people's existence to religious and spiritual demands."13 Yehoshua believes that the religious system has always had a position of dis- proportionate power in Jewish culture and that its constant conflict with the national system constitutes a continuous hazard to the unity of the nation. He has repeatedly argued that the historical Jewish solution to this existential threat was to construct a culture of perpetual Diasporic existence.'4 He regards tra- ditional Judaism as a system of faith that is willing to take unacceptable risks to sustain its paradoxical notion of a Diasporic nation that insists on a distinct identity within the social, political, and cultural fabric of other nations that are equally insistent on their own distinct identities. And, he argues, a "total conception that says that we can stay a people while not in our land, that we can maintain our iden- tity while not in our land," is a tragic existential folly: "There always were warn- ings, all through history, that this will end in catastrophe. And it ended in catastrophe."'5 In Mr. Mani, Yehoshua suggests that this cultural determinant, which created conditions that made the Holocaust possible, continues to persist in the post-Holocaust era of Jewish statehood. The novel points to an Israeli society whose actions are still powerfully shaped by a conviction about its ability to sustain an existence within the social tissues of other nations. It reflects a concern that the consequences of this conviction may, once again, be morally and historically catastrophic. In the fifth section of Mr. Mani, this internal danger is represented in the con- flict between Avraham Mani's dedication to a universal Jewish faith, which is pre- sented as being inherently Diasporic, and the aspiration of his son, Yosef, to a mode of national existence that is essentially territorial. Yosef disavows traditional notions of Jewish nationhood and dedicates himself to transforming his nation by uniting its people around the territory they inhabit. He wishes to fuse all the inhabitants of the land into a single national body that is founded on a native Balaban also concludes that the Sephardic experience is not thematized in Mr Mani.

He is appalled that his son is prepared to disavow the primacy of universal Jewish soli- darity in favor of forging a distinctively local national identity. And he disparages Yosef s position as a desperate and dangerously inauthentic construct fashioned to cope with the acute sense of loneliness and alienation he experiences in what, for him, is a profoundly foreign land. The father attributes his son's radical ideas to the general influence of the ideals of the European Enlightenment and to the particular influence of Yosef s employer, the British consul, who is driven by a redemptive vision of breaching the barriers of nationality, culture, and faith and integrating the disparate commu- nities of Jerusalem into a single, cohesive social whole. This consul is devoted to "that special confection that is his passion. Firmly and expertly kneading together all the faiths, languages, nations and races and baking them pitilessly in the desert fire into a single Jerusalemite loaf' (312, 329). But Yosef's notion of an integra- tive, territory-based identity is morally undermined by an obsessive adherence to traditional notions of Jewish ethnocentrism and foreshadows a more contemporary Israeli will to power. What he envisions is not a society that is united by a multi- ethnic sense of common territoriality but rather a territory in which all of its eth- nically diverse inhabitants will eventually become bound together by a common acceptance of Jewish identity. Having traveled from Constantinople to Jerusalem to check on the state of his son's marriage, Avraham discovers, to his dismay, that Yosef s passion is directed not toward his young wife but toward an obsessive political preoccupa- tion-or, as he puts it, a dangerous idce fix. Yosef s "terrible idea" is that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine are the unknowing descendants of the original Hebrews, who were forcibly converted to Christianity and Islam by a succession of foreign invaders; that they are "Jews who still don't know that they are Jews" (305, 321); and that it is his mission to make them recognize their true identity. Yosef's obsessive and, ultimately, self-destructive pursuit of this convergence foregrounds the novel's concern with the complexities and dangers of the ongoing encounter between the Jews who have come from abroad to claim the Land of Israel and the indigenous Arabs who have long inhabited this land. The contours of the contribution that the character of Yosef Mani makes to the development of this thematic concern emerge from the correspondences that relate Yosef s perspective to that of Egon Bruner. Like Egon, Yosef is very much a product of a cultural heritage that he pro- fesses to reject. His quest for communal harmony is similarly tainted by his refusal to acknowledge the viability of national identities other than his own and by his readiness to eradicate all contradictions to his own national myth. Because he believes that "it is not possible for us to purify ourselves in the ancient womb of our ancestors if damned Jews were already running around in it and, with their usual insolence, demanding a partnership even here, even in our own myth," Egon argues that "We have to make it possible for them to cancel 16. A. B. Yehoshua, "Hatimah: levatel'et ha'akedah 'al yedei mimushah," in Ben-Dov, Bakivun hanegdi, 395. 175</page><page sequence="10">Gilead Morahg themselves" (140, 138). And he ruthlessly dedicates himself to doing precisely that. For Yosef, the Arabs are the intruders who are subverting the viability of his national myth and, like Egon, he seeks to dispose of this discomfiting presence by compelling the Arabs to cancel themselves. In pursuing this objective, he shows himself capable of being no less hard-hearted than Egon. The encounter with otherness constitutes a morally defining test of the ability to resist the temptation to reduce difference by force,"7 and, like Egon, Yosef utterly fails this test. When Avraham questions his son's plan and asks what will happen if the Arabs continue to insist on forgetting and refuse to remem- ber that they are actually Jews, Yosef s smile turns cruel. "If they insist," he says, "then we will make them suffer until they recognize themselves" (313, 331). Hearing this, Avraham understands that the fearlessness that Yosef displays in his forays among the Arabs, as well as the compassion he purports to feel for them, are products of the false sense of power he feels over them, products of a delusional and self-destructive belief in his capacity to subject them to his will by the infliction of constant pain. The contemporary overtones of Avraham's perceptions and his subsequent concerns are unmistakable. Commenting on Yosef s eagerness to mingle with the Arabs as they gather for prayer in their great mosque, Avraham says, He has no fear of them because of the pity he already feels for them. Because he has already finished reliving in his mind all the agonies he will have to inflict upon them due to their stubbornness, all the pain and the sorrow that he will have to bring upon them and upon their descendants after them. This is why he is already wallowing in pity, not realizing that before he finishes pitying them, they will grab him and wreak their vengeance upon him. (319, 337) This is a succinct articulation of the fundamental moral flaw in Yosef's vision of a unified territorial identity that is attained through the forceful suppression of diver- gent ethnic entities and the imposition of the will of one nation on another. It is also a prescient warning of the tragic consequences that the implementation of such a vision may cause, not only to the oppressed but to the oppressor as well. But Mr. Mani is not only a cautionary novel. Although the deep faults that it exposes mark the pitfalls of a particular ideological course, they also indicate an alternative vision that could lead in an opposite, more beneficial direction. Elements of this alternative direction are evident throughout the novel, but it is most fully embodied in the figure of the second Yosef Mani in the third section. The third section of Mr. Mani is narrated by Ivor Horowitz, a Jewish legal officer in the British army who is stationed in Jerusalem after its capture by General Allenby in 1917. Horowitz is assigned to the case against Yosef Mani, a native of Jerusalem who is charged with repeatedly crossing enemy lines and betraying British military secrets to the Turks. Yosef's inner world is exposed 17.

But the dynamics of his narration lead to an increasing concentration on Yosef s political pursuits and his growing preoccupation with questions of national identity. Horowitz depicts Yosef s life as a constant quest for political purpose. He describes Yosef starting out as an intense youth preparing for a life of still- undetermined political direction. The revolution of the Young Turks provides his first sense of political destination. Their vision of a multiethnic and multinational state captivates him, and he dreams of studying law and getting elected to the Turkish parliament. In 1907, Yosef actually sets out for Constantinople in pursuit of his dream but ends up staying Beirut for seven years. During his stay in this cosmopolitan city, Yosef continues to prepare himself for the life he has chosen, taking courses at the American University but concentrating primarily on the extensive legal and cultural curriculum he has designed for himself. In con- junction with these varied academic pursuits, Yosef continues what Horowitz describes as his equally diverse "practical education," attending "meetings of Shiites, Druze, Christian Communists, Maronites, Catholics, and all kinds of cle- rical assemblies, moving from identity to identity, the identities all intermingling" (175, 176). He also maintains his connections with the Sephardic Jewish commu- nity and makes the acquaintance of many young eastern European Jews headed for Palestine. We are not told specifically what Yosef concluded from these experi- ences. But when Turkey joins Germany in its war and Yosef returns to Jerusalem, something has clearly changed. He continues his practice of studying current pol- itical events and associating freely with members of the city's varied ethnic and religious communities. But at the Zionist meetings he attends, he no longer espouses his old universalist creed but presents himself as a spokesman for the indi- genous population of Palestine. At these meetings, "he would stand up from time to time and ask a question in the name of the true natives of this land" (177, 178). This ideological turn toward nativism is another stage in Yosef s ongoing process of self-education and identity formation. Impervious to received opinion, he seeks a practical wisdom derived from careful attentiveness to the mul- tifaceted political realities of his time and distilled from the views resonating in the diverse communities that share his space. The unexpected arrival of the British from the south is a new political reality that Yosef feels compelled to explore. He makes his way to Hebron, where he meets up with the advancing British forces and, demonstrating his native knowledge of the languages of the land, quickly acquires a position as an interpreter for them. But with his new nativist loathing for both the Ottoman Turks and the imperial British, Yosef thinks to himself, "Once again, foreigners are coming here to replace other foreigners" (181, 183). News of the Balfour Declaration causes Yosef s sense of political rea- lities to shift again. He regards the British declaration of support for a Jewish national home in Palestine as wondrously generous and wholly unexpected. In his innocence, Yosef expects that the British "would conquer the city, hand the keys of government to the natives of the land and politely bow out" (182, 186). The disillusioning realization that they have no intention of doing so confirms 177</page><page sequence="12">Gilead Morahg his earlier dismay at the fact that "here again are foreigners replacing other foreigners" (183, 186). As he thinks about all of this, another internal development occurs. This one is definitive: Lying in his big bed, seeking to make sense of what has occurred, Yosef's "heart suddenly stirs for the Arabs" (184, 187). As is often the case in Yehoshua's fiction, the unexpected experience of empathic awareness is a pivotal point in the protagonist's development and, con- comitantly, a key thematic signifier. In Mr. Mani, the awakening of compassion completes Yosef's political education. It provides the constancy that is necessary to navigate Palestine's constantly shifting political currents. Consciousness of compassion transforms Yosef from a man of endless political introspection to one who is prepared to take decisive political action. Night after night, he steals across enemy lines and exchanges the secret military documents he has obtained for permission to address the Arabs on the Turkish side in order to raise their pol- itical consciousness before it is too late. Night after night, he stands before groups of sullen Arab villagers who have been forcibly assembled by the Turks to warn them of the coming perils and advise them of the steps they must take to avert them: And this is what he would say to them: "Who are you? Wake up before it is too late and the world is completely changed. Get yourself an identity fast!" And he takes out his Arabic translation of Lord Balfour's declaration and reads it to them without explanation. Then he continues, "This land is yours and it is ours, half for you and half for us." And he points toward Jerusalem. and says, "The British are over there and the Turks are over here, but they will all leave, and we will be left alone. So stop sleeping and wake up." (186, 189) The reality he wants them to awaken to is that the Balfour Declaration's promise of a Jewish national home has created the conditions for a massive influx of Jewish immigrants that will drastically alter the demographic balance in the land and put the Palestinian Arabs at a distinct disadvantage. He wants them to understand that, as a result of these new circumstances, the Jews have become "like a swarm of locusts that is now hiding in the desert but will soon swoop down" (188, 191). He also offers them a preemptive solution that may avert this impending danger. Toward the end of each speech, Yosef displays a handmade map of Pales- tine and reiterates, "Get yourself an identity. All over the world nations are taking on identities. If you delay, it will be too late. If you delay, there will be a disaster. Because we are coming." And he takes out a pair of scissors and says, "Half for us and half for you." Then he cuts the map from top to bottom, giving them the half with the mountains and the Jordan River and keeping the coast and the sea for himself. (187, 190) When they seem disappointed by not getting the sea, he takes out another map and cuts it in half the other way. 178</page><page sequence="13">Borderline Cases "If I had to define Zionism in a single word," Yehoshua writes, "I would say boundaries."'8 He believes that a clear consciousness of the physical boundaries of Israel is a prerequisite for attaining what he calls an "organic consciousness" of Israeli identity.19 Of all the ideologues in Mr. Mani, the second Yosef s position on the Arab-Jewish issue is closest to Yehoshua's own belief. Misapprehended and ignored by all sides, his plea for amicable territorial separation is based on a native recognition of the equal humanity of both Jews and Arabs and an accep- tance of their disparate and immutable national identities. His proposed solution stands in opposition to the contemporary implications of the ideological positions held by the first YosefMani and by Egon Bruner. Based on a perception of the two nations' equal claim to the land and on the need for an equitable partition that would enable both sides to maintain the integrity of their disparate national iden- tities, the second Yosef' s proposed solution repudiates both the fetishization of the land and the readiness to impose ethnic exclusivity on it. And it is configured in Mr Mani as the only morally and pragmatically viable alternative to the present condition of opposition, which will prove to be catastrophic to both sides. The abiding heritage of national pathology that is recapitulated in the present policies of occupation and subjugation is symbolically actualized in Gavriel Mani's suicidal compulsion. The character of Hagar Shiloh, who is the voice of the novel's most contemporary perspective, is constructed as an antithesis and possible antidote to this morbid self-destructiveness. This aspect of Hagar's char- acter begins to come into focus when she accompanies Gavriel Mani to Jerusa- lem's old Jewish cemetery for a memorial service for his mother. At the cemetery, Hagar is overcome by cramps that are so painful she fears she is about to lose the child she believes she is carrying. She decides not to make the difficult way back to Jewish Jerusalem but to seek help in the much closer hospital in the Arab sector of the city. Hagar's staunch incursion into an exclusively Arab space is analogous to the intrusive forays of the first Yosef Mani. Here, as is often the case in Mr. Mani, apposition serves to accentuate contrast. Hers is not an aggressive attempt to impose ideological will on others but a no less resolute insis- tence that people show good will toward each other, irrespective of their national differences and political divides. Both the Arab nurse who receives Hagar at the hospital and the Arab doctor who is eventually summoned make it clear that they would prefer she leave their premises and seek help in a Jewish hospital. But Hagar is unyielding. She insists that they treat her not as an intruding Israeli but as an individual who is in need of their help. Significantly, Hagar's straightforward humanity causes the others to respond in kind. The doctor permits her to stay and rest in the bed she has com- mandeered. The nurse, who was so antagonistic at the outset, brings her lunch and a fresh change of underwear. And when Hagar finally leaves the hospital, 18. A. B.

Hagar's brief sojourn in Arab East Jerusalem is one of the most delicately suggestive episodes in Mr. Mani. Throughout her stay, the small triumphs of con- siderate humaneness over the impediments of national difference are leavened by intimations that such beneficent coexistence can be sustained only in conditions of self-contained separateness. Hagar is repeatedly suffused with the sense that this is a place in which she is an outsider and to which the Arabs she encounters naturally belong. She feels this sense of distinct and separate Arab space most strongly as she rides along in the hospital van: "I began traveling through Jerusalem from the opposite direction that evening, together with the hospital workers who had finished their shift," she tells Ya'el, And it was the most wondrous journey, Mom. To places where you have never been, through neighborhoods and little villages that are right inside the city itself, dipping at times through barren ravines, still spotted with snow, and bumping into dark streets, full of potholes and big puddles, that would sud- denly turn into bustling commercial centers alive with colors and people, young and old, walking along with their donkeys or shopping bags. And everyone actually seemed very pleasant and very relaxed, as if they really felt good being alone together and may have even become accustomed to us. (71, 63; emphasis added) Hagar's account of her experiences in the Arab sector of Jerusalem con- cludes with the intimation that mutual separation would be as healthy for the integ- rity of Palestinian identity as it would for the transformation of the Israeli sense of self. As the last of the Arab workers gets off near the Jaffa Gate and the van turns toward the Jewish part of the city, Hagar senses the transformative effects of these experiences on her own self. "Suddenly," she says, "I had the feeling that, for the first time in these three days, I was not going in the opposite direction but rather in the simple, flowing, right direction." (71, 63; emphasis in the original). Approach- ing Gavriel Mani's neighborhood, she feels that she has "come back home" (74, 63), and the streets that she remembered from that morning as being "silent and empty, are now also full of vibrant life" (71, 63). The precise nature of this right direction and its association with the possibilities of vibrant life are indicated not only by Hagar's movement away from Arab Jerusalem and back to Jewish Jerusalem, where she belongs, but also by what transpires in her subsequent encounter with what she perceives as another of Gavriel Mani's suicide attempts. The first time Hagar stumbles on Gavriel's makeshift gallows and tries to prevent the judge from making use if it, the struggle between them takes place in total silence. By the time of her return from East Jerusalem, Hagar's intervening experiences have instilled in her a deeper empathic understanding that now enables her to intuit the element that was missing from her previous preventive efforts. Until that time, Hagar's determination to thwart the judge's self-destructive drive had led to recurrent variations of a mute struggle between opposing forces that will not relent. But now, when she once again enters Gavriel's darkened 180</page><page sequence="15">Borderline Cases apartment and finds him holding a straight-edged razor and bleeding at the neck, Hagar not only takes firm action but is also able to give clear voice to her compas- sionate concern for another, imploring him to desist, not only at this time but forever: "I grabbed his hand, held it hard, and said very quietly and very firmly, I beg of you, please don't do this anymore" (72, 64). More than anything else, it is this unaffected articulation of the value of his life that moves Gavriel to recognize the fearsome reality of his suicidal drive. "I saw that he was completely surprised by me," Hagar tells Ya'el. "Stunned. He ran his other hand over his face and his neck, saw it come back smeared with blood, and was really scared" (72, 64). This is the climactic moment of the novel's first section and one of the signifying centers of Mr. Mani as a whole. It constitutes the psychological turning point at which Gavriel's attempts to destroy himself appear to end and his communion with Hagar, which is later extended to the rest of her family, begins. Hagar's plea to Gavriel, who embodies the self-destructive heritage of his nation, that he cease and desist is also the cul- minating call of Mr Mani as a whole. The fact that Gavriel appears to awaken to his existential peril in response to Hagar's heartfelt plea introduces the prospect of reversing a particularly precarious historical direction. The specific nature of this alternative orientation is retrospectively intimated in the biographical supplement to the novel's first section. The biographical supplements that are appended to each of Mr Mani's sec- tions are an integral part of the novel's signifying structure. They frame the discor- dant array of perspectives offered by the five fictional speakers with the integrative perspective of the implied author. Read in retrospect, the biographical supplement to the first section constitutes both the chronological and metaphorical culmination of the story that Mr. Mani tells. It recounts the nascent emotional bonding of Gavriel Mani and Hagar's mother, Ya'el, and notes the consequent alteration of Gavriel' s sense of territorial affinity. We learn that Hagar continued her relation- ship with Efi and bore a son, Roni. Efi, who had no intention of marrying Hagar, showed little interest in their son. Gavriel, on the other hand, began traveling with increasing frequency from Jerusalem to Mash'abei Sadeh, the southern kibbutz to which Hagar had returned to raise Roni. The increasing frequency of Gavriel's visits to the kibbutz is not only a result of his sense of responsibility for Roni but also "to the special connection that had formed between the child's grandfather and Hagar's mother" (78, 70). Their attraction is mutual despite their many differ- ences, including their disagreement on the wisdom of disregarding the national claims of the Arab inhabitants of the territories Israel occupied after the 1967 war, as well as the dangers resulting from the conviction that Israeli Jews may use these territories as they will. When she finds out that, on his way from Jeru- salem to Mash'abei Sadeh, Gavriel regularly drives through Hebron, Ya'el pleads with him not to do this anymore, echoing her daughter and imparting political specificity to Hagar's plea that he cease and desist: "Ya'el warned him against driving through the southern villages of Mount Hebron. But Mr. Mani continued to claim that the way seemed safe and the villagers appeared peaceful so there was really no reason for him not to take the short way to the Negev" (80, 72). Despite Ya'el's admonitions, Gavriel continues to use the convenience 181</page><page sequence="16">Gilead Morahg of the road Israel has built through the West Bank, convinced that he will come to no harm. "But in early spring of 1987, his car was hit by a big rock near the village of Dir El Manna, some twenty kilometers south of Hebron. That evening, he admitted to Ya'el that it made good sense not to go through there anymore, even though that route continued to attract him, for some reason" (80, 73). Though Gavriel may not be able to fathom the cause of this attraction, the novel provides its readers with the means of doing so. The third section of Mr. Mani reveals that Gavriel has an old family connection to this particular location. It is precisely the place, "south of Hebron on the way to Beersheba," to which, seventy years earlier, his grandfather, Yosef Mani, traveled on the way to his trans- formative encounter with the advancing British forces (178, 180). And, as is often the case, this resonance between the Mani family strands produces signifying configurations with distinct national implications. As the biblical burial site of Avraham and his beloved wife Sarah, Hebron's place of pride in Jewish consciousness dates back to the patriarchal past and pro- ceeds through the epochs to modem times. Hebron epitomizes the claims of those who believe that Jews have the historic right and religious obligation to inhabit the territories of the West Bank, with its many sacred sites. The long cultural legacy of these sites also explains why many of those Jews who advocate withdrawal from them do so with a heavy heart. The fact that the most contemporary section of Mr. Mani concludes with Gavriel's determination to refrain from traversing these territories is as significant as his reason for doing so. The totality of Mr. Mani postulates the historic continuity of a powerful strain of Jewish ideology that insists Jews can retain their identity as a separate nation while insinuating themselves into the living tissues of other nations as a primal source of existential danger. Gavriel Mani's new readiness to recognize the wisdom of remaining within the bounds of Israel's old borders is a hopeful narrative gesture toward the possibility of a new cultural orientation that will alleviate the historic national impulse toward self-annihilation.
