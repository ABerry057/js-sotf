Originally published in Hebrew under the title Shafrir Mitzrayim (Tel Aviv, 1995), this thoroughly researched monograph, based on some 800 documents from the Cairo Genizah, illuminates an obscure and overlooked chapter in the history of the Jewish communities that flourished in the medieval Islamic world. As the au- thor notes in her foreword, previous studies of Jewish leadership in Muslim lands have discounted the importance of local political activity, emphasizing instead the dominant role of the central authorities, that is, the Exilarchate and the yeshivot of Babylonia and Palestine. Bareket takes up the question of local leadership by fo- cusing on the careers of nine individuals who headed the Palestinian and Babylon- ian congregations in Fustat's Jewish community during the first half of the eleventh century. While these leaders formally recognized the sovereignty of the central au- thorities, they nevertheless exercised considerable autonomy, establishing in Fustat a local school (midrash) for Torah study, issuing their own responsa, imposing bans, and corresponding with Jewish leaders outside of Egypt. Bareket's decision to concentrate on the first half of the eleventh century is 142</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews significant. The later decline of the Palestinian yeshiva as a result of internal struggles, followed by its relocation to Tyre after the Seljuk conquest of Jerusalem (summer of 1073), has been viewed as a critical antecedent to the emergence of a fully mature local leadership in Egypt. Bareket's findings, however, indicate that a strong tradition of local rule was found in Fustat even before the Palestinian yeshiva's grip on Egypt was loosened. Furthermore, beginning at a time when the Palestinian yeshiva's authority was still strong allows her to challenge the view that the Palestinian geonim were uniformly opposed to such manifestations of auton- omy by local leaders. The first two chapters examine the Jewish community of Fustat following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. In the first, Bareket demonstrates sensitiv- ity to the vibrance of local political life with her description of Fustat's complex Jewish population, which comprised numerous smaller groups and factions (Pales- tinians, Babylonians, Maghrebis, Karaites, etc.). These overlapping loyalties form the crucial demographic backdrop against which the occasionally erratic behavior of Fustat's congregational leaders must be evaluated. Bareket's subsequent dis- cussion of the community institutions illustrates the broad range of responsibili- ties that fell to Fustat's leaders, as well as the various opportunities for indepen- dent action open to them. Perhaps the most important of these institutions was the local court, through which the heads of Fustat's Jewish community exercised con- siderable independence in religious and political matters. Chapter Three introduces the biographical sketches that close out the book. Bareket demonstrates that Fustat's local leaders were exceptional individuals who brought to their posts experience, wealth, and a network of family connections. They were also learned: all of her subjects composed piyyut, and many wrote com- mentaries on sections of the Bible and the Talmud. Bareket contends that their con- trol over the local Jewish population, and over Egyptian Jewry generally, was far more centralized than has been recognized. Thus she convincingly argues, contra the earlier view, that Fustat's Palestinian and Babylonian congregations constitut- ed a single, unified rabbanite Jewish community. A number of the congregation- al leaders-Babylonians Shemarya ben Elhanan and Elhanan ben Shemarya and the Palestinian Ephraim ben Shemarya-appear also to have headed up this unit- ed rabbanite community. Moreover, at the height of Ephraim ben Shemarya's ca- reer (1040s) even important Egyptian cities like Alexandria acknowledged the pre- eminence of Fustat and its leader. Bareket shows that a few of these leaders were also in close touch with Jewish communities outside of Egypt. Elhanan ben She- marya, for example, visited numerous towns in Palestine, Syria, and Iraq, renew- ing contacts with supporters and cultivating his image as a regional figure. Bareket insists, however, that despite their extensive authority, none of these individuals intended to undermine the Palestinian yeshiva; they remained loyal to the institu- tion and its geonim. The English translation is at times clumsy, and, unfortunately, also lacks the judicious selection of skillfully edited primary documents that accompanies the Hebrew text. Nevertheless, the book's appearance in English is an auspicious sign that scholarship on the documentary materials from the Cairo Genizah has found 143</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews a wider audience among historians. It is to be hoped that the burst of interest in the Genizah witnessed in recent years will carry this trend further. The emergence in Muslim lands of local Jewish leadership has long been as- sociated with the decline of the Exilarchate and the yeshivot of Babylonia and Palestine. Fustat on the Nile compellingly argues that a precedent for local politi- cal leadership existed even as these institutions experienced renewed vigor during the first decades of the eleventh century. It is a point both well-taken and sure to stimulate further research. Arnold Franklin New York University New York, New York</page></plain_text>
