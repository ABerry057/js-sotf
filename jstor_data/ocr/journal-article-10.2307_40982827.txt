All topics and approaches to history are welcome, whether cultural, social, political, diplomatic, intellectual, economic, and military history, as well as historiography and methodology. Contributions that treat new fields, such as post-1945 and post-1989 history, maturing fields such as gender history, and less-represented fields such as medieval history and the history of the Habsburg lands are especially desired. The journal thus aims to be the primary venue for scholarly exchange and debate among scholars of the history of Central Europe. Central European History is especially valuable for: • cultural and social historians • political scientists • historians of Central Europe, Germany, and German-speaking regions • intellectual historians • military historians Recommend Central European History to your librarian from its homepage.
