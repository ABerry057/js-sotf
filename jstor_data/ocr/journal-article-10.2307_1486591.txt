<plain_text><page sequence="1">316 BOOK REVIEWS David Shaary. "Plain Zionism" to "General Zionism": Unity and Split in the Early History of "General Zionism," 1929-1939. Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1990. ix, 294 pp. (Hebrew). Of all Zionist political movements, General Zionism is the least studied and the least understood. David Shaary's book, From "Plain Zionism" to "General Zionism ", a detailed analysis of the institutions and principles uniting and dividing General Zionists between the two world wars, will set a new standard for scholarship on the subject. No longer can the explanation that the General Zionists organized only to distinguish themselves from the socialists on the left and the revisionists on the right be supported. That this political movement has only recently begun to draw scholarly attention is understandable. Some of the movement's leaders-Chaim Weizmann, Nachum Sokolow, Menahem Ussishkin-had a strong presence in the World Zionist Organization and contributed to its earliest achievements. Quite naturally, historians have had some difficulties in coming to terms with such venerable leaders as political actors. Shaary has conducted his research into the history of this political movement with admirable rigor. By looking closely at the activities of the various groups and individuals initially dubbing themselves "plain Zionists," Shaary has transformed our conception of General Zionism. General Zionists did not fail to organize; they established many grass-roots movements and institutions in Jewish communities across Western and Eastern Europe and in Palestine. There were organizations of youth, groups centered around periodicals, and numerous associations pressing for economic and political reform. But all of these groups were initially reluctant to coalesce as a political faction and campaign for the enactment of policies they favored on partisan grounds. Their well-known political figures claimed to be above partisan politics. They called themselves unhyphenated Zionists, averring allegiance to no other defining principle. No other political goal was allowed to stand in the way of their nationalism. Nothing would weaken their commitment to the interests of the nation. Refusing to represent a specific social class or a particular set of economic interests, General Zionists sought to resolve conflicts in the light of collective needs, trying to protect the total array of fledgling enterprises in Palestine. Shaary identifies a cluster of issues of extreme importance to General Zionists and to the formation of their political stance, among them, how to organize the Jewish economy, the system of education, and how to</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 317 determine the proper allocation of resources between city and countryside. What the protracted struggle over particular issues did was to create a succession of occasions on which adversaries could take one another to task on questions considered fundamental to the survival of Zionism and to realizing its goals. According to Shaary, the sequence of encounters produced a common political agenda around which various General Zionist groups could at times even unite. In an era when political passions customarily found outlets in ideological debate, General Zionists engaged issues on pragmatic grounds. Many of them spent some of their best energies not on building their own organizations but rather on supporting institutions already established by Labor Zionists, which in such a supercharged context gave Labor Zionists the tactical advantage. Those who failed to build a political apparatus could not hope to prevail over those who did. And without support from a particular social base, leaders could not even become entrenched interests. Shaary's account of the emergence of General Zionism offers much of value to the serious student of Zionist history. The establishment of the British Mandate eroded the consensus forged by Zionists at their first congress in 1897 in Basel. There was little question but that British rule provided the opportunity to build a Jewish state. Yet, how to do so was unclear. For Zionists, World War I produced not one but many different formative experiences. In the aftermath of the war, Zionists faced daunting political and economic tasks, and their wartime experiences warranted no single strategy. Weizmann's proposals to include non-Zionists in an expanded Jewish Agency created substantial controversy. Weizmann's access to British policy makers, which led to the Balfour Declaration, a momentous breakthrough during the war, seemed problematic in the circumstances of peace. How to rationalize policy disputes without calling for Weizmann's resignation had a profoundly unsettling effect for his closest associates, among them many General Zionists. Traditional Zionist political thinking had proceeded with extreme cau- tion on the subject of the ultimate goal of founding a Jewish state. A new international order could not forge the political ties to sustain the old consensus or easily induce a new one. The new Eastern European geography unlinked many important Jewish communities. Not only were political systems transformed, the cultural milieu in which Zionist political engagements took place was significantly altered. Building upon an impressive body of historical scholarship, Shaary</page><page sequence="3">318 BOOK REVIEWS draws on archival material not only to deepen our knowledge of Zionism's political center, but also to demonstrate how heterogeneous a political conglomerate it was and how necessarily diverse its impulses.
