Several of these were mas kilic translations1 of German children's books such as Georg Christian Raff's Nat urgeschichte fur Kinder or Joachim Heinrich Campe's travel stories for children.2 Others were fragmentary translations of German science books such as Anton Friedrich Biisching's Neue Erdbeschreibung.3 These translations were inspired I would like to thank Shulamit Volkov, David Assaf, Roni Hirsh-Ratzkovsky, Hanan Harif, and the anonymous AJS Review reader for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper. I am also grateful to Arthur Kiron and Judith Leifer of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library and Aviad Stollman of the National Library of Israel for their kind assistance. Research for this article was made possible by the generous fellowships I received from the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania; and the Franz Rosenzweig-Minerva Research Center, the Hebrew University. I am deeply indebted to the directors, fellows, and staff of both centers for their extended support and encouragement. 1. My use of the term "translation" to describe these texts is inspired by Gideon Toury's discus sion of the problems inherent in any essentialist definition of "translation." He suggests that translation by its very nature eludes rigid, ahistorical definitions and must be defined contextually, according to how it is perceived in the target culture. See Gideon Toury, "The Notion of 'Assumed Translation': An Invitation to a New Discussion," in Letterlijkheid, Woordelijheid, ed. H. Bloemen, E. Hertog, and W. Segers (Antwerp/Harmelen: Fantom, 1995), 141^7. For a further discussion of the problems inherent in differentiating between translations and adaptations, see Georges L.

The scientific, geographical, and phi losophical knowledge offered by the source texts, combined with the rhetoric of voyage and discovery, as well as the stories of domesticating and acculturating "savage" peoples and wild animals, provided the maskilim with a compelling plat form for disseminating maskilic knowledge, ideology, and goals. In the past few years scholars have become increasingly aware of the pivotal role played by some of these translations in the formation of a modern Hebrew library. Although scholarly attention has begun to focus on maskilic translations, very little attention has been given to the colonial aspects of these translations or to their treatment of such issues as "race," anthropological description, and differ ence. Moreover, scholars have tended to overlook translations produced by Jews who were not an integral part of the burgeoning maskilic elite. And yet, throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries new ideas in science and philosophy were being disseminated from the centers of European Enlighten ment, such as Paris, London, and Berlin, to the Jewish quarters of eastern Europe. Here, they often found an eager audience that embraced these new ideas with a mixture of anticipation, fascination, and anxiety, and adapted them to meet their own needs. Among these hesitant consumers of modernity was the renowned Lithua nian talmudist Abraham ben Elijah of Vilna, son of the famed Vilna Gaon. In 1801, Ben Elijah anonymously published a geography book titled Gevulot 'arez.4 In the vast ocean of rabbinic texts of the period, including Ben Elijah's own works, the book hardly made a ripple. Indeed to this day it has received very limited scholarly attention and has been misrepresented both with regard to its original author and its content. And yet Ben Elijah's book is a unique Hebrew translation, which offers a fascinating lesson on forgotten forms of cul tural transfer that took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen turies between the east European rabbinic elite and the Jewish as well as "general" Enlightenments. In a similar vein to many other Hebrew translations of its time, Gevulot 'arez was published as an original work in Hebrew with no mention of the book's original author or the fact that it was a translation. As a result, contemporary scho larship has treated the book as the original work of Ben Elijah and has made no attempt to discover its source text. But the greater part of Ben Elijah's book is not, in fact, original work; it is a translation of an adaptation of what was perhaps the most famous eighteenth-century natural history—Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle, published in thirty-six volumes between 1749 and 1789.5 4. [Abraham Ben Elijah of Vilna], Gevulot 'arez (Berlin, 1801). 5. Gevulot 'arez contains three separate chapters. The present article discusses only the first two. which comprise the bulk of the text (la-lOa) and are translations of two chapters of Giovanni Ferry's adaptation of Buffon's Histoire Naturelle. The third chapter of Gevulot 'arez (1 Ob—15b) features a description of various cities around the globe. This is not a translation of either Ferry's or Buffon's 296</page><page sequence="3">"Their Eyes Shall Behold Strange Things" A second ubiquitous misrepresentation of Gevulot 'arez is the scholarly ten dency, evident in at least two separate studies on Ben Elijah, to present the book as a work that discusses the lives and whereabouts of Jews in the Diaspora.6 In reality, the history and geography of the Jews plays a minor role in Gevulot 'arez—only a single chapter is dedicated to the geographical and anthropological description of Jews, and it is only eight lines long—one of the shortest in the book. Northern peoples, on the other hand, receive two full pages filled with detailed descriptions of their cultural practices, religion (or lack thereof), and physical appearance. Four pages are devoted to Blacks and just over four to an elaborate anthropological description of Native Americans. Ben Elijah's preface to the trans lation is also ripe with references to "exotic" peoples and places and with dramatic descriptions of godless, lawless nations that inhabit torrid deserts and frozen lands. These peoples, "whose eyes shall behold strange things and whose hearts shall utter perverse things" (JTDlsnn "QT m1?! m~iT INT Dirry), were used by Ben Elijah to lure the reader into the book.7 Clearly, then, Ben Elijah's main object of interest in the book was not the all-too-familiar history and geography of the Jews, but rather the strange "new worlds" of the eighteenth century. Ben Elijah aimed to introduce his readers to something new and to expose them to what he perceived to be the forefront of scientific research and geographical discovery of his time. The Question of Authorship Gevulot 'arez was originally attributed to Ben Elijah by Shmuel Yosef Fiinn in his 1860 Kiryah ne'emanah,s Subsequent studies have relied on this attribution as the sole proof that Ben Elijah was the author of the text.9 Given this author's maskilic agenda and his distinct desire to demonstrate the compatibility between the Haskalah and tradition, such reliance on Fiinn is highly problematic. And indeed, in a study dedicated to the life and teachings of the Vilna Gaon, Dov Eliah cast serious doubts on Fiinn's claims: Anyone who takes this book into his hands can immediately see that a gaon such as R. Abraham would never have wasted his time and energy on such an odd, superficial, and poorly written book. Admittedly, the book quotes works. It may be the author's original creation but is more likely a translation of another source, which remains to be discovered. 6. David Halahmi-Weissbrod, Hakhmei Tisra 'el, 2nd ed.

Throughout his study he attempted to show that the mitnagdim, and especially Ben Elijah's father, the Vilna Gaon, were adamantly opposed to, the Haskalah." Still there is merit to the claim that the question of Gevulot 'arez's authorship cannot be resolved by relying solely on FLinn's attribution. How then are we to determine the identity of the work's author? One approach would be to determine which "secular" works Ben Elijah may have had access to, but this is difficult to ascertain. In his commentary on Psalms, he mentioned having read "books on nature," but did not cite any contemporary studies by name.12 In his major bibliographical work, Ravpe 'alim, he demonstrated a thorough knowledge of rabbinic literature, but made no note of "secular," let alone non-Jewish, works (except for the occasional reference to Aristotle). Given the norms and nature of the Hebrew literature of the period, this is not surprising. Even conservative maski lim such as Samson Bloch or Yehudah Horowitz were reluctant to proclaim their use of non-Jewish or "secular" works. Thus, in his Shevilei 'olam Bloch used a great deal of anthropological and geographical information taken from the scientific litera ture of the Enlightenment, but referred in his footnotes to such sources as Hazal or Maimonides. Horowitz, on his part, was inspired in his 'Amudei beit Yehuda by the philosophical literature of the Enlightenment, but attributed his sources of influence to R. Judah Halevi and Maimonides.13 The question of authorship cannot, then, be resolved through a reconstruc tion of Ben Elijah's library based on his bibliographical work. Contrary to Eliah's claims, however, a comparison between Gevulot 'arez and other works by Ben Elijah shows an overlap in vocabulary, linguistic features, and style. Thus, for instance, Ben Elijah used the somewhat infrequent expression "and we/he were/ was bereft of' (una l/iorni) both in Gevulot 'arez and in his Se'arat Eliyahu,14 An additional example of overlapping vocabulary may be found in Ben Elijah's preface to his commentary on Midrash 'aggadat Bereshit, which ends with the 10.

The same phrase is found in the preface to Gevulot 'arez.15 Due, however, to the intertextual nature of rabbinic literature, such recurring uses of Hebrew phrases are highly dubious as evidence with regard to the question of authorship. More convincing as evidence are the conceptual overlaps between Ben Elijah's writings and Gevulot 'arez. Perhaps the most telling example is in Ben Elijah's commentary on Targum Onkelos, which was published posthumously in 1896. In this commentary Ben Elijah explained that Onkelos's "Kardu," or Mount Ararat, was in "the land of Turkmenia": I have seen in the writings of geography, that Ararat lies in the land of Turk menia in the part of "Asia" between Natalian and Persia, and is known in their language as Ararat as well, and is called Mount Kardunis, which means Mount Kardum, and it is written that it is very tall and may be seen from a distance of fifty leagues, see in the book ofMinhah belulah... pto is^jsa'pniu nnaa [!] naait? unnxc ,px npns wki ,mp ,cnnx] in ''D Omnp-BMKO xnpj run ims mitto xnp^i ,01s hi pn "jots" nma 'on T"s ,mxons trtpan pinna mix D'sina? iv 7ixa mm Nine v^v inrai mnp 16[...^3 An almost identical description of Ararat appears in Gevulot 'arez. The author gives a short overview of the differing opinions regarding the location of Ararat, including that of "...the great Rabbi Abraham in his book Minhah belulah...,"-, and concludes that [t]he truth lies with Nachmanides [who claimed that the Ararat mountains] are in Babylon. And it is in the country of Turkmenia, which is the old Armenia, and they are called the "Mountains of Ararat" in all languages and are also called Mt. Gardikus, like the Kardu ranges, and they are so tall that it is poss ible to see them from a distance of fifty leagues.

They point to the fact that Ben Elijah was either the author of Gevulot 'arez or a zealous reader of the book. The aforementioned unpublished geography gives further support to the notion that Ben Elijah was indeed the author of Gevulot 'arez. Not only does this work, which discussed the geographies and histories of such places as Spain, Portugal, and America, bear witness to Ben Elijah's passion for geography, but it also offers further similarities to Gevulot 'arez. Thus, for instance, elsewhere in the manuscript Ben Elijah discussed the flora and fauna of the island of Mada gascar and explained: "We find there many salamanders" n»t£&gt; m nmn).19 Interestingly, the salamander is the only animal mentioned by its particu lar name in the text—other animals are discussed under wider family terms such as "fish," "birds," and so forth. The special attention given by Ben Elijah to the sal amander may derive from the long-standing rabbinic debate regarding this animal.20 And indeed the salamander received similar special attention in Gevulot 'arez, with the author claiming that Madagascar is the only country where the salamander may be found today in great numbers (nm XSQ3 rDira pi mi1? N-ma^Non).21 Other conceptual and literary overlaps between the two works are also readily apparent. In both texts, the author turned to the authority of the ancients while discussing contemporary geography. Furthermore, in both there is an attempt to establish the etymology of the names of various countries and cities, a discussion of their width and length in leagues (nisons), and of their histories, including their various kings and rulers.22 Indeed it could very well be that Ben Elijah's geographical manuscript was meant to serve as a kind of supplementary volume to Gevulot 'arez, with the former focusing on geography, history, and ety mology, and the latter on anthropology and natural history. It could also be that the work remained in manuscript form due to the poor reception of Gevulot 'arez, which, to the best of our knowledge today, was printed in a single edition only. The few pages of the manuscript that have survived offer only a general idea as to the nature and purpose of the work in its entirety. America, and parts of Africa, as well as a discussion of the etymology of various countries' names. In his Sefer ha-Gra, Judah Leib Maimon states that he has in his private library some manuscripts on geography in Ben Elijah's own handwriting. These manuscripts have now been lost; however, it is poss ible that Maimon is referring to Ge 'ografiyah shel erez Yisra 'el.

Taken together with Fiinn's testimony, they leave little room for doubt that Ben Elijah was indeed the author of Gevulot 'arez. It is possible that Ben Elijah was apprehensive about publishing the book under his own name, and thus chose to publish it anon ymously in Berlin, instead of in his native Vilna.23 Whatever his motives, it appears safe to assume that it was in fact Ben Elijah who produced this unique Hebrew translation of Buffon.24 Buffon's Status among Hebrew Writers of the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries One of the first questions arising from Ben Elijah's translation of Buffon is why he chose to conceal the identity of the book's original author. Other Hebrew writers of the period took pride in their use of Buffon, sometimes unjustifiably so. Both the Polish kabbalist Pinhas Horowitz and the Hannover born maskil Baruch Linda, for instance, claimed to have used Buffon in the writing of their own books. If Linda seems to have done so only in passing, Horowitz—not at all.25 Indeed, Buffon appears to have enjoyed a somewhat privileged status among Jewish writers of the period, and he continued to main tain this position well after being discarded, to some extent, by non-Jewish thinkers toward the beginning of the nineteenth century. His continued popu larity is evident from Sholem Abramovitsh's praise of the naturalist in the preface to his 1862 translation of Harald Othmar Lenz's Gemeinniitzige Naturgeschichte: And some have invented various methods for the study of natural history, and of all these different methods the method of the naturalist Buffon is the best, as he urged the wise to call upon the doors of nature and to investigate its mys teries, and therefore before the sun his name is continued, and his fame goes forth throughout the land. 23. Winer speculated that an earlier edition may have appeared in Vilna. See Winer, Kohelet Moshe, 227. 24. The attribution of Gevulot 'arez to Ben Elijah, however, is not ironclad; and further research may reveal additional similarities between this text and other works by Ben Elijah. 25. Pinhas Horowitz, Sefer ha-brit ha-shalem (1797; repr., Jerusalem: Yerid ha-Sefarim, 1990), 199; Baruch Linda, Reshit limudim (Berlin: Hevrat Hinuch Na'arim, 1788), [17]. Previous studies have argued convincingly that Horowitz's main source of scientific information was not Bufifon, but rather Linda. See Tal Kogman, Yezirat dimuyei ha-yeda' ba- 'arazot dovrot ha-germanit be-tkufat ha-haskalah (PhD diss., Tel-Aviv University, 2000), 85-86; Noah Rosenblum, 'Iyunei sifrut ve-hagut mi-shilhei ha-me'ah ha-shmone 'esre 'ad yameinu (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass, 1989), 5-6, 36. Horowitz appears to have also used Baruch Schick's Sefer tiferet ha- 'adam, whereas Linda appears to have been familiar with Buffon's text firsthand. See Idelson-Shein, Ha-ekzoti, 76-77, 286-89, 293-95. A further example of an eighteenth-century Hebrew reference to Buffon (referred to as "Buffang") may be found in Mor dehai Gumpel Schnaber Levison's: Shlosh 'esreh yesodei hatorah (Altona, 1791), 96a. 301</page><page sequence="8">Iris Idelson-Shein Q'Dnn "7D pi yaon mVin nso mroi a'D© (isnxnusa) cram pi wxan wi] a'aann h -p»n Kin •■an ,ns» nm nam ,indd-d 'snon npinn -pi rpn rvuiipn ■fnn Israel ion? pr vkw i3s17 p ■?!&gt; .n'nai'ran '-lno -nprfn mVinn nm1?! TipErt&gt; 26[.psn ta This passage refers to Buffon's methodological trademark—the explanation of various natural and anthropological phenomena by turning to environmental factors such as climate, or cultural and nutritional practices. In contrast to the other great naturalist of his time, the Swedish botanist Carl von Linne (Linneaus), who attempted to categorize the natural world into rigid scientific taxonomies, Buffon's perception of nature was of a world in constant motion, a world that could not be organized into synchronic taxonomies but rather had to be described diachronically. Thus, each natural phenomenon, including human beings, was described against a specific historical and geographical context. This kind of circumstantial and fluid understanding of the ways in which differences between human beings were formed and perpetuated was extremely popular among Jewish authors of the period, and especially among the maskilim. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most maskilic writers on issues such as natural history, geography, and anthropology tended to associate the physical and "mental" characteristics of different ethnic groups with their various cultural and nutritional practices as well as with the different climates in which they lived. Skin color, for instance, was often explained by referring to environmental factors, the most important of which was climate. Other explanations tended to focus on cultural practices such as tattoos, hygienic practices, or the appli cation of various potions to the skin. The Galician maskil Joseph Perl, writing during the second decade of the nineteenth century, embraced these explanations: The Greenlanders appear white when they are born, but as they grow older, as they do not wash, filth begins to cover their skin, and turns the white into a shade of green. [In addition,] the smoke that surrounds them at all times, [as well as] the milk and oil with which they cover their bodies, makes them ugly and turns them into a shade of olive. k1?

In 1789, the Polish-French intellectual Zalkind Hourwitz stressed that "it is well known to all physicians that the physical constitution of the Jews is absolutely the same as all other nations that inhabit the same climate." (II est connu de tous les medecins que la constitution physique des Juifs est absolument la meme que celle autre nations qui habitant le meme climat.)29 A second Jewish apologist, the Portuguese-Dutch Isaac De Pinto, also harnessed the eighteenth century's fluid notions of difference to account for the physical and mental "traits" of the Jews. In a letter written sometime around 1746 to the French philo sopher Charles Marie de La Condamine, De Pinto stated, Transplanted nations gradually assume the colors that characterize the countries in which they settle.... They assume not only the habits of their new compatriots, but also the exterior composition of their bodies, as well as the interior disposition of their spirit. This is quite evident today in Holland, where the descendants of the Spanish, the Portuguese, and the French have become "Holland-ized," so to speak, in their color, temperament, and moods. [Les nations transplantees prenaient insensiblement la teinture de Pays ou elles s'etablissent.... Elles y contractent non seulement les habitudes de leurs nouveaux compatriotes, mais meme la figure exterieure du corps, ainsi que la disposition interieure de 1'Esprit. C'est ce que nous voyons tous les jours en hollande, ou les Enfants et les neveux, des Espagnols, des portugais, et des Francois, s'hollandisent pour ainsi dire, ils gagnent la meme couleur, ils acquierent le meme temperament, ils contractent la meme humeur.]30 De Pinto returned to these statements in a later, better-known correspondence with Voltaire, this time claiming that "[t]he Jew is a chameleon who everywhere takes on the colors of the various climates in which he lives, of the various people with whom he associates, and of the various forms of government under which he lives."

And perhaps this is the reason behind Ben Elijah's motivation for disguising his use of Buffon; unlike maskilim such as Linda, Schnaber Levison, and later writers like Abramovitsh, Ben Elijah, a renowned talmudist and son of the Vilna Gaon, could hardly be expected to announce his use of a notorious French deist such as Buffon. And yet, Ben Elijah's choice to present the translation as an original work in Hebrew is not uncharacteristic of contemporaneous Hebrew literature. Other Hebrew translators also exhibited a striking tendency to present their translations as original work—not only for translations of esoteric authors or children's writers but even for Hebrew trans lations of such renowned authors as Anton Friedrich Biisching and Friedrich von Schiller.32 Gevulot 'Arez as a Paradigmatic Early Modern Hebrew Translation33 The tendency to present translations as original work was of course not a uniquely Jewish translational norm. The eighteenth century has been dubbed by one scholar as "an age of plagiarism," dominated by literary pirates, armchair tra velers, and other writers who exhibited an extremely "liberal attitude to the 31.

Fragments of Biisching's Neue Erdbeschreibung were translated several times into Hebrew by Baruch Linda, Joseph Perl, and Shlomo Keysir. See Idelson-Shein, Ha-ekzoti, 290-95,403-5. Schil ler's "Die Biirgschaft" was translated into Hebrew in David Zamosc's Resisei ha-melizah. Though the original German version was provided in Hebrew transliteration, no note was made of the ballad's orig inal author. See David Zamosc, Resisei ha-melizah (Dyhrenfurth: Johann Erbricht und Hirsch Warschauer, 1821), 1:1-14. 33. The translational norms of the Haskalah have been studied in depth by such scholars as Zohar Shavit, Gideon Toury, and Tal Kogman. In what follows, I offer a review of a few central charac teristics of the turn-of-the-century Hebrew translations that correspond directly to Ben Elijah's work. For a more thorough discussion of the norms and characteristics of maskilic translation, see Zohar Shavit, "From Friedlander's Lesebuch to the Jewish Campe: The Beginning of Hebrew Children's Lit erature in Germany," Leo Baeck Institute Year Book 33 (1988): 385—415; Gideon Toury, Descriptive Translation Studies and Beyond (Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1995), 131-39; Toury, "Hebrew [Translation] Tradition," in Baker, Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies, 442-44; Tal Kogman, "Haskalah Scientific Knowledge in Hebrew Garment: A General Statement and Two Examples," Target 19, no. 1 (2007): 69-83. 304</page><page sequence="11">"Their Eyes Shall Behold Strange Things" borrowing of other writers' works."34 Still, there seems to have been something distinctive about the dominance that this particular translational norm held in the Hebrew literary world of the time. This may be gleaned by comparing the actions of Jewish translators writing either within or without the Hebrew literary system. In 1756, for instance, Moses Mendelssohn prepared the first German translation of Rousseau's second Discourse. He attributed the discourse to one "Johann Jacob Rousseau," and made no note of his own role in the text's trans lation. The translator's "transparency" was also evident in the nature of the trans lation itself; though critical of Rousseau's views on the nature of man and society, Mendelssohn offered his readers a translation aimed at adequacy, striving to keep the original's style and ideas intact. He saved his critique of Rousseau's ideas for an open letter to his close friend Gotthold Ephraim Lessing rather than expressing them in his translation through diversions from the source text.35 Around the same time that Mendelssohn's German translation of Rousseau was published, a second translation by Mendelssohn also appeared. The translation, a Hebrew version of Edward Young's The Complaint, or Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortal ity, was published in the early maskilic journal Kohelet musar. However this time, Mendelssohn chose to omit not only the name of the translator, but also that of Young, author of the original piece.36 This difference between Mendelssohn's choice in case of the Hebrew translation and that of the German translation is not merely accidental. During the second half of the eighteenth century, the choice to omit the translator's name was popular among German translators and served as a means of declaring the translator's adherence to the new translational norms of the period, which strove for adequacy and transparency.37 By compari son, the choice to omit the name of the author of the original text, or to present the text as the translator's own work, is indicative of a quite different translational norm—one that strives not for adequacy, but for acceptability and that emphasizes the pivotal role of the cultural mediator.38 The difference between the Hebrew and non-Hebrew translational norms of the late eighteenth century becomes even more evident when texts translated into 34.

A case in point is Georg Christian Raff's Naturgeschichte fur Kinder, translated into Hebrew by Baruch Linda in 1788 and into English by an anonymous translator in 1796. In the Hebrew text, nothing suggests that the work was a translation; Linda was pre sented as its original author. In the English version, while the translator's name was omitted from the text, the name of the author was prominent in the book's title: A System of Natural History, adapted for the Instruction of Youth. In the Form of a Dialogue. Originally written in German, by Prof. Raff of Goettingen.3,9 And though the English translator of Raff's work occasionally strayed from his source text, in general, he attempted to remain faithful to the original's style and content. In contrast, Linda, Raff's Hebrew translator, had no reservations about altering the style and content of Raff's book completely. As has been shown by Tal Kogman in her study of Linda's translation, Linda discarded the dialogic form completely and diverged from the text freely, often conveying messages that stood in direct opposition to the ones put forth by Raff.40 A further example is offered by Abraham Van Oven's 1778 translation of Robert Dodsley's immensely popular The Oeconomy of Human Life. Dodsley's book, a pseudotranslation of a fictitious Indian text, was originally published anonymously in 1750. The omission of the pseudotranslator's name appears to have supplied the book with an air of authenticity. But in Van-Oven's Hebrew translation, the translator's name was proudly displayed on the book's cover, while Dodsley, by this time known as the book's original author, was not men tioned anywhere in the Hebrew text.41 It appears then that Ben Elijah's choice to omit Buffon's name is consistent with the translational norms of the Hebrew literary system of the time, which tended to stress the importance of the translator, while deemphasizing that of the original author. A second distinctive characteristic of the turn-of-the-century corpus of Hebrew translations, also discernable in Ben Elijah's text, is the use of biblical 39.

Yehudah Friedlander and Hayim Shoham have argued that the maskilim tended to "incorporate into their text linguistic allusions.. .which created an interesting associative texture, thus allowing for the reception of the text in the desired way."42 There are ample examples of this translational norm in the writings of the Haskalah. In David Zamosc's Hebrew translation of Joachim Hein rich Campe's Sittenbuchlein fiir Kinder, the translator changed the name of the English sailor Thomas Inkle into the biblical "Bera," the name of the evil king of Sodom mentioned in Genesis 14:2. In Jewish imagination, "Bera" conjures images of evil and corruption, both in its literal meaning (ITQ means "in evil") and in its historical context. Thus, in a literary maneuver that allowed for the smooth reception of the text among its Jewish readers, the immoral English trader was transformed into an infamous biblical villain.43 Similar translational tactics may also be found in Gevulot 'arez. For instance, Ben Elijah used fragments of verses from the book of Job to describe the "Savage peoples" of the earth, thus creating a dismal image of their uncivilized state and emphasizing the omnipotence of God, who created such beings: "Stand and behold the marvels of the Lord, who created men who are excluded from humankind, and are many upon the earth.... They eateth grass as an ox and play with the beasts of the field. During the rains, they lay under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed and fens."

Even works by English or French authors were most often translated into Hebrew not from their original languages, but by using mediating texts in German. An inter esting example is offered by Mendelssohn's translation of Young's Night Thoughts, translated, as Gideon Toury has demonstrated, not from the original English version but rather from a German translation of the ballad.4~ Another example of the use of a German mediating text for the translation of an English work may be found in Mordecai Aaron Gunzberg's 1823 Masa' Columbus 'o galut ha- 'arez ha-hadashah. As is well known, the greater part of Gunzberg's book is a translation of Joachim Heinrich Campe's Die Entdeckung von Amerika. But, toward the end of his book Gunzberg added an appendix of sorts, in which he discussed American politics, the issue of slavery, and even the possibility of a Jewish settlement in the "new" continent. This appendix was in fact based on William Robertson's 1777 The History of the Discovery and Settlement of America, but Gunzberg's use of German words throughout the text points to a German mediating text, most probably the anonymously published 42.

In such cases, the text's close proximity to the German version is most evident. Thus, for instance, Ben Elijah explains that the peoples of the North are character ized by black or "TTU rfryi" (gelb broyn) eyes ("ein gelbes, braunes oder ins Schwarze fallendes Aug" in the German version of the book; "jaune, brun, et tirant sur le noir" in Ferry's French), or that the Cape of Good Hope is "ptt osn tmrarii© MTDSn" ("des gutn hofining fargebirges"; "Vorgebiirges der guten Hoff nung" in the German translation; "Cap de Bonne Esperance" in Ferry's original).50 Ben Elijah's Treatment of His Source Text Whether or not Ben Elijah translated Ferry directly or through the mediation of his anonymous German translator, there is no room for doubt in maintaining that he did not translate directly from Buffon's original work but rather from Ferry's adaptation of it. A short comparison among the three texts—Buffon's original, Ferry's adaptation, and Ben Elijah's translation—demonstrates the close proximity between the latter two, while at the same time allowing an initial impression of the differences in the methods, motivations, and self-perceptions of the three authors. 46.

While Baartmann's genitalia were merely a source of eager speculation during her lifetime (only her protruding buttocks were exhibited in early nineteenth-century freak shows), following her death in 1815, her genitals were preserved by the naturalist Georges Cuvier, and until recently they were exhibited at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris.1,2 Buffon's description of the "Hottentot apron" is straightforward and unapologetic. He explained that the "Hottentot" women exhibited a large and wide outgrowth, stemming from just above the pubic bone ("au-dessus de l'os pubis"). This "monstrous deformity" (monstrueuse difformite), explained Buffon, may be viewed by anyone able to garner either the courage or the curiosity to ask the women for a look or a touch.53 Buffon's reportage is of course hardly objective. In the same vein as other contemporary anthropological texts, it is ripe with aesthetic and moral judgments about the peoples, places, and practices it describes. And yet it is evident that Buffon viewed himself as a "serious" man of science and had no reservations about discussing the genitalia of his "subject matter." The same cannot be said about Ferry, let alone Ben Elijah. In Ferry's version, as well as in its German translation, the Sinus pudoris is relocated to a more "neutral" area of the female body, just below the women's navel ("au dessous du nombril"; "unter dem Nabel" ).54 Ferry's mistran slation of Buffon is perhaps understandable, given that the adaptation was intended for children; however, in Ben Elijah's reportage, which was most prob ably not written primarily for children but rather for Jewish readers of all ages, Buffon's "monstrous outgrowth" is domesticated even further and is presented as emerging not from the more "problematic" parts below the navel but straight out of the navel itself: "The [Hottentot] females are smaller than the males, and they have a stiff and wide skin which emerges from the navel and reaches the thighs, and is like an apron to them."

This was not the only instance in which Ben Elijah strayed from his source text. In some cases, the deviations were incidental, stemming, for instance, from a misreading of the source text, from the nature of Ben Elijah's abridged translation, or from the difficulties inherent in translating from a modern language such as German or French into the almost defunct Hebrew of the early nineteenth century. Other times, the deviations were deliberate and were the direct result of Ben Elijah's dissatisfaction with statements made by Buffon and of his conscious decision to alter the text and its meanings. As is most often the case with trans lations, telling these two models of mistranslation apart is, of course, risky business. The difficulty is multiplied given the limited vocabulary at Ben Elijah's disposal, which made it virtually impossible for him to remain faithful to his source text. Similarly to other Hebrew translators of his time, Ben Elijah had no choice but to create his own scientific vocabulary as he went along. The end result was a text filled with ambiguous anthropological, biological, and taxo nomical Hebrew terms. A striking example is afforded by Ben Elijah's translation of Ferry's discus sion of the Sami ("Les Lappons"). Following Buffon's original source text, Ferry and his German translator presented the Sami as a "race" ("une race"; "eine Race") of people of small stature and bizarre figure, "who appear to have degenerated from the human species" (qui paroissent avoir degenere de l'espece humaine; die von den iibrigen ganz ausgeartet zu seyn scheinen) (my emphasis).56 This description was translated by Ben Elijah as follows: In Lapland...we find a species of human beings short in stature and odd in complexion and manners, and these people are excluded from mankind, and are a great many upon the earth. tik» traira o;rnvn»i Drrmai annam troop tra 'in "p» ow...(i3k'?9K1?) psa] 57(my emphasis) [.pxn '35 *717 cm in ,a7N '33 niss 'ksv dto 'ton The differences between the descriptions are easily discernible: while Ferry and his German translator treated the Sami as a "race," Ben Elijah presented them as a "species," and whereas Buffon and his translators explained that these people had "degenerated" into their present constitution, Ben Elijah described them as beings that had deviated from mankind. The difference in terms may appear, prima facie, to indicate a difference in the ideological backgrounds of the authors. At first glance it seems that Ben Elijah wished to convey a polygenis tic message, according to which the Sami were in fact a separate species of human beings, or pseudomen—a notion quite incompatible with Buffon's monogenistic beliefs. Indeed, Buffon was one of the most vocal advocates of monogenism 56. Genie de Buffon, 107; Buffon's Geist, 74. See also Buffon, "Varietes," 223. 57. Gevulot 'arez, la. 310</page><page sequence="17">"Their Eyes Shall Behold Strange Things" during the eighteenth century, claiming that the unity of the human species was clearly proven by the fact that humans of all the various sizes, complexions, and climates were capable of producing fertile offspring.58 And yet, as the century progressed, Buffon's climatic and environmentalist theories of difference, so popular after the first publication of the Histoire Naturelle in 1749, began to lose sway among naturalists. Tura-of-the-century naturalists such as Christoph Meiners, Julian Joseph Virey, and Immanuel Kant began searching for newer, more "objective" ways to account for the differences among men. It was under these circumstances that the modern deterministic understanding of "race" as a biological attribute of men began to assume scientific and cultural significance, and it was not long before polygenism, or the belief in multiple species of human beings that had served during the early modern period mainly as an antic lerical provocation, began to attain a certain scientific prestige.59 In the Jewish literary realm, biological determinism, and, especially, poly genism were vehemently rejected by both maskilim and rabbinic authors alike. Addressing the rising polygenistic trend in 1792, Schnaber Levison, for instance, explained that "[m]any gullible persons have of late claimed that the sun shone on the earth and in her warmth produced [...] many species of very strange men.... And really this is a great gullibility, with which we cannot be bothered."

As explained above, Buffon's monogenistic view of mankind, and his circumstantial under standing of human difference, served the interests of Jewish apologists throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Jewish and Christian authors alike often held an equally dismal view of the present state of their Jewish contemporaries, and the environmental paradigm permitted a certain "optimism" as to the prospects for Jewish "regeneration." For many authors during the period, abandoning this paradigm was tantamount to giving up one of the most fundamental tools in the struggle for the emancipation of the Jews.62 Theology was a further problem. In its fundamental premise that mankind was composed not of one but many species, polygenism was incompatible with the biblical account of the origins of man, according to which God created only a single pair of human beings. This is not to say that all polygenists were atheists. Though polygenism was often linked with anticlericalism and materialism, some polygenists, such as the Scottish philosopher Lord Kames, attempted to reconcile their belief in the multiple origins of man with their Christian faith. Kames postulated that though there was orig inally only one human species, after the fall of the Tower of Babel humankind was divided into various species, each uniquely fitted for a different climate.63 But where did Ben Elijah stand on this issue? In terms of the political hazards of polygenism, Ben Elijah seems to have been far less concerned with the question of Jewish integration in Europe than were his maskilic con temporaries. In fact, in contrast to such Jewish apologists as Isaac De Pinto or Zalkind Hourwitz, who, as noted above, rejected the notion of innate Jewish physical or mental attributes and portrayed the differences between Jews and Christians as resulting from differences in mode of living, Ben Elijah embraced the idea of Jewish uniqueness, and even attempted to uphold it against his source text, Ferry's Biiffon's Geist. In a short chapter discussing the Jews, Ferry explained: It has been claimed that the Jews, who came originally from Syria and Pales tine, have to this day the same brown skin color that they formerly had. However, it is a mistake to claim that all Jews are brown, as this only holds true for the Portuguese Jews. These people always marry among themselves, the children thus resemble their fathers and mothers, and their brown com plexion is perpetuated with little diminution wherever they live, even in the northern countries. 62.

In this sense, Ferry demonstrated what his contemporaries would conceive to be a less "optimistic" view of Jews.65 Ben Elijah took this deviation from Buffon's original a step further and explained that the Jews in general (not only the Portuguese Jews) did not intermarry with other nations and were thus always of a darker complexion than their European compatriots. This message was reinforced in a footnote that accompanied the discussion, in which Ben Elijah once again clarified that "all who observe them recognize that they are descended from the same blessed seed, and say: who is like your people, one nation in the world and one language" (ins -rnK -pra 'a i-mx1! 'n -ypn snr nan rs its"' nrpxn ^si).66 For Ben Elijah then, Jewish physical uniqueness indicated the genealogical "purity" of the Jewish people, and was therefore something in which a Jew is to take pride, not attempt to rationalize. Unlike such Jewish apologists as Zalkind Hourwitz and Isaac De Pinto, who attempted to explain away Jewish uniqueness by turning to climate and customs, Ben Elijah chose to celebrate it. In this respect, whereas pol itical considerations often inspired the maskilic treatment of scientific theories, for Ben Elijah, it was religion that defined which theories would be accepted, and which would be rejected. And indeed, it was also religion in which Ben Elijah's undeniable monogen ism was grounded. Not only did Ben Elijah embrace Buffon's monogenism throughout his translation, often attributing ethnic variations to climate and mode of living, but he also harnessed Jewish theology to support it. Consider, for instance, Ben Elijah's treatment of the following paragraph by Ferry/Buffon: It is clear then that climate is the first and foremost source of skin color. However, diet, which has much less of an effect on color, has a greater effect on the form. Gross, unhealthy, or improperly prepared foods are likely to result in the degeneration of men. And indeed men who subsist on bad food are ugly and deformed. Even among ourselves it is plain to see that country folk are uglier than city folk, and I have often noticed that 64.

The Hebrew translation appears as follows: God created man to live in the divine Garden of Eden, a place protected from heat and cold.... But when God dispersed men throughout the entire earth, and each chose his own climate and multiplied there, their sons varied in looks, stature, and character according to their respective climates and choices of foods. And we have noticed that in the same country the country folk are brutish and thick in nature, and their visages differ from those of the city folk. And since they dispersed over the earth, each chose his own foods and customs and air, and thus their progeny's visages and statures were changed; as noted by Hazal, when Adam was banished from the Garden of Eden, he became shorter and his face was changed.... fan -ia?xai .... mm mpa inaa mpa ''p^x ps pa nrn1? ntf1 mrxn nx Kin rnp'jxn] nxiaa nrra untw naa? lan nsi'x m^px 'x nnb nmi pixn "73 ns bv nmx 'n maBrrn imx nnx runaa irxi i:xsa ^ iran ninin iD17i m^pxn sao^ nnai naipi pxa ntsruw ,T»a mnn pnxa mrcra amis vn mraoa masn mm nan m-1333 Vi B"a3 nnaipi om vt p1? ,mnx tiki ,nnx wuai mx pra V? nna 'x Va 68[....v:s vt n:nwn maip ovarii y":a mx ntutpa It is evident then, that the taxonomic ambiguities in Ben Elijah's translation of Ferry were not the result of any deliberate decision to stray from the source text, but rather stemmed from the unique nature of the Hebrew language of the time and the absence of an accepted scientific lexicon in Hebrew.69 These 67.

It is worth noting that the biological nomenclature of the eighteenth century was character ized by ambiguities not only in Hebrew but also in other languages. Buffon himself tended to use the terms "variety" (variete), "species" (espece), "people" (gens, peuple), and "race" interchangeably. See, e.g., Buffon, "Varietes," 224, 290.

The vast majority of these changes were concerned with theological issues. Ben Elijah's reference to Hazal in his discussion of human variety is indicative of his attempt to legitimize the scientific information put forth in his text by turning to the auth ority of the ancients. On a separate occasion, Ben Elijah also claimed that Abraham Ibn Ezra had already reported the vegetarian practices of the Indian people and that the Gemara mentions many of the islands found in America.7' Another instance occurs in the second chapter of the book, titled Memshelet ha-'adam 'al ba'alei ha-hayim, which is a translation of chapter 21 of Ferry's adaptation of Buffon, titled "Von der Herrschaft des Menschen iiber die Tier." For the most part, Ben Elijah remained faithful to the original text and translated it almost literally, but at the very end of the discussion he inserted a reference to the biblical King Solomon.72 Once again, in this practice Ben Elijah was merely complying with the literary norms of his fellow Hebrew translators during the period, who often used a spoonful of the Jewish canon to help their modern scientific or philosophical ideas go down. Perhaps most famous in this respect was Pinhas Horowitz, who wrote what is now considered to be the first Hebrew encyclopedia, under the pretext of supplying readers with a text to accompany Hayim Vital's She'arei kedushahP The notion that the ancient Jewish sages had been somehow aware of the existence of a fourth continent was also shared by many of Ben Elijah's Jewish contemporaries. Pinhas Horowitz, for example, speculated, following a long standing Jewish tradition, that the biblical land of Ophir is in fact the South Amer ican Peru. This notion was even shared by some maskilim, such as the Polish-born Menahem Mendel Lefin, who stressed the assonance between the words "Ophir" Hudson, "From 'Nation' to 'Race': The Origin of Racial Classification in Eighteenth-Century Thought," Eighteenth-Century Studies 29, no. 3 (1996): 247-64. 70.

Such tactics of "domesticating" trans lated non-Jewish texts were common among Jewish writers of the Haskalah. Hebrew translators such as Lefin, David Zamosc, and Yosef Vitlin tended to clothe their non Jewish source texts in a Jewish garment by "Judaizing," to a greater or lesser degree, names, places, ideas, and language.75 Ben Elijah, however, seems to have taken this practice a step further than his maskilic contemporaries, as he transformed Buffon's materialistic magnum opus into an exceedingly religious text.76 Where Buffon and Ferry avoided using religious explanations for natural phenomena, Ben Elijah simply inserted religion, theology, and acts of God. Admittedly, religious consider ations and motivations often did play a part in the writings of the conservative Enlightenment, both Jewish and Christian, but in most cases theology was merely an appealing addition to the text and did not serve as a legitimate scientific expla nation. Furthermore, when dealing with religiously problematic aspects of their source texts, turn-of-the-century maskilic translators tended to settle for the omission of specific sentences or whole paragraphs and did not normally attempt to turn an overall secular or deistic text into a religious or theistic one. Thus, for example, while translating Campe's narrative on the "discovery" of Palau, Menahem Mendel Lefin had to deal with the following statements appearing in his source text: It is not possible to deduce the absence of religious notions from the absence of external signs of faith. For there is, as I hope my readers know full well, a theology of the heart—the sole theology that is worthy of its sacred name, and which is liberated from external expressions. [Aus dem Mangel an auBeren, in die Sinne fallenden Glaubensgebrauchen lafit sich keinesweges auf den Mangel aller Begriffe dieser Art schlieBen. Denn es gibt ja, wie meine Leser hoffentlich wissen, eine Gotteslehre des Herzens — die einzige, welche ihres heiligen Namens wurdig und die von auBeren Gebrauchen unabhangig ist.]77 74.

In some cases, Ben Elijah used the geographical discussion as a platform for speculating about the whereabouts of the lost Jewish tribes. In one place he claimed, for example, that many of them had been lost in the land of Georgia, and in another he stated that they had reached South America and are in some way responsible for the "higher level of sophistication" exhibited by South Americans.79 The notion that Native Americans were, at least in part, descendants of the lost tribes was popular in both Jewish and Christian literature of the seventeenth century and served as a means of compromising between the "discovery" of the "new" continent and its inhabitants and the biblical worldview.80 This theory continued, to some extent, into the eighteenth and even nine teenth centuries and served as a basis for the American Jewish diplomat Morde cai Manuel Noah's program for the unification of Jews and Native Americans. However, the theory gradually lost its appeal among thinkers of the Jewish as well as the non-Jewish Enlightenments.81 As Richard Popkin explained, during the eighteenth century "ft]he Jewish Indian theory fell victim to a scientific movement aimed at getting rid of the Scriptural framework of human history and substituting a secular one, of migrating people."82 And indeed the "lost tribes" theory played no role in the scientific discussions of major eighteenth century naturalists such as Georges Louis Leclerc Buffon, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Immanuel Kant, and similarly appeared only rarely in the lit erature of the Haskalah.83 78.

Unlike the maskilic translators of his time, Ben Elijah seems to have been less concerned with the scientific or political aspects of his source text and more attentive to its religious messages. But like the maskilim, Ben Elijah was not merely a passive recipient of his source text; he actively adapted and domesti cated the text to better suit his own interests and the needs of his target audience. He mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, gave new meanings to stories and words, and harnessed Buffon's scientific discourse to meet his own theological and ideological agenda. In the process of translation, then, a new text was created, one that was uniquely Jewish and indeed thoroughly tradi tionalistic in character, and yet one that also corresponded with the ideology and translational norms of the Jewish Haskalah and the scientific and naturalistic dis course of the "general" Enlightenment. Buffon, Ben Elijah, and the Vilna Gaon: New Light on an Old Question? The discovery of Ben Elijah's use of Buffon raises once again the much discussed question of the attitude of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century Jewish rabbinic elites toward the Haskalah. What may be gleaned from Ben Elijah's translation of the magnum opus of an anticlerical, perhaps even athe istic thinker of the French Enlightenment? Previous studies have often shown that the new scientific thought of the Enlightenment enjoyed some prestige among the eighteenth-century Jewish religious elite and that notwithstanding the rising ten sions during the late eighteenth century between the Haskalah and the rabbinic elite, some rabbis did not hesitate to use the works of such Jewish or non-Jewish philosophers of the Enlightenment who they perceived to be moderate. Thus, for instance, some maskilim, such as Menahem Mendel Lefm, Isaac Satanov, or even Naphtali Herz Wessely, were used by several nineteenth-century rabbis and talmu dists.84 But whereas the occasional use of conservative maskilim such as Lefin by members of the rabbinic elite is perhaps understandable, Ben Elijah's translation cultural level of a nation. Wessely also used another anthropological-religious theory that was quite archaic during his time, namely the theory that associated the black skin color of the Africans with the biblical curse of Ham.

In fact, it is safe to assume that Ben Elijah was aware not only of Buffon's scientific prestige, but also of his problematic religious status, which was not only notorious during the period but is also self-evident throughout the source text itself, in which reli gion is rarely invoked to sanction scientific speculation. In fact, Ben Elijah could easily have chosen to translate some other natural-history book, one more conser vative in nature, such as Linneaus's Systema Naturae, throughout which the author's adherence to the religious worldview is evident.86 And yet it appears that Ben Elijah strove to translate what he justifiably understood to be the arch text of eighteenth-century natural history. In this choice to translate an important scientific text in spite of its author's deistic and anticlerical leanings, Ben Elijah conforms to the tendency, found in many maskilic translations during his time, to translate the writings of deists or materialists such as Benjamin Franklin or even anti-Jewish thinkers such as Voltaire or Goethe.87 It implies an ideology that values the content, theme, and literary or scientific merit of the text over the name of its author, his attitude toward Jews, or his religious convictions.88 Indeed, Ben Elijah's choice to translate Buffon reinforces the arguments made by contemporary scholars such as David Assaf or Yehoshua Mondshein, who claim that the Lithuanian mitnagdim of the late eighteenth century embraced an ideology of "accepting the truth from whatever source it comes." According to Assaf and Mondshein, a close affinity existed between the Lithuanian mitnagdim and the Haskalah, and the radical rejection of the Haskalah originated not from the mitnagdim but rather from hasidic circles.89 Finally, Ben Elijah's Gevulot 'are: may shed some light on a related scho larly controversy surrounding the Vilna Gaon's attitude toward the question of secular studies. Ever since the eighteenth centuiy, two mutually exclusive images of the Gaon have existed in both the research community and the 85.

The first is the image of the Gaon as an ardent supporter of secular studies or, at times, even a harbinger of the Haskalah in his own right. This image made its initial appearance in a 1780 translation of Euclid by the maskilic rabbi Baruch Schick of Shklov. In the preface to the translation, Schick claimed that the Gaon had instructed him "to translate whatever possible of the secular sub jects into our holy tongue in order to recover what they [the Gentiles] had devoured, so that they will spread through the land and knowledge should prolifer ate among our people of Israel."90 The image of the Gaon as a supporter of the secular studies was further propagated by other conservative maskilim such as Samson Bloch or Shmuel Yosef Fiinn, who attempted to legitimize the Haskalah project by turning to the authority of great Jewish sages such as the Gaon.91 There is, however, an altogether different image of the Gaon as an extremely conserva tive member of the Jewish religious elite and a vehement opponent of secular studies. This image of the Gaon also originates in the eighteenth century, during which rumors circulated that the Gaon had ordered the public burning of copies of Wesseley's Divrei shalom ve- 'emet in Vilna.92 These two opposing images of the Gaon were tailored to meet the needs of two opposing camps during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The conser vative Haskalah attempted to legitimize the pursuit of secular knowledge by iden tifying precedents for such pursuits in the thought and writings of such canonical thinkers as the Gaon, while their opponents, who viewed the Haskalah as an assimilatory and secularizing force within Judaism, attempted to purge the image of the Gaon of any affinity with the maskilic ideology.93 To some extent, the image of the Gaon continues to serve as an ideological battleground between liberal historians and ultraorthodox scholars today. In recent years, however, there has been a growing scholarly tendency to view the Gaon as less tolerant toward secular studies than maskilim such as Fiinn would have us believe. Perhaps the most important work in this respect is Immanuel Etkes's 1980 study of the Gaon. Etkes casts serious doubts as to the Gaon's positive 90.

Now, while we have no reason to doubt Rabbi Barukh's word, neither do we have any reason or justification to generalize and infer that the Ga'on enjoined his disciples to translate secular texts."94 Other studies still maintain that the Gaon held a positive attitude toward secular studies, and it appears that the ques tion of the Gaon's attitude toward both the Haskalah and secular studies remains open.95 Even Etkes agrees that the trend to combine secular and religious studies, prevalent among some of the great sage's disciples, is an "interesting cultural trend [that] deserves thorough research into its nature and salient features, as well as the extent and depth of its influence."96 The discovery of the translation of Buffon by the Gaon's most ardent disci ple, his son Abraham, is perhaps a step in this direction. The fact that Ben Elijah took it upon himself to translate the most canonical natural-history text of the Enlightenment and while doing so embraced many of the maskilic translational norms of the period constitutes further evidence that the Gaon did indeed urge his disciples to become acquainted with the new intellectual trends of their time and to propagate secular knowledge in a Judaized form, through Hebrew trans lations.97 This is not to say, of course, that the Gaon or his son were either harbin gers or members of the Haskalah movement. While Ben Elijah embraced some maskilic translational norms, he rejected many other important ones. And whereas for the maskilim the scientific content and political message of the text were paramount, for Ben Elijah the chief concern was religious. However, the dis covery of Ben Elijah's source text exposes some surprising intercultural contacts between the Lithuanian mitnagdim and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, suggesting an openness to secular knowledge that far exceeds anything seen among the Gaon's disciples to date.
