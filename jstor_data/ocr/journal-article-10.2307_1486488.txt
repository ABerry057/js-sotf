<plain_text><page sequence="1">Margerete Schltiter. Auf welche Weise wurde die Mishnah geschrieben? Texts and Studies in Medieval and Early Modem Judaism 9. Ttibingen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1993. x , 389, 70* pp. Iggeret Rav Sharira Ga 'on is, of course, our primary source for the chronology of the talmudic period, and one of our most important early discussions of the redactional history of the Mishnah; its influence on the direction of modern research into these topics has been pervasive. The importance of a reliable critical edition for this text is thus even greater than usual, and that role has, since 1921, been filled by B. M. Lewin's work, which presents the text in two versions, the so-called "French" and "Spanish" recensions, which differ in several vital respects. However, the determination of the provenance of available manuscripts and witnesses was based primarily on one variant-whether the text ascribed</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 181 the writing or merely the redaction of the Mishnah to Rabbi, in accordance with the opinion of Maimonides, or to Rashi-without further substanti- ation. Indeed, Lewin himself considered an Aleppo manuscript written in "Sephardic" script as the best representative of the French recension. Indeed, I. Elbogen considered this determination without foundation ("daftir fehlt jede Unterlage," quoted in Schltiter, p. 18). This is not merely a question of terminology, but one which touches on the usefulness of the critical apparatus and stemmatics of the text. Thus, in the intervening seventy years, various scholars, from Y. N. Epstein to Y. Gafni, have called for a new critical edition. Such an edition, as Margerete Schltiter notes, is not without difficulty, not least because of the difficulty of gaining access to important manuscripts, or even microfilm copies of them (see p. 20). SchlUter thus decided to base her "edition" on two of the witnesses which were available to her, and which are reproduced in facsimile in the back-matter-MS Berlin, representing the French recension (now the "B-recension"), and the text published in 1566 in Constantinople by Abraham Zacuto as part of his Sefer ha-Yuhasin (now the "Y-recension"), representing the Spanish recension. As it happens, the Berlin manuscript, chosen out of necessity, turns out to be the oldest (eleventh century, two centuries earlier than Y. N. Epstein's estimate) and best, based on a new examination by M. Beit-Aries and a new (computer-based) collation of this text with others. In the end she concludes, with Elbogen and Epstein, that the B-recension is indeed the superior of the two (p. 367). The body of her book is thus an annotated translation of these two texts, with text-critical notes when necessary. While this arrangement does not take the place of a full critical edition, a goal which is at present apparently impossible of realization, it provides modern scholars with a measured advance over Lewin's text, though for the foreseeable future Lewin's edition will still have to be examined. Moreover, as J. Neusner has often pointed out, a translation has advantages which merely reproducing the original text lacks: readers can easily see for themselves the translator's interpretation of the text. Unfortunately, it is not possible to measure the extent of the advance SchlUter has made in the ongoing attempt to produce a new critical edition, since a stemma cannot be drawn, given the aforementioned unavailability of a number of manuscripts. However, since she provides the Hebrew or Aramaic</page><page sequence="3">182 BOOK REVIEWS for those manuscripts available to her, readers will find her text-critical remarks quite useful in difficult passages (see, for example, n. 8 on p. 52). While the notes do not generally present new understandings of the text, they often present the status questionis in convenient capsule form (see, for example, n. 19 on pp. 44-45). Cross-references to Lewin's edition are to be found in the margins; further references in the facsimile editions to Schltiter's paragraphing allow easier resort to the back-matter. As far as the text-critical notes are concerned, they are always to the point, and represent a level-headed approach to the questions raised, often clearing away the detritus of past polemics on many important issues (see, for example, n. 1 on p. 68 and the extended discussion on pp. 323-325). However, the wider implications of the notes must be sought in the "Literarischer Kommentar" which follows the translation and covers the first sixty-eight paragraphs of the Iggeret in Schliiter's numbering (to Lewin, p. 34), namely, that part of the Letter which deals with the Mishnah. It should be noted that Schltiter carried forward her work of analysis in a paper given at the Eleventh World Congress in Jerusalem, and which has just been published in its proceedings, "Ha-Baraytot bi-tshuvato shel Ray Sharira Ga'on le-'anshei Keiruwan." One of the most important features of Schltiter's work is her "literary commentary," which, following A. Weiss's important pioneering observations in his 1943 book, Le-Hithavvut ha-Talmud ha-Bavli bi-Sheleimuto (see p. 14 of the present work), examines the structure of the work, with particular emphasis on the sequence of arguments and the way in which the body of the Letter seeks to answer questions raised at its outset. Thus, for example, see SchlUiter's discussion regarding the generally accepted emendation of rabbeinu (referring to Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi) to rabbanan (referring to the "rabbis" in general) in her par. 30 (see Lewin, p. 18, 11. 5 f.), on which hangs the question of whether R. Sherira held the view that the Mishnah was not reduced to writing until the end of Rabbi's life or until the end of the rabbinic period. Schltiter notes that, aside from the fact that all the MSS of the Y-recension read the first, and many of the B- as well, the superiority of that reading is confirmed by its conformity with the question posed in par. 5 (Lewin, p. 5,11. 15-16). These "global" considerations often guide her text-critical comments, and masterfully combine a minute examination of the text with an understanding of its structure and purpose. In this particular case, a feeling for R. Sherira's language and style also guides the discussion. Schltiter prefers the more "conservative" (in terms of</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 183 the history of religions question) reading, and in the end determines that either reading most probably refers to Rabbi's generation in any case. On her reading, therefore, R. Sherira refers to compilation or reduction to writing in Rabbi's lifetime rather than to the classic rabbinic period as a whole. However, her nuanced interpretation of the ambiguity of R. Sherira's use of the word katav, which may refer to "composition" or "reduction to writing," throws open the whole question once again (see n. 1 on pp. 322-323, and also her observations on p. 325). Whatever R. Sherira understands Rabbi's contribution to be is still not certain, though it is certain that he was here referring to Rabbi's generation and no other. This is not the end of the matter, however, since Schluiter examines the differing viewpoints on this matter implicit in the two recensions. While both concentrate on Rabbi's generation, the Y-recension describes as well the condition of tannaitic learning of the generations before. Moreover, in its pluses as against the B-recension (which Schltiter sees as having been taken from par. 14), it stresses the general agreement of earlier generations on substantive matters, despite the plurality of formulations. The lack of these pluses in the B-recension Schltiter takes as evidence of its superiority, especially in light of its conformity with the question raised in par. 5 (see above). If this is so, then R. Sherira does not here proffer a history of tannaitic literature. Moreover, the following paragraphs therefore continue the discus- sion regarding Rabbi's generation and the previous one, but not those of the "early rabbis." Aside from these considerations, Schltiter consistently examines the sequence of argumentation and the proofs, both explicit and implicit, on which R. Sherira bases his argument. Thus, R. Sherira's determination that tannaitic teachings were not only not written down before Rabbi, but not even formulated in a universally accepted way, is not founded on any particular source in rabbinic literature, but proceeds ineluctably from the very fact that the exigencies of such transmission led to the loss of halakhot (p. 325). Schltiter is alive to the differences in view between the two recensions on this matter, and elucidates each on its own. On the other hand, she notes those cases in which the source cited does not altogether carry the meaning imputed to it; see, for example, her analysis of the use of m. Ed. 1:3 in par. 35 (Lewin, p. 19; see SchlUiter, p. 327). Though she is alive to the possibility that these and other inconnicities are due to later editing of the Letter, and do</page><page sequence="5">184 BOOK REVIEWS not stem from R. Sherira himself, these cases become very important in her evaluation of the Letter as an historical source (see below). It is through openness to such ambiguities and complexities that an accurate understanding of the contribution of our text to important historical questions may be gained. Moreover, her focus on the Letter does not impell her to confuse a determination of R. Sherira's intent with historical truth (see her comment on p. 323). As we shall see, the net result of her study of this matter is to turn attention back to a study of the characteristics of the Mishnah itself. However, a pervasive literalness often causes her to miss the text's possibilities and (perhaps) R. Sherira's understanding of his sources. For example, in her discussion of R. Sherira's first formulation of his answer (par. 12, Lewin, p. 7; see Schltiter's analysis, pp. 296-297), she points to the astonishing ("erstaunlich") discrepancy between R. Sherira's source in the Bavli and the argument he presents, since b. Yeb. 64b reports that the Mishnah was redacted "in Rabbi's day," while R. Sherira asserts, on the basis of that source, that Rabbi himself was the redactor. However, Schltiter misses the hierarchal nature of the reasoning common to both R. Sherira and his interlocutors: if the redaction was accomplished in Rabbi's day, who but Rabbi was the most appropriate person to have directed the work, and with whom ultimate credit and responsibility lie? If such was the clear implication of the text for R. Sherira and his correspondents, there is no need to require an explicit statement ("ein klare Aussage") of Rabbi's role, as she demands on p. 298. Furthermore, given this mode of thought, her speculations regarding alternative interpretations for R. Sherira's are unnecessary. Again, in her discussion of pars. 32-36 (Lewin, pp. 18-19), she discerns a "sloppiness" in R. Sherira's use of sources and even a certain loss of sequence in his own chronological description, which leads her to consider whether the quotations and formulas are not actually his but an early addition to the text by a-presumably-sloppy editor. In commenting on the use of m. Ed. 1:3, which in passing notes the necessity of transmitting one's master's teaching in his style (bi-lshon rabbo), she notes that R. Sherira wishes to emphasize the need to transmit teachings in the name of the one from whom they were received. However, since R. Sherira has already noted that R. Eliezer b. Yaakov's style was qav ve-naqi, and thus characteristic of the man, we may assume that here too the phrase bi-lshon rabbo has the implication (for R. Sherira) that once the style is maintained, the identification can be made,</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 185 especially in conjunction with the knowledge of who the tradent's teachers were. We need not even go so far, since one of the examples given in m. Ed. 1:3 concerns a tradition reported in the names of Shemaya and Abtalion, and the importance of that report, thus confirming R. Sherira's point. Furthermore, even without m. Ed .1:3, which may or may not have been exactly what the context required, b. Meg 15a was easily available to R. Sherira, and it states exactly what he wanted to say, that (since one thereby "brings redemption to the world") one ought to transmit teachings in the name of the one who said them. This all being the case, speculations about early editors, or imputations of a pervasive sloppiness in R. Sherira's use of sources, seem out of place. Such sloppiness would seem to be self-defeating, unless it was in consonance with the interpretative mode of the time, and if it were, we no longer need speak of "sloppiness"! Likewise, Schlifter's strictures regarding R. Sherira's temporary loss of sequence in par. 36, where he speaks of the source-critical concerns of the rabbis after the redaction of the Mishnah in the same breath as before, may themselves be out of place, since, once some mishnayot are transmitted anonymously, whether before or after the Mishnah's redaction, the need to ferret out their authors is constant. R. Sherira does not need apologists for his interpretations and his ar- guments; what is required is a sympathetic reading, which is more likely than an adversive reading to arrive at an understanding of his modes of argumentation. In the end, a modern historian may decide, as SchlUter in fact does, that his interpretations cannot be sustained on the basis of a critical reading of the sources to which he adverts. But first we must understand what he himself intended, without resorting--except in the last resort-to imputations of a slovenly use of sources. R. Sherira was not, after all, a first-year graduate student finding his or her footing in the literature. He was dealing with matters of first-rate importance, and writing to men who were presumably competent scholars. In the end, while SchlUter discounts a provable anti-polemic intent in R. Sherira's composition (see pp. 2-4), her analysis of his arguments and, more important, the sources and proof-texts for his reconstruction of the history of the Oral Torah leads her to conclude, with A. Weiss and against S. Abramson, that R. Sherira had no non-talmudic sources (e.g., amoraic or gaonic records) which could shed light on the questions he discusses. The Letter reflects his own personal view, based on talmudic sources. As SchlUter</page><page sequence="7">186 BOOK REVIEWS puts it, "sein Schreiben is daher absolute ungeeignet und . . . unbrauchbar als historische Quelle fuer die Enstehung der rabbinischen Literatur und darf somit in keiner Weise mehr fuer die Rekonstruktion der Literaturgeschichte in Anspruch genommen werden-vielmehr ist es selber Gegenstand einer solchen Geschichte" ("His work is thus absolutely unsuited and ... unusable as an historical source for the rise of rabbinic literature and must in no way be claimed as a source for the reconstruction of the literary history; it is rather a subject for such a historical study") (p. 372). It should, however, be remembered that this unequivocal verdict is based on Schltiter's analysis of only part of the Iggeret; it refers to her reconstruction of the redaction of the Mishnah, and is also based on the types of overliteral readings I discussed above. The last word has yet to be spoken on these matters. Yaakov Elman Yeshiva University New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
