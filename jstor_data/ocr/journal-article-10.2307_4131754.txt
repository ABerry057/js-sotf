Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2001. 195 pp. The author, an Israeli folklorist who teaches at the University of Haifa, has had the excellent idea of scrutinizing the various "legends of origin" of Polish Jew- ry. She makes use of works by Hebrew and Yiddish authors, published in modern times but based on folk material of considerable antiquity, and of materials col- lected by ethnographers of pre-Holocaust Jewish Eastern Europe and by re- searchers in Israel. Her linguistic skills are admirable (she discusses material in German and Polish as well as both Jewish languages), and her book, while it does not altogether avoid professional jargon, is definitely accessible to the nonspe- cialist. This short volume is divided into five chapters. The first chapter discusses "name midrashim," that is, stories that derive the very name of Poland from the Hebrew words po-lin, meaning "dwell here." The second deals with "legends of acceptance," that have to do with the various ways in which the Jews were greet- ed on their arrival by their Polish hosts. In this case the author detects two models: one emphasizing the close and friendly relations between Jews and Poles and the other placing more emphasis on the voluntary segregation of the Jews from their non-Jewish neighbors. Chapter 3 is devoted to tales concerning Abraham Pro- chownik, the Jewish gunpowder merchant whom the ninth-century Poles wished to make their king, and Chapter 4 takes up the story of Esterke, the legendary mis- tress or wife of the fourteenth-century king, Casimir the Great. Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the various legends that grew up around the founding of Polish syna- gogues. Bar-Itzhak believes that these legends of origin have much to teach us about Jewish attitudes towards their own community and toward the country in which they lived, and she succeeds in convincing the reader. Indeed, as a historian I can only welcome the author's important observation that these ancient legends have evolved over time, that they have meant different things to different generations of Polish Jews, and that the published versions of these legends must be understood in their proper historical and social context. This context, however, is not always fully demarcated. Bar-Itzhak is surely right to insist that the version of the Jews' first arrival in Poland published in 1861 by Marek Dubs in the Jewish-Polish jour- nal Jutrzenka reflects this journal's integrationist stance and its desire to empha- size the amicable and mutually beneficial aspects of the early relations between Jews and Poles, but she does not tell us very much about the "integrationist camp" then emerging within Galician and Russian-Polish Jewry. Nor am I convinced that the eighteenth-century Galician memoirist Dov Ber of Bolech6w (here rendered Bolichow), who published a version of this story that promotes the "segregation- ist model" of early Polish-Jewish coexistence, should be called a maskil (46). She is, however, surely right to read all of these legends as, among other things, a species of Jewish apologetics. In her summary she notes that they served to bestow a "spiritual and religious stamp of approval to the very act of settlement in and con- tinued presence in Poland" to demonstrate the Jewish presence on Polish soil since 392</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews time immemorial, emphasize the important Jewish contributions to the welfare of the Polish state (including the Jews' magical ability to insure the proper amount of rain), and point out that good relations had existed between the "hosts" and their "guests," although these relations soured over time (159). The author devotes a good deal of space to a close reading of the reworking of some of these tales by Shmuel Yosef Agnon, the great Galician-born Hebrew writer. This seems, at first glance, a rather unexpected exercise for a folklorist- Agnon, after all, was a highly sophisticated author and an impeccable represen- tative of Jewish "high culture," not exactly a representative of the "folk." None- theless, Bar-Itzhak's analysis of his renditions of the legends of Polish Jewry constitutes, for this reader, the highlight of her book. We are shown how Agnon, while basing himself on the ancient tales, subverts them by suggesting in various subtle ways that Jews and Poles were not destined to live together in harmony, and that the only proper course for modern Polish Jewry was to seek redemption in the Land of Israel. In other words, Agnon rejected the idea-suggested in the name of midrashim-that Poland was a sacred space for Jews and imparts to the various legends a Zionist sensibility. As far as he is concerned, "the pact [between Jews and Poles] is likely to be breached because of the disparity between pagan Polish materialism and the Jewish view that real life depends upon the life of the spirit" (85). His version of the Esterke story-according to which the king of Poland fell madly in love with a simple Jewish girl and, as a result, treated his Jewish subjects with exemplary generosity-makes the same point. We have here, then, another fascinating example of how the ideological bent of the teller of the tale informs the tale itself, bending it to his particular world view-"segregationist" in the case of the traditionalist Dov Ber of Bolech6w, "integrationist" in the case of Dubs, and Zionist in the case of Agnon. The book is enhanced by a large number of interesting illustrations, although it must be said that not all of them are closely related to the text. The artistic rep- resentation of the arrival of the Jews in Poland and the Esterke story were themes taken up by several prominent Polish artists of Jewish origin, including Aleksander Lesser and Maurycy Gottlieb. On the Polish side, no less a figure than Jan Matekjo, the greatest representative of nineteenth-century nationalist art, devoted a re- markable and highly idiosyncratic canvas to the "reception of the Jews in Poland" in 1096, in which a Jewish delegation to the court of Wiadyslaw Herman in Plock is led by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela! An analysis of the visual rendi- tions of these "legends of origins" would no doubt serve as a fascinating supple- ment to Bar-Itzhak's analyses of the texts. For the time being, we can be grateful to her for demonstrating that these stories have much to teach us about the inter- nal world of Polish Jewry.
