Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992. xiv, 346 pp. Mark Levene's War, Jews, and the New Europe: The Diplomacy of Lucien Wolf 1914-1919 illuminates a critical episode in an unconventional discipline, pre-1948 Jewish diplomatic history. Herein lies the great strength of the book: Levene does not treat his subject like a normative segment of diplomatic history; he is sensitive to the facts that there was no army or government backing up Lucien Wolf (1857-1930), and that any impact he might possibly have made must be seen as extraordinary. Levene harbors no illusion that Wolf, who is principally remembered as a publicist and historian, was a "statesman" or even a "statesman without a state." Wolf emerges as a self-styled advocate for East European Jewry who also was moved (to a lesser degree) by what he saw as British interests. In the context of Anglo-Jewish history, Levene's study offers a fresh appraisal of events covered, at least in part, by scholars such as Sharman Kadish, David Cesarani, Louise London, Tony Kushner,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 241 Geoffrey Alderman, Eugene Black, and Stuart Cohen. With respect to Zionism in particular, the book complements, and to a certain extent corrects, David Vital's Zionism: The Crucial Phase (1987). Both agree, however, that it was "psychological delusions about the Jews, rather than the economic and social realities of the Jewish question, [that] gave an underdeveloped Jewish diplomacy its great opportunity" during the Great War (Levene, p. 311). Especially in light of the expressly Zionist perspectives of Vital and of Jehuda Reinharz in Chaim Weizmann: The Making of a Statesman (1993), Levene achieves an impressive critical distance from his subject, and this will possibly place his work among the more authoritative interpretations in the long run. Levene's convincing central argument is a counterweight to the superficial, yet nevertheless prevalent judgment that Wolf "lost" to Weizmann and the Zionists and therefore became something of a relic. Although the Balfour Declaration of 1917 represented a stupendous achievement for Zionism, Lucien Wolf played a decisive role as Jewish policies were forged in the postwar settlement. To say the least, he did not leave the scene. Although it is typically assumed that the postwar Minorities Treaties were largely a result of agreements reached between Louis Marshall and David Hunter Miller, or between Marshall and Manley Hudson, Levene shows that the main players were Wolf and James Headlam-Morley-and why this is important (p. 290). The problem, however, which Levene squarely recognizes, is that Wolf-similar to his Zionist counterparts-drastically underestimated the violent potency of the nationalisms unleased by the Great War. In many respects Wolf remained a gentleman of the nineteenth century, who could never have adjusted his sights to fit the paranoid fantasies that would eventually consume European Jewry. The book follows and analyzes Wolf's diplomacy as he navigates his way through Jewish, British, and European politics beginning with the First World War. Although Levene puts Wolf under the microscope, he is careful not to exaggerate his impact. He shows that Wolf advanced his cause not only from skillful diplomatic maneuvering and a command of a vast amount of information, but because of misperceptions on the part of British and other non-Jewish officials-who tended to see "world Jewry" as a far more powerful entity than it actually was. Levene deftly undermines the traditional and hackneyed differentiation between "nationalists" and "antinationalists," Zionists and so-called assimilationists. He shows, instead, the significant and</page><page sequence="3">242 BOOK REVIEWS complex overlap in their views and proposals. Although Wolf's "opponents" obviously gained the upper hand during the war, the "loss" to the Zionists was neither as striking nor as permanent as much of the historiography indicates. Indeed, the Balfour Declaration represented a policy that necessarily evolved, and Wolf even had a part in its evolution. Despite the author's empathy for his subject, he does not make Wolf into a plaster saint. At best he is a tragic hero, capable of "a colossal error of judgement" (p. 310). In part due to his inability to find a means of working with Louis Marshall, Wolf's input into the Minorities Treaties was not as forceful and effective as it might have been. Levene informs us why the agreements were not "on paper the best solution that has been dreamt of," as Wolf claimed. . while the first seven clauses of the treaty did provide Jews and other minorities with watertight clauses which fixed them "more firmly and explicitly in the nationality of the lands of their birth than they had ever been before"-a signal defeat for the Zionists-these clauses might have been strengthened still further if Wolf had heeded that section of the American Jewish Bill of Rights which proposed provisions for Jews expelled, or Jews who had fled, to return and claim full citizenship rights. No such stipulation appeared in the Joint Foreign Committee formula or final text of the treaty, and in consequence Wolf was faced with thousands of Jewish stateless refugees in post-war Eastern Europe quite unprotected by the Minorities Treaty. (p. 300) In this superb study, one of the few areas which might merit clarification or reconsideration is the author's treatment of the American-Jewish delegation at Versailles. There seems to be a piece of the puzzle missing involving the connection, or even the perception of the connection, between Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis-which is also absent in most other accounts. Overall, however, Levene's research and judgments are meticulous without being pedantic. He manages to be sympathetic to Wolf, immersing himself in his worldview, while being able to step outside of Wolf's shoes and survey the wider political and social landscape. Levene in the end has used subtlety and imagination to produce an immensely valuable book, which will be of interest to scholars in Anglo-Jewish history, East European Jewish history and politics, Zionist history, diplomatic history, and those interested in the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 243 eternally gray zone between peoples, ethnic groups, and publicly recognized nations while the world is crashing down.
