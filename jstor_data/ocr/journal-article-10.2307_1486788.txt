<plain_text><page sequence="1">Menachem Fisch. Rational Rabbis: Science and Talmudic Culture. Bloom- ington: Indiana University Press, 1997. xxii, 263 pp. The central claim of this book is that the Talmud gives voice to an epistemology and a style of reasoning not very different from those underlying modem science. The author begins by working out his own philosophy of science on the basis of Karl Popper's idea that scientific hypotheses can be refuted but not proven. Fisch depicts science as working by progressive troubleshooting: scientists know that today's regnant theories may be sup- planted tomorrow, but this awareness does not degenerate into relativism or conventionalism because careful method allows the body of knowledge to grow and not simply change. Science advances by continually improving its approximation of reality, even though its grasp of reality will never get past the approximate, and even though we can never really know which features of that approximation will finally have to be altered or discarded. Fisch then abruptly shifts to the world of talmudic Judaism, where he finds two competing ideologies of Torah. The "traditionalist" view holds that authentic tradition is the only valid basis for judging the legitimacy of a teaching. Rules or opinions, once acknowledged as based on authentic tradition, can never be set aside or changed: one may challenge the pedigree of such teachings, but never their content. The "antitraditionalist" school, however, insists that all received teachings must constantly be reevaluated in the light of new developments and new ways of thinking; viewpoints universally accepted in one generation can be nullified in another if later authorities see fit to replace them. The traditionalist view must therefore see halakhic development as no more than the application of received teaching to unanticipated situations, while the other approaches Torah the way scientists approach the world, with a method of progressive troubleshooting that is always ready to alter received norms when new defects are detected in them, or even to start the tradition down a previously uncharted course when</page><page sequence="2">440 BOOK REVIEWS this seems desirable. To Fisch, this readiness to test and improve received knowledge is the essence of rational behavior; hence the title of his book. Fisch demonstrates that ancient rabbinic literature gives voice to both these points of view. By comparing parallel versions of well-known stories, he shows that the Mishnah tends to reveal an antitraditionalist mindset, while the Tosefta presents the same materials in a traditionalist frame. Fisch notes, however, that the open battles over issues that characterize the Yavneh stories are pretty much absent from depictions of later generations; he claims that the Babylonian Talmud reveals a strong commitment to antitraditionalism but conceals this commitment behind a traditionalist facade. In Fisch's view, the strategy backfired; later ages read the Talmud itself as a traditionalist text, and mistakenly adopted its apparent resistance to innovation and change as the hallmark of Jewish piety. This review will not presume to judge the philosophy of science laid out in Part I of the book. With respect to Part II, the great strength of Fisch's work is the quality of his close readings. Fisch examines his selected texts with unremitting care and brings out inner voices that could easily be missed. By tracing the unstated presuppositions that underlie these sugyot, rather than their overt content, he identifies an ideological rift that traverses all of rabbinic literature but is usually concealed by harmonization. Readers have long sensed that the Talmud has no uniform stance on the issue of tradition and innovation, and Fisch has provided a sustained, coherent account of this uncertainty and its origin. This contribution is most welcome. The book's weaknesses are two, of which the first is style. The writing in this volume is all too frequently dense and graceless. Words are often misused, sentences ungrammatical. This book says important things, but the author was not well served by his editors, and the book should not have gone to print in its present form. Second, this reviewer remained unconvinced about the relationship be- tween the two parts of the book. It may be true that (some) talmudic rabbis and (some) modem scientists think in similar patterns, but what does this prove? Fisch admits that other rabbis, and other scientists, view these matters differently, and he is also careful to avoid any suggestion of a historical link between his two cases of "rationality." Is anything left, then, other than superficial coincidence? Furthermore, is there not an important difference in the data these "ratio- nal" thinkers handle? Scientific data are in principle obtained by observation from a world the scientist did not make; the act of observation can affect</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 441 data, but it does not generate its own objects. Rabbinic thinking, however, by the rabbis' own admission, is mostly about previous rabbinic thinking; its roots in a moment of extrarabbinic revelation are, again by the rabbis' own admission, of dubious practical consequence (bBM 59b). Does not this self-referential quality of rabbinic teaching have some bearing on the question under discussion? This is a matter that Fisch never addresses, but this reader could not get it out of his mind. Robert Goldenberg State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
