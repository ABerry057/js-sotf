<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gary Phillip Zola. Isaac Harby of Charleston, 1788-1828: Jewish Reformer and Intellectual. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1994. xv, 284 pp. This is the first full-length study of Isaac Harby since 1931; it is an outgrowth of Gary Phillip Zola's 1991 doctoral dissertation, which utilized newly discovered primary sources and is likely to remain for a long time the definitive work on Harby, barring any additional unearthings. Harby was descended from Iberian Jews expelled from Spain in 1492, who first emigrated to Morocco and then to England several centuries later. Harby's father went to Jamaica in 1778, moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1781, married a Sephardic woman in 1782, worked as a butcher and later as an auctioneer, and died in 1805, leaving a widow and seven children, of whom Isaac, at sixteen, was the oldest. Up to the time of this family misfortune, young Harby had enjoyed the fruits of an excellent secular education in the classical tradition of the day, acquiring a reading proficiency in Latin, Greek, and French. Intellectually oriented, Harby was a bibliophile who amassed a library of over 200 books on history, classical literature, poetry, drama, criticism, and religion. Though he worked briefly as an apprentice in a law office, Harby forsook a legal career for a lifetime (short, as it turned out) of teaching, newspaper commentary, publishing, and occasional playwriting. He became very active in Charleston's intellectual circle, launching a literary journal at age eighteen, "quite likely the first ... by a Jew in the United States" (p. 31); its failure did not discourage him from subsequent ventures as editor and publisher. At twenty-two Harby established a private academy, his most successful enterprise, though he continued journalistic writing on a variety of subjects, including politics. Like most American young men of his generation, he supported the Jeffersonian Republicans, but, like his fellow South Carolinian John C. Calhoun, he</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 201 espoused nationalistic policies during and after the War of 1812. Harby must have been thrilled when President James Monroe, traveling through the South in his first term, visited Charleston in 1819 and attended a performance of his play Alberti. The two men may even have met. In the last decade of his life, Harby continued to do what he enjoyed most, writing, lecturing, and teaching, first at his own academy, then at one of Charleston's public schools, and finally, in 1828, at his private school in New York City. It was Harby's bad luck that, for all his ambition to succeed in the world of high culture, Charleston's post-1815 economic downturn brought about a parallel decline in the city's cultural life, one of the reasons he left it to go north. Zola recognizes Harby's stature as a litterateur, but his biography focuses ultimately on his subject's relationship to Judaism, and herein lies the book's most fascinating contribution to American Jewish history. Harby, like his father, stayed mostly on the periphery of Charleston's Jewish community and its main Sephardic synagogue, Congregation Beth Elohim (though father and son did marry Jewish women). How, then, to explain Isaac Harby's leading role in organizing, in 1824, Charleston's Reformed Society of Israelites, the obvious harbinger of what became Reform Judaism in America? This well-written, lucidly analyzed book, in the absence of much hard evidence, posits some very plausible theses. Harby was reacting to a discernible increase in Christian missionizing among American Jews, and he saw in such activity religious intolerance toward his fellow Jews, who should not have had to be subjected to the triumphalism of evangelists. Also, a contemporary debate over the "Maryland Jew Bill" undoubtedly convinced Harby that greater gentile acceptance of Jews would result from a new, modernized, reason-based, universalistic Judaism. Furthermore, it is quite likely that Harby had learned about the Jewish liturgical reforms in post-Napoleonic Europe that had been one response to Jewish emancipation there, for by way of contrast, he deprecated the way Judaism was taught and practiced at Beth Elohim. Harby's early, futile plans to reform Judaism needed an Isaac Mayer Wise and others, who were much more successful later in the century. Still, Harby's contributions deserve to be made available to students of American Jewish history. Zola is to be commended for his scholarship, not only on this early phase of Reform Judaism, but on the negative reactions of other Jewish educators at the time, such as Jacob Mordecai (a former business partner of Haym Salomon's), whose biting criticism presaged the</page><page sequence="3">202 BOOK REVIEWS late-nineteenth-century rejection of Reform Judaism by Sabato Morais, a founder of Conservative Judaism, and the Orthodox Jewish leadership.
