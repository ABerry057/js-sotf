<plain_text><page sequence="1">Solomon Grayzel. The Church and the Jews in the XIIIth Centuty. Volume 2, 1254-1314. Edited and arranged, with additional notes, by Kenneth R. Stow. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1989. xxiii, 357 pp. Fifty years after its first publication, Solomon Grayzel's The Church and the Jews in the XIIIth Century (Philadelphia, 1933; rev. ed. 1966) remains the essential sourcebook on its subject. The present volume, substantially completed by Grayzel before his death in 1980, represents the long-awaited second volume to his great work, carrying the collection forward from 1254 (when the 1933 edition ended) to 1314. English summaries of Latin sources have taken the place of the full translations offered in vol. 1, a change necessitated by the increasing volume of the surviving material, and the notes have been moved from the bottom of the page to the end of each document; but otherwise this volume follows closely the model established by its predecessor. Conciliar decrees as well as papal bulls are included, with full Latin texts, and explanatory notes by both Grayzel and Kenneth Stow, who at Grayzel's request has updated the volume and seen it through the press. The notes themselves are admirable: probing, questioning, and open-ended, they provoke rather than foreclose discussion about the meaning and intent of the documents. The volume also includes two previously published articles</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 89 by Grayzel: his 1979 essay "Popes, Jews, and Inquisition: From 'Sicut' to 'Turbato' "; and his 1951 list of Pope John XXII's letters concerning Jews. A persons, places, and subjects index completes the volume. Comparison with the relevant sections of Shlomo Simonsohn's collection, The Apostolic See and the Jews: Documents 492-1404 (Toronto, 1988) suggests to me that scholars will want to have both works on their shelves. For John XXII's pontificate, the Simonsohn volume is clearly superior, printing fuller Latin texts than Grayzel offers, and adding to Grayzel's 1951 list a large number of additional documents. Grayzel's notes, however, remain valuable, and justify the decision to reprint the list. For the period 1254-1314, however, I suspect most scholars will prefer the Grayzel collection, although they will want to consult both. Twenty-six of the papal bulls in Grayzel's second volume do not appear in Simonsohn, while fourteen of Simonsohn's documents are not in Grayzel. The most important document found only in Simonsohn is #282, which appears to be either the text itself or a very closely related text to the bull noted in Grayzel #79, but of which Grayzel had been unable to find any copy. This bull, dating to the last six months of 1305, establishes a plausible link between King Philip IV's concern with his debasement of his own coinage and his decision to expel the Jews from France in the following year. Simonsohn's collection does not include the material from local councils contained in Grayzel, being limited strictly to papal letters, nor does he offer any notes. Grayzel's English summaries are also fuller and more detailed. Simonsohn, however, provides a number of archival references to additional copies of documents that are not noted in Grayzel. In many cases Simonsohn's transcriptions of documents also differ from Grayzel's readings. Although in most cases these differences are minor, in the case of one previously unpublished document, Clement IV's Dampnabili petfidia Judeorum of 1267 (Grayzel #28; Simonsohn #232), significant errors in transcription have clearly been made by someone. Not having access to the original document, however, I cannot judge which (if either) version is correct. I also noted a disturbing number of cases in which manuscript folio references to the same document differ between Grayzel and Simonsohn. Again, I cannot resolve these differences without access to the archival catalogues, but scholars planning to check these documents for themselves will do well to bring both Grayzel's and Simonsohn's archival references with them. There are a lot of</page><page sequence="3">90 BOOK REVIEWS frustrating folios between fol. 12a (Grayzel #80) and fol. 125r (Simonsohn #283) in Vatican Library Ms. Ottobon. 2546! A few minor corrections to the Grayzel volume may be offered. In Document 15, the amount quoted in the English summary should be 200 li., not 1200 li. Document 17 should be dated July 23, not July 19. Documents 34 and 39 in the John XXII section are also misdated; they should be February 18 and October 19 respectively. Document 48 has been very dramatically shortened, without any indication that portions of the text have been omitted. Textual variants between this and Simonsohn's version, however, seem to be errors in Simonsohn's text; Grayzel's readings agree at least with those in the published Register of Pope Martin IV. Documents 18, 23, and 43 also have been abbreviated without ellipses being adequately indicated. Document 19, meanwhile, has been abbreviated with proper indication, but not so as to make clear that the debts owed by the archbishop of Sens to these merchants of Rome were for loans he and his suffragans had taken out, rather than for merchandise purchased. Nor is it likely that Angelus Johannes Judeus, one of the merchants to whom the archbishop owed money, was in fact a Jew. As a surname, Judeus was not uncommon even for families that, so far as we know, had never converted from Judaism; and while Grayzel has rightly taught us to see papal policy toward Jews as less uniformly hostile than was once thought, even he found it hard to imagine a thirteenth-century pope addressing a faithful Jew as his "beloved son." To this reviewer, it remains an impossibility. Robert C. Stacey University of Washington Seattle, Wash.</page></plain_text>
