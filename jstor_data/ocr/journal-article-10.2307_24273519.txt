Benarroch Abstract: This paper reveals one of the most unique Zoharic Shema mysteries mysteries identified as "Rav Hamnuna Sabba's Mystery of Unity" [רזא דיחודא דרב תמנתא סבא]סבא]. This mystery is deeply connected to two nar rativerative figures in Zoharic literature: The Yanuka (the Zoharic wunder kind)kind) and the Saba (the wise old man). This paper argues that various poetic poetic aspects of these two figures illuminate the theosophic and mys ticaltical contents of their homilies as can be shown in the various homilies of the Yanuka and Saba on their unique Shema mystery. Introduction Among the various narrative figures in Zoharic literature, there are two that are exceptional in their mythical-symbolic nature: the Yanuka—the Zoharic wun derkindderkind—and the Saba—the wise old man.1 These figures are strongly linked to a unique Zoharic Shema mystery.2 This linkage can serve as a hermeneutical key to This essay is part of my research over the past two years, which was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Tikvah fellowship at Princeton University (2011), the Fulbright fellowship at Harvard University (2012), and the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. (2011-13). This research has been also funded by the European Research Council's Starting Grant TCCECJ headed by Dr. Pawel Maciejko of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2012—2014). I would also like to thank Joel Hecker for reading a draft of this essay and contributing valuable comments, and for sharing some of his find ings with me. Finally, I would like to thank Sara Tova Brody for her help in editing this essay. A paper I delivered in the 2011 AJS conference in Washington, in a session on literary approaches to the Zohar, served as a source for this essay. I would like to thank Eitan Fishbane for organizing this important AJS session. 1. This essay is based in part on my PhD dissertation, in which I focused on these two figures. See Jonatan Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka, 'Treyn de-inun hada': 'alegoriah, semel u-mitos ba-sifrut ha-zoharit" (PhD diss., Hebrew University, 2011), 357-378. On the Zoharic Yanuka and Saba figures, see also Michal Oron, "Motiv ha-Yanuka u-mashma'uto be-sefer ha-Zohar," Te'udah 21-22 (2006): 129-164; Oded Yisraeli, Parshanut ha-sod ve-sod ha-parshanut: megammot midrashiyot ve-hermanoitiyotve-hermanoitiyot be- "Saba de-mishpatim " sheba-Zohar (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 2005); Yehuda Liebes, "Myth vs. Symbol in the Zohar and in Lurianic Kabbalah," in Essential Papers on Kabbalah, ed.

Following the work of Abrams, 1 use the term "Zoharic literature," and not the "book of Zohar." See Daniel Abrams, Kabbalistic Manuscripts and Textual Theoiy: Methodologies of Textual Scholarship Scholarship and Editorial Practice in the Study of Jewish Mysticism (Jerusalem and Los Angeles: Magnes Press; Cherub Press, 2010), 224-428. However, in my view, although the Zohar is not a "book"—and therefore cannot be read with the assumption that there is complete coherence between different passages—there are nevertheless some poetic qualities that are unique to Zoharic literature at large. In my opinion, the only way to understand the wide range of these qualities is to compare 231</page><page sequence="2">JonatanJonatanJonatan M. Benarroch achieve a better understanding of both the mystical Zoharic homilies on the Shema recitation and the narrative framework in which they appear.3 Do the Yanuka and Saba stories serve only as poetic ornaments to the mys tical teachings on the Shema mysteries, or is the narrative and literary framework essential to the understanding of these Zoharic mysteries? And why are these two figures chosen for this set of Shema mysteries? As many scholars have shown before, various poetic aspects of the Zoharic nar rative illuminate the theosophic and mystical contents of the homilies, and vice versa.4 the same ideas and characters as they appear in all the different passages of the diverse Zoharic literature. 3.

Yanuka Story—Part One: Zohar Hadash Ruth (77b-78a) Part of the story describes the meeting between Rabbi Bun and the Yanuka, and, later on, with a few other sages: Rabbi Bun set out one day on the path and encountered a Yanuka. He said to him, "Rabbi, should I accompany you on your way and serve before you on this journey?" He replied, "Come." He went behind him. 4. See Liebes, "Ha-mashiah shel ha-Zohar"; Meroz, "Zoharic Narratives and Their Adap tations"; Fishbane, "Representation and the Boundaries of Realism"; Oron, "Simeni kha-hotam 'al libekha"; Tene, "Darkhei 'izuv ha-sippur be-sefer ha-Zohar"; Wolski, "Mystical Poetics." 5. The figure of R. Bun is one of the central figures in ZH Ruth, as opposed to the main stratum of Zoharic Literature, in which the central protagonist is Rabbi Shim'on Bar Yohai. See Meroz, "Va-'ani 10 hayiti sham?"; Liebes, "Ha-mashiah shel ha-Zohar." 6. As demonstrated in my previous work, ZH Ruth is the first stratum of Zoharic literature, intra ducing motifs that are developed in subsequent Yanuka and Saba stories. See Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 263-269. For more research on ZH Ruth see Daniel Abrams, Midrash ha-ne 'elam hu ZoharZohar Rut, originally published as Tapuhei zahav in Venice 1566 (Jerusalem: private edition, 1992), 1-13; Efraim Gottlieb, Mehkarim be-sifrut ha-kabbalah. ed.

Basser (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993). 7. The story appears scattered between the different locations both in the printed editions and in several manuscripts. The printed editions used are: Tapuhei zahav (Thiengen, 1559); Tapuhei zahav (Venice 1566); Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, 'Or yakar 17 (Jerusalem: 'Ahuzat Yisra'el, 1989), 197-226. However it should be mentioned that the Vilna Ga'on reconstructed the text in a similar manner. See Midrash Ruth he-Hadash (Hadrat Kodesh), ed. Eliyahu mi-Vilna (Warsaw 1865), 8a-b.

The first part of the story (ZH Ruth, 77b) describes Rabbi Bun, the story^ protagonist, arriv ing at Kfar Sikhnin, the location of Hamnuna Saba and his son's (the Yanuka) domicile, according to the central Zoharic Yanuka story (Zohar III, 86a-192a). See Benarroch, '"Oro shel Yanuka ve-sodo shel Saba." Later on (ZH Ruth, 77c), Rabbi Bun meets Yanai Sabba. See Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 264. 233</page><page sequence="4">JonatanJonatanJonatan M. Benarroch While travelling, he happened upon Rabbi Hiyya son of Abba and Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Yose. They said to him, "You're by yourself, with no one goading behind you." He answered, "There is a child following me." Rabbi Hiyya said, "You've invited harm to yourself, as you have no one with whom to engage in words of Torah!" They sat down in a field under a tree.9 From the description of the meeting between Rabbi Bun and the other sages, it seems that the Yanuka is visible only to Rabbi Bun.10 The framing of the Yanuka as an invisible child possibly alludes to his hybrid-mythic nature, between man and angel." In the continuation of the story, Rabbi Yehudah cites Rabbi Nehorai, who taught an important mystery regarding the Shema recitation: Rabbi Yehudah opened, saying: "It shall be healing to your body [and strength to your bones], [Proverbs3:8] The Torah is medicinal for a person—body and bones—in this world and in the world that is coming, as Rabbi Nehemiah taught in the name of Rabbi Nehorai:12 What is a daily tonic for people in this world? Recital of the Shema according to its requirements. Rabbi Nehorai said further: The recital of Shema contains 248 words cor responding to 248 limbs in a person's body. One who recites Shema as required—each and every one of his limbs takes a word for itself, and is healed by it. This is the meaning of "healing to your body, and strength to your bones"! [Proverbs3:8]13 The main mystical mystery of the Shema recitation, as cited in the name of Rabbi Nehorai, is that the total sum of the words in the Shema prayer is 248—which is par allelallel to the number of limbs in the human body.14 Rabbi Nehorai explained that the reading of the Shema can therefore serve as a supernatural cure for the body. In his words: "Each and every one of his limbs takes a word for itself, and is healed by it." Immediately after this homily, the figure of the Yanuka appears again: 9. ZH Ruth, 77d. In translating the Yanuka story in ZH Ruth I have relied mainly on the trans lation of Joel Hecker (as part of the Zohar: Pritzker Edition), and I thank him for sharing with me his translation, which is in preparation. 10. Another explanation might be that he has just fallen behind, as he catches up afterward and is described as being "wearied from the journey." See below n. 16. 11. 11. Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 264, 361-362; Benarroch, '"Oro shel Yanuka ve-sodo shel Saba," 76-106. 12. The name of Rabbi Nehorai translates literally as "light" (nehora). He is the "Rabbi of Light," and he can be seen as a prefiguration of Rav Hamnuna Saba—the Yanuka's father. On the figure of R. Nehorai as a prefiguration of Hamnuna Saba, see Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 291-292. 13. ZH Ruth, 77d. 14. cf. TZ21,47a. 234</page><page sequence="5">"The Mystery of Unity" Meanwhile, the Yanuka arrived, wearied from the journey, and he sat before them. He heard these teachings and rose to his feet, saying, "But in the Shema, there are only 245 words!" Rabbi Hiyya replied: "Sit down, my son, sit." He sat down. He [Rabbi Hiyya] continued, "My son, have you heard something about this?" He said to him, "This is what I have learned from my father. In the Shema there are 245 words, three words short of the number of limbs in a person's body. How is this resolved? The rabbis established that the prayer leader should repeat three words. What are they? 'I am YHVH, your God' [YHVH,[YHVH, your God, true]."15 The Yanuka, exhausted from the walk, suddenly reveals himself and appears before the rabbis. His exhaustion serves as a poetic indicator of the Shema mystery, the fact that reciting the Shema has the ability to cure human limbs. With the strength given him by his mystical knowledge, the Yanuka revives from his fatigue. He stands on his feet and argues with Rabbi Yehudah. He explains, in the name of his father, that there are three words that need to be added to the reading of the Shema in order to complete the count to 248 words. These three words are: "I am, YHVH, your God"(or "YHVH, your God, true"), which are added by the prayer-leader at the end of the Shema recitation in public. Ashkenazi Traditions on the 248 Words of Shema The idea that the Shema prayer has 248 words, in parallel to the 248 limbs of the human body, appears in Midrash Tanhuma;16 as demonstrated by Ta-Shma, it was widely known in Ashkenaz.17 The main custom originated from this idea was the addition of the phrase "God, faithful king"( 'El melekh ne'eman) before the Shema reading—as these three words complete the count of 248 words in 15. ZH Ruth, 77d. The translation follows V24, MS4, Tiengen, and Venice, which indicate that one repeats the words "I am YHVH, your God" (אני יי' אלהיכם, 'ani YHVH 'eloheikhem), V6, 017, L39, MS3, 018, and 'OryakaraW have "YHVH your God, truth" (יי' אלהיכם אמת, YHVH'Eloheikhem 'emet), in accordance with the emerging normative practice. Texts from fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Spain indicate that the practice there was to repeat "I am YHVH your God" ('ani YHVH 'eloheikhem). See Recanati, as cited in Maharam Alshaqar, Responsa 60; Moses ben Jacob of Kiev, Shoshan sodot, 8b-9a; Simeon ben Zemah Duran, Responsa 2:236; NZ n.ll; cf. de Leon, Shekel ha-kodesh,ed. Charles Mopsik (Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 1996), 84-85; Beit Yosef 'orah Hayim 61. i thank Joel Hecker for sharing with me his findings on this as part of his research in translating ZH Ruth, in the framework of the Zohar: Pritzker Edition, which is in preparation. 16. Tanhuma Kedoshim 6 records a tradition in the name of Rabbi Mani: "Do not look askance at the recital of Shema, for there are 248 words in it like the sum of limbs in a human body... The Blessed Holy One said: 'If you are vigilant [שמרת, shamarta\ regarding my [248], reciting Shema as prescribed, I shall guard [אשמר, 'eshmor] your [248].'" cf. B. Nedarim 36b. 17. On the Ashkenazi origins of this idea, see Israel M. Ta-Shma, '"El melekh ne'eman: gilgulo shel minhag (Terumah le-heker ha-Zohar)," Tarbizl9 (1969): 184-194; Israel M. Ta-Shma, "Tikkunim ve-hosafot le-ma'amar"EI melekh ne'eman,"' Tarbiz 40 (1970): 105-6; Elliot R. Wolfson, "Dimmui 'antropomorfi ve-ha-simbolikah shel ha-'otiyyot be-sefer ha-Zohar," in Sefer ha-Zohar ve-doro (Meh kereikerei Yerushalayim be-mahshevet Yisra'el 8 [1989]), ed. Joseph Dan (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1989), 161 n. 62. 235</page><page sequence="6">JonatanJonatan M. Benarroch private prayer. Ta-Shma also argued that the custom of adding "YHVH, your God, true" is a Zoharic innovation, which was eventually more widely accepted than the addition of "God, faithful king." The ending of the first part of the story (ZH Ruth Ruth 77d-78a) demonstrates the Zoharic polemic against the Ashkenazi tradition of adding "God, faithful king" before the Shema reading of a private prayer.18 The Zohar mentions the "early pious ones" establishing the idea of contem plating the 248 words of Shema as paralleling the 248 limbs: In the meantime, Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Pinhas came and sat among them. He said to them, "What topic are you discussing?" They said to him, "The words of the Shema, and here is what this Yanuka said...." He replied, "Certainly so!" And thus said Rabbi Yohanan son of Nuri in the name of Rabbi Yose son of Durmaskit, citing Rabbi Akiva: "Early pious ones established the recital of Shema to correspond to the Ten Command ments, as well as to the number of limbs in a person's body."19 It is plausible to assume that the phrase "early pious ones" in this paragraph refers to the Ashkenazi pietistic circles, since it was they who established the mystical liturgical ritual of contemplating the 248 limbs during the Shema recitation. The possibility of completing the count of 248 limbs in private prayer appears also as part of that same tradition established by the "early pious ones": But, whoever recites the Shema without the congregation does not perfect his limbs, because he is lacking the three words that the prayer leader repeats. What is his remedy? He should contemplate the fifteen vavs of 'Emet ve-yazivve-yazivve-yaziv [true and firm].20 Instead of the familiar tradition of adding "God, faithful king" ('El melekh nene'eman) before reciting the Shema in a private prayer, the Zohar describes a tra dition that appears in the prayer commentary ascribed to Eleazar of Worms, which offers a unique way of completing the 248 words of Shema in private prayer: con templating the fifteen vavs that precede the words of praise that immediately follow the Shema at the beginning of the morning blessing.21 18. According to Ta-Shraa, the main polemic is against the Ramban's prohibition of adding "God, faithful king" ('El melekh ne'eman) before the Shema recitation, in order to prevent any break between the Ve- 'ahavta blessing and the Shema. See Ta-Shma, '"El melekh ne'eman," 190-192. 19. ZH Ruth, 77d-78a. 20. ZH Ruth, 78a. 21. Sixteen adjectives of praise immediately follow the Shema recitation, at the beginning of the morning blessing, which follows it. After the first one, "truth," ('emet), the next fifteen are all joined with the letter vav, "and." It is not clear how the recitation of these fifteen vavs serves as a substitute for a full 248-word recital of the Shema, but the prayer commentary ascribed to Eleazar of Worms indi cates that these fifteen times six—the numerical value of vav—equal ninety, corresponding to the word "just," צדק zedek, in Psalms 17:1; the letter zadi(s.) at the beginning of the word has the numerical value of 90. Midrash Tehillim 17:6 explains as follows: '"Hear YHVH what is just' (שמעה, shim'ah)—this 236</page><page sequence="7">"The Mystery of Unity" The Yanuka, in the name of his father, rejects the possibility of completing the count of 248 words in private prayer: Nonetheless, of a person following this practice, [my] father imputed: "A crooked thing cannot be made straight [nor can the lack be counted]..." [Ecclesiastes 1:15]. Those three words of Shema that the prayer leader repeats—he cannot count them toward the sum of 248, as is the case for the congregation. He [Rabbi Yehudah] said to the Yanuka: Expound your verse!22 This stance of the Yanuka's seems to polemicize against the Ashkenazi tradition of adding "God, faithful king" (or of contemplating the fifteen vavs of the 'Emet ve-yazivve-yaziv prayer) in private prayer. Rather, it favors the Zoharic tradition of adding, "I am, YHVH, your God" (or "YHVH, your God, true") in order to com plete the count of 248 words of the Shema, in the context of public prayer only.23 Traces of this polemic can also be found in the writings of Rabbi Moses de Leon, in his book Maskiot kesef,24 where he argues that the addition of "God, faithful king" in order to complete the count of 248 words in the Shema is a mistaken tradition. However, he does mention the possibility of con templating the fifteen vavs of the 'Emet ve-yaziv prayer as a solution for private prayer.25 Yanuka Story—Part Two: Zohar Hadash 'Aharei Mot (48a) The continuation of our Yanuka story appears in ZH 'Aharei Mot 48a. After being asked by Rabbi Yehudah, at the end of the previous paragraph, to cite a verse that supports his argument, the Yanuka responds: The Yanuka opened, saying: "My people! What have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Witness me!" [Micah 6:3]26 signifies the recitation of Shema." This is, to be sure, much more convoluted than the Zohar's usual style. On the fifteen vavs, see Judah son of Yakar, Peirush ha-tefillot ve-ha-berakhot, 30-32; Peirushei siddursiddur tefillah ha-Rokeah, 298-99; cf. Midrash ha-gadol Terumah 26:8; cf. Beit Yosef 'orah havim 61.1 thank Joel Hecker for sharing with me his findings on this as part of his research in translating ZH Ruth, in the framework of the Zohar: Pritzker Edition which is in preparation. 22. ZH Ruth, 78a. This paragraph (without mention of the figures of the Yanuka and his father), appears in an unprinted fragment of Rabbi Moses de Leon's Shoshan 'edut, see Wolfson, "Dimmui 'antropomorfi," 162-3 n. 66; cf. Ta-Shma, "Tikkunim ve-hosafot le-ma'amar' 'El melekh ne'eman,"' 105. For more on Shoshan 'edut, see: Moses de Leon, "Shoshan 'edut," ed. Gershom Scholem, Kovez 'al yad, 8 (1976): 325-70. However, it is not clear if this work was written prior to the Zoharic passage or whether it is actually "quoting" from the Zohar. 23. Cf. Zohar II, 156a. 24. Moses de Leon, Sefer maskiyyot kesef ed.

Benarroch The opening verse of the Yanuka's homily serves as one of the poetic indicators that this section, appearing in ZH Aharei Mot, is in fact the continuation of the earlier Yanuka story. The Yanuka is described in the first part of the story as being "wearied from the journey," and here he opens with a verse that describes the weariness of the people of Israel. The Yanuka then continues developing his mystical teaching on the 248 words of the Shema recitation, which he explains consist of different combinations of God's name (mainly names of forty-two and seventy-two letters).27 He ends this homily by repeating the idea that the number of words in the Shema is parallel to the number of limbs in the human body: Whoever recites the Shema fittingly—each and every word overflows onto each and every one of his limbs. And if a person does not recite the Shema in the morning and evening, each and every one of his limbs will be permeated with evil spirit and diverse forms of execrable diseases that are found in the world.2s In this description there is another connection to the central Zoharic Yanuka story (Zohar III, Balak, 186a-192a). In the beginning of the Balak Yanuka story the Yanuka tells the sages who come to visit him that he can smell from their clothes that they did not recite the Shema that day. It is plausible that the bad odor of their clothes reflects the "evil spirit" mentioned here, which fills the limbs of one who does not recite the Shema.29 At the end of this passage is a homily by Saba de-Yanuka,30 the Yanuka's father: The Old Man [Saba] —the child's father [Saba de-Yanuka]—opened, saying: "There was a small city, and few people within it...

This is the only source in all Zoharic literature where the term: "Saba de-Yanuka" (סבא דינוקא) is used. This term is another example of the strong linkage between the Saba and Yanuka figures.

ZH'Aharei Mot 48a. 238</page><page sequence="9">"The Mystery of Unity" Yanuka Story—Part Three: Zohar Hadash Ruth (80c-81a) The homily that has the Yanuka's father expounding a few verses from Ecclesiastes constitutes further evidence for the connection between the first part of the story, in ZH Ruth (77d-78a) and this subsequent part of the story. According to the printed editions (and a few manuscripts), this verse is the same with which the Yanuka begins his homily at the end of the first part of the story {ZH Ruth 78a). This homily is also a connecting homily to the third and final part of the story, as it appears in Midrash Ruth 80d, describing a series of homilies on the verses in Ecclesiastes taught by the Yanuka: Rabbi Rehumai32 [Hisdai] opened: "There was once a small city with only a few people in it, and there came a great king against it."[Ecclesiastes 9:14], A small small city—this is what Rabbi Yose said in the name of Rabbi Yizhak: this signifies the body. Few people within it—these are the limbs. There came a great great king against it—this is the evil inclination... Rabbi Bun said: That Yanuka who had been sitting with us—what did he say about this verse? Well, this is how he opened: A small city—the assembly of Israel....33 The fact that the homily was delivered by Rabbi Rehumai34 serves as another proof of the connection between the part of the story that appears in ZH'Aharei Mot Mot 48a and the continuation of the story as it appears here, in ZH Ruth 80c-d. The figure of Rabbi Rehumai (whose name can be translated as "The Rabbi of Love") can be understood as a prefiguration of Rav Hamnuna Saba, the Yanuka's father.35 If this is correct, there might have been a version of the story in which the homily delivered by the Saba de-Yanuka, as presented in ZH'Aharei Mot Mot 48a, was attributed to Rabbi Rehumai.36 After Rabbi Rehumai finishes his homily on the verses from Ecclesiastes, the story goes on to describe the Yanuka's homilies on these same verses. There is also a strong thematic linkage between the mystical teachings of the Yanuka (in the name of his father) on the 248 limbs, and the homily of Rabbi Rehumai: "/I small city— this is the human body; only a few people in it—these are the human limbs." After the series of homilies by the Yanuka on the Ecclesiastes verses, the story ends with a description of the sages kissing the Yanuka37 and blessing 32. The name Rabbi Rehumai appears in V6 and MS3. 33. ZHRuth, 80c-d. 34. I believe the correct version of this part of the story is the one that appears in at least two manuscripts (V6 and MS3), describing Rabbi Rehumai, and not Rabbi Hisdai (as appears in the printed edition), as delivering the homily. 35. On the figure of Rabbi Rehumai as a "Saba" figure, portrayed similarly to Rav Hamnuna, see Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 157, 264-5 n. 47. 36. It should be mentioned that in both of the homilies, the "great king" (in Ecclesiastes 9:14) is interpreted as representing the "evil inclination." 37. It is also possible to interpret this description as a kiss given by the sages to Rabbi Bun (and not the Yanuka). On the significance of the act of kissing in Zoharic literature, see Joel Hecker, "Kissing 239</page><page sequence="10">JonatanJonatan M. Benarroch him: "The companions came and kissed him.

[Isaiah[Isaiah 54:13]38 The Mystery of Lilies: The Shema Mysteries in Pikudin This text, from the Zoharic Pikudin stratum, which appears in Zohar III 263a-b,39 consists of the same Shema mysteries that are identified with the Yanuka's father, as mentioned in the ZH Ruth Yanuka story. It is one of the imp.or tant sources for unraveling the Shema mysteries of the Yanuka's father. In the printed editions (in Zohar III 263a) the story is found in proximity to a Zoharic text that lays out a homily delivered by Yeiva,40 who appears in the Zohar only as "Yeiva Saba." As Yehuda Liebes has argued, and as I discussed at length elsewhere, the figure of Yeiva Sabba—particularly as it is described in Saba de-mishpatimde-mishpatim—is identified with Hamnuna Saba, the Yanuka's father.41 By placing the Pikudin text near this text of Yeiva (Saba), the later editors of the Zohar aimed to connect the Pikudin Shema mysteries to the figure of Hamnuna Saba.42 In the beginning of the homily the Saba discusses the various mystical meanings of each word in the opening verse of the Shema: ["Hear, O Israel: YHVH, our God, YHVH is one." (Deuteronomy 6:4)] Rabbi Yeiva [Yeisa43 ][Saba] says that "Hear, O Israel" [Shema Yisra 'el] is Israel the Old Man [Yisra'el Saba\.44 Kabbalists: Hierarchy, Reciprocity And Equality," in Love—Ideal and Real—in the Jewish Tradition from from the Hebrew Bible to Modern Times, eds.

An additional Zoharic homily on the Shema mysteries, and one of the central sources on these mysteries, is also strongly identified with the Yanuka and with his father—the Saba. 39. This text mistakenly appears in the printed editions as part of the Ra 'aya mehemna stratum. See Yehuda Liebes, "Porfuritah shel Helenah mi-Troyah ve-kidush ha-Shem," Da 'at 57-59 (2005): 118-119.

The original Zoharic homily is attributed to Yeiva Saba as can be found in Recanati on Deu teronomy 6:4. Another original Zoharic quotation of this homily appears in the writings of the apostate Paulus de Heredia. See Yehuda Liebes, "Christian Influences in the Zohar," in Studies in the Zohar, trans.

Not enough attention has been paid in the research of Zoharic literature to the editorial con siderations of the late editors, who chose to add chunks from various Zoharic units (e.g. Midrash ha-Neha-Neha-Ne:elam, Pikudin, Matnitin, Sitrei Torah, Ra'aya mehemna and Tikkunei Zohar, etc.) into the Zoharic pericopes which are the main stratum of the Zoharic literature (usually identified as "Guf ha-Zoliar"),ha-Zoliar"), as they appear in the printed editions. As is evident from most Zoharic manuscripts, these different Zoharic units do not appear within the original Zoharic pericopes, but rather as separate units. 240</page><page sequence="11">"The Mystery of Unity" Yeiva (Saba) identifies the opening words of the Shema: "Hear, O Israel"—with Israel the Old Man—the mythical embodiment of Israel that is represented by the figure of the Old Man.45 In other words: Israel the Old Man (Yisra 'el Saba) is ident ified here with Tiferet or Ze'ir 'Anpin, illuminated by 'Atika Kadisha, the highest level of the Zoharic Godhead,46 who appears in some Zoharic stories (especially in the Tikkunei Zohar and the Ra 'aya mehemna stratum) as the Saba figure 47 The Unity of Human Limbs Unites the "Divine Limbs" The Pikudin Shema mysteries, which appear near the short homily by Yeiva (Saba), begin as follows: Thus the Blessed Holy One is one and only above and below. Whoever declares the unity of the name of the Blessed Holy One should direct his heart and will to the unification \yehuda] we have mentioned, and connect all his limbs by means of the meditation we mentioned, so that all his limbs will all become one.48 The text speaks of the unification of the human limbs with God's limbs through mediation on the Shema recitation. The unity of God's image depends on the unity of man's limbs.49 This teaching is also explained in mythical terms in the next few lines of the homily: At that time, there is an angel, a master of248 worlds—all called "limbs." His name is Heleniu. He stands awaiting that unification. He is the "collector of lilies," as it is written, "to gather lilies," which are the body's limbs. The Supernal Name gathers the Supernal Body's limbs according to the meditation, which is unified by means of the mystery of forty-two names. It picks all those supernal lilies. This angel collects all the lower [lilies], which together constitute the seventy-two names.50 43. The name "Yeisa" also appears in Zoharic literature mainly as "Yeisa Saba." See Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 8-13. 44. Zohar III 263a. 45. In midrashic literature the title "Israel the Elder" refers to Israel the Patriarch (Jacob), as opposed to the people Israel.

Benarroch They are all picked by that meditation and all become one body— accord ing to the same mystery.51 The idea that the unity of God's image depends on the unity of man's limbs during the recitation of the Shema is found explicitly in a kabbalistic work named Shoshan sodotsodot (Lily of Mysteries),52 which preserved many early kabbalistic ideas, especially from the Ashkenazi pietistic circles. In the words of the "Lily of Mysteries": Since the intention of Moses was that the sum of the words of the Shema would correspond to the 248 limbs of the human body, why did he cause a lack [of three words in the Shema]? And if that was not his intention, why do we have to add [three words] to complete the sum of 248 words?.... One adds: "God, faithful king" ['El melekh ne'eman ] and the other adds: "I am YHVH, your God"[God"['AniGod"['Ani YHVH Eloheikhem],.. and the impurity rises until the Hesed is in all the limbs of the upper Adam [ha- 'adam ha-'elyon]53—excluding the three celestial limbs, which are the three upper sefirot [Keter, Hokhmah and Binah]. These three words are missing so that we will not allude to them [during the Shema meditation]. In order not to omit them completely, we allude to them indirectly: "I am YHVH, your God". So that the upper Adam will not be lacking these three limbs we add these three words: "I am YHVH, your God." All this is recited in public prayer, as it is only in the public prayer that prayer is heard, with no impurity separating them [from divinity]. But in private prayer one does not [add these three words: "I YHVH, your God"]. One who recites the [Shema] in private, should direct his intention to the fifteen vavs of 'Emet ve-yaziv,ve-yaziv, whose numerical value equals "I am YHVH, your God" [ 'Ani YHVH Eloheikhem] in gematria.. .54 As Elliot Wolfson has shown, this idea appears also in Sefer ha-navon— an anonymous book of the pietistic circles of twelfth-thirteenth-century Ashkenaz.55 This book is a commentary on the Shema prayer, in which the words of the prayer are connected with the organs of God {shi'ur komah).56 51.

[Ezekiel 1:26]58 De Leon uses almost the exact same wording as the Zohar in describing a few of his Shema mysteries (both in Shekel ha-kodesh and in Shoshan'edut) and he attri butes them to Midrash Yerushalmi or to kadmonim (ancient sages), referring to the Zohar.59 "My Beloved has Gone Down Into His Garden to Gather Lilies" The Pikudin text is rich in its mythic imagery: with the correct meditation during the Shema reading, each human limb becomes a lily that is "picked" by Heleniu,60 the "angel of lilies"—identified with the angel Metatron,61 who collects the lilies and unites them with the "upper lilies." Then all the lilies of the upper and lower worlds—representing the limbs of God and of men—unite and become one.62 The lily, or the rose, is one of the important allegoric symbols in Zoharic literature. It is usually linked to the Shekhinah or, more accurately, to the human's unification with the Shekhinah,63 and is probably connected to mystical Christian traditions which relate to the rose as a mystical symbol.64 KabbalisticKabbalistic Mysticism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 46-8.

The rose was considered a symbol of mystery from antiquity onwards. For early Christians the rose served as a visual expression of paradise, but also of martyrdom (Cyprian, Ep. 10). However, the most central symbolism of the rose is its identification with the Virgin Mary, which dates back to the 243</page><page sequence="14">JonatanJonatan M. Benarroch In the Zohar III (Pikudin), 233a-b the lily/rose symbolizes the act of unifica tion itself, which is the central act of the Shema prayer: The lily... is witness to the heavenly unity. And this is so because in a lily there are thirteen petals, all of them stemming from one root, and there are five strong petals on the outside, that cover the rose and protect it. And it is all in the mystery of wisdom... The lily is a witness to the unity of five words: "Hear, Oh Israel, YHVH, our God, YHVH" [Shema'a Yisra'el YHVH 'Eloheinu YHVH] [Deuteronomy 6:4]. These are the five strong leaves; they are the roots and the unity which are attached to them. [While] "one" ['ehad] is the prime cause and the root to which all of them are attached, these thirteen petals are the mystery of thirteen,65 and this [the word "one"] is the king^ signet ring.66 A similar idea appears in the opening passages of the Zohar, where the rose becomes a symbol of the unification with the Shekhinah while blessing and holding the cup of benediction. The cup, filled with wine, is identified with the petals of the rose—signifying the Shekhinah, and the stem and five leaves are identified with the phallic arm and five fingers holding the cup—signifying the covenant (brit yesod). The holy name of God is "seeded" in the cup, through the fingers, symbolizing the unification of the Shekhinah.67 Evident here is the linkage between the symbol of the lily (or rose) and the human limbs (the hand and fingers), all connected to the act of divine unification. fifth century theologian Sedulius Caelius. See Barbara Seward, The Symbolic Rose (New York: Colum hia University Press, 1960), 1-52. Like many Christian symbols found in Zoharic literature, the symbol of the rose presents an example of the complex shared discourse of the two cultures (probably resulting from the shared cultural environment). This discourse is characterized by an ambivalent attitude towards Christianity, combining both a deep revulsion of it and a strong attraction to some Christian ideas and symbols.

Zohar I, la. 244</page><page sequence="15">"The Mystery of Unity" "The lily conceals these thirteen, the numerical value of 'one' [ 'ehad]."6s This statement, mentioned by Rabbi Shim'on in Tikkunei Zohar, is deeply rooted in the Pikudin text, emphasizing the importance of the "one," and the lily as the symbol of the limbs of the body: At that time all the body's limbs are gathered and connected into one, so they will all be according to the same meaning above and below, according to the mystery of "there shall be one YHVH, and his name one" [yiheyeh YHVH YHVH 'ehad'ehad u-shemo 'ehad, Zechariah 14:9]. For that reason in the word "one" [ ehad] the pronunciation of two letters [het[het and dale(] is lengthened, to gather lilies so as to be united by means of the same mystery by the complete meditation [yehuda shalim].69 The mystery of the "one" is underscored through the essence of the Shema recita tion as the declaration of God's unity and the unification of his name in the upper and lower worlds. The concept here combines both the theoretical idea of God's unity and the visualization of the unity between man and the divine. As part of this visualization, the word "one" ('ehad) is symbolized by the lily, which contains the thirteen petals corresponding to the numerical value of one. Thus, both the human body below and the upper body above are represented by the symbol of the lily, the concept of "one," and the numerical value of thirteen. By unifying them, the "one" of below and the "one" of above become twenty-six, the numeri cal value of the Tetragrammaton, the holy name of God, YHVH. This means that the wholeness of the name of God depends on the unity between man and the divine, the lower and upper lily; "so they will all be according to the same meaning above and below." Thus it appears that during the meditative visualization process of the recital of the Shema, the person who recites it goes through a symbolic-mythical trans formation, and is symbolically incarnated in a lily. He then rises above and unites with the symbolic-mythical "upper lily." By uniting both lilies, each equiv alent to thirteen, the numerical value of "one" ('ehad), they become identified with the unified name of God: YHVH, which is equivalent to twenty-six. In light of this, states the source, one can better understand the mystical meaning of the custom of lengthening the word "one" in the Shema recitation: "For that reason in the word "one" [ ehad] the pronunciation of two letters [het and dalet] is lengthened, to gather lilies so as to be united by means of the same mystery by the complete meditation." This practice, which already appears in the Talmud,70 acts as a poetic indicator of the unifying meditation. The utterance of the word "one" during the Shema recitation is performed as an act of speech;71 this custom of lengthening the two letters het and dalet—which 68. TZ 71a: 25-26. 69.

Benarroch together are pronounced "had"), meaning "one" in Aramaic—hints at the unifica tion toward which this speech act strives. By mentioning this custom, the author alludes to the famous talmudic story about the death of Rabbi Akiva: When R. Akiva was taken out for execution, it was the hour of the recital of the Shema. And while they combed his flesh with iron combs, he was accept ing upon himself the kingship of heaven. His disciples said to him: "Our teacher, even to this point?" He said to them: "All my days I have been troubled by this verse, 'with all thy soul', [which 1 interpret] 'even if He takes thy soul.' I said: When shall I have the opportunity of fulfilling this? Now that I have the opportunity shall I not fulfill it?" He prolonged the word "one" [ 'ehad] until he expired while saying it. A divine voice [Bat KoI\ went forth and proclaimed: "Happy art thou, Akiva, that thy soul has departed with the word 'one'!"72 This story suggests that the highest form of performing the Shema recitation is the self-sacrifice of one's own body, and becoming a martyr.73 Similarly, the word "one" in the Zoharic homily signifies the moment of unification between man and the divine, which itself influences the unity within the divine between the She khinah and God.74 This is the moment in which the soul departs the human body and unites with God, becoming a "lily" that is "picked" and raised above. In this context it should be mentioned that, in Zoharic literature, the act of "picking the lily" usually serves as an allegoric description of the untimely death of the righteous and of infants who have never had a chance to sin.75 This allegoric description appears in Midrash Rabbah on the Song of Songs, and it is probably this source which influenced the Zohar in shaping this allegoric description.76 This idea can also be found in an interesting Zoharic source describing the act of "picking the lilies": 72. B. Berakhot 61b. 73. A similar Zoharic example of the lily symbolizing martyrdom can be found in the descrip tion of the "ten martyrs" ('aseret harugei malkhut) as lilies embroidered on the parokhet. See Liebes, "Porfuritah shel Helenah," 86-88, 101-119. 74. According to the Lurianic mystical tradition, during the recitation of Shema one has to con template one's willingness to give his own soul to God through martyrdom, in order to unite the "Mother" and "Father" (the Shekhinah and God).

Therefore it is written: "lilies" [ששנים], do not read shoshanim but rather sheshonim [they who memorize (the words of Torah)], that even in the grave they whisper words of Torah... Come and see: when Jeroboam was a child he was righteous and did not commit any sin. The Blessed Holy One said to the angel of death: "Go and bring me Jeroboam ben Nebat." At that time the ministering angels said to him: '"YHVH, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth'[Psalms 8:2]! Your name is glorious, and he [Jeroboam the child] is righteous, leave him, as for his good deeds we are blessed." The Blessed Holy One said to them: "If your wish is that I leave him, I will do so." Later, he [Jeroboam] began to sin, and made two golden calves, and he caused the people of Israel to sin. The Blessed Holy One told them [the ministering angels]: "All the blessings you received from him, turned over into filth. Would it not have been better for you that you had agreed to bring him to me when he was still righteous [as a small child], and Metatron would have taught him Torah?"77 At that time, they [the ministering angels] all opened and said: "Righteous are you, YHVH, and upright are your judgments."[Psalms 119:137] And therefore the Blessed Holy One went down into his garden, to gather lilies.78 A similar version of this tale appears in Midrash ha-ne'elam on Genesis, and there the "picking of the lily" is explicitly described as a macabre allegory for dying infants who are "picked" by God when their "smell" is still fresh: Rabbi Yehudah said: It is like a king who had a garden. One day he came to walk in his garden, and he saw small lilies growing in it, and their fragrance was like no other fragrance in the world. The king said: "If this [their smell] is so now, when they are still small; when they grow, it will surely be much stronger." After a few days he came into the garden, thinking he would find those lilies, which were fresh and had such good smell... as he noticed that they were dry and had no odor, he got angry and said: "If I had picked them when they were still fresh and good, with a fine smell, I would have enjoyed them; but now, how can I enjoy them, as they are already dried out?" In the following year, the king entered in the garden and saw small lilies with a fine smell. He said: "I will pick them now, and I will enjoy them before they 77. Metatron is the patron of children who died young and teaches them Torah. See Yehuda Liebes, "Ha-Zohar ke-sefer halakhah," Tarbiz 64 (1995): 589-590; Benarroch, "Saba ve-yanuka," 72-73, 341; Bennaroch, '"Oro shel Yanuka ve-sodo shel Saba," 39^10. 78.

Benarroch dry out as they did before." In the same way, the Blessed Holy One sees "small people" [infants], who have a fine smell, and he knows that they will eventually sin.... Now, when they are still good, he takes them from this world, in order to give them a good portion in the world to come. Therefore it is written: "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he grazes among the lilies." [Song of Songs 6:3]79 The infant's soul is thus "picked" by God's angel,80 as God has the desire to smell the infant's soul, the "lily," while it is still fresh. From the verse of Song of Songs quoted in the end it appears that God, the "beloved," has an erotic desire to unite with the infant's soul.81 A parallel description can be found in the most central Saba story, Saba de-mishpatim: All those tormented souls, who are they? Here is a mystery. These are souls of little infants, suckling from their mothers' potent breasts. And the Blessed Holy One sees that if they endure in the world their odor will stink and they will turn sour like vinegar. He plucks them small, while they still yield fragrance.82 The infants, or "tormented souls," are also identified with the figure of the Yanuka, the son of the Saba.83 The central argument here is that the Yanuka, as he appears in the central Yanuka story in the Balak pericope, dies as a small child because of God's desire to "smell" him: The Blessed Holy One yearns to smell the scent of this "apple." Blessed is his portion!... It is not for me to accuse the Blessed Holy One, but were it not for the fact that he longs to smell his sweet scent, no one would prevail over him.84 Here, in the end of this Yanuka story, the Yanuka is identified with the symbol of the "apple," which is "picked" by God, who "longs to smell its sweet scent."85 Interestingly, we can find an explicit hint connecting the symbols of the "apple" and the "lily" to an elevation to God in the Pikudin text as well: There are 613 commandments in these lilies, which represent the limbs of the two sides... they have in them the high level of the precious gold that is 79.

And in any place in which they are found, that high level is found in them, in order to be raised. And this is the mystery of: "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood [so is my beloved among the sons] .... As the lily among thorns [so is my love among the maidens]." [Song of Songs 2:2-3] Blessed is he who sacrifices these offerings. Surely this offering is favor able to him both in this world and in the World to Come.86 It is clear from this quote that both the "apple" and the "lily" serve as symbols of erotic desire. The Yanuka is both the "apple" and the "lily" that God longs to unite with. These symbols, signifying the human body and limbs, function as an "offer ing"ing" that has been presented to God. Therefore the Yanuka, who dies as a small child, is also identified with the "Sacrificed Son."87 The "Complete Offering": The Mystery of Sacrifice Accordingly, the Pikudin text connects the mystical teachings of the Shema to the mystery of sacrifice: That meditation rises and unites everything in the two sides into one unity... Once all body parts are united, according to the same mystery of the same meditation, the whole is considered a "complete offering."88 This part adds an important component to the Pikudin mystical teaching on the Shema reading: the mystery of the "complete offering." The text implies that as part of the meditation process—of the unification of the upper and lower limbs—the human limbs serve as a "sacrifice" offered to God. The phrase "complete offering" (korbana shalim) refers to the highest kind of offering—that is, the offering of man's own son.89 The most important Zoharic source on this phrase appears in the Rav metivta section, which is linked in many ways to the Yanuka and Saba stories throughout the Zohar: "The offering of the youth" [korbana de-rabya]: when a man brings90 his child to school or to circumcision, that is the "complete offering" [korbana shalim] to be accepted.91 86. Zohar III (Pikudir) 263a-b. 87. Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 357-358.

Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 297. 90. The Aramaic word that is used here is: קרב (karev), which is similar to the word used for the act of sacrifice. 91. Zohar III (Rav metivta), 164a. 249</page><page sequence="20">JonatanJonatan M. Benarroch The act of bringing the child to his circumcision, or later to school, is described as an act of "offering" the child.92 In our context it is important to focus on the act of circumcision,93 since it refers directly to a bodily organ that has been cut off from the body, and is therefore the closest act to actual "human sacrifice." This percep tion of circumcision can be found explicitly in the later stratum of Zoharic litera ture, in Ra'aya mehemna: Any man has to offer his son to the Blessed Holy One with joy, with the will of his heart, to elevate him under the wings of the Shekhinah. And the Blessed Holy One accepts this offering as a "complete offering," which is happily accepted by him. And this offering is similar to animal offering: this is offered on the eighth day, and this is offered on the eighth day, as it is written: "When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice by fire to YHVH" [Leviticus 22:27], After one week passes, as the Sabbath had passed, then "it shall be accepted." This is given as an offering, and this is given as an offer ing. Why? As he encountered and embraced that Sabbath, the mystery of cir cumcision, and therefore all is in the upper mystery.94 It is clear that the phrase: "a complete offering" (korbana shalim) refers to the highest form of offering: the offering of the son. This is demonstrated in the par allelallel between the act of circumcision to the act of offering an animal, both done from the eighth day after birth onward.95 As one might expect, this same term is used in the context of the most famous act of child offering in Judaism, the bib lical story of the "offering of Isaac" (the 'akedah). In the Zoharic interpretation of this story we find the following statement: "Isaac, who was bound to the altar, was a "complete offering" [korbana shalim] before the Blessed Holy One."96 To conclude, there is no doubt that the use of the term "complete offering" in the Pikudin text conceals a strong reference to the idea of "offering" man's organs as an offering to God. In our context this offering can also be seen as a way to "complete" God's image by the offering of one's limbs, which unite with the upper limbs—the limbs of God: The lilies are a mystery. When these limbs are connected together so as to be one, by means of one meditation according to the mystery of the sacrifice... There are 613 commandments in these lilies, which are the limbs of the two 92. Cf. Benarroch, "Saba ve-Yanuka," 13-14. 93.

Surely this offering is favor able to him both in this world and the World to Come.97 From here it is clear that the mystery of the sacrifice referred to in this homily is the apotheosis of man's limbs. These limbs unify with the limbs of the divine and together they create God's "body." This heavenly "body" is also identified with the mythic figure of Adam, and consists of 613 body parts, the same number as the sum of the Torah commandments.98 The Shema Mystery of Rav Hamnuna Saba A few sources explicitly mention the connection between Rav Hamnuna Saba and his unique mystical meditation on the Shema. For example, the Zoharic homily found in Zohar II Va-yakhel (216a b): Mystery of unity [raza de-yehuda]—for one who is worthy of the world that is coming must unify the name of the Blessed Holy One, uniting limbs of the upper and lower rungs, bringing them all where they should be—binding the knot. This is the mystery written: "Hear, O Israel, YHVH our God, YHVH is one." [Deuteronomy 6:4] The mystery of Shema: Hear [shetn 'a, שמע]—a name [shem, ־שם], amounting to 'ayin [a], seventy names, one totality. IsraelIsrael—Israel the Old Man, for there is a small one [zutta], as is written: "When Israel was a youth, I loved him," [Hosea 11:1] whereas this is Israel the Old Man [Yisra'el Saba], One mystery in one totality: "Hear, O Israel" [shem[shem 'a Tisra 'el\—here, the wife merges with her husband. After they merge with one another into one whole, the limbs must be unified —joining two dwellings as one, with all the limbs, in heartfelt devo tion, ascending in cleaving to the 'Ein Sof uniting all there and becoming one will... This is the unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba, taught him by his father, from the latter's teacher, reaching back to the mouth of Elijah." It is fine, a perfect unification. Although we have established this by various mysteries, and all those mysteries amount to one, still this mystery I found in his book, and it is fine, a perfect unification [yehuda be-tikkuna\. We have already educed the meaning of the unification of another mystery, which is a fine and fitting unification—so it is! But this unification is a perfect unification [yehuda be-tikkuna]; this is the unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba!100 97. Zohar III (Pikudiri) 263a-b. 98. It should be mentioned that many of these motifs are influenced by the early Shi 'ur komah literature, which portrays God's limbs through references both to the mythic figure of Adam. See Wolfson, "Dimmui 'antropomorfi," 161-163. 99. Cf. ZH Ruth, 83b. 100. Zohar II (Va-yakhel) 216a-b.

Benarroch It is clear from this passage that the teaching of the "mystery of unity," represent ing the unique meditation of the Shema that unites the upper and lower limbs, is identified with Hamnuna Saba.101 The Shema mysteries in both the Pikudin stratum and this source open with the identification of Israel (of the opening verse of the Shema, "Hear, O Israel") as "Israel the Old Man." And in both homi lies the focus of the Shema meditation is the unity of the upper and lower limbs: "joining two dwellings as one, with all limbs, in heartfelt devotion." Moreover, the passage emphasizes that the "mystery of unity" of Hamnuna Saba is a "perfect unification" \yehuda be-tikkuna]. This Shema unification is "higher" than the common Shema unification, which probably refers to the Shema unification homilies mentioned in the Zohar on Terumah.i0־ These homi lies (in Zohar on Terumah) are characterized by a much simpler Zoharic style, focusing primarily on the unification of God and the Shekhinah. The Shema uni fication of Hamnuna Saba, on the other hand, focuses on the unification of the "upper and lower limbs" and on the mysteries of the "offering" of one's body and limbs. Another interesting source appears in the Hebrew writings of the Tikkunei Zohar Zohar and Ra 'ay a mehemna, published by Ephraim Gottlieb: I saw written in the name of Rabbi Shim'on Bar Yohai that he asked Elijah: "Why are there different opinions on the way the Blessed Holy One is unified [during the recitation of the Shema], as there are different opinions interpreted by our sages on the Shema unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba? ...."...." Elijah said to him: "Of course this [Shema unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba] is similar to the manna that had come down from above, whom every one tasted according to his will and ability [to taste]; the same is with this unification: any one perceives it according to his will and ability [to perceive]...."1 3 The most important element in this passage here is the use of the phrase "the Shema unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba." This phrase is repeated several times during the discussion between Rabbi Shim'on and Elijah, proving that it was well known in the later stratum of Zoharic literature that there was a unique Shema unification identified with Hamnuna Saba. It was even so well known that apparently there had already been a few different opinions on the exact meaning of this special unification. The The Wisdom of the Zohar: An Anthology of Texts, trans.

As we have seen above in the Zohar on Terumah, Elijah appears as the one who originally transmitted the Shema mystery known as "the unification of Rav Hamnuna Saba." Further on, in Rabbi Shim'on Bar Yohai and Elijah's discussion there is an explicit allusion to this Shema mystery: "There are 248 [limbs] parallel to the 248 words in the Shema recitation pericopes that were transmitted with love...."104 This notion of the 248 Shema words paralleling the 248 limbs is one of the central themes in the Shema unification mystery of Rav Hamnuna Saba. A trace of the "Shema mystery of Rav Hamnuna Saba" also appears in the Shekel Shekel ha-kodesh of Rabbi Moses de Leon. Here, de Leon explicitly mentions the idea of 248 words of Shema paralleling the 248 limbs of the human body: You will find that the mystery of the Shema recitation is the formation of the [upper] Adam, which is the mystery of the 248 limbs in the human body. Therefore you will find in all the Shema recitation pericopes the mystery of 248 words; in order to construct the complete structure of the Adam, in any matter and aspect of his repair [tikkunav]. And in the Midrash Yerushalmi it is mentioned: There are 245 words [in the Shema recitation], and the prayer leader who leads the prayer repeats three words. Which are these? "YHVH, your God, true" ['YHVH 'Eloheikhem 'emet\,'emet\, in order to complete the amount of limbs. And the prayer leader com pletes the [number of] limbs for all [of the congregation] with these three words that he repeats.105 De Leon mentions here, in the name of the "Midrash Yerushalmi" (referring to the Zohar),106 the exact same Shema mystery delivered by the Yanuka in the name of his father (the Saba), as it appears in ZH Ruth.107 Furthermore, the figure .of Hamnuna Saba is mentioned in the Shekel ha-kodesh ha-kodesh only once, when referring to the Shema mystery found in the book of Hamnuna Saba: 104.

Another important source in the writings of de Leon that focuses on this unique Shema mystery appears in a fragment of his Shoshan 'edut (as found in several manuscripts). See above n. 23. Both Ta-Shma and Wolfson have shown that de Leon quotes, almost word for word, the Shema mystery that appears in ZH Ruth 77d-78a, in the name of the ancient sages [kadmonim], which refers to the Zohar.

Conclusions There is no doubt that the Zoharic author(s) created a strong connection between the Saba and Yanuka stories and their mystical homilies on the Shema mysteries. The narrative framework of these stories illuminates the mystical con tents of the Shema homilies. It is not to say the Zoharic homilies could not be understood at all in the absence of the narrative framework; but rather that a fuller and richer understanding of these homilies is lost without their narrative framework.111 One of the central dimensions that would be weakened in the absence of the narrative framework is a deeper mystical experience. As demonstrated by Hellner-Eshed, it appears that by placing the Zoharic mysteries in a narrative framework the Zohar wishes to invoke a mystical experience in its reader.112 A deeper mystical experience is achieved when the reader identifies himself with the narrative figures that embody the mystical mysteries taught by them. Thus, the reason that the Zohar creates such a strong linkage between the Shema mysteries and the Saba and Yanuka figures is to construct its reader's reli gious practice of the Shema reading by creating an identification with these narra tive figures. This identification should not be understood in the narrow literal 108. De Leon, Shekel ha-kodesh, 105-106. 109. See above n. 103. See also de Leon, Shekel ha-kodesh, 105 n. 765.

The reader becomes deeply connected to the ethos of offering one's body and limbs, and even to the most difficult of all offerings: the offering of one's own son. This element might also provide a better understanding of the ambivalent attitude of the Zohar towards the notion of human sacrifice: the idea that human sacrifice is completely forbidden, but at the same time that it also contains enormous reli gious potential, especially in the mystical yearning to unite with God.114 The main tension created here is the tension between the actual offering of human limbs and the allegoric understanding of this idea. The Zohar seems to insist on preserving the tension between the metaphoric and concrete; only by combining them can a unique Zoharic mystical experience be achieved. This combination of the allegoric and concrete is the essence of the mythical Saba and Yanuka figures. As narrative figures they exist in the concrete realm of the fictional story. But in the process of interpretation their allegoric, symbolic, and mythic aspects are revealed. Concerning these symbolic and mythic aspects of of the Yanuka and Saba figures, the words of Moses de Leon on the "Shema mystery of unity" are extremely relevant: Now, know and observe, and direct your heart to this matter.... In the two first words [YHVH, Our God )] we include two emanations [middot] together: the mystery of thought [mahshavah], as she is the first entrance,115 and the mystery of the mighty old man [ha-zaken ha-gadorfi6... to be together, and in this mystery of "We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one," [Genesis 44:20] two unique emanations [middot] which are the mystery of complete unity... only with this [the mystery of the Youth na'ar\ can you enter the high gate.

Benarroch Shema mystery of unity is deeply connected to the symbols of the "Old Man" and the "Youth" (na'ar), the father (YHVH) and the son ('Eloheinu).119 This is also a clear reference to the figure of Enoch-Metatron, who unites these two symbols, since he is identified both with "the Old Man" (Yisra'el SabaSaba—Tiferet or Ze'ir 'Anpin illuminated by 'Atika Kadisha)—and "the Youth" (Yisra'el(Yisra'el Zutta na'ar—Shekhinah).120 Both the Saba and Yanuka are identified also with the figure of Enoch-Metatron.121 The main idea here is that in order to be elevated above (during the Shema recitation) and unite with the father, the "mighty Old Man" ('Arikh 'Anpin or Hokhmah)Hokhmah)—one needs to connect first with the son (na 'ar or Shekhinah). Only through the son can one enter the gates above and go up to the father, as stated in the verse: "For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [na 'ar] be not with me?"(Genesis 44:34). This passage in Maskiyyot kesef strengthens the argument that there is a strong and deep connection between the Yanuka and Saba figures and the content of their homilies on the Shema mysteries, since their own narrative figures also represent the mythical-symbolic figures of the "Old Man," as YisraYisra 'el Saba, and the "Youth" as Yisra 'el Zutta. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the Yanuka and Saba figures are identified with these unique Zoharic Shema mysteries, as these figures act both as narrative characters and, at the same time, as mythic and symbolic figures. The Saba and Yanuka act as incarnated narrative figures of God and his son;122 their own "bodies" serving as poetic representation of the "collector of lilies," the "collector of limbs," uniting the lower and upper limbs into one mythopoetic body.
