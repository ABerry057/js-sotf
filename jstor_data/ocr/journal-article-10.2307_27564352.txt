Questions regarding the I lolocaust. from the behavior of the German soldiers, to civil ians, to the Gatholic Church, are subtly evaluated.

The book's main focus is on the cultural make-up of ancient Jewish magic, with special attention paid to processes of cross-cultural contacts and borrowings between Jews and non-Jews and to inner-Jewish creativity. Another major issue is the place of magic within Jewish society at the time, contemporary Jewish attitudes to magic and the identity of its practitioners. Throughout, Bohak explains the methodological underpinnings of all sound research in this demanding field and points out areas where further research is likely to prove fruitful. $135.00: Hardback: 978-0-521-87457-1:496 pp. Milton and the Jews Edited by Douglas A. Brooks The issue of the Jews deeply engaged Milton throughout his career, and not necessarily in ways that make for comfortable or reassuring reading today. While Shakespeare and Marlowe, for example, critiqued rather than endorsed racial and religious prejudice in their writings about Jews, the same cannot be said for Milton. The scholars in this collection confront a writer who participated in the sad history of anti Semitism, even as he appropriated Jewish models throughout his writings. Well grounded in solid historical and theological research, the essays both collectively and individually offer an important contribution to the debate on Milton and Judaism, and will inspire new directions in Milton studies. This book will be of interest not only to scholars of Milton and of seventeenth-century literature, but also to historians of the religion and culture of the period. $95.00: Hardback: 978-0-521-88883-7:240 pp. MILTON AND the jews Prices subject to change. ;si Cambridge</page><page sequence="6">OUTSTANDING SCHOLARSHIP The Politics of Jewish Commerce Economic Thought and Emancipation in Europe, 1638-1848 Jonathan Karp This study demonstrates the centrality of economic rationales to debates on Jews' status in Italy, Britain, France, and Germany during the course of two centuries.

He thus provides the first overview of the political-economic dimensions of the Jewish emancipation literature of this period viewed against the backdrop of broader controversies within European society over the effects of commerce on inherited political values and institutions. $80.00: Hardback: 978-0-521-87393-2:376 pp. Now in paperback!
