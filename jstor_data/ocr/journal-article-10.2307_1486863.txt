Conversa- tions with Dvora inevitably challenges our assumptions about the distances between art, life, and history as well as our judgments of the choices made by women of different genera- tions." -Irena Klepfisz, author of Dreams ofan Insomniac: Jewish Feminist Essays Contraversions, $45.00 cloth, $16.95 paper A Marriage Made in Heaven The Sexual Politics of Hebrew and Yiddish Naomi Seidman This sophisticated history is the first book- length exploration of the sexual politics underlying the "marriage" of Hebrew and Yiddish, and it has profound implications for understanding the construction of modern Jewish identity. Contraversions, $40.00 cloth, illustrated Medieval Stereotypes and Modern Antisemitism Robert Chazan "Chazan's highly readable work raises large questions of great contemporary interest.... No one has made the argument, at least in so direct a way, that it was in the twelfth century for the first time that Christians began to think of contemporary Jews as a fundamentally malevolent force." -Robert C.

In the course of this %0 investigation Arthur Green draws a wide arc * 0including Talmudic, Midrashic, liturgical, %I Merkavah, German Hasidic, and Kabbalistic works, showing through this single theme Sthe spectrum of devotional, mystical, and magical views held by various circles of Jews over the course of a millennium or more. "A superb contribution to the study of Jewish myth and its imaginative transformations from midrash to mysticism. Particularly significant is Green's correlation of mythic symbology with religious ritual in several his- torical periods. This work is a model of its kind." -Michael Fishbane, University of Chicago Cloth $35.00 ISBN 0-691-04372-8 Due August New in paperback The Jews of Egypt From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian Joseph Meleze Modrzejewski Translated by Robert Cornman Preface by Shaye i. D. Cohen Hellenistic Egypt was the setting for perhaps the first Jewish Golden Age, a time "golden" in Jewish memory as an era of vibrant cultural interac- tion between the Jews and their gentile hosts. This is the story of the peo- ple of Israel in the land of Egypt-the years shrouded in the mists of bibli- cal history under the Pharaohs; the strange intermezzo of the Jewish merce- nary detachment on the island of Elephantine on the upper Nile; the apogee of Jewish culture under Ptolemies; and finally, the Jewish community's rapid decline and catastrophic disappearance under Roman rule. "Urbane, intelligent, and well-researched . . . more than ample for a well-rounded view of Jewish history in ancient Egypt."-Library Journal Paper $18.95 ISBN 0-691-01 575-9 Due June Pinceon g loers I Pes AVALABE A FI EeBOKTRE0' IECL FO TEPULSHE'R*:800-7742 VIITOU W''T: UPP SNETN ID</page></plain_text>
