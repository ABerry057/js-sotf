By a close reading of the first thirty-four verses of Genesis, Norbert Samuelson lets the ideas therein contained speak in their own voice. He seeks to read nothing in and wishes to read everything out. Thus he makes a conscious decision not read these verses against other ancient Near Eastern texts nor to relate them (at first level at least) to the vast Jewish interpretative tradition. In so doing, Samuelson presents a marvelous picture of the process of creation as depicted in the verses and the lessons to be drawn from the biblical account. For Samuelson, the text is saying something in a consistent manner, and to follow his analyis word by word and verse by verse is to see his understanding of how its A/author/s differentiated space, placed the elements within that space, brought life to be, and put the human person upon the earth. For Samuelson, the exposition of the creative process not only carries with it a description of what happened at the beginning, it teaches something about the world, about society, and about the meaning of things. It teaches, according to Samuelson, that the ". .. physical universe [is] ultimately. . .intelligible" (p. 150); that that physical universe is a model of ". . . the order that human beings ought to establish in their world of the political state"" (ibid.); and that the "Bible's cosmology is remarkably contemporary" (p. 153). It is at this point that Samuelson's reader may raise some methodological questions. In the matter of reading closely, can one read a text without knowing something of its Sitz im Leben? If only to know what the words in a particular text mean, should one not know what those words mean elsewhere in a contemporaneous text and elsewhere in an earlier or later literature? True, though apparently foreswearing the use of the tradition, Samuelson does use the Midrashim and the medieval commentators to deal with certain words, the question still may be raised as to whether those separated from the text by centuries understood those words. Thus one may wonder about the very treatment of the first verse. Why should bereshit be viewed as unclear and its "translation.. .ambiguous" (p. 10)? Is Samuelson asserting that ambiguity was the intention of the A/author/s? Does the new JPS translation of "when" indicate ambiguity? It follows Rashi's translation "In the beginning of God's creation," taking bara' as if it were baro', the infinitive absolute!' Is the claim that the story teaches something of the intelligibility of the universe aided by 1. In his commentary on Gen. 1:1.</page><page sequence="3">204 BOOK REVIEWS translating bara' as 'gods?' True, the subject of the verb is always God; yet the A/author/s of Gen. 2:2-4 in paralleling the verb 'asah 'to make' to bara' sought to make the term intelligible. There are further difficulties with the treatment of bara'. As Ibn Ezra obliquely hinted2 and as H. Wolfson pointed out3 the word does not mean create out of nothing; it does mean, and here Samuelson is correct, that specific and unique activity of the Deity. However, when one looks at the root br' in other conjugations, it may be that we are not dealing with the same root but rather a homonym. Thus bari' 'healthy' may have nothing to do with bara' 'create!' It may also be that the root in the piel is a homonym and therefore 'to cut down' may have nothing to do with 'create.' The same problem of homonyms is found with the root mil. It seems quite clear that there are two different roots, the one meaning 'to rule' and the other meaning 'to compare.' While for Midrash, one can say the ". narrative [of the lighters] is a model" (p. 84); I wonder whether it can be said for philosophy. Etymologies are always problematic, particularly when one wishes to suggest derivations in translation. For the Rabbis, derivations proved that the world was created in Hebrew.4 For the modern scholar, derivations may be a matter of taste. I am not sure that "human" from "humus" is as good as 'adam from 'adamah. There is the grammatical problem of Samuelson's persistence in trans- lating verbs linked to the vav conversive as frequentative; thus, va-ya'ai '[God] makes,' va-yiqra' '[God] names,' va-yo'mer '[God] says.' Though Samuelson says that with the vav "the verb functions as if its tense were perfect," he translates as if it were imperfect. Translating verbs linked to the vav conversive into the present tense does not distinguish their time sense from participles, e.g., merahefet 'hovers.' With all these caveats, major or minor as they may be, I would say that the reader of The First Seven Days will find that s/he will look at the account of creation with different eyes. Whether one agrees with Samuelson or not, he has made he reader look at each word of the cited Torah text and not just recite that word, but really read it, read it as Samuelson does, asking 2.
