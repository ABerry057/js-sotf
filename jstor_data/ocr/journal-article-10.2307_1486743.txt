<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ivan G. Marcus. Rituals of Childhood: Jewish Acculturation in Medieval Europe. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996. xii, 191 pp. Seven Hebrew manuscripts from Germany and France of the twelfth through early fourteenth centuries-six written texts and one illustra- tion-contain descriptions of an initiation ceremony for boys of six or seven which ritualizes the transition from a child's life at home to formalized religious study in a school or synagogue setting. Three of the written descriptions and the illustration, all from Germany, link the ceremony to the festival of Shavuot, while the three manuscripts from Northern France and Provence do not locate the ritual in any particular time of year; each source, however, specifically links the initiation ceremony to the revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai. In this provocative book, Ivan Marcus argues that detailed study of the individual elements of this ritual, informed by an anthropological historical perspective, presents a new picture of medieval European Jews as having a distinctive culture which was also highly aware of and engaged by the central themes and world picture of Christianity. Using the initiation ceremony as his paradigm, Marcus makes a convincing case that through a process of "premodern" or "inward" acculturation, Ashkenazic Jews sometimes expressed elements of their Jewish religious cultural identity by internalizing and recasting particular Christian symbols or rituals in polemical, parodic, or neutralized ways. Along the way he also investigates the history of Jewish pedagogy, mnemonic gestures, and incantations against</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 127 forgetfulness, as well as long-standing connections between eating certain foods and the enhancement of Torah learning. Although details vary in the extant descriptions of the initiation ceremony, three basic elements, each of which takes place in a different social space or context, remain constant. Thus, in an initial separation from the home, the child's head and upper body are wrapped, sometimes in a tallit, and he is carried through the public streets by his father or a surrogate to the synagogue or schoolhouse. There the child is placed on the lap of a teacher who feeds the boy a honey cake and an egg, or, in some versions, three of each, on which biblical verses have been inscribed. In some of the sources an incantation against Potah, the prince of forgetfulness, is included, as is an additional element: after a study session the child participates in a ceremony at a riverbank in which the Torah is compared to life-giving water, "so that the boy should have an expanded heart" (p. 30). In his "thick description" of the initiation ritual, Marcus finds an elaborate ritualization of some key metaphors which express a social polemic against Christianity by establishing a correspondence with Christian symbolism and iconography. Thus, both the Torah and Christ are described as wheat, bread, or manna, while the frequent Jewish portrayal of the schoolchild studying Torah as a pure sacrifice bringing vicarious communal atonement offers a clear analogy to the redeeming Christ child. Similarly, the nurturing Moses/schoolteacher offers clear parallels to the nursing Madonna, while the emphasis on the ritual purification effected by the Torah as water may offer allusions to baptism. Marcus suggests that through this Jewish rite of passage, which reenacts biblical history from the Exodus through the desert journey to the reception of the Torah, the initiated child becomes a symbol of the redemptive story of the people of Israel and a polemical statement of Jewish primacy as the true Israel. Marcus finds graphic confirmation of these assertions in the one visual illustration of the ritual in the early-fourteenth-century Leipzig Mahzor, where the three stages of the school initiation are depicted alongside the giving of the Torah. He finds iconographical parallels to seated and standing Madonnas and child in both the representation of the seated teacher and child and the parental figure carrying the child in his arms, while the honey cakes which the children in the scene hold aloft are said to correspond to communion wafers. Moreover, Marcus argues that the initiation ceremony offers a further social polemic by becoming "a Jewish equivalent and answer to the eucharistic</page><page sequence="3">128 BOOK REVIEWS sacrifice by insisting that it is the study of Torah, not belief in Jesus, that brings salvation, and that Judaism and not Christianity is true" (p. 101). Marcus finds further evidence of "inward acculturation" to Christian custom in the Ashkenazic milieu both in the emergence of the initiation ceremony and in its disappearance. He suggests that the ritual's origin in the late eleventh century is connected to the contemporary Christian innovation of confirmation and first communion for children around the age of seven. Both ceremonies were administered by a religious authority figure, both took place in the spring (Shavuot/Pentecost), and both required the child to eat symbolic foods. Similarly, Marcus attributes the disappearance of the ritual and its replacement by the public rite of Bar Mitzvah not only to internal Jewish objections to some aspects of the initiation ceremony (particularly eating foods on which biblical verses were written), but to a further, thirteenth-century Christian innovation: the insistence that a child not be pledged to a convent or monastery before the age of twelve for a girl and fourteen for a boy. Marcus believes that a similar demand for reasoned consent, which created a larger span for childhood, underlies the introduction of the Bar Mitzvah in thirteenth-century Germany, at which a boy put on tefillin for the first time and received an aliyah to read the Torah in the synagogue, as the second milestone event in his life after brit milah. The Ashkenazic custom of a mother's transforming the swaddling clothes from her son's circumcision into a decorated Torah wimpel, or binder, used at the Bar Mitzvah ceremony, dramatically linked both the two rites of passage and the Jewish boy with the Torah scroll. Marcus notes that there has been scholarly resistance to the possibility that northern European rabbinic thinkers were knowledgeable about the central motifs of Christianity or that such awareness shaped medieval Jewish traditions. All readers of this slim and somewhat repetitive volume, which also questions the standard historiography of Ashkenazic vs. Sephardic models of acculturation, are likely to find such preconceptions significantly challenged.
