<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yaacov Shavit. Athens in Jerusalem. Translated by Chaya Naor and Niki Werner. London: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1997. 560 pp. Yaacov Shavit is a leading Israeli scholar of intellectual and cultural history. This work expands upon his previous studies of the ways that modem Jewish and Israeli writers have negotiated foreign and native elements in their quest to forge a new secular culture, most notably in his book on the so-called Canaanite idea in Hebrew. Here, Shavit takes the struggle over the nature of Jewish identity and locates it in a much wider intellectual context: the eternal dichotomy between Athens and Jerusalem, that is, between non-Jewish and Jewish culture. The book is an encyclopedic if not exhaustive treatment of this subject, which, in its various permutations, is the subject of modem Jewish thought.</page><page sequence="2">150 BOOK REVIEWS Shavit considers the encounter between the two sides under three major aspects. The first section of the book, by far the largest, treats writers who envisioned the two as polar opposites, irreconcilable antagonists that compel a choice between them. Part II examines scholars and visionaries who turned to the Hellenistic environment of Second Temple Judaism for a different model of cultural interaction, one allowing for coexistence and mutual influence while maintaining internal coherence. In the third part Shavit describes Western trends since the Enlightenment that have been appropriated by Jewish society. Each chapter of the book condenses an entire field of scholarship, enough to form the basis for a book of its own. Yet even while treading on familiar ground, Shavit always brings forward lesser-known documents or presents material in fresh ways, making incisive observations that will provoke readers to reconceptualize the issues. In the preface and acknowledgments, Shavit informs us that he began the book in 1986, completed the Hebrew edition in 1992, and expanded the English edition by 1996. Whether it is the product of six or ten years of labor, the prodigious scope of the book cannot but elicit astonishment and admiration. The range of subjects and fields of citation (Greek science and philosophy, German historiography and classical scholarship, Hebrew literature of the Haskalah, Zionism, and modem Jewish studies) and the variety of languages quoted (Greek, Arabic, German, Italian, French, and Latin, besides Hebrew and English) give the book the feel of a magnum opus. In an academic climate in which "small is beautiful," Shavit's book provides a stunning and welcome exception to the trend. It represents a study of modem Jewish culture encompassing the breadth of intellectual history characteristic of an earlier age of scholarship (Panofsky, Highet, Curtius, Seznec, Auerbach, etc.). Regrettably, the book contains some serious flaws that mar the success of the author's project. The writing is quite uneven and could have benefited from the kind of intensive editing no longer fashionable. One unfortunate example will have to stand for the rest: "However, the political and cultural unity of the various Hellenistic kingdoms was not based on a common territorial political consciousness, but on a cultural and political (incomplete) unity, which was founded on a link to the Hellenistic ruler" (p. 424). The use of terms is not as clear or consistent as it might have been, especially in the major categories of "Greek" and "Hellenistic"; the slippage in the use of the term "culture," even within the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 151 book's own definitions, is maddening (pp. 453-54). The author relies too heavily on lists, some of which seem highly arbitrary--on the last page alone he has three lists! Most damaging for a work of such enormous scope are the frequent jumps in logic, subject, and frame. Particularly in the first section, too often Shavit veers between writers of different times, locations, and schools with insufficient narrative guidance, so that his train of associations seems out of control. In one paragraph (pp. 230-231) he starts with Solomon Loewisohn (18th cent.), the subject of the preceding paragraph, before careening to the Mishnah (2nd cent.), Philo (1st cent.), then Mendelssohn (again 18th cent.), while the next paragraph plunges into Alexander von Humboldt (mid-19th cent.). The narrative line is not sufficiently strong to maintain clarity and consistency through such jolts. Consequently, this book is impossible to read straight through, which differentiates it from its nimble (and august) models. In terms of structure, the three main sections are not justified and developed clearly enough. Surely, for a book of this magnitude, each section should have its own introduction explaining its distinguishing contours; section II comes closest to offering that, while the third part dispenses with all preliminaries. An additional confusion arises from jumbling together different layers of the discussion, especially in the second section, in which historians' claims about Hellenistic Judaism, ideologies and movements based on an image of that society, and Shavit's own evaluation of the historical reality are tossed together. In short, the book does not steer the reader through its innumerable thickets and detours as capably and seamlessly as it should have. Nonetheless, Athens in Jerusalem can prove profitable to scholars and students alike. Readers will do best by choosing an individual chapter and trying their luck. Despite the unevenness, all of the chapters contain a rich trove of information and observations; the footnotes and quotations alone are worth the price of admission. One only wishes that Shavit and his editors had taken the time to produce the outstanding resource that the book might have been.
