<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY IN THE HASKALAH PERIOD by YAIR MAZOR Art in general, and art of fiction in particular, stands or falls on organization. -Victor Sklovskij Preface The main goal of this paper is to determine and describe the poetics of composition of the Hebrew short story in the Enlightenment (Haskalah) period. (The Haskalah was a major literary movement in Hebrew literature, mainly in Germany, Austria, and Russia, from 1780 to 1870. This move- ment evolved in three distinct phases: neoclassic, romantic, and realistic.) The narrative of the Haskalah period has received considerable attention from many critics and researchers, beginning with the first critics of Hebrew literature (such as Kovner, Brainin, Paperna, and Lilienblum), through critics of the early twentieth century (such as Feitelson, Robinson, Zitron, Zinberg, Frischmann, Slouschz, Shapira, Klausner, and Lachower), up to 89</page><page sequence="2">90 YAIR MAZOR contemporary critics (Patterson, Weinfeld, Wersses, Shaked, Miron, Fein- gold, and others).' However, all the above-mentioned critics have most often concentrated either on a particular literary piece or on a major aesthetic element found in a work of one of the Haskalah authors. Thus, none of them made a signifi- cant attempt to reconstruct the coherent compositional poetics of the Haskalah narrative. Indeed, though one may find in these critics some useful and illuminating observations relating to Haskalah prose fiction, these cannot substitute for a detailed description of the actual poetics.2 Further- more, previous research and criticism of the corpus of Haskalah fiction did not make a distinction between the compositional poetics of the Haskalah novel and those of the Haskalah short story. One of the major assumptions of the present study is that this kind of distinction must be made, since the Haskalah short story displays a different poetics of composition from that of the Haskalah novel. Indeed, previous Haskalah criticism correctly pointed out many weak- nesses in numerous Haskalah compositions: loose organization; too many interwoven plots loosely or artificially connected; and the narrator's exces- sive intrusions into the plot with unrelated didactic sermons. All these faults can be found in the Haskalah narrative, but almost exclusively in the novels.3 The short stories of this period demonstrate a drastically different compositional method, a difference which demands a reevaluation of the period's compositional poetics. The present paper attempts to show that in addition to the poetics of the Haskalah novel, there exists a different compositional poetics (for the Haskalah short story) which is complicated, varied, and aesthetically impressive. As has been mentioned above, in dealing with Haskalah fiction, we are 1. The specific works of all these critics are mentioned in the course of this paper. 2. For instance, the most useful generations summarized by Shaked; see Gershon Shaked, Ha-Sipporet ha-Ivrit 1880-1970 [The Hebrew narrative 1880-1970] (Tel Aviv: Keter ha-Kibbutz ha-Me'uhad, 1928), pp. 48-51. 3. Although these weaknesses in numerous novels in the corpus are undoubtedly not to be denied, many of the novels which carry these compositional faults also include many other compositional phenomena which are highly impressive and well wrought. Thus, the obvious weaknesses in these novels led most critics to make normative generalizations and to abandon any discussion of other compositional phenomena that exist in the same corpus and deserve a favorable evaluation. This issue has been discussed in detail in Yair Mazor, "Aspects and Trends in the Poetics of Composition in Hebrew Realistic Narrative in the Enlightenment Period" [Hebrew] (doctoral diss., Tel Aviv University, 1981).</page><page sequence="3">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 91 actually dealing with the realistic period of Hebrew Enlightenment litera- ture, a literary period in Eastern Europe during the years 1833-1881.4 During this period, the major aim of Hebrew literature was a didactic one: to demolish the walls of the Jewish social-mental "ghetto"; to urge the Jew to adopt a new spirit, a spirit of enlightenment, and to extricate himself from his bleak reality. This was the period which gave rise to the most significant Hebrew narrative of the nineteenth century, the period in which Hebrew narrative was, in fact, first established. This phenomenon is easily under- stood, since the nature of narrative-and especially of the novel-lends itself to the reflection of current life, the "here and now"; as Henry James put it: "A novel is in its broadest definition a personal, direct impression of life."' James also states, "I may therefore venture to say that the air of reality (solidity of specification) seems to me to be the supreme virtue of the novel."6 Hence, when we deal with the Haskalah short story we deal with the realistic story. The precise nature of the realism expressed in the works of this literary period is an issue of debate. Shapira claims that the realism of this period is not a "pure" realism, since it is strongly didactic; the literary works do deal with reality, but not always with the techniques of literary realism.7 Halkin prefers the term "actualism," or "struggling actualism."8 Ewen calls it "historical realism,"' and Shaanan prefers "critical realism"' (a term first used by V. L. Parrington)." But this division of opinion is predictable, since it seems that the number of definitions of the term "realism" is equal to the number of researchers who deal with literary 4. Klausner was the critic who outlined the "period of the Hebrew realistic literature"-as he puts it-to these exact years; see Joseph Klausner, Historyah shel ha-Sifrut ha-Ivrit ha-fladashah [History of modern Hebrew literature] (Jerusalem: Achisaph, 1955), vol. 3, p. 350. 5.

Frye, Wellek, Levin, Jakobson, Ewen, Brinker, and many other critics all agree that "realism" is one of the vaguest and most ambiguous terms in the history of criticism.12 D. Grant, in his book dedicated to the meaning of "realism," gives twenty-six different definitions of this elusive term.' However, the division of opinion concerning the nature of the realism of the Haskalah realistic narrative does not eclipse the substantial aesthetic and ideological similarities of the prominent authors of this period. In this sense the era of Haskalah realistic narrative fits Wellek and Warren's defini- tion of the literary period of Russian formalism: "a time section defined by a system of norms embedded in the historical process and irremovable from it.",14 The most recognizable authors of this literary period are Smolenskin, Braudes, Brandstaedter, Gottlober, Y. L. Gordon, and E. Schulmann. One may also include Mapu and Mendele Mokher Seforim (Abramovitsch), who are perhaps the most distinguished authors of Hebrew Enlightenment litera- ture. Mapu was the author of the first Hebrew novel, Ahavat-Ziyyon ("Love for Zion," 1830). Mapu also wrote the first realistic Hebrew novel, Ayit Zavu'a ("The Hypocrite," 1875). However, this novel is still strongly anchored in historical-romantic conventions. The step toward realism which was taken in this novel is frail and hesitant. Essentially, then, Mapu's literary work is mainly rooted in the romantic period of Haskalah literature. Mendele was the one who extricated and freed the Hebrew novel from its weaknesses (especially of language, which was mostly inflexible, using bib- lical patterns of speech in a clumsy, clich6d way). Mendele's Limmedu Heitev ("Study Well," 1862), the first modern Hebrew novel, achieved an aesthetic complexity never reached before. This novel was republished six years later (1868) with many improvements under a new title (A vot u- Vanim; "Fathers and Sons"). But quite soon afterwards, Mendele abandoned writing in Hebrew, and for about twenty years wrote exclusively in Yiddish. When he 12.

Smolenskin and Braudes composed short stories as well as novels, but their fame is mostly due to their novels. Their short stories are usually regarded as the less significant parts of their literary creation. Y. L. Gordon was perhaps the most prominent poet of the Haskalah period, but, as we shall see, he also wrote short stories which merit esteem. Gottlober, who owes his fame mainly to his poetry, and Schulmann, who owes his fame mainly to his literary-historical research, wrote short stories which could definitely contribute to their reputations, if only they were known. Of all the above-mentioned writers, Brandstaedter is the only one mainly recognized for his short stories, with their delicate humor and well-wrought satire highly praised by the critics.'" Therefore, the reconstruction of the poetics of composition of the Haskalah short story in this paper is also a recompense for a significant stratum of Hebrew literature that has been unjustifiably forgotten. Compositional Poetics of the Haskalah Short Story: Major Latitudes and Meridians Since one of the major goals of this study is to make a distinction between the poetics of composition of the Haskalah novel and that of the Haskalah short story, it seems appropriate to emphasize the main differ- ences between these two poetics. Let us look first at plot structure. The plots of many of the Haskalah novels consist of interwoven strands loosely or artificially connected, and lacking a logical and thorough development. Many of these plots are overloaded with exceedingly complicated and 15.

Anyone reading, for instance, Smolenskin's Ha-To'eh be-Darkhei ha-IHayyim ("The Wanderer in Life's Ways") cannot avoid these many obstacles; considerable effort is demanded for an adequate comprehension of the novel's fictional world. Another aspect of the Haskalah novel's plot structure is the large number of heroes in any one plot. Halfway through reading Mapu's Ayit Zavu'a ("The Hypocrite"), for example, one can hardly remember the almost countless figures who appear, disappear, and reappear. Admittedly, Ayit Zavu'a is the very first Haskalah realistic novel, and therefore the aesthetic conventions of Haskalah realism are far from being achieved and established. Thus, one may claim that this novel is not a suitable example. But its too large fictional "population" unfortunately acted as a model for imitation for many years and novels to come.'6 Another element in the poetics of the Hebrew Haskalah novel is its strong didacticism. Smolenskin, for instance, claimed that he gave the very same priority to the didactic level of his novels as he did to the aesthetic level. In a letter to David Kaufmann, he emphasized that "the story is, in contrast to the opinion of the French (also shared by Spielhagen), not only for entertainment, but for teaching a lesson, but not through a thorough investigation like the research books, but in a way which combines the useful and the pleasant."'7 Although not all the Haskalah authors expressed their ars poetica as clearly as Smolenskin did, the strongly didactic character of their works indicates that they shared the very same idea. The authors of the Haskalah novel wished to preach through their works in order to pull away from the "mental ghetto" in which the Jews had been isolated and locked for hundreds of years, and in order to expose their readers to the liberating ideas of the Enlightenment. The author of the Haskalah novel was therefore an educator no less than he was an author; and sometimes, regretfully indeed, even more so. His efforts to persuade, to teach, to preach through his literary work often became one of the most disturbing literary weaknesses of the piece, for the authors did not always succeed in maintaining the delicate balance between aesthetic texture and 16. Shaanan summarizes the many aspects of this compositional error in Ayit Zavua; see Shaanan, Ha-Sifrut ha-Ivrit ha-Hadashah li'Zerameha, vol. 1, p. 235. 17.

The narrator's often uncontrollable "invasions" into the plot, with didactic sermons having no connection to the fictional events, interfered with the plot to such a degree that they threatened the quality of the whole piece, creating the impression that the novel was patched together rather than woven of whole cloth. However, many Haskalah novels of the period here discussed demon- strate not only compositional flaws but also rather impressive composi- tional devices and patterns.'8 But these compositional achievements, as impressive as they are, cannot cancel-or even hide-the poor impression created by the above-mentioned weaknesses of the plot, especially since the plot is one of the most prominent components of a novel. On the other hand, the plot of the Haskalah short story shows such weaknesses only rarely. It seems rather easy, therefore, to designate the compositional poetics of the Haskalah short story as the positive "alter ego" of the compositional poetics of the Haskalah novel. Many of the Haskalah novel's compositional weaknesses are put right in the Haskalah short story. The plot is usually well organized and unified, and its events are causally connected and woven into a planned developmental sequence. The narrator is controlled, avoids rending the plot by didactic "invasions," and protects the delicate balance between the aesthetic stratum and the educational message. The fictional figures are reasonably delineated in a way that contri- butes to the unity of the plot and makes the story more flexible, persuasive. But the special feel of the compositional poetics of the Haskalah short story goes far beyond the phenomena mentioned above. Among the specific compositional devices, patterns, and constructions which serve both the didactic and the aesthetic level of the stories and establish the unique charac- ter of the pieces are intentional retardation,19 the suspension of expositional and informative materials,20 the use of informational gaps for establishing 18. See Mazor, "Aspects and Trends in the Poetics of Composition," esp. pp. 23-33, 49-50, 55-56, 58-62, 66-67, 90-109, 114-126, 141-181. 19. About literary retardation and its aesthetic functions, see Victor Erlich, Russian Formalism (The Hague and Paris: Mouton, 1969). 20. The suspension of expositional information as a literary device was first discussed by the Russian formalists; see T. L. Lemon and N. J. Reis, eds., Russian Formalist Criticism, p. 73. Later this phenomenon was discussed by the following: Roman Ingarden, The Literary Work of Art, trans. G. G. Grabowicz (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 38-40; C. M. Beardsley, Aesthetics (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1958), pp. 242-245; Wolfgang Iser, "Indeterminancy and the Reader's Response in Prose-Fiction," in Aspects of Narrrative, ed. J. H. Miller (New York: Columbia University Press, 1971), p. 8. A very detailed discussion of this compositional phenomenon is to be found in Meir Sternberg, Expositional</page><page sequence="8">96 YAIR MAZOR both curiosity and tension, various kinds of analogies,2' manipulation of the order of the fabula with a sujet which does not follow the chronological sequence of events,22 a dynamic characterization that efficiently uses the dynamics of the literary sequence,23 and intentional use of the tension between showing and telling,24 between narrative time and narrated time.25 Although these compositional phenomena can also be found in some Haskalah novels, they are found only infrequently. In addition, there are two significant facts that maintain the considerable differences between the compositional poetics of the Haskalah novel and that of the Haskalah short story. As discussed above, the plot and the unity of the Haskalah novel are often severely damaged because of the lack of balance between its didactic Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978), pp. 50-53. 21. The first critic who systematically dealt with the analogy as a major compositional pattern was Fergusson; see Francis Fergusson, The Idea of a Theater (New York: Doubleday, 1949), pp. 109-110, 114-123, 139-144. The concept of the analogy was thoroughly developed by Empson; see William Empson, Some Versions of Pastoral (New York: New Directions, 1950), pp. 27-88. The phenomenon of the analogy in the English novel has been discussed by Richard Stang, The Theory of the Novel in England 1850-1870 (New York: Columbia Univer- sity Press, 1971), pp. 15-133. 22. Fabula-the chronological sequence of the fictional events in the piece. Sujet-the sequence of the fictional events as it is wrought and presented in the piece, which in many cases contradicts the chronological sequence. A well-known example of manipulation of the sujet in the order of the Jabula is the opening of the piece in medias res. See Lemon and Reis, Russian Formalist Criticism, p. 63. E. M. Forster translated fabula as "story" and sujet as "plot"; but this seems to be a rather confusing translation, as Forster admits to another meaning of the terms; see E. M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel (London, 1961), p. 35. 23. The first critic to discuss the dynamic nature of the literary text was Lessing; see G. E. Lessing, Laocoon (1766; New York: Noonday Press, 1957). The first modern critics to deal with the dynamics of the literary text were Ingarden, Mukarovsky, and Tynjanov; see Ingarden, Literary Work of Art, pp. 9-145; Jan Mukarovsky, On Poetic Language, trans. and ed. J. Burbank and P. Steiner (1940; Lisse: Peter de Ridder Press, 1976), pp. 50-59; Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," in Criticism, ed. M. Schorer (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1958), pp. 379-392; S. E. Fish, "Literature and the Reader: Effective Stylis- tics," New Literary History 2, no. 1 (Autumn 1920): 123-162, Iser, "Indeterminancy and the Reader's Response," 1-45. This issue has been impressively developed by Menachem Perry in many works; see esp. Perry, "The Dynamics of the Literary Text" [Hebrew], Ha-Sifrut, no. 28 (April 1929), pp. 6-46. A book which is wholly dedicated to this topic is Yair Mazor, The Dynamics of Motifs in Selected Works of S. Y. Agnon [Hebrew] (Tel Aviv: Dekel Academic Press, 1979). 24. An adequate discussion of these terms and their literary functions will be found in W. C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961), pp. 3-20. Also see Percy Lubock, The Craft of Fiction (New York: Viking Press, 1963), p. 110. 25. Narrative time-the duration of the narrative process; narrated time-the duration of the narrated material.

Since the plot and the novel's compositional unity are the major sources of the structural impact of the piece, flaws in these areas overshadow even the most attractive composi- tional achievements. Also, the fact that the range of the novel is much wider than the range of the short story does not enable isolated compositional devices and patterns to be made conspicuous, as happens in the short story. Hence, the very same compositional pattern that resounds mightily in the short story is likely to create a rather modest impression in a wide-ranging novel, especially in one with a defective plot. Considering the well-wrought plot (generally speaking, of course) of the Haskalah short story, its capacity to maintain a satisfactory balance be- tween didactic and aesthetic elements, and its efficiency in using various compositional devices and patterns, one cannot deny the laudable nature of the poetics of composition of the Haskalah short story. Compositional Poetics of the Haskalah Short Story: Selected Examples It is obvious that a complete description of the poetics of composition of the Haskalah short story is beyond the capacity of a single paper. So let me again note that the principal aim of this article is to provide a basic composi- tional "portrait" of the Haskalah short story through exemplification of some of its more important aspects. Hence, in the three following sections, using Brandstaedter, Schulmann, and Gottlober as our exemplars, we will concentrate on the compositional aspects of three Haskalah short stories, one by each of these writers. Although this selection is rather modest in its range, the compositional phenomena to be discussed are typical of many Haskalah short stories, and therefore, their presentation can shed light on some of the most attractive aspects of the compositional features of the Haskalah short story. Retardation in Brandstaedter's "Zorer ha- Yehudim ba-Ir Grileb" Brandstaedter's "Zorer ha-Yehudim ba-Ir Grileb" ("The Foe of the Jews in the Town of Grileb")26 seems at first a very simple and uncompli- 26.

And it is, at least from the standpoint of its content. It is a story about a young man named Shelomoh, who becomes acquainted with the governor of his hometown, Grileb. The governor is notorious for his deep disdain of the Jews, but as their friendship grows, Shelomoh discovers that this "foe of the Jews" is, as a matter of fact, a most charming young man, highly educated, who tries to do his best for the town. Shelomoh realizes that the governor's many demands-such as that the market and the streets be cleaned-have been wrongly regarded by the Jews as unreasonable, and consequently they have incorrectly assumed that he is a "foe of the Jews." Young Shelomoh, who detests the atmosphere of the Jewish mental ghetto, and longs for contact with nonreligious Enlightenment culture, finds in the governor a truthful friend, pleasant and inspiring. The governor, fully aware of Shelomoh's eagerness for education, encourages him, and gives him many books which open new horizons to him. Toward the end of the story, a suspended expositional element is revealed: the supposed "foe of the Jews" is Jewish himself. The suspension of this expositional information permits the poenta (epiphany) at the end of the story and also moves the plot toward its end: the governor marries Shelomoh's sister. Indeed, despite the efficient functioning of the delaying device (the suspension of expositional information until the story's end), the story's plot does not seem impressive at all: it is rather banal and the content is rather trite. But a closer look at the story's compo- sition reveals the skillfulness of its construction. An illuminating example of the compositional quality of this story can be demonstrated by its use of retardation. Retardation is usually defined as a compositional device based on cutting off the plot's sequence and conse- quently suspending its development (usually at a point of tension in the plot). This is done by interjecting a paragraph which is detached from the plot, or whose place in the plot is, for the moment, concealed. In many cases, retardation is used to increase the plot's tension: plot development is suspended at a certain climactic point, creating a desire in the reader for its resolution but for which he has to wait. However, the retardation device can also be used for other aesthetic goals, as is demon- strated in the story under consideration. As Shelomoh is walking along and talking with the "foe of the Jews," he is surprised to find out that "scholarly books had also been written in the German language" (p. 132). Until this point he has been convinced that all books in the German language "are fictional stories which narrate events and deeds that never happened" (ibid.). Shelomoh demonstrates this inno-</page><page sequence="11">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 99 cent conception about German books by telling the governor the plot of one of the German novels which he has recently read. As Shelomoh starts telling the plot of this novel, the reader easily recog- nizes it as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. Shelomoh, who is intrigued by the story of this novel, finds pleasure in narrating it in a very detailed way. As Shelomoh tells Dumas's story, his own story's plot is interrupted. The plot of The Count of Monte Cristo thus functions as a long retardation paragraph (pp. 132-133). At this point the reader may wonder what the author's intention was in relating in such detail the plot of The Count of Monte Cristo in the middle of his story, especially since it is likely that the governor, as well as the reader (both of whom listen to Shelomoh's story), are well acquainted with the plot of The Count of Monte Cristo. The penetration of this retardation section into the story becomes even more curious as one considers the obvious discontinuity of the two stories: what on earth can be the connection between the adventures of the Count of Monte Cristo and Jewish life in Eastern Europe? In fact, the inclusion of this material may, at first, seem a compositional error of an author who cannot control his own medium. But a closer look reveals a significant parallel between the retardation and the suspension of the story's plot. As surprising as it may seem, the adventures of the Count of Monte Cristo echo the way of Shelomoh, the young Jew who is avid for cultural enlightenment. This unexpected parallel is revealed in the major elements of the Count's agonizing adventure: he is a young man who is forced to enter a dark dungeon but, thanks to his friendship with a kind and generous older man, finds his way out of prison. We realize that Shelomoh is also a young man forced to be in a "dungeon"-the dungeon of ignorance, the dungeon of an environment which tries to prevent his escape to cultural enlighten- ment. The parallel between the concrete dungeon of the Count of Monte Cristo and the metaphorical one of Shelomoh is emphasized by a verbal parallel: the very same word, bor ("pit"), is used for describing both the Count's physical prison and Shelomoh's psychological and cultural prison (see pp. 127, 132). The parallel between the plot of the novel about the Count and Shelomoh's own story continues: the way in which the Count escapes his prison-by means of his friendship with his older, generous guardian-is repeated in Shelomoh's case. Shelomoh's friendship with the governor-the "foe of the Jews," who becomes his guide and gives him books, good advice-leads him from his cultural prison to the longed-for enlightenment. Hence, the retardation, which at first seems totally separate from the</page><page sequence="12">100 YAIR MAZOR story's fictional world, is revealed to be a most relevant piece of fictional material indeed. It functions as a metaphor, as a mirror which reflects the main ideological issue of the story. It is an exhortation to abandon the Jewish mental ghetto and expose oneself to the cultural advantages of the nonreligious Enlightenment. In addition, the parallels between the retardational material and the story which it interrupts reinforce the positive role of the supposed "foe of the Jews." This, in turn, reinforces another ideological point of the story: the "implied author's" rejection of the prejudices of the Jewish community against those who attempt to free themselves from their mental ghetto. Hence, the retardation based on the adventure of the Count of Monte Cristo functions at both the aesthetic and the didactic level of the story: it contributes to the story's complexity without damaging its unity; and it emphasizes and enriches the didactic message. Beyond the first impression of a clumsy author who loses control of his own medium, another author is discovered: one who is sophisticated, sharp, and sensitive. Transformative Analogy in Schulmann's "Emanuel" E. Schulmann's story "Emanuel"27 also does not at first seem particular- ly impressive, especially from the standpoint of content. The traditional platitudinous Haskalah themes are repeated in this modest story, almost tiresomely: love, frustrated love, searching for love, neglected tradition, and the search for enlightenment. The story is based on two figures: Emanuel, the rejected poet and lover, whose frustrated love for Mathilda leads him to an agonizing death; and Mathilda, a frustrated actress, who rejects Emanuel's love but at the same time is rejected by her Christian lover, the prince, and consequently is also driven to a grim death. Indeed, this kind of content does have but a humble appeal. But once again, the compositional character of the story makes the difference between a tiresome story and a sophisticated one. The compositional basis of the story is the analogy. At the very beginning of the story, a most obvious contrasting analogy is established between the two major protagonists: Emanuel and Mathilda.

Mathilda seems to be his complete opposite: she is cheerful, full of joie de vivre, extremely attractive, graceful, and seems most sure of herself. Indeed, one cannot imagine a sharper contrast between two human beings. But further reading into the story leads the reader to an unexpected discovery: the analogy that seems clearly one of contrast is gradually revealed to be an analogy of parallels. Systematically, the narrator gradually spreads throughout the story elements which expose many threads of parallelism between Mathilda and Emanuel, and in this way gradually closes the gap between them. This surprising change takes place in six well-planned stages. In each stage, another aspect of similarity between Emanuel and Mathilda is revealed by the narrator; thus, the scattering of the relevant information throughout the text is carried out by a highly conscious author, who skillful- ly masters his medium in order to achieve certain aesthetic-didactic goals. As mentioned above, Mathilda has suffered a humiliating failure as an actress. As she confesses, her name has become "disgracefully notorious" (p. 14) because of her poor performance. This fact about Mathilda forms a parallel with Emanuel in the first stage of the analogy's process of change. The reader is informed of a similar artistic failure experienced by Emanuel: like Mathilda, who was actually expelled from the theater's stage, Emanuel was expelled from the editor's office because of his rejected poetry. Mathilda and Emanuel are both denied and humiliated as a reward for their artistic performances. In the second stage of the analogy's process of change, a thread of simi- larity between Mathilda and Emanuel is revealed in the personal aspect of their lives. As already noted, Emanuel is unhappy in his personal life: his love for Mathilda has been hopelessly rejected. This emotional misfortune is also shared by Mathilda, who complains: "Shall I seek love? Love touched my heart three times and always increased my pain!" (p. 15).28 In the third stage of the analogy's process of change, the thread of similarity between Mathilda and Emanuel in the artistic aspect becomes clearer. The narrator reveals here that Emanuel too has suffered a failure in the theater, exactly as Mathilda has. This new thread of similarity between them is emphasized by a verbal parallelism. When Mathilda tells about her failure as an actress, she says: ". . . and it turned to calamity!" (p. 14). The 28. All translations from the Hebrew have been done by this writer-Y.M.</page><page sequence="14">102 YAIR MAZOR very same expression (Heb. balahot) is used by Emanuel when he tells about his own failure as an actor (p. 25). In the fourth stage of the process of the analogy's change, an ideological parallelism is discovered between Emanuel and Mathilda: they both reject the conservative Jewish tradition, the conformist Jewish way of life, and they both prefer, instead, the nonreligious cultural life. Emanuel declares his disappointment with the Jewish religion (p. 21), and Mathilda declares the same in a deed: she is to marry a Christian prince (p. 27). The fifth stage of the analogy's change is closely related to the previous one. As mentioned above, Mathilda falls in love .with a Christian prince. Emanuel had himself once been in love with a Christian princess (p. 25). This leads directly to the coming and final stage in the process of the analogy's change: Mathilda does not find happiness in her "forbidden" love, and it pushes her to a gloomy death (p. 29). And Emanuel's "forbid- den" love becomes an everlasting source of grief which eventually pulls him toward a bleak death (p. 28). Hence, the threads of parallelism between Emanuel and Mathilda, which are gradually exposed in the six stages of the analogy's change, relate to various aspects of their lives: the artistic, the personal, the emotional, and the ideological. In this way, the "conventional-direct" analogy between them becomes as firm as possible. It is a fact of rhetorical importance that this conventional analogy between them is shaped in the light of the previously contrasting analogy between them, a contrast which had seemed so obviously accurate. What is the aesthetic function of such a shift? Any change in the contrasting analogy which belies its first impression runs the risk of loosing the reader's credibi- lity. Hence, this surprising change is made by degrees, through six stages, which soften the drastic nature of the change, enabling the reader to "digest" the new information, without rejecting it as unreliable. The author displays here an impressive capacity for using the dynamic nature of the literary text-based on verbal components which come in a diachronic sequential order-for giving his story an impressive rhetorical-aesthetic character. As already noted, the didactic message is a prominent component of the Haskalah narrative. The story here discussed is no exception. The didactic message of this story is clearly expressed by the rabbi (to whom both Emanuel and Mathilda come and confess their misfortunes). The rabbi complains about young people (represented by both Emanuel and Mathil- da) who neglect the Jewish heritage for misleading nonreligious challenges</page><page sequence="15">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 103 (p. 29). The risk and misfortune which follow those who abandon the tradi- tional, secure Jewish way of life become the basis of the author's didactic message. Here, the author again demonstrates his impressive artistic skills. He escapes the temptation to preach directly. Thus he avoids violating the plot's sequence and damaging its unity. Schulmann chooses an effective way to combine his ideological message with his plot; he blends and assimilates the didactic message into the fictional world of the story, using the device of the dynamic, transformative analogy as an aesthetic vehicle which demonstrates the didactic message. Changing the contrasting analogy between Emanuel and Mathilda into a direct, conventional analogy emphasizes the shared aspect of their fate: they both choose to deny their heritage, and they both reach an unfortunate end as a consequence of their choice. Hence, the surprising transition from contrasting analogy to persuasive parallelism draws sharp attention to the common destiny of Mathilda and Emanuel. Since their bleak fate reflects the major didactic message of the novel, the dynamic character of the analogy in the story becomes a most efficient literary means for revealing the basic ideological stratum of the story. Schulmann here disproves the idea that the artistic and didactic needs of a piece must conflict; a gifted author can find a way to anchor his didactic views in his piece without reducing its aesthetic values. Schulmann, instead of damaging his piece's unity, achieves two unities: he keeps the aesthetic unity of the fictional world, and adds to it the unity between the aesthetic level and the didactic level of the piece. In Schulmann's literary creation, the compositional medium becomes the message. Order of Presentation in Gottlober's "Kol Rinnah Vishuah be-Ohalei Zaddikim " Gottlober's "Kol Rinnah Vishuah be-Ohalei Zaddikim" ("Voice of Rejoicing and Salvation in the Tents of the Righteous")29 is yet another example of the intentional capacity of the Haskalah short story to effectively use compositional devices in order to serve both aesthetic and ideological levels. The compositional device to be discussed here is based on the dynamic character of the literary text, a verbal sequence in which the 29.

Hence, the order in which the fictional information is pre- sented is a source of various aesthetic patterns and literary devices. Every literary text is organized in two principal ways. The Russian for- malists titled these two types of presentation the fabula and the sujet.30 The jfbula is the chronological order of the events in the piece. The sujet is the order in which the fictional events are presented in the piece. The differentia- tion between these two kinds of orders indicates that the order in which th6 fictional events are presented (sujet) is not necessarily congruent to the chronological order in which the fictional events "occurred." Indeed, it is not easy to find a narrative in which the sujet does obey the fabula's order. Starting a piece in medias res is one well-known example of deviation of the sujet from the order dictated by the fabula. Another common device in which the sujet changes thefabula's order is that of postponing information which should be revealed earlier, according to its place in thefabula. The suspension of expositional information is one example of a device which increases the reader's curiosity, and at the same time draws attention to the suspended expositional information. The latter purpose of this device is one of special importance. In itself the expositional information may not be of great interest to the reader, since it is subordi- nated to the main plot, which is the center of the reader's attention. However, it may contain information necessary to a clear understanding of the background of the story. Thus, when the information is withheld, the rhetorical attraction of the expositional information is increased. The sujet's distortion of the fabula's order can also occur by way of an early delivery of information which belongs much later in the fabula's sequence; for instance, opening the piece with an occasion which ends the chronological evolution of the fictional events. The opening of Nabokov's Lolita with Humbert's testimony in court, which is the very end of the novel's fabula, is one illustration of such a case. The early placement of a piece of fictional information in the story's sequence which, according to the chronological order of the fabula, should come much later, can strongly influence and direct the reader's process of perception. This is the case in Gottlober's "Voice of Rejoicing and Salvation in the Tents of the Right- eous. In this story, the deviation of the sujet's order from that of the fabula produces a "too early" exposition of a piece of fictional information; in this 30. See above, n. 22.</page><page sequence="17">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 105 way, the reader is intentionally misled by the author, who seeks thus to attract the reader's attention to the main "message" of the story. Here again, the compositional poetics of the Haskalah short story is rediscovered as a sophisticated aesthetic efficiently serving the main ideolo- gical goal of the piece. This story deals-as do many Haskalah stories-with the misfortune of the Jewish community in Russia. This community is forced to deliver a certain percentage of its youth to the tsar's army. The main figure in the story's plot is Hayyim-Michael, the spiritual leader of the Jewish congregation, who is required by the authorities to select those to be sent for this agonizing service. The story opens with a joyous drinking party given by .Hayyim-Michael for his community. Hayyim-Michael emphasizes the reason for the drink- ing party: he has succeeded in obtaining a cancellation of the wicked decree of the tsar, and thus has freed his congregation from the painful task of delivering their youth to the tsar's service. H.ayyim-Michael appears exceedingly cheerful at the drinking party: he is walking around, toasting and encouraging the others to drink as much liquor as possible (p. 157). In the fabula, the drinking party is located toward the end of the events' deve- lopment. This deviation from thefabula's order has a fundamental influence on the reader's response, on his process of comprehension of the story. As the reader follows the story, he is informed in detail of the tsar's restrictive law and the attempt of the Jewish community to escape it. With his knowl- edge of the cheerful drinking party given by Hayyim-Michael to celebrate the revocation of the threatening law, which opens the story, the reader willingly concludes the following: the cheerful party must be the joyful conclusion of the plot, and therefore, no matter how gloomy and depressing the coming plot's events, a "happy ending" is promised. It is hard to reject the conclusion that the author intentionally distorted thefabula's order in the sujet so as to calm the reader's natural fears about a possible bleak ending, thus enabling him to concentrate on the plot's development. The sujet's manipulation of the fabula also encourages the reader to see Hayyim-Michael in a favorable light. The way he stimulates his people to toast at the drinking party paints him as a father-figure, caring for every- one. Only the plot's later development begins to show how erroneous is the impression, how misleading the optimistic expectation that the reader was encouraged to adopt. Right after the opening of the story, the sujet begins to follow the Jabula's order, and the plot's events are narrated according to the "correct" chronological order. Gradually, the real nature of Hayyim-Michael is</page><page sequence="18">106 YAIR MAZOR exposed, and the sympathetic first impression is replaced by dislike of his deceitful mask. He is revealed to be a wicked man, using any means for the sake of achieving his own purposes. He cynically uses his community's distress as an endless source for commiting his crimes against them. The climax of this process of tearing off HIayyim-Michael's disguise is reached in a second description of the same drinking party. This time, the party is placed in the sujet according to thefabula's order. But that is only the smallest part of the difference. When the reader is again told of the drinking party given by Hayyim-Michael for his community, he cannot escape the suspicion that Hayyim-Michael's intentions are far from proper and noble. The accumulated information about .Hayyim-Michael, with which the reader has become acquainted between the two presentations of the drinking party, strongly encourages him to assume that Hayyim- Michael has some underhanded reasons for giving the party. And indeed, the text confirms this suspicion. As the drinking party continues, the narrator inserts a conversation between two of Hayyim- Michael's followers, revealing his evil plan: "all the town's people are exceedingly intoxicated, and many of them are still drinking. Even those whom I trapped are not aware of their misfortune, as they are also heavily drunk, and they are lying unconscious in the dungeon. Tomorrow they will find out what happened to them and their rejoicing will be over. Alas for them, as their fate is bitter!" (p. 194). Now, Hayyim-Michael's vicious plan is completely clear. Required to select some of the congregation's youth for the tsar's military service, he has foreseen enormous difficulties in carrying out his orders. Each family would probably fight back bitterly to prevent its son being taken away. Therefore, Hayyim-Michael chose the easy way, which was evil indeed. He misled the community into believing that the tsar's order was cancelled, and tempted everybody to participate in a party, encouraging the guests to drink as much as possible. As they got drunk, he intended to send his fol- lowers to select the needed number of young men and imprison them for later transferral to the tsar's authorities. Now the reader fully comprehends how he has misunderstood the true meaning of the drinking party. Now the reader is fully aware that his optimism has misled him. The reader's acquaintance with the true meaning of the drinking party forces him to turn back to the very beginning of the story, to the first presen- tation of the drinking party; he drops his erroneously optimistic reading of the party, and replaces it with the true, dark one. W. Iser once described the</page><page sequence="19">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 107 reading process in this way: "The act of reaction is not a smooth or continu- ous process, but one which, in its essence, relies on interruptions of the flow to render it efficacious. We look forward, we look back, we change our decisions, we form expectations, we question, we muse, we accept, we reject; this is the dynamic process of reaction."9' In the case discussed, Gottlober demonstrates a remarkable capacity for fully employing the dynamic characteristic of the literary text in order to fulfill both aesthetic and educational goals. By making the sujet's order deviate from that of thefabula, he forces on the reader a gap of information (the true nature of Hayyim-Michael's drinking party), which leads him to adopt erroneous expectations. The surprise, as well as the disappointment which the reader feels as the information gap is filled, sharpens and aggra- vates his awareness of Hayyim-Michael's crime. In this way, the reader's reaction to Hayyim-Michael's corruption is intensified. The intensity of the reader's reaction also stems from the fact that the delayed understanding creates in the reader the same emotions as IHayyim-Michael creates in his victims-both have been betrayed and misled.32 This compositional device, which efficiently uses the dynamic nature of the literary text, also serves the aesthetic stratum of the story; it contributes to the text's complexity, and requires a careful and sensitive process of reading. In addition, since Hayyim-Michael represents a social class in the Jewish community in Eastern Europe that insolently ruled its congregations, heartlessly and greedily exploiting them-this compositional device, which strengthens the reader's awareness of this kind of crime, also serves a major ideological purpose of the story: to condemn those sinister figures in Jewish society. The question of the aesthetic value of didacticism in literature is a well- known debate. On the one hand, such critics as Orwell, Wellek, Warren, and Ingarden do not see an inevitable contradiction between literature and didacticism: it is possible, they maintain, to weave didactic themes into the literary piece without spoiling its aesthetic values.33 On the other hand, there are critics who claim that a didactic message destroys the aesthetic texture of the piece, in the spirit of Mallarme's axiomatic statement that "poems are 31.

It seems that many Haskalah short stories prove, in this context, that a saying might be well wrought but still be wrong. The way in which the didactic message is rooted in those Haskalah stories provides many examples that didacticism and aesthetics are not necessarily point and counterpoint. And the role played by compositional poetics in all these examples is indeed undeniable. Evolution of the Poetics of Composition of the Haskalah Short Story: Some Inferential Comments Once acquainted with the compositional accomplishments of the Haskalah short story, especially in the light of the feebleness of the composi- tional poetics of the Haskalah novel, one cannot escape the question: why is it that the very same authors who produced remarkable compositional patterns in their short stories demonstrated great compositional weaknesses in their novels? The answer to this question is rooted in the different compositional natures of the novel and the short story. Undoubtedly, the compositional demands of writing a novel are much more complicated and challenging than those required to write a short story. The complexity of the novel's plot, the great number of scenes, developmental channels, among other elements which are an unavoidable part of the novel's composition, are much more demanding-from the writer's standpoint-than those which play a parallel role in the composition of the short story. Hence, the compo- sitional organization of the novel places aesthetic obstacles in the author's way that he avoids in composing a short story. A certain compositional device which can function in a short story as a major principle of organiza- tion, and can bestow upon the story adequate unity and coherence, may be no more than an isolated compositional phenomenon in a novel. Many of the authors of the realistic narrative of the Hebrew Enlighten- ment, who took their first hesitant steps in writing prose fiction, were rather gifted indeed. But a lack of experience, and a lack of literary heritage in prose fiction,34 placed a stumbling-block before them on their aesthetic way 34. For various historical reasons, which had social, cultural, and aesthetic consequences, there was a lapse in the creation of Hebrew literature-especially prose fiction-in Europe</page><page sequence="21">THE POETICS OF COMPOSITION OF THE HEBREW SHORT STORY 109 toward artistic accomplishment. They demonstrated considerable skill in the organization of short forms or sections of longer works, but when it came to sustaining the clusters of compositional patterns and devices which must be woven together in the coherent and complicated structure of a novel, they found it a challenge beyond their artistic abilities. Therefore, the very same author who skillfully shaped an impressive piece of compositional poetics in a short story, failed in constructing a novel. Smolenskin, for instance, who established a well-balanced composition in his short story "Nekam Berit" ("Covenant of Vengeance," 1905), failed badly in the composition of his long novel Ha-To'eh be-Darkhei ha-IHayyim ("The Wanderer in Life's Ways," 1876). In addition, the Hebrew Haskalah authors faced another disturbing obstacle as they began to compose novels, rooted in the conventions of writing and publication at that time. It was common for novels to be pub- lished serially.35 Consequently, the writing of the novel as well became serial in nature, which made the process of composing the novel difficult. Once an author is bound to the serial process, he is required to divide and spread out the plot's climaxes in order to give every chapter of the novel-to be published separately-an ending that will leave the reader in suspense and evoke his interest in reading the chapter to come. This writing technique makes the art of composing a novel complicated indeed, since it requires remarkable skill to establish a consistent, causally connected plot sequence under such conditions. Another compositional difficulty which is part of the serial technique of writing a novel is the fact that the author does not have the opportunity of viewing his completed piece as a coherent whole before its publication.36 Since the novelists of the Haskalah realistic period desired to convey didac- tic messages through their works, especially messages about the social circumstances of the Jews of Eastern Europe, they filled their novels with as many figures, situations, and channels of plot as possible. They sought to reflect an authentic social reality, in all its shades, in order to condemn its character and encourage change. Hence, the extremely detailed and over- loaded nature of their novels' fictional worlds added yet another difficulty. during the period from the end of the sixteenth century up to the very end of the eighteenth century. 35.

But when it came to the writing of short stories, most of these composi- tional obstacles were avoided; the relatively modest demands of organiza- tion evoked by a short story allowed the Hebrew Haskalah authors to leap over their technical limitations, and to display their literary talents. And so they did, and did it well indeed. University of Wisconsin Madison, Wis.</page></plain_text>
