<plain_text><page sequence="1">COFFEE, COFFEEHOUSES, AND THE NOCTURNAL RITUALS OF EARLY MODERN JEWRY by ELLIOTT HOROWITZ Although religious history has traditionally concerned itself with the transcendent dimension in human life, and social history with the mundane, the latter approach can also be used to illuminate the ways in which religion works itself out on the social plane. In fact, it might be argued that inquiries of this sort should occupy a prominent place on the agenda of any social and religious history of the Jews. Among historians of the Annales school, for whom the study of material life was long considered the backbone of his- torical inquiry, there has been a discernible move in recent years toward the study of religious life, especially in its popular forms. Whereas, for example, previous volumes in the valuable Johns Hopkins series of "Selections from the Annales" were devoted to such topics as food and drink in history, the one published in 1982 was entitled, significantly, Ritual, Religion and the Sacred. As that volume well illustrates, however, the historian need not choose between the social and the spiritual. Following an approach I have else- where called "the social history of piety,"' an attempt shall here be made to 1.

The suggestion is not thereby intended that religious develop- ments always have a social "explanation," but rather, that they always occur within particular social and material contexts (which is not to exclude the cultural) in which they may be embedded to a greater or lesser degree, and in which they consequently make more "sense" than in others. The question of the fit between a religious ritual and the particular set of circumstances in which it arose shall be addressed here, therefore, less from the point of view of etiology than from that of transportability-whether across cultural borders or geographical ones. Where coffee spread it extended the range of possibilities for making use of the night hours, whether for purposes pious or profane (and, as we will see, these were not mutually exclusive). Where it did not, the night remained considerably less malleable and less susceptible to human initiative. The attribution of a historical role to a beverage such as coffee is less startling than might appear at first glance and certainly less original. More than a quarter of a century ago (in an article that was later to be incorporat- ed in the collective volume Food and Drink in History) Jean Leclant observed that "both the history of ideas and the history of customs" could profit from an inquiry into the place of coffee and coffeehouses in seventeenth-century Paris. In doing so he followed a tradition in French scholarship stretching back, as he indicated, to Michelet and to Diderot's Encyclopddie.2 Although the history of Jewish customs, and perhaps even ideas, may also be linked to the place of coffee and coffeehouses in such cities as Safed or Venice, and although the beverage was much discussed in the responsa literature, the subject of coffee has suffered from conspicuous 2.

Ranum, eds., Food and Drink in History (Baltimore, 1979); pp. 86-97, (appeared origin- ally in Annales, E.S.C. 6 [1951]: 1-12). On the role of coffee in the emergence of the modern world, see H. E. Jacob, Coffee: Epic of a Commodity, trans. Eden Paul and Cedar Paul (New York, 1935), who claims that without it "modern civilization would be unthinkable" (p. 20). Jacob asserted somewhat poetically that "coffee has changed the surface of the globe. The muscular and cerebral stimulation and transformation produced in mankind by coffee have transfigured the visage of history" (pp. 23-24). Although his claim will not be fully endorsed in the present study, it serves as a useful contrast with those who have overlooked the role of cof- fee entirely.

Whereas the editors of the Jewish Encyclopedia saw fit, at the turn of the present century, to include an article on coffee in that work, their modern successors, who have brought us the new Encyclopaedia Judaica, evidently regarded the subject as unworthy of scholarly interest. Not only have they abandoned the notion of devoting a separate entry to the subject of coffee, but the only reference to coffee in the latter's index leads us to a certain Rabbi Coffee (first name not given) who earlier in the century served as spiritual leader of a Reform temple in Toledo, Ohio.3 In Islamic scholarship, by contrast, the subject has fared considerably better. An extensive entry under the heading of"Kahwa" appeared, in 1927, in the original Encyclopaedia ofl Islam, and some fifty years later the editors of the second edition saw fit to publish a revised and substantially expanded version.4 This, indeed, is quite appropriate, since it was evidently in fif- teenth-century Yemenite Sufi circles that the drinking of coffee originated, the beverage having been found useful for producing the necessary wakeful- ness for their nightly devotional exercises.5 By the middle of the sixteenth century coffee had spread to such urban centers as Mecca, Cairo, Istanbul, and Damascus, where its use was no longer confined to religious purposes, and where special establishments were devoted to its preparation and con- sumption. Before the century's end, as the late Fernand Braudel observed, coffee "had installed itself virtually throughout the Muslim world."6 3. Jewish Encyclopedia (1901-6), vol. 4, p. 142. Note the ironically prophetic observation in the Encyclopaedia Judaica (1972), vol. 6, col. 732 (hereafter cited as EJ), that many of the Jewish Encyclopedia's entries "have remained unsurpassed statements." The German Encyclopedia Judaica (1928-34), though never completed, nonetheless progressed far enough to have made clear its exclusion of an entry for "kaffee," and the same is true for the more popular Jtidisches Lexikon (1927-30). The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1939-43) did include a fairly exhaus- tive article on Rabbi Rudolph Coffee (vol. 3, pp. 232-233) but none on the more famous beverage of the same name. 4.

Israel Abrahams, almost a century ago, correctly noted "the early love" of Jews for coffee and its subsequent impact upon Jewish life, although he may have been somewhat off the mark in linking their en- thusiasm for the beverage to their sobriety and "their love of social inter- course with their fellows."7 Before him the considerable impact of the com- modity upon Jewish, and especially halakhic, literature had been noted by the Hungarian scholar Leopold Low, who as early as 1858 appended, in good "Wissenschaft" style, a lengthy footnote on coffee to an article devot- ed to quite another subject (the history of the Flesch family in Prague). Low outlined four major areas in which questions arose as a result of the intro- duction and spread on the beverage." His list, however, was not complete, and by its nature was evidently not intended to be. It neglected, for example, the question as to whether coffee prepared by gentiles was prohibited not only on the Sabbath but on the remaining days of the week as well, on the grounds of bishulei nokhrim.9 This was chronologically the first problem to arise in the responsa literature, and it continued to have important implica- tions for social relations between Jews and non-Jews during a period in which coffeehouses were emerging as the major hub of urban sociability, first in the East and then in the West.'? chaps. 2, 6, and the colorful description of the arrival and rapid popularization of coffee in mid-sixteenth-century Istanbul, quoted at length in Bernard Lewis, Istanbul and the Civiliza- tion of the Ottoman Empire (Norman, Okla., 1963), pp. 132-133. On the last point see also E. Birnbaum, "Vice Triumphant: The Spread of Coffee and Tobacco in Turkey," Durham Univer- sity Journal, December, 1956, pp. 21-27. 7. Israel Abrahams, Jewish Life in the Middle Ages (London, 1896), pp. 137-138. Abra- hams proudly made a point of noting that "coffee was introduced into England by Jews" (ibid.). On this see more recently David Katz, Philosemitism and the Readmission of the Jews to England (Oxford, 1982), p. 40 and the sources cited there, n. 154. Compare, in a similar vein to Abrahams, the remarks of Attilio Milano, Storia degli ebrei in Italia (Turin, 1963), p. 567. 8. These were the permissibility of drinking it before morning prayers; whether coffee, when taken at the end of a meal, required a separate blessing; whether, after drinking coffee (outside of a meal) a final blessing (berakha aharona) was necessary, or whether, on account of its being sipped in small quantities no such blessing was necessary; and finally, whether coffee might be drunk on the Sabbath in non-Jewish coffeehouses. See Leopold L6w, Gesammelte Schriften, ed. Immanuel L6w (Szegedin, 1890), 2:225-227. It was perhaps through Low that Abrahams, who cites him frequently, was alerted to the topic. 9. On this prohibition see Moses Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Maakhalot Asurot 17:14-21; Joseph Karo, Shulhan 'Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 113-114. 10. On the rise of the coffeehouses in the Near East, their social life and social norms, see</page><page sequence="5">COFFEE, COFFEEHOUSES, AND NOCTURNAL RITUALS 21 Furthermore, only one of the four areas in which Low noted the impact of coffee related to the drink's special qualities as a stimulant-its capability of driving away sleep and creating, on short notice, a refreshing sense of wakefulness. It was precisely these qualities which popularized the drinking of coffee among the Sufis of Yemen and Cairo, among whom it became an essential, and in some cases ceremonial, aspect of their nocturnal devo- tions." In the case of Jewish society it would be, therefore, equally appro- priate to inquire into the role of coffee in generating or popularizing new forms of night life, whether pious or profane. Was it incorporated, for example, into the nocturnal rituals popularized by the kabbalists, and did its subsequent spread affect the degree of receptivity accorded those rituals as they, together with coffee, crossed the Mediterranean? This line of inquiry owes much, of course, to the work of the late Fernand Braudel, whose wise words may serve us as both a warning and an invitation: "There is a danger that the history of coffee may lead us astray. The anecdotal, the picturesque, and the unreliable play an enormous part in it."'2 When and where, then, does coffee make its first appearance in Jewish history? The earliest responsum in which it is discussed concerns the ques- tion of its permissibility for consumption when prepared by non-Jews and was composed by R. David ibn Abi Zimra (d. 1573). This is hardly surpris- ing, for the forty years in which Radbaz resided in Egypt (1513-1553) co- incided with the period in which coffee drinking spread from Sufi circles to the Egyptian population at large.'3 He saw no problem with the beverage Hattox, Coffee and Coffeehouses, chaps. 6-8. On those of Europe see, among the many treat- ments, William H. Ukers, All About Coffee (New York, 1922), pp. 27-28; Leclant, "Coffee and Caf6s"; Antonio Pilot, La bottega da caffe (Venice, 1916). 11. See above, no. 5. Note the contemporary account quoted by Hattox, Coffee and Coffee- houses, p. 14: "At the beginning of this [the sixteenth] century, the news reached us in Egypt that a drink, called qahwa, had spread in the Yemen and was being used by Sufi shaykhs and others to help them stay awake during their devotional exercises." On the ceremonial character of its use, see also ibid., p. 28 and Ukers, All About Coffee, p. 17. 12. Braudel, Structures of Everyday Life, p. 256. 13. Shortly before 1553 Radbaz returned to Palestine, where he spent his final two decades. It would seem more likely, however, that the responsum was penned in Egypt, over whose Jews his spiritual hegemony lasted some four decades. See Israel Goldman, The Life and Times of Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra (New York, 1970), chap. 1, esp. pp. 5, 13, and H. J. Zimmels, "David b. Solomon ibn Abi Zimra,' EJ 5:1356-58.

Coffeehouses, however, were for him another matter entirely, prompting him to add: Nonetheless, I do not consent to its being drunk at a meeting place [mesibbah] of non-Jews, for this has some undesirable consequences and the Jews are holy.... And, especially since that beverage has no [pleasing] taste nor odor nor appearance, if it is needed for medicinal purposes one may send for it and have it delivered home. This is done by their leading figures, who would be embarrassed to drink it at such establishments.'4 In distinguishing between the beverage and its characteristic place of consumption, Radbaz expressed an opinion strikingly similar to that of his fellow Cairene, the Islamic jurist al-Jaziri. The latter composed a lengthy treatise on the subject of coffee in the wake of the sometimes violent clashes which had occurred in Cairo after its introduction there in the early six- teenth century."5 In it he praised coffee on account of the many benefits it provided, especially that of driving away sleep during the performance of noctural devotions. On the other hand, however, he carefully limited his advocacy of the beverage by insisting that its use be kept free of the taint of the reprehensible activities then associated with the coffeehouses.'6 Like his Muslim colleague, Radbaz demonstrates considerable awareness of the social realities of coffee drinking and of the problematic status of the places in which it was engaged in publicly. 14. David b. Solomon ibn Abi Zimra, Responsa (Warsaw, 1882), 3:637. This responsum was discussed by Goldman, Life and Times, as part of his treatment of "medicine and health practices" in the responsa of Radbaz, but the author unfortunately did not realize that the "medicine" referred to was coffee!

Yet some differences of opinion emerged concerning its consumption when prepared by non-Jews. R. Hayyim Benveniste of Smyrna, who died a century after Radbaz, report- ed in response to a query on this subject that drinking the coffee of non-Jews was customary "in all the places of which we have heard," but he himself had recently decided to abstain from it. He claimed, moreover, to have found support for such a position in the literature describing the customs of the "divine kabbalist" R. Isaac Luria-the ARI.'8 Luria, a younger contemporary of Radbaz, had, like the latter, migrated from Egypt to Palestine during the second half of the sixteenth century, set- tling in Safed. There, as is well known, he gathered around him a circle of disciples who followed his kabbalistic system and observed his distinctive practices, both of which they continued to disseminate after his death in 1572. One of the practices popularized by the ARI and his disciples was the regular recitation of a midnight rite mourning the Temple's destruction and praying for its return. This practice, known as Tikkun Hazot, had been 17. R. Hezekiah de Silva, Peri Hadash to Shulhan 'Arukh, Orah Hayyim 89:3 (for another example of his taking coffee's properties as a stimulant into consideration, see ibid. to Orah Hayyim 481) Although de Silva lived in Jerusalem, one may note the corroborating testi- mony of his contemporary R. Abraham b. Mordecai ha-Levi of Cairo that it was "an everyday practice at sizable meals" that after drinking a glass of wine at the conclusion of the grace "another beverage called coffee" would be brought in order to restore one's presence of mind. Responsa Ginat Veradim (Constantinople, 1716), Orah Hayyim 1. Ha-Levi and the Jerusalem rabbi Abraham b. David Yizhaki engaged in an extended dispute on the question of whether a "final blessing" need be recited after a cup of coffee or whether, on account of its being sipped slowly while hot, the beverage was exempt. See above n. 8 and the latter's responsa published under the title Zer'a Avraham, pt. 1 (Smyrna, 1732), Orah Hayyim 2-5. In no. 3 reference is made to the custom of discussing the quality of the coffee ("ha-tova hi im ra'ah") while drinking it, which served as a social impediment to downing the cup swiftly. For other customs followed in the drinking of coffee, such as passing the cup, see Hattox, Coffee and Coffeehouses, chap. 8. On conversation obligatorily accompanying the drinking of coffee, see also Leclant, "Coffee and Caf6s," p. 91. 18. See Hayyim b. Israel Beneviste, Ba'ei Hayyei, pt. 3 (Salonika, 1788), no. 155. Among his considerations was his sense that "coffee is important enough among those who drink it for one to extend an invitation for a single cup." For other attributions to the ARI of the opinion that coffee prepared by non-Jews was prohibited, see Immanuel Hai Ricchi, Mishnat Hasidim (Amsterdam, 1727), "motzaei shabbat" 7:7, and Isaac Lampronti, Pahad Yizhak, vol. 7 (Lyck, 1874), fol. 61a, s.v.

As Schechter noted, "midnight, with its awe-inspiring silence and the feeling of utter isolation which comes upon man," was a favorite time for voluntary prayer. Only in late-sixteenth-century Palestine did Tikkun Hazot suddenly take off and become a mass rite, spreading from there to other countries in the Near East and the Mediterranean basin.'9 Its popular- ization was, of course, part of the wider diffusion of kabbalistic rites during this period and their penetration into daily life, but it can hardly be divorced from the increasing availability, by day and night, of a stimulant such as coffee. Although increasingly available, the beverage was not as universally familiar in the Near East of the sixteenth century as we might expect. R. Joseph Caro, for example, who came to Safed from Turkey in 1536 and completed his Bet Yosefthere some six years later, shows no signs in the rele- vant sections of that work (nor of his later Shulkhan 'A rukh) of any familiar- ity with coffee.20 Yet Caro would have had good reason to be interested in a stimulant which could effectively promote wakefulness. For he, together with his brother-in-law R. Solomon Alkabetz, introduced the custom of observing an all-night study vigil on the festival of Shavuot, and he also invested much energy in remaining awake at night on a year-round basis in order to commune with his personal "Maggid."2' By 1580, however, there was at least one coffeehouse in Safed, for it is mentioned in the responsa of R. Moses Trani, Caro's successor as spiritual 19. See Gershom Scholem, s.v. "Luria, Isaac," EJ 11:571-578, and, on the shift in Tikkun Hazot in Luria's circle, idem, "Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists," in On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, trans. Ralph Manheim (New York, 1965), pp. 146-150. For the quotation from Solomon Schechter, see his essay "Saints and Saintliness" in Studies in Judaism, second series (Philadelphia, 1908), pp. 155-156. Concerning the prehistory of the rite, note also the comments of Isaiah Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 1961), p. 662. A comprehensive study of Jewish night prayer during the Middle Ages remains a desideratum. 20. See, for example, Bet Yosef and Shulhan 'Arukh, Orah Hayyim 89; Yoreh De'ah 113-114. 21.

On Caro's "Maggid," on his need to remain awake at night in study in order to merit maggidic visitations, and on his difficulties in doing so, see ibid. chap. 12. It is possible that Caro's Balkan background made him less aware of the beverage and its properties than his colleagues who hailed from Egypt, to which coffee came earlier and where its absorption into daily life was rapid.

Furthermore, among the fundamental changes resulting from the introduc- tion of coffee and coffeehouses in the cities of the Islamic eastern Mediter- ranean during the sixteenth century was the gradual breakdown of some of the conventional divisions between day and night. The latter, it has been noted, became associated to an increasing degree with activity rather than repose, and with sociability outside the home.23 Did not this shift, together with the easy availability of a new stimulant, present the ideal conditions for the revival of a "half-forgotten observance," to use Scholem's phrase, which required noctural wakefulness and which, under Zoharic influence, focused upon the hour of midnight, an hour which had otherwise lost almost all sig- nificance in positive Judaism?24 It has been suggested, as a corrective to Scholem's version of the Luri- 22.

This responsum was cited by Jacob Kena'ani, "Economic Life in Safed and Its Environs in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries" (Hebrew), Zion, o.s. 6 (1934): 186, who also noted its testimony that the coffeehouse in question was open late at night.

In the early eighteenth century Richard Pococke was to report of his visit to Safed, "I was recommended to the cadi, who received me with great civilty and entertained us with coffee." See his A Description of the East (London, 1743-45) vol. 2, p. 76. 23. See Hattox, Coffee and Coffeehouses, pp. 127-128. He writes furthermore that "in earlier times, there were few and particular reasons for a person to be out at night . . . The coffeehouse did much to change this. Men went out at night to drink, meet with others, exchange information, ideas, or pleasantries, and otherwise amuse themselves." Some of these amusements would seem to have been behind the later decision of the Jewish community of Jerusalem to prohibit bachelors from going out to Tikkun Hazot at night. See Ya'akov Barnai, "The Regulations (Taqanot) of Jerusalem in the Eighteenth Century" (Hebrew), in Amnon Cohen, ed., Jerusalem in the Early Ottoman Period (Jerusalem, 1979), p. 308 and the sources cited there. 24.

Although the Zohar's fascination with midnight was presumably known to the mystics in both cities, coffee had not yet affected Jerusalem in the early sixteenth century in the way that it would affect Safed before the century's end.26 From the perspective of their social history, the differences between the rites practiced in the two cities signify more than do the simi- larities. In the Safed rite popularized in the circle of the ARI and his disciples, the custom was encouraged not only of rising at midnight for prayer (the mournful Tikkun Rahel followed by the messianically charged Tikkun Leah) but of remaining awake and engaging in Torah study for the remainder of the night.27 For those who could not adhere to such a grueling schedule, however, the alternative suggested was to rise at midnight and study briefly after the recitation of prayers, then return to sleep, to rise again half an hour 25. This view was expressed by Ira Robinson, "Messianic Prayer Vigils in Jerusalem in the Early Sixteenth Century," Jewish Quarterly Review 52 (1981): 38-42. After I wrote this article, Moshe Idel's article, "On Mishmarot and Messianism in Jerusalem in the 16th-17th Cen- turies" (Hebrew), Shalem 5 (1987), came to my attention. Idel, too, stresses, contra Robinson (pp. 88-89), that the vigils instituted by R. Abraham in Jerusalem were considerably different from the Tikkun Hazot later practiced in Safed. 26. Unfortunately, Hattox's otherwise quite comprehensive work fails to deal with the cities of Palestine, but it would appear that coffee came to Jerusalem, or at least to its Jews, con- siderably later than it did to Safed. As late as 1616 an emissary from Jerusalem in Iraq seems to have been unable to identify the drink when a cup was poured for him. See Yom Tov Zahalon, New Responsa (Jerusalem, 1980), no. 3, previously published by Meir Benayahu in Kobez 'al Yad 15 (1950): 164-166. Zahalon, who lived primarily in Safed during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, discussed elsewhere the question as to whether coffee prepared by non-Jews was permissible. See his Responsa (Venice, 1694), 1:60. 27. See Scholem, "Tradition and New Creation," pp. 149-150. Note there the quotation that "the time from midnight to morning is a time of grace, and a ray of this grace falls upon him even in the daytime." See also Fine, Safed Spirituality, pp. 17-18. The kabbalist R. Meir Poppers, in a work written in Jerusalem in 1643, asserted that rising at midnight "is extremely beneficial for acquiring ruah ha-kodesh." See his Or Zaddikim (Hamburg, 1690), p. 2.

Abraham ha-Levi Berukhim (d. 1593) who every night would rise at midnight and walk through all the streets, raising his voice and shouting bitterly, "Arise in honor of the Lord .. for the Shekhinah is in exile and our Temple has been burnt." . . . And he would call each scholar by his name, not departing until he saw that he had left his bed. Within an hour the city was full of the sounds of study-Mishnah and Zohar and mid- rashim of the Rabbis and Psalms and Prophets, as well as hymns, dirges, and supplicatory prayers.29 A central element in Safed spirituality then, especially in its Lurianic variety, was the considerable stress it placed upon nocturnal forms of piety. It would, of course, be unfairly reductionist to claim that this shift was pos- sible only with the aid of the newly available stimulant served in the coffee- house. The history of religion knows countless instances in which human beings, when present in spiritually charged environments (of which Safed is a classic example), have been able to transcend the normal limits of their physical constitutions. Yet what of the later survival and wider influence of their practices among others? The introduction of coffee brought with it, beyond the mere availability of a new stimulant, the emergence of a new per- ception of the night in which the hours of darkness could be shaped and manipulated by human initiative rather than condemn man to passive repose. Tikkun Hazot, it is maintained, was embedded in such a "coffee culture" whether or not it could have arisen without benefit of stimulants. The extent of its embeddedness is most clearly apparent when we examine the survival of the nocturnal forms of piety first cultivated in Safed and the history of their reception elsewhere.

When the Italian rabbi Moses Zacuto responded, in 1673, to a query from Mantua regarding the permissibility of drinking before the recitation of morning prayers, he expressed the opinion that only such beverages as beer or wine were prohi- bited but that water or medicinal drinks were not. As evidence he cited the practice "throughout all the land of Israel and the kingdom of the Turks, where it is customary to drink coffee every [night] after midnight, for it is similar to medicine in that it drives away sleep, as is known."30 Zacuto's main point in the responsum, as Tishby has noted, was not the permissibility of coffee, which was still relatively unknown in Italy and concerning which his Mantuan questioner did not explicitly inquire.31 Rather, he used the cof- fee consumed in the East as an illustrative example of the sort of medicinal beverage that was permitted before prayers. One assumes that its consump- tion "after midnight" was popular both among those who rose at midnight to perform the abbreviated rite and among their more pious counterparts who remained awake in prayer and study from midnight to dawn. Although R. Moses Zacuto came to Italy by way of Amsterdam and had never been to the East,32 his close familiarity with Jewish noctural habits in 30. Moses Zacuto, Responsa (Venice, 1761), no. 59.

Elia Levi de Veali" (Hebrew), Sinai 71 (1972): 182. 31. Coffee was introduced into Venice in 1615, but in 1683 there was still only one cafe in the city (see below). Just two years before Zacuto penned his responsum, Fausto Nairone's Dis- corso della Salutifera Bevanda Cahve 6 vero Cafe (Rome, 1671) appeared in Italian translation from the original Latin (in which it had been published in a learned journal some three years earlier; see Dufour, Traitez, p. 35). In this work Nairone described coffee as one of the miracles of nature, stating that it had been discovered by an Arabian shepherd and enthusiastically embraced by (Christian) monks who found it useful for the performance of their nocturnal orations. Its subsequent spread, he believed, had been aided by divine providence (pp. 21-23). Nairone also quoted such travelers as Pietro della Valle on the merits of coffee, and testified that during his own travels in the East during 1650 he had sampled coffee and found it benefi- cial primarily "per la corroboratione dello stomaco e per la vigilanza della notte" (ibid., p. 53). Writing from Turkey earlier in the century the English traveler George Sandys had commented similarly on the popular drink "black as soote, and tasting not much unlike it. . . which helpeth, as they say, digestion, and procureth alacritie." See Sandys Travels (London, 1673) p. 51, quoted also in Samuel Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumous; or, Purchas His Pilgrimes, vol. 8 (Glasgow, 1905), p. 146. On della Valle see below, n. 49. 32.

Although</page><page sequence="13">COFFEE, COFFEEHOUSES, AND NOCTURNAL RITUALS 29 "the land of Israel and the kingdom of the Turks" is hardly surprising. For, as he testified in a letter published by Scholem some forty years ago, he had performed the midnight Tikkun "innumerable times" with the Safed emis- sary in Italy, R. Benjamin ha-Levi.33 Zacuto presumably heard from the latter about the manner in which Jews of the East prepared themselves for the performance of the midnight rite. He may even have witnessed R. Ben- jamin drinking what was then in Italy still an exotic beverage on some of the long nights they spent together. Zacuto's testimony concerning the role of coffee in midnight vigils as practiced in the land of Israel is corroborated by a first-hand observer. R. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who arrived there as a member of R. Judah Hasid's entourage early in the eighteenth century.34 His account of their stay includes a description of the annual vigil observed at the grave of the prophet Samuel on the 28th of Iyyar. After the afternoon and evening prayers, he reports, those present would read from the Book of Samuel and other texts in which the prophet was mentioned. And at midnight all the lights in the cave were extinguished, and they sat in the darkness reciting Tikkun Hazot in a lachrymose voice. After they completed the Tikkun they studied some Zohar, and then the drink called coffee was brought, quite hot, and given to each person .... Afterwards songs and hymns are recited . . . and there is celebration until the morning. At first light the morning prayers are recited and all return home in peace.35 R. Gedaliah's testimony points not only to the use of coffee in nocturnal rituals, but to the existence of an almost formalized coffee break, dividing according to the tradition cited there Zacuto had once fasted for forty days in order to forget the Latin he had acquired in his youth, the Italian edition of Nairone's work would have been accessible to him. There is, of course, no proof that he actually read it. 33. Gershom Scholem, "Regarding the Attitude of Jewish Rabbis to Sabbatianism," (Hebrew), Zion 13-14 (1948-49): 62. On R.

What, however, of the spread of Tikkun Hazot beyond the confines of the land of Israel and the Ottoman Empire? This question is part of a much larger one concerning the manner and extent to which Lurianic Kabbalah, in the words of Scholem, "changed the face of Judaism in all its aspects, theoretical as well as practical."37 Here we shall concern ourselves primarily with Italy as a case study and with the manner in which coffee and Tikkun Hazot, two Middle Eastern "products" which began moving westward across the Mediterranean between the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, came to attain considerable popularity among its Jews. Although various factors, social as well as spiritual, contributed to the eventual popu- larization of the midnight rite in that country, it shall be argued here that the changes brought about by the introduction of coffee and coffeehouses were particularly instrumental. These changes prove especially useful in helping to explain the otherwise puzzling delay in the popular reaction to Tikkun Hazot. Although it was at first virtually ignored in Italy in favor of the home-grown rite of Shomrim la-Boker, it was able eventually to overtake and then supplant the latter. Coffee, it shall be maintained, played a central role in opening the night to ritual activity. Beginning in the 1570s a new form of Jewish piety made its presence felt in Italy, beginning in Venice and spreading to some of the neighboring com- munities in the region. Societies calling themselves by such names as Shom- rim la-Boker and Me'irei Shahar were founded for the purpose of perform- 36. These would seem to correspond to the Tikkun Rahel and Tikkun Leah respectively. On the similarly ceremonial use of coffee in Sufi nocturnal devotions, see the sources cited above, nn. 5, 11. 37. The quotation is from Scholem, "Tradition and New Creation," p. 135, where a social history of Kabbalah is implicitly called for.

We have it on the authority of R. Aaron Berechia of Modena that the initiator of this rite in Italy was none other than his teacher, the kabbalist R. Menahem Azariah of Fano, whose familiarity with the writings emanating from Safed is well known.39 More- over, R. Aaron Berechia himself, in the handbook he prepared for use by his own Modenese Me'irei Shahar confraternity, testifies that the Palestinian emissaries Israel Sarug and Gedaliah Cordovero had been in the habit of rising, during their stay in Italy, to perform midnight devotions-the former in the author's own home.40 Yet in the same work he presents two alterna- tive liturgies, the preferred one to be recited not, as we might expect, at mid- night but rather, shortly before dawn, and the second, for those unable to rise early, to be recited before bed.41 Midnight, however, had nonetheless been on the minds of some of his 38.

On the latter, see Gershom Scholem, "Was Israel Sarug a Disciple of Luria?" (Hebrew), Zion 5 (1939-40): 214-243. On Cordovero, see Abraham David, s.v. "Cordovero, Gedaliah," EJ 5:967, and the bibliography cited there. The somewhat mis- leading assertion, however, is made there that in Modena both Sarug and Cordovero "urged the adoption of the Safed customs of rising early to mourn for the destruction of the Temple and to pray for the redemption." Compare also Abraham Ya'ari, Sheluhei Erez Yisrael (Jerusa- lem, 1977), p. 151. 41. Neither one adheres, furthermore, to the custom which, according to R. Aaron Berachia, was followed by his grandfather R. Hillel Modena of Viadana, who would remain awake each night until after midnight, and then recite verses from Daniel and the Book of Psalms while sitting on the ground (Ashmoret ha-Boker, fol. 248b). This, too, was evidently excessively demanding for the wider public.</page><page sequence="16">32 ELLIOTT HOROWITZ Italian Jewish contemporaries. During the early summer of 1586 one of them, R. Jacob Alperon of Lodi, queried some rabbinical colleagues con- cerning the merits attached to midnight by the rabbis and especially the kab- balists. According to the latter, he understood, it was desirable to rise for prayer at midnight, the hour when God amused himself with the righteous in the garden of Eden, "or at least before the last third of the night." Yet, asked R. Jacob, "now that the short nights are beginning, to be followed by the longer ones [of winter], how shall we determine the hour of midnight or the third watch, for . . . when it is midnight for us, in other places a third of the night will not yet have passed, and vice versa. . . . Or perhaps the rabbis and kabbalists had in mind the time of midnight in the land of Israel."42 R. Jacob, it would appear, had heard of the custom then practiced in the land of Israel but was looking for an acceptable excuse to avoid implementing it in northern Italy, especially during the short summer nights, In neighboring Mantua Abraham Portaleone, writing at the beginning of the seventeenth century, noted the considerable merit attached by the Zohar to Torah study at midnight. Rather than encouraging the adoption of this practice by his readers, however, he was content to suggest that study during the first watch of the night had largely the same value.43 Both Italian authors flirted with the idea of midnight but shied away from even suggesting that prayer or study be regularly pursued at that inconvenient hour. During the period in which they were writing, the predawn rite of Shom- rim la-Boker was flourishing in Italy. Between the end of the sixteenth century and the late 1620s no less than seven separate editions of liturgies 42. Jacob Alperon, Responsa Nahalat Ya'akov (Padua, 1622), pp. 6 ff.

Abraham Portaleone, Shiltei ha-Giborim (Mantua, 1612), fol. 132b. The author, who was a prominent physician, may have been professionally prejudiced against nocturnal study. The physician Amatus Lusitanus, upon treating another Mantuan Jew, Azariah dei Rossi, in the mid-sixteenth century, wrote concerning the latter's symptoms: "Here we must refer to study at night, which is harmful and contrary to nature and is therefore to be avoided; at night the spirits withdraw into the interior, and the effort and excitement of study forces them out." See Harry Friedenwald, The Jews and Medicine (Baltimore, 1944), vol. 2, p. 400. Contrast these remarks, however, with those of another physician-Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah 3:13. The social and intellectual history of nocturnal study among the Jews, like the his- tory of nocturnal prayer, requires a separate monograph.</page><page sequence="17">COFFEE, COFFEEHOUSES, AND NOCTURNAL RITUALS 33 for predawn prayer had been published there.44 Societies for the recitation of these prayers existed by the latter date in all the major Italian communi- ties, with some, like Mantua and Modena, hosting two, and Venice, where it all began, as many as three.45 Yet during the same period not a single edition of Tikkun Hazot appeared in Italy. Only in Mantua, at the end of the 1620s, do we first hear of a Hevrat Hazot Laila in Italy, which, however, was founded later than the two local confraternities for predawn prayer, and, unlike them, did not publish its own liturgy.46 This resistance to nocturnal rituals in Italy is especially striking in light of the popularity of those involving rising before dawn and in light, further- more, of the considerable propaganda then taking place in that country on behalf of the Safed form of spirituality. Geographical factors, it is true, must be taken into consideration. Venice, for example, at upwards of 45 degrees of latitude, is considerably farther north than Safed, at only 33 degrees. Hence its summer nights could be shorter by as much as two hours, leaving precious little sleep on either side of midnight for those who chose to rise at that hour.47 Kabbalistic authorities, however, in both Safed and Italy had been willing to make concessions on this matter during the difficult summer months, so it is unlikely that geography alone can account for the differ- 44.

Abraham Berachia's comments on developments in other communities are also quoted.

Simonsohn (Mantua, p. 557) points to its existence in 1637, but from the testimony of R. Aaron Berachia of Modena we know of its existence a decade earlier. See Tishby, "The Con- frontation," p. 41. A Seder Hazot was then available in the Seder ve-Tikkun Keriat Shema, published in Prague in 1615 (Steinschneider, CB, no. 3082), but it is unlikely that this work was used by the Mantuan confraternity. Their failure to publish a prayerbook of their own, which would have been the first of its sort in Italy, testifies to their own recognition of the custom's lack of popularity in that country. 47.

What did change, then? Here we return to the matter of coffee. This beverage, of which Italians only began to learn in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries49 (when the Jews among them were first hearing of Tikkun Hazot), was by then at home throughout the Islamic eastern Medi- terranean. From there it was first brought to Venice in 1615, where the first coffeehouse, evidently the first in all of Europe, was opened twenty-five years later."5 The period in which the predawn rite of Shomrim la-Boker emerged in Italy and spread rapidly among its Jewish communities was thus one in which coffee was at first unavailable in that country and then exoti- cally rare. Although Pietro della Valle had reported from Constantinople that "when drunk after supper it prevents those who consume it from feeling sleepy," few then in Italy were in a position to change their nocturnal habits with the aid of coffee. From the middle of the seventeenth century, however, side by side with Shomrim la-Boker, the nocturnal rite of Tikkun Hazot becomes an increas- ingly visible presence upon the Italian scene. Giulio Morosini, the former Samuel Nahmias who was baptized in 1649, provided in his Via della fede an insider's description of the two "shifts" of Venetian Jews who would come to the synagogue before the regular morning services. The members of the first, whom he calls "the most devoted," arrive "one or two hours before 48. See Zacuto, Iggerot ha-RMZ, no. 11, where the opinion of R. Hayyim Vital is also cited. Abraham Rovigo, who had queried Zacuto on this matter, was evidently unhappy with his master's ruling that in the summer the Tikkun could be recited shortly before or after dawn, but never before midnight. He was emboldened to inquire what the saintly ARI did in the sum- mer on the nights of his wife's ritual ablutions, after which he would wait until midnight before performing intercourse (see above, n. 24). R. Moses responded curtly that the ARI would cer- tainly have risen before dawn even then, "but there is no need to inform us of this, since it is obvious." See ibid., no. 12. On special summer hours for Tikkun Hazot see also Isaiah Bassan, Lahmei Todah (Venice, 1741) fol. 88d. 49. On the reports of Prospero Alpini and Pietro della Valle, see Jacob, Coffee: Epic ofa Commodity, p. 44, and Braudel, Structures of Everyday Life, p. 256. The latter had written from Constantinople in 1615 concerning coffee that "when drunk after supper, it prevents those who consume it from feeling sleepy. For that reason students who wish to read into the late hours of the night are fond of it." See also above, n. 31. 50.

The members of the second, whom he calls "the less devoted" and belong to the Hevrah (sic) Shomrim la-Boker rise only shortly before dawn and go to the synagogue, where "they wait until the lamenta- tions of those of the first class are completed, and then, in a rather livelier (or at least less mournful) voice, they recite several penitential prayers ... and confessions.'' Although the former group is not identified as a confra- ternity, its members would undoubtedly have described the rite they per- formed as Tikkun Hazot. In 1655 a liturgy for the "midnight" ritual was published in Italy for the first time, in R. Nathan Shapira's Tuv Ha-A retz.52 In that same year a Hazot confraternity was founded in Verona (more than four decades after the foundation there of a Hevrat Shomrim la-Boker) and another was operating in Ferrara.53 The rather delayed emergence of Tikkun Hazot in Italy, then, occurred only after the arrival there, also by way of the Mediterranean, of coffee. It was not, moreover, the only nocturnal rite to experience such a fate. Ferrara's Hazot confraternity saw fit, in 1655, to publish a book of readings 51.

Earlier in that work, however, Roth noted that Morosini's Via is "extraordinarily replete with information for the reconstruction of the social history of the Ghetto" in the author's day (ibid., p. 118).

The custom of remaining awake in study on the former night had been introduced by R. Joseph Caro and R. Solomon Alkabetz in the early 1530s, and spread, by the century's end, among the adherents of kabbalistic piety in Safed and elsewhere in the land of Israel. In the list of customs prepared by R. Abraham Galante it is reported that on the night of Shavuot, "following the meal, every congregation assembles in its own syna- gogue and those present do not sleep the whole night long," reading selec- tions from biblical, rabbinic, and mystical literature "until the break of dawn."'54 "Throughout the night of Hoshana Rabbah," it is reported in the same source, "they recite psalms and penitential prayers." Early in the seventeenth century R. Isaiah Horowitz reported that Hoshana Rabbah, like Shavuot, was observed in the land of Israel with all-night Torah study.55 In some of the Palestinian sources the very fact of sleeplessness on these nights was stressed over and beyond the importance of study. Both vigils, moreover, fell on days on which (unlike the Sabbath) coffee could be pre- pared by a Jew. It may thus be presumed that significant numbers of those who observed them fortified themselves with the stimulant which the hidden hand of God had recently brought to their region. It is therefore quite telling that despite the many avenues of communica- tion between the Jews of Italy and those of Palestine, these two holiday vigils 54.

When they did appear, moreover, they took a predictably different shape. In 1648 a Hoshana Rabbah liturgy was published in Mantua intended for reci- tation not during a night-long vigil but rather "before dawn on the great day, the day of the willow." Its author, Hananiah Eliakim Rieti, had been associated with the local Shomrim la-Boker confraternity, whose rite repre- sented a similar Italian compromise with the rigors of Safed kabbalism.56 In the same year a book of readings intended for use on the nights of Shavuot and Hoshana Rabbah was published in Venice, but its contents differed considerably from the rites then favored in the land of Israel. Its title page, furthermore, mentioned the custom of studying Torah on these nights, but spoke only of doing with "little sleep."'57 It was evidently as a corrective to these editions and to Italian practice on these two nights that R. Nathan Shapira included in his Tuv Ha-Aretz (Venice, 1655) the Palestinian version of the rites for the two vigils, stressing, with regard to Shavuot, that anyone who avoided sleep would be assured of surviving the year. As part of his campaign to reorient Italian Jewry toward closer adherence to the rites favored in Palestine, R. Nathan also included in the same work the "authen- tic" version of Tikkun Hazot-its first appearance in print.58 Yet despite such efforts, Italian Jewry of the mid-seventeenth century responded with considerably less enthusiasm to the latter rite than it had to 56.

This, too, reflects the initial lack of receptiveness in Italy for a special rite for Hoshana Rabbah. The day eventually became a kind of festival for the Shomrim la-Boker societies in that country.

The few Hazot societies which emerged were generally short-lived, competing unsuccessfully with the preexisting societies for predawn prayer,59 and leaving behind little docu- mentation. In no case, unlike Shomrim la-Boker, was the rite popular enough for there to be two competing confraternities in a single community, nor did any Italian confraternity publish its own Tikkun Hazot handbook during the course of the seventeenth century. During the same period in which Tikkun Hazot was playing second fid- dle to Shomrim la-Boker in the Italian communities, coffee was just becom- ing available in that country but not yet widely popular. Venice, where the first coffeehouse was established in 1640, still had only one in 1683.60 Jewish sources, too, attest to the relative foreignness of the product even in the latter half of the seventeenth century. R. Moses Zacuto, in his 1673 respon- sum discussed above, refers to the drinking of coffee as primarily an Oriental custom. At about the same time R. Shabbetai Ber, writing in Italy, dealt with the question as to whether "the coffee, which is imbibed especially in Eastern countries," was prohibited when prepared by non-Jews.6' During the same years some of the most devoted kabbalists in Italy pressed hard for permission to recite Tikkun Hazot before midnight, making it clear that remaining awake beyond that hour posed enormous difficulties.62 The cooler reception given the rite in the Italian communities than in those of the eastern Mediterranean would seem, therefore, to have stemmed in no small degree from the fact that in Italy, as in all of Europe, the night had not yet been conquered with the aid of coffee. 59. On the sense of competitiveness with Shomrim la-Boker on the part of the adherents of Tikkun Hazot, note the introduction of R. Nathan Nata Hannover to Sha'arei Ziyyon (Prague, 1662). The author had spent time in Italy in the 1650s and had been closely associated with the Palestinian emissaries Nathan Shapira and Benjamin ha-Levi, whose views he would seem to echo.

The Venetian ghetto, according to a survey con- ducted in 1713, contained at least two coffeehouses, one of which conven- iently occupied the first storefront on the right as one entered from the Canareggio.65 Jews in Mantua became increasingly active in the coffee business, and by the middle of the century there was at least one Jewish cof- feehouse operating there.66 In the ghetto of Verona there were no less than two, and they clearly had an impact upon its social life. Their ambiance was such that the authorities saw fit to issue three separate orders between 1745 and 1755, prohibiting the Jews from introducing "women of any religion" into their coffeehouses, whether by day or night.67 Coffee also figures prominently in the sumptuary laws passed by the Italian Jewish communities during the course of the eighteenth century. In some cases it is treated as a luxury item, but in others its consumption is strategically controlled as a means of controlling nocturnal behavior.

Others were permitted to attend the veglia, but only these were given the wherewithal to get through the night. Similar steps were taken later in the century in Ancona and Mantua. The link between coffee and nocturnal wakefulness had thus achieved official recognition.68 How did these developments affect the fortunes of Tikkun Hazot? We would perhaps be inclined to believe that the incipient modernity of eighteenth-century Jewish culture, at least in the West, would contribute to the decline of a custom so arcane and inconvenient.69 The Italian evidence, however, points in the opposite direction. Rather than fading away, Tikkun Hazot gathered strength in the eighteenth century and achieved what would appear to be unprecedented popularity. In the seven decades between 1704 and 1774 no less than eight editions of Tikkun Hazot were published in Italy, more than twice the total for the entire seventeenth century.70 In 1746 alone two separate editions appeared in Mantua, one of which was published for Hevrat Hazot of Verona, a confraternity whose fortunes perhaps best reflect the changing status of Tikkun Hazot in eighteenth-century Italy. Founded originally in 1655, it was soon dissolved, refounded in 1706, and soon dissolved again. When Hevrat Hazot emerged for the third time, however, in 1745, it was able within a short space of time to boast seventy members and to publish its own liturgical handbook.7' The year of its suc- cessful comeback was also the year in which the Jews of Verona were first warned about introducing women into their coffeehouses. From that point on Hevrat Hazot not only grew in popularity, but did so at the expense of its 68.

It may thus be argued that the spread of coffee played a role in the transformation of the veglia in Italy, between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from a festive celebration into a night-long rite of prayer and study.

Staying up late at night, it would appear, had become a more attractive choice than rising before dawn among those Veronese Jews interested in such rituals. In 1747 the minute-book of Shomrim la-Boker listed fifteen members who, during the past year alone, had crossed over to Hevrat Hazot and were therefore barred from casting ballots in confraternal elections. Nine years later, in 1755, the minute-book of Shomrim la-Boker terminated rather abruptly and somewhat mysteriously after 115 years, sug- gesting that the confraternity, too, had ceased to function.72 The Jewish coffeehouses of Verona, however, were still functioning at that date and still being warned about their clientele. The beverage in which they specialized and the new perception of the night which they represented would seem to have reversed the relative attractiveness of the two prayer rites championed by the two competing confraternities. Tikkun Hazot, previously the more forbidding of the two, had become the more convenient to observe. A similar pattern emerges in Mantua, where a Hevrat Hazot Laila was founded and dissolved intermittently during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. In 1790, however, it was founded anew by the members of the Hadashim la-Bekarim society, which, as its name suggests, had been devoted to predawn prayer.73 Here, too, the shift occurred during a period in which at least one coffeehouse was functioning in the community and in which sumptuary legislation referred frequently to the consumption of coffee.74 In Modena, as well, coffee appears as a controlled substance in the sumptuary laws of 1765.75 It was during that decade that the local Hevrat Hazot, although presumably founded earlier, began to show added vigor, publishing two liturgical handbooks for use by its members. The first, pub- lished in 1763, was intended for recitation at vigils held on the eve of a circumcision, and the second, published two years later, was an edition of 72.

The Ashmoret ha-Boker society of Modena, founded by R. Aaron Berachia almost a century and a half earlier, was evidently seriously weakened by the new strength shown by Hazot, for it soon sought to fortify itself through a merger. In 1768 it joined with the Jewish confraternity in Modena devoted to the care of the sick, forming the rather anomalous combination of Hevrat Ashmoret ha-Boker u-Vikkur Holim.77 It was not only in Italy that the growing popularity of coffee in the eighteenth century exerted an appreciable impact upon Jewish ritual and confraternal life. Even farther to the north, in Worms, the statutes of the Gemilut Hasadim society reveal a striking change in the status of the bever- age during that century, as well as clear evidence of its use in nocturnal rituals. In 1731 the confraternity decided that at its annual banquet no beverage other than wine or brandy would be served at its expense. Tea or coffee, it was added (perhaps half-seriously), would be considered as taboo, as was the "wine of the gentiles," although members could drink beer and "sour water" provided they brought their own.78 By 1763, however, the taboo was broken, and coffee joined wine and brandy among the "official" drinks the confraternity served at its banquets. In that same year, moreover, Gemilut Hasadim of Worms decided to provide coffee on two other occasions-the study vigils held on the nights of Shavuot and Hoshana Rab- bah. The member in whose home the vigil would be held was required to provide wine at his own expense, but the coffee would be paid for by the confraternity.79 The beverage had not only risen in status, but had come to 76.

Jonathan Eyebeschuetz in Metz during the 1740s. The latter, berating his congregants for their conservative resistance to spiritual reform, asked them why they so willingly drank coffee, tea, and chocolate even though these, too, were unknown to their ancestors. See his Ya'arot Devash (Jerusalem, 1984), vol. 2, p. 80, and see also the Jerusalem, 1972, edition, p. 67. I thank Prof. S. Z. Leiman for drawing my attention to this sermon.

The use of coffee as a metaphor for newness requires more extensive study.</page><page sequence="27">COFFEE, COFFEEHOUSES, AND NOCTURNAL RITUALS 43 be recognized as a necessary prerequisite for the observance of nocturnal vigils. The widening popularity of coffee in eighteenth-century Italy seems to have breathed new life into the observance not only of Tikkun Hazot, but also of the Shavuot and Hoshana Rabbah vigils. The history of their dis- semination in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is a more complicat- ed process than can be adequately chronicled and analyzed here. Yet it may be noted that only in the latter century, as coffee entered the fabric of every- day life in Italy, did mass-market editions of the readings for these two nights roll regularly off the presses. No less than eight editions of the Tikkun for Hoshana Rabbah appeared in Italy between 1728 and 1785, and in Venice alone no less than five editions of readings for Shavuot night were published between 1730 and 1767. These editions, moreover, were explicitly intended for use by those remaining awake all night, and contained prayers to be recited at the successful conclusion of the sleepless vigil.80 If coffee was in these years an integral part of the observance in Worms, its role could hardly have been less central in a city such as Venice, where the beverage was first introduced to Europe, and which, in the mid-eighteenth century, boasted some 200 coffeehouses, including some in its ghetto.8' In the Piazza San Marco, where the best-known of these were situated, a contemporary could experience night as "a dazzle of everlasting day." In other parts of the city it was also common for the cafes to remain open past midnight (despite the existence of regulations to the contrary) and for the principal thoroughfares to be thronged until early morning.82 With the advent of the coffeehouses as hubs of nocturnal sociability, in Venice and elsewhere in Italy, remaining awake past midnight became increasingly a way of life. Further research is admittedly required in order to show precise- ly how this shift affected Jewish society. It would appear, however, that the surge in the popularity of nocturnal rituals was one of its consequences. 80. See, for example, Tikkun Hoshana Rabbah (Venice, 1728), fol. 101a. This work appears to be modeled upon the edition of Amsterdam, 1727. For the earliest publication (1710) of the prayer to be recited at the end of the Hoshana Rabbah vigil, see Wilhelm, "Sidrei Tikkunim," p. 143. See also Tikkun Leil Shavuot (Venice, 1730), fol. 68a. In contrast to the editions of Shefer Tikkunim which began to appear in the seventeenth century (cf. above, n. 58), the all-night character of the Shavuot rite is stressed in its introduction.

This was due more to the availability of coffee than to the habit of frequenting coffeehouses, but the vogue achieved by the midnight rite of Tikkun Hazot would seem to have been equally linked to the latter. After long lagging behind the less-demanding observances of Shomrim la-Boker, it came, during the eighteenth century, to enjoy unprecedented popularity among Italian Jewry. Those Jews who, in increasing numbers, were in the habit of spending their evenings in the cafes of the ghettos evidently found it more attractive to recite Tikkun Hazot late at night than to rise even shortly before dawn for Shomrim la-Boker. The former rite was congruent with their lifestyle, while the latter clashed with it. The kabbalists, it should be noted, had insisted on the recitation of the Tikkun after midnight, but not on its recitation after a period of sleep. And lest it be overhastily objected that habitues of cafes are not the sorts of people to show enthusiasm for mystical night rituals, let it be noted that in the religious culture of the Mediterranean such combinations were, and indeed are, rather commonplace. An eighteenth-century traveler, for example, reports the observation concern- ing the Venetians that "they spend one half of their time in committing sin, and the other half in begging God's pardon."83 As Braudel has noted, "A whole book could be written on the devotion- al practices imported to all parts of Europe" by the men of the Mediter- ranean.84 We have here dealt with only a small chapter of that book, which must, of course, be a collaborative effort. Coffee and Tikkun Hazot, as we have noted, both originated in the Middle East and came gradually to Italy by way of the Mediterranean. News of both first arrived there late in the six- teenth century, and in the seventeenth their dissemination proceeded some- what haltingly. In the eighteenth century, however, both became integral features of the nightlife of Italian Jewry. The vigils of Shavuot and Hoshana 83.

The conspicuous role eventually accorded that beverage in their observance is perhaps most clearly evident in the account provided by a nineteenth-century Jewish traveler in North Africa. Concerning Shavuot he wrote, "On the first evening the families assemble in their houses," reading biblical portions aloud by turns, "and during the pauses, coffee and other refreshments are handed round." In Tripoli, on the night of Hoshana Rab- bah, he observed, "the reading is done as in Europe," but "between each part selichot is [sic] spoken and the shofar sounded; much coffee is drunk on the occasion.""'85 There are doubtless other sources from which the caffeine nexus of these vigils emerges with equal clarity. Although a separate study would be necessary to examine the impact of coffee on modern Jewish society and culture, let us conclude, by way of epi- logue, with two examples of the wider implications that a cup of coffee might have. The tension between the attractiveness of coffee as a stimulant and the less-than-wholesome image of the coffeehouse, evident in Radbaz's sixteenth-century responsum on the subject, continues to animate the reverie experienced one morning by Hirshl in Agnon's Simple Story. Upon waking in Buczacz (Szybusz) after a bad night's sleep, the following went through his mind: What he needed to put him back on his feet was a good cup of coffee. .. . A cup of strong coffee was his one hope of recovery-yet where was he going to get it? What passed for coffee in his home was merely coffee-colored milk. Once after his marriage he had been to Stanislaw and had drunk real coffee in a coffeehouse. Of course, there were such places in Szybusz too, but no self- respecting citizen would be caught in one. Here it is time for morning prayers, thought Hirshl, and all I can think of is coffeehouses. Yet what was so sinful about a coffeehouse? It was simply a mat- ter of local custom. Perhaps no decent person would frequent one in Szybusz, but there were towns where this was not at all the case.86 In Venice, where local custom had indeed endorsed the respectability of 85.

An ethnologist doing fieldwork in the ghetto of Venice a decade ago noted the custom of its Jews to visit a cafe immediately upon returning from a funeral. Then, as in centuries past, the body of the deceased would be transported by boat to the Lido, and return from a funeral thus entailed, in a wider sense, return to the ghetto. Signor Aboaff explained that "here, after a funeral you go for a drink so that the 'gezera' won't follow you home .... You go to a cafe... You take the disaster to a bar." Signora Sullam, another elderly resident of the ghetto, added, "On leaving the cemetery . . . We go to get coffee.
