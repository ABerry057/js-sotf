<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID: A STUDY IN INTERNAL POETIC COHESION by DAVID SEGAL Ben Gurion University of the Negev If Shmuel ben Yosef ha-Levi ibn Nagrella, better known as Shmuel ha-Nagid (938-1055), has been variously praised by his contemporaries, later medieval litterateurs and moderns as an innovative and forceful writer, his poetry qua poetry has been subjected to little close scrutiny. Three short poems have been analyzed as wholes;' individual stichs illustra- tive of typical figures and rhetorical devices in the Hebrew poetry of Spain NOTE: This article was prepared while the writer served on the faculty of the Hebrew College, Brookline, Massachusetts. AJSreview gratefully acknowledges the kind permission of Dr. Dov Jarden to reproduce the Hebrew texts of the poems discussed in this article from his edition of the Nagid's divan referred to below. 1.

In this essay, the writer adds to the beginnings made in the aesthetic analysis of Shmuel ha-Nagid's poetry by clarifying what is signi- fied by the genre of "martial poetry" and then by examining three martial poems that are compound-i.e., poems whose major segments differ in topic and tone. The study will disclose that all three are strikingly similar both in their content and in the manner in which their seemingly unrelated sections are closely bound together. I. The Genre of Martial Poetry Shmuel ha-Nagid is unique in the annals of medieval Jewry in penning Hebrew verses reflecting actual military experiences. While he was imitated in this by his son Yehosef, who wrote a few poems touching on martial valor, none of the latter's works has actually come down to us, with the exception of four stichs on homesickness written as a child with his father's help and appearing in his father's divan. The famed maqamist Judah al-Harizi devoted one tale-chapter seven of his Tah.qemoni- to a descrip- tion of a military encounter. The description, however, is clearly fictitious and derivative in no small measure from the Nagid's works. The precise definition of the Nagid's war poems is somewhat prob- lematic.5 D. S. Sassoon, who published the first edition of the Nagid's divan (index). (Halkin's edition replaces the earlier, free rendition of Ben Zion Halper, Shirat Yisra'el [Leipzig, 1924].) David Yellin, in his Spanish (Hebrew) Poetics [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1940), ex- pands significantly upon the work of Moses ibn Ezra, while retaining the former's categories and approach, and in the process cites the Nagid's poetry liberally. 3.

By no means do all the Nagid's "war poems" treat of military matters. Rather, it seems that their common denominator is some reference to martial pursuit. There might also be some mention in Yehosef's superscription that the poem was penned on the battlefield, or prior to a battle, or in the wake of military endeavor. Even this broad classification, however, cannot encompass at least one poem, #28 in DSH (one of the two added by Jarden), a four-stich apologia on the Nagid's part for errors in his major opus on Jewish law, Hilkhata gibberata."I A number of other poems do not qualify generically as poems of war, if by that we mean poems descriptive in one fashion or another of martial combat. Poems #812 and #3213 praise Yehosef for his penmanship and a poem of his, respectively; neither speaks of military affairs-except that the Nagid's grief mentioned in stichs 7-10 of #32 could be occasioned by dis- tress connected with military life. Two poems allude to a figure encountered in a martial poem, but are not themselves descriptive of battle. The first, #5, is a three-stich poem allegedly composed/read by the Nagid in his sleep, rejoicing over the downfall of one 6. David Solomon Sassoon, Diwan of Shemuel Hannagidh (London, 1934). 7.

In similar fashion, a four-stich poem of victory and thanksgiving, #12,'6 celebrates the downfall of a foe killed by subterfuge, but does not contain a battle scene. Another poem of questionable affinity to war poetry is #3,'7 a supplica- tion descriptive of grave danger. While the superscription explicitly identi- fies it as a prayer for help before battle, the contents, of themselves, do not specifically evoke military danger. One poem of illness, #36'8-the second of two poems that Jarden includes in war poems but Habermann does not-has no reference whatever to military life; again, it is only Yehosef's superscription, ascribing his father's weakness to aging during war (mi-derekh ha-ziqnah ba- milbamah), that links this poem to martial verse. Finally, other poems' mention of battle is minimal and/or tangential, such being poems concerning illnesses of Yehosef'9 and the Nagid.20 Poem #1 does not describe any military encounter; rather, it records a dream- vision whose last stich mentions dangers-specifically, swords.21 Given the above facts, it is doubtful that one can hope to classify rigor- ously the war poems of the Nagid both by theme and by essential and characteristic sections, as has been done by Pagis for the secular poetry of Moses ibn Ezra22-even if that poet, too, has a number of poems which defy easy classification, as Pagis points out.23 Perhaps one reason for the diffi- culty of so classifying the Nagid's poetry is that Moses ibn Ezra comes toward the end of an era and the Nagid comes at the beginning, when genres in Hebrew poetry were in the very process of being created-some, such as maxims and war poetry, at the hand of the Nagid himself! 14.

Introduction A. Praise of God (at times blending with, or replaced by, declara- tions of confidence or supplication).25 B. Background of the conflict-ranging from somewhat detailed description of political and military maneuvers, to a very brief mention (if at all) of events leading to battle.26 2. The martial nucleus of the poem (indispensable to the genre): men- tion/description of the battle-ranging from the fulsome descriptions 24. A major contribution of Pagis in Secular Poetry is the clear demonstration of differ- ences in style and content in the various-and rather stereotypic-segments of a given genre, say, the poem of friendship: there are, for example, fundamental shifts in attitude (as cheerful/gloomy) and perspective (personal/impersonal). Cf. Secular Poetry, pp. 116-21. Moreover, Pagis demonstrates that in many poems it is possible to extract a section which, seen in isolation, could readily be taken for a unit of another genre-such an instance being praise of a deceased person, which reads precisely like praise of one living (pp. 133-34). The considera- tion of such a dynamic in the genres of the Nagid is a high desideratum but one meriting independent treatment and lying outside the confines of this study, which will focus primarily on the linkages between the two major segments of the compound poem. In a future study, the writer intends to compare closing segments of self-praise to determine to what degree they might or might not be considered interchangeable-a topic suggested by Pagis himself, in private conversation, years ago. And in a forthcoming study the writer considers the relation- ship of an independent Ben Qohelet poem to a larger divan poem in which it is contained. 25. See n. 34 below, and Addenda A and B at the end of this study. 26. The longer background sections appear in the two longest of the Nagid's poems-#2 (in DSH) ss. 12-39 [political] and ss. 40-50 [military], pp. 5-7) and #4 (ss. 10-29 [or 10-38, if one considers the military conquests of the Nagid's troops described in ss. 30-38 as being antecedent to the main battle]), pp. 16-18. Other background sections include the following: #7, ss. 21-25, pp. 32-33; #13, ss. 14-21, pp. 45-46; #16, ss. 11, 16, 20, p. 53 (all these being at once part of the battle description, as the participants, their motivation and arrival are here given); #24, ss. 7-24, pp. 74-75; #26, ss. 23-26, p. 87; #29, s. 12 (here following a stich descrip- tive of battle), p. 97; and #40, ss. 22-23, pp. 144-45 (although construable as part of the battle). Other background descriptions are one stich or less than one stich, for the most part transi- tional in purpose and general, rather than conveying specific events leading up to the conflict: #9, s. 16, p. 37; #27, s. 12 (here following a stich descriptive of the battle), p. 97; #31, s. 17, p. 105; #34, s. 8 (again within the description of the enemy's activities), p. 115.</page><page sequence="6">170 DAVID SEGAL of his early poems, #2 and #4, to others where very few stichs suffice, sometimes as an aside.

Ps. 19:15 and 69:32); asking blessing and/or deliverance of God: #9, s. 37, p 38; #18, ss. 59-62, p. 61; #34, ss. 21-22, p. 116; triumphant return from battle: #41, ss. 27-30, p. 145; con- cern with the day of judgment: #16, s. 60, p. 56 (and cf. #36, ss. 37-42, p. 124); God's rendering just retribution (on earth): #25, ss. 63-64, p. 85; #30, ss. 40-41, p. 101; and declaration of the Nagid's salvation: #26, ss. 99-100, p. 95. 33. Scholars are divided over the question of the Nagid's Ben Tehillim being (1) synony- mous with his divan, (2) incorporated therein or (3) as yet undiscovered. In "Ben Tehillim of Shmuel Hanagid and the Book of Psalms: A Study in Esoteric Linkage," Ph.D. diss., Brandeis University, 1976, pp. 1-12, the writer summarizes this debate and attempts to substantiate the second of the above three positions. Nehemiah Allony, in a forthcoming article titled "Diwan and Ben Tehillim by Shmuel ha-Nagid" [Hebrew] also reviews this controversy and supports the first position. 34. Addendum A at the end of this paper presents a chart of 29 poems of the Nagid-28 of them are war poems-containing initial praise and, more than that, those components of the individual psalm of thanksgiving agreed upon by most biblical scholars as basic to the genre: initial praise; mention of the (past) danger-at times with calling on God; the fact of divine rescue; and final praise-at times followed by calling on others to praise. Cf. Fleming James, Thirty Psalmists (New York, 1965), pp. 163-86; Claus Westermann, The Praise of God in the Psalms, trans. K. R. Crim (Richmond, 1965), pp. 102-16; and Sigmund Mowinckel, The Psalms in Israel's Worship, trans. D. R. Ap-Thomas (Oxford, 1962), 2: 31-43. Addendum B presents, similarly, sections of 12 divan poems-nine being war poems-with marked resemb- lance to segments of the Psalter's hymn genre: summons to praise God; the reason(s) for praise-God's acts in nature and/or history; and concluding praise. See James, Thirty Psalm- ists, pp. 15-19; Mowinckel, The Psalms, pp. 81-105; Westermann, The Praise, pp. 15-35 and 152-55. Westermann emphasizes the basic similarity of psalms of praise (hymns) and songs of thanksgiving. Cf. also Mowinckel, 2: 87; and M. H.

Two martial poems treat of illness in stichs intermingled with description of the martial incident.41 One martial poem has as its preface a riddle poem of two strains: a description of wine's power and praise of the Nagid's lineage, praise ending with an adjuration to Yehosef to live up to his family heritage.42 One poem- of 100 stichs-treats, at its outset and close, the Nagid's labors and method in compiling a work on the oral law.43 Two martial poems contain stichs descriptive of heavenly bodies, with one of them describing other scenes in nature and society.44 One poem that mentions martial activity is primarily an adjuration to Yehosef to study written Arabic.45 Finally, two poems of the Nagid-among his last martial poems-blend martial verse with self-praise and praise/ friendship.46 In conclusion, it can be stated that poems which, to date, have been classed together as war poems sometimes relate only tangentially to warfare. Poems that do treat military matters are in this study referred to as "martial" poems. Such poems frequently exhibit bracketing of the nuclear (battle) section of the poem with political-military background, and some- times praise of God, at the outset, and at the close, with such components as praise of God and/or the poem, and exhortation as to the poem's dissemina- tion and use.

"Levavi be-qirbi .am" ("My Heart Is Hot Within Me") Traditionally, a major model for secular Hebrew poetry in Spain, namely the qasida, has been perceived by students of Arabic letters as a bi- furcated creation whose two segments-mourning over lost love, and description(s) of a journey and/or battle and/or patron-are essentially unrelated.47 A similar position on the essential unrelatedness of basic seg- ments of longer Hebrew poems has been taken by Hebrew scholars. Moses ibn Ezra speaks of introductory love sections to poems of praise as essen- tially unrelated to what follows them, and faults poets who write in this fashion-even if he himself at times falls into that category!48 In the twen- tieth century, D. Yellin is quite explicit in pointing to the Arabic qasida patrimony of the medieval Hebrew poems of praise and describes opening sections on love, wine, nature or other themes that are linked with lyric poetry as being distinctly set apart from the praise sections following.49 Other scholars share in the judgment that longer Hebrew secular poems are marked by disunity.50 A central thesis of D. Pagis in his detailed study of Moses ibn Ezra's poetic theory and practice is the essential-albeit not total!--unrelatedness of major segments of poems, certainly poems whose initial sections are of genres different from their main ones.5' 47. Ibn Qutaiba, author of The Book of Poetry and Poets [Arabic], ed. M. Gaudefroy- Demombynes (Paris, 1947), is frequently cited for his description of the qafida as a type of poem with sterotypic sections basically unrelated one to another-as in A. J. Arberry, The Seven Odes: The First Chapter in Arabic Literature (London and New York, 1957), pp. 15-16 and H. A. R. Gibb, Arabic Literature, 2d rev. ed. (Oxford, 1963), pp. 15-16 (in a general dis- cussion of the qafida on pp. 13-31). See also Reynold A. Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs (Cambridge, 1922), pp. 76-78, 134 and 288; and A. J. Arberry, Arabic Poetry: An Intro- duction (Cambridge, 1965), pp. 17-18. 48. Moses ibn Ezra, Mubh4aara, sec. 141b, pp. 272-75. Pagis, in his Secular Poetry, p. 143, holds that the Arabic original signifies more (unrelated) topics than love.

Mirsky has shown that in a number of poems of friendship of Shlomo ibn Gabirol and Yehuda ha-Levi, patterns of recurring motifs and roots, and in some cases, patterns of allusion form a like phenomenon; the major figure in the first component of the compound poem-be that figure a sorceress or a handsome young man or an attractive young woman who is the object of lavish praise-is the veiled prefiguration of the person- age to whom the "body" of the poem is addressed.5 Yael Feldman shows a like pattern in compound poems of friendship of Moses ibn Ezra, a pattern whereby the implicit linkage of the friend/patron with a central figure in the first section is such that the superiority of the friend/patron to that figure is emphasized.54 In the analysis below, the writer shows an underlying system of cohesion operative in three martial poems of Shmuel ha-Nagid: the personal frustra- tions and griefs expressed by the poet in the first and seemingly unrelated section of the compound poem are resolved supralogically in the second, as he imposes upon his foes the anguish that has been his and undergoes a complete reversal of mood from gloom to joy. "Levavi be-qirbi bam" or "My Heart Is Hot Within Me" does indeed appear to consist of two sharply disparate sections, recalling the "mosaic" style of the Arabic qafida. In the first section, ss. 1-15, the Nagid laments the ruin of Zion at the hands of Edom; in ss. 16-37 he describes a victory in Muslim Spain over a rebel against his monarch, Badis of Granada. The linkage between the two sections seems purely local, typical of that medieval Hebrew poetic stylistic termed tiferet ha-ma'avar-"the elegant transi- tion."55 The Nagid seems to have abandoned totally the subject and concern of section one. 52. See, for example, Raymond Scheindlin, Form and Structure in the Poetry of Al- Mu'tamid ibn 'Abbad (Leiden, 1974), especially his Introduction (pp. 1-30) and notes 9, 10 and 19; and Hamori, On the Art, esp. chap.

E" to " - - " n TT T T T: T : T x Vi 4,= inarfm3 T 7 : I : T The poem may be summarized as follows: in the first section, the Nagid expresses sadness and longing for the Levitical cities of his forebears (1). He yearns fo see Jewish pilgrims streaming from the Exile to Mount Zion (2, 3), where the young men and women of Jewish society redeemed will display the splendor of virtuous living, untainted by immoral behavior (4-7). Zion, however, lies in enemy hands-inaccessible, wasted and desolate (8-9). At this sight the poet mourns bitterly (10-11), calling upon God to see His people's degradation, restore them, and bring down their ancient foe (12-15). In the second section, linked to the first by a transition verse (16), the Nagid describes the efforts of a former ally of his monarch, and a relative as well, to seek refuge in a fortress (16-17). The fortress is besieged, with attendant tumult, bloodshed, carnage and looting (18-26). The two allies of the rebellious foe are taken, and he himself flees and is captured (29-31). The poet then exults in victory, praises God, dedicates the poem to Him and prays for continued success (33-37). Viewed in accordance with the sequen- tial model of martial poetry, the second section can be seen as comprising the following: a brief introduction of the background of the conflict (16-17); the martial nucleus, here substantial (18-31); and a conclusion with praise of God (32-36) and petition (37). Despite what appears to be the joining together of two disparate poems, there are actually many and subtle linkages which make the work far more unified than at first appears to be the case. The first stich of section two (16) contains a double epithet describing the Nagid's foe: ba'al meri va-'ahtimelekh, "the rebel and king's kin." Now</page><page sequence="13">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 177 such doubling is not unusual in the context of this poem: the stichs abound in paired terms, either synonymous or complementary, albeit primarily at the ends of the verses. Yet it is noteworthy that this verbal feature is almost a duplication of what appears in s. 13: va-'ahbot 'uv ba'alat boib ve-labba'at- "the sister of Uz is possessor of ornament and ring." To emphasize the close relationship, let us juxtapose the two phrases, rendering the first more liter- ally: ba'al meri va-'abimelekh the possessor of rebellion and brother of the king va-'abot 'uS ba'alat bobz ve-labba'at the sister of Uz is possessor of ornament and ring. In both verses the enemies described are possessors and siblings. Stich 21 reveals another linkage between the two sections and the two enemies. The Edomites-i.e., Christians-who control the Holy Land are gloriously attired, while Judah (the people of Israel) is naked (13); and in s. 21, nobles who previously were gloriously attired are cloaked in blood: ha-lo te'enaf ki bat yehudah 'arummah min kesut/ va-'abot 'uS ba'alat hbob ve-tabba'at (s. 13). We have here a double entendre, metulla'at meaning at once "clothed in scarlet" and "bloodied." It would seem, then, that the enemy of section two is suffering a punishment appropriate to the enemy of section one-the "sis- ter of Uz" who possesses "ornament and ring" while the daughter of Judah is "naked of garment." To proceed further in this vein, the phrase 'adat ramim, "the company of the haughty" (21), recalls the description of the enemy in section one, tadur 'alei 'ash (12), "dwelling above the stars" (liter- ally, "the Great Bear"). Furthermore, ss. 21 and 23, with references to arrows employed in the conquest of the foe, recall s. 15 wherein the Nagid prays that God shower his foes with arrows! ve-haspeh bavavekha be-voprah ve-hashqeh khos le-teiman mele'ah me- hamatakh ve-sora'at (s. 15) ve-sarim levushei shesh me'oddam me'oddamim be-bes va-'adat ramim be- damim metulla'at (s. 21) ve-qamnu ve-'alinu le-rosho be-sullam min qeshatot u-ma'lat zbe? le-lev rakh meyagga'at (s. 23).</page><page sequence="14">178 DAVID SEGAL The plea in that same stich 15 that God force Yemen to quaff "a cup of Your hot wrath, full and overflowing" anticipates s. 33: ve-haspeh zbasayekha be-voprah ve-hashqeh khos le-teiman mele'ah me- bamatakh ve-sora'at (s. 15) 'ani 'esht kos yesha' ve-khos 'al yeshu'ati ve-hu yesht qiqalon u-voshet be- qubba'at (s. 33). The emerging picture becomes clearer. The enemy facing the Nagid is not merely a personal foe but the archetypal enemy of Israel. This point is rendered explicitly in other poems;56 here it is more subtly conveyed. Fur- thermore, the conquest of this enemy appears to embody-by poetic logic- the divine salvation longed for so passionately in the first section of the poem. The foe ascending above the stars in s. 12 is trampled underfoot in s. 26; and it is the Nagid and his forces who ascend-a "ladder of bows and a stairway of arrows." 'elohim ha-la'ad ta'aleh bat 'edom tadur 'alei 'ash u-vat siyyon be-lev yam meshuqqa'at (s. 12) ve-qamnu ve-'alinu le-rosho be-sullam min qeshatot u-ma'lat be$ le-lev rakh meyagga'at (s. 23) In s. 8 the lion Edom roars and locks the Jews out of the Holy Land; in section two, especially ss. 16-18, he is himself locked in his fortress, a pri- soner. In contrast with the (prayed for) jubilant singing of the redeemed pilgrims in ss. 2 and 3, and the triumphant shouts of the Nagid's troops in s. 22, and the jubilant singing of the Jewish community in s. 36 in the end-the foe shouts in death agony in s. 26. In the sphere of allusion, the pattern of "measure for measure" is still further attested. Stich 9 speaks of the adversary having wrested the beautiful 56. As for example in #4, pp. 16-26, where the foe is identified with, or likened to, various foes of Israel: Amalek-ss. 43, 47; Arabs/Ishmael-ss. 14, 102; Babylonia-ss. 19, 70; Edom-s. 71; Egypt-s. 41; Moab-s. 45; Midian-s. 86; Philistines-ss. 14, 102; and foes of Israel in general-ss. 56, 79. Also #7, p. 33, s. 31: #9, p. 36, ss. 12, 13, 15; and cf. Gerson D. Cohen, Sefer Ha-Qabbalah by Ibn Daud: The Book of Tradition (Philadelphia, 1967), p. 277 and n. 86.</page><page sequence="15">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 179 ornaments from the Temple (literally: "the wall"). This wresting from a wall recalls Leviticus 14:34-40, which details the treatment that is to be tendered walls of houses considered leprous: "Then the priest shall command that they take away [baleyu-the same verb as "wrested" in s. 9] the stones in which the plague is and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city." This allusion explains the significance of s. 17 of our poem: He thought to escape with his life in his stronghold/ but he entered it and a curse stuck to it like leprosy. And appropriately, the Nagid, a Levite if not a priest, has the stones removed-but not for purposes of cleaning or replacement! Two key words in their repetitions throughout the poem, heart and eye, lev and 'ayin, reveal the "measure for measure" punishment of the foe mentioned above. The Nagid's heart burns and his eye weeps in longing (1); he sees in his mind's eye the ruined Temple (10); his eye trembles and his heart groans as though it were cleft by the spear of an enemy (11). In section two, the Nagid's eye enjoys seeing his craven opponent's forces appear as small as grasshoppers and worms (18)-and he sees his own troops triumphant (22). The foe flees with heart "agitated and melted" (29), having gone mad because of what his eye had seen done to his comrades (31). Even words employed only twice contribute to this pattern of reversed affliction. In s. 12 the "daughter of Zion" is "plunged into (meshuqqa'at) the heart of the seas"; in s. 28 the feet of a foeman are "plunged (meshuqqa'at) into stocks." In conclusion, the actual enemy of Shmuel ha-Nagid in section two is identified with the composite enemy of Israel responsible in section one for the destruction of the Temple, the Exile and the prevention of the Jewish return; and through a "measure for measure" punishment of this foe, the Nagid experiences an exaltation of spirit that supralogically con- stitutes that very salvation and vengeance prayed for but not attained in section one. III. "Zekhor libbi be-tuv" ("In Good Days, 0 My Heart, Remember") Like "Levavi be-qirbi bam" ("My Heart Is Hot Within Me"), "Zekhor libbi be-luv" appears at first sight to be a poem of disparate components: the first section (1-17) comprises an anxious confession of sin and the second is</page><page sequence="16">180 DAVID SEGAL a martial poem of clearly definable sections: exhortation on the inscribing and dissemination of the poem (18-21); a description of the war and the resultant victory (22-32); sententiae (33, 34); praise of God for His deliver- ance (35-39) and dedication of the poem to God (40-44); and praise of the poem (44-50). One might even question the indispensability of the last-cited section (44-50) to the martial poem (18-32). Certainly, the relationship of the first section of the compound poem to what follows, without attention to the stylistic features of the Nagid's poetry touched on thus far, would be far from clear.

Friends' expres- sions of astonishment at his fear, in light of his many goodly acts to his people (10-13), the Nagid scorns (14), for he knows how he has recom- pensed God's good treatment with evil behavior (15-16); yet withal, he resolves to trust God who has bestowed largesse upon him gratis (17)-and herein the poet hints at the topic to be embarked upon in the very next stich. The Nagid begins section two by instructing Yehosef to copy the victory poem and send it on to Jerusalem (18-21), informing all of how the boast- ing foe, confident at the outset, retreated in shamed silence to fortifica- tions in the face of the onslaught of the Nagid's troops (22-26). Foiled by God for being scoffers, they were forced to hear and obey the foe they had just disregarded and witness the devastation of their land (27-29). The formerly powerful enemy nation sank impotently to ignoble defeat (30-32). Following two maxims-one on the sure fall of a person with a wounded leg (33) and the other on the efficacy of forcing double returns from robbers (34)-the poet thanks God for having aided him in time of severe danger and having cut down his foe, giving the latter over to the Nagid as fatted lambs were handed over to priests in Temple times (35-39). The poet starts the final section by dedicating the poem to God, who provided him with plenty, renewed his youth and saved him; to Him he offers mellifluous and artfully constructed song recalling David's psalms (40-45). Its declamation shall bring joy to the people and rejuvenation to the desert (46). While earth may know arid seasons, the poem shall never lose its freshness (47). It shall shed light and joy (48), be recited in holy places and at weddings (49) and shall be sung (in the Messianic era) when the Jews, redeemed, march up to Zion (50). Close reading soon makes evident the fact that here, much as in "Levavi be-qirbi bam," we have the presentation of a deeply felt personal problem that is obliquely "resolved," as may be seen by tracing recurring roots and motifs: the poet sees himself as hopelessly stained by sin in section one; in the martial nucleus of the poem it is the foe who is implicitly presented as sinful, and the Nagid associated with divine judgment and priestly purity. In</page><page sequence="19">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 183 the poem's conclusion, the Nagid's original deficiencies-in their particu- larity!-are reversed, as is the initial mood of gloom. Below, major motifs and roots exemplifying these and related progres- sions are listed: Here section I refers to ss. 1-17; II, to the martial nucleus (22-32) and the preceding exhortation to Yehosef (18-21) and attached sen- tentiae (33, 34); and III to the dedication/praise to God (40-45) and praise of the poem (46-50). 1. Writing: In I the Nagid's sin is written (ketuvah-4) on his forehead and his murky fate written (nikhtav-7) in his book; in II Yehosef is adjured to set down in writing (ha-ketivah) on a smooth scroll (18) the Nagid's vic- tory; in III the Nagid's poem is the acme of beauty, likened to finely carved, chiseled and trimmed materials (44, 45). 2. Mouth and Speech: At first the Nagid's mouth (peh) testifies against him (3); in II the foe boasts and then is forced to fall silent (23); in III the Nagid's poem is to be placed in redeemed Jews' mouths (be-fi-50) and be sweet upon the lips of reciters. 3. Sinfulness: I is replete with the Nagid's confession and consciousness of his sin. In II his intended audience, the Jerusalemites, are described as those whose sin is forgiven (21); and the enemy is depicted as implicitly sinful-speaking arrogantly (23) and scheming like scoffers (27). In addi- tion, by the end of II the Nagid, in a bold metaphor, imaginatively identi- fies himself with the priestly class, the recipients of the offerings of Israel (including, of course, sin offerings)-as God gives him the enemy's flesh as his due (38, 39). Finally, in III all mention of sin is far removed indeed. The song of the Nagid is much the opposite of tainted: psalm-like (43), it is to be sung by the redeemed Jews ascending to Zion (50). 4. Judgment: In I the Nagid fears his final judgment (3, 9); in II his forces, like Noah's waters (26) implicitly constitute the execution of judgment upon the foe, and the Nagid likens his action to the rendering of biblical judgment (34). 5. Provisions: Concerned about inadequate spiritual provisions in I (9), the Nagid in II sees his foes deprived of actual provisions (25, 32) and in III is himself sated with good and with salvation (41-42). 6. Youth (n'r) and Good (twb): At the poem's outset (1) good times (be-Juv, be-tovah) are dissociated from youth (no'ar); at the poem's close (41) the Nagid's mouth is sated with good (be-tuv) and his youth (ne'urim) re- newed. 7. Day (ywm): In I, the days (yemei) of youth are censured (1) and the Nagid</page><page sequence="20">184 DAVID SEGAL fears the day (yom) of judgment (3) as well as his (final) day (ve-yomi-5, be-yomi-6); in III the day (yom) of danger (35), through God's rescue, becomes the equivalent of a festive day (yom-38). 8. Love ('hb): In I the Nagid is undeserving of the largesse of his God, who acts lovingly (ke-'ohev-16); in II he is worthy of sending a missive to upright, loving ('ohev) dwellers of beloved (ha-'ahuvah) Jerusalem (21); in III he predicts the recitation of his paean in holy places, under the wedding canopies of beloved ('ahuvah) brides (49). 9. Journeying (hlk): In I the Nagid speaks, in anxious tones, about going ('elekh-9) on his final journey; in II he and his troops go (be-lekhtenu) to devastate the foe and his land (24); in III the Nagid's poem illumines the night for those who go (holekhei derekh) upon the way (48). In summation, the claims made on the poem's behalf are at the same time self-consolation, in the deepest sense: in the very writing of the poem the Nagid has, as it were, lit his own path and gladdened his soul. Put otherwise: if the Nagid felt hopelessly marred by sinfulness at the outset, fol- lowing the war and his perception thereof as presented in the poem, he felt himself purged-so much so as to have penned a psalm-like poem worthy of recitation for his contemporaries and in the Messianic era. IV. "Ha-'e'evor nabalei 'einai" ("Shall I Stem the Streams of My Eyes?") "Ha-'e'evor nabalei 'einai" ("Shall I Stem the Streams of My Eyes?"), titled "Tehillah" (Praise), is readily divisible into two basic segments, each in turn subdividable. Section one (1-14) presents the Nagid's grief over Zion's ruin (1-7) and a description of the night sky (8-14), the two being linked in the tradition of the nasib, the love complaint of Arabic poetry, wherein the tormented lover, having looked upon the remains of the encampment of his departed mistress, spends a sleepless night regarding the heavens." After a transitional stich (15), the martial poem ensues, comprising an account of a military victory (16-48) and consequent praise of God (49-56). To render yet more evident, as it were, the division of this compound poem into its basic segments the Nagid has bracketed the first section with a root-repetition-word-play combination (or inclusion): "Shall I stem the streams of my eyes and rest (ve-'anubah) when the sons of Hamath 57.

(1); " . . . while the congregation of fools are good-heartedly at rest [u-vi-menubah]" (14). This stylistic feature of setting apart the first segment of a compound poem is the more striking in that both poems previously considered exhibit a like bracketing. Poem #9's first section (1-15) is bracketed by the word play bam (hot) and Ilamat (the same city to be mentioned in #31, s. l!) in s. 1, and me-bamatakh (of Your hot wrath) (15); the first section of #22 is bracketed by forms of the root twb (good): be-tuv (in good days), be-tovah (in good times) (1) and be-metiv ii (in Him who has ... done good to me) (17).58 The text of the poem follows: - -- -T T--: T T : " T ": T " : " "" T T. : " T TT:: T " T" T T %.T...

Other instances of bracketing of initial segments of compound poems by repeating roots and/or word play (discounting prepositions) in war poems (#1-#40 in DSH) include the fol- lowing: #16, pp. 52ff., ss. 1 and 8-"ve-gadelu ke-migdalim" ("towered like towers") and "godlo" ("His might"); #26, pp. 85ff., ss. 1 and 22, "be-lo rish" ("without destitution") and "horish" ("has left as legacy"); #27, pp. 89ff., ss. 1 and 60- "peh" ("mouth") and "u-feh" ("and a mouth"); #39, pp. 134ff., ss. 1 and 22, "panim" ("face") and "u-fanim" ("and face"); and #41, pp. 143ff., ss. 1 and 19, "zeman" ("time/fate") and "zemani" ("my time/fate"). The close scrutiny of this bracketing stylistic in the works of the Nagid and other medieval Hebrew poets and its comparison with the phenomenon of inclusion in biblical poetry is a desideratum.</page><page sequence="22">186 DAVID SEGAL :n*avy My Ini a fl 9 lang pi. ,'0'*?1* 0 bf py al spq . rl -- :T :--: ":-: " ") .MfT Ti "-- T": --: T T T: "T : -: " .~ng byn nippn n wniu nr ,23"1 ftif I y UPQ9ZV ' T Tr: T" : " * T T- T T " -: T .nna n- a, 1- an0EV a9=6161noi T : T T T: T T TT : T T TT: T T T:: T: : T T: T : -: T ;,nfgTf poi O? ,91f l1 -!

Attentiveness to recurring roots and shared motifs reveals that the calumny and grief imposed upon the Nagid's foes in section two is a punishment for Zion's destruction in the first section; i.e., the two foes are perceived as one. Primary motifs relating to this scheme are weeping/mourning and joy; terri- tory; family ties; life; speech (sybt); and the heart (lbb). Furthermore, a number of themes touched upon in the portraiture of the heavens prefigure themes developed later in the poem, such as the obedience of a son, feet and the figure of the deer, and the cup. The sections of the poem shall be indi- cated here in a fashion similar to that employed in discussing #9 and #22: the first segment of this compound poem shall be called I, comprising the Nagid's grief over Zion (lA: 1-7) and the description of the night sky (IB: 8-14). The martial nucleus (15-48) shall be II; and concluding praise of God (49-56), III. The above-cited motifs and recurring roots follow.</page><page sequence="24">188 DAVID SEGAL 1. Weeping/mourning and joy: At the outset the Nagid weeps copiously over Zion's ruin (1), groaning and lamenting (7). In II, joy attaches to the troops of the Nagid (21); conversely, the laments of the enemy's wives (anticipated) are mentioned in taunts hurled at the foe, together with mention of rites appropriate to mourning (27-28). In addition, the enemy troops shriek in distress (21) and are sated with grief (45). Finally, in III, the Nagid is jubilant (45), indeed to the point of nearly expiring (52). 2. Territory: In I, exiled Zion's territory has been seized by Arameans (1-3); in II the foe is forced to flee held territory (the plain) for the moun- tains (23-24); in III the Nagid says he will spread the news of his victory to all points of the compass, paralleling God's delivery of him "east and west" (55-56). 3. Family Ties: In I Zion is a woman divorced (2-3), contrasted with a placid heavenly scene-the Great Bear with her children (11); in II the foe's wives are referred to as widows in anticipation (27, 38); and in III, recalling the banishment of the "daughters of Zion" (2), "sons and daughters" will disseminate tidings of the victory (56). 4. Life: The poet despairs of life at the outset-"mah li be-bzayyim" (4); in II the foe, though alive (bayyim), is accounted dead because of his coward- ice (42). 5. Speech (syb): When the Nagid speaks (ve-'asibah) in I (7), he is grief- filled. Quite the reverse holds in II when the Nagid, with his men, speaks out (sahbnu) in mockery at the cowardice of the foe (24) and their empty boasts (34); finally, in III the Nagid's tongue, praising God, is like a sword (49). 6. Heart: The grief of the Nagid's heart (libbi-7) and the good-heartedness (joy, be-luv-levav-14) of evildoers in I are balanced in II by the foe's folly of the heart (be-libbah-22) and faintheartedness (rakh-levavo- 33). In III, where almost exactly the same idiom appears as in s. 7-"ve-'asim 'alei libbi" (I take [this] to heart)-the Nagid states that he notes God's daily deliverance of him-'asim 'alei libbi (54). As has been noted above (p. 24), there are in IB at least three prefigura- tions of later scenes in the poem: 7. Obedience of a Son: The description, in IB, of Orion as a foolish son (ben) breaking away wrongly from his star-clan (10) at once prefigures the Nagid's warning to his son (beni) Yehosef to walk on the right path</page><page sequence="25">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 189 (15) and his description of the foe as one who despises the obligations of legal treaties (48). 8. Feet and Deer: The description of the Pleiades as capering like a roe (ka-'ayyalah) albeit with no feet (regel) (12) at once prefigures the flight of the foe to their mountain retreat like stags (ka-'ayyalim) and the sure-footedness (ragli) of the Nagid in victory (53). 9. Cup: The depiction of the stars as being colored like wine-filled cups (kosot-9) prefigures the cups (kosot) of salvation tendered the Nagid (50). In a pattern markedly similar to the one we have seen in poems #9 and #22 above, #31, a compound poem, presents an initial section characterized by frustration and grief, and that in a situation that seems to admit of no remedy. This complaint is followed by a martial poem wherein a process of catharsis takes place, a process highlighted by recurring motifs and roots: the foe of the first section is metamorphosed into the enemy of the second; and that second foe's shaming not only leads to a reversal of the Nagid's mood and consequent praise of God, but is taken as poetic justice- rendering retribution to the ravager of Zion. V. Summary This study has shown that the category of war poems of Shmuel Hanagid can admit a subcategory of "martial poems"-those poems that actually cite or describe military activity, however briefly. This category lends itself to description, in part, along the lines laid out by D. Pagis in his categorization of the poetry of Moses ibn Ezra. The nuclear component, that citing/ describing battle, is at times prefaced by an introduction containing, variously, (A) praise of God, or confidence in Him, or supplication and/or (B) a description of military-political conditions leading up to battle. It is often followed by such concluding components as further praise/dedication- of-the-poem to God, praise of the poem or self, exhortation as to the poem's dissemination and/or use, or final petition. Also, in compound poems, the martial segment is often prefaced by segments of other genres. Attending to the varied components of the martial poem-especially as they appear in typical or frequent sequences-brings home its affinity to the psalmic genres of the hymn and personal thanksgiving, each of whose dis- crete and typical components are variously mirrored in many martial poems of the Nagid. This fact strengthens the argument of those who would either</page><page sequence="26">190 DAVID SEGAL identify the war poems of the Nagid as being the same as, or a major reposi- tory of, the poems of the much-debated corpus Ben Tehillim. Three compound-martial poems have been studied here; all three have been shown to be markedly similar in their components and in their patterns of overall cohesion. All begin with deep-felt grief and frustration over seem- ingly insoluble problems-personal sinfulness (#22) and Zion's ruin (#9 and #31); and all pass on to apparently unrelated topics, these being military triumphs of the Nagid. Yet, when the language whereby these same triumphs are described is scrutinized, it becomes apparent that the Nagid has in each instance perceived his victory as, in effect, a supralogical resolu- tion of his dilemma: while the poet does not openly state that victories over princelings of Andalusia can in any way redeem Zion or whitewash his sinful record, this is, in effect, what these three poems suggest.59 The unity of each poem has been attested primarily by the density of root repetition and motif repetition, and that in similar patterns of reversal of mood and situation of both the Nagid and his imaginatively fused foe. Such a pattern argues for genuine linkage rather than random or insignificant repetition, and this argument is bolstered by the demonstration that major elements of the same pattern hold in three like martial poems. To state the above is not to claim "organic unity" in these three poems of the Nagid, or in his poetry generally, if by such a term one means the shap- ing of all of a poem's components by an underlying focus or dynamic, such that all progressions, all figures of speech, all words can be seen as being (A) necessary outgrowths of such a conception or dynamic, and (B) tightly determined by the other elements of the poem. Certainly no attempt has been made-nor could it succeed-to show that every phrase is indispens- able to a poem's message. On the other hand, it has been shown that there is operative a genuine and strong cohesion between segments within martial poems-a cohesion that has heretofore gone unnoticed. To what degree such patterns of cohesion hold for other poems of the Nagid and Hebrew poets of Spain generally is a topic for further research. 59. The student of Jewish historiography is referred to Cohen, Sefer Ha-Qabbalah, esp. pp. 223-303, where Cohen demonstrates from ibn Daud's work and primary Hebrew sources of Muslim Spain-particularly poetry (including poems by and to the Nagid)-that Spanish Jewish leadership viewed itself, and was itself viewed internally, as an active participant in the messianic process.</page><page sequence="27">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 191 ADDENDUM A SECTIONS OF WAR AND NATURE POEMS RESEMBLING SECTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PSALMS OF THANKSGIVINGa Explicit Calling Call Answer/ Declaration Others to 0 Pages Praise Danger To God Rescue of Praise Praise 2 4-14 11 12-69 70-81, 31, 44, 51, 137 143-149 82-94 95-131 4 16-26 7-8 10-27, 58-60, 8, 45, 115-119, 145-146 45-57 61-63 66-131 137-139 5 27 3 1-3 1,3 1, 3 (?) 6 27-30 3-5 (13-25), 53 55-56 7 31-34 22-25 21,26, 35-37 35-37 9 35-38 16 34 34-35 36 11 27 27 21-22 26-27 29c 12 2 1 1-4 4 13 44-47 1, 14 14-23 24-31 32-33 14 49 6-10 13 19 16 52-56 9 9-17, 9-25, 42-43, 25-39 40,41 57 18 57-61 1-4b 5-8, 9, 35, 36, 46 37-40 41, 42 20 62-65 27-28 29-30 29 40 22 35-36 19, 36, 40-43 37-43 24 74-79 3 5, 6 36-38, 73 69-72 25 80-85 19-23b 23-43 44-58 59 aThis table lists 29 divan poems having sections that resemble typical sections of the individual psalm of thanksgiving.

A literal rendering has been the goal here, albeit one that is neither stilted nor unclear. Given the significance of root repetition, as demonstrated in the analyses of the poems, stems that recur in the Hebrew are represented by recurring English stems, with rare exception: as "high" and "haughty" for the root rwm in #9, ss. 21, 31 and 32; and "path" for the root drk in #22, ss. 9, 48 and 50. Another translation of #9 may be found in Weinberger, Jewish Prince, pp. 54-56. Unpleasant as it is to fault the work of a fellow devotee of the Nagid, it must be said that Weinberger is frequently inaccurate. Thus s. 5's benot yeshurun is construed as "singing maidens," but can only mean either "singing maidens of Jeshu- run [Israel]" or "princesses" (or: "noble maidens of Jeshurun"); s. 6, in the poem's context, must be construed as future action, not past; s. 7's descrip- tion of the prince's daughter "who in the nut garden placed her fawn by a lily to be gathered and planted" can in no way be supported by the Hebrew text; ve-hinneh 'arayot yish'agu sham in s. 8 is not "behold the roaring lions who occupy it"; the rendition of the (ongoing) subject of description, in s. 9, as "she" rather than "it"-so rendered in s. 8-confuses the reader; and so on. A poetic version of #9 by the writer is scheduled to appear in a future issue of Hebrew Studies under the title of "'My Heart Burns' by Shmuel Hanagid: A Considered Translation." For allusions to, and illustrations of, biblical or talmudic usages of words and phrases appearing in the Hebrew, see DSH, pp. 35-38 (#9), pp. 67-70 (#22) and pp. 103-8 (#31). The pheno- menon of overall allusion to particular psalms, treated in the writer's disser- tation-on pp. 177-78, 187-95 (#9), pp. 202-3, 212-22 (#22) and pp. 231-32, 239-47 (#31)-shall be dealt with in a later study.

My God, on the day of danger, my soul yearned / for Your help, which restores the soul. 36. You saw how my leg and hand were slipping, / death mingling with my life.</page><page sequence="35">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 199 37. And You rose up to cut down my foe with Your voice, for / with Your voice the flame of foemen is cut down. 38. You hauled him to slaughter like a lamb / thick and fatted on a festive day. 39. And set my portion of his flesh / cheeks and shoulder and maw. 40. To God, who filled his land with desolation / and filled my land with fruitage, 41. And who sated my mouth with good things and renewed / my youth and my prime like an eagle's, 42. And sated with His salvation my soul, / which had been hungry for His salvation- 43. I wondrously produce this hymned speech which shall be / sweet on the lips like the song of David, 44. Carven from pearls of speech / and chiseled from the rock of golden utterance, 45. Decked in garb of words and matter / like the corners of a trimmed palace. 46. When it is declaimed [lit.: lifted aloft] the people shall rejoice / and the wasteland shall exult and blossom like the rose. 47. It shall be moist, when drought and heat consume the waters / of the heavens, when rains are shut up. 48. And it shall illumine those who go on paths by night / and gladden every pining soul. 49. And it shall yet be sung in the midst of God's meeting places / and beneath the canopy of the beloved bride, 50. And shall yet be set in the mouths of the redeemed, ascending / to Zion upon the path.</page><page sequence="36">200 DAVID SEGAL ADDENDUM E "Shall I Stem the Streams of My Eyes?" "Ha-'e'egor nahalei 'einai" 1. Shall I stem the streams of my eyes and shall I rest / when the sons of Hamath [Arameans-Christians] have taken possession of Hamath and Janoah [Levitical cities]? 2. Gebal [Edom-Christendom] dwells within Zion's borders and within the Temple of the apparition of the brightness of / the divine Presence- while the daughter of Zion is driven away. 3. Her husband regards her as a divorced wife, put away / without a bill of divorcement and forgotten. 4. What has life for me with no ark nor ark cover, / nor the splendor of the candelabrum, flowering with almond-blossomed shapes? 5. The Temple and its porches and the most holy place- / a strange fire is within it and the holy fire is removed, 6. And [removed] the magnificence of the bases and capitals and palm / trees resembling pomegranates, they being ninety-six on the outside. 7. I sit deprived of sleep, while the uncircumcised of heart sleep well; I groan, take [this] to heart and reflect. 8. I view the heavens over my head and the stars / unfolding like a flower bed with buds, 9. Like flowers colored like cups of wine / most bright, having the fragrance of a spiced bundle of myrrh. 10. Orion as he rests in his chambers by himself looks like a rebellious / and foolish son turning aside from tribe and family, 11. And the Great Bear with her cubs looks like a woman cloaking / her daughters with compassion, and resting in a peaceful habitation. 12. Swiftly and without legs the Pleiades circle the heaven's / compass daily, like a hind despatched. 13. Tirelessly the zodiac runs to and fro while earth / is suspended in the midst of the zodiac without a rope, yet does not sink low. 14. All these [heavenly bodies] are rightly ordered for those who turn from wrong and understand it [the zodiac], / while the congregation of fools are good-heartedly at rest. 15. My son, walk the good path, for there is no good / except upon the good and upright path;</page><page sequence="37">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 201 16. And hear a wonder that God performed on a day /when hateful foes spewed vain talk and incitement. 17. Chieftains and marshalls and rulers were gathered together / princes of hosts and kingdoms, and every governor. 18. We came upon them with a company swift to contend, one / girding it- self of old with firebrands, and flaming; 19. [A company] cursed when hateful foes recalled its deeds, / but praised when kings [our allies] heard of its bravery; 20. Their souls brimming to wreak wrong, / saturating the earth with blood and making it bring forth and blossom. 21. When the contentious company heard their ringing shout it went very badly for them; / hearing their shrieking, they [too] shrieked [in fear]. 22. They had said in their hearts, "I am one, and there is none else besides me!"; / they were as naught upon our coming and were driven away. 23. They were like lions spread out upon the plains; / they went up the mountain like stags and skipped. 24. We said to them, "Is such the deed of a company of men- / that on hearing a report of a[nother] company of men, it flees? 25. "Pray, descend from the ridges until we make / earth boil like a pot with princes' blood; 26. "Come, draw near in battle, souls of the two combatants: / one will cry out and his companion be gladdened. 27. "Come, we will make your wives weep silently and increase / within your tents lacerated women with heads made bald, 28. "Until the regent of all the birds and of all beasts / lets loose a cry to all dwelling in the wastes and flying 29. "To come and lick the blood of nobles' corpses, each head / [marked] with a head wound or lopped off by the edge of the sword; 30. "To make nobles whom we had covered with worms / into a spread, like dung and refuse, 31. "To place chunks-not chunks of lambs-before / every bird in every nest and before every lion-cub in every pit." 32. Men who had become a stench to us-we made a stench / of their skin, they who had been scented and perfumed. 33. We wounded them with deeds and hand lashes, not tongue-lashings- / for [only] the weak-hearted makes bold with his mouth and prates. 34. We drew near and on every side they went up [retreated] but / when we were distant they gored [us] with the rod of the mouth.</page><page sequence="38">202 DAVID SEGAL 35. "Why do you hold forth so loftily and vainly, only / to refrain from contention and rebuke when the truth comes? 36. "Where are the lies you daubed with your mouth? Here / is the battle and there is no substance to your words. 37. "Before your wives you speak a great deal, yet there are wives / who have husbands who refrain from speaking when they come [home]. 38. "Shouters on the mountain top, descend; we will fill / your wives' mouths, [once] filled with laughter with keening and shouting." 39. We thundered with our voices but no voice replied, for / speech is no snare to a bird who has seen the site of the pit. 40. They were shamed and withdrew, filthy and abominable, / more filthy and abominable than any other group. 41. They were disgraced when one said to another, "Where, / then, are your words?" and the latter fell mute, resigned. 42. They withdrew slain, though alive, for there be men / dead of shame- though they be not slain. 43. At times a man who has a hairy beard and thick head of hair / has beard and hair shaven from contempt; 44. At times a man can walk about in good health-but have / his gall cleft with arrows of mockery in the gates. 45. Their souls were brimming with grief from covering their heads but / I, with head up, was glad and exultant. 46. This is the end of a community that declaimed but did not perform; / this is the end of a community that rode and prospered. 47. This is the last of a nation, their spirit fled; and this was the last / of [some of our] men who regarded death like life and ease [who died wil- lingly]. 48. Thusly every violator of a covenant shall withdraw by day [openly] / for they rejected what was statute, they forgot and abandoned law. 49. Lo, my tongue is a sharp sword: to Him who so rewards / my soul I now begin to sing. 50. I begin and close with praise for the God of deliverance over / cups of deliverance that I give [others]* and take [myself]* 51. Over the deliverance that was sweet and pleasant, / superior to every deliverance of mortal men. *Jarden's explanation, DSH, p. 107.</page><page sequence="39">THREE WAR POEMS OF SHMUEL HA-NAGID 203 52. Had it not been for God supporting my spirit / it had flown, had fled for very excess of joy and gladness. 53. I declaim, I prosper in my song, for my path [of conduct] / steadied my legs and prospered- them on the day of battle. 54. I take to heart how God performs wonders for me daily- / I observe, I look well. 55. And even as I am saved daily in east and west / so I shall laud Your hand in east and west; 56. And songs [lit.: daughters of song] for the mouths of sons and daughters, to / north and south, in the hand of singers, I shall despatch.</page></plain_text>
