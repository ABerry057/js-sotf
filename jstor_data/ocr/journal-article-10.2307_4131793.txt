Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. x, 314 pp. With America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism, Gulie Ne'eman Arad has placed the American Jewish response to the rise of Nazism within its political and social context, thereby making an important contribution to the growing literature that seeks to historicize America's relationship to the Holocaust. At first glance, the book seems to exonerate American Jews from the charge that they did not do enough to save European Jewry. In her tightly argued introduction, Arad offers a corrective to some of the commonplace assumptions about the American Jewish reaction to Hitler. She challenges, for example, as- sumptions that "exceptional circumstances will elicit exceptional responses" (p. 3), and that responses should be measured by the extent of the victims' needs rather than by the bystanders' means to intervene effectively. She argues that crit- ics of American Jewry have ignored the political context that severely limited its ability to act. In the end, however, American Jewry does not come across particularly well in Arad's rendering. For the most part she agrees that Jewish leaders failed to re- act appropriately to the growing crisis, but that the untenable condition of modern Diaspora Jewry made it impossible for them to do so. American Jewry is thus guilty as charged of inaction, but must be excused because of its inherent disability. 153</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews In order to understand American Jews' actions in the 1930s, Arad argues, it is necessary to understand their political history going back to the 1840s. Begin- ning with the Damascus Affair, she concentrates on instances in which American Jews attempted to influence U.S. foreign policy, rightly pointing out the limits of ethnic group power. Most importantly, while the United States always willingly ac- cepted members of white minority groups into the polity as individuals, it was gen- erally hostile to group claims. Arad sometimes overstates her case. She portrays the Jewish experience in America as an ordeal of persistent anti-Semitism. She argues that Jew-hatred first cropped up in the mid-nineteenth century and grew steadily stronger from then on. By the interwar period American Jews were in no shape to react effectively to events in Germany. Not only was the community in a "profound mood of disar- ray" (p. 72) at the end of World War I, but the condition of "statelessness" had had a "profound effect" on the "collective Jewish psyche" (p. 58), inducing an attitude of deference toward the state and a fetish for citizenship. Because American Jews recognized their own precarious position as citizens, they were seldom willing to rock the boat. Because they had internalized many anti-Semitic stereotypes, they were afraid to engage in activities that seemed to bear out those stereotypes. But if "for many American Jews, the first thirty years of the century were the painful unraveling of a dream" (p. 69), things only got worse in the 1930s. Not surprisingly, the American Jewish response to the rise of Nazism was insufficient. For a variety of reasons, communal leaders at first downplayed the threat posed by Hitler. When events in Germany finally made American Jews face up to their own illusions, some turned to Zionism, and others to despair, but most chose to emphasize the principle of universalism. Arad argues that, ironically, the presence of unprecedented numbers of Jews in influential positions within the Roosevelt administration contributed not to Jewish power, but to the cooptation of the Jewish leadership. By the late 1930s, after a series of unsuccessful struggles over immigration policy, Jews were in a "state of existential turmoil" and their leaders were "paralyzed" with fear over the "terrifying" mood in the country (pp. 203, 205). In any case, Arad argues, there was little that American Jews could really do to help their European counterparts. The unfortunate truth was that they were right to see the unhelpful Roosevelt as their only political hope. America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism focuses primarily on a relatively small cohort of important communal leaders in the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congress (mainly Stephen Wise), as well as on Jewish advisors to the president like Felix Frankfurter and Louis D. Brandeis. She seldom discusses Jewish mass politics, except as it occasionally served to pressure Rabbi Wise to take more vigorous action. Indeed, there is little discussion of the public actions that American Jews did take. Frequent mass rallies in Madison Square Gar- den, for example, are mentioned mainly for the anxiety that they elicited in some sectors of the Jewish community. Gulie Ne'eman Arad has made an important contribution by opening the dis- cussion of how the prewar political and social context influenced the American Jewish response to the rise of Nazism. Arad is right that the vastly changed ethnic political climate of recent decades provides a faulty lens through which to view 154</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the actions of the prewar generation.
