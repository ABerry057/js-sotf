Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2007. xv, 400 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001402 "Let my people go" became the motto for the American Jewish movement calling on the Soviet Union to open its borders and allow Soviet Jewish emigra tion. As Henry Feingold writes in this detailed historical account of this move ment, in the years 1967 to 1989, American activists saw themselves as "rescuing" Soviet Jewry from the tyranny and oppression of the Soviet Union. What is more, according to Feingold, the "Free Soviet Jewry" movement was one of the most successful forms of Jewish communal activism in modern Amer ican Jewish history, because it eventually got what it wanted. Feingold 's study begins with the history of American Jews' and the Amer ican government's relationship to Russia and Russian Jewry. Starting in the late nineteenth century, American Jews had been observing the treatment of Russian Jews and intervened on their behalf with their own government and, at times, with foreign governments. The 1903 Kishinev pogrom, the most violent one to have occurred for many years, sparked the 1906 founding of the American Jewish Committee, an organization that has lobbied governments on global Jewish issues, including Soviet Jewish emigration, ever since. American Jews lobbied the U.S. and Russian governments up until World War I and after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, and they worked with the Soviet government to improve the socioeconomic condition of Soviet Jews in the 1920s and 1930s. Within the Soviet Union, Feingold shows, the rapid urbanization and inte gration of Soviet Jews in the 1920s and 1930s was spoiled by World War II and the postwar and post-Holocaust marginalization of Jews in Soviet society. The government silenced public conversation about the Holocaust and limited Jews' continued access to education and social mobility. This gap between Jews' socio economic integration and their postwar marginalization planted the seeds of the Soviet Jewish emigration movement. In 1948, the stakes of Soviet Jewry changed dramatically with the founding of the state of Israel, an event that proved decisive in the global response to Soviet Jewry's situation. Israel was founded on the belief that Jews needed to "ingather" in their "historic homeland," and its very raison d'?tre depended on Jews moving there. Feingold argues that Israeli policy makers constantly eyed Soviet Jewry as a potential future fount of "human material" to build the state from its early contacts with Soviet Jewry in the 1950s to the consistent pressure applied to directing Soviet Jewish ?migr?s to Israel and away from everywhere else, primarily the United States. On the American side, Jewish activists began getting involved in domestic Soviet issues related to Jews in the early 1970s, following on the heels of the breakdown of the civil rights movement into more ethnically driven and radica lized politics. Feingold also argues that American Jews were driven out of guilt 448</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews at not having intervened more vociferously during the Holocaust and were not about to make the same mistake twice. But American Jews had no actual power to change international policy. They relied on the U.S. government's intervention on their behalf. Conveniently, the U.S. government was also deeply embroiled in the Cold War, along with the Vietnam quagmire, negotiations about nuclear war heads and defense systems, and potential global "hot wars" in places such as Afghanistan and Angola. American Jewish activism and Cold War politics dove tailed to put Soviet Jews into the public consciousness. The book's strengths are its careful examinations of American policy making and American Jewish activism on behalf of Soviet Jewry. An entire chapter is devoted to debates about the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 trade bill that, according to Feingold, "was the first piece of human rights legis lation passed by Congress aimed at ameliorating the condition of an oppressed foreign minority" (146). The amendment tied the granting of most favored nation trading status to human rights in a given country, but it directly targeted the Soviet government's reluctance to grant Soviet Jews the right to emigrate. Feingold also describes the internal debates among the establishment Jews of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, the grassroots Jews of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jewry, and the radical Jewish Defense League, which resorted to near-terror tactics on behalf of Soviet Jewry. At the same time, Feingold demonstrates that the Israeli approach to Soviet Jewry differed sharply from the American one. The first demanded emigration from the Soviet government and subsequent immigration to Israel in order to build the state. The American approach, a more civil rights-oriented form of global activism, called for the rights of Jews to freely immigrate to wherever they wanted and for Jews to practice Judaism more freely in the Soviet Union. In the end, although hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews came to the United States in the years 1967-89, the Israeli approach won the day. Most Amer ican Jews continued to focus on emigration at the expense of encouraging civil liberties and supporting Jewish life in the Soviet Union. And with the end of the Cold War, in 1989 the American government changed its liberal refugee policy closing the door to most Soviet Jews. Most 1990s ?migr?s ended up in Israel. Feingold's story ends in 1989, when the Soviet Union began to fall apart, emigration opened up, and the "Free Soviet Jewry" movement was deemed a success. As a historian of American Jewry, Feingold naturally focuses on American Jewish activism, especially those of the major Jewish institutions. The book's sub title is "Saving the Jews of Russia, The American Jewish Effort, 1967-1989." There are no pretensions to being a comprehensive examination of Soviet Jewish emigration. Feingold is also very careful to distinguish between hyped up rhetoric about "saving" and "rescuing" a group of people who, some thought, did not really need saving or rescuing and the reality of the situation for Soviet Jews. The focus on American Jewish activism, while simultaneously trying to tell the story of a three-way conversation among Soviet, American, and Israeli Jews, forces Feingold to make sweeping and unsubstantiated claims about the other two 449</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews global parties. He has little to say about Soviet Jews themselves and, although Feingold dedicates the book to those trying to leave the Soviet Union, they still come across as relatively silent and in need of American Jewish paternalism. On the question of Israel's role, Feingold does not have many kind things to say. In his chapter on "dropouts," those who had Israeli migration visas but decided not to go to Israel and instead "drop out" in the Vienna or Rome transit points and go to the United States, he boldly states, "The dropouts were a bold faced negation of the idea that the Jewish people could reclaim their history in their ancient land after thousands of years of exile" (246). This may very well be true, but Feingold provides no evidence of the fact. Moreover, unlike his very careful teasing out of the multiple voices of American Jewish activism, Fein gold never suggests that there may have been multiple voices shaping Israeli policy making. This lack of nuance for understanding Israeli activism on behalf of Soviet Jewry leaves the historian wanting more. The final problem with the book is one of poor editing. In addition to typos, there are several rather glaring historical errors, primarily on issues of Soviet Jewish history, and each chapter jumps around in time, from the 1960s to the 1980s and back, making it difficult to piece together what historians like to know ?cause and effect. Despite these shortcomings, Feingold has done a careful and thoughtful job of showing the intricacies of the American Jewish movement and con vincingly shows that it took both the Cold War intervention of the U.S. government and American Jewish activism to put Soviet Jews on the global stage. Now we await the same work to be done on the Israeli and Soviet sides of the issue. David Shneer University of Denver Denver, Colorado</page></plain_text>
