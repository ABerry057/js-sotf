<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN SEARCH OF THE "BOOK OF FIGURES": MEDICINE AND ASTROLOGY IN MONTPELLIER AT THE TURN OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY by JOSEPH SHATZMILLER The exchange of letters between Abba Mari of Montpellier (fl. 1300) and Rabbi Solomon Ibn Adret of Barcelona (ca. 1235-1310), collected in the book Minhat qena'ot [Zealous Offering], opens with a controversy over medical astrology.' While the outcome of this controversy, the ban issued in the summer of 1305 in Barcelona against premature study of philosophy, constitutes a well-known event in Jewish history, it is not at all that clear why Abba Mari chose to attack his adversaries, the students of philosophy, by raising the issue of their alleged medical-astrological practices. The data in his first letters to Ibn Adret hint at what might have been the extent of these practices in Montpellier of 1300 as well as who the personalities that he had in mind might have been. From the very first letter we learn that at the 1. Abba Mari Moses bar Joseph, Sefer Minbat qena'ot (Pressburg, 1838). There is no trans- lation of the letters into any European language. However, in Ernest Renan and Adolph Neubauer, Les Rabbins francais du commencement du quatorziume siecle (Paris, 1877), pp. 647-95, there is a comprehensive summary of each of these letters. On the controversy of 1303-1306, see, among others, Yitzhak Baer, A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, 2 vols.

Making a point of inquiring into the complexities of the issue, Abba Mari soon discovered that the talisman, a figure of a lion "with- out a tongue," was just one of many that medical astrologers tried to put into circulation and that there was actually one for each sign of the zodiac. Each of these talismans was believed to have the power to cure people of one or more specific ailments. In the beginning Abba Mari seemed to have gathered his information merely from hearsay, for he stated in his first letter that he "heard from a certain scholar that there is a special book dealing with these issues."3 Some time later he was able to lay his hands on a copy of "The Book of Figures," "Sefer ha-$urot" in Hebrew, in which descriptions of these talismans were given in detail. In his next exchange of letters with Ibn Adret, Abba Mari therefore started with an assertion which might lead us to believe that he had actually seen the book: "Sir, would that you have seen the [description of the talisman] the way I saw it in the 'Book of Figures.' " However, toward the end of this very letter, he was more hesitant about the immediacy of his knowledge: "Know that I inquired into the book and parts of it reached my hands."4 Thus he now claimed knowledge of only parts of the book. What was this "Book of Figures" and why was it so difficult to find? How was it that even Solomon Ibn Adret, living in the city of Barcelona, the 2. Minhat qena'ot, no. 5, p. 32. Abba Mari reports to Ibn Adret: "All the authorities here ... are inclined to ban [the talisman] including the honorable Master Isaac de Lattes who pro- duced and conceived this figure. He said to us: 'It is true that I made this figure although it is forbidden to do it in my opinion. But what can I do if the great master ...

Why is this "Sefer ha-$urot" not mentioned today in a catalogue of Hebrew manuscripts? Is it possible that the "Book of Figures" is one of these treatises of the Hebrew Middle Ages that was lost with the vicissitudes of time? Supporting such a possibility is Ibn Adret's claim that the offending talisman was no novelty at that time, and that to his knowl- edge none other than Nahmanides (ca. 1194-1270), the great rabbinic master of Gerona, had recourse to it in his own medical practice.5 Even earlier than that, in the middle of the twelfth century, we find no less an authority than Maimonides (ca. 1135-1204) referring to such medical- astrological jalismat in his commentary to the Mishnah (Pesabim 4:9, quoted in Abba Mari's letter to Ibn Adret).6 However, neither Maimonides nor Ibn Adret mentioned the "Book of Figures" explicitly, and they con- tributed nothing toward the discovery of its authorship. As for Abba Mari himself, who developed quite a comprehensive exchange of letters with Ibn Adret after 1303, he seems to have abandoned interest in the "Book of Figures." In any event, there is nothing in his later letters which helps us to identify the work. As will be demonstrated below, my research on this problem has led me to believe that parts of the book we are looking for are to be found in a Hebrew manuscript deposited today in Cambridge, England. Furthermore, it may be demonstrated that a Christian professor in Montpellier University before 1300, a contemporary of Abba Mari and a man who was in contact with the Jewish scholars of the city, was the author of a Latin medical- astrological treatise that bears striking resemblance to the "Book of Figures." Our bibliographical itinerary will bring us also to the court of Alfonso the Learned of Castile in the 1250s where similar works were trans- lated from Spanish into Latin. Jewish and Christian Scholars in Montpellier It is certainly no cause for surprise to discover an exchange of medical information between Christian phyisicians and their Jewish colleagues in Montpellier in 1300. Today we know enough about thirteenth and four- teenth century scholars in southern Europe to realize that Christian men of science of these regions were quite eager to benefit from the achievements of 5.

Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon (ca. 1236-1307), the senior Jewish scholar in Montpellier around 1300, boasted on more than one occasion that "our wisdom and science are known to the Gentiles."'7 As if to support his claim, modern research has recently been able to bring to light several instances in which Jacob ben Machir (known as "Profachius Judaeus" or "Prophach of Marseilles") was involved in such a scientific collaboration. Luke Demaitre of New York, relying on previous findings by George Sarton, Lynn Thorndike, Emmanuel Poulle, Pearl Kibre as well as on his own discoveries, was able to collect no less than six refer- ences showing contacts between Jacob ben Machir and Christian scholars.8 In 1980, Demaitre was able to add yet another, seventh, piece of infor- mation.9 The earliest of the references goes back to 1263, when Jacob ben Machir, with the help of Master John of Brescia, translated from the Arabic into Provenqal and then into Latin the astronomical table known as Saphea. Twenty-five years later, in 1288, Jacob's own Quadrans novus was translated from the Hebrew by Master Armengaud Blaise. A third piece of informa- tion concerned astronomical tables which Ben Machir had drawn around the year 1300 and which were translated into the Latin fairly soon. In about the year 1301, the Hebrew version of Costa ben Luca's Practica sphere solide done by Ben Machir was translated into Latin. This time the translator was Stephanus Arnaldi (also Arlandi) who later became the vice-chancellor of the medical school in 1319. In 1312, Ben Machir's treatise on the phases of the moon was latinized by an unknown master of the university. On another, sixth, occasion Ben Machir was said to have translated with the cooperation of Bernardus Monofordin, a regimen by Avenzoar in 1299 at the request of the physician, Master Petrus de Capistango, a scholar who became the regent of the faculty of medicine in Paris in the early 1330s.'0 The last reference was discovered by Professor Demaitre in a Latin manu- 7.

It describes Jacob ben Machir drawing a concentric map of the celestial sphere at the request of Doctor Bernard Gordon, the famous medical professor at the University of Montpellier at that time. The Latin text reads: "et sic completum est opus nostrum ad peticionem magistri Bernardi de Gordonio doctoris excellentis- simi in arte medicine in Monte Pessulano. Explicit de armillis Profacci."" That so many indications have been reconstructed to date encourages us to indulge in speculation as to how intense these contacts were in reality. Even at this stage of our investigation it is noteworthy that so many of these Christian scholars were connected with the world of the universities. We know, in one way or another, about five of them: the anonymous master of 1312, Stephanus Arnaldi, Petrus de Capistango, Bernard Gordon, and Armengaud Blaise, who, as is well known, studied medicine in Montpellier. Information about the possible connection of the others with the university is not available, although it one day might be retrieved from the archives. In an earlier study, I dealt with a circle of Jewish and non-Jewish scholars that existed around Jacob ben Machir in Montpellier.'2 Unfamiliar then with the work of Demaitre, I dealt mostly with the fascinating career of Armengaud Blaise, who appears to have played a key role in the whole story. A medical writer of some merit, he was very active as a translator from the Hebrew into Latin" in the Montpellier of the last decades of the thirteenth century. Between the years 1284 and 1305 he was involved in translating no fewer than six works, all, it would seem, from the Hebrew. In the preface to his translation of Jacob ben Machir's Quadrans, 4 Armengaud explicitly stated that he achieved it with the personal help of the author "secundum vocem eiusdem," the Occitan language probably having served as intermediary between the Jewish author and the Christian translator. Armengaud's own medical compendium entitled De remediis was translated from the Latin into Hebrew in 1306 or 1307, when he was already serving as 11. Demaitre, Doctor Bernard de Gordon, p. 10. In my opinion, Jacob refers to this col- laboration in his Hebrew introduction stating (Ernest Renan, Les rabbins francais du com- mencement du quatorzieme siecle [Paris 1877], p. 617): 711n nmlr p1~' ,t~ np ,:'i, nw11 St,zzi.

The translator was Estori ha-Parhi (1280-1355?), who in the years that followed wrote the famous geographical book Kaftor va-ferah. Happily, Estori mentioned in Kaftor va-ferah that he was a relative, as well as a pupil, of Jacob ben Machir.15 It stands to reason that it was in the context of this Jewish-Christian scholarly exchange and collaboration in Montpellier that was created by Jacob ben Machir that Estori must have come to know Armengaud Blaise. Armengaud Blaise, however, was not the most prominent physician in Montpellier at that time. That title belonged to the illustrious and contro- versial Arnold of Villanova.'6 Arnold, who may have had some fluency in Hebrew as well as some knowledge of Jewish doctrines,17 indeed took part in this exchange of scientific information. His own Regimen sanitatis, also known as the "Arnaldina," was translated into Hebrew in Montpellier dur- ing his lifetime by Jacob ben Machir. It is true that the Hebrew version we have today (MS Escorial G-III-20) was completed only in 1322 well after the death of Arnold.'18 However, we are told by the trans- lator, Crescas Caslari, that fifteen years beforehand an effort had been made to render it into Hebrew. This translation was almost finished in 1306 when the decree of exile from France was promulgated against the Jews of Montpellier. Then, in the confusion, it was lost. This first translation was done, to quote Crescas Caslari, by "the king, the great philosopher .. , who numbered the clouds by his wisdom [cf. Job 38:37], Jacob Ibn Tibbon."'9 Arnold must have also had contact with the Jewish scholarly establish- ment of Montpellier through his own family relationships. As in the case of Jacob ben Machir and Estori ha-Parhi, we discover very close family ties between Arnold and Armengaud Blaise and his brother, Jean. They were his 15.

Later, in the 1320s, Jean estab- lished himself permanently in Marseilles, where he carried on a medical practice coupled with a commercial career. As for Armengaud, he left Montpellier for Barcelona sometime in 1305, where he became the royal physician, a position held also by his notorious uncle. In Barcelona Armen- gaud appears to have continued to maintain his contacts with the Jewish scholars expelled from France, as witnessed by Estori ha-Parhi's translation in 1306 of Blaise's De remediis. There is yet another indication of a possible Arnaldine connection with the Jewish scholarly establishment of Montpellier, which, faint as it is, must still be mentioned at this point: Arnold's "Treatise on Paralysis" was trans- lated into Hebrew while he was serving, in all likelihood, as a professor in the city.21 Nothing of significance is known about the Hebrew translator, a certain Jacob ha-Levi ben Joseph, or Jacob of Ales, with the exception that he was translating medical works from Latin into Hebrew between the years 1297 and 1301 in the Midi, and that his city, Ales, is quite close to Montpel- lier, a little more than seventy kilometers north-northeast. One cannot help wondering whether Jacob of Ales was not also a fringe member of the circle of Jacob ben Machir. We can now understand a report according to which Arnold of Villa- nova made recourse to the talismans in his own medical practice.22 In Anagni in July of 1301, he treated the kidney of none other than Pope Boni- face VIII with a talisman of a lion. "When these things were revealed to me," reported an Aragonese ambassador to this monarch a bit later,23 20.

Heinrich Finke, Aus den Tagen Bonifaz VIII (Munich, 1902), pp. 205-7 and especially the document on pp. xxx and xxxi: "Dixerunt michi etiam aliqui cardinales, cum revelarentur michi predicta, quod papa etiam dixit eis, quod magister Arnaldus modo mense Julii preterito,</page><page sequence="8">390 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER "some cardinals told me that the pope told them that in the last month of July, when the sun was in the sign of Leo, Master Arnold made a certain coin [denarius] together with a belt [bracale], which when he carried it, [the pope] would not suffer from the pain of the stone." The ambassador inti- mated that "the cardinals were quite astonished about the whole thing, about the master who gets involved in such things, and about the pope; how could he publicize such things or even tolerate them?" It is clear then that Abba Mari was not the only one at that time to be indignant concerning the turn the medical profession took: while he reproached the Jewish doctors in Montpellier and specifically Isaac de Lattes, "who produced and conceived this figure," Arnold of Villanova was put on the defensive at Anagni and had to bear the cold looks and indignation of the cardinals. Was there, in the case of the talisman, a link between Arnold of Villa- nova and the Jewish doctors? Nothing either in Arnold's writing or in any of the letters in Minhat qena'ot would indicate such a possibility. However, we now know enough about Armengaud Blaise to suggest that he could have served as an intermediary between the two camps. Moreover, we know for certain that Armengaud's brother, Master Jean Blaise, who was so close to Arnold, made recourse to these talismans on more than one occasion; in the inventory of his goods prepared in Marseilles in the 1320s eighteen talismans made of gold or copper are mentioned.24 "Seven impressions of a lion impressed in gold and eleven in copper which help against the pains of the kidney, especially those of gold," states Jean in the inventory which he wrote in his own hand and which can be seen today in the Archives de la Ville de Marseille (MS 9 ii 187, fols. 4v-5r). We thus establish that parallel to the Villanova-Blaise and Jacob ben Machir line of transmission of translations of medical and astronomical works, a similar pattern can be discerned in terms of making use of these medical-astrological talismans. From the fact dum sol esset in signo Leonis, fecit quendam denarium et quoddam bracale pape, que cum portaretur malum lapidis amodo non sentiret. De quo dicti cardinales valde mirati fueruntum turn de magistro, qui se talibus immiscebat, et de papa, quomodo poterat talia publicare vel etiam sustinere." 24. See the text in Bruno Delmas's "M6dailles astrologiques," (note 22 above), pp. 450-5 1, note 45. The Provenqal text reads: ". . e VII emprecios de leon empremadas en aur, e XI en coire que valon contra dolor de ronhon, majormen aquelas de l'aur" (fol. 5r). Jean Blaise adds: "et d'aquestas enprecions ieu porte alcunas a la fibla del braier et alcunas ves totas," which Pierre Paul translates: "et de ces m6dailles moi-m6me, j'en porte quelques unes ai l'6pingle de la ceinture [du calqon]."

Moreover, it might even have been idiosyncratic to the small Jewish-Christian "community" of scholars in Montpellier around the year 1300. Sigilla Magistri Arnaldi and "The Book of Figures" Could Arnold of Villanova be the author of the "Book of Figures"? The notion that Arnold was in contact with the Jewish scholarly establishment of Montpellier around 1300, together with the information about his involve- ment with the Leo talisman, raises the question of whether he might not have been the author of the "Book of Figures," especially since there exists among the Arnaldine works one that might fulfill the requirements, a trea- tise by the name of Sigilla magistri Arnaldi or De sigillis. Although the author of these short pieces of some 1300 words in all is not absolutely established in the Arnaldine canon, there is no compelling reason for its exclusion from the corpus of his writing.25 Examining its structure and con- tent, one notices that each of the twelve signs of the zodiac is treated separ- ately, and that paragraphs only occasionally exceed the length of one hundred words. Each paragraph starts with a very short statement concern- ing the form of the invariably round medal and the materials, gold or silver, of which it should be made. An indication is also given briefly as to the astrological constellation in which the medal must be engraved. Then comes a rather detailed benediction that must be recited upon that occasion, together with very specific instructions concerning the inscription that should be engraved on both sides of the coin, inscriptions which, in some cases, include Hebrew and Greek words. Naturally, each medal bore the picture of the zodiacal sign. The Arnaldine paragraph then concludes with a list of ailments that may be cured, as well as indications for some other uses of the medal. Quantitatively speaking, most of Arnold's attention was given to the benediction to be recited, as well as to the inscription to be inscribed on the medal. Very little, on the other hand, was said about the various 25. See note 7 above. The De sigillis is published in many sixteenth century editions of Arnold's Opera. The Robarts Library in Toronto has the Basel edition of 1585, where it is found on pp. 2037-42.

Also, Arnold was quite sparing when describing the images that were to be depict- ed on each of the medals. Thus, the paragraph "Leo" says simply "sculpa- tur in Leone forma leonis" with no further mention of the specification "without tongue," one so integral to our Hebrew description of the talisman. A comparison of the Hebrew report of the talisman of Minhat qena'ot and the text of Arnold's Sigilla reveals that Abba Mari does not mention the incantations, recitations, and inscriptions of Arnold at all, but this might be explained by the fragmentary nature or brevity of his statement. After all, he merely reported what he heard or saw and did not intend a faithful trans- lation of any portion of the book. More disturbing is the question of what is to be made of some elements that Minhat qena'ot does contain which are not to be found in the Arnaldine treatise. Abba Mari insists, for example, that the medal must be executed perfectly; he agrees it should be made of gold, but insists it will have a much better effect-in the case of Leo-if fumigated through mastic. Nothing like this is recorded in the Sigilla. Minhat qena'ot, furthermore, distinguishes between an ailment of the right kidney and that of the left kidney; finally Minhat qena'ot had the engraving of "a woman riding on a lion," on the talisman, while no woman is mentioned in the Arnaldine treatise. Given this obvious lack of agreement between the Hebrew report and the Arnaldine treatise, one cannot identify the anony- mous "Book of Figures" with the Arnaldine Sigilla. Although, as we have seen, Arnold and his Jewish colleagues had recourse to similar talismans in their medical-astrological practices, they must have used different coin motifs. Bernard Gordon and his Tractatus ad faciendum sigilla Could Bernard Gordon have been the author of the book we are seek- ing? He too was in Montpellier around this time, he too was committed to medical astrology, and he too collaborated with Jacob ben Machir on at least one occasion. Bernard's career was not as spectacular and breathtaking as that of Arnold; instead of spreading his activity in foreign countries in the courts of kings and popes, Bernard appears to have identified himself totally with the faculty of medicine at Montpellier, and acquired his reputation through his teaching there and through the many scholarly books and com- pendia he wrote. Among his dozen-odd medical treatises, there is one, still</page><page sequence="11">THE "BOOK OF FIGURES" 393 in manuscript in Vienna and Wiesbaden, entitled Tractatus magistri Bernardi di Gordonio ad faciendum sigilla et ymagines contra infirmitates diversas, which deals, as the title indicates, with the making of medical talismans.26 The author of the Tractatus was not content with one talisman for each sign of the zodiac, but, with the exception of Taurus, described two or even in the case of Scorpio, Leo and Virgo, three versions. As one might expect, the Tractatus also indicated in each case the specific diseases that the individual talisman would cure. Because the Tractatus has not yet been published nor made the subject of any systematic study, very little is known about its date of composition (sometime in the first quarter of the fourteenth century), its dependence on other Gordonian works, and its immediate or remote sources. We may nonetheless observe that, unlike Arnold, Bernard was very much preoccu- pied with the time of day and with the astrological conditions under which these talismans were to have been made. The impression of the talisman of Aries, to turn to the first of the twelve, which was supposed to cure maladies of the head, had to be made (Vienna MS Cod. Vidob. 3162, fol. 239r): "Sole existente in prima facie. Et caveatur cum sit impressio quod luna sit crescens et precedat solem ad minus 7 gradibus, hec dicunt sapientes Indi. Et Saturnus et Mars non sint retrogradi et Venus sit in Aquario vel in Scor- pione. Et si sit in Thauro optimum est quia est domus sua. Et si Jupiter sit cum Sole optimum est. Et sit Sol super orizontem non in domo 4ta vel 8va. Et fiat in die solis vel Jovis 2a hora." The talisman Libra (ibid., fol. 240r), to pick just another case at random, dealt mostly with ailments of the stomach. While, according to Bernard, it could be made of any kind of metal, much attention and care had to be given to celestial conditions: "Sole in Libra existente in prima facie ipsius, et non sit Venus retrograda, et Luna sit in augmento. Et si sit in Libra erit valde bonum. Fiat quoque in die et hora solis et non tamen aliter quam percuti- endo." Similarly, precise specifications were spelled out repeatedly for each sign of the zodiac. It is to be recalled also that Abba Mari reported that "Sefer ha-Surot" insisted as well on "many" astrological conditions. What then of the possibility that this Bernardine Tractatus is the "Book 26. See Luke Demaitre, Doctor Bernard de Gordon, (note 9 above), p. 181 (item 37) and 194 (item 74).

It reads: "I gathered from one scholar that there exists a certain book [specializing] in these matters, in which the heavenly sphere is divided into forty-eight constellations which are the twelve signs of the zodiac plus twenty-one southern constellations and fifteen northern constel- lations. It is through them that all this sorcery and these figures are derived. [As for these] figures, some are made of special metal, which [the physician] then wraps with a cloth tinted in a particular color and for [which he] then burns incense of myrrh [Hebrew: mor] or through wax."27 Bernard's Tractatus, by comparison, does not mention at all either the forty-eight Ptolemaic constellations nor any calculation of 12 + 21 + 15. Nor is there any mention of wrapping the metal with a cloth or of a particu- lar color in which the textile is dyed. There is, to be sure, in Bernard's text, as we shall immediately see, a procedure for fumigation. However, it was not done with myrrh or wax, as Minbat qena'ot required, but rather with "mastic" or camphor or aloes. Similarly, the Bernardine talisman of Leo was not made of "special metal" in abstract terms but rather of pure gold. It would appear therefore that we are again comparing apples with oranges and dealing with two distinct books. Fortunately, it is known on Abba Mari's own authority that this first report of his was based merely on hear- say and should not be considered his definitive statement on the issue. In any case, things become much more encouraging when we turn to his second report, which, according to his own words, is based on the more immediate contact he by then had with the original: "And here is what I have dis- covered in the 'Book of Figures': That for the sake of sick people [suffering the illness of] the right kidney a figure of a lion should be made, without tongue, in a straight and not deformed way. Also, it has to be made on a sun's day and in its hour. The book states further that nothing supersedes it if the figure is made of gold and fumigated through mastic. For the sick people [suffering the illness of] the left kidney, [a figure] of a woman riding a lion should be made, covered, and [holding] in her hand a stick or a bridle. 27.

Bernard Gordon (Vienna MS Vidob. 3162, fol. 240r) et aliomodo facta, subvenit morbis renis sinistri; fiat figura mulieris equitantis super leonem frenatum tenentis in manu hebenas et avem unam habentem caput involutam. Not only is the major feature of the picture of a woman riding on a lion identical in both cases, but the details of the harness and the sticks which she holds, correspond almost perfectly. It goes without saying that both Abba Mari and Bernard Gordon talk about treatment for the left kidney. Things are not all that symmetrical and perfect, however; that the Hebrew text does not describe a bird with its head covered, as does the Latin text, is just a minor difficulty. Other, more important discrepancies, are dis- covered when a close comparison is carried out. While Abba Mari does not spend more than thirty words on the talisman of Virgo, for Bernard Gor- don, these two and a half lines in the Vienna manuscript constitute just a fraction, some ten percent or so, of the twenty lines that his description con- tains. As a matter of fact, what is described in Minhat qena'ot refers to just one of three figures Bernard cites for Virgo. The last, which the Tractatus presents first, is a "figura mulieris unius vel duarum existentium in navi involute et caput [MS Wiesbaden adds "in"] velo mundo." On top of that, Abba Mari did not mention at all the technical, yet minute, discussion Ber- nard preserved about the various astrological conditions under which the talisman must be made. He omitted it, yet he knew well that the "Book of Figures" contained such discussions, since he stated at the end of this second passage: "There are also various other conditions." A comparison made of the paragraph concerning the sign for Leo ren- ders the limitations of the Hebrew document even more apparent. Although 28. Minhat qena'ot, no. 5, p. 33.

While Bernard allowed the reader to choose among three ver- sions, Abba Mari presented only one, which was to remedy any sickness of the right kidney. Yet, despite these limitations, we are able to discover in the Gordonian text every detail that was known to Abba Mari, as the following juxtaposition indicates: Abba Mari Bernard Gordon (Vienna MS Vidob. 3162, fols. 239v, 240r) 1. For the right kidney a figure should be made of a lion missing its tongue. Also, it has to be made ... in a straight and not a deformed way. 2. Also, it has to be done on a sun's day and in its hour. 3. The book states further that nothing "surpasses" it if the figure is made of gold and fumi- gated through mastic. 1. figuraque leonis subvenit egri- tudini cordis et renis speci- aliter dextri ... vel aliter fiat figura hominis [MS Wies- baden has "leonis"] non torta sed recta sine lingua . .. et hec subvenit morbis reni dextri. 2. .... in die et hora solis vel martis ... 3.

Both Bernard and Abbi Mari insisted that the medal must be the outcome of a perfect technological achievement: "Immaculate" as Abba Mari puts it; "sculpendo vel percutiendo sed uno ictu" as Bernard has it. Bernard also adds in his text a variant of a "figura Leonis [the Vienna MS reads "hominis"] non tortua sed recta sine lingua." The similarity is even more striking once one gets into the fumigation procedure: "The book states further that nothing surpasses it if the figure is made out of gold and fumigated through mastic," claimed Abba Mari. Bernard, who recorded different metals, recommended for the first the fol- lowing procedure: "Dicunt etiam quidam quod mastix pistetur cum vino bullito et pistato imprimatur figura Leonis ... et hec impressio disciperetur in aqua rosis set detur in potu patienti et non patietur in anno." Then he immediately continued to cite what might have been Abba Mari's immedi- ate source of inspiration: "Dicunt etiam quidam quod si ex auro vel argento fiat figura Leonis ... cum horis et conditionibus supradictis suffumigetur quocumque mastice, subvenit habentibus costas fractas." Finally, for the third medal, Bernard mentions briefly the talisman done "cum auro mastici." This talisman was supposed to relieve the patient from pain for a whole year. Given the results of this analysis, it might be said that the resemblance between the Latin and Hebrew data is indeed striking. The textual similarity is just one part of it. What matters no less is the fact that almost everything found in the second Hebrew report in Minhat qena'ot is encountered in the Gordonian Latin text. There can be little doubt therefore that the unknown "Book of Figures" had much in common with Bernard's Tractatus. For all this, it is still not possible to establish a definite identification between the "Book of Figures" and the Tractatus, because the section reproduced by Abba Mari is much too limited. What we also have before us are similarities and resemblances, not explicit citations or unequivocal references. As a possible objection to such a proposed identification, it could be claimed that Bernard's Tractatus is an elaboration on the lost Hebrew book. Equally, one may hypothesize that both Bernard and the anonymous author of "Sefer ha-?urot" relied on a third, common source, a possibility which is not altogether unlikely. An Anonymous Medical-Astrological Hebrew Treatise The suggestion that Bernard's Tractatus was not necessarily the only</page><page sequence="16">398 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER place from which Abba Mari could have learned about these talismans of Virgo and Leo is based on the fact that there existed in the Middle Ages a similar medical-astrological treatise, written in Hebrew, from which all this information could have been easily derived. The only known copy of this text, called "$urot shneim 'asar mazzalot" ["The Figures of the Twelve Constellations"] is to be found today in the library of Cambridge Univer- sity29 on folios 94v-97v of MS Add. 1741. Nowhere does the manuscript reveal the identity of its author or a possible translator, nor is there any indication as to the date of its composition or translation. One may only state, given paleographical considerations, that the copy at Cambridge was written in Italy sometime around the year 1400, which represents, of course, only the latest possible date for its composition. Several considerations would lead me to submit that the date of compo- sition could not have been much earlier than 1300. For although the anony- mous Hebrew author did not identify himself anywhere, he did leave his fingerprints, so to speak, in three recognizable instances. First, when describing the talisman of Virgo and speaking in first person singular, he revealed that his source of information, or inspiration, was the "Book of Figures." He declared that although the "Book of Figures" specified many conditions under which the talisman of Virgo should be made, "I will men- tion only the most essential."30 Thus we have not only a new assurance that this mysterious "Book of Figures" actually existed, but also clarification that what we have in front of us in Cambridge MS Add. 1741 is not a trans- lation of it, but rather is based on it. Second, our anonymous author made reference, albeit indirectly, to the controversy that surrounded the use of this talisman in Jewish circles around 1300. Solomon Ibn Adret, we may recall, displayed a much more liberal attitude than did Abba Mari toward these medical-astrological talismans. He agreed nevertheless that to the extent that incense was a part of the practice, it had to be considered idolatrous and hence condemned and forbidden."3 And yet such incense was required, as 29. A microfilm of it (no. 17496) is deposited at the Institute for Microfilmed Hebrew Man- uscripts at the National Library, Jerusalem.

The requirement appears first in the paragraph concerning the talisman for the sign of Cancer and then again for that of Leo. In the first instance the Hebrew writer added the cautionary and quite confused remark, not to be found in Bernard's Tractatus, that fumigation "is not to be followed according to our belief as it is contrary to religion. It should be communicated to discreet individuals only."32 Now we understand even better why Abba Mari focused on this obvious weakness in the "Book of Figures," and that for his part, the anonymous Hebrew author either antici- pated or even reacted to such a theological attack. The third indication that the Hebrew version gives as to a possible date of its composition is the shortest, yet, in many respects, the most important one. It is found in the same paragraph of "Scorpio" where Bernard referred to a certain "Master Moses" on whose authority he relied. Bernard did not reveal the identity of the man, but contented himself laconically with the statement that what he says is, according to the Vienna MS, "secundum opinionem magistri Moyses."33 The Hebrew version reads in the parallel passage, "according to the opinion of the master, the teacher,"34 signifi- cantly omitting the name Moses. Who was this Master Moses? That we are dealing with a famous, indeed illustrious authority is obvious from the omis- sion of his name in the Hebrew; it may also be surmised from the utmost esteem conveyed by the expression "ha-ray ha-moreh." Few people could qualify for such a distinction; the first name to come to mind is that of Moses Maimonides, but this possibility has to be dismissed immediately, since Maimonides would have nothing to do with astrology and actually expressed ardent opposition to the discipline.35 However, things are different in the case of Moses ben Nahman. For one thing, an expression like "the master, the teacher," could no doubt fit him as well, for he was esteemed in the second half of the thirteenth century as the 32.

Second, we have it on good authority that Nahmanides, who practiced medicine, made use of such medical- astrological talismans: Solomon Ibn Adret tells us about it in that same letter, where he stated that "I heard that my teacher Rabbi Moses ben Nahman would also treat this sickness with the same figure of a lion and did not have any hesitation about it."37 To this statement, which Ibn Adret reiterated on several occasions, we might bring some corroboration from the fact that Hebrew manuscripts in Hamburg, Munich, Oxford and Milan, just to name four,38 contain astrological amulets which are attributed to Nahmanides. Although the question of these amulets has still to be studied, it is obvious that their attribution to Nahmanides is not necessarily gratu- itous, given the testimony of his disciple Ibn Adret. Accepting even tentatively the identification of "Master Moses, the master, the teacher" with the person of Nahmanides still does not provide us with much more than a terminus a quo for the composition of the "$urot shneim 'asar mazzalot," which should be dated sometime around the year 1250. That it existed in its present state in the Cambridge manuscript by the beginning of the 1300s might be deduced with some certainty from a com- parison, in language and context, between the excerpts Abba Mari included in Minbat qena'ot and what it has to say about Leo and Virgo.

On the other hand, I believe that we are entitled to suggest that there existed in Montpellier, in the early 1300s at the latest, a Hebrew version of the "Book of Figures," whatever its original language, and that this Hebrew version, known to Abba Mari, is incor- porated today in the Cambridge manuscript. Turning once again to Bernard's Tractatus, there is little difficulty in dis-</page><page sequence="21">THE "BOOK OF FIGURES" 403 covering overwhelming similarities between it and between "Surot shneim 'asar mazzalot." In the "Scorpio" paragraph, to quote one example, Ber- nard drew the following picture: [fol. 240v] "Vel aliter figura scorpionis est figura corvi vel hominis habentis in manu sua corvum vel hominis equitantis super equum. Enoch tamen scribit quod multo melior est figura hominis habentis corvum in manu sua et hoc probavit experimento." The Hebrew text reads: "There are those who [describe] him as a man riding a horse. Enoch wrote that the best [would be] a man holding in his hand a crow.""39 The Hebrew version then has the following qualification: "However, the sages of India required that Saturn has to be above the earth," while Bernard Gordon has in the parallel place: "Dixerunt tamen sapientes Deodii [de India?] quod Saturnus sit super terram et Jupiter et Venus sub terra." In the case of Libra, to turn to a second example, the Hebrew version insists that "its weight should be of seven grains of medium weight" and describes "a straight man having two balanced balances and at the top of his hand, a bird, which is half black, half white." The Latin text has in this place [fol. 240r] a "figura hominis habentis in manibus suis 2 libras rectas et in capite unius manus navem [for: avem] unam mediam albam et mediam nigram ex quocumque metallo sicut dictum est ad pondus 7 granorum frumenti." Toward the end of the Libra paragraph, the Latin original reads (fol. 240v): "Experimentator quoque qui fecit eam dixit quod debet fieri in principio diei quinti ante diem, love existente super terram non percutiendo sed pingendo et invenit eam mirabilem [MS Wiesbaden adds now: in effectum] Et opinatus est quod causa efficacie istius sit quia Jupiter erat super terram." The Hebrew equivalent reads: "The person who experi- mented discovered when making it once at the beginning [of the five days] that it was extraordinary, that there is no better one than it. In my opinion, it was so because Jupiter was above earth when he did it and it was not day- time. Also he experimented with making [the figure] with finger[s] and not through engraving or striking."40 39.

Prof. Libby Garshowitz kindly checked the readings of this manuscript and made a number of helpful sug- gestions.</page><page sequence="22">404 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER There would be no real difficulty in going over all twelve paragraphs and indicating such resemblances between Bernard's Tractatus and the Hebrew "$urot shneim 'asar mazzalot." Obviously there exists a very close affinity between the two tracts. Yet we are entitled only to affirm their resemblance and similarity and not their perfect correspondence. For, while Bernard offered two or more talismans for all but one sign of the zodiac, the Hebrew treatise omits as a rule the first Gordonian suggestion and offers only the second and third versions. Even there, sentences are not presented in the same order and the Hebrew contains data (especially in its insistence that cloudy days should be avoided) that one cannot find in the Tractatus. This calls for the conclusion that both the Hebrew and Latin texts were relying upon a third, common source. The Picatrix, Bernard Gordon and "Sefer ha-Surot" One such common source might be an appendix to the Latin translation of an eleventh century Arabic treatise on astrological magic called Ghdyat al-hakim (The Aim of the Sage), a treatise falsely attributed to the Andalu- sian scholar al-Majriti (second half of the tenth century) and also known as the Picatrix after the title of its Spanish and Latin translations.41 The Ghayat was rendered from the Arabic into Spanish under the patronage of King Alfonso the Learned of Castile, between the years 1256 and 1258; very soon after, a Latin version was prepared. There is good reason to believe that the translation from Arabic into Spanish was carried out by Judah ben Moses, a well known translator of similar works. Professor David Pingree of Brown University, whose edition of the Latin Picatrix is about to be published and who kindly directed me to the treatise,42 was good enough to send me the sections that deal with medical-astrological talismans (II, 12, 39-51). Com- parison reveals a remarkable resemblance between the Picatrix and the 41. On the Ghdyat al-hakim and the Picatrix see David Pingree's article, "Some of the Sources of the Ghayat al-hakim," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 43 (1980): 1-15 as well as his article "Between the Ghaya and Picatrix I: The Spanish Version," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 44 (1981): 27-56. 42. Prof. Pingree kindly made me aware also of the fact that "there are two fragmentary manuscripts in the Adler collection in New York of a Hebrew translation of the Latin Picatrix; its date and provenance are not as yet established; nor is it known whether it contains the Hermetic treatise at the end of Book II. But it is clearly a possible source for the Hebrew texts."</page><page sequence="23">THE "BOOK OF FIGURES" 405 Hebrew "Surot shneim 'asar mazzalot." The talismans described and the conditions of their use are almost completely similar; the order of phrases in each of the twelve paragraphs is identical. To illustrate this remarkable resemblance I compare the second paragraph in the Picatrix as deciphered by Prof. Pingree with the Hebrew of "Surot shneim 'asar mazzalot." The subject is Taurus. Similar results would be obtained from comparing the other eleven paragraphs. "Surot shneim 'asar mazzalot," fol. 95r Picatrix, II, 12, 41 "nn r nn~i n nv mn Forma eius est posita supra epar et super m~3vni . ' -T9n in omnes eius infirmitates.

It is therefore very tempting to conclude that, with the Ghdyat or the Picatrix, we have finally come close to "Sefer ha-Surot." Admittedly there are minor differences between the two, even in the section concerning Taurus just quoted. Another outstanding discrepancy concerns the talis- mans of Scorpio, and Leo, where the Hebrew text has concluding sections not found in the Latin. Also noticeable is a lack of any hostile reference to fumigation in the Picatrix, a subject about which the Hebrew, as we have seen, was quite sensitive. In the talisman of Scorpio, the reference to "ha- Rav ha-Moreh" is made in the Picatrix to a magister doctrinalis. One won- ders therefore whether Bernard, when writing "Magister Moyse," was not misled to believe that it refers to Maimonides or Nahmanides. Two important questions will have to await further investigation. The first is, of course, whether "$urot shneim 'asar mazzalot" is a translation of</page><page sequence="24">406 JOSEPH SHATZMILLER the Picatrix or the reverse. It is no less intriguing to ask where Bernard got his version of the Picatrix and on what supplementary data he drew for the additional information he conveys. Conclusion The fascination with further conclusive bibliographic research should not distract our attention from the social and human environment that was responsible for such an exchange of scientific, medical-astrological informa- tion. Whether the line of transmission went from Hebrew to the Latin or the other way, one would experience little difficulty in imagining Bernard Gordon collaborating with his Jewish counterparts in Montpellier at the turn of the fourteenth century and coming out with a Tractatus adfaciendum sigilla et ymagines contra infirmitates diversas. What we know now, on the other hand, about simultaneous use of the talisman, and about the manner and extent of scholarly translation of medical astronomical works makes it perfectly possible to envision a physician like Isaac de Lattes, or any other in the circle of Jacob ben Machir, adopting for the use of the Jewish commun- ity the results of experiments approved by a member of the faculty of Montpellier. That around 1301-1303 the talisman of Leo gave trouble to members of both Christian and Jewish communities indicates that these scholars were quick to exchange information. Most of us today would consider this interest in astrology a step back- ward for the University and a setback in the scientific development of the medical profession.43 Indeed, we discover that many fourteenth century con- temporaries shared that opinion. In their defense, these doctors, astron- omers, and astrologers of Montpellier might have claimed, as did Ibn Adret in the first letter to Abba Mari,44 that although the operation of these talis- 43. For a medical explanation of the possible working of the device, see the Hebrew article of David Margalith about Nahmanides as a doctor in his Hakhmei Yisra'el ke-rofe'im, pp. 133-39.

With time, with more experimentation, and with the refinement of methodology, so might their arguments continue, medical and astrological science would be able to explain better the "why," and not be limited only to the "hows" and the "whens." Abba Mari was not interested in this line of argument. His activities in the three years between 1303-1306, as documented by his letters he later collected in Minhat qena'ot, indicated that his real aim was to limit as far as possible the interest in philosophical studies within the Jewish community. For him the talisman pitfall in which Jacob ben Machir and his friends found themselves was just a pretext, a starting point in a strategy that had as an aim the defense of the true Jewish faith. To start by claiming in general terms that philosophy must be equated with heresy was almost an inconceiv- able proposition in the Midi, especially since the Jews there went through such an examination during the first half of the thirteenth century. The prestige that Maimonides, the Tibbonides and so many translators and astronomers enjoyed would make such a straightforward attack a futile one. By that time, far too many Jews earned their living as medical doctors to permit such a discrediting of the rationalistic tradition to take place. However, to reveal that the new medical practices in Montpellier involved strange "Babylonian" astrological practices and especially procedures of fumigation, using incense, was another thing altogether. In that case the confrontation was not on the level of principles and generalities, but on the level of legal technicalities, with Abba Mari trying to expose transgressions in religious practices. In terms of Jewish religious thinking this seemed therefore to be quite a promising line of attack. Nevertheless, it did not have enough momentum in it to carry Abba Mari all through the controversy, and he had to come back in the ensuing three years with fresh ideas and new data to keep the fire burning. Still, the talisman predicament was sufficient pretext to start a controversy. Department of History University of Toronto Toronto, Canada M5S IAI</page></plain_text>
