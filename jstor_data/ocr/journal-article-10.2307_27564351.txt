Portland, OR: Valentine Mitchell, 2004. xviii, 276 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001207 The history of interwar Polish Jewry has attracted the attention of a growing number of scholars in recent years. Scholarly conferences and journals such as Polin and Gal-Ed have stimulated exciting work on a large variety of subjects. One result of this recent work has been a tendency to take a more nuanced view of the overall position of Polish Jewry between 1918 and 1939. There is little argument that the large Jewish minority in interwar Poland faced a reality that fell far short of the legal and civic equality promised by the Polish constitution of 1921. Even in the best of circumstances, it would not have been a simple matter to reconcile the inevitable tension between the idea of an ethnic nation-state and the model of a democracy that treated all citizens equally regardless of ethnicity or religion. Poles, euphoric over their reborn state, had little patience for those who preferred a multinational republic, especially because two of the largest minorities?the Germans and the Ukrainians?did not accept the legitimacy of Poland's new frontiers. And the Jews, who represented about 10 percent of the population and a large proportion of Poland's urban residents, also failed to find a warm welcome in the new Polish republic. Even had objective conditions been better, Polish-Jewish tensions would have been hard to overcome. But the chances for Polish-Jewish harmony were hardly propitious to begin with. Polish-Jewish relations had been deteriorating since long before World War I. A key movement in modern Polish politics, Roman Dmowski's 9. Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f?r j?dische Theologie 4 (1839): 40. 217</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews National Democracy, saw Jews as alien interlopers who blocked the formation of a healthy Polish middle class. For Dmowski, a Pole was a Catholic; a Polish-speaking, acculturated Jew was still an outsider. To make matters worse, Poland regained its independence in the aftermath of a destructive world war that left the country shattered and impoverished. For much of Europe, war ended in 1918; the Poles fought on all their frontiers long after that, with the Polish-Soviet War concluded only in 1921. And though pogroms perpetrated by Poles were far less frequent than anti-Jewish violence in Ukraine during this chaotic period, anti-Jewish violence in Lvov, Vilna, Pinsk, and other cities embittered many Jews against the new state. Yet despite everything, the overwhelming majority of Polish Jewry felt loyal to the Polish state. Many had fought for Polish independence. Many, embittered and disappointed by Polish antisemitism, still nurtured the hope that the real Poland, the Poland of Mickiewicz and Lelewel, the Poland that defined itself as a beacon of liberty and humanity, would ultimately reemerge. One of the most significant developments of the interwar period was that even as assimilation all but collapsed as a political ideology, acculturation pro ceeded at a rapid pace. Unlike the period of 1860-90, when many Jews dreamed that they could become "Poles of the Mosaic persuasion," and when many Poles were willing to accept them as such, by 1918, very few Poles or Jews were ready to argue that one could be a Pole and a Jew at the same time. But even as the ideal of assimilation waned, more and more Jews spoke Polish as their first language. By the 1930s, a large majority of Jewish children were getting their education in Polish-language schools, and very many came to love and cherish Polish culture. There were three daily Jewish newspapers in the Polish language, all of very high quality. This made the growing antisemitism of the period even harder to bear. Sean Martin's study of Jewish Life in Cracow between 1918 and 1939 is a welcome contribution for many reasons. Interwar Polish Jewry was marked by significant regional differences, and good local studies are indispensable for a better understanding of the period. This is an excellent study of an import ant community that had both a high degree of acculturation and a strong sense of Jewish identity. Martin traces the impact of the Habsburg legacy on the social and cultural profile of Cracow Jewry and shows how decades of Polish education created an ethos that sought to combined Jewishness and Polishness. Whereas many scholars in the past have emphasized that the "glass was half empty" and that Polish Jews found themselves in a trap with "no way out," Martin paints a much more nuanced picture. Through schools, public cer emonies, and associational life Jews in Cracow sought to find a place for them selves in a country that they loved and that they hoped would change for the better. Martin's strongest chapters chart this process: "The number and range of Jewish institutions founded in interwar Cracow testifies to the vibrancy and hopes of the community as well as to the need for a separate, protected public space where Jews could feel safe. As late as 1937, Jewish leaders established private Jewish schools with Polish as the language of instruction precisely 218</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews because they envisioned a Polish future in which the Jews would play an active role" (239). Yet Martin makes some mistakes. For example, he confuses Kazimierz, the historic Jewish quarter of Cracow, with Kazimierz Dolny (32). But these quibbles in no way detract from the overall value of the book, which is enhanced by Antony Polonsky's enlightening introduction.
