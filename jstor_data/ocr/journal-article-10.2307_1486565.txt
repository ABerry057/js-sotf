<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gila Ramras-Rauch. Aharon Appelfeld: The Holocaust and Beyond. Bloom- ington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 211 pp. Aharon Appelfeld is a unique voice in contemporary Israel's literary arena. Regarded with both reverence and detachment, Appelfeld has been seen as refusing to let go of the painful memory of Jewish victimization that the Israeli consciousness would rather hold at arm's length. Mainly concerned with European Jews (in Europe and in Israel), Appelfeld has been relegated to a territory outside the existential and geopolitical concerns of his contemporaries in modern Israel. In several interviews he has given to the Hebrew press, Appelfeld has expressed his sense of isolation and marginality on the Israeli literary and cultural scene. At the same time, the Jewish scene that Appelfeld revisits time and again in his works is unlike that of earlier Hebrew writers with European roots, such as S. Y. Agnon and his predecessors. It is not the shtetl Jews that Appelfeld is haunted by, but rather the assimilated, alienated, self-hating Jews of Central Europe. The only prominent writer before Appelfeld who comes to mind as depicting a similar human and mental landscape is the pre-Holocaust David Vogel. Further, while labeled a Holocaust writer, Appelfeld so far has refrained from dealing directly with the explosive horrors of the gas chambers and labor camps. His body of work refutes Theodor Adorno's famous statement that it is impossible to write poetry after Auschwitz ("Man kann nach Auschwitz keine gedichte mehr schreiben"). Avoiding both the technique of grotesque reflection of monstrosity and madness opted for by some, and the blatantly naked naturalism opted for by others, Appelfeld has created a hauntingly stylized world in which the "heart of darkness" itself is never touched. The</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 285 Holocaust is a forbidden territory in Appelfeld's canon; it is viewed from a chronological and geographical distance. His stories focus on the anguished anticipation and tactics of denial before it occurs; the crippling impact it has left behind, in the form of social and mental misfits; or the emotional and spiritual numbness, often coupled with physical muteness, of the traumatized child who wanders or somehow survives for a while outside the actual sphere of horror. In this superbly written, comprehensive study, Gila Ramras-Rauch has made the first significant contribution to the study of Appelfeld in English. Such an endeavor is timely and extremely needed, since Appelfeld is perhaps more popular among the English-reading public than among his own coun- trymen. Ramras-Rauch covers as well those works that have not yet appeared in English translation. Ramras-Rauch's preference for a tale-by-tale examination, rather than a thematically focused presentation, may be due to the introductory nature of this study. This structure is simple but highly effective and makes the book more accessible to the general reader. After a short, informative biographical sketch, Ramras discusses the major features of Appelfeld's literary techniques and aesthetic underpinnings which make his works so different from those of his Israeli contemporaries. The author remarks on the absence of what Harold Fisch has called the "historic archetypes," such as the reverberative themes of the Aqedah or Qiddush HaShem. In stylistic and thematic texture, then, as well as in the cultural ambiance of his protagonists, Appelfeld marks the theme of Jewish alienation. Ramras-Rauch's study then follows Appelfeld's works, collections of stories, novellas and novels, according to their chronological sequence. Interestingly, his first collection of short stories manifests the aesthetic maturity and defines the cultural territory of subsequent works. In her minute, insightful analyses of the individual works, Ramras-Rauch often points out influences of or affinities with other European and Jewish-European writers. In "Afterword," she assesses Appelfeld's ambivalence toward assimilated Jews, and considers his status as a Jewish writer who comes from a background of self-hatred and defection. The analyses of the individual stories are very perceptive, making Ap- pelfeld's deceptively simple narratives fascinating, subtle, and meaningful to the sophisticated general reader. Since the Appelfeld phenomenon is still a work-in-process, the definite assessment of it will have to wait for a later date. Many aspects of Appelfeld's works that critics have found controversial or</page><page sequence="3">286 BOOK REVIEWS disturbing, which Ramras-Rauch notes and discusses briefly in her last chapter (such as the absence of a single point of view and of a cry for revenge), will have to be placed within the larger context of Hebraic literature. Furthermore, since the completion of this study, Appelfeld has published several more novels in which he has broadened his thematic and historical reach. In some he has departed from his more prevalent time frame which covers events leading to the Holocaust or overcast by it. Unto the Soul (published in English in 1994) and Until the Dawn 's Light (not yet translated) end before World War 1, while Abyss (not yet translated) deals more closely with the phenomenon of conversion. One would hope that as Appelfeld's works continue to flow, Ramras-Rauch will augment her study and have a better perspective from which to more clearly delineate and define Appelfeld's unique place in contemporary fiction.
