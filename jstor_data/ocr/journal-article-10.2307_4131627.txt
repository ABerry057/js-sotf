Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. viii, 248 pp. A feast for the imagination, Krutikov's Yiddish Fiction and the Crisis of Modernity is best begun with dessert; the last chapter of this richly observed, orig- inal study of the modernist turn in Yiddish prose fiction repays with interest the reader's diligent investment in the first three-quarters of the book. Here, Krutikov not only offers the most concise and compelling version of his argument but also resolves some of the questions that bedevil his attempt to determine the role of lit- erature in history. The problem is, of course, not his alone but of paramount im- portance for every student of Eastern European Jewish culture. Krutikov's diachronic reading of a single historical moment through the prism of fiction thus offers an immediate point of entry into the gap between the reality of Jewish lives in history and the construction of Jewish life in literature. Krutikov argues that the floodtide of cataclysmic changes-violence, eco- nomic dislocation, immigration, radical politics-that overwhelmed Jewish soci- ety in the wake of the 1905 revolution altered the course of Yiddish writing. While the so-called classics of modern Yiddish letters-the works of Sholem-aleichem, Sh. J. Abramovich (known by the name of his fictional persona, Mendele the Bookpeddler) and I. L. Peretz-achieved almost canonical status, a younger co- hort of writers both in both Russia and America strove toward the creation of a new narrative paradigm. All three, according to Krutikov, based their Jewish fictions on the principled use of repetition in the name of desire to return to a mythical point of origins; overwhelmed by events, they constructed (in the words of David Roskies, invoked by Krutikov) an enduring Jewish "mythology of the mundane" as a way of mitigating catastrophic history. By contrast, Weissenberg, Opatoshu and, most characteristically, Bergelson adopted a more linear, historicist approach to plot and characterization, as well as a style that privileged transformation over stasis, psychology over type, universality over Jewish particularity, and nature over 349</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews culture. Instead of Yiddish novels, which rendered Jewish language as the expres- sive means of Jewish content-ethical, ritual or textual-they experimented with generically indeterminate forms to describe the Yiddish-speaking Jews who occu- pied the same unbounded historical space as their gentile neighbors. Their own commitment to Yiddish derived not from a vision of ecstatic union with their au- dience but from a subtle appreciation of the linguistic--phonetic and semantic- potentialities of the colloquial idiom. Unmoored from Jewish scripture and Jew- ish community, the language of Yiddish modernism became more closely linked with the revolutionary course of the European avant-garde, a movement equally obsessed by its own anxieties of influence. In order to demonstrate the all-important link between modernity and mod- ernism, Krutikov constructs a taxonomy of motifs-the shift from an agrarian to an industrial and commercial economy, the spread of revolutionary politics, im- migration, and the rise of the "new woman"-that appear as a series of "crises" within Jewish society, refracted through the lens of contemporary Yiddish fiction. While Krutikov explicitly acknowledges his debt to his Soviet predecessors in his emphasis on literature as a faithful register of social reality, he is at his best pre- cisely when he strays from the well-trodden path of Marxist historicism. The first three chapters focus on the aesthetic representation of social mobility; this is a tale simply told and expertly put together. The final chapter, "Love and Destiny: The Crisis of Youth" is, in its own modest way, a gem of historical insight into the way literature makes a difference. Linking the expression "crisis" of early-twentieth- century Yiddish literature with an increasing interest in psychological realism that seemed beyond the capacity of its conventions, Krutikov relates the literary quest for subjectivity to the radical transvaluation of gender categories. Krutikov con- trasts the tentative embrace of subversive female interiority in the work of Opatoshu, Asch, and Bergelson with the defense of male authorship in the autobi- ographies of Sholem-aleichem and Peretz. The latter recuperates Jewishness for the modern Jew by promoting the reconciliation between personal desire and col- lective responsibility; the former forecloses any possibility of a qualified return to Jewish society and Jewish tradition. The national mythology of the prodigal son gives way to the incurably diasporic reality of the errant daughter. Krutikov is among a distinguished minority of contemporary Yiddishists ful- ly at home not only in the Jewish vernacular but in the imperial lingua franca. His cosmopolitanism is impressively evident in his command of Russian theoretical literature but not sufficiently so in his reluctance to depart the imaginary confines of Yiddishland for the actual places where Yiddish literature developed alongside its Russian, Polish, and American counterparts. Strained comparisons with British modernism serve only to heighten the absence of local texts and contexts. Was the sense of crisis that Krutikov attributes to Yiddish literature generally symptomatic? After all, the events which occasioned it affected gentiles no less than Jews, not to mention Jews who wrote in languages other than Yiddish. More attention to the comparative cultural manifestations of the forces that engaged the attention of Yiddish authors might have led Krutikov to the proposition that the creation of the "Yiddish literary system" (p. 6) depended-then as now-on the constant re- assertion of crisis as a paradigmatic Jewish condition. In their move toward the sin- 350</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews gular and the idiosyncratic, Krutikov's Yiddish modernists implicitly defied the limits of such historical parochialism. Writing in Yiddish served their efforts to leave Yiddishland behind; Krutikov's fine work leaves one wishing that more Yid- dishists would follow suit.
