Yet professors usually assign the same thinker year in, year out because they continually discover new things in his or her texts. Texts such as these consolidate such a great deal of 482</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews seemingly divergent material and integrate so many apparently dissimilar influences-and do so with such panache-that they create an almost living abun- dance, one with great power to illuminate and reveal. This expansiveness and the insight it affords, however, inevitably face difficulties. Great thinkers seldom express their ideas clearly. Worse still, their creativity threatens the rigid dichotomies that conformism, fear, and ideology use to conceal the wealth of connections and possibilities that abound in real life. Seen in this light, the three books under review form a very welcome and important addition to the growing body of scholar- ship on Emmanuel Levinas, a thinker whose genuine originality not only deepens the vision of his readers but also invites them to rediscover the profound ethical responsibility that constitutes the deepest layer of their selfhood and identity. The two volumes translated by Nidra Poller advance the ongoing effort to render Levinas's writing into clear, helpful English prose. Each also benefits from an introductory essay written specifically for that volume by Richard A. Cohen. Unforeseen History, a collection of Levinas's shorter essays and occasional pieces that first appeared in French in 1994, offers his views on topics ranging from phe- nomenology and existentialism to cold war politics, art, and the relationship between Jewish tradition and modem secularism. It contains several essays that are important for tracing Levinas's intellectual development, including the hard- to-find, prescient essay "Some Thoughts on the Philosophy of Hitlerism" (1934); the noted and, it seems to this writer, decidedly Judaic foray into the philosophy of art, "Reality and Its Shadow" (1948); and several separate responses to Sartre's views on Judaism and antisemitism that still intrigue many today. Cohen's introduction sets the stage for the pieces that follow through an instructive and incisive reflection on the title Levinas gave to this collection. He notes at the outset that, for the most part, Western philosophy, at least well into the late nineteenth century, denies that time in general and human history in par- ticular possess an integral, irreducible reality of their own, one that might really escape or transcend our grasp. According to Cohen, this first changed with Bergson and then with Heidegger. These thinkers discovered that temporality contains truths all its own, including those that exceed cognition. They also render history dynamic and revelatory, endowing the future, in particular, with a radical novelty whose appreciation demands new kinds of receptivity. Yet Cohen observes that Bergson and Heidegger remain committed to what he terms the philosopher's "typical predilection for the neutrality of knowledge." Both thinkers advocate wonder, intuition, and aesthetic appreciation as the best ways to register and incorporate the revelatory future. For Levinas, by contrast, the very transcendence of the future, the endlessly repeated opening up of new moments and unpredictable possibilities, ultimately derives from the otherness and transcendence of the other person. That is to say, we find ourselves "in" a flow of time that constantly exceeds our knowledge and presents us with an "unforeseen future" already indicates that we have been touched in and shaped by interpersonal encounters. The meeting with the other person has "tom us out of ourselves" and opened us to time's undivinable movement onward. In short, as Cohen points out, for Levinas, history and the future are fundamentally ethical matters. We must not merely speculate on what the future means or wax 483</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews eloquent on its mysterious newness-we must accept responsibility for those whom it affects as it runs its unforeseen course. Cohen situates Levinas in opposi- tion both to Western philosophy's traditional view of history and to Bergson's and Heidegger's dynamic yet more-or-less amoral approach to history, and so he pro- vides the intellectual background to the essays on specific historical and political topics in Unforeseen History. Cohen's article-length introduction to Nidra Poller's strong translation of Humanism of the Other goes even further in articulating the unique intellectual territory Levinas has staked out. Humanism of the Other consists of three articles published between 1964 and 1970 that occupy an absolutely crucial place in Levinas's philosophical development. The first of the three, "Signification and Sense" (1964), amounts to a manifesto of Levinas's later thought. It cites and critiques contemporary philosophical views of language, culture, and human experi- ence-including that of Maurice Merleau-Ponty-before introducing Levinas's own position and certain powerful new ideas, such as that of the "trace" (originally introduced a year earlier in an essay that Levinas cut and pasted almost whole into "Signification and Sense"). Given the importance of this volume to Levinas's overall project, Cohen elects in his introduction to go into considerable detail about twentieth-century understandings of the key idea of "humanism" to help readers grasp Levinas's compellingly innovative approach to this idea. Cohen observes that the debate at Davos in 1929 between Ernst Cassirer and Martin Heidegger, which the young Levinas attended as a graduate student, had far more significance for Levinas's thought than scholars had realized. As Cohen brings out with verve and clarity, at this debate, Levinas saw before him a prophe- tic contest between two major paradigms in twentieth-century thought: the older, culture-based humanism of Cassirer, and the new, ontological or existential "anti- humanism" of Heidegger. For Cassirer, human beings determine their own destiny through their linguistic and cultural creativity. The human use of symbols allows us to shape our morality, our society, our laws, and so on; society and culture embody uniquely human achievements. It is therefore up to all of us to celebrate the best in human beings by symbolically expressing this in art, in language, in thought, and so on. Yet for Heidegger, the focus is not on human beings as creators of symbols but rather on being itself, that is, what we can gather about being through the "revelations" that are manifest in the ongoing course of events and happenings that constitute an epoch. In this sense, for Heidegger, human beings are important not so much in themselves but rather because it is in and through them that being comes to be revealed. Cohen evokes well the clash between these two positions, but even more significantly, he shows how Levinas moves beyond them. Levinas ends up far closer to Cassirer, at least in terms of the political implications of this debate. (As Cohen informs us, Levinas could not forgive himself for siding, as a young graduate student, with Heidegger at the time and even sought out Cassirer's widow many years later to ask her pardon for this.) Yet Levinas rejects Cassirer's traditional humanism because, ultimately, its good intentions could not stand up to the evils that were unleashed in Europe in the twentieth century. Levinas also utterly rejects Heidegger's subordination of actual, concrete human beings to 484</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews the faceless and impersonal miasma of being. From these twin rejections, Levinas develops his own "humanism of the other person." As Cohen's introduction to this volume nicely shows, the humanity of this sort of humanism is guaranteed neither by cultural ideals nor by ontology but flows rather from an unremitting ethical responsibility for the other human being. Claire Katz's thoughtful and provocative book Levinas, Judaism, and the Feminine excels at marshalling the philosophical and conceptual resources readers need if they are to appreciate the intriguingly complex and multisided understanding of women and gender that Levinas creates. Both students and scholars of Levinas will be grateful to Katz for her determined refusal to accept simple answers or monolithic resolutions. Again and again, Katz cites commentators on and critics of Levinas's writings on the feminine, including prominent figures such as Simone de Beauvoir, Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and more recently, Tina Chanter-and in each case goes on to demonstrate carefully and patiently what each critic gets right in Levinas and what each critic has overlooked or failed to consider fully in his work. This is hardly to say that Katz uncritically defends Levinas at every turn; rather, she exhibits a rich awareness of the dangers lurking in a number of his formulations. It would be more accurate to say that Katz wants to do justice to the immense wealth and subtlety of Levinas's thinking on the matter of the feminine, and for this reason, she works assiduously to examine all the textual evidence avail- able and to clarify the multitude of different ideas and distinct arguments contained within it. Katz pursues this agenda in a truly unique fashion. In the analyses and reflections found throughout her book, she consistently attends to and integrates four separate factors: (1) the multivalent and transcategorial theme of the feminine itself in Levinas's philosophical writings; (2) the narrative, metaphoric, literary, ethical, and spiritual notions of the feminine that Levinas explores in his Jewish apologetic writings; (3) the phases of Levinas's overall philosophical project and the different, though always essential, role the feminine plays in each phase; and (4) the influence of Jewish tradition in general and certain Judaic texts, ideas, and practices in particular on Levinas. Katz is especially convincing in her use of Judaic materials to show how the meaning of many of Levinas's philosophical claims becomes far clearer when viewed in the context of his Jewish background. This a very welcome and still too infrequent occurrence in the secondary literature on Levinas, despite the urging of figures such as Catherine Chalier and others that we stop segregating Levinas's philosophy from his life, his Judaism, and the world of Judaic textuality that he spent much of his life exploring and teaching. In addition, this more con- nective hermeneutic also adds much-needed nuance to criticisms of Levinas, allowing us to see the truly novel intellectual moves he is making. Of course, far from any sort of apologetics, Katz maintains an even-handed willingness to investigate both sides when it comes to Judaism, summoning up sympathy both for its traditional advocates and for its modern critics. Given the breadth of sources Katz explores, the many dimensions she investigates, and the impressive negative capability she employs in sifting through texts and ideas thoroughly 485</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews before rushing to judgment, her book must be considered the single best volume on this topic so far. After an introduction and an initial chapter that set out the terms of her study, Katz devotes a chapter to Levinas's view of the feminine in early work, such as Existence and the Existent (1947) and Time and the Other (1948), and another to de Beauvoir's famous criticisms thereon and the issues they raise. Katz brings home clearly that, in terms of Levinas's philosophical argumentation, from the very beginning of his career, the feminine and gender more generally simply cannot be "scraped off' as inessential "secondary qualities." In other words, one might think after a superficial glance at Levinas's early texts that the ethical encounter takes place between two human beings in general, whose gender as well as other markers of identity "drop out" in the purified reality of ethics. Certainly, Levinas does sound like this at times: What transpires in ethics is indeed, in one sense, not about anything but a subject confronting the humanity of the other person. Yet Time and the Other marks a fascinating break with philosophical tradition precisely because Levinas appeals to the feminine to articulate the identity of the subject and its difference from the other in such a way as to prevent them from being finally reintegrated into some larger whole. If the feminine plays this sort of deeply constitutive role in Levinas's phi- losophical definition of subjectivity and otherness, then clearly, in some sense, there cannot be ethical meeting without it. After exhibiting this deeply unresolved conception of the feminine in the early work, Katz turns to de Beauvoir. She points out in her analysis of de Beauvoir that assigning to the feminine the role of creating "otherness" turns out to be anything but a straightforward move. On one hand, being cast as "other" has all too often excluded women, marginalized them, or inspired hostility toward them. On the other hand, Levinas's departure from the Western philosophi- cal tradition involves a brand-new celebration of the other, of the nobility and ethical weight of the one who exceeds oneself and transcends the system. In this context, Katz turns to Levinas's reading of the Genesis narratives to flesh out his true understanding of feminine alterity, in the process comparing Levinas with a variety of interpretations ranging from midrash and classical parshanut to contemporary Jewish feminist thinkers such as Judith Plaskow and Rachel Adler. As a consequence, Katz leaves the reader with a much richer sense of the real breadth, nuances, strengths, and weaknesses of Levinas' position. The next three chapters of the book describe the maturation of Levinas's view of the feminine in Totality and Infinity (1961) and the critiques of Irigaray and Derrida. The other who stands in what the Levinas of Totality and Infinity calls the "face to face" relation, and whose otherness pulls me out of my self- enclosed egocentricity and orients me toward other people-this other may indeed transcend qualities such as height or complexion or gender. Yet the work of 1961 continues to argue, in a way that is deeper than and yet still analogous to the work of 1947-48, that the feminine constitutes an essential condition for the subject, the face-to-face relation, and thus ethics itself. In Totality and Infinity, the feminine provides an essential condition of the subject's own being, 486</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews providing the "originary hospitality" that allows the subject to retreat from the world, to be at home, and to enjoy habitation. According to this work, the feminine also opens up the possibility of the erotic relationship, which seems to both pre- suppose the ethical relationship and at the same time "fall below it." Similarly, the feminine allows the subject to come as close as one can to one's own self in the form of the relationship of fecundity. As Katz incisively puts it, these philoso- phical moves lead to an intricate, paradoxical, and yet intriguing situation: The feminine per se (and sexual difference more broadly) is excluded from and yet absolutely essential to the purely ethical moment of face-to-face encounter. Katz displays a keen awareness that this philosophical situation can easily turn into misogynistic subordination. Still, in her analysis of Irigaray in particular, she highlights what Irigaray neglects, namely that Levinas's insistence on articu- lating his philosophical vision from the perspective of a man-far from being an unexamined reflex of patriarchy-in fact testifies to his commitment to asym- metry, to real difference, to the nonidentity and noninterchangeability of self and other, of male and female. Ironically, exactly this can nurture and preserve feminine alterity. The chapters Katz devotes to detailing the danger and the glory of Levinas's view of the feminine in Totality and Infinity are among the best in the book, and they reveal her commitment to the sometimes paradoxical character of real thought. The final chapters of Katz's book offer an unusually hard-hitting and genuine conversation with Levinas's later work and with some of the relevant Judaic materials that helped to shape this work. The later Levinas abandons use of the category of the feminine. He turns instead to a powerful new paradigm to describe ethical responsibility, that of maternality, as in the striking formu- lation in Otherwise than Being (1974) that the "self is pregnant with the other." Levinas focuses here on the profoundly personal and untransferrable nature of ethical responsibility-the other's power, as it were, to claim us from within our very being. Katz argues persuasively that this move represents Levinas's development from a conception of the ethical subject centered on viri- lity to one that emphasizes instead the goodness and potential for self-sacrifice that lie within the maternal. Katz points out, of course, that Levinas is no longer talking about the feminine, and so there is no worry that he might somehow be attempting to define the feminine through maternality. Still, Katz carefully analyzes what Levinas builds into his conception of the maternal. In pursuing this end, she invokes Jewish sources dealing with matriarchs as well. Katz's conclusion is important and promising. She holds that Levinas advocates a matemality with two sides: a side that involves the capacity to sacrifice the self for the other, and a side that can make choices and enjoy life in a fully embodied and erotic way. There can be little doubt that Katz's work will enjoy the blessings of fecundity. Jacob Meskin Hebrew College Boston, Massachusetts 487</page></plain_text>
