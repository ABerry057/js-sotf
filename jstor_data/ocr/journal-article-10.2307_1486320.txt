<plain_text><page sequence="1">AVERROES AND NARBONI ON THE MATERIAL INTELLECT by HERBERT A. DAVIDSON Questions regarding the human intellect haunted Averroes throughout his philosophic career; no less than seven of his preserved works treat the human intellect formally, while others, naturally enough, also do so inciden- tally. Here I shall point out that the seven aforementioned works fall into a sequence, that a recently published text of Averroes' has its place within the sequence, and that Moses Narboni misread Averroes for reasons to be explained. What most baffled Averroes was the nature of the human material, or potential, intellect, that is, the potentiality for intellectal thought with which man is born. Aristotle had posited an intellect in man which is "potential,"' which "before thinking is not any thing actually,"2 but "is what it is by virtue of becoming all things,"3 and which, being "all things potentially," is a kind of "matter."4 Quite apart from the explicit statements, the spirit of Aris- totle's philosophy in any event requires that a potentiality for thought precede actual human thought. Given the existence of a potential or 1. Aristotle, De anima III, 4, 429a, 16. 2. Ibid., 429a, 16. 3. Ibid., 5, 430a, 14-15. 4. Ibid., 430a, 10-11. 175</page><page sequence="2">176 HERBERT A. DAVIDSON material human intellect, its nature remains to be defined. Aristotle indi- cated that the potential or material intellect is of a different character from the other faculties of the human soul, but he failed to state just what its nature is;5 and his vague remarks on the subject have, for twenty-three hundred years, tantalized, more than enlightened, readers. From Averroes' vantage point, the range of possible interpretations was delimited by Alexander of Aphrodisias at the one extreme and Themistius at the other. Alexander had construed the human material intellect as a mere "disposition."6 That is to say, the material intellect is not a distinct entity added and attached to the human organism, but is nothing other than the human organism's being constituted, or disposed, in such a manner that it has the ability to think. Alexander's position is brought out nicely in a nuance he appended to one of Aristotle's analogies. Aristotle had suggested that the human potentiality for thought resembles a blank writing tablet.7 Yet a writing tablet is a substance, whereas Alexander understood the human potentiality for thought to be not a substance but a disposition. Alexander accordingly emended the Aristotelian analogy. The material intellect, he wrote, does not, to be precise, resemble a writing tablet. Rather it corresponds to the "unwritten aspect of the tablet," to the "disposition [in the tablet] for being written upon."8 Just as the writing tablet possesses a capability for receiving writing, the human organism or human soul pos- sesses a capability for receiving thought, and the material intellect is simply that capability. Themistius, by contrast with Alexander, construed the human potential intellect as something "separate" from matter, in other words, as incor- poreal, and hence indestructible.9 The attributes incorporeal and indestruc- tible, Averroes reasoned, can belong only to substances, and he therefore took Themistius to have construed the material intellect as an eternal, incor- poreal substance.' Ibn Baijja, Averroes informs us, also entered the lists; in a variation of Alexander's position, he maintained that the material intellect 5. Ibid., 1, 4, 408b, 18-25; III, 4, 429a, 15-429b, 5. 6.

Averroes thus visualized a field of combat. On one side, Alexander and Ibn Bajja construed the material intellect as a disposition in the human organ- ism or specifically in the imaginative faculty of the soul, while on the other, Themistius construed the material intellect as an eternal incorporeal sub- stance. The texts of Alexander and Themistius were available to Averroes in Arabic translations.'2 The texts of Ibn Bajja which Averroes cites have also been published, but one of them, Ibn Bijja's De anima, breaks off in the middle of the discussion of intellect. None of the published texts of Ibn Bajja construe the material intellect as a disposition."3 Either Ibn Bajja expressly took that stand in the missing part of his De anima or in an unknown work; or else-most probably-Averroes found it implied in other statements of Ibn Bajja's.14 Artificial and simplistic though the scheme might appear, Averroes progressed from one extreme to an intermediate position and then to the other extreme. In the early stages of his thought he accepted the positions of Ibn Bijja and Alexander, subsequently he discovered a compromise be- tween their positions and Themistius', and ultimately he embraced Themis- tius' position. Averroes' Epitome of Aristotle's De anima refutes Themistius and argues at length that the material human intellect must be a disposition in the imaginative faculty."' Some Arabic manuscripts of the Epitome and a medieval Hebrew translation contain interpolations, however, both in the body of the discussion of intellect and at the end.'6 The interpolations in the 11.

And the statement appended at the end announces that the preceding pages represent Ibn Baijja's theories, that Averroes had accepted those theories because Ibn Bajja "misled me," that Averroes now saw matters differently, and his considered position was to be found not in the Epitome but in his "commentary [sharb, perush]" on Aristotle's De anima.'" A brief composition of Averroes' dealing with the possibility of the human intellect's becoming "conjoined" to the active intellect and several passages in Averroes' Middle Commentary on the De anima advocate what he explicitly labels as Alexander's position. Both works judge the material intellect to be a disposition in the human organism without-unlike Ibn Bajja-assigning it to any specific faculty of the soul; and the Middle Commentary follows Alexander in comparing it to the disposition in a writing tablet.'9 But another passage in the Middle Commentary, a passage I assume to be a later addition inserted by Averroes into the original ver- sion, sets forth the difficulties in the positions of both Alexander and Themistius and arrives at what Averroes calls a "combination [jam'; qibbus] of the two." The material intellect, Averroes here determines, is not exclu- sively a disposition nor exclusively an incorporeal substance; it consists in an incorporeal substance's joining a disposition within the imaginative faculty.

The opuscule on conjunction was translated into Latin in the sixteenth century under the title Epistola de connexione intellectus abstracti cum homine. A different Latin translation of the opuscule was incorporated into chapters 1-3 of a work entitled Tractatus de Animae Beatitu- dine. The Tractatus carries the name of Averroes, but it is patently the handiwork of a Latin writer, presumably late, who fashions the present opuscule on the subject of conjunction, a related opuscule on the same subject (see below, n. 30), excerpts from Alfarabi, and transitional material of his own into a single treatise. The distinction between possibilitas and potentia in chapter 2 of the Tractatus betrays a Latin provenance; such a distinction would not be drawn in Arabic. See M. Steinschneider, Al-Farabi (St. Petersburg, 1869), pp. 96-104. The Epistola and the Tractatus were reprinted repeatedly in the sixteenth-century Latin editions of Averroes' commentaries.</page><page sequence="5">AVERROES AND NARBONI ON THE MATERIAL INTELLECT 179 imaginative faculty engenders the material intellect is the "active intellect," the last in the hierarchy of incorporeal beings that govern the physical universe.20 Averroes' Long Commentary on the De anima pursues yet another tack. The Long Commentary categorically refutes Alexander's position, accord- ing to which the material intellect is a mere disposition in the human or- ganism, and Ibn Bajja's, according to which the material intellect is a disposition in the imaginative faculty.21 Averroes indeed complains that recent philosophers flocked to Alexander's banner because of no intrinsic merit in Alexander but merely because of his inflated reputation.22 Although Averroes expresses reservations regarding Themistius' theory of intellect as well,23 he construes the material intellect as Themistius had done; he finds it to be an incorporeal substance wholly distinct from the active intellect, and he concludes that a single material intellect serves all mankind.24 Once the material intellect is taken to be a substance, Aristotle's analogy of the writ- ing tablet must be interpreted accordingly. Hence Averroes observes: "To state that the material intellect resembles the disposition in the tablet [for receiving writing] . . ., as Alexander interprets Aristotle, is incorrect." The material intellect, being a substance, corresponds not to the disposition in the writing tablet, but "to the tablet insofar as it has the dispositon."25 Still one more composition of Averroes', his Commentary on Alexander's De intellectu, adopts a line similar to that of the Long Commentary on the De anima. "After lengthy study and intense application," Averroes writes there, he realized that a single, eternal, material intellect serves the entire human species.26 Nothing can absolutely guarantee that Averroes advanced his various theories of the material intellect in exactly the temporal sequence that I have given.27 His Epitomes are known, however, generally to be early, and his Long Commentaries, to be late.

DAVIDSON directs readers to Averroes' "commentary" on the De anima can, moreover, have only the Long Commentary in view.28 Undoubtedly, therefore, the Epitome of the De anima, which follows Ibn Bijja in construing the material intellect as a disposition in the imaginative faculty, is early,29 whereas the Long Commentary, which construes the material intellect as an incorporeal substance, is later. The passages that accept Alexander's construction of the material intellect as a disposition in the human organism-a small composition on "conjunction" and the original version of the Middle Commentary-are also presumably early; the position they endorse is close to that of the Epitome, and is categorically rejected in the Long Commen- tary. There remains the passage inserted into the Middle De anima which proposes a compromise, a "combination" of the positions of Alexander and Themistius. Conceivably, after the Long Commentary rejected Alexander's position outright and construed the material intellect as a single incorporeal substance common to all mankind, Averroes could have retreated to a hybridization of Alexander and Themistius. But on its face such a regression is not likely, and equally unlikely would be the supposition that the Long Commentary, Averroes' most conscientiously and minutely argued treat- ment of intellect, was a mere way-station on the road to a theory recorded in a few paragraphs of the Middle Commentary. The probable sequence, then, was this: Averroes' early works-the Epitome, a brief composition on conjunction with the active intellect, and the original version of the Middle Commentary-followed Ibn Bajja in construing the material intellect as a disposition in the imaginative faculty of the soul, or followed Alexander in construing it, less specifically, as a disposition in the human organism. Subsequently-in the passage inserted into the Middle Commentary- Averroes contemplated a "combination" of the positions of Alexander and Themistius. Finally-in his Long De anima and his commentary on Alexander's De intellectu-he concluded "after lengthy study and intense application" that a single, eternal, incorporeal material intellect serves all mankind. Consideration has so far been given to five of the seven works that deal formally with the human intellect. A sixth work, another brief composition on the possibility of conjunction with the active intellect, reveals no definite 28.

The Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction does not, as far as is known, exist in the original Arabic and has survived in a medieval Hebrew transla- tion thanks to Moses Narboni, who provided it with a commentary. The Epistle expresses itself unambiguously. The "material intellect," Averroes writes, "has been proven in the De anima to be a pure disposition, not per- fected by any form whatsoever."3' Aristotle's De anima will be searched in vain for a proof that the material intellect is a "pure disposition," and Averroes' mention of a proof must refer to the argument that Aristotle did offer for the potential intellect's containing no form whatsoever.32 Having construed the material intellect as a "pure disposition," Averroes identifies its locus within the human soul. He adduces the circumstance that the human "intellect in habitu [sekel be-qinyan = 'aql bil-malaka]," the stage at which man possesses a repertoire of intelligible thoughts and can call upon them at will,33 is "perfected through imaginative notions." Inasmuch as "imaginative forms are the substratum of intelligible thoughts, the poten- tiality for receiving intelligible thoughts-the so-called material intellect- must be connected [mequshshar] with those imaginative forms";34 the "material intellect," that is to say, inheres in the "imaginative soul."35 As the discussion proceeds, the analogy of the writing tablet comes up, and since Averroes is construing the human potential intellect as a pure disposition, he formulates the analogy with Alexander's nuance: The human disposition 30.

DAVIDSON for thought is "joined to imaginative forms as the disposition in the writing tablet is connected with the tablet."36 Averroes' Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction thus clearly follows Ibn Baijja in construing the human material intellect as a disposition in the imaginative faculty of the soul. It belongs to the early stage of Averroes' speculation on the human intellect and is to be bracketed with his Epitome of the De anima. Averroes could have desired no more careful and devoted a reader than Moses Narboni. Yet, for want of a few key texts, Narboni misread the texts he had. Of the seven compositions in which Averroes addresses the subject of intellect directly, a single one, the Long Commentary on the De anima, was unknown to medieval Hebrew readers.37 By chance, the Long Commentary was likewise the only one of the seven known to the medieval Scholastics- whence the radically different perceptions of Averroes entertained by medieval Hebrew and Scholastic philosophers. As has been seen, the Long Commentary offers a circumstantial account of Ibn Bajja, attributing to him the doctrine that the material intellect is a disposition in the human imagina- tive faculty. Averroes, for his part, concludes in the Long Commentary that a single eternal substance serves the entire human species as its material intellect. Since Narboni did not have the Long Commentary, he of course did not know the doctrine that Averroes attributed to Ibn Baijja there. The works of Ibn BLijja available to Narboni apparently lacked-as do the works available to us-a definitive statement on the material intellect. Narboni consequently could only conjecture how Ibn Baijja had construed it. In the absence of the Long Commentary, Narboni also did not know the position on the material intellect which Averroes had taken in what was probably his final effort. The conception of the material intellect which Averroes ultimately reached might have been gathered from the Commen- tary on Alexander's De intellectu, but Narboni failed to recognize that text's significance. 36.

Averroes' Epitome of the De anima circu- lated in different versions, as mentioned earlier, some Arabic manuscripts containing added passages, and other Arabic manuscripts lacking them. When read without the additions, the Epitome argues that the material intellect must be a disposition in the imaginative faculty of the human soul. But the passages interpolated into the body of the discussion recognize the plausibility of the contrary position, the construction of the material intel- lect as an incorporeal substance. And the passage appended at the end characterizes the preceding pages as Ibn Baijja's theory of intellect, blames lbn Bajja for having misled Averroes, and advises readers to seek Averroes' mature position on the issue in his "commentary" on the De anima. The Hebrew version of the Epitome contained both the interpolations in the body of the discussion and the remark added at the end.38 Narboni was thereby led astray. He took the interpolated suggestion that the material intellect may indeed be an incorporeal substance to repre- sent the original, genuine teaching of the Epitome. The passage appended at the end of the discussion of intellect in the Epitome describes what preceded as Ibn B ijja's theory. Since Narboni did not know what Ibn B jja's position had in fact been, and since he read the entire Epitome as advocating an incorporeal and substantive material intellect, he took the appended state- ment to mean that Ibn Bajja too had construed the material human intellect as an incorporeal substance. Finally, not knowing Averroes' Long Com- mentary, Narboni understood the remark directing readers to the "commentary" on the De anima as a reference to the Middle Commentary and not the Long Commentary. Narboni accordingly arrived at the follow- ing reconstruction: "In his Epitome, Averroes argued that man possesses an incorporeal part;.. . that is the view of Themistius . . . and Ibn Baijja [who construe the material intellect as an incorporeal substance]. ... Subse- quently, however, Averroes saw that a spiritual substance containing a disposition," a substance both incorporeal and yet infected with poten- tiality, "cannot conceivably exist." Averroes concluded that "the material intellect is, in one respect, a pure disposition ... and, in another respect, incorporeal. ... The material intellect is composed of a disposition in us ... and an [incorporeal] intellect joined to the disposition," the incorporeal intellect in question being the "active intellect."39" Confusing the true 38.

DAVIDSON sequence, Narboni supposes that Averroes began, in the Epitome, by con- struing the material intellect as an incorporeal substance; that such had been Ibn Bijja's doctrine; and that Averroes finally settled upon the intermediate, compromise position outlined in the Middle Commentary. To return once more to Averroes' Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunc- tion, Averroes there construes the "material intellect" as "a pure disposition [hakana gemura = isti'dad mabhd]" and locates it in the imaginative faculty of the soul.40 His words are certainly straightforward enough. Narboni nevertheless chooses not to understand Averroes as maintaining that the material intellect is a disposition and nothing else. Instead he interprets the phrase "pure disposition" to mean that one aspect of the material intellect is exclusively a disposition and not physical; the aspect that is a disposition is not "impressed in," "distributed through," and "intermixed with" the physical human organism. But, Narboni goes on, the material intellect has in Averroes' system another aspect as well. It is only "in one respect a dis- position . . . whereas in another respect it is an incorporeal being connected with the disposition."41 The Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction, which straightforwardly states Averroes' early construction of the material intel- lect as a disposition in the imaginative faculty, is thus forcibly harmonized by Narboni with what he took to be Averroes' final position, the theory that the material intellect consists in the active intellect's joining a disposition in the imaginative faculty.
