Brill, 1991. 350 pp. Fifteen years ago, the study of Latin American Jewry was not widely recognized even as a legitimate subfield of Jewish or Latin American studies. Fortunately that is no longer the case, and Latin American Jewish studies is flourishing with both disciplinary and national specialists. The establish- ment of the field, however, has produced publications on a surprisingly small number of topics. Robert Cohen's study of the relationship of envi- ronment to traditional culture among the Jews of Surinam is a welcome exception to the pattern. Cohen's work stands out for a number of reasons. First, Surinam, with its tiny eighteenth-century Jewish population in the colonial period, has not had a full-length monograph written about it in two centuries.' In spite of the fact that Jews made up a large proportion of Surinam's white popula- tion, and lived in a separate village with autonomous rights, the "Bible" of Latin American Jewish history, Judith L. Elkin's Jews of the Latin American Republics (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1980), does not even list the country in its index (though another Dutch-speaking land, Curaqao, is mentioned). Jews in Another Environment also stands out as one of the few discussions of colonial Latin American Jewry that does not concentrate on New Christians or Marranos. Yet it is not simply the subject that makes Cohen's study worth reading. He takes an exciting intellectual approach to the study of colonial American Jewry by setting out to analyze how environment, defined not simply as climate but as all conditions affecting life and develop- ment, impacts on behavior and the traditional values that construct it. Cohen has a strong grasp of the literature of Jewish history, Dutch history, and colonial American (not only U.S.) history, although some mention of the recent work done on Caribbean race relations would be a welcome addi- tion. Even so, it is the broad approach that makes this book valuable to a wide audience. Rather than recounting Surinam's Jewish history, and thus producing a book likely to be of marginal importance, Cohen has taken a theoretical approach to complex questions, using Surinam as a test case. 1.

In contrast to many other Jewish immigrant communities in the Americas, Surinam's Dutch and Dutch-descended Ashkenazim and Sephardim had a strong sense of reli- gious freedom. Yet religious freedom did not diminish the importance of push-factors in the decision to emigrate; the extraordinary pauperization of Jewish Amsterdam in the early eighteenth century meant that over 65 per- cent of the community was able to survive only with community support. At the same time, Jews were unlike many non-Jewish Dutch who had migrated temporarily to Surinam in order to make their fortunes and return to the Netherlands in style. It was against this particular historical background that Surinam's environment, which, except for climate, was deeply influenced by Amsterdam, would create a new Jewish psyche even while promoting the maintenance of old cultural patterns. Jews in Another Environment begins by constructing a theoretical base for later arguments on the relationship between environment and Jewish life. An analysis of the library holdings of David Cohen Nassy, Surinam's leading Jewish intellectual, for example, shows that "three centuries after the expulsion, Nassy was still first and foremost a Sephardi" (p. 115). This discussion, supported by a list of all the books held in the Nassy collection as well as of works cited by Nassy in his writings, nicely integrates theoreti- cal discussion and informational analysis. What it does not explain is why Cohen argues in his conclusion that the Surinamese environment "triumphed over traditional Jewish patterns" (p. 180). Perhaps the answer does not fall into the "either/or" category. In other words, Cohen provides ample evidence that any attempt to distinguish among strictly Surinamese, strictly Dutch, and strictly Jewish patterns is virtually impossible. One fascinating section of Jews in Another Environment is the examina- tion of the intellectual writings on the relationship between climate and health. This shows that, while there was general agreement on the unhealthi- ness of Surinam's environment, many Jews reached quite an old age, a point of some comment. Jews, Cohen discovers, had a crude death rate in Surinam between 1778 and 1794 that was even lower than the Jewish death rate in Amsterdam. The creative archival work needed to produce such a careful analysis of demography, immigration, and wealth is one of the strong points of Jews in Another Environment. This rich statistical information fortunately never dominates the work, and Cohen's focus remains clear throughout. If there is any one single thread running through Cohen's study, it is that of decline. Eighteenth-century Surinam, like the Netherlands, was economi-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 137 cally failing and was rapidly transformed from a culture of luxury in 1771 to a culture of poverty just five years later. This led to cultural and social decline as well. As the profits from plantations decreased, Jewish planters left and new urban dwellers took their place. Poor Jews who had settled in a prosperous colony found, within less than a decade, that they were living in a former "great colony" that could only look to its past glory with a sense of nostalgia. This had a particular effect on Jews whose deep historical memory of poverty in Amsterdam strengthened their perception of the decline of Surinam. As Cohen points out, Jews remained concentrated in Joden Savanna, an area that would by the end of the century be deserted. "Rather than the epitome of Jewish presence [in Surinam], it had come to represent the past" (p. 175). Robert Cohen's Jews in Another Environment is an important and useful addition to Jewish history, Latin American history, and colonial history as much for its approach as its topic. For scholars looking for new and exciting ways to analyze previously dismissed topics, Cohen's work will be of great help.2 Jeff H. Lesser Connecticut College New London, Conn.</page></plain_text>
