Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998. 754 pp., 596 pp. "Though [Ludwig] Lewisohn lacked to a remarkable degree the ability to look beyond his own ideas," wrote the literary critic and memoirist Alfred Kazin, "he had at least one paramount service to perform, and he failed in it as much for reasons beyond his control as through his own rigidity of mind and supreme lack of humility. For what Lewisohn was always declaiming, out of his self-conscious- ness in America and his Hebraism, was . .. that if a writer is not rooted in a native culture, if he does not belong or find happiness in his belonging, he is nothing."' Kazin's critique of Ludwig Lewisohn (1883-1955)-the German-born, American-bred literary and drama critic, playwright, essayist, translator, novelist, Zionist activist, and member of the first Brandeis University faculty-conceals as much as it reveals. To be sure, Lewisohn's literary output, marked by flashes of brilliance, is uneven and generally regarded as less important than that of his con- temporaries (e.g., Abraham Cahan, Henry Roth, and Anzia Yezierska) or the Amer- ican Jewish authors who succeeded him (e.g., Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, and Cynthia Ozick). Yet, as Kazin himself intimates, Lewisohn's spacework in no small measure fertilized the soil of American letters so that others might participate ful- ly and unapologetically in the arena of American literature and cultural criticism. In fact, it was the generation of "Jewish" intellectuals who succeeded Lewisohn- Alfred Kazin, Philip Rahv, Lionel Trilling, and others grouped around Partisan Re- view in the 1930s and 1940s-that eventually played a seminal role in legitimiz- ing "the emergence of modern American literature after a period of dark ignorance and repressive Victorian gentility" and proving that "America had at last come of age."2 How revealing then that Kazin's critical opus, fittingly entitled On Native Grounds, lavishes so much attention on Lewisohn and draws so deeply from the wellspring about which he was so clearly ambivalent. Plagued and pained by such critiques in his lifetime, Lewisohn nonetheless possessed keen insight in this re- gard, as suggested by his ironic quip about Kazin, a "goyish critic who as I didn't know, turns out to be a Jew and not the right kind" (vol. 2, p. 274).3 1.

Raider Against the backdrop of such cultural warfare and, more generally, the anx- iety-ridden experience of Jewish life in the turbulent decades that bridged the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ralph Melnick's magisterial two-volume study offers a historical and literary corrective on a grand scale. Asserting that Lewisohn was one of the modern era's most important and thought-provoking American Jewish writers, Melnick also identifies him as a figure whose "vast con- tribution to literature, the theater, social change, and the struggle for Jewish sur- vival and renewal has remained all but forgotten" (vol. 1, p. 11).4 Swept, as it were, into what Leon Trotsky dubbed "the ashbin of history," Melnick raises the follow- ing intriguing questions: "How might understanding [Lewisohn's] fall into obscu- rity help us ... ? Why the obscurity when lesser men [remain] known, even cele- brated?" (vol. 1, pp. 11-12).5 These are important ideas, rich with possibilities, and ones that also hint at the lopsidedness and idiosyncratic nature of much of con- temporary Jewish studies. Melnick persuasively argues that Lewisohn was an important transition fig- ure, one of those exceptional individuals in Jewish history whose life and work mirrored the transformation and modernization of the Jewish experience in Eu- rope, America, and Palestine. He was also deeply and often centrally involved in elite American, Jewish, and European circles, rubbing shoulders with many of the world's outstanding writers, intellectuals, and political leaders, including Sholem Asch, Carl Van Doren, Theodore Dreiser, James Joyce, Sinclair Lewis, Thomas Mann, H. L. Mencken, Paul Robeson, Chaim Weizmann, and Stephen S. Wise. It stands to reason, therefore, that a great deal can be learned about Jewish life, Amer- ican society, and the world of belles lettres generally by scrutinizing the life of this extraordinary, gifted, and highly self-conscious figure. The Life and Work of Ludwig Lewisohn reveals a great deal about its subject. This masterful account, based on years of prodigious and careful research into Lewisohn's volatile and prolific life, weaves together an engaging narrative from the wide-ranging successes, failings, and foibles of its remarkable and complex subject. However, the study also promises much that it does not deliver. Regret- tably, after 1,350 pages of detailed investigation, Melnick fails to propose a forth- right argument. We learn an extraordinary amount-more than this reader thought necessary-about the minutia of Lewisohn's life, his marital conflicts, extramari- tal affairs, petty jealousies, financial difficulties, and so on, so much so that the author's laudable goal of uncovering Lewisohn's entire life appears to have over- whelmed the biographer, deterring him from unraveling the core mystery that mo- tivated him in the first place. While Melnick's work compares favorably, on the whole, to other recent biographies of Jewish figures, it does not rise to the level of the handful of preeminent biographies in the field of Jewish studies, such as, say, Naomi W. Cohen's Jacob H. Schiff" A Study in American Jewish Leadership (1999); Ernst Pawel's The Nightmare ofReason: A Life ofFranz Kafka (1984); or Jehuda Reinharz's two-volume study of Chaim Weizmann (The Making ofa Zion- 4.

Unlike the latter, Melnick cannot, it seems, get out from under the considerable weight of his subject. In the final analysis, the data assembled in The Life and Work ofLudwig Lewisohn, albeit fascinating and intrinsically valuable, require a more rigorous conceptual frame. On the macro-level, Melnick's biography generally adheres to the chronolo- gy of Lewisohn's life and is punctuated by critical junctures in Jewish, American, and world history: World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution, the crash of the stock market in 1929; the Holocaust, World War II, the creation of Israel, and so forth. At its core, however, the study turns on the complicated story of Lewisohn's pas- sionate and troubled relationships with five women, each of whom plays a pivotal role in his life: his mother, Minna (nee Eloesser) Lewisohn; his first wife, Mary (Arnold Crocker Childs) Lewisohn, a non-Jew twenty years his senior, who refused to formally dissolve their marriage until 1937; his second wife, Thelma (nee Spear) Lewisohn, with whom he ran off to Europe in 1924 and who bore his son, James Elias Lewisohn, in 1933; his third wife, Edna (nee Manley) Lewisohn, who was twenty years his junior and a convert to Judaism; and his fourth wife, Louise (n~e Wolk) Lewisohn. Each of these episodes is punctuated with perceptive and in- sightful analyses of Lewisohn's troubled psychology and remarkable stamina as an engage Jewish writer, critic, and activist. Melnick is at his best and most convincing when, in the course of examin- ing Lewisohn's stream of semi-autobiographical writings, he makes the case for the use of fiction as a tool of literary and historical analysis. He demonstrates, for example, how The Broken Snare (1908), an attack on the elitist social and intel- lectual climate of early twentieth-century American higher education, parallels the young Lewisohn's isolation qua Jew at Columbia University and marginalization in American society. "Behind the mask of fiction," Melnick explains, "he could weigh everything, without fear of discovery or the pain of confrontation" (vol. 1, p. 120).6 In the telling of a young woman's struggle to be free of her own emotional restraints and of the Victorian, Pauline ethos that dominated American society in 1907 and defined her role in the world, he could at once explore his own parental dependency, examine his dispiriting relationship with his first wife, Mary, and at- tempt to redirect his life by finding a personal morality that would enable him to satisfy the emotional, sexual, intellectual, and artistic needs that had been unful- filled for so long (vol. 1, pp. 120-121).7 In a similar vein, Melnick culls important insights from the controversial au- tobiography Up Stream.: An American Chronicle (1922), a work that traces Lewisohn's transformation from an assimilated background in Charleston, South Carolina (where he became a believer in "Jesus Christ as my personal savior" and, like his parents, "an American, a Southerner, and a Christian"),8 to his emergence as a publicly and unapologetically self-conscious secular Jew.

Raider Stream as a vehicle to scrutinize not only Lewisohn's writing but also the prevail- ing artistic sensibilities and attitudes of the day. In the process, he uncovers a ver- itable web of intellectual and cultural attachments, associations, and friendships in which Lewisohn was deeply enmeshed. Interestingly, several of Lewisohn's close friends and associates were great literary figures themselves. Carl Van Doren, for example, "admired Ludwig's ability in Up Stream to 'utter the pain and rebellion in his heart, raising it to something universal.' He himself had been raised to en- dure and to hide his pain 'with an Indian silence.'" (vol. 1, p. 296).9 Melnick also points to H. L. Mencken as being "quick to understand Ludwig's journey toward his Jewish identity" and as someone upon whom Lewisohn had a significant im- pact (vol. 1, p. 302).0o As "a German Jew of sound and civilized stock," Ludwig's story of involvement with the Methodist Church, and his break from it, was to Mencken "a story of gradual recovery from that supreme storm of spiritual measles-with a dash of major surgery at the end," Up Stream itself. Without this process, the poet caught "inside the plaster Methodist" might never have emerged. Undoubtedly, Mencken's iconoclastic attitude added to this analysis. But as Lud- wig himself had finally come to understand, Mencken, too, saw the breaking of this mask as an act of ultimate necessity if he was to affirm his own identity (vol. 1, p. 302).11 Melnick also delves into Lewisohn's self-imposed exile, weaving together the varied strands of his ten-year European sojourn. Lewisohn left the United States following a highly visible and prolific period as literary editor of The Na- tion,which lasted from the end of World War One until his departure for Paris in 1924. In Europe, he sought relief from America's restrictive intellectual milieu (where he was "made always to feel a misfit") as well as escape from his first wife, who refused to grant him a divorce and worked assiduously to publicize Lew- isohn's alleged marital infidelity and other shortcomings. In this fruitful period, Lewisohn wrote, among other works, The Case ofMr. Crump (1926), an autobio- graphical novel about his bitter marriage to Mary-hailed by Sigmund Freud as "an incomparable masterpiece" and by Thomas Mann as "standing in the very fore- front of modern epic narrative."'2 He also produced Roman Summer (1927), in which the Jewish protagonist speaks of his longing for the gentile world, noting that "unless you're a rowdy, American life doesn't give you a chance at the sort of experience the artist needs"'3-a smug jibe, perhaps, at Ernest Hemingway, whose The Sun Also Rises appeared in 1926. All told, Lewisohn wrote some twenty books during his European residence. But it is The Island Within (1928), originally published as The Defeated in 1927, that endures as Lewisohn's most important and best known novel. (It was repub- lished in 1997 by Syracuse University Press.) Tracing the saga of a German Jew- ish immigrant family in America, The Island Within is a work of historical fiction 9.

In typically eloquent and artful style, Lewisohn, as narrator, explains the consequences of Jewish emanci- pation and the anxiety of the modern Jew: The badges of shame were removed; the ghettos were opened; the Jews flood- ed into the desert of the world. The long strain was broken, at least in the west of Europe and America, and the old stoicism faded through disuse. The na- tions said: Be like us and we shall be brothers and at peace! Then began the Jewish practice of protective mimicry; and it was practiced then and has been practiced since in myriad cases, not consciously to escape difference, con- spicuousness, and hence danger, but in a spirit of devotion, love, loyalty, fel- lowship. The Jews have wanted profoundly to be Americans, Englishmen, Germans, even Poles. ... Can such things be done? Can they be done without inflicting an inner hurt, a wound to the moral fiber? Can people in masses, as groups, repudiate their ancestry and its experience? Can the Jewish imagina- tion live permanently and gladly as though it had shared in the historic expe- riences which, in fact, Jews watched from without as outcasts and martyrs? ... For Jewishness is like that Hound of Heaven described by the poet. It tracks you through the universe; it lies in ambush from without and from within. You think you have achieved a perfection and a protective mimicry and on the lips of your dearest friend you see the unformed syllable Jew.14 To the dismay of this reviewer, Melnick only infrequently examines The Is- land Within. One searches in vain for a sustained or extended analysis of the nov- el in either of the two volumes. Indeed, it seems to be characteristic of Melnick's study that, while abounding with insights, clues, and thought-provoking com- ments, the biographer is content to cast sidelong glances rather than to ponder and theorize about the wider significance of Lewisohn's oeuvre. Consider, for exam- ple, Melnick's treatment of the reception accorded The Island Within by American Jewish critics: Within the Jewish world, Henry Montor's review of [March 9, 1928] in the New Palestine spoke first. Noting Ludwig's "metamorphosis" since "cast[ing] his fate irrevocably with that of his people" with the publication of Up Stream, Montor judged Island to be the American answer to The Education ofHenry Adams, though it touched on problems "more complex, their solution less ac- cessible. . . . His critical faculties have been sharpened, his powers of analysis have become more profound." ... Island was an excoriating attack upon all the disintegrating forces in Jewish life ... evident as the American Jew sur- renders to his environment .... Against such "uniformity and standardiza- tion," Montor saw Ludwig struggling in a work whose merits deserved to make it a best-seller. (vol. 1, p. 462)15 14.

Raider This would seem to be a ripe opportunity to study The Island Within as a re- fraction of Lewisohn at the height of his powers; at age forty-five, a mature Jew- ish writer, a recognizable force in American letters, and an astute observer of the American scene. Alas, here as elsewhere in the biography, Melnick brings us to the brink of discovery, deftly establishing connections between Lewisohn and the so- cial, literary, and political climate of the interwar period, but stops short of fully analyzing this configuration. Is there merit to Montor's comparison, and what does his suggestion reveal about an emergent American Jewish sensibility? What changes and dynamics marked American Jewish life during the turbulent decades between the wars? Finally, is Lewisohn's novel to be regarded as watershed in American Jewish literature, and, if so, how do we gauge its impact? To be sure, the study of Lewisohn's published corpus would itself constitute an enormous undertaking- forty-four books, forty-six edited and translated vol- umes, and over 130 articles ranging from literary and dramatic criticism to fiction to autobiography to polemics concerning American society, Judaism, Zionism, and modernity. Such an effort was conducted two decades ago on a modest scale by Seymour Lainoff in a well-conceived, if abbreviated, volume entitled Ludwig Lewisohn.16 Though Lainoff's study seemingly does not register in it, Melnick's biography is informed by the useful scholarly assessments of two other Lewisohn students, Stanley Chyet and Susanne Klingenstein. It is, perhaps, a commonplace observation that Lewisohn's life and work were shaped by a curious mixture of psychology, marital infidelity, arrogance, and sheer talent as well as antisemitism, elitism, and wartime forces beyond his con- trol. Such themes are underscored by the subtitles of Melnick's volumes, "A Touch of Wildness" and "This Dark and Desperate Age." It is questionable, however, to what extent the love affairs, unhappy marriages, and personal exploits that Mel- nick emphasizes, and which did, in reality, color Lewisohn's artistic, intellectual, and political activity, are really useful and instrumental as modes of analysis. Mel- nick is, I believe, correct when he argues that "as a writer, Ludwig lived by words, and in the very process of composing each line, he had often found an opportuni- ty to expose his innermost feelings and deepest thoughts to himself. On paper, he could dissect himself, question his motives, rearrange his ideas, and put the pieces together in a newly integrated pattern" (vol. 1, p. 175).17 This idea was suggested in a slightly different manner in 1942 when Henry Montor noted the following in a biographical sketch published in the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia: In the career of Ludwig Lewisohn is to be found the full cycle of experience of the Jewish people in the first two generations of the twentieth century. The pendulum of his life, which started with one far edge of faint association with problems as they affect Jews in America, swung slowly and then sharply to the opposite extreme, so that he became a symbol of Jews preoccupied with the problem of existence and not merely with the methods of living.'8 16.

It is to be hoped that a future biographer will synthesize Melnick's useful insights and address the important questions concerning Lewisohn's historical un-personhood, the impact of his writ- ing, and the notion that he was a central figure, if not paradigmatic, of the Amer- ican Jewish experience.
