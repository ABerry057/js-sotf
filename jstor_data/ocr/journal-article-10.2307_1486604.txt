Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990. The study of Italian Jewry from the fifteenth through the seventeenth century has recently encountered renewed interest. As is well known, Italian Jewry in this period has traditionally been considered a fine paradigm of confrontation with the more general problem of the definition of Jewish identity against the background of general culture. The use (and abuse) of notions and semantics of the "Renaissance"-by definition a concept implying a more or less conscious association of ideas with luminosity contrasting the darkness of the Middle Ages (by almost traditional definition the "Dark Ages")-has naturally helped to exacerbate the implications of the encounter between the Jewish and the non-Jewish cultures in terms of "confrontation" and of value-judgment (for instance, if the Renaissance was by definition "good," then the perception of Jewishness in terms of resistance to it should necessarily be perceived as "bad"). The semantics of acculturation, assimilation, cultural influences, and interaction between cultures, quite often used in this context without precise definition of meaning, may conceal quite different, deeply biased historical outlooks and ideological stances, ranging from plain Jewish or non-Jewish apologetics to equally plain recriminations or Jewish self-accusations. To be sure, the efforts of several scholars, some of them working in teams, have already enriched our AJS Review 19/1 (1994): 67-75 67</page><page sequence="2">68 REVIEW ESSAY library shelves with an impressive number of volumes of monumenta of all kinds, thus making possible an efficacious revisiting of our issue with greater chances of evaluating it sine ira et studio. Yet, not unreasonably, we may assume that the problem of historical interpretation relative to it still derives much strong appeal from the acuteness of the contemporary perception of the questions concerning modern definitions of Jewish identity. One may also feel quite justified, therefore, in assigning the ongoing scholarly discussions to the very same context. David Ruderman's contribution to the discussion is already most signif- icant. In fact, his works assign Ruderman a place of primary importance. Ruderman has been searching out models of positive coping in relations between Jews and non-Jews on the cultural level, in particular models (perhaps one should say paradigms) of the cultural "integration" of Jews into the general contexts of their diasporical life. His primary field of research, therefore, has quite naturally been that of Italian Jewry during the Renaissance. According to Ruderman's most recent formulation, the first questions to be asked in this context are: "To what extent were Jews earnestly preoccupied with the concerns of Renaissance culture? Was there a Jewish humanist movement comparable to that of Italian culture of the period? Can one legitimately speak of a Jewish Renaissance in Italy coterminous with the Italian Renaissance? Did Italian Renaissance culture actually exert a decisive influence on Jewish thought or did its impact constitute no more than a passing fad or superficial encounter?"' It seems to me that the italicized words in the preceding quotation may give a fair idea of Ruderman's primary scholarly concerns: discovering paths of influence leading from the non-Jewish to the Jewish space, determining degrees of earnestness in the Jewish approaches to the non-Jewish world, ascertaining the existence of "parallel lives" among Jews and Christians, and verifying the legitimacy of including the "Jewish contribution" to the Renaissance as an essential part of that cultural phenomenon.2 Ruderman is not simply pursuing the traditional bent of Jewish his- toriography rooted in nineteenth-century Wissenschaft des Judentums and 1.

Like most (indeed all) contemporary students of Jewish history in Renaissance Italy, Ruderman at first felt profoundly influenced by these masters.3 However, his interests gradually have shifted to the involvement of Jews in science at the dawn of the modem era.4 The first major result was his biography of Abraham Yagel, a Jewish physician living in northern Italy between 1553 and ca. 16235--a period that, as we will later point out, Ruderman would prefer to characterize as Baroque, rather than Renaissance. As is the case with pioneering works in all fields, Ruderman's treatment of the history of Jewish science in the early modern period had to confront some basic challenges, essentially not different from those most students of the history of science confront. Some of them are summarized pretty well by the following introductory remarks written several decades ago by I. Bernard Cohen in a review essay about books on the history of science: While appreciating that scientific ideas are an essential part of the complex of ideas in any given portion of history-and more essential in some periods or cultures than in others-the historian of ideas in general is more apt to value the history of science as an ancillary discipline to his own than as the be-all and end-all of historical research or even as an independent sphere of activity. Thus, the historian of science, if he wishes to make his research have the impact on scholarship it deserves, must consciously strive to make his results intelligible to others, a word that includes "other" historians of science just as much as "other" kinds of historians. . . . Every historian of science has a double obligation: to produce original scholarly research which may or may not be generally understandable to those without his own special competences, and also to help to make his work and that of his colleagues a part of the knowledge of every historian who may be concerned in any way with the culture in which that science was produced or which was affected by it. ... 3.

Indeed, it raises basic questions of "simple" linguistic translation from a language and a culture most historians consider exotic (a statement that holds true, I believe, even if we restrict ourselves to Hebrew-reading audiences). The more so, if we take into consideration the fact that Hebrew-written medieval and early-modern scientific discourse is organically interwoven with other no less "exotic" discourses, with which we have only recently begun to be acquainted, such as Kabbalah and magic. In fact, the crucial role of magic in the progress of science, its intriguing relationship to reason and experience besides religion and religious practice,7 as well as the intricacy of Kabbalah as a system of beliefs, thought, and practices, are quite recent scholarly acquisitions, on which it seems that we still are not able to perceive much more than the tip of the iceberg. Thanks to great erudition and the mastery of diverse scholarly disciplines, Ruderman has successfully handled this linguistic and expository challenge. In so doing, he has brought Hebrew literary production related to Kabbalah, magic, and science to the attention and scrutiny of the general audience of historians, and rendered it intelligible. He has also proposed viewing it as an organic part of the general restructuring of the perception of knowledge started toward the end of the sixteenth century. Ruderman pursues his goal with an eye firmly oriented toward non-Jewish conceptions and practices of science; he tries to locate influence exercised from the Christian space on the Jewish one. In so doing, he proposes to verify the legitimacy of assigning the 6. I. Bernard Cohen, "Some Recent Books on the History of Science," in Roots of Scientific Thought: A Cultural Perpective, ed.

Abraham Yagel was indeed one of these men-a Jewish moneylender, medical doctor, and prolific writer. Yagel was undoubtedly a minor intel- lectual figure, not only when compared with contemporary Christians such as Cardano or Galileo, but also in juxtaposition to Jews like Leon Modena or Menahem Azariah da Fano. His life, as it is described by Ruderman's meticulous reconstruction, may hardly be thought of as unveiling unknown or particularly exciting aspects of Italian Jewish life. Although he seems to have been more successful as a physician than as a moneylender, his life is typically tinged with insecurity (occasionally even persecution and imprisonment) and bitterness bordering on distress. His engagement in intellectual ruminations and scholarly writing thus emerges as a means of overcoming the dullness of his precarious everyday existence. However, rather than being some kind of learned evasion of ordinary life, as were the writings of many Cinquecento Italian intellectuals, Yagel's literary effort must be read as an expression of the Jewish striving to make sense of human life in general and of Jewish life in particular, at a time which, as is well known, was dramatically crucial for Italian Jews. Although Yagel's literary production may quite safely be characterized as mediocre, Ruderman proposes that we discover in this quality (which in a sense characterized Farissol as well) some kind of Archimedean point that eventually may be instrumental in raising the question of how Jewish culture coped with non-Jewish culture on the social level. For if Yagel does not offer our curiosity any exciting scholarship, he certainly presents us with what most (if not almost all) Jews of his time held to be first-rate scholarship, and which they tried to conform to in order to consider themselves up-to-date literati. Ruderman's focus on a mid-level figure like Yagel is therefore highly suggestive and stimulating in proposing a new direction for research. It is indeed from this perspective that in Kabbalah, Magic and Science, Ruderman wove themes "picked out" from Yagel's Valley of Vision into a mosaic that recreates Yagel's Weltanschauung as paradigmatic of the making of a new Jewish cultural identity in early modern Italy. The result achieved in Kabbalah, Magic and Science is summarized in the introduction to Valley of Vision. The rest of the book contains the complete text of this work by Yagel, presented to the reader in English translation. However, given the often cryptic nature of the Hebrew original, it must be stressed that Ruderman has</page><page sequence="6">72 REVIEW ESSAY provided much more than simply a translation. The importance of his book lies in the literary analysis of the text and in the learned explanatory notes appended to the translation. The rich apparatus of erudite footnotes, actually a mine of information that undoubtedly will trigger future research, enlarges the reader's horizon and enables him to grasp many hidden facets of Yagel's discourse. As already noted by I. Zinberg and M. A. Shulvass, Yagel's book is in fact written in the genre of the Italian novella. Yet, although admitting the great dependence of Yagel's Valley of Vision on La piacevol notte et lieto giorno composed by Nicolao Granucci (1522-1603),8 Ruderman prefers, especially in his notes and commentary, to assign more importance to the "scientific" components of Yagel's discourse. Although he urges us to consider Yagel's Valley of Vision as a unique autobiography (see p. 23), and devotes special chapters to what one would characterize as definitely literary and sociocultural themes,9 it seems that he prefers the perspective of intellectual history to those of literary or sociocultural history. Ruderman is charmed by what appears to him as "the underlying message of the Valley of Vision,"'1 i.e., the network of relationships emerging from Yagel's prose between the natural and the supernatural, as well as between empirical knowledge of the kind we would characterize as "popular" and traditional authoritative learning, drawn obviously from Jewish sources, but also from non-Jewish ones, which following the medieval Jewish tradition Yagel considered acceptable. In a series of learned philological inquiries included in his notes and commentary, Ruderman unravels a host of threads of that network and shows how they are variously linked to a multiplicity of contexts, including the humanist one of Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino, the Kabbalah, and the medical as well as belletristic literature of the sixteenth century. One wonders how justified is Ruderman's decision to privilege the scientific dimension of a novella over its literary and sociocultural aspects." 8. This fact was already pointed out by Giulio Busi, "Sulla Ge Hizzayon (La valle della visione) di Abraham Yagel," Annali della Facoltri di Lingue e Letterature Straniere di Ca' Foscari 23 (1984): 19, and is duly acknowledged by Ruderman on p. 29, n. 81. 9. Particularly the impact of Boethius and the Consolatio genre, the use of popular emblematic handbooks in the teaching of Judaism, the theme of the involvement of Jews in gambling, the birth of Siamese twins in the Jewish ghetto of Venice in 1575, and some others. 10. This is the title of the concluding chapter of the introduction (pp. 60-65), followed only by "a final reflection on the Valley of Vision and the Baroque sensibility," and a technical preface to the English translation. 11. One might even ask: in order to investigate the "scientific" component of Yagel's world,</page><page sequence="7">SOME REFLECTIONS ON A BAROQUE JEWISH NOVELLA 73 An example will show more concretely the kind of problem posed by his choice. One of the most fascinating chapters of the book is "The Gambler's Speech," which is a speech delivered by one of the souls allegedly encountered by Yagel on his heavenly journey. The speech includes, among other things, a discussion of the excellence of the number seven, followed by a statement of Yagel's: "However, in reality, only six is a perfect number, as is clear to the mathematicians" (p. 97). In the footnote appended by Ruderman to this statement (n. 7) we find a reference to V. F. Hopper's Medieval Number Symbolism, suggesting the consideration of a quotation from Philo. In other words, the intertextual perspective Ruderman urges upon us is that of medieval number symbolism. To this we are supposed to associate what we know about kabbalistic and magic numerology, in the scientific framework previously established in the same chapter and the gambler's speech by a lengthy discussion on the zodiac, stars, and heavenly influences. One wonders if such an approach is not somehow misleading, not only in that it overstates Yagel's "popular" discourse, but also because it does not take into account the possible relevance of popular discussions of the like, as attested in the novelistic productions of the period, in which, beyond the learned panoply of quotations, one perceives clearly the ironic dimension emerging from the mundane (almost empty) function of such discussions. For instance, this occurs in one of Firenzuola's novels, where the discussion on the "perfection" of the number six, according to the "mathematicians," expands over no less than five pages, closing with a clever joke.12 Still, what is wrong in preferring one kind of theme over the variety of many others? It seems to me that in determining the nature of the information offered to his reader, Ruderman is doing much more than simply preferring themes and motives which especially attracted him. In presenting Yagel's culture as almost directly linked with the humanism of Pico and Ficino, and in stressing its intellectual and scientific significance over its popular and social significance, he in fact is delving into one of the most intriguing questions concerning the history of Italian Jewry: whether the phenomenon of Jewish scientists, mostly doctors at that time, is actually to be considered as continuing the overall phenomenon of the Italian Jewish Renaissance (be its would it not have been more effective to focus on Yagel's more scientific Moshia' Hosimn (Venice, 1587), which is a quite typical work on the plague, much akin to dozens of similar works written by contemporary Italian doctors? 12.

It seems to me that Ruderman has opted for continuity. To be sure, he no longer assumes the monolithic unity of the entire period, as did Roth and Shulvass, and as many still do. His position is much more sophisticated, indeed quite new. As noted above, he adopts the characterization of the Baroque instead of that of the Renaissance. Yet, this choice of terminology does not seem to imply the assumption of any essential difference between the periods, as far as the main questions interesting Ruderman are concerned. On the contrary, it seems to me that he persists in positing the necessity of maintaining without significant modification the interpretative categories describing how the Jews coped with the cultural context of the Renaissance (as he construed them in his first book)13 even in the following period, however one wishes to name it-Late Renaissance, Counter-Renaissance, or Baroque period. The principal difference is that Ruderman's paradigmatic figures are now physicians rather than philosophers, and the field of knowledge is more specifically science in its increasingly modern (empirical) sense rather than philosophy as perceived by medieval or even humanist thinkers. In sum, Ruderman is adamant in assuming continuity between the Ren- aissance and the Baroque, as far as the attitude of Italian Jews regarding non-Jewish culture is concerned. In fact, Ruderman quite adamantly defends the idealized picture of Italian Jewry as one of continuous openness toward outside culture and of uninterrupted organic interwining with it. Indeed, he has himself quite overtly taken a position on this issue, stating the existence of a "characteristic mode of Italian-Jewish civilization, at least until the threshold of the modern era,"'4 which consisted "in absorbing diverse Jewish and non-Jewish cultural forms and creatively molding them into constantly novel configurations, in patiently tolerating diversity and discord, in channeling ideas and values from one place to another as an entrepot and clearinghouse of merchandise, and in allowing individuality to blossom within a framework of communal consensus."" According to Ruderman, it is in this "refreshingly appealing" image of Italian Jewry, conceived as some kind of constante de trcs longue durde, that ultimately can "be located not only the essential 13.

"Absorbing diverse Jewish and non-Jewish cultural forms and creatively molding them into constantly novel configurations""7 is not a unique virtue of Italian Jewry, but rather of Judaism in all times and places. The real question is not one of ascertaining the mere fact of such "absorptions," but rather of the different ways in which they took place in different temporal and spatial contexts. Ruderman assumes that the erudite discovery of hundreds of sources for Yagel's discourse in the literary output of renowned fifteenth-century humanists is a clear demonstration of continuity between the cultural attitudes of fifteenth-century humanism and those of a middle-brow Jewish physician, who, at the threshold between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, read humanist texts and a variety of other printed books readily available to most literates. But this assumption ultimately may obstruct a full understanding of this physician's ruminations. Such an understanding, I submit, might have much to gain from a further focusing on those literary and sociocultural aspects which were intentionally neglected by Ruderman. However, this is certainly not to underestimate Ruderman's accomplish- ment, for it is thanks to this scholar's work that we now may much more easily approach Italian Jewish culture in the Baroque period. He has in fact entered a totally new field. Until now, nobody has gone so far beyond the erudite bibliographical lists of Moritz Steinschneider. Ruderman's work therefore must be considered as pioneering. His two books on Abraham Yagel provide basic tools for any future discussion of the cultural and social history of early modern Italian Jewry. We now look forward to Ruderman's publication of the Hebrew original, a service that will leave scholars even more in his debt. Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel 16. Ibid. 17.
