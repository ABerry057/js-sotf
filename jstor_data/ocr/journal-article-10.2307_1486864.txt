<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUEST FOR THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM by TAL ILAN Beruriah, reputedly the greatest Jewish woman scholar of all times, has figured prominently in anthologies describing the lives and deeds of Jewish sages,' and in particular in books and collections dedicated to Jewish women.2 Most of these presentations are no more than paraphrases of the sources on which they are dependent, accepting their judgments at face value and thus giving an idealized description of the woman Beruriah. 1.

AJS Review 22/1 (1997): 1-17 1</page><page sequence="2">2 TAL ILAN In 1975 David Goodblatt published an article entitled "The Beruriah Traditions."3 Its purpose was to trace the historical Beruriah. Goodblatt used literary-critical techniques in order to demonstrate that the Beruriah traditions should not be taken at face value but should be analyzed according to the date of the compilations in which they appear, and that each tradition should be analyzed individually before being taken as part of the whole. Goodblatt came to the conclusion that two, perhaps three, historical women of the tannaitic period had been incorporated into the legendary amoraic Beruriah-(1l) Beruriah, (2) the daughter of Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion, and (3) the wife of Rabbi Meir-and that the tannaitic Beruriah was only versed in some of the laws pertaining to women's conduct in the home. He concluded that it was only in the Babylonian Talmud that Beruriah emerged as a full-fledged scholar. Although the image of Beruriah has been further discussed since Goodblatt published this article,4 new studies of the Beruriah traditions, or for that matter of any other talmudic Jewish women, would do well to take Goodblatt's conclusions into account.5 Furthermore, Goodblatt's techniques could be 3.

See above, n. 2; also: Rachel Adler, "The Virgin in the Brothel and Other Anomalies: Character and Context in the Legend of Beruriah," Tikkun 3, no. 6 (1988): 28-32, 102-105; D. Boyarin, Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), pp. 167-196. Both of these works will be discussed below. 5. For example, in an article published in 1973, Alisa Shenhar discussed the folktale nature of the story of Rabbi Meir's wife and the death of his two sons (Midrash Mishlei 31:10). See her "Le-Amamiyuta shel Agadat Beruriah Eshet Rabbi Meir" ("On the Folkloristic Nature of the Legend of Beruriah Wife of Rabbi Meir"), in Mehkarei ha-Merkaz le-Heker ha-Folklore (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1973), vol. 3, pp. 223-227. After Goodblatt's discussion, Shenhar's choice of a name for the article implies that she failed to notice that Midrash Mishlei leaves Rabbi Meir's wife unnamed. It is interesting to note that Judith Hauptman, although not yet familiar with Goodblatt's ideas, did not analyze all the Beruriah traditions as a whole in her "Images of Women in the Talmud," in Religion and Sexism: Images of Women in Jewish and Christian Traditions, ed. Rosemary R. Ruether (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1974), pp. 201, 203, 204. Leone Archer, Her Price Is Beyond Rubies: The Jewish Woman in Graeco-Roman Palestine, JSOT Supplement Series 60 (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990), pp. 97-99, had read Goodblatt's article and agreed with his conclusions because they fitted with her general notion of women's position in Palestine at the time, but she failed utterly to internalize his systematic source analysis, as is shown by her treatment of the Beruriah traditions, and by her general attitude to the rabbinic literature throughout her book. However, Goodblatt's conclusions are hardly worth mentioning when not dependent on his source analysis.</page><page sequence="3">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 3 employed in a deeper analysis of the Beruriah traditions and also in the study of two other famous talmudic women, Rabbi Aqiva's wife and Imma Shalom. Beruriah Goodblatt demonstrated that several of the Beruriah traditions should be viewed as nothing more than literary compositions in which the name Beruriah is a secondary insertion. He compared the Beruriah traditions in the Babylonian Talmud with similar literary compositions found in Palestinian compilations from which Beruriah is absent. For instance, the tradition in the Babylonian Talmud (bPesahim 62b) where Beruriah is held up by Rabbi Yohanan as an example of an industrious and outstanding student is brought in the Palestinian version without any personal example (yPesahim 5:3, 32a). The story of Rabbi Meir's escape from the Roman authorities is connected in the Babylonian Talmud with his attempt to rescue Beruriah's sister from a brothel (bAvodah Zarah 18b), whereas the Palestinian tradition knows of no such sister-in-law (Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:11). However, this technique is useful for more than just proving the superiority of the Palestinian traditions. If we can demonstrate that a Beruriah tradition is a literary framework into which Beruriah was incorporated at a later stage, the compilation in which the parallel is found is not essential to the model. One of the Beruriah traditions has a parallel in the Babylonian Talmud itself, but its heroes are not Beruriah and her husband, Rabbi Meir, but the saintly Abba Hilqia and his wife. The Beruriah tradition runs as follows: Certain bandits who were in the neighborhood of Rabbi Meir troubled him much. He prayed that they die. Beruriah, his wife, said to him: Do you base your prayer on what is written: "Let sins cease" (Ps. 104: 35)? Is "sinner" written? "Sins" is written. Furthermore, cast your eyes to the end of the verse, "and they are wicked no more." Since sins will cease, they will be wicked no more. He prayed for them and they repented. (bBerakhot 1Oa) Goodblatt noted that Beruriah is not essential to the plot of this tale but a wife is, and he assumed that the wife was Rabbi Meir's. However, in the parallel the heroes are Abba Hilqia and his wife. At the instigation of the rabbis, they pray together for rain; clouds emerge from her direction rather than his. In</page><page sequence="4">4 TAL ILAN answer to the sages' query about why this happened, Abba Hilqia tells them: "There were once bandits in our neighborhood. I prayed that they die, but she prayed that they repent" (bTa 'anit 23b).6 The differences between the traditions are obvious: while Abba Hilqia's wife prays herself, Beruriah quotes Scripture to her husband in order to improve the quality of his prayer. This results from the difference between the two women as literary characters. Beruriah is a scholar, Abba Hilqia's wife is a pious woman. However, it is obvious that we are dealing here with the same literary composition, which, therefore, has no historical significance.7 In differentiating chronologically between the tannaitic and later Beruriah traditions, Goodblatt discarded from the start the infamous tradition, recorded only by Rashi, which relates Beruriah's seduction, fall from grace, and tragic end. One time she [Beruriah] mocked the sages' saying [that] "Women are light- headed." [Rabbi Meir] said to her: By your life, you will eventually affirm their words. He instructed one of his disciples to seduce her. He urged her for many days until she consented. When the matter became known to her, she strangled herself, and Rabbi Meir fled out of disgrace. (Rashi to bAvodah Zarah 18b) Goodblatt claimed that this tradition is unreliable because of its late date, and is of no use in a historical reconstruction. In adopting this view he fails to inquire into the historical motives behind the composition of such a legend, and consequently its deviation from the themes of all the other Beruriah traditions. This question is exactly the one posed by two recent studies. Daniel Boyarin explained this tradition as a literary composition that is an antithesis to the story of Beruriah's sister in the brothel (bAvodah Zarah 18a-b). The sister had begun her life as a frivolous girl, but when the crunch came, passed Rabbi Meir's modesty test, while Beruriah began her life as a scholar, but failed the same test.8 In Boyarin's opinion this proves that the Beruriah 6. A similar tradition about a saintly man who brings rain is found in the Palestinian Talmud (yTa 'anit 1:4, 64b), where the wonder-worker is simply referred to as "a saint of Kefar Ami," but the story of rain coming from the wife's direction and its explanation are missing. 7. This, as opposed to the opinion expressed by Goldfeld, "Women as Sources of Torah," pp. 265, 267-269, who sees in these two traditions two separate examples of Jewish women serving as sources of Torah transmission. 8. Boyarin, Carnal Israel, pp. 184-192.</page><page sequence="5">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 5 legend's Sitz im Leben is Babylonia in the late amoraic or gaonic period, and that the legend was created to oppose the idea of educating women. Rachel Adler claims that Rashi's story is essential to the "legend" (in the singular) of Beruriah.9 Adler maintains that the aim of the entire Beruriah corpus (which she takes as a literary whole) is to wrestle with the unlikely prospect: "What if there were a woman who was just like us [men]?"'1 The story of Beruriah's seduction and disgrace is essential for Adler's theory. If a woman like Beruriah had indeed existed, she would have had to come to a bad end even if it meant that her own husband had to play the pimp for her. Therefore, according to Adler's scenario, the story of Beruriah's seduction is of rabbinic, probably Babylonian, provenance. In her enthusiasm to show how harshly the sages dealt with seduced women, as opposed to their lenient treatment of seduced men, Adler refers the reader to another midrash, relating the seduction of none other than Beruriah's husband, Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Meir used to scoff at transgressors. One day Satan appeared to him in the guise of a woman on the opposite bank of the river. There was no ferry, so he seized the rope and proceeded across. When he had reached halfway along the rope [Satan] let him go, saying: Had they not proclaimed in Heaven, "Take heed of Rabbi Meir and his learning," I would have valued your life at two dimes. (bQiddushin 81a) According to Adler, this story shows that men were more easily tempted than women, but did not come to a bad end." 9. Adler, "Virgin in the Brothel." 10. Ibid., p. 29. A similar sentiment was voiced earlier by H. Kosmala, "Gedanken zur Kontroverse Farbstein-Hoch," Judaica 4 (1948): 231-232. 11. The connection between the two seduction stories was already noted by Blumenthal, Rabbi Meir: Leben und Wirken, pp. 111-112. On the literary motif of this seduction story, see J. Perles, "Rabbinische Aggadas in 1001 Nacht," Monatsschriftfir Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 22 (1873): 78-81. Another story about Rabbi Meir being seduced is found in the late midrash on the Ten Commandments; cf. A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (Jerusalem: Bamberger &amp; Wahrmann, 1938), vol. 1, pp. 81-83. On the connection between the three seduction stories and a theory making Rashi's version old and authentic, see Alisa Shenhar, "Le-Demuto shel Rabbi Meir ve-Itzuva be-Safrut ha-Agadah," in Heker ve-Iyun be-Madaei ha-Yahadut, ed. Y. Bahat, M. Ben-Asher, and T. Fenton (Haifa: Haifa University Press, 1976), pp. 259-266.</page><page sequence="6">6 TAL ILAN Adler's literary analysis assumes the existence of a "Beruriah legend," a literary composition which, according to Goodblatt, and also in my view, did not exist. However, her interpretation draws closer to identifying the origin of Rashi's Beruriah episode. Rashi relates this tale as a commentary on an obscure talmudic expression, "The Beruriah Event" (xKirlnl tnn) which follows the story of Rabbi Meir's flight to Babylonia (bAvodah Zarah 18b). According to one opinion, Rabbi Meir fled for fear of the Roman authorities, but according to another, his motive was "The Beruriah Event."'2 When Rashi relates this event, he connects Beruriah's downfall to a saying of the sages on the nature of women ("women are light-headed") which is found in a totally different section of the Babylonian Talmud: bQiddushin 80b. Surprisingly, it is exactly in this part of the vast talmudic corpus that the story of the seduction of Rabbi Meir is found. This, however, should not be viewed as a mere coincidence. Rashi must have had this fact in mind when he constructed the Beruriah narrative. An attempt to trace his train of thought in the composition process is very speculative, but it is clear that the tradition found in Rashi relies on three distinct literary components. The first of these was an amoraic saying about the light-headed nature of women, followed by the Rabbi Meir seduction story. The second was another Beruriah tradition in which she mocks a saying of the sages about the nature of women. This story, however, does not have a tragic ending: Rabbi Yosi the Galilean was walking along the road. He met Beruriah. He said to her: By which road shall we go to Lod (nT* 1, l'tr J- Kan)? She said to him: Galilean fool! Did not the sages say: "Do not talk too much with a woman" (mAvot 1:5)? You should have said: By which to Lod (Ti?bb S rlK)? (bEruvin 53b) The third component was a literary motif on feminine corruptibility: all women can be seduced, and it is just a question of the right amount of pressure. This well-known motif is found often in folklore, and documented already in Hellenistic literature.'3 These three together are the ingredients from which the medieval Beruriah legend was composed. 12. Boyarin, Carnal Israel, p. 193, claims that the medieval scholar Rabbi Judah of Ashkenaz understood lo'na ,~at as her halakhic rulings, which her husband did not follow, and as a result had to go into exile. But in Judah's Yohasei Tannaim ve-Amoraim, ed. N. N. Rabinovitz (Lyck: Makitze Nirdamim, 1874), pp. 10 Ob-1 la, I found no hint of this interpretation. 13. For a thorough analysis of this literary theme, see H. Schwartzbaum, "International Folklore Motifs in Joseph ibn Zabara's 'Sefer Shaashuim'," in Studies in Aggadah and Jewish</page><page sequence="7">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 7 It is not possible to pursue further the origins of the Beruriah episode itself, but Rashi's handling of material in similar cases can be traced. Another tale involving a woman is found in Rashi's commentary on the Talmud. In explaining who Yohani daughter of Retabi was, a woman mentioned by name in bSotah 22a but about whom nothing else is stated, Rashi says: She was a widow and a witch, and when a woman's time to give birth drew near she would close her womb with charms, and after much suffering [on the part of the woman in labor] she would say: "I shall go and ask for mercy, perhaps my prayers will be answered," and she would go and undo her charms, and the baby would then be born. One time she had a day laborer in her house, and when she went to the house of the woman in labor he heard the charms rattling in a vessel as the baby rattles in his mother's womb, so he went and opened the lid of the vessel and the charms were released and the child was born, and thus they knew she was a witch. As opposed to the Beruriah tradition, in this case we can trace some of the story's literary history. It is found in a collection of midrashim published by M. Gaster and ascribed to Rabbi Nissim of Kairouan (in North Africa), a sage of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, a generation earlier than Rashi.14 However, in the version published by Gaster the witch is unnamed. In this case Rashi himself seems to have been responsible for inserting the name of a historical figure into an anonymous story, much as the compilers of the Babylonian Talmud had often done before him." It appears, therefore, Folklore, ed. I. Ben-Ami and J. Dan = Folklore Research Center Studies (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1983), vol. 7, pp. 66-71, n. 38. Cf. M. H. Levine, "Three Talmudic Tales of Seduction," Judaism 36 (1987): 466-470. On the international nature of this theme and its connection with the theme of the widow of Ephesus, also found in the Tosafot's commentary on bQiddushin 80b (see dibur ha-mathil "ki"), see E. Grisebach, Die Wanderung der Novelle von der treulosen Wittwe durch die Welt Literatur (Berlin: F. &amp; P. Lehmann, 1889), pp. 26-29, 51. 14. M. Gaster, The Exempla of the Rabbis (1924; reprint ed., New York: Ktav, 1968), p. 158, no. 412. 15. I would like to draw attention here to the danger of using Rashi as though his text were part of the Talmud. Recently, in a really excellent and learned book, Ross S. Kraemer quoted this Rashi narrative as if it were from some rabbinic work. It is not clear whether Kraemer assumed that the story was found in the Mishnah or in the Babylonian Talmud, since she cites it as "m. Sotah 22b." The consequences of this mistake for her study are obvious. See Ross S. Kraemer, Her Share of the Blessing: Women 's Religion Among Pagans, Jews and Christians (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 109 and 230, n. 26.</page><page sequence="8">8 TAL ILAN that Rashi's Beruriah narrative is not a lost talmudic tradition after all, and even the talmudic Beruriah was never considered corrupt or corruptible. At the close of his analysis, Goodblatt attempts, half-heartedly, to explain how the uninteresting tannaitic Beruriah became the accomplished amoraic scholar. He claims that the existence of such a woman was impossible in second-century Palestine, but not in third- and fourth-century Jewish Babylonia, where the Talmud was composed and the talmudic traditions developed.16 In making this claim, however, Goodblatt fails to bring any other example to verify its historicity. On the other hand, Boyarin claims exactly the opposite."7 The education of women was a reality in second-century Palestine, but certainly not in sixth-century Babylonia. That these two scholars come to diametrically opposite conclusions on the strength of the same texts proves that Beruriah was probably an anomaly, not just in second-century Palestine, but in all of ancient Jewish history. In this respect one should treat Adler's overview as closer to reality. In her theory Beruriah is a fantasy and nightmare of the guilty male conscience of the rabbis.'" This explanation, even without Rashi's episode, seems more historically correct, and in fact more in keeping with Goodblatt's vision of the historical Beruriah. Rachel, the Wife of Rabbi Aqiva The traditions about Rabbi Aqiva and his self-sacrificing wife, Rachel, have been analyzed from a literary point of view in search of historical evidence by S. Safrai.19 Like Goodblatt, Safrai champions the superior quality of the Palestinian traditions on the beginnings of Rabbi Aqiva and his 16. Goodblatt, "Beruriah Traditions," pp. 84-85. 17. Boyarin, Carnal Israel, pp. 194-195. 18. Adler, "Virgin in the Brothel," p. 104. 19. S.

Noy = Scripta Hierosolymitana (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1971), vol. 22, pp. 229-232. The story of Rabbi Aqiva and his wife has been widely discussed in Hebrew. An interesting comparison of the two versions of the story in the Babylonian Talmud is found in A. Aderet, "Ha-Sipur be-Sefer ha-Agada B, Alei Siah 4-5 (1978): 122-129. A similar motif found in ancient Chinese tradition is mentioned by E. Bin-Gorion, Shevilei Aggadah (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1950), pp. 61-62. The motif is also discussed by Zipora Kagan, "Ha-Isha ha-Neemana ba-Sipur ha-Amami," Mahanaim 98 (1965): 144-149. Cf. also Yaffa Kemer, "Ha-Agadah al Rachel ve-Rabbi Aqiva," Maalot 8, no. 6 (1977): 37-40.</page><page sequence="9">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 9 wife over and against the Babylonian traditions. Three literary notes on these traditions, which Safrai ignores, will be discussed here. 1. Safrai shows that, for chronological reasons, Rabbi Aqiva's wife could not have been the daughter of Kalba Savua, the Croesus of the last days of Jerusalem. He explains this fictitious family tie as part of a greater design of the Babylonian Talmud whereby important sages are connected by marriage to one another or to other important figures of the day; thus, for example, Simeon ben Shatah is made brother to Queen Salamzion Alexandra (bBerakhot 48a), and Resh Laqish is made brother-in-law to Rabbi Yohanan (bBaba Mezia 84a).20 Although not acknowledging his indebtedness to Safrai, Goodblatt makes a similar claim regarding the historicity of Beruriah's filial relationship to Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion and marriage connection to Rabbi Meir, both mentioned explicitly only in the Babylonian Talmud. He holds that these two family relations were a fanciful invention of that composition. Further, Goodblatt not only claims that Beruriah's marriage to Rabbi Meir was fictitious, he also shows that the sources preserve the name of another, perhaps somewhat more plausible father-in-law for Rabbi Meir, a certain Ben Ziroz (yDemai 2:1, 22c; Hullin 6b).21 In this connection it is important to point out, as was already shown by L. Finkelstein,22 that the sources also mention a more historically plausible father-in-law for Rabbi Aqiva. In the Mishnah (mYadaim 3:5) a certain "Rabbi Johanan son of Joshua, Rabbi Aqiva's father-in-law" is mentioned. The likelihood that Joshua was indeed the name of Aqiva's father-in-law becomes apparent when we perceive that Rabbi Aqiva's son was also named Joshua (e.g., tKetubbot 4:7). Jewish boys were often named after their grandfathers. 2. Rabbi Aqiva's wife is often referred to as Rachel. She appears in both Talmudim as well as in both versions of Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, but she is only mentioned by name in version A of this midrash (chap. 6).23 However, the name Rachel is not recorded for women in Palestine in the entire Second Temple and mishnaic period.24 Does Avot de-Rabbi Nathan 20. Safrai, "Tales of the Sages." 21. Goodblatt, "Beruriah Traditions," pp. 76-77. 22. Finkelstein, Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr (New York: Covici, Fried, 1936), pp. 22-23. 23.

It appears</page><page sequence="10">10 TAL ILAN preserve an authentic tradition, which the other sources failed to record?25 Or is there another explanation for her name? One of the two versions of the Rabbi Aqiva and wife tradition in the Babylonian Talmud was provided with an epilogue: "Rabbi Aqiva's daughter did the same for Ben Azzai. This is what is meant by the expression: 'The sheep (rSSlm) went after the sheep (,' r),' the deeds of the daughter are like the deeds of the mother" (bKetubbot 63a).26 The Aramaic saying likens Rabbi Aqiva's wife to a sheep. The word "sheep" in Aramaic (S 'n) stems from the same root as the name Rachel. My guess is that the Aramaic saying in the Babylonian Talmud was understood by the Avot de-Rabbi Nathan as the name of the woman (or as a pun on her name). 3. This epilogue raises a discrepancy between the Palestinian and Babylo- nian traditions. We are informed here that Rabbi Aqiva's daughter did for Ben Azzai what her mother had done for her father, which, in this context, means that she married Ben Azzai but allowed him to leave her in dire poverty while he went off to study. However in Palestinian traditions (tYevamot 8.4; ySotah 1:2, 16c; Bereshit Rabbah 34:14), and even once in the Babylonian Talmud (bYevamot 63b), Ben Azzai is mentioned as the one sage in the entire Jewish academic world who remained a bachelor, since he considered marriage an obstacle to the study of Torah. Naturally, this is just another application of the for the first time on a late inscription from the Beit Shearim cemetery and in Greek. See B. Lifschitz and M. Schwabe, Beit She'arim (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1974), vol. 2, p. 94, no. 121. This Rachel also had a second, Greek name, Ourania, and apparently came from Asia Minor or, alternatively, Eilat. 25. Version A, in its final form, should be considered later than Version B, and was apparently acquainted with the Babylonian Talmud. See M. B. Lerner, "The External Tractates," in The Literature of the Sages, ed. S. Safrai = Compendia Rerum ludaicarum ad Novum Testament, sec. 2 (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1987), pp. 376-377. Cf. J.

The idea that the deeds of the sages are repeated by their students or by their children, including a discussion of Rabbi Aqiva's son and daughter, is found in J. Elbaum, "Tavniyot Lashon ve-Inyan be-Maasei Hakhamim: le-Tivan shel ha-Eduyot al Rabbi Aqiva be-Avot de-Rabbi Natan," in Divrei ha-Congress ha-Olami ha-Shevii le-Madaei ha-Yahahut (Jerusalem: World Union for Jewish Studies, 1981), vol. 3, pp. 70(-77.</page><page sequence="11">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 11 Babylonian Talmud's fancy for creating fictitious family relations between sages.27 Imma Shalom As opposed to the Beruriah and Rachel traditions, the Imma Shalom traditions have never been scrutinized by serious scholars.28 Imma Shalom has always been presented in popular anthologies on Jewish women, both before Goodblatt's article and after, as an example intended to second the claim that Beruriah was an outstanding woman scholar. In this view Imma Shalom, who was older than Beruriah, is said to have been perhaps not as accomplished, but, nevertheless, almost as compelling.29 In order to make this claim, scholars have been even less cautious than in dealing with Beruriah and have taken passages referring to Rabban Gamaliel's daughter as authentic Imma Shalom traditions (bYevamot 90b-91a, bSanhedrin 39a), although, if anything, Imma Shalom should be considered Rabban Gamaliel's sister.30 One author regards Imma Shalom's provocative academic achievements as 27. Another son-in-law of Rabbi Aqiva, Rabbi Joshua ben Qupsai, is mentioned in another section of the Babylonian Talmud (bShabbat 147a), but Rabbi Aqiva, of course, could have had two sons-in-law. 28. For example, a scholarly book about Rabbi Eliezer, Y. D. Gilat, R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus: A Scholar Outcast (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1984), mentions Imma Shalom in passing and takes it for granted that her biographical credentials are trustworthy (pp. 417, 428 n. 27, and particularly 484 n. 62). In another book on Rabbi Eliezer, J. Neusner's Eliezer ben Hyrcanus: The Tradition and the Man (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973), Imma Shalom is not mentioned except in quoted traditions. 29. Kayserling, Diejiidischen Frau, p. 124; Henry and Taitz, Written Out ofHistory, p. 47. J. Elbaum, "Demuyot Nashim be-Aggadat Hazal--Model le-Hikui," Hagut = Ha Isha be-Mekorot ha-Yahadut (Jerusalem: Israel Ministry of Education, 1983), p. 26, mentions Beruriah together with Imma Shalom and Rachel, Aqiva's wife. One writer, L. Swidler, however, attempted the opposite. He claimed that Imma Shalom had not achieved scholarly greatness, as compared to Beruriah, who had, and thus she only proved Beruriah's uniqueness. See L. Swidler, Women in Judaism: The Status of Women in Formative Judaism (Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1976), p. 104. 30. See Zirndorf, Some Jewish Women, pp. 142-144; S. Mendelsohn, s.v.

Three of them ap- pear only in the Babylonian Talmud (bShabbat 116a, bNedarim 20a-b, bBaba Mezia 49b). One tradition is tannaitic (Sifra Shemini Mekhilta deMiluim 2:32-33),32 although it has parallels in the Palestinian amoraic literature (ySheviit 6:1, 36c; yGittin 1:2, 43c; Leviticus Rabbah 20:6;33 Pesiqta deRav Kahana34) and in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 63a). Following Goodblatt's model, I shall first analyze the tannaitic tradition. 1. The tannaitic tradition. In the Sifra, the Imma Shalom tradition is found in the chapter discussing Leviticus 10, where the sons of Aaron the Priest die while sacrificing in the Sanctuary against God's desire. The sages wonder why the sons of Aaron had to die, and a contemporary story is presented to illustrate one suggestion. It happened concerning a certain student who instructed in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer. He commented to Imma Shalom his wife: I wonder if he will survive the week. And he did not survive the week [i.e., he died within the week]. Sifra Shemini Mekhilta de Miluim 99:5 This is the only tannaitic (and indeed Palestinian) tradition mentioning Imma Shalom. What can be gleaned about her from this earliest stratum? It is obvious that Imma Shalom was the name of Rabbi Eliezer's wife. The woman is totally passive in the story, although it is to her that Rabbi Eliezer comments about the fate of his student, perhaps reflecting a certain degree of intimacy between them. Rabbi Eliezer's wife is mentioned once more in tannaitic literature, although not by name. In the Tosefta we read: "All those [pubescent girls] who are inspected are inspected only by women. Thus did Rabbi Eliezer instruct his wife" (tNiddah 6:8, cf. bNiddah 48b). From this source it is clear that Rabbi Eliezer used his wife's services in order to determine whether girls 31. S. I.

If this text refers to the same woman as the one above, the intimacy we noted in the previous text is further substantiated. 2. The Babylonian amoraic traditions. Aside from a parallel to the above- mentioned tannaitic tradition (bEruvin 63a), Imma Shalom is mentioned three more times in the Babylonian Talmud. Of the three traditions, one is related in Hebrew (bNedarim 20a-b) and the two others in Aramaic (bShabbat 116a, bBaba Mezia 49b). I shall begin by examining the Hebrew tradition. In Nedarim the sages ask Imma Shalom how her sons come to be so good-looking. Imma Shalom answers rather boldly, describing how her husband has sexual intercourse with her: "Not at the beginning of the night and not at the end of the night. . . . he reveals a portion and covers another, and appears as though possessed by a demon" (bNedarim 49b).35 For our survey this source is of little value. Imma Shalom's words are presented by amoraim as a prooftext for a statement made by the tanna Rabbi Yohanan ben Dehebai, and although the usual formula representing a tannaitic baraita is absent at its head, the tradition could, nevertheless, be considered tannaitic, due to its Hebrew. The name of Imma Shalom's husband is not mentioned in the source.36 Additional evidence regarding Imma Shalom's biography is found in the two Aramaic traditions of the Babylonian Talmud. Both traditions begin by stating that Imma Shalom, the wife of Rabbi Eliezer, was Rabban Gamaliel's sister. The information about Rabbi Eliezer's brother-in-law is totally absent from the tannaitic and Palestinian sources, although Rabban Gamaliel was certainly a popular tannaitic figure. Thus, here too the Babylonian Talmud is creating a fictitious marriage with which to bind important sages together. Only in bBaba Mezia does the dual family relationship of Imma Shalom play an integral part in the tradition. The story is an Aramaic epilogue to the Hebrew (tannaitic?) narrative of the ban imposed on Rabbi Eliezer by Rabban Gamaliel and the academy at Yavneh. 35. This source reveals a unique paradox: although the sexual behavior it describes supposedly displays a high level of piety and modesty (cf. Gilat, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, p. 484, n. 62), detailed descriptions of sexual practices like this one are altogether rare in rabbinic literature, most likely because of their indiscreet nature. 36. In bBerakhot 3a, Rabbi Eliezer recommends sexual intercourse between husband and wife in the middle of the night, as described here by Imma Shalom. Either this source generated the story about Imma Shalom or the story about Imma Shalom generated this attribution to Rabbi Eliezer, or both sources existed simultaneously, indicating that they contain a grain of truth. I suspect that one of the first two reconstructions is the correct one.</page><page sequence="14">14 TAL ILAN Imma Shalom, Rabbi Eliezer's wife, was Rabban Gamaliel's sister. From the time of this incident onwards she did not permit him to fall upon his face. Now a certain day ... a poor man came and stood at the door, and she took out some bread to him. [On her return] she found [Rabbi Eliezer] fallen on his face. She said to him: Arise, you have slain my brother. Meanwhile an announcement was made from the House of Rabban Gamaliel that he had died. [Rabbi Eliezer] questioned her: How did you know it? I have this tradition from my father's house, all gates are locked except the gates of wounded feeling. (bBaba Mezia 59b) This story is about Rabbi Eliezer's appeal to heaven to be his judge in his disagreement with Rabban Gamaliel. But Imma Shalom forbids him to pray, since she fears rightly that if Rabbi Eliezer's grievances reach heaven, her brother would perish. This epilogue has a distinctly legendary quality. It is absent from the parallel tradition, relating the imposition of the ban on Rabbi Eliezer, in the Palestinian Talmud (yMo 'ed Qatan 3:1, 81c-d). Imma Shalom's hostile attitude to her husband is also a new element. The tradition in tractate Shabbat also begins by stating Imma Shalom's dual family ties, but her marriage to Rabbi Eliezer is totally irrelevant to the narrative. Imma Shalom, the wife of Rabbi Eliezer, was Rabban Gamaliel's sister. There was once a philosopher (XD101~) in their neighborhood, who gained a name for himself for not accepting bribes. They came to mock him. She brought him a golden lamp and presented herself before him. She said: I inherited property of the house of the nasi [i.e., her family]. He said to them: Divide it. He said to him: It is written to us: "Where there is a son, a daughter shall not inherit." He said to him: From the day that you have been exiled from your land, the Law of Moses has been withdrawn and another book has been introduced in which it is written: "A son and a daughter shall inherit equally." Next day he [Rabban Gamaliel] brought him a Libyan ass. He said to them: I have cast my eyes at the end of the book and it is written there, "I have not come to add to the Law of Moses" (Matthew 5:7). And it is written there: "Where there is a son, a daughter shall not inherit." She said to him: Your wisdom shines like a lamp. He said to him: An ass came and kicked the lamp. (bShabbat 116a-b) The philosopher in the story is evidently a Christian, as his reference to a nearly exact quotation from the New Testament indicates. The role of Rabban</page><page sequence="15">THE HISTORICAL BERURIAH, RACHEL, AND IMMA SHALOM 15 Gamaliel and his sister in this story is twofold: discrediting the integrity of the judge and discrediting Christianity. Four literary stages can be discerned in this tradition. At first there existed a saying, "The ass has kicked the lamp," which referred in some way or another to the acceptance of a bribe. This stage is found, for example, in the Palestinian Talmud: "The years of the wicked shall be short" (Proverbs 10:27). This refers to priests who served in the Second Temple. There was the case of one who sent his son with two weights of silver and leveling-rods of silver. And another came and sent his son with two weights of gold and leveling-rods of gold. They said: "The ass has upset the lamp." (yYoma 1:1, 38c) The saying is found here without any explanation, although the fact that it referred to bribery can be inferred from the context. Obviously, it was a common idiom at the time, understood by all, but now, alas, lost. The origin of this saying was also seemingly lost quite early, because there soon appeared a story to explain it, about a corrupt judge who rules against a woman in distress because her adversary is much wealthier. The story is constructed around this pessimistic saying. It appears in an anonymous form in a Palestinian tradition: Said Rabbi Levi: There was the case of a woman who bribed a judge with a silver lamp. Her adversary went and bribed him with a golden ass. The next day she came to court and discovered that the decree in her favor had been reversed. She said to him: My lord, does my silver lamp not radiate from you? He said to her: The golden ass came and overturned the silver lamp. (Pesiqta deRav Kahana, Lamentation 9).37 All the characters in the narrative are anonymous, but it is obvious that this story served as the basis for the Babylonian Talmud's narrative about Imma Shalom and Rabban Gamaliel. Another stage of the story's development must have been the introduction of the anti-Christian element. Instead of a lawsuit of no relevance to the story, the issue under discussion is the inheritance of women. According to Jewish 37. B. Mandelbaum ed., pp. 260-261.</page><page sequence="16">16 TAL ILAN law, daughters did not inherit their fathers,38 but among the neighboring peoples the Jews met cultures where women did inherit.39 Christianity had to decide which of these bodies of law to adopt. Obviously, the compiler who introduced the anti-Christian element into the story was not of the opinion that Jewish law was just with regard to the inheritance of daughters, since he puts the words of the injured party here in the mouth of the woman. It is probable that a strong anti-Christian polemic would have been composed in Palestine, where Christians were a real problem for Jews, rather than in Babylonia, where they constituted only an academic question. However, there is no Palestinian or other evidence for this in the narrative, and it can only be gleaned from the last stage of the story's development that is available in the Babylonian Talmud. In this stage, too, the identities of Imma Shalom and Rabban Gamaliel are superfluous. Any brother and sister could equally well have discredited the new dicta of Christianity.40 In the last stage irony is introduced. The brethren are not real rivals. The sister accepts and reveres Jewish law. She is only party to a practical joke played on the Christian judge. Although the frame of the two previous stages is maintained, their point is almost totally lost. The story no longer narrates the predicament of a poor woman facing a corrupt judge, nor the injustice in Jewish law pertaining to daughters inheriting. Discrediting Christianity is now the only aim of the story. However, even for this purpose, the identity of the adversaries is not vital. I therefore conclude that here, too, the Babylonian Talmud added a historical identity to the characters in order to make the story more gossipy and entertaining. To sum up, Imma Shalom is mentioned in the tannaitic sources as Rabbi Eliezer's wife. In the Babylonian Talmud she became Rabban Gamaliel's sister. The difference between the two groups of sources can be solved by as- suming that the Babylonian Talmud created an imaginary family relationship between two important contemporary sages. 38.

Two repeated literary practices make the historicity of the narratives suspect, and thus render the Babylonian Talmud's account of these women unreliable. These are: (1) The creation of fictitious family relationships between the sages, and between sages and important personages of their day; sometimes, when scanned thoroughly, the sources yield alternative family relationships which contradict these. (2) Anonymous characters mentioned in literary compositions, in the form of a moral tale found in the Palestinian aggadic corpus, and sometimes even in the Babylonian Talmud itself, are replaced in the Babylonian Talmud with historical characters, in order to transform them into fictitious historical events. These two criteria probably would serve just as well to discredit and cast doubt on talmudic stories in which men are the central figures, but I have chosen to concentrate on the women stories because, in their scarcity, they have more often been treated as historically trustworthy documents.</page></plain_text>
