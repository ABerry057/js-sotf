<plain_text><page sequence="1">HE SAID, SHE SAID: A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO by RENEi LEVINE MELAMMED Rabbinic responsa can at times furnish an entree into the private and public lives of individuals involved with the judicial system. The case under discussion provides an in-depth portrait of a marriage in twelfth-century Cairo and of a woman's life-in this instance, a woman struggling to maneuver within the strictures of Jewish law and contemporary Judeo-Arabic society.' The original Judeo-Arabic of the two responsa under discussion, as well as the Hebrew translations, are, no doubt, well known to Judeo-Arabic, Geniza, and Maimonidean scholars alike, as are the basic details to some English These texts were first brought to my attention by my husband, Uri Melammed, who had studied them with Professor Joshua Blau in a course in Judeo-Arabic; he graciously passed on his knowledge to me. I used the Hebrew version in class for some years, but then found an English version necessary for use in the American classroom. I could not have completed it without the aid of my husband, who diligently checked every word of the original responsa and later pored over the entire article with his usual thoroughness and precision; my heartfelt thanks to my partner. I must also thank my pedagogic partner, Ross S. Kraemer, with whom I co-taught a course on women in Jewish history at Franklin and Marshall College. This translation was prepared for that class. She encouraged me to write up the material for publication, but I procrastinated until I was strongly urged to do so by Seth Ward as well. The first draft was read by David Kraemer, who checked the rabbinic sources, and also by Ross S. Kraemer, who made many helpful comments. 1. This is what S. D. Goitein terms Geniza society in A Mediterranean Society, 5 vols. (Berkeley, Calif., 1967-88). The responsa treated in this article are from the Cairo Geniza collection.

Responsa have always presented certain difficulties as a source of social history, and these Maimonidean documents are no exception to the rule.3 Precise dating is difficult, although it is known that the questions in the two responsa treated in this article were presented to the Beth Din between 1167 and 1204.4 There is no information available concerning the anonymous individuals involved other than what emerges in the context of the legal presentation.' A marital conflict was clearly the central issue, and as a result the husband requested and received a ruling. The case became quite unusual once the wife decided to ask for a ruling on "her" situation, which, as will be 2. The best-known edition of these responsa appears in a collection that displays the original Judeo-Arabic alongside Hebrew translations. See Joshua Blau, Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, 4 vols. (Jerusalem, 1957-86), vol. 1, pp. 49-53, 71-73. The corrected Judeo-Arabic edition appears in idem, Judaeo-Arabic Literature: Selected Texts (Jerusalem, 1980), pp. 223-228. Blau based his readings on MS Simonsen B in the Royal Library of Copenhagen; see entry for David J. Simonsen in Benjamin Richler, Guide to Hebrew Manuscript Collections (Jerusalem, 1994), p. 176. The dating of these copies is difficult and uncertain, and might be as late as the fourteenth century; for a discussion of the collection as well as the dating, see Blau, Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 3, pp. 3-6. They, together with a Hebrew translation, were also found in abbreviated form in the A. H. Freimann collection (Jerusalem, 1934). Heretofore these texts have not been available to the English reader, although a summary of them appears in Goitein, Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, pp. 344-346. An annotated translation will appear in Joel Kraemer's forthcoming collection of translated works of Maimonides in the Yale Judaica Series. 3. One often has to take into account the fact that most (published) responsa were edited, and in the process details that might have helped to recreate or enrich the social or historical context were sometimes edited out. In addition, when copies were made, there was always the pitfall of human error on the part of the scribe. "The copyists were infamous for deleting all of the data which they considered halakhically irrelevant, exactly that information which the social historian finds most meaningful." Mordechai A. Friedman, "Responsa of R. Abraham Maimonides from the Cairo Geniza: A Preliminary Review," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 56 (1990): 32. See also the comments in the (unpaginated) introduction to Blau, Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 1, about translators not including certain details. 4. Maimonides was born in 1138 and died in 1204; hence the latest possible date for the responsa. 5. Needless to say, there once must have been documents that would have been of great use, such as the marriage contract, perhaps a divorce writ, property ownership papers, wills, and the like, but none were found or identified among the Geniza fragments and papers. Some may no longer have existed, for papers were often discarded after the conditions of a divorce were carried out.</page><page sequence="3">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 21 demonstrated, was substantially at odds with the situation described earlier by her husband.6 However, in order to enable a fuller understanding of the situation, an English translation of both responsa will precede any further comments or analysis. Responsum 457 QUESTION Our rabbi will teach us concerning [an incident whereby] a Jew had a wife who had been with him for a number of years. And in one of these years, he happened to take a trip in connection with personal matters and for business reasons, and he was absent from his city on and off for four years.8 When he returned home afterwards, he found that his brother-in-law, his wife's brother, had become a teacher of children; and his wife, the brother-in-law's sister, was sitting with him and teaching the children; this was due to the fact that her husband had taught her some Torah and she had learned the rest [of the Torah] while her husband was absent. Her husband said to her: "It is not at all proper for you to teach [these] children, for I fear that their fathers, who will come to visit the children, and you will be in an embarrassing position because of 6. D. H. Baneth thought that it was the wife's relatives rather than the wife who turned to the court; see note on Arabic text, Blau, Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 1, p. 71, and Judaeo-Arabic Literature, p. 223, n. 1. However, the Geniza documents make it clear that women frequently appeared in court (except the rather wealthy ones); thus it cannot be assumed that she could not have been the petitioner. 7. Each responsum in Teshuvot Ha-Rambam was assigned a number according to the order in which it appeared in the manuscripts; while the second responsum is number 34 (and 52 in the manuscript), it was presented to Maimonides sometime after the question numbered 45 (no. 63 in the manuscript). Scholars have assumed that the interval between the two was a matter of years; Baneth estimated that it was "a few years," Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 1, p. 71, and Goitein assumed that the lawsuit "probably went on for some time," Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, p. 345. Brackets are used to insert words that make it easier to understand the text but were not part of the original. 8. Goitein wrote that "absenteeism of the husband was the most widespread cancer of marital life as known to us from the Geniza." Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, p. 155.</page><page sequence="4">22 RENEE LEVINE MELAMMED them,9 and I do not want this, neither for my sake nor for your sake."'1 And when the aforementioned wife heard this from him, she irritated him by refraining from doing her duties--those which the daughters of Israel must perform for their husbands: kneading and cooking and making the bed and cleaning the house; washing clothes and fulfilling her duties to her sons-but she persisted in teaching the children at her brother's from morning until evening. And if it happened that he needed something for his own needs, to cook or to knead or to launder or the like, he had to hire someone who would come and satisfy these needs, paying the full cost. The man and woman continued this way for four years, and he is now weary of it. This woman has part-ownership jointly with her sister and her mother-in-law, the mother of her husband; and he is afraid to divorce her, lest she take the aforementioned portion and sell it, and, as a result, the sons he had with her will be destitute, for she will give it to a different husband. And this woman has [it] written in her ketubba [marriage contract] concerning her husband: "He may not wed another woman, and he may not allow a maid- servant whom she despises to stay with him. And if he should marry another, or if he permits a maidservant whom she despises to stay with him, he takes it upon himself to pay [her] the me'uhar [delayed marriage payment]" in full and to write her [a bill of divorce], [so] that 9. This word is also translated as "exposed" rather than "embarrassing"; see Y. Qafih's comment in Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 3, p. 120. 10. Goitein pointed out that in B.T., Kiddushin (4:13) 82a, it is written that bachelors and women may not teach. He stressed Maimonides' addition to this restriction in Mishneh Torah, Study of Torah 2:4, whereby the bachelor's limitation is because of the mothers who would bring their sons to class, and the women's limitation is because of the fathers. Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, p. 504, n. 155. 11. According to a custom that began in the gaonic period, several payments were involved in marriage contracts, each being made at a different time. The mohar was the (cash) payment by the groom before the marriage. The additional payment was divided into two parts, the muqdam and the me 'uhar. The muqdam was usually made immediately after the wedding, but could be given any time between the making of the match and the wedding. The me'uhar or delayed marriage payment, was given to the wife if her husband died or if a divorce occurred. Thus it served as a guarantee of support if the husband decided to divorce the wife without cause. See the discussion in S. D. Goitein's Hebrew article, "The Position of the Woman According to the Geniza Writings," Proceedings of the Fourth World Congress of Jewish Studies B (Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 177-179, and in greater depth in M.

And make clear to us what the requirement [of the law] is in regard to every single issue as an absolute answer; may your compensation be doubled. ANSWER He may not make a second marriage unless he has her [the first wife's] permission or unless he redeems the me'uhar. And he may prevent her from teaching the children, and the court is required to admonish her and to deter her from doing this. If she sues for divorce because her husband prevents her from teaching, her request will not be granted; on the contrary, all doors are locked before her and all paths are to be obstructed, and her affairs will be delayed for as long as it takes until she withdraws and agrees to behave properly toward her husband. Thus wrote Moshe. Responsum 34 QUESTION: Concerning a man who married a nine-year-old and she had a portion in common property with her mother-in-law and her [own] into Immediate and Postponed Payments in the Geniza Documents" [Heb.] Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress of Jewish Studies, vol. 3 (1977), pp. 377-387. 12. This clause is extremely interesting, and has been discussed by various scholars. The earliest known "monogamy clause" is dated to 1125/26 and is included among a number of conditions in the marriage document. See Mark R. Cohen, Jewish Self-Government in Medieval Egypt (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1980), p. 257. Many Geniza marriage contracts from this period have such clauses; see Mordechai A. Friedman, "The Monogamy Clause in Jewish Marriage Contracts," Perspectives in Jewish Learning 4 (1972): 20-40.

The mother of the aforesaid man obligated herself in writing to support the aforesaid woman for ten years, and did support her for seven years. And after those seven years, the aforementioned mother-in-law said to her: "I am unable to support you [plural]." And the husband does not have enough [to support her] even for an hour, and he supported her for two months. The young girl became pregnant and gave birth to a male child. And when he [the husband] saw that it was difficult for him to support the household, he left the child with its mother when it was nine months old, and he traveled and was absent for three years in the Land of Israel and in Damascus and elsewhere, and he did not even leave her anything to eat for dinner that very evening, not for her and not for the baby. And when he returned from his journey he had nothing of value on his person. The clerk who collects the head tax [entry tax] caught him, for he did not have the half-dirhem to pay it, until his father paid it for him.'3 And his aforementioned wife and his mother had to pay the poll tax for him, for fear he would be taken to jail; and he entered the courtyard and is completely destitute. He stayed in the city for two years. The wife became pregnant and gave birth to another son. And he [the father] left him with her when he was a year and a half, and returned to traveling a second time, and he did not leave her with even an hour's worth [of support] and disappeared for another three years. The aforesaid woman's age became twenty-five years [old], and she was in utter degradation from poverty, with two sons whose hunger outweighed their satiation. And all the time that she was with him, he did not provide her with oil for light, not during the week or on the Sabbath or on the holidays; and she could never benefit from the light of a lamp unless she entered his mother's home or his brother's home, since she lives with them in the courtyard. And she was "burned out" by the poverty and the terrible situation [in which she found herself]. And she has a brother who teaches children Bible, and the woman has knowledge of the Bible. She asked her brother to let her teach the children Bible with him, so that she would have a means of sustaining 13. The Arabic word translated as "father" is not clear in the manuscript. Blau points out that it could easily have been the word for "brother"; see Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 1, p. 49, n. 3.</page><page sequence="7">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 25 herself and her sons, since she was already near to death from the misery in which she was enveloped, and he [the husband] was absent. And he [the husband] returned from his travels and found her teaching children Bible at her brother's. And she had been teaching the children with her brother for six years. Later, as it happened, her brother went on a journey. She sat in his place and received the children and taught them Bible, and continued so doing for four years. Her firstborn son grew, and when his age was seventeen years, she took him with her to teach Bible for the aforementioned four years in her brother's stead, so as to talk with the men whose sons [were studying] with her, and she was [there] for the women coming to get their children. And since the day the aforementioned sons were born, their father never paid the poll tax for them or their school fees'4 for the House of Torah study, nor did he did clothe them at all, neither clothing nor turban nor a shoe for their feet. And the woman was under his authority twenty-five years, and he never bought a mat to spread out under them but once, and did not buy a bed-covering or pillow or any household goods; even the linseed oil that she lights, if she did not buy it on her own, she would never have been able to light a lamp. Neither she nor the children have had any pleasure from him, not even verbally, except for curses and foul language. He told her: "Either live in your house like everyone else or give me the right to wed [another woman]." The aforesaid woman said to him: "I am sick and tired of poverty, which I had at first, and my sons and I have only been able to survive since the day I began teaching the children." And she said to him: "If you want a divorce, I will release you and not detain you. But let you marry [another woman]?! I shall never do that!" 14. This term is also unclear; the Arabic word is khamis. Baneth thought that fees were customarily paid on Thursdays, which would explain the reference to five or the fifth day, Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 1, p. 50, n. 4. Goitein confirmed this when he wrote that Thursday was the day on which fees were normally paid; see Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, p. 188. A similar usage of a different term is found in the well-established Sephardi community in Jerusalem. The first line of Psalm 81, recited on Thursdays, is "Sing joyously to God, our strength; raise a shout for the God of Jacob." The first word, harnenu ("sing joyously"), came to signify the day that would bring joy to the Torah teacher because he would receive his weekly salary and thus be able to purchase food for the Sabbath. See David Benveniste, Hebrew Words in Judeo-Spanish [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1984), p. 31.</page><page sequence="8">26 RENEE LEVINE MELAMMED Despite the fact that he is at his mother's day and night, and if he buys something for a pittance, it is for him and his mother, and his wife knows nothing of it; later he complains to everyone in the city that she [the wife] is not fulfilling his needs and is not sleeping at home. She told him: "We have no need of such shame; come, I will take you from your mother's. I will not prevent you from sleeping at home. And if you want, come and live with me at the school, rent out the portion that is mine in the partnership with your mother and my sister, and take the rent for yourself, for I am split in two courtyards [i.e., I have property in one courtyard but rent in another] and pay fourteen dirhem rent to the school; " and I get no profit from the part that is mine in the courtyard, not for the apartment nor for the rent, in that I forfeit my profit from it out of generosity to you and your mother." He said to her: "I will not rent it, and I will not take the rent, but you will either live in your house like the rest of the daughters of Israel or grant me the right to marry another." Later he made a pretext and said to her: "I will borrow a dinar and buy you wheat, and you will sit [live] at home." She said to him: "My living is not like other professions, so that I can pick it up again tomorrow if I abandon it today. If I abandon my students even for one day, I will not find them when I return and seek them out, for their parents will take them to other schools. And the people do not bring their children to the aforesaid older son, but [come] because of me, for he is but a lad. And the two aforementioned sons have no trade in which to work except Torah study. And if I discontinue teaching the children, I shall lose the children and there will be no wheat [bread],16 and you will travel and go off as is your custom, and I will remain, the boys and I, and we will be lost, for they have no trade." Holy eminence, may the Lord glorify you: Does she have to leave her profession and return to [what she had] in the beginning? And does she have to fulfill his needs and serve him, when he does not provide her with food or drink or clothes and does not do a thing for her that is 15. This passage gives us some idea of the value of the dirhem. Earlier it was said that the husband did not have the half-dirhem necessary to pay his tax; here we see that a half-dirhem would have been one twenty-eighth of a month's rent, clearly a pittance. 16. According to S. Abramson, this reference is to the Hebrew word for "flour," in this case meaning "food," rather than the Arabic word for "wheat." See Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 3, p. 154.</page><page sequence="9">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH--CENTURY CAIRO 27 said in the Torah?'7 And is she required to give him permission to marry [another woman]? And inform us, what is the legal obligation in all that is written above? Make it clear to us, as we have been accustomed to your mercy. May your compensation be doubled from heaven. ANSWER The law'8 requires that the husband be forced to satisfy his wife's needs, such as clothes and expenses and the like [other obligations], and this is what he must do; and if he is prevented [from doing so] or is unable, he is forced [by the court] to divorce her and pay the me 'uhar, if he has it. And the husband may prevent his wife from teaching a craft or reading.'9 And the way of circumvention for this woman, if her words are words of truth, is for her to "rebel"20 and leave without the me 'uhar; and he is then forced [by the rabbinic court] to divorce her and she will be her own woman, [free to] teach whomever she pleases and do whatever she pleases. And thus wrote Moshe. Without a doubt, the two petitioners tell quite different stories.21 Yet it is clear that the two stories deal with the same family and situation: the time, place, and complementary and overlapping details of each version are 17. These duties are only alluded to briefly in the Torah. See Exodus 21:10, where three obligations are specified: food, clothing, and sexual obligations. 18. In addition to the three obligations listed in the Torah, seven more are specified in the rabbinic sources. See Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Marriage 12:1-2. 19. This contention provided the basis of the first response. 20. This is the translation of the term moredet, designating a rebellious woman who refuses to engage in sexual relations with her husband. When a wife behaved in this manner, this gave the husband acceptable grounds for divorce; the wife's ketubba would be reduced weekly until nothing remained, at which time she could be divorced, unable to claim her ketubba. See B.T., Ketubbot (5:7) 63a. The husband also has conjugal duties to his wife (ibid. 61b), and if he "rebels," an addition is made to his wife's ketubba (ibid. 63a). 21. It must be pointed out that these petitions were not made personally, but through intermediaries, legal representatives, rabbis, judges, or halakhically knowledgeable individuals; this was the normal practice and does not necessarily mean that the petitioner was illiterate or able to read but not write. The representative formulated the petition, hopefully to the benefit of the petitioner, sometimes recording everything and other times editing, reformulating, or even shortening the query as he deemed fit. The final form of the petition was tailored to present the picture the representative considered to be most beneficial to his client's case.</page><page sequence="10">28 RENEE LEVINE MELAMMED far more than mere coincidence.22 While each side only presented facts that supported its own contention, the husband obviously limited the information he volunteered to an absolute minimum so as to emphasize the details that might help him to get the ruling he wanted. One is immediately impressed by the amount of traveling in which members of this family engaged. Both the husband and the brother were quite mobile, with the former taking numerous and rather lengthy trips.23 As a matter of fact, these travels are one of the first details related by the husband. The first issue raised by the wife is the fact that she and her husband's family own property in common. This situation probably provided the initial impetus for the marriage. Both parties mention the property as an important factor, and later on the wife offers to let the husband rent her property as a source of income. The husband claimed that a divorce was not a feasible option because he wanted to protect his sons' inheritance rights, but aside from this statement there is no evidence that he ever displayed any concern for them or their welfare. The next issue concerns the wife's means of supporting herself and her sons. In her husband's absence, she studied Torah and joined her brother as a teacher. When her husband returned, he was perturbed by this development and contended that the wife's occupation was outside the bounds of modesty expected of a married woman, for she inevitably had to have contact with the fathers of her pupils; this was entirely unacceptable to him. One naturally wonders whether teaching was a common profession for women in this society. There is little evidence available, aside from a reference to female teachers in eleventh-century Cairo as well as a synagogue known as the "Synagogue of the Women Teachers," where reading and writing were taught 22. While the anonymity of the responsa may cast a shadow of doubt here, it is very unlikely that two different families in the same area would simultaneously have had such similar lives (i.e., travel details, family size, occupations, property ownership, family structure, financial situation, etc.). Blau first wrote that Question 34 had a certain similarity to Question 45, although Baneth believed that the same husband and wife were involved in both cases; see Teshuvot Ha-Rambam, vol. 3, p. 71. Goitein never doubted the fact that the same couple was struggling with these issues; Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, pp. 344-346. 23. This is compatible with Goitein's description of this society as being extremely mobile, with mobility not being limited solely to the wealthy. See Mediterranean Society, vol. 1, pp. 42-59.</page><page sequence="11">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 29 to children aged four through thirteen.24 But this makes it evident that the wife in this case was not the only Jewish woman in the Islamic world to have chosen a career in education. According to the husband, the wife reacted badly to his objections. Since she refused to do her wifely duties, he was compelled to hire other women in order to obtain the numerous services normally performed by a wife. Finally he decided to take a second wife, but here he encountered legal barriers. He included the clause from their marriage contract in full in the original Aramaic, and as can be seen, it granted the wife final say should he desire to marry a second wife or take a concubine.25 In short, he could not do so without her permission; if she objected and he still wanted the other woman, he would have to divorce her and provide the appropriate payment. The husband claimed that he wanted to marry a second wife rather than get a divorce so that the property would remain in the family. Maimonides' first reply was a straightforward legal response formulated on the basis of the circumstances described by the husband's representative. He ruled that the clause in the marriage contract concerning a second wife was binding, but that the husband could obtain a court injunction for his wife to cease the teaching activities to which he objected. He agreed that her behavior seemed to be unacceptable, and said that if she were to request a divorce, it should not be granted. The second document, which presents the wife's version of the situation, gives a much more detailed picture, beginning with the facts that she had been married at the age of nine and that her mother-in-law had not kept her promise to support the young couple. When the husband absented himself for three years, leaving his wife with a nine-month-old infant, he did not provide for his family in any way. Upon his return home, he was unable to pay his own entry tax or poll tax, for he was virtually penniless.26 24. See Jacques Hassoun, "Un Judaisme au feminin," Les nouveaus cahiers 86 (Autumn 1986): 7; these women were specifically referred to as mu 'allimdt, the feminine plural form of the Arabic for "teacher." 25. Polygamy was an accepted practice in Oriental and Sephardi communities even after Ashkenazi Jewry had complied with the ban against it decreed by R. Gershom ben Judah (960-1028) of Germany. 26. Various taxes, such as the entry tax, were incumbent upon all residents of Moslem lands; certain others, such as the poll tax, were paid only by members of tolerated religions (dhimmi), i.e., Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians.</page><page sequence="12">30 RENEE LEVINE MELAMMED Two years after the husband's return, the couple had a second son. Less than two years later, the husband again set forth on a journey. This one lasted three years, and during this time, as before, he did not provide for his family in any way. The document stresses that he never once paid his family's taxes or the children's school fees, and did not clothe, feed, or otherwise provide for them in any way whatsoever for twenty-five years. Only after the description of the family's economic plight is there any mention of the wife's need to obtain employment. In his account the husband claimed to have taught his wife "some Bible," although apparently not enough to enable her to teach professionally. However, the wife says nothing about having learned the rudiments from her husband. Perhaps he was trying to take credit for her accomplishments, or perhaps he blamed himself for having opened the door to her, but since she does not corroborate his claim, it may not even be true.27 The wife, who was renting a room at the school, refused to abandon either her place of residence or her job and return home, and the husband, living with his mother, refused to rent his wife's property for his own profit, insisting that he wanted a wife, either his first or a second, living with him. While the wife was willing to divorce him, she declared that she would never permit him to marry anyone else while he was still married to her. The husband's desire to take a second wife seems to have stemmed from his hope of having a woman to attend to his personal needs, since his wife was not satisfactorily performing the expected duties. Because the marriage contract very clearly prohibited the husband from taking a second woman into his home against his wife's wishes, there was no chance of a rabbinic decision in his favor on this count. While the husband was quick to point out his wife's failure to perform her wifely duties, the second responsum turns the whole situation upside down.28 The husband's duties seem to have been more weighty than the wife's, for as the breadwinner he was responsible for supporting her and the children. The 27. The husband's statement is usually taken at face value; Goitein remarked that "she had made good use of her loafer of a husband," Mediterranean Society, vol. 3, p. 345. 28. Discussions of the duties of husband to wife and of wife to husband are interspersed throughout the fifth chapter of tractate Ketubbot of the Babylonian Talmud. For example, there is a list of the kinds of work that a woman must perform for her husband (fol. 59b). An example of the husband's obligations emerges in a discussion of the duties incumbent upon a man who maintains his wife through a trustee (see fol. 64b). This list mentions many of the items included above by the wife.</page><page sequence="13">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 31 wife's detailed, heartrending description of the poverty and neglect which she and her sons had struggled to overcome clearly outweighs any complaints by the husband that she was not performing her duties to his satisfaction. As already pointed out, both complainants chose their words carefully, and it was in the husband's interest to say only what would strengthen his case. In order to justify her devotion to teaching and her refusal to give up her job, the wife explains that students came to study with her specifically because of her reputation and availability. Nevertheless, if she were to absent herself, thereby disrupting their course of study, their parents would seek another teacher. The consequence of any interruption was inevitable: she would lose her income, the only means available for supporting her family. In addition, neither of her sons was trained for any other trade. While her older son assisted her, it was because of her qualifications, and not his presence, that parents brought their children to the school. The situation outlined above involves two issues: modesty and the ac- ceptability of a woman acting as a teacher. The propriety of a man and a woman being alone together is discussed in the Talmud: "A man may not be alone with two women, but one woman may be alone with two men.""29 In the case discussed in the question, where parents accompanied their children to the school, the husband alleged, in effect, that his wife might often be alone with the father of one or another of her pupils, an unacceptable and immodest situation. However, in her presentation, the wife points out that her elder son is present at the school specifically in order to serve as the second man when she had to meet with a pupil's father, and thus no compromising situation would arise. This leaves us with the question of the acceptability of a woman's teaching Torah. Before commenting upon the legal aspects, we must note that if any objections to the wife's teaching had ever been raised in the community in which she lived, they had not been strong enough to deter her. We may assume that the local parents did not object to a woman teacher, since if they had, they could have taken their children to another school. The fact that other schools were available is evident from the wife's claim that she could not leave her post without losing her clientele. It is apparent from all this that she was a competent teacher with a good reputation, and, by the time 29. B.T., Kiddushin (4:12), 80b. Implicit in this statement is the assumption that it was unacceptable at any time for a man and a woman who were not married to one another to be together while unaccompanied.</page><page sequence="14">32 RENE'i LEVINE MELAMMED she appeared before the court, was no newcomer to teaching. While Geniza society boasted some unusual women in other professions, no other women teachers have materialized as yet in the documents.30 Nevertheless, the fact that the wife was functioning as a teacher with no mention of any protest (her husband excluded) attests to the high level of tolerance in this medieval society as well as to her obvious competence. Because the Talmud objects to single men and women acting as teachers,3' Maimonides twice stated that a husband may prevent his wife from teaching a craft or reading, and in his first decision informed the husband that he could prevent her from teaching. He strengthened his ruling by pointing out that the wife would have no grounds to sue for divorce if the husband carried out this injunction, and the court would support his actions to the point of admonishing as well as deterring the wife. This decision was made on the basis of a strict reading of the law in the light of the information provided by the husband, which, as we have seen, was incomplete and, as a result, misleading. The question that arises is whether Maimonides actually objected to a woman teaching. In the responsum, he said that the husband "may" prevent his wife, but not that the wife was forbidden to engage in teaching or that the husband was required to prevent her. In discussing Maimonides' overall stance regarding women studying texts, W. Z. Harvey claims that he "does require them [women] to study Written Torah and Oral Torah (and even perhaps to be 'expert' in these disciplines) with the immediate purpose of attaining hokhmah, that is, with the immediate purpose of entering the Pardes," namely, to attain eternal life.32 While this does not address the issue of teaching directly enough for the purposes at hand, it does shed some light on Maimonides' inclinations. Now we need to look again at the questions and replies in these responsa. The husband asked if he could take a second wife and what the law advises in this matter. Maimonides does not stray from the clause in the couple's 30. See n. 24 above for mention of women teachers. The best-known woman in the Geniza collection is Wuhsha Al-Dallala, an agent or businesswoman. S. D. Goitein wrote about her frequently; e.g., see his "A Jewish Business Woman of the Eleventh Century," in The Seventy-fifth Anniversary Volume of "The Jewish Quarterly Review" (Philadelphia, 1967), pp. 225-242. 31. See above, n. 10. Maimonides overlooked this contention in his second response. 32. Warren Zev Harvey, "The Obligation of Talmud on Women According to Maimonides," Tradition 19, no. 2 (Summer 1981): 128.</page><page sequence="15">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 33 marriage contract, but focuses on her teaching and how the husband can prevent her from continuing or seeking a divorce on this basis. While the husband's question centered on the issue of the second wife, Maimonides' reply reverted to the status of the first and only wife and how she could be legally coerced to return to live with her husband. In her petition, the wife asked whether she indeed had to abandon her job and return to a life of poverty, performing her wifely duties when her husband had never fulfilled any of his obligations as mandated by the Torah, and to give him permission to marry another woman. According to Jewish law, husbands (and not just wives) have obligations when a marriage is contracted,33 and if man does not fulfill them, he can be forced to grant his wife a divorce and make the appropriate payment. However, said Maimonides, the husband in this case may indeed prevent his wife from teaching a craft or reading. Thus, if the facts presented by the wife were true, she should obtain a divorce from her husband. As a divorcee, she would become an independent woman, free to teach if she so desired and basically do as she pleased. When Maimonides made his second decision, based on the fuller details provided by the wife, he clearly did not object to the fact that she was actually teaching. On the contrary, by suggesting that she seek a divorce, thereby changing her status from that of a married woman under the authority of her husband to that of a divorcee free from such authority, he offered an option by which she could continue teaching or do whatever she wanted. In Jewish and many other traditional societies, widows and divorcees can achieve a degree of independence unknown to most married women. Maimonides was not oblivious to this; in fact, that is precisely why he made a recommendation that would free her "if her words are words of truth." Once again, the rabbinic court was called in to take action. In the first round, it had been instructed to support the husband in preventing his wife from teaching; in the second, it could be told to force the husband to divorce his wife precisely because he had not fulfilled any of his obligations. One assumes that the situation of this couple was no secret to the Jewish 33. The husband has obligations to his wife while residing at home but also while out of town or abroad. There is a discussion in B.T., Ketubbot (13:1) 107a, about whether or not a wife can claim maintenance from a husband who went to a country beyond the sea. This reflects a concern for the women and children left behind, who were not necessarily properly cared for when the husbands went abroad.</page><page sequence="16">34 RENEE LEVINE MELAMMED community; at the very least, their neighbors were aware of it. Consequently, the wife's statement could be easily verified, if need be.34 After Maimonides explained that the court could be instructed to enforce the divorce proceedings, he added that the husband would be required to make the me 'uhar payment, ironically adding, "if he possesses it." This clarifies his reason for suggesting that the wife forgo the payment in order to obtain a divorce; undoubtedly both the wife and the decisor knew that the husband did not have it. Once Maimonides had assessed the case, the aim of his decision was to enable the woman to obtain a divorce from a husband who, as we have seen, primarily wanted permission to marry a second wife. The option Maimonides suggested, that the wife become a moredet, or rebellious woman, was a means of circumventing the legal technicalities of the situation. If the wife behaved unacceptably, the court could force the husband to divorce her; under the law a moredet forfeited the payment due her, but in this case, in any event, there was no chance of the wife obtaining it. Thus we see that Maimonides was seeking to provide a legal means for the woman to extricate herself from an impossible marital situation and emerge as an independent woman.35 When these two documents are joined together, they clearly represent a tremendous find. Not only did Maimonides ultimately not object to a woman serving as a teacher, but he helped to provide a way for her to be gainfully employed in the teaching profession. The misleading information in the husband's question colored his first decision; once a fuller picture was painted, the solution to the dilemma was changed just as significantly. Lastly, the fact that there was a woman teacher in twelfth-century Cairo is quite an unexpected discovery. Moreover, she was not a wealthy young woman who had been educated by private tutors, or the daughter of a rabbi who had taught her because he had no sons to whom he could impart his Torah learning. On the contrary, she rose from dire poverty and, on her own initiative, found an honorable profession. Building on what her husband apparently had taught her, she had gone on to acquire more advanced knowledge from her brother as well as on her own. The end result was a competent teacher with a strong 34. The comment by Maimonides here, "if her words are words of truth," makes it clear that verification is necessary, as it should be in a case in which two conflicting versions are presented. 35. See S. D. Goitein, "The Jewish Family of the High Middle Ages as Revealed by the Documents of the Cairo Geniza," Gli Ebrei Nell 'alto Medioevo 2 (1980): 713-733; he discusses divorce as a means to gain freedom and comments that "even in upper-class or scholarly families divorce was preferred to a bad marriage" (p. 732).</page><page sequence="17">A WOMAN TEACHER IN TWELFTH-CENTURY CAIRO 35 following; a solution was found which allowed her to support herself and her sons as well as to pay the rent for lodgings conveniently adjacent to the school. In addition, and while last, most definitely not least, this woman had the inner strength to bring her case to the rabbinic court. Her husband, who went to the court first, returned with a ruling authorizing him to prevent her from working in her profession; essentially he had a court injunction to support his position. Unwilling to accept this unjust ruling, she appealed to the court, presenting her case with a much fuller version of the story. Maimonides was consulted again, and this time he issued a decision in favor of the wife. This already independent married woman was now able to gain legal independence by means of a divorce from her good-for-nothing husband; as the great rabbi from Cairo said, then "she will be her own woman, [free to] teach whomever she pleases and do whatever she pleases." Ultimately, the main point here is not whether this woman was allowed to teach or not, but how a woman, having chosen a path that was fraught with difficulties, could maneuver within the limitations imposed upon her by Jewish law. In the long run, Maimonides enabled the woman in this case to maintain her identity, her source of income, and her independence. Other women no doubt faced similar obstacles and restrictions in other periods and cultures, for the need to maneuver within societal bounds is a reality of women's lives. Yet these two responsa uncover a specific and fascinating situation in which an intelligent and determined woman in twelfth-century Jewish Cairo was able to support herself and remain within the bounds of propriety; needless to say, one of the most eminent scholars in Jewish history adjudicated her case and made it possible for her to prevail.
