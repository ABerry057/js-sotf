<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susannah Heschel. Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus. Chicago Studies in the History of Judaism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997. xii, 315 pp. Susannah Heschel performs five important tasks in this excellent book. First, she demonstrates the unity of Abraham Geiger's scholarship and its integral relationship to his advocacy. From his early (1833) Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthum aufgenommen ("What Did Mohammed Acquire from Judaism?") through his Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel ("Original Text and Translations of the Bible") and his Das Judenthum und seine Geschichte ("Judaism and Its History") to his later, increasingly angry replies to scholarly Christian attacks, Geiger portrays both Islam and Christianity as derivatives of a vital, self-critical rabbinic Judaism in Second Temple times. This portrayal-Heschel calls it a "construction"--of the past meant that Judaism, not Christianity, was really the universalist religion of the West. This, in turn, meant that Reform Judaism was continuous with liberal, Second Temple Pharisaism, whereas rigid Jewish orthodoxy was actually a more recent response to Christian oppression. So, Reform Judaism was not a mere innovation, and really liberal Christians should become Reform Jews. Second, Heschel narrates and analyzes Geiger's success, and failure,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 407 in reaching and persuading liberal Protestant scholars in Germany. Geiger received frequent acknowledgments in their notes, but he did not affect their essentially ahistorical portrayal of Jesus' religiosity and of their anti- judaic understanding of the Pharisaism that, so Geiger believed, Jesus had practiced. They insultingly refused to open their scholarly journals to his writings. (Liberal Protestant responses are at issue because Catholic religious scholarship was not yet historical, and Protestant conservatives dismissed Geiger's work out of hand.) Heschel's third achievement is her description and contextualization of liberal Protestant christology in her seventh chapter, "Fixing the Theological Gaze." There she traces liberal Protestant treatment of Geiger's leading ideas and, in so doing, gives a clear and economical history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century German constructions of Second Temple Judaism and responses to the idea of a Jewish Jesus. Heschel acknowledges having done extensive work in the relevant holdings of the Union Theological Library in New York. She put her time there to very good use. Heschel's book would be valuable if she had done nothing more than these three things, for she has carried further the work of the scholars she acknowledges at the outset---notably Michael Meyer and the late Uriel Tal-in this indispensable, contextualized study of a central figure of the Wissenschaft des Judenthums movement. But Heschel does more. She usefully apples the late Adam Funkenstein's concept of 'counterhistory to analyze Geiger's work. Christian scholars, she argues, had already constructed a counterhistory of the Jewish past, and Geiger defended his people with a "counterhistory of Christian counterhistory." He could do this because he, not they, knew rabbinic sources. It follows that when Christian scholars ignored his findings, they moved beyond "involuntary ignorance" to a "deliberate effort to present a false record as the truth" (pp. 13-14). Geiger's scholarly case, therefore, was deliberately radical as a counter to Christian (and Islamic) supersessionism. This offered to "colonized" Jews a chance to reacquire a history. Heschel's showing, therefore, increases our understanding of the scholarly bases of German judeophobia. Fifth, and finally, Heschel's interpretive mode is contextualist intellectual history with frankly poststructuralist elements. For example, she usefully applies Foucault on authorship, and her language continually reminds us that Geiger and his adversaries had to "negotiate" and "construct." These unquestionably are the best terms to characterize the process she studies. There is more. Heschel begins her book with a discussion of the furor caused</page><page sequence="3">408 BOOK REVIEWS in 1856 by the display of Manet's Olympia, in which the nude "stared straight out at her viewer" in a manner that seemed "insolent and uncivilized" (p. 1). The metaphor seems apt, and Heschel returns to it in both her final chapter and her conclusion. Thus, Geiger fixed his gaze at Christian scholars, though he either did not catch their eyes or offended them. At the end of her book, we learn: "There is a metaphoric architecture to the female body that constructs both genders, and there is a metaphoric architecture to Judaism in Christian theological writings that constructs both religions; both the female and the Jewish become the sites for production of the uncanny" (p. 241). Geiger, of course, revealingly challenged and shocked Christian readers in just the same way that Manet's nude shocked visitors to the 1856 World Exhibition. The effect, as Heschel's final sentence argues, was that "the Jewish scholar, in narrating the Jesus story, becomes the hero, capturing the power of the story and attempting the same destabilization of Christianity that Christians have attempted of Judaism" (p. 242). Heschel's book is an important contribution to the history of Jewish studies and to the understanding of Christian scholars' sense of Judaism. It is also enjoyable to read. The book's two weaknesses are instances of underdevelopment of important ideas already present in it. First, I wanted to know more about what other Jewish scholars, apart from Heinrich Graetz, thought about Geiger's work and about Christian responses and nonresponses to it. Heschel gives some instances, but little sense of how like-minded Jewish scholars thought about his efforts. Perhaps this discussion would have made Heschel's work too lengthy. Second, in her closing, gendered discussion, Heschel adduces the concept of cross-dressing in literary theorists Eve Sedgewick and Marjorie Garber to situate Jesus liminally between Judaism and Christianity. The idea is both naughty and plausible. I only wish Heschel had introduced it earlier in her discussion and used it to study cases of responses to Geiger's ideas.
