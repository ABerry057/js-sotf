<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Elbaum. Openness and Insularity: Late Sixteenth Century Jewish Literature in Poland and Ashkenaz. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1990. 455 pp. (Hebrew). The title of Jacob Elbaum's work may be misleading. He does not mean openness to non-Jewish culture, but openness to cultural products from lands beyond East Central Europe, particularly Italy and the Land of Israel. He suggests that this "cross-fertilization," a product partly of the revolution brought about by the invention of printing, contributed to the enormous creativity characteristic of Ashkenazic Jewry in the period between 1550 and about 1620. Most of Elbaum's book is devoted to the elaboration of a taxonomy of the Hebrew literature produced by Ashkenazic scholars in the years between the middle of the sixteenth century and the end of the second decade of the seventeenth century. Describing the period as one of "spiritual renaissance," the author maintains that there is no greater error than the conventional assertion that the creativity of Ashkenazic scholars in this period was limited not merely to halakhah but to specific subjects within halakhah. He attempts to demonstrate that, with the single exception of belles lettres, every other branch of traditional Jewish literary activity was represented in significant ways among the creations of Ashkenazic scholars in the period 1550-1620. In the central part of the book, Elbaum assigns the close to four hundred works he examined (including thirty-six manuscripts) to one or</page><page sequence="2">128 BOOK REVIEWS more of six main categories: halakhah; exegesis; philosophy; kabbalah; eth- ics and homiletics; sciences, grammar, and poetry. However, he finds again and again that it is difficult to fit the literary products of the age into discrete categories. Individual works tend to con- tain elements of more than one genre. At times, what began as exegesis was transformed into homiletical discourse on ethical problems. Treatment of ethical issues was found mainly in exegetical and homiletical literature, and occasionally in discussions of halakhic problems. This blending of literary genres was characteristic even of the most systematic of the authors he dis- cusses, the MaHaRaL of Prague (p. 109). His philosophical works "are con- structed homiletically . . . , at times his words seem to be a string of com- mentaries on Talmudic dicta" (p. 154). As with the form, so with the content: the terms most often used to describe the literature discussed in this work are synonyms and near- synonyms for eclecticism, a tendency to harmonize, to mix, to meld, to synthesize. Elbaum suggests that the teachings of the scholars he discusses had three basic characteristics: their conceptual framework (ha-interes ha- mabshavti) was rabbinic, like that of the talmudic sages; their thinking was eclectic in its essence; and they aspired to the harmonization of systems and philosophies (p. 283). In the field of kabbalah, G. Scholem long ago impa- tiently identified this tendency "to blur the boundaries between spiritual sys- tems" (tishtush ha-gvulot be-ma'arakhot ha-ruab).' The author, however, makes no attempt to account for this striking finding, since his aim is descriptive. The third section of the book gathers comments from the authors of the period on the conceptions of divinity and of Torah, and the relationship be- tween kabbalah and halakhah. Particular attention is paid to the work of Moses Isserles, Ephraim of Leczyce, the MaHaRaL, and Eliezer Ashkenazi. Interested readers can now turn to this work for summaries of the themes of the works of the leading and lesser lights of Ashkenazic rabbinism in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. And they can follow the interpretation and reinterpretation of the works of Rashi, Maimonides, and other classical authors in East European literature of that period. Elbaum's i.
