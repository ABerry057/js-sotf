Given the nuanced nature of its arguments, no sooner did I think I captured his thought than I discovered that Fagenblat might also have made the opposite point. Nonetheless, a central line of argument does run through the book. My task will be to present it and also to challenge it. The best tribute to this fine work is to engage in vigorous debate about its claims. In reading Levinas's work, Fagenblat places himself between two critical approaches, both of which he seeks to oppose. The first approach denies that Levi- nas's philosophy is Jewish. Samuel Moyn, for example, argues that Levinas's thought was formed by the Protestant theology dominating European discourse in the interwar years. Levinas's claims about Jewish tradition are thus merely superimposed upon that substratum. The second critique does read Levinas's thought as Jewish, but this is precisely the problem for the critics in this camp. Accordingly, to them Levinas's works should no longer be considered philosophy but rather a veiled theological particularism, claiming an authority beyond reason and an exceptional status for Jews as a people. In his debate with both of these camps, Fagenblat reaffirms that Levinas is indeed a Jewish philosopher, provided that both Judaism and philosophy are understood in the right key. His first answer to those like Moyn who deny the Jewish element of Levinas's thought is to show that his major philosophical works, Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being , are interpretations of specific biblical and rabbinic texts. "Levinas's philosophical works are midrashi- cally determined from beginning to end" (preface, 23). More than that, his works "present a coherent philosophy of Judaism" (22). To note just one example among several of Fagenblat's, he claims that Levinas's early postwar writings (1947- 1961), culminating with Totality and Infinity , are philosophical elaborations of Genesis 1. Engaging not only with Levinas's works and biblical and rabbinic texts, but also with contemporary biblical and philosophical scholarship, he 1.

In Genesis 1, the world arises only when the tohu-va bohu is contained, and particu- lar beings come into existence as a result of God's act of speech. In Levinas's thought this is reproduced as the containment of il y a , achieved when human beings respond to the particularity of the Other. Just as the world, in Levinas's thought, is created not out of nothing, but out of the containment of anonymous, homogenized existence, so does it emerge in the biblical account. "My suggestion is that il y a is a phenomenological interpretation of Genesis 1 :2" (6). It follows from this that "the account of chaos preceding creation, for Levinas, as for Genesis 1, provides a moral rather than a naturalistic description of the origins of the world" (6). The world comes into being as resistance against evil, and cre- ation is maintained when the human being, in the image of God, responds to par- ticularity and protects it, always against the background of the collapse of the world into mere existence. "Creation takes place within existence; it is the emer- gence of a particular point of view that enables meaning to arise from the indeter- minacy of mere existence" (6, 21). Thus the task of the human being is to keep the world from sinking back into evil, through his ethical response. But Fagenblat's argument against Samuel Moyn does not end by establish- ing that Levinas was interpreting Jewish texts. After all, Moyn does not deny this. Moyn's objection, rather, is that in doing so he inserted ideas foreign to Jewish tradition. Against this, Fagenblat not only shows that there is a Jewish tradition of interpreting texts along the lines that Levinas himself does, but also, more cen- trally, he wants to point to the nature of the act of interpreting itself. Jewish texts are never ahistorically static but fluid, and their many potential meanings are uncovered by means of ongoing interpretive acts. That is what rabbinic midrash has always been. Further, biblical and rabbinic texts invite not just midrash but philosophical midrash, that is, elucidation of their meaning in a philosophical language, because to begin with, they have a virtual philosophical core. In every kind of midrash, the historical situation of the interpreter is not an obstacle but an occasion to discover new meaning. Interpreting is a complex movement between a fluid content and a fluid interpretative grid. The text is neither dogma, fixed forever, nor empty. "Philosophical midrash interprets Judaism in the best philosophical light and therefore depends on the philosophical milieu of the exegete" (8). If Levinas's interpretation of Jewish texts follows a Jewish tradition, it also nonetheless remains philosophy, claims Fagenblat. To establish this, he turns to Heidegger, one of whose major contributions to subsequent understandings of philosophy was that philosophical reflection is always historically situated and thus always operates within a certain horizon of thought. That horizon of thought is by definition textually dependent. With the help of the French philoso- pher Marlene Zarader, Fagenblat points out that Heidegger himself relied not only on Greek texts but also on Hebraic ones. Philosophy can no longer see itself as a timeless discussion of concepts, divorced from texts and history, operating with nothing external to the reasoning process. Thus the fact that Levinas built his phil- osophy on the basis of his interpretation of Jewish texts does not in the least inva- lidate his thought as philosophy. It works on two levels at once, as an interpretation 106</page><page sequence="3">On Michael Fagenblat's A Covenant of Creatures of Judaism and as a description of what appears in human relations. As such, it operates outside of any dogmatic authority. Levinas is not saying that his analyses should convince us because of the origin of his thought in some sort of revealed knowledge. He is claiming that his descriptions of our relationship to the Other are true because they cohere with our experience. We evaluate them using the normal tools with which we evaluate truth claims. Precisely because Levinas brackets any authority outside human reason, his interpretation is a secularization of the Jewish tradition. It is also what makes his work philosophy. Having demonstrated that Levinas 's interpretation of Jewish texts remains Jewish, despite its philosophical importations, Fagenblat next turns to the other side - those, like Alain Badiou and Judith Butler, who see in Levinas's Jewish side a contradiction to philosophy. One of their assertions, we recall, is that there is a hidden theological claim in Levinas's work. It advocates the bending of reason to a command - the responsibility to the other - that it neither estab- lishes nor can criticize. Is this not what dogma is? In response to this, Fagenblat returns to discussing the nature of interpretation. Levinas's philosophy is not dog- matic, because interpretation by its very nature constructs and deconstructs. "Midrash," he writes," is a process of continuously reconstructing and thus simul- taneously deconstructing the idea of its [tradition's] pure givenness and trans- mission" (23). Perhaps the critics' perception of Levinas's thought as dictating dogma stems from the fact that he did not sufficiently make clear the interpretative dimension of his thought, always claiming that he was merely resorting to human experience and reason, and not to Jewish texts. Thus his understanding of the command in the face of the Other appears as an absolute truth detached from context and subjective alteration, when, in fact, it is itself the product of a particu- lar, context-bound reading of a textual tradition. But, insists Fagenblat, "the Other is not absolutely, dogmatically revealed ... the Other is experienced exegetically" (23). There is no naked experience that hasn't already been formed by a textual tradition. "Ethics in no way refers to the Other directly, without passing through the text, as if there were some immediate access to the moral meaning presented in the face." Fagenblat's argument is that this makes Levinas antidogmatic, rather than dogmatic, since the responsibility to the Other, there before reason, is the result of the use of reason to explicate texts. The second charge made by these same critics is that Levinas, by drawing his philosophy from Jewish sources, privileges the Jewish tradition in a way not justifiable in terms of reason. Fagenblat denies that Levinas privileges the Jewish tradition. On the contrary, he says, Levinas opens up Jewish teachings to the whole world, making Jewish difference ethically insignificant. For if the truth of Judaism is the responsibility to the other, then every time someone enacts that responsibility, every ethnic, religious, national difference melts away, leaving only naked humanity. "It goes without saying that Jewishness for Levinas is a matter of ethical indifference - pure adiophora, as Paul rightly calls it" (31-32). Whoever enacts it is of Israel, which no longer refers to a specific people in Levinas's thought but takes on the universal meaning of whoever follows the teaching. On the basis of this reading of Levinas, Fagenblat compares him to St. Paul. Both translated Jewish teachings for the Gentiles: "Levinas's 107</page><page sequence="4">Annette Aronowicz philosophical work, like Paul's letters, is primarily addressed to the Gentiles" (28). Fagenblat addresses the concerns this might raise. For twenty centuries, Paul has been interpreted as dismissing the Law as a path to salvation, effectively erasing Judaism as a living religious tradition. To compare Levinas to Paul is to suggest that his work will lead to the same result, especially given that "not since Paul has such a radical interpretation of Judaism for the Gentiles met with any signifi- cant success" (28). Fagenblat denies that supercessionism is a fair reading of Paul, relying on recent reevaluations of the apostle's thought. Paul wished to preserve Jewish law for Jews while at the same time opening up the message of Judaism to Gentiles. Levinas is doing the same thing: "The same structure of preserving the Law for the Jews while applying its promise to the Gentiles can also be found in Levinas" (27). It is not a matter, he claims, of imposing a singular message from above but of addressing whoever has ears to hear, regardless of origin. This is why Fagenblat considers Levinas to be such a radical philosopher, quite different from other Jewish philosophers, who, he claims, used the language of philosophy to address not the world but the Jews. To further illustrate how far Levinas 's thought is from a Jewish particularism that would privilege a strictly Jewish truth, Fagenblat claims that his philosophy needs to be seen not merely as Jewish but as converging "with the plain reading of many of the ethical teachings of the New Testament": "Indeed, although he gen- erally avoids citing the New Testament explicitly, who could doubt the most pro- found proximity between 'ethics' and a certain 'Christian experience?' Do we not find in the New Testament everything Levinas says about the coming to pass of God through the ethical relation to the other?" (ch. 5, 8). Fagenblat resorts to the hyphenated term Judaeo-Christian to indicate this common origin. Making fluid the boundaries between traditions is, for him, necessary both for the world as a whole and for Jews in particular, making possible a stronger sense of the oneness of humankind. "Only a Judaism that goes beyond the identity politics of being Jewish is able to make a Judaic contribution to thinking about ethics and politics in our world today" (preface, 24). In evaluating Fagenblat's claims, I must first of all declare that his many beautiful interpretations, of Genesis, of Maimonides, and of rabbinic midrash do convincingly show the affinity of Levinas 's thought to these texts. But isn't the affinity he establishes more the result of his own reading of these texts through Levinas 's philosophy rather than from a direct influence of these texts on Levinas himself? The philosopher's exposure to Jewish texts was broad and diffuse. Can we really ascertain that he was attempting a reading of these very sources? In any case, perhaps it is more important to establish affinity than it is to claim that these particular texts were the origin of Levinas 's acts of interpret- ations. In Levinas 's own estimation, what makes thought Jewish is not only its content but also its insertion within the Oral Law, the long line of preceding com- mentators. Fagenblat inserts Levinas within Oral Law in two ways. In the first place, he shows him to be an important reference point for interpreting Jewish texts today. In the second place, he gives a pedigree to Levinas 's own interpret- ations by showing how some previous commentators follow an analogous line of thought. This is a valuable service. The act alone of using Levinas 's insights 108</page><page sequence="5">On Michael Fagenblat's A Covenant of Creatures as an interpretative tool in reading Jewish texts, while at the same time showing a possible line of rabbinic interpretation with which he resonates, makes him part of Jewish tradition. No other argument really works. But this is a mere qualification. My discomfort with the way Fagenblat asserts Levinas's indebtedness to Jewish texts goes much deeper. I think it is dangerous for the following reason. We recall that for Fagenblat, Levinas's claim about the responsibility to the other is always mediated through texts. That a textual tradition jars one into awareness of responsibility makes perfect sense and does echo what Levinas says. But I am not at all sure that this is the limit of Fagenblat's own point. He insists that no face-to-face relation can have moral meaning unless the parties involved have already been shaped by a set of teachings about this meaning: "The Saying is strictly speaking not an immediate experience of another person as a speaking subject but the idea of the singularity of the other is deduced from the interlocutory situation - a deduction that I wager takes place by way of Scripture and tradition " (35, my emphasis). In other words, in Fagenblat's reading, I respond not to the Face but to the idea of the face, given to me through my tradition. This is simply the opposite of what Levinas is saying. The responsibility evoked by the presence of the other person is there before any intercession of reason or culture. It is outside all cultures and all times. That is why, in fact, one can speak of transcendence and the trace of divinity. It cannot be reduced to a historical context. In a talmudic reading such as "Temptation of Temptation," even the revelation of the Torah merely makes one aware of a responsibility one already has. Accepting the Torah, before accepting a content, is accepting that something precedes this content. That is what the biblical expression of na ' aseh ve-nishma means - "we will do and we will hear." We do before we hear. "To hear a voice speaking to you is ipso facto to accept obligation toward the one speaking."2 Levinas translates this as the very structure of subjectivity: But here is where the logical integrity of subjectivity leads: the direct relation with the true, excluding the prior relation with its terms, its idea - that is, the reception of Revelation - can only be the relation with a person, with another. The Torah is given in the light of a face. The epiphany of the other person is ipso facto my responsibility toward him; seeing the other is already an obli- gation toward him. A direct optics - rwithout the mediation of any idea - can only be accomplished as ethics. Integral knowledge or Revelation [the receiving of the Torah] is ethical behavior.3 Fagenblat acknowledges that in making the relation to the other dependent on a textual tradition he is departing from what Levinas states, but he is convinced that this is how Levinas derived his insights, rather than through phenomenologi- cal descriptions alone, and that Levinas hid the textual sources of his thought 2.

Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings , 47. 109</page><page sequence="6">Annette Aronowicz because any reference to religious tradition would have disqualified his philos- ophy in the French academy of the time. "Denying the Jewish element of this thought was quite simply the price of admission into the arena of French philos- ophy" (preface, 12). We will come back to dispute this point. But for now, I think that Fagenblat is himself paying too high a price in trying to convince the contem- porary philosophical world that Levinas was not making an absolute claim and therefore was not dogmatic. Levinas is making an absolute claim. To those who object to this claim because it posits a truth that can neither be established nor dis- lodged by reason, one cannot deny this. It is precisely what he is doing. If those philosophers choose to see this as dogmatic, perhaps it can be argued that Levinas is within a tradition of philosophy in which reason discovers something beyond itself. Levinas traces this tradition back to Plato's good beyond being. But more powerfully, is not the reaction of this group of philosophers precisely a confirmation of the problem Levinas indicated at the heart of Western philos- ophy? Everything has to be established by reason and has to become knowledge. This is a metaphysical position, just as much as his own. The whole point of Levi- nas 's work was to redirect reason to an acknowledgment of a responsibility that precedes it. If these philosophers feel constrained by this, it just means, from a Levinassian point of view, that they remain Western philosophers. Similarly, I have a strong objection to the way Fagenblat understands Levi- nas's universalizing of the Jewish tradition. I agree that Levinas is translating a Jewish insight into a universal language, making it available to everyone. But it would be a mistake to compare his project to that of St. Paul, as read by Fagenblat. For Levinas, Jewish particularism is not just one particularism among many, com- patible with universalism but not privileged. It is privileged, even ethically privi- leged, since it has an ethical task in excess of other peoples'. In many of the Jewish writings, we find passages such as this, distinguishing Jewish particularism from other national differences: The nations into which the West is divided have as their specific features only what logically appertains to every individual who belongs to a species. ... On the other hand, the congenital universality of the Jewish spirit ...involves an inevitable moment of isolation and distancing. This peculiarity is not merely the fruit of exile and of the ghetto. ... It is a strange and uncomfortable privi- lege, a peculiar inequality which compels obligation toward others while not demanding such obligations in return. This is undoubtedly what the awareness of being chosen is. Nevertheless, in the eyes of the nations and in our own yes as assimilated individuals, this inequality happens to take on the appearances of an irremediable particularism, a petitioning nationalism.4 But who . . . can still imagine that a peculiarity beyond universality is con- ceivable? A thought and a peculiarity of which Judaism as event, history, and Passion, is the breach and the actual figure.5 4. Emmanuel Levinas, Beyond the Verse: Talmudic Readings and Lectures , trans.

Levinas, Beyond the Verse , 192. 110</page><page sequence="7">On Michael Fagenblat's A Covenant of Creatures Not only is Jewish particularity of a different sort from all other particulari- ties. It is also essential for the defense of the persecuted human being against the homogenizing impulse of the modern State and the reason it incarnates. It is necessary for the world: One would have every right to ask if this apparent limitation of universalism is not what protects from totalitarianism; if it does not arouse attention to the murmur of inner voices; if it does not open our eyes to the faces which illu- minate and permit the control of social anonymity, and to the vanquished of humanity's rational history where it is not just the proud who succumb.6 Even in the passage that Fagenblat quotes from "Judaism and Revolution," in which "the heirs of Abraham are of all nations" if they follow in the tradition of receiving and feeding others,7 and in which Israel is assimilated, as Fagenblat quotes, to a humanity who has received the law,8 Levinas adds that it is the suffer- ing of the particular people Israel that makes it more representative of suffering humanity than of the proletariat, a theme he repeats later.9 I am not in the least denying that for Levinas Israel means not only the Jewish people but also a certain kind of behavior that can be found outside the Jewish people itself - anytime, in fact, that the act of responsibility is carried out. But in order for this universal meaning to exist, he maintains that a concrete Jewish people, with its long history and traditions, of necessity also has to exist. Otherwise, the universal would have no place to start: In a history in which the history of the universal God is yet to be fulfilled, a beginning is required. An elite is necessary. It is not through pride that Israel felt itself to be the object of an election. ... If chosenness takes on a national appearance, it is because only through this form does civilization maintain itself, transmit itself and last. Abraham was not the first to recognize God. But he was the first to found a monotheistic family.10 All of these quotations are from the Jewish writings, and not from the phi- losophical writings, in which this privileging of the Jews does not appear. Is this because "to the Jews, Levinas will have come as a Jew, to those outside the law he would have come as one outside the law . . . "? (chap. 2, 8). Does this mean that to Jews he emphasizes a privileged position and to Christians he makes the Jews as Jews ethically indifferent? But since in the philosophical works he never mentions Jews at all, it would seem that it is only in the Jewish writings that we have access to what he thinks about them. Fagenblat quotes from Jewish writings, both to 6. Ibid., 192-93. 7. Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings , 99. 8. Ibid., 98. 9. Ibid., 98, 104. 10.

If only for accuracy's sake, then, he must convey the emphasis on a privileged particularism all over the Jewish writings. One might conclude, as a result, that Levinas 's originality as a philosopher lies not so much in addressing the Jewish message to Gentiles, as it does in arguing for the centrality of the particular to Gentiles for the very purpose of making room for the Jews as a people. In the same essay in which Levinas speaks of the difference between Jewish particularity and that of all others, he also states: "since our emancipation we have never formulated this beyond [Western univers- alism] in Western language."11 He ends by saying that "Jewish peculiarity awaits its philosophy."12 I would like to hazard the thought that if Levinas did not wish to be called a Jewish philosopher, it is because his defense of particularism in his philosophical works does not amount to a philosophy of Judaism. For that, peoplehood and the law are necessary. But that is what stands outside the general categories that phil- osophy inevitably works with. The concrete life of the Jewish people cannot be universalized; the most that philosophy can do is point to the breakup of homogen- eity in the confrontation with the particular. There is a gap between this and the defense of the Jewish people as such, and it is precisely this gap that exposes Jews to persecution. Whatever the merit of this explanation, I do not think that those critics who argue that Levinas is privileging the Jewish tradition can be dismissed. He does do so, always in tension with a universal dimension. If this is enough to dismiss his writings as theology, one may well want to ask whether someone like Alain Badiou, who objects to Jewish particularism, does not do so from a secularized Christian theological position. Finally, as to Fagenblat's claim that the source of Levinas 's thought is not merely Jewish but Judeo-Christian, that "ethics is the dispersal of the Judeo- Christian God in modern social life," this too seems very dubious to me. Of course, Levinas engaged with many Christian thinkers and Christian texts. He even occasionally uses the locution Judeo-Christian. But in reading the bulk of his essays, one is struck by the opposite movement in his thought - the effort to remove the hyphen and to claim Judaism's completely independent position vis-a-vis Christianity. "Our feeling for Christianity is wholehearted, but it remains one of friendship and fraternity. It cannot be paternal. We cannot recog- nize a child that is not ours."13 Levinas insists that the relation of friendship cannot be translated into the language of a common inheritance. "Judeo-Christian friendship: there is a phrase that embodies an absolutely proper use of this syn- thetic adjective. But on the level of doctrine, as regards the finality of the human, major divergences remain."14 11. Levinas, Beyond the Verse , 192. 12. Ibid., 193. 13. Levinas, Difficult Freedom, 109. . 14. Ibid., 279. 112</page><page sequence="9">On Michael Fagenblat's A Covenant of Creatures This in no way contradicts Levinas's finding in Matthew 25 a teaching com- parable to that of the Jewish tradition. In his talmudic reading "As Old as the World," he states: "Let us be on our guard against facile and rhetorical antitheses. We are justice, they are charity; we love God, they love the world. From authentic spiritualities, no spiritual adventures are withheld."15 This means neither that all traditions are the same nor that all traditions are different, but merely that one can find echoes of similar teachings, but with nuances of meaning that open up abysses between the messages.16 In the same interview in which he speaks about Matthew 25, Levinas also goes on to argue about the great difference in emphasis that the ethical teaching has received in Christianity than in the Jewish sources. From Levinas's own perspective, Judaism is not in a privileged relationship with any other tradition in matters of content: "Israel is not defined by opposition to Christianity, any more than it is defined as anti-Buddhism, anti-Islam, or anti- Brahmanism. Instead, it consists in promoting understanding between all men who are tied to morality."17 He goes on to say that because Jews have been neighbors of both Muslims and Christians, the first effort at reaching this understanding is with them. The basis of this understanding is in resorting to the language of philosophy, which they all share. That is to say, Judaism seeks to express its particular concerns in the categories that others also use, thus creating a means for conversing, which in no way combines the traditions. Fagenblat might argue that despite Levinas's own understanding of what he was doing, his philosophy is nonetheless Judeo-Christian. He does propose that "the partitioning of Judeo-Christianity is a partitioning that is today less stable than it has been since the congealment of Christian and Jewish identity in Late Antiquity" (conclusion, 33 n. 14), which might suggest that Levinas's own view still harks back to an older dispensation, which is increasingly disappearing. I must say the new consensus-in-the-making alarms me, and this not only for what it does for my reading of Levinas's philosophy. In today's political climate, is this not a way of making Jews and Judaism part of the West against the rest? I know this is far from Fagenblat's intention, but what else could it mean, if it refuses to hyphenate Judeo-Islam or even Judeo-Hinduism or Judeo-Lakota? Is reclaiming a hyphenated tradition really, as he claims, a way of demonstrating that the world is bigger than the walls groups build around their identity? Or is it simply a way of creating another set of walls? I don't think any tradition should be hyphenated with another, but if commonalities are to be found, why not indeed find the insistence on a separate peoplehood in Lakota religion or the centrality of law in Islam at least as compatible with Judaism as some Christian teachings? Does the new climate Fagenblat talks about, in which a common Judeo-Christian tradition is proclaimed, amount to more than the old supercessionism in a new disguise? Certainly Christian Zionism would lead us to conclude this. 15. Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings , 78. 16. Ibid., 78. 17. Levinas, Difficult Freedom, 109. 113</page><page sequence="10">Annette Aronowicz Finally, I think that arguing for the Judeo-Christian basis of Levinas's thought also reduces the Jewish tradition to the Christian notion of religion, a set of ideational propositions - which Fagenblat himself argues against in one of his chapters. It becomes a teaching divorced from mitzvoth and from people- hood, a kind of twenty-first-century version of the attempt to reconcile Jewish ideas with the ideas of the contemporary West. In conclusion, I cannot help noticing an irony in Fagenblat's approach. His bold claims end up taming Levinas's thought. The latter 's insistence that the responsibility to the Other precedes reason and thus cannot enter into a philosophi- cal discourse, Fagenblat makes dependent on a reasoned discourse, that is textual interpretation, and thus subordinates to philosophy. Levinas's claim that Jewish particularity will always remain outside any kind of synthesis, Fagenblat hyphen- ates with Christianity, which at the very least invites such a synthesis. Yet, having said all this, I am still as seduced by Fagenblat's textual interpretations of Jewish texts, through a Levinassian lens as before. As with any good work, one eats the fruit and throws away the peel.

The first is that Levinas's philosophical works , in which he addresses and enjoins people without regard for identity (without regard for peoplehood and law), were produced out of strong readings of the Judaic tradition. Samuel Moyn showed how deeply Levinas was nurtured by interwar Protestant philosophical theology,1 and I sought to show that it was also possible to read Levinas's philos- ophy through the rabbinic tradition. Whereas Moyn's outstanding work shrugged off Levinas's Judaism as an "invention," I regard Levinas as a midrashic philoso- pher whose account of ethics amounts to a non-Jewish Judaism - non-Jewish since it is addressed to anyone, yet Judaism since, in my view, it is midrashically determined from the ground up. Most of the book attempts to show how Levinas's philosophy works as a reading of core concepts from the Judaic tradition and thereby as a phenomenological midrash of biblical, rabbinic, and Maimonidean texts, all of which Levinas knew well. But my concern was not only to add another perspective to our understand- ing of Levinas's sources. My second conviction was that a profoundly hermeneu- tical view of Levinas was necessary to save it from the charge of dogmatism that has been leveled against it. The turn to midrash was therefore not only an attempt to account for the sources of Levinas's concepts; it was also an attempt to make philosophical sense of them by understanding their hermeneutical rather than dog- matic character. I was struck by the prospect that a major philosophical enterprise, which claimed to describe nothing less than the basic ethical conditions of the world we humans inhabit, was comprehensively shaped by a reading of Judaic texts and concepts, even if the two nonuniversalizables to which Aronowicz points, Jewish peoplehood and Jewish law, do not feature as such in these works. Even if there is no account of Jewish peoplehood or law in Levinas's I am grateful to Annette Aronowicz for her critique of my book, and especially for her valuable and characteristically lucid presentation of Levinas's views on Jewish peoplehood. That view is indeed at odds with the interpretation of Levinas I provide, but I belive my interpretation of Levinas's philo- sophical position is still to be preferred. This requires explanation. 1 . Samuel Moyn, Origins of the Other: Emmanuel Levinas Between Revelation and Ethics (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005). 115</page><page sequence="12">Michael Fagenblat philosophy, here we have something like a "Torah for all who come into the world," as the Mekhilta calls it. I am intrigued by the prospect of using Jewish sources for genuine philosophical inquiry. And if I am right in finding a thick mid- rashic weave on the underside of Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being , then these works are remarkable, verging on the unique, for the way they draw deeply from the Judaic heritage to articulate a broad philosophical view that anyone at all might adopt. To explain the secularity and nonexclusivity of Levinas's philosophical works - in other words, to explain the philosophical status of this non-Jewish Judaism - I turned to Christianity, a move Aronowicz finds "very dubious." Writing with an exclusive view to Levinas's Jewish writings, she provides an alternative, cogent, and compelling presentation of his commitment to the unique value of Jewish particularism and of his skepticism regarding anything like Judeo-Christianity. She is right in suggesting that "since in the philosophical works, he [Levinas] never mentions Jews at all, it would seem that it is only in the Jewish writings that we have access to what he thinks about them." But my study did not seek to determine what Levinas thinks about Jews, Jewish particularism, or Jewish-Christian relations. It was concerned with the philosophy of Judaism ani- mating Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being and with the implications of having discovered the value of Judaism for phenomenological inquiry. In light of these admittedly philosophical interests, the secular, nonexclusive interpretation of core concepts from the Judaic tradition (creation, covenant, sep- aration, goodness, holiness, the saying, singularity, substitution, and others) that Levinas deploys in his philosophical works legitimize and indeed demand the pro- blematic hybrid of Judeo-Christianity. There are three reasons for this. One is that the founding texts of Christianity are, like my view of Levinas's philosophical works, midrashim on earlier forms of Judaism in which the categories of people- hood and law no longer matter as they once did. Although not to the same perva- sive extent, the Quran and thereafter Islam also contains interpretations of many of the theological concepts I find in Levinas's philosophy. Why then not refer to Levinas's "Judeo-Islamic" philosophy? Because Islam's emphasis on the juridico-theological determination of the community is precisely the element of Judaism that Levinas excises in his philosophical works. By contrast, in the age of Christian secularism that we in the modern West inhabit, juridico-theological and ecclesiological preoccupations are greatly attenuated. The convergence between Levinas's philosophical ethics and Christian modernity is therefore based on the twofold supposition that regards Christianity as midrashically entwined with Judaism in a unique manner and, more importantly, as signaling Judaism's capacity for self-secularization, that is, for retaining the normative force of its theological heritage without resorting to ecclesiological authority. One could therefore say that it has taken Christianity (including the Christian Hebraic tradition) to secularize Judaism, or to see that Judaism already bears the promise of a secular ethics such as Levinas provides. Secondly, it is not just the form of Christian secularity that correlates with Levinas's secular Judaism, it is also the content. Even as I argue for the biblical, rabbinic, and Maimonidean sources as work in Levinas's philosophy, I accept Moyn's view that this 116</page><page sequence="13">Response philosophy is shaped by Protestant theological sources, as well as, of course, by ancient Greek and modern European philosophers. If this complex range of sources can be bundled at all, then it seems to me that Judeo-Christian is about as close as one could get to such a label, despite the dangerous fraught geopolitical connotations this term has acquired in the years subsequent to Levinas's creative philosophical synthesis. In contrast to my locating of Levinas's philosophy within a more or less dis- cernible nexus of traditions that can be called Judeo-Christian, Aronowicz regards Levinas as pointing to an "absolute" account of ethics that is "outside all cultures and all times." This is the crux of our disagreement concerning how best to read Levinas, and the third reason for my yielding to the problematic hybrid of Judeo- Christianity (to which I shall return below). Although Aronowicz accepts my argu- ment for a deep affinity between Levinas's secular philosophical works and a certain midrashic pedigree, she also wants to defend the view, promoted by Levinas and many of his commentators, that the ethical claims of Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being stand independently of the religious traditions to which their author belonged. She insists that it is not just Judaism at work in Levinas's phenomenology but something outside Judaism since, according to Levinas, ethics provides an unmediated access to the real sense of the Other. "Levinas is making an absolute claim," she says. This is precisely the view I am trying to challenge. Our disagreement on this point is marked by an irony. In order to assert the absolute character of ethics, which Levinas constantly describes in terms of revelation, Aronowicz denies that this revelation is Judaic. To argue that Levinas's account of ethics is generated out of Jewish texts and experiences is, according to Aronowicz, to reduce the revelation of the face of the Other to historical, cultural, and conventional norms. Whereas by arguing for the significant role of Judaism throughout Levinas's philosophy, I risk contex- tualizing and thus de-absolutizing his claim for the transcendence of the Other. Aronowicz thus denies the Judaism at work in Levinas's philosophy in order to bestow upon it the authority of an absolute revelation, whereas I affirm this Judaism in order to deny its "absolute" claims. The irony notwithstanding, it seems to me that to make sense of Levinas's work one must either accept the absol- ute revelation of the Other or else account for the mediated force of the ethical claim. If Aronowicz thinks that foregrounding the interpretative elements of Levi- nas 's work is reductive, I think that denying them in the name of an absolute ethical claim is dogmatic. I take the criticisms raised by philosophers such as Gillian Rose, Judith Butler, Dominique Janicaud, and Alain Badiou seriously. They have argued that Levinas is ultimately not a philosopher for whom the rigor of conceptual or phenomenological analysis is paramount but a religious dogmatist captivated by the authority of a revealed law that is merely posited. The objection of these critics consists of a protest against Levinas's apparent sub- ordination of rational and even phenomenological considerations to an ethical imperative that can neither be conceived by the mind nor received by phenomen- ological intuition. The putatively absolute nature of ethics, in their view, is merely a way of invoking an unphilosophical authority. Since Levinas proposes that the 117</page><page sequence="14">Michael Fagenblat imperative of ethics comes from "the Other" whose face is invisible and unmediated, there is no way to bring discursive or rational considerations to bear on "ethics." If "ethics" is imposed by an authority standing outside the scope of reason and even beyond the evidence of phenomenality - the absolute face of the Other - it is nothing but religious dogmatism masquerading as moral piety. In Butler's estimation, Levinas's account of ethics involves "a demand that is not open to interpretation" and is therefore no more or less "uncritical and unthinking than an acquiescence to an ungrounded authoritarian law."2 On the basis of a similar appraisal, Janicaud concluded that "such a dogmatism could only be religious."3 But what is one to do? After all, Levinas's recourse to the presence of the face is indeed an appeal to the absolute givenness of a revelation whose moral force manifests beyond every conceptual grasp one has of it. Be it in the mode of rational reflection, representation, or even volition, Levinas contends that con- sciousness never accedes to the face and yet is bound, indebted, or obliged to it. How, then, can the charge of uncritical, pious dogmatism be averted? Moreover, does not the appeal to a commandment beyond reason ironically wind up looking very much like an appeal to the numinous that Levinas so wants to avoid? How does a commandment outside of discourse, history, and reason reveal itself? This is the central question. How does revelation reveal itself? The appeal to the face gets us nowhere, because on Levinas's own view the imperative is not issued from the phenomenality of the face. The face is invisible. Levinas even denies, quite explicitly, that ethics is strictly phenomenological and even that there is an experience of ethics.4 I do not agree with the critics who charge Levinas with dogmatism, but I understand their concern. Aronowicz thinks I have given too much weight to such critics. But I think that without accepting the hermeneutical or midrashic dimension of Levinas's work the charge of dogmatism is indeed hard to avoid. How does one answer a critic, or a witness, who charges "that is not what the face says"? Aronowicz says that "The whole point of Levinas's work was to redirect reason to an acknowledgment of a responsibility that precedes it. If these philosophers feel con- strained by this, it just means, from a Levinassian point of view, that they remain 2. Judith Butler, "Ethical Ambivalence," The Turn to Ethics , ed.

As he remarkably puts it: "The ethical language we have resorted to does not arise out of a special moral experience, independent of the description hitherto elaborated. The ethical situation of responsibility is not comprehensible on the basis of ethics. ... The tropes of ethical language are found to be adequate for certain structures of the description: for the sense of the approach in its contrast with knowing, the face in contrast with a phenomenon."

Although one should be careful in reading Levinas backwards, my point is that Levinas was always, and especially from the late 1940s, finding the "tropes of ethical language" that describe "the sense of the approach in its contrast to knowing, the face in contrast with a phenomenon," in the immemorial heritage of the Judaic theological tradition. Ethics is not simply a phenomenology but a phenomenological hermeneutic of everyday life. 118</page><page sequence="15">Response Western philosophers." I agree with this, but I want to make a not-so-subtle insis- tence on a subtle point. When Levinas redirects reason to an acknowledgment of a responsibility that precedes reason, he is not redirecting reason to some absolute realm that only an unmediated ethical intuition can reach; he is redirecting reason toward a tradition of revelation , more precisely, toward a tradition of rev- elation reconstituted midrashically. He indeed subordinates philosophy to an ethical revelation, but this ethical revelation "is not in heaven," as it were; it is a discursive accomplishment, a form of midrashic reasoning that actively makes ethical sense out of revelation. What worries me about Aronowicz's view is that it suggests an analogy - let me stress that it is only an analogy - to a type of fun- damentalism according to which one can simply point to the literal meaning of revelation and affirm it against all those who want to constrain experience with epistemology. The rabbinic tradition is essentially antifundamentalist. One is reminded of the talmudic sage Rava, who complained that people stand up in honor of the Torah but do not stand up in honor of the sages, when in fact it is only the sages who determine the meaning of the Torah. Moreover, the fact that Levinas thinks through the Jewish tradition and that the tradition provides him with a justification for his view of ethics should not lead one to think that this reduces ethics to concepts. That is the part of my approach to Levinas that Arono- wicz calls "dangerous" and "simply the opposite of what Levinas is saying." But what I want to insist upon is that midrash is not epistemology, for it does not organize phenomena into fixed a priori concepts. As usual, Maimonides is helpful here. In Perek Helek he says that people misinterpret the Torah (i.e., rev- elation) for two reasons. Either they take it literally and think that it is irrational - I think that Butler and Badiou belong to this group - or else they take it literally by jettisoning reason; and I'm afraid that this might be Aronowicz's view. And Mai- monides' answer, of course, is that revelation only makes sense if one does not take it literally, which is more or less what I want to claim about Levinas 's recourse to revelation. Even if I am reading Levinas against himself, I think that it is only in light of the Torah that one can make sense of his account the Other. Aronowicz's recourse to Levinas 's most famous talmudic reading, "The Temptation of Tempta- tion (BT Shabbat 88a), to demonstrate that ethics arises "before any intercession of reason or culture" nicely, if ironically, illustrates my point: Levinas 's saying that ethics transcends all cultural and temporal conditions not only takes place through but is also shaped by a concrete, historical Judaic text. This performative contradiction of using Levinas 's interpretation of Judaic texts to claim that ethics appears "outside all cultures and all times" extends to his philosophical works as well, if one is attentive to their midrashic underside. When Levinas speaks of the absolute and the transcendent, I take him to be describing the sense of the absolute and the transcendent as it is indicated by the tradition inaugurated with the Hebrew Bible. Here is an example I did not mention in my book, although it is no doubt the most obvious of all. Where has anyone ever seen, or even heard of, a face that can in principle never be seen and yet speaks, and, moreover that speaks in the mode of commandment? Plainly, in the biblical panim. The notion of panim in the Hebrew Bible is marve- lously resonant and perhaps ambiguous. Panim of course means visage, but it is 119</page><page sequence="16">Michael Fagenblat ubiquitously applied to God, where it is often translated as "presence" precisely because in the minds of many translators, as well as many readers of the Bible, the panim of God has no facial features. In fact for the priestly author, to whom Levinas is especially close, the holiness of this presence of God is revealed only through command.5 1 therefore cannot see how anyone can claim that Levi- nas 's account of the invisible face is an unmediated phenomenological description. It is, on the contrary, an intuition of an ethical commandment expressed by the voices of the texts of Judaism, or of Judeo-Christianity, in the presence of the Other. The only access we have to a face that is simultaneously defaced of its eyes, ears, nose, and even what comes out of its mouth and at the same time issues an absolute commandment is in the panim of the Hebrew Bible.6 Moreover, I think Levinas 's extraordinary phenomenological intelligence allowed him to intuit insights that have only recently been perceived philologically. For example, the intellectualist assumptions of postmedieval biblical scholarship gen- erally insisted that the biblical God has no form and is therefore invisible. But modern scholarship has demonstrated that the God of the Jews is (or was) not invisible in the sense that he cannot be. Just so, the invisibility of the Other does not lie in the fact that she cannot be seen but in the claim that she ought not to be fixed by the gaze of a knowing, objectifying consciousness. This is what the prohibition on representation means in the Bible. And this is what it means for Levinas when he wages his battle against the reign of the Be-griff the comprehension that grasps the Other in a concept.7 The so-called "direct optics" of the visage is seen by Levinas himself with biblical lenses.8 5. As Israel Knohl explains, "[T]wo principles are at the heart [of the priestly school], holiness and commandment." Israel Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and The Holiness School (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995), 149. Knohl's important study of the Priestly Code of the Torah is particularly interesting for our purposes since it argues that the Holiness Code in the Pen- tateuch (Leviticus 1 7-27) is composed under the influence of the classical prophetic critique of the sublime but amoral theology of the Priestly Torah. The Holiness Code would attest to the earliest attempt to reunite the ethical and the sublime, which is essentially what Levinas is trying to do. That is why it is not principally Plato's "good beyond being" that provides Levinas with a model for ethical transcendence but also always an attention to the moral prophets and Leviticus 17-27. This is another example of why I think Moyn is wrong to propose that Levinas is more indebted to Rudolf Otto, for example, than to the Jewish tradition. Both the account of God as "wholly other" and its moral critique are intrinsic to the theology of the Torah. Moyn's impressive intellectual history is too historicist and not sufficiently hermeneutical. It fails to see that Levinas has not only secu- larized the Protestant theology of the interwar period but also the tradition of moral holiness that is intrinsic to Jewish thought and within which Levinas is also situated. 6. Compare TI, 177-80/TeI, 151-55. 7. Levinas no doubt also has other related senses of panim in mind, such as standing before (lipnim) and within ( bipnim ). 8. That is why I am not at all surprised that Levinas confessed to Derrida that "what really inter- ests me in the end is not ethics, not ethics alone, but the holy, the holiness of the holy," Jacques Derrida, Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas , trans. Pascale-Anne Brault, Michael Maas (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999), 4. Moshe Idel related another intriguing tale to me, which is that Levinas once told him that he regarded Rashi as the greatest philosopher. One could easily dismiss this as facile, throwaway, or 120</page><page sequence="17">Response My argument is that this midrashic approach to Totality and Infinity and to Otherwise than Being answers the problem of dogmatism. Because now we have an answer to the question "how do I know that the face commands?" The answer is, because this is how I respond to (or read) the tradition(s) that provide(s) the her- meneutical horizon for my experience of the Other. It is because I experience the Other within this Judaic or Judeo-Christian horizon that I see the sense of ethics to which Levinas is pointing. Instead of appealing to a direct optics, I make the appeal to midrash, and I emphasize that midrash is a living heritage in which the conflict of interpretation transpires. If this deflates the absolutist character of Levinas 's claims about ethics, it also situates them within an open discursive field that allows them to be justified and contested. For "ethics" is doomed if it amounts to the choice between a dogmatic intuition that reason cannot know (con- tested by Badiou et al. in the name of philosophy) and a reductive epistemology that subordinates the Other to a concept (which is how Aronowicz and other Levi- nassians regard philosophy). This is the old and in my view unsatisfying dichot- omy of Athens and Jerusalem. In its place I sought to explore the consistency between Levinas 's philosophical works and a certain interpretation of Judaism, albeit in a secular, nonexclusivist guise. A midrashic reading of Levinas's philo- sophical works resists the charge of dogmatism by reclaiming the discursive and responsive work that determines the so-called "absolute" sense of the revel- ation of the Other. This midrashic approach to Levinas's philosophy also enables me to address the question of the political from a different perspective. From the absolutist per- spective that Aronowicz adopts, the question of the political is hard to place, since politics is unthinkable in terms of I and Other relations. Levinassians are thus faced with the prospect of a tacit humanism implicitly supporting the "universal" scope of ethical life and yet deprived of the tools to carve out its political contours in any recognizable way. Or else, as the standard view has it, for Levinas politics becomes necessary, almost as a concession, on account of "the third." The absolute primacy of the ethical cannot be sustained and therefore one proceeds to rational- ize social life. So one constructs a politics on the basis of this fragile originary ethical relation. But Levinas does have a philosophical account of politics, even what might be called a political ontology or a political theology, and denying it in the name of an uncritically assumed or tenuously derived universal humanism will not suffice. My view turns it around. Since I find that what Levinas calls ethics is her- meneutical from the outset, it always already arises in the contexts of shared tra- ditions and living communities. The fact of the collective, of the "us," does not need to be derived; on the contrary, it is the condition for ethics, since ethics is an interpretation of our heritage - not something that happens to me alone in absolute relation to the Other but something to which I attest in the context of bizarre, or else one could take seriously the thought that Levinas contemplated the rabbinic tradition quite like Heidegger pondered the Greeks, though with greater fidelity. 121</page><page sequence="18">Michael Fagenblat my belonging to an unstable but concretely shared heritage. If we think of ethics midrashically, then what Levinas calls fraternity is not derived from ethics but is the precondition for it. Some sort of collectivity or republicanism - some sort of sharing of a heritage - is the precondition for ethics. And this means that what is required for ethics is not politique apres (as Levinas called for) but politique avant , so long as we understand politics here not as the ordinary machinations of political life but as the political memory carrying our shared ethical heritage. This is why Levinas has such a strong sympathy for republicanism, whether in its French or Zionist form, because he understands that ethics relies on the sharing and contesting of a living moral heritage and that some political republic is the condition for such a sharing and contesting. But if, qua philosopher, Levinas is more of a republican than a liberal or a cosmopolitan, this does not privilege the Jewish people as an ontological or ethical category. What is philosophically significant for Levinas is the Judaic heritage; the "Jewish" is of no ethical consequence. Think of the difference between the Judaic and the Jewish as analogous to the distinction between the ontological and the ontic in Being and Time: There are no ontic implications about Jewishness, although Judaism or Judeo-Christianity is the ontological horizon for our moral sense of life. Levinas privileges the Judaic, not the Jewish. I suppose it is a matter of loving the Torah more than the Jews, or more than "Jewish identity." Needless to say, I think it is tremendously important for subjects to appropriate Levinas's Judaic midrash, especially in the state of Israel. But this can happen in ways that are at odds with all reigning forms of Jewish identity and peoplehood or in ways that are entirely indifferent to them. Being Jewish is valuable for any number of personal, historical, and perhaps theological reasons, but a philosophy of Judaism, including Levinas's, is utterly indifferent to the identity of the self or the Other. Indeed from the perspective of Levinas's philosophy, neither the self nor the Other has any proper identity. The phenomenology of ethical life is conditioned by the secularized theological heritage we share - whoever we are. Our moral experience is shaped by the theological heritage of Judaism or Judeo-Christianity, whether we are Jews, Christians, atheists, Westerners, non- Westerners or whoever. Levinas's philosophical works function as an interpretative argument within the ownerless yet very concrete theological heritage that constitutes our ethical sense of the world. By midrashically appealing to see each other in light of this ownerless heritage, Levinas invites anyone to share in this sense of ethics or else to contest it by an alternative interpretation of our concrete moral situation. Like a rather recent view of Paul, Levinas's philosophical works midrashically reveal what the oracles of Israel mean for modes of solidarity and subjectivity that include Jewish particularism without ethically privileging it.9 Aronowicz 9. In no way do I suggest that Levinas denies the significance of the blessings and the promises and even the lessons borne by the Jewish people in their history. Aronowicz says that "it would be a mistake to compare his project to that of St. Paul" because "for Levinas, Jewish particularism is not just one particularism among many." But neither is it for Paul. Think of Romans 9:4-5: "They are Israe- lites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ. God 122</page><page sequence="19">Response shows how Levinas does privilege Jewish particularism - but only in his Jewish writings. My concern is to explore how Judaism works in his philosophical project, and here I maintain that Judaism is thoroughly at work, in a covert mid- rashic fashion, though not in a way that ethically privileges Jewish particularism. Let me put it from another angle. I confronted a problem in regarding Levinas as a hermeneutical thinker, because this is essentially a Heideggerian gesture. It is Heidegger who transformed ontology into hermeneutics. And one might hazard to say that the difference between what Heidegger called "ontology" and what Levinas called "ethics" consists only of their respective hermeneutics. This is because Levinas follows Heidegger in locating transcendental phenomen- ology in the hermeneutics of everyday life, even as he inflects this hermeneutic, via a certain philosophy of Judaism, toward the face of the Other. Since this is the view I bring to my reading of Levinas 's philosophy of Judaism, much like a certain hermeneutics of Christianity is "formally indicated" in Heidegger's phe- nomenology of everyday life, I kept on seeing my reading as repeating the major political problem of Being and Time. In section 74, which I regard as the beginning of Heidegger's philosophical opening to Nazism, the German philoso- pher virtually invokes an ontology of peoplehood and on that basis an authentic destiny of the Volk in order to make sense of Dasein's fundamentally cohistorical condition. Having argued that Dasein has no essential identity but derives its horizon of possibilities for Eigentlichkeit (authenticity) from its ontological horizon, Heidegger makes two crucial moves, or maybe one and half. First, he observes that authenticity necessarily involves a coattestation of the self. Since all we really are, for Heidegger, is this sociohistorical Dasein, authenticity necess- arily requires a cohistoricizing "in terms of the heritage which that resoluteness, as thrownness, takes over."10 Just as "Dasein's fateful destiny in and with its 'gener- ation' goes to make up the full authentic historizing of Dasein," the worry is that Levinas might also think that Israel's "ethical destiny," as he once called it,11 requires a fateful cohistoricizing of the Judaic heritage, perhaps even in the state of Israel, though Levinas did not ultimately think so. Unlike liberals, huma- nists, and cosmopolitans, Heidegger thinks that there is no appropriation of the self without cohistoricizing and heritage. I think Heidegger was right to point to this exigency and I also recognized that my reading of Levinas - according to which there is no ethics without the Judaic (or Judeo-Christian) heritage - leads to the same problem. The problem is this: How can one appropriate this ethics, this heri- tage of Judaism (of Judeo-Christianity), without cohistoricizing it? In a sense one can't. But Heidegger's other move, or the half move (because it does not follow from Being and Time), was to yield, personally if not philosophically, to the temp- tation to resolve the heritage upon a Volk. The way to avoid this temptation, I think, who is over all be blessed for ever. Amen." The passage continues with Paul's allegories of Israel and the children of Abraham, allegories that Levinas frequently repeats. 10.

The Judaic (and Judeo-Christian) heritage of ethics that shapes Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being cannot be appropriated by any par- ticular people in the present, including the Jewish people, just as Heidegger should have acknowledged the authentic destiny of his Volk Although I argue that Levi- nas's philosophical account of ethics arises from the Judaic moral heritage, I also argue that there is no ethical Volk that could coattest to this heritage of thinking. What Levinas himself thought about this is not strictly relevant, but I happen to think he deliberately obfuscates and allegorizes the notion of Israel for this very reason, which also makes him sound rather Pauline. Needless to say, I've got nothing against the idea of Israel or of the Jewish people, on the contrary. But if what Levinas calls ethics really amounts to a philosophy of Judaism, as I hope to have shown, then it is crucial that the heritage that it interprets not resolve itself upon any people as the authentic ethical fraternity bearing this heritage in its history, memory, traditions, laws, or body. Not only is it crucial that such a res- olution of the Judaic heritage never transpire in "a people," but it is also ontologi- cally impossible. Which is why, if there is a relation between being Jewish and Judaism in Levinas 's philosophical works, it is completely anarchical, a being Jewish that runs that famous risk of subjectivism that on the one hand must appro- priate its heritage with others and on the other hand can never resolve itself into "a people," neither through blood, memory, or "destiny" nor through land or language, nor through determinations imposed by rabbis, states, or even enemies. In Levinas's philosophy of Judaism, the only thing that counts is Israel according to the spirit of ethics. And in my view, this simultaneously jus- tifies the existence of political republics in which this moral heritage is preserved (e.g., France, Israel, the United States) and at the same time implies that there is no proper community that would identify the Other as only one of ours.
