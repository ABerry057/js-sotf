<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frank Manuel, The Broken Staff: Judaism Through Christian Eyes. Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992. ix, 363 pp. The Broken Staff begins with a brief sketch of the initial stages of the relationship between Christians and Jews and includes, in its final chapter, a hasty overview of the Catholic Church's current stance toward the Jewish religion. The bulk of the book is devoted, however, to a review of the new evaluations of Judaism articulated by -Christians and "anti-Christian Christians" between the late fifteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In his treatment of this three-hundred-year period Manuel focuses primarily on two broad categories of thinkers: the Christian Hebraists of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries and the representatives as well as the opponents of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 261 Manuel apparently regards his attempt "to illuminate the main current in Christendom's recovery of Judaism" as a pioneering venture. In dealing with this subject, he aims only "to stake out general lines of development." Figu- ratively describing the nature of his own work, he speaks of the "soundings" he has "made for an archaeological dig, accompanied by an aerial survey" (p. 12). Manuel is, of course, neither the first archaeologist nor the first aviator to scout this terrain, but he does not consider his predecessors to be worthy of much mention. All he has to say about Jewish historiography in general is that it has sometimes reduced "Christian views of Judaism to a few formulas" and pigeonholed "them with anachronistic abandon as either philosemitic or antisemitic" (p. 9). The only previous scholar for whom he seems to have any use is Chaim Wirszubski. Manuel's dismissive treatment of most of the existing research on Chris- tian views of Judaism in recent centuries invites a defensive reply, one which would uphold the honor of Jewish studies. And, indeed, it would not be difficult to show that much of what he himself has to say has already been said by others-and has sometimes been said better. There is little to be gained, however, from any detailed comparison of Manuel's work with that of his predecessors in this area. It would be much more useful simply to focus on his analysis of relatively recent developments in the revolution of Christian attitudes toward Judaism. Manuel strongly emphasizes the high quality of the scholarship produced by many of the early Christian Hebraists. While portraying them as men of great erudition and impressive accomplishments, he makes it amply evident that their close acquaintance with the Jewish religion did not always incline them to "Judeophilia." A variety of different motives drew them to the study of Judaism, and they produced correspondingly different accounts of it, which ultimately provided grist for very different kinds of mills. Buxtorf the Elder's snide presentation of Judaism as a "literalist, niggling" religion gave sustenance, according to Manuel, to the disdain in which the deists and philosophes held it. The Anglicans, on the other hand, "drew arguments from his son," who "initiated a new trend in the Protestant estimate of Judaism" as a rational, philosophical religion (p. 90). The Dutch Hebraist Surenhuis published a Latin translation of the Mishnah accompanied by a commentary defending "the reasonableness of most of its legal provisions" and demonstrating "how they fostered peace and tranquility in the civil society of the Hebrews" (p. 95). But his work was "ransacked" in the eighteenth</page><page sequence="3">262 BOOK REVIEWS century by Voltaire, "and turned on its head to ridicule rabbinic Judaism" (p. 97). On the other hand, John Spencer's summation of Jewish ritual law, which was "rationalist and Maimonidean in spirit," served as a source for Abbe Guenee, who sought to defend the Old Testament against the attacks of the philosophes. At the same time that he points to such filiations, Manuel indicates their limited significance. While showing that the deists and the philosophes culled some of their information from "respectable seventeenth-century Hebraists," he makes it clear that they derived their basic view of Judaism from other sources. Like others before him, Manuel notes the way in which these "anti-Christian Christians" were influenced by Greek and Roman anti-Jewish writings. He recognizes, in addition, the enormous, if largely subterranean, impact on Enlightenment evaluations of Judaism of Spinoza's Theological- Political Treatise, a book which he characterizes as "the fountainhead of modern heresy" (but which he does not summarize in any detail, presumably because its author was not a Christian). He confirms the generally accepted view that the deists and the philosophes attacked Judaism primarily in order to undermine the foundations of Christianity. In fact, his discussion of these attacks, which were directed mainly against the Old Testament, gives one reason to think that they would not have been substantially different had their authors lacked access to any of the works of the Christian Hebraists. It is only the eighteenth-century Christian defenders of Judaism who seem to have made use of important arguments first popularized by some of the Hebraists of earlier centuries. Unfortunately, as Manuel remarks, the writings of such men as Guende "enjoyed only a brief influence." The writings of the deists and the philosophes, on the other hand, "effected a revolution in Christian Europe's perception of Judaism" and nurtured new forms of Jew-hatred (p. 165). Following the French Revolution, "theological hostility to Judaism tended to merge with the new 'scientific' and political antisemitism" (p. 247). Painfully aware of the catastrophic consequences of the developments he has sketched, Manuel nevertheless looks forward, cautiously, to a better future. The guarded hope with which his book closes is, however, one for which his historical analysis does not quite prepare the reader. In his eyes, the development in recent years "in many Western countries" of the notion of a "Judeo-Christian tradition" may portend "the possibility of a future syncretism." The religion he here anticipates would be a faith devoid</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 263 of distinctively Jewish or Christian doctrines, rooted in "an ecumenical tradition that glorifies the Sermon on the Mount, the Psalms, the book of Job, and selected prophets who could be transformed into universal moralists preaching the ways of justice, righteousness, mercy, forgiveness" (p. 322). This is a dream worthy of Voltaire "in his lucid moments," Manuel ironically comments, in the final sentence of The Broken Staff It would have been more appropriate, however, and perhaps even more ironic, for him to have concluded his book, instead, with one last nod in Spinoza's direction.
