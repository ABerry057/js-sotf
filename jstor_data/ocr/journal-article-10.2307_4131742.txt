<plain_text><page sequence="1">Andrew S. Jacobs. Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004. 249 pp. Chapter 1 introduces Jacobs' methodology. He summarizes the main critical approaches to Jerusalem as a Christian Holy Land in the fourth to the sixth cen- turies, and outlines the purpose and usefulness of postcolonial criticism as applied to the Christian writings and geography. The book is laid out thematically and at times in sequence, reflecting the central premise of the book, that "the colonizer and colonized cannot remain fixed binary subjects in the perpetually shifting con- test of power and identity" (9). Part 1 deals with the Christian literature. Chapter 2 sets out how the Chris- tians developed a totalizing discourse to construct knowledge and power and to identify deviant others. Jacobs quotes from Eusebius of Caesarea, whose Chris- tianizing version of Jewish history integrated the Jews into the scope of Christian identity; Cyril of Jerusalem, whose complete Christian being in the Catecheses comes into being in direct opposition to the Jews; and Epiphanius of Salamis, whose Panarion identifies the Jews as the ultimate heresy. Thus "the new Chris- tian self is inextricably bound up in the certain knowledge of the Jewish other" (54-55). Chapter 3 discusses Jerome's hatred for the Jews and reliance on them for instruction, contrasting his use of his knowledge of Hebrew and contemporary Jewish sources to exert religious and cultural authority over the Jews with that of his predecessor Origen, who aimed to define more clearly the Jewish-Christian differences, thereby grounding Christianity's own legitimacy. Jerome's detractors Rufinus of Aquileia and Augustine of Hippo point out that this intimate knowl- edge permits not only domination but also allows the boundaries to be permeable: Knowing and becoming may be confused. Part 2 explores the appropriation of the land as a Biblical space. Chapter 4 discusses pilgrimage narratives, in which the holy land took on sacred and mater- ial importance. A veneer of Christianity overlays the land through the historiciza- tion of the native population in the narrative of the pilgrim from Burdigala, in which dead Old Testament (OT) figures haunt the land; through a process of tex- tualization in the narrative of Egeria, in which she imposes textual OT figures on the empty land; and through the aesthetization of the land in the narrative of Pia- cenza, in which Christians appropriate the place for their own pleasure in its Jew- ishness. Chapter 5 discusses the further appropriation of the land by the process of 369</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews monumentalization and piety. The imperial presence is imposed on the land through building projects and the piety and imperial pomp of the female members of the imperial household triumphs over Jerusalem asceticism. In the desert Chris- tian ascetics opened up and resettled empty yet significant spaces, and there was a conquest and appropriation of relics, which are traced back to "old" Jerusalem. The intense interest, however, gave space for the Jews to subvert and resist, as well as be seen as forever "the other" who will rise up when they can, even when up- risings are caused by others such as the Persians in the 614 sack of Jerusalem. In his conclusion, Jacobs summarizes the debate between rhetoric and real- ity. The literature was initially considered to give no more than a stereotypical picture of Judaism, contributing nothing meaningful about Jewish-Christian rela- tions. Jacobs argues convincingly that they in fact contributed to the creation of a new world, in which we see the interplay of power and resistance. This is an extremely well-researched, well-written book and is a significant contribution to the field. Marina Greatrex University of Ottawa Ottawa, Ontario</page></plain_text>
