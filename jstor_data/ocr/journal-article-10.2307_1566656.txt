<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meir Bar-Ilan. Some Jewish Women in Antiquity. Brown Judaic Studies 317. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1998. xii, 165 pp. During the past two decades, the study of women's history and of gender in Jewish culture has come into its own, not only in terms of the number of studies,</page><page sequence="2">102 BOOK REVIEWS but also in the diversity and sophistication of methodological approaches. This is particularly true for the biblical period and its literature, but also, more and more so, for the rabbinic period and its literature. It would seem, therefore, that the study of women in various historical periods has transcended the need to be apologetic for its existence. However, Meir Bar-Ilan's book seems to be located in the sometimes antagonistic divide between the academic cultures of the United States and Israel in respect to the question of gender and Jewish culture, particularly in antiquity. Bar- Ilan seems to address a particularly Israeli academic climate in which, as he sees it, there are voices that uphold a total denial and suppression of the subject of women. He prefaces his study by pointing out that "in a world where both male chauvinism and reactionary religion prevail, there is bound to be unwillingness to read of sorceresses or prostitutes in antiquity, unless for the sensationalism therein" (p. xiii). With this world in mind, Bar-Ilan proceeds to characterize as the purpose of his book the presentation of "the history of the underdog." Drawing on biblical, apocryphal, and rabbinic texts from a period covering well over a thousand years, Bar-Ilan intends to present a picture of women's social status (p. xii). He does so by focusing on types of women, such as heroines, keening women, sorceresses, and prostitutes, rather than on individual character studies. Thus, he hopes to eliminate "the question whether each woman was indeed a historical figure or merely a literary paradigm" (p. xii) and insists that his book presents a sociological study rather than a historical one. Following his choice of types of women, each chapter collects and discusses the textual sources carefully. Despite his recurring statement that statistically the number of actual heroines and others or of their appearances in the texts is rather low, the reader actually gets the impression that the ancient world was quite populated with such women. The most successful chapters are those that analyze the importance of keening women, particularly for literary production, and the place of women's prayer. Even though Bar-Ilan does not clearly define his concept of the "feminine" nature of a text, these two chapters are replete with important discussions of women's authorship of certain biblical and apocryphal texts. In the end, the book remains ambiguous as to its own methodological approach. In spite of Bar-Ilan's introductory claim to have eliminated the historical question, it is precisely this question that plagues his readings of the textual sources. He</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 103 wavers between realistic, or historicist, readings and readings that attribute didactic purpose and authorial bias to the texts, between presenting a sociological rather than a historical study (p. xii) and situating himself in the contemporary historiography of daily life (p. 157). Further, he does not really address questions of representation, which has been discussed in a number of recent studies on gender issues in biblical and talmudic literature, questions such as: For whom do the texts speak beyond the author(s)? Whose perspective do they represent? Who is the projected audience? Unless these questions are dealt with, we can no longer simply extrapolate from the texts, either to a historical or a social reality. For example, with respect to the texts on sorceresses, Bar-Ilan reaches the conclusion that in a society that denies women access to the sphere of social leadership, "it seems that the tendency among women to practice witchcraft served as a means of expressing the feminine desire for power. ... The subversive activity by sorceresses was the sole option open to them, since normative channels were blocked to women" (p. 128). Even though the author does acknowledge and discuss the "demonization of women" as a product of "male opinion" (p. 126), he does not explain by what criteria we can extrapolate from the text to the historical existence of "witches." Again, his suggestion that the reason for the absence of copies of the book of Esther from Qumran may be its incompatibility with "the predominant moral outlook of the Jewish people at that time" (p. 8) simply assumes that a "predominant" outlook existed, ignoring the specific circumstances of the Qumran community. Another methodological weakness of the book is that Bar-Ilan's "comparative" diachronic approach (as he calls it), which deals with "the same issues in different circumstances" (p. x), actually decontextualizes the issues at the same time. It would have been helpful if he had explained why he deems precisely the categories he selects-the heroine, keening woman, sorceress-to be important. For example, when he observes that in contrast with apocryphal literature there are almost no heroines in tannaitic literature (p. 23), he needs to explain the changing nature of the ideal of the hero in general, rather than assume it to be an ahistorical concept. What are the criteria that establish a "tannaitic hero," and why do they exclude women, versus apocryphal.heroes and heroines? Finally, Bar-Ilan fails to articulate a conclusion about the status of Jewish women in antiquity. He makes a tentative suggestion in his chapter on heroines as</page><page sequence="4">104 BOOK REVIEWS to the phenomenal proliferation of women characters and heroines in apocryphal literature, which to him suggests "the rise of the status of women in Jewish society" (p. 25). This contrasts, of course, with the observation that "the association of women with sorcery illuminates the dynamics of the oppression of the weak and the way in which the ruling class constantly strengthens its political position" (p. 127). Bar-Ilan contents himself with making these contradictory observations derived from individual issues. In this respect the book lacks a certain degree of cohesion. This prevents its author from inquiring into the historical conditions for diachronic changes in the attitude toward women as reflected in his sources. What we may learn from the book is that there is ultimately no such thing as a more or less homogeneous Jewish society of antiquity in which women as a general group attain a certain status. Rather, different groups-priestly and scribal groups, individual prophetic schools, rabbinic study houses-produce their own visions of Judaism with diverse concepts of the role of men and women. Bar-Ilan's book should, indeed, be considered an important contribution to the academic culture in Israel. It is a hopeful sign for a more bilateral relationship between Israeli and American scholarship of Jewish culture in antiquity.
