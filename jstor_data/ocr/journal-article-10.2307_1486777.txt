<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joshua Eli Plaut. Greek Jewry in the Twentieth Century, 1913-1983: Patterns of Jewish Survival in the Greek Provinces Before and After the Holocaust. Madison, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1996. 220 pp. At the time that the author embarked on his research into Jewish life in modem Greece in the late 1970s and early 1980s, his subject was an unusual one. It remains marginal to scholars of both Jewish and Greek subjects, though by no means as marginal as it was then. Today this book can be read in the company of a large number of recent publications, and in the light of ongoing research, on various aspects of Greek Jewry. The book itself is hard to categorize and harder to judge. It combines a mixture of modem history, ethnography, and sociology and contains a large amount of new and interesting information. Particularly valuable are the passages concerning the rehabilitation of Jewish life after the Second World War, and details of the role played by national and international agencies in this process. The author's work in the American Joint Distribution Committee's archives has allowed much new material to emerge, especially on the issue of property disputes and management. The struggle to resuscitate and maintain Jewish provincial life after the Holocaust forms the central theme of the book. I have to confess that it was not clear to me why the author chose to focus on provincial Greek Jewry, as there is little mystery about the basic cause of its decline. The ravages of the Holocaust, combined with migration either to Athens or out of the country</page><page sequence="2">412 BOOK REVIEWS altogether, provide the obvious explanation for why Jewish communities have died out in places like Verroia, Xanthi, and Didymotikon. This is another way of saying that the decline can be easily explained without appealing to Greek antisemitism or state hostility. The latter exist, to be sure, but probably were of little relevance in this case. In general, the author manifests a very shaky grasp of the Greek context. He exaggerates the importance of Jews in Greek life before 1940, and makes a worrying number of howlers: England did not cede control over the Ionian islands in 1858 (p. 23), and Greece did not annex Corfu in that year (p. 27); Metaxas was not appointed prime minister in August 1936 but several months earlier (p. 52), and so on. The situation of Jews in early twentieth-century Greece was more complex than the author suggests; it should not be made part of a story of post-Ottoman catastrophe which sees the emergence of the Greek nation-state and the 1917 fire in Salonika as part of a downward slide to catastrophe culminating in the Final Solution. One wonders whether the author was in a position to consult the records of parliamentary debates and other Greek-language sources, as there is almost no reference to Greek-language material in the book. Important English or French-language secondary works are also ignored, such as George Mavrogordatos's Stillborn Republic or Aron Rodrigue's various studies of the Alliance Israelite. Perhaps the book is best mined as a descriptive source, accompanied by some good photographs, rather than as a work of analysis. But in its focus on post-1945 developments within Greek Jewry it points the way, in welcome fashion, for further research. Mark Mazower University of Sussex Brighton, U.K.</page></plain_text>
