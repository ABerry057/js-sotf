<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Gluzman. The Politics of Canonicity: Lines of Resistance in Modernist Hebrew Poetry. Contraversions: Jews and Other Differences. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003. xiv, 250 pp. In his epilogue to The Politics of Canonicity, Michael Gluzman has aptly de- lineated the parameters of this book, by writing that it "originates from the Amer- ican debate on canon formation and cultural wars that predominated academic dis- course during my years at University of California, Berkeley" (p. 181). This statement firmly sets its author within a critical context that auspiciously brings a wider literary discourse, such as that sustained by Chana Kronfeld and Hannan Hever,' into the realm of modern Hebrew poetry. In particular, The Politics of Canonicity is identified by its publication in the series entitled Contraversions: Jews and Other Differences, which has a primary interest in the ongoing redefini- tion of Jewish identity and culture, specifically involving issues of gender, moder- nity, and politics.2 The Politics of Canonicity is effectively divided into two parts. In the first, comprising Chapters 1 and 2, Gluzman provides the intellectual and historical context for the interwoven formation of national identity and the literary canon in modern Hebrew literature. In particular, in Chapter 1 he relates the story of the 1896-1897 debate between Ahad Ha'am and Mikha Yosef Berdichevsky, 1.

In the second chapter, Gluzman discusses the way in which Hebrew modernism created a coun- terpoint to international modernism's glorification of exile. He discusses a full range of premodernist and modernist Hebrew poets-Shaul Tchernichovsky, Avigdor Hameiri, Avraham Shlonsky, Noach Stern, and Leah Goldberg-in order to underline their resistance to "the idea of exile as a literary privilege or as an in- herently Jewish vocation" (p. 37), a resistance which Gluzman determines as call- ing into question "the critical tendency to read modernist practices as essentially antinationalist" (p. 37). Chapters 4, 5, and 6 move from the more general discussion of Hebrew mod- ernism to a focus on the individual poets who, Gluzman asserts, were marginal- ized because of their respective undermining of this paradigm. The third chapter discusses the career of David Fogel (1891-1944), which Gluzman perceives as "marked by his refusal (or inability) to participate in any collective enterprise, be it national or literary" (p. 69). Gluzman employs David Lloyd's definition of mi- nor literature both to classify Fogel's poetry and to explain its marginal status in the modernist Hebrew canon. He also integrates sensitive readings of poems by Fogel with those by Avraham Shlonsky and Uri Zvi Greenberg (central figures of Hebrew modernism), as well as with poetic manifestos and public debates, to recreate the cultural context in which they wrote. Chapters 4 and 5 present innovative discussions of, respectively, Hebrew lit- erature's reception of its first women poets and of Avot Yeshurun's 1952 poem "Passover on Caves." In the fourth chapter, Gluzman focuses on Rahel Bluwstein (1890-1931), Esther Raab (1894-1981), and Anda Pinkerfeld-Amir (1902-1981) in an effort to recover their participation in Israeli cultural memory. He investigates the cultural history of Judaism and Zionism through the lens of theoreticians such as Irigaray and Foucault, to refocus the poetics and lines of influence in Hebrew modernism. Bluwstein's "interest in simplicity," Raab's "fascination with open forms," and Pinkerfeld-Amir's "rejection of excessive literariness," as well as their "shared effort to develop a language of the self" (p. 140) are justly given a central place in the reconstruction of the narrative of Hebrew modernism. Chapter 5 ex- amines a single poetic text by Avot Yeshurun (1903-1991), with both the imme- diate goal of reversing the poet's marginal status within the canon of Hebrew po- etry and the more general goal of understanding the process and proscriptions that determined this status. Gluzman locates Yeshurun's marginalization in his radical disclosure of all that Zionism had repressed and excluded (Jewish history and tra- dition, the Yiddish language, and the Arab presence in 'erez yisra'el). To support this claim, Gluzman does well to present a fascinating reading of "Passover on Caves" as a Bildung poem, underlining Yeshurun's "iconoclastic rereading of the Bible-a reading that promotes a radical political end" (p. 167). Interestingly, this volume has received a very ambivalent review in Seforim, the literary supplement to the Israeli newspaper, Ha-'arez. While admitting that Gluzman has done a fine job in discussing Hebrew women poets, the reviewer Ari Ofenganden takes umbrage at what he terms Gluzman's "insensitive application of 180</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Anglo-American political thought."3 Yet it is particularly in his intelligent utiliza- tion of such theory that Gluzman contributes to a rethinking of the canon of mod- ern Hebrew poetry, as he searches for a wider conceptual framework that can in- deed "show how the apparently divergent evaluations of poets as different as Rachel and Avot Yeshurun stem from the same ideological formation" (p. 182). What we have here is, sadly, an unwarranted tension between those who view He- brew literature as participating in an international experience of culture and lan- guage, and those who do not. In this context, Gluzman's book should certainly be widely and closely read both inside and outside of Israel. For it is a propitious con- tribution, anchoring as it does the concern and discourse about Hebrew literature within a wider context, demonstrating that its "Republic of Letters" must certain- ly partake of contemporary intellectual life if it is to remain vibrant.
