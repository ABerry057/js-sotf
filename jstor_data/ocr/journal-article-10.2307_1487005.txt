Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. xii, 242 pp. Frieda Aaron's Bearing the Unbearable is the first attempt to formulate a poetics of poetry written in the ghettos and concentration camps. It is, need- less to say, poetry in extremis, par excellence. This is a well-written, well- thought-out book, with scope, methodology, and concept clearly spelled out. Aaron draws on her experiences as a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto and concentration camps, vast historical expertise, and intimate familiarity with the societies and cultures in which the artists she discusses lived. She possesses the necessary linguistic capabilities to deal with original works written in at least five languages. But, above all, she demonstrates remarka- ble critical and analytical talents, worthy of a true literary scholar. This is particularly refreshing since previous critical studies of Holocaust poetry, like David Roskies's Against the Apocalypse: Responses to Catastrophe in Modern Jewish Literature (1984), are basically historical/theological, and only marginally literary criticism. One may object to Aaron's approach, her translations, the largely Szlengel and Sutzkever selections, and her conclu- sions, which are based chiefly on these two "ghetto poets." However, in reading the book, one feels confident that the author has examined the materials thoroughly, and that the choices are indeed the proper examples of the genre in question. As stated in the introduction, the author of Bearing the Unbearable sets out to provide an "in-depth analysis of representative poems that because of their artistic maturity and their special historical significance seem best to reflect the Jewish response to the mass destruction" (p. 13). The methodo- logy is a "textual explication, for a close reading seems to allow the poems to reveal their own historical compass, to speak their own truth, to com- municate their nature, meaning, and significance in their own terms" (p. 13).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 245 In developing her theoretical arguments, Aaron focuses on "poetry con- cerned with the morale of the people, with forms of moral resistance, and the crisis of faith ... and with political and resistance poetry" (p. 14). A typical chapter opens with brief remarks on the poems in question (time of composition, the place, the historical climate, etc.), moves to enface transla- tion of two or more typical works, followed by a thorough analysis, and ends with concluding statements. Using Szlengel's "Telephone" and Sutzkever's "First Night in the Ghetto" as illustrations, Aaron argues that in the early phases of the Holo- caust, ghetto poetry was essentially a vehicle for imaginary journeys into the immediate past, an expression of the belief that the relative security and hap- piness of the prewar years could be restored. These poems, the author con- tends, had a "cathartic and redemptive effect on poets and readers alike" (p. 26) as they transcended the wretched present. While the need to escape through art was strong, so was the need to bear witness, to testify, as the Nazis' diabolical objectives became increasingly clearer. Thus the birth of what she calls "document poems"; Szlengel's "Things" and Sutzkever's "A Cartload of Shoes" are offered as typical of such works. But, as is correctly pointed out, Sutzkever "sought an idiom within aesthetic structures, and while he fine-tuned his own lyric voice, finding in art a source of redemption ... Szlengel seemed to avoid the aesthetic ... which he apparently regarded as inappropriate for ghetto reality" (p. 39). The accompanying close textual analysis of the two poems clearly bears this out. Szlengel and Sutzkever also figure prominently in "Morale, Moral Resistance, and the Crisis of Faith." These poems, as the title of the chapter suggests, were primarily expressions of moral indignation, as well as rage against a God who is perceived to be indifferent, impotent, malevolent, even perverse. This, and recourse to biblical and historical tragedies, is expected of Jewish poets living through the near annihilation of their people. What is startling, and Aaron is correct in dwelling on this point, is the complete inversion of the traditional concept of God. As Szlengel's "It's High Time" and Sutzkever's "Chant of a Jewish Poet in 1943" show, God is no longer placed in the role of judge, but becomes the accused, the punished, for breaking His covenant with Israel. Can hope survive in a seemingly godless and immoral world? According to Aaron's reading, much ghetto and concentration camp poetry is "marked by a mythic and prophetic vision that proffers some hope of redemption. ... this hope resonates in his [Sutzkever's] self-exhortation to sing from the swamps" (p. 82). We are inclined to believe that no situation warrants a</page><page sequence="3">246 BOOK REVIEWS total negation of hope; however, Sutzkever's "Kol Nidre" and "Grave Child," two extraordinary epic poems surprisingly absent from Aaron's presentation, come as close to utter despair as possible. In "Poetics of Exhortation," where political poetry and poems calling for armed rebellion are discussed, despair is, naturally, replaced by a sense of optimism. The works treated in this chapter, we are told, differ from the traditional Jewish poetry of "accommodation and appeasement" because of their "ideological repudiation of acquiescence as a vehicle for survival" (p. 134). As gleaned from Sutzkever's "To the Anniversary of the Ghetto Theater," "the redeem- er is not the providential Messiah, but rather the collective will of the people to transcend, as in the past, the inferno" (p. 141). Resistance, even without the slightest chance of survival, should be preferred over capitulation or pas- sive submission, urges Szlengel's "Counterattack." Poets like Sutzkever, Abba Kovner, and Kaczerginski put "word into deed" when they joined the underground and, later, the partisans. Their "partisan poems," Aaron shows, sing about Jewish pride, the Maccabees, death with dignity, and revenge. She also reminds us that, contrary to what we were led to believe, Jews were not passive victims, but were in fact the first to fight the Nazi beast, even though they could only rely on themselves, as most of the world stood by and kept silent.
