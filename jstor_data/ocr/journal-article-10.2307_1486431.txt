Leo Strauss, Philosophy and Law: Essays Toward the Understanding of Mai- monides and His Predecessors. Translated by Fred Baumann. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987. The occasion of this essay is the recent publication of an English transla- tion of Leo Strauss's Philosophie und Gesetz. This is an important and beauti- ful book. It contains a groundbreaking study of the political philosophy of Maimonides and his Islamic predecessors, and it offers an argument on behalf of that philosophy which is also a profound critique of modern philosophy. Philosophie und Gesetz deserves to be widely recognized as fundamental to the study of Jewish thought, but it has long been out of print in German and had never been translated into English.' It was therefore cause for rejoicing 1.

The rejoicing cannot be unqualified, however; for the translation is so extensively flawed by material errors that it is an inadequate and even a misleading guide to the argument of the book. That argument is challenging in every sense of the word; but it is not baffling, as unwary readers of the translation might be led to suppose. My purpose in this essay is to encourage the study of Strauss's book while taking account of the obstacles presented by the translation. Accord- ingly, the essay has two parts. First, in a discussion of the argument of Philo- sophie und Gesetz, I hope to give a glimpse of the treasures that make this book worth studying; and then, in a discussion of the translation, I hope to prepare its prospective readers for some of the difficulties they will face. I. The Argument of Philosophie und Gesetz The Introduction Strauss's professed aim in Philosophie und Gesetz is to "awaken a preju- dice" in favor of the view that Maimonides' medieval rationalism is the true natural prototype of rationalism and, even more, to arouse a suspicion against the powerful opposing prejudice (p. 9*). The powerful opposing prejudice, as it turns out, is not so much that modern rationalism is the true natural prototype of rationalism as that there is no true natural prototype of rationalism. Strauss will take issue with the view that nature has been proved by modern thought to have been a delusion. His twofold aim is, then, in the first place to arouse a suspicion against the view that it is irra- tional to inquire after the true natural prototype of a thing, and only in the second place to awaken a prejudice to the effect that as for rationalism, not modern rationalism but Maimonides' rationalism is its true natural proto- type. Strauss begins from the present situation of Judaism. This situation, like also contains a full bibliography of Strauss's works. * Except where otherwise noted, page numbers refer to the German edition, and transitions are my own.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 265 all phenomena peculiar to the present, has been determined by the En- lightenment (p. 10). The Enlightenment has undermined the foundations of the Jewish tradition by appearing to have defeated orthodoxy once and for all (p. 11). Strauss, however, comparing the "so-called victory" of the Enlightenment over orthodoxy to a prematurely conceded battle (p. 21), and remarking that victories are in any case very dubious evidences of the just cause (p. 17), proceeds to reopen the quarrel between orthodoxy and Enlightenment, with a view to reaching a well-founded judgment (p. 18). Thus the core of the introduction (pp. 17-28) has the dramatic character of a trial. The rehearing of this old case is motivated by the urgent suspicion that the untenable situation of Judaism may have resulted from an error in the original disposition of the case. Certainly there was an error in the ori- ginal jurisdiction: world history, indeed just the history of the last two or three hundred years, was mistaken for a competent court (p. 17). For what, after all, is the Enlightenment's case against orthodoxy? As a party whose interest lies both in solving the Jewish problem and in getting to the bottom of things, Strauss considers the arguments on both sides. It goes without saying that the Enlightenment did not directly refute the irrefutable premise of orthodoxy that God is omnipotent and His will unfathomable, or any of the claims of orthodoxy-the creation, miracles, the revelation- that depend on that premise (p. 19). Nor does the Enlightenment have a case in its supposed indirect refutation of orthodoxy, its elaboration of a philo- sophic system to prove that the world and life are perfectly intelligible with- out the assumption of a mysterious God; for its attempt to show that man is theoretically and practically the master of the world and of life has run into obstacles (pp. 20-21). Nor can the new natural science legitimate the Enlightenment, since it always had latent in it the modern "idealism" which finally understands modern natural science as one historically conditioned form of world-construction among others, and by which, therefore, the natural world-view of the Bible is certified as equally eligible (pp. 22-23). Nor can the Enlightenment rest its case on the modern ideal of freedom as the autonomy of man and his culture. This ideal only temporarily seemed viable at a moment when, "after the decisive entry into the state of civiliza- tion, one had forgotten the state of nature." But the state of nature was not to be disposed of merely by being forgotten. The ideal of freedom as the autonomy of man and his culture was only an unstable, absent-minded derivative of the original, the primary ideal of civilization as the self- assertion of man against overpowering nature (pp. 24-25).</page><page sequence="4">266 BOOK REVIEWS Here then is the true basis of the Enlightenment's case against ortho- doxy: the ideal of civilization as the self-assertion of man against over- powering nature. Strauss characterizes this ideal as a species of Epicurean- ism, though, to be sure, profoundly transformed: the original Epicurean animus against the terror in the delusion of religion has become the En- lightenment animus against the delusion in the comfort of religion (p. 25). Epicureanism so transformed, Enlightenment Epicureanism, is marked by a new virtue, intellectual probity, borrowed, though, from the morality of the Biblical tradition against which it was asserting itself: "This atheism with a good conscience, or even with a bad conscience, differs from the conscience- less atheism at which the past shuddered precisely by its conscientiousness, by its morality." The new Epicurean, instead of being willing to "live in hid- ing" safely, "learned to fight and die for honor and truth," and finally to reject the belief in God "for reasons of conscience." The true meaning of the Enlightenment's primary ideal, its "last word and ultimate justification," is this atheism of intellectual probity (p. 28). Having discovered in this atheism the fundamental premise of the Enlightenment, we see that for the same reason for which it is "admittedly not demonstrable" (p. 26, n. I in fine), it is as irrefutable as the premise of orthodoxy. Since, then, there is in the modern world only the alternative "orthodoxy or atheism," and since unconditionally political Zionism is the only "solution of the Jewish problem" possible on the basis of atheism, the present situation is untenable for the Jew who can be neither orthodox nor an unconditionally political Zionist. We are therefore compelled to ask whether enlightenment must be modern enlightenment, i.e., whether enlightenment must be atheism (p. 28). And thus we are induced to apply for aid to the medieval enlightenment, that of Maimonides, where Strauss undertakes to recover the leading idea whose loss accounts for "many modern convictions and doubts": the idea of law (p. 29). That "the idea of law" was the crucial piece of missing evidence in the original misjudgment of Enlightenment v. Orthodoxy appears to come as a surprise in the last sentence of the introduction, but it has not been wholly without preparation. If the opening movement of Philosophie und Gesetz is suggestive of a case at law, its deepest theme is nature, its ruling image is the cave, and its method is history of philosophy. In two extremely condensed essays which appear as footnotes to the introduction (pp. 13-14, 26-27), Strauss announces the theme, introduces the image, and justifies the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 267 method. He expressly informs us, first of all, that the "assertion made in the text" about the Enlightenment's attack on the biblical tradition "extends also to the philosophic tradition," i.e., that the case of Enlightenment v. Orthodoxy is equally the case of Enlightenment v. Philosophy. The Enlightenment's intention in attacking the Biblical (or the philosophic) tra- dition was to rehabilitate the natural through the denial of the supernatural; but, against its own intention, it only succeeded in overthrowing (or forget- ting) the natural foundation it had sought to secure. The leading idea of the medieval enlightenment, the idea of law, was lost together with the idea of philosophy and for the same reason. Since both took their bearings from nature-philosophy as quest for knowledge of nature, and law as necessitat- ed by human nature-both disappeared with the oblivion of nature. In order to rediscover the idea of law, therefore, it will be necessary to rediscover nature first; and along this path, law must lead also to philosophy. The primary rediscovery of nature can be achieved only through "a radical cri- tique of the principles of the tradition," Greek and Biblical, which in turn can take place only through history of philosophy. Strauss expresses this in a remarkable image: "To that end and only to that end is the 'historicizing' of philosophy justified and necessary: only the history of philosophy makes possible the ascent from the second, 'unnatural' cave, into which we have fallen less because of the tradition itself than because of the tradition of polemics against the tradition, into that first, 'natural' cave which Plato's image depicts, to emerge from which into the light is the original meaning of philosophizing" (p. 14). In order to serve this end, though, the history of philosophy would have to be guided by a mindful distinction between the old love of truth and the new probity: "for if one makes atheism, which is admittedly not demonstra- ble, into a positive, dogmatic premise, then the probity that is expressed by it is certainly somewhat different from love of truth" (p. 27). With this we are in a position to understand that the title of Philosophie und Gesetz is as much as to say, philosophy and law are in the same boat, the apparently capsized boat of nature. In this light we begin to appreciate the primary aim of Philosophie und Gesetz, the awakening of a suspicion against the powerful prejudice that there is no true natural prototype of rationalism. Strauss's project in Philosophie und Gesetz is to excavate a tunnel from the imper- meably sealed second cave back to that first cave where the faint penetration of the light of nature could still motivate the beginning of philosophizing.</page><page sequence="6">268 BOOK REVIEWS Chapter 1 The Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns in the Philosophy of Judaism. Notes on Julius Guttmann, "The Philosophy of Judaism" If the drama of the introduction lies in its representation of a trial, that of chapter 1 lies in the spectacle of Strauss playing at cat-and-mouse with Julius Guttmann, the learned author of a history of Jewish philosophy. With many expressions of respectful bewilderment and many patient unravelings of the bewildering assertions, Strauss demonstrates from Guttmann's book the untenable position of the modern Jew. In exploding Guttmann's thesis he uncovers the conclusion that enlightenment need not be modern en- lightenment, that the alternative "Orthodoxy vs. Enlightenment" need not collapse into the alternative "Orthodoxy vs. Atheism." The heart of Guttmann's thesis, as Strauss shows, is that modern Jewish philosophy is superior to medieval Jewish philosophy in this point: whereas medieval Jewish philosophy was able to retain the belief in the revealed form of the Bible, as being in harmony with medieval (teleological) metaphysics, only modern Jewish philosophy is able to retain the content of Judaism, the "personalistic piety of the Bible," as being in harmony with modern (mechanistic) metaphysics (p. 33). Guttmann, then, holds that modern Jewish philosophy is superior to medieval as content is superior to form. But Strauss's analysis of Guttman's thesis eventually discloses that revelation, so far from being only the form of the religious ideas of the Bible, is itself one of the religious ideas of the Bible; indeed it is "the central religious idea of the Bible and the condition of the possibility of all the others" (p. 41). Hence Strauss is willing to entertain Guttmann's claim that the original achieve- ment of medieval philosophy was "philosophy of religion," in the sense that philosophy was driven to justify its recognition of the revelation as a pre- supposition of philosophizing, and thus "to make religion a problem for philosophy" (p. 43). But Strauss is brought up short by a "shockingly unintelligible thing" (p. 52) in Guttmann's account of medieval "philosophy of religion." According to Guttmann, what makes the medieval philosophers who believe in the revelation "rationalists" is that they hold that reason is capable, of itself, of knowing the whole of revelation. So for them the purpose of the revelation is purely "pedagogical": it presents to the multitude the same truths that the philosophers ascertain for themselves through reason (p. 50). The philo- sophers therefore are not dependent on the revelation for any theoretical or</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 269 practical truth; and since even the multitude's dependence on the revelation is in fact supplied only by the philosophers' interpretation of the revela- tion, no one, ultimately, is dependent on the revelation (p. 51). Strauss ex- plains his shock: "whoever 'believes' in the revelation in this manner actual- ly keeps, as Lessing puts it, only the names, and repudiates the things" (p. 52). "Keeping the things" here would require that philosophy need the revelation, and have therefore a passionate interest in the revelation. How could philosophy of religion be the original achievement of medieval philo- sophy if what it shows is that the revelation, however "real," is altogether superfluous (p. 52)? Strauss is reluctantly compelled by the shocking unintelligibility of Gutt- mann's argument to venture two suggestions. First, the claim that the medieval rationalists believe reason is capable of knowing the whole of reve- lation is "not in accord with the facts" (p. 56): at least the exemplary medieval rationalist Maimonides holds that the revelation contains more than reason of itself can know. In particular, reason cannot answer the crucial theoretical question whether the world is eternal or created; for this the philosopher is wholly dependent on the revelation (pp. 52-53). And second, in considering the problem presented to philosophy by the revela- tion, Guttmann was guided by the modern division of philosophy, where this problem falls under philosophy of religion, rather than by the ancient division, where it falls under politics (pp. 58-60). Thus he missed the leading idea of medieval philosophy, the idea of law (p. 61). For Guttmann did not notice that the ancient and modern divisions of philosophy are not mere formalities but are marked by distinctive contents. The content of philo- sophy of religion is that the moral ordinances are grounded in the subjective moral consciousness, while the actual particulars that make law law are groundless (p. 61). But the content of politics is that man is by nature a poli- tical animal who therefore (cf. p. 109) needs a law, and therefore a lawgiver (p. 59). And when the problem of the revelation is considered under the heading of politics, it emerges that the philosopher is dependent on the revelation not only for the crucial theoretical question but also and especial- ly for the crucial practical question. For according to the claim of politics, the philosopher as a human being needs to live under a law that makes the existence of a human community possible. Even more, as a philosopher he is concerned with living under a rational law, one that aims at the specific per- fection of the human soul. But neither as human being nor as philosopher is he qualified to give this law as law, i.e., with all the concrete particulars that</page><page sequence="8">270 BOOK REVIEWS make it law. Therefore the philosopher, like the multitude but even more so, is dependent on the revelation (pp. 59-60). Strauss is thus compelled to concede to Guttmann that the medievals are indeed "more primitive" than the moderns: they are guided "not by the derived idea of natural right, but by the primary, the ancient, idea of law: they are pupils of Plato, not of Christians" (p. 62). With this, Strauss has intimated the thesis to which chapters 2 and 3 will be devoted: that the medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophers are Platonists. For against Gutt- mann's claim that "philosophy of religion" is the original achievement of medieval philosophy, we are now in a position to see that the doctrine of medieval "philosophy of religion," or better to say medieval politics, is derived from Plato: the revelation is the law by which the prophet becomes "the founder of the Platonic state" (p. 62). Indeed the only-but decisive- innovation of the medievals is to replace the possibility of a future philosopher-king with the actuality of a past prophet (p. 63). Thus even their innovation detracts from their originality; for since in their view the perfect law is already given, they lack the urgency in seeking it that charac- terizes Plato's political philosophy: "their philosophy of law does not have the sharpness, originality, depth, and-ambiguity of Platonic politics" (p. 64). In order to consider the meaning of medieval Platonism, Strauss begins by identifying the "highest point of view shared by Plato and the medievals" as the idea of a divine law. In this light, medieval Platonism must be under- stood as beginning not from the Republic but from the Laws. For it is in the Laws that Plato, "in accordance with a kind of interpretation which antici- pates the philosophic interpretation of the revealed law among the medieval thinkers, transforms the 'divine laws' of Greek antiquity into truly divine laws." For the medieval thinkers, Plato's project could be the starting point of a philosophic understanding of the revelation only if Platonic philosophy had suffered from an aporia in principle, through which Plato had been able to point to, but only to point to, the revelation as its remedy (pp. 64-65). Thus Strauss concludes chapter 1 by being thrust "as if by chance" on "the necessary connection between politics and theology (metaphysics)" (p. 66). For Plato the need for a law to provide for human beings stems from the absence of divine provision, and accordingly the realization of the ideal state depends on chance. Maimonides' successor Gersonides maintains against Plato that the world ruled by divine providence is already the ideal state; as a consequence of his "radicalizing" of the idea of divine providence,</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 271 human provision for the stability of the human associations becomes entire- ly dispensable. Gersonides thereby approaches "that modern kind of poli- tics which believes, on the basis of a belief in providence that ignores the power of evil, that it can confine the operation of the state within the nar- rowest bounds" (p. 66). The Platonic politics of Maimonides stands between the extremes marked out by Plato and Gersonides: against Plato, Mai- monides holds that there is divine providence; but in such a way that, against Gersonides, the human need for law is necessarily fulfilled by a human prophet. The study of the medievals that begins, like Guttmann's, from medieval metaphysics misses the political problem, in which is con- cealed nothing less than the leading idea of medieval philosophy, the philo- sophic explanation of the law as the presupposition of philosophizing. But the study of the medievals that begin from Platonic politics "brings to light also the metaphysical problems, and that in such a way as to offer the only guarantee of understanding their proper, that is their human, meaning" (p. 67). Chapter 2 The Legal Foundation of Philosophy: The Commandment to Philosophize and the Freedom of Philosophizing Since the actuality of the revelation is the controlling pre-philosophic assumption of the medieval rationalists, it requires them to ask at the outset whether philosophy is forbidden, permitted, or commanded by the law. Only after the finding that it is permitted or commanded, in any case authorized, does the question arise whether philosophy is free without limit, or whether, on the contrary, the law imposes a limit on the freedom of philosophizing. Strauss considers the treatment of this question in Aver- roes, Maimonides, and Gersonides. He formulates the view of Averroes and Maimonides explicitly (pp. 75, 79), and implicitly that of Gersonides as well (pp. 86), in the saying, "the freedom of philosophy depends upon its bon- dage." With this saying Strauss raises the question: how does philosophy's bondage to the truth proclaimed by the law differ from "the bondage which is given with the very intention of philosophy itself, the bondage to known truth" (p. 74)? Averroes presents a thematic treatment of the freedom of philosophy in the Decisive Treatise, where he argues that philosophy, defined as the con- sideration of the existing things in relation to their Maker, is expressly</page><page sequence="10">272 BOOK REVIEWS enjoined by the law upon those suited for it. Philosophy and the law cannot be in conflict, since both are truth. Therefore if philosophy leads to any apparent difference from the law, the philosophers are enjoined by the law to interpret the law. The freedom of philosophizing, then, amounts to the freedom of interpreting the law. Strauss proceeds to Averroes' discussion of five alleged limits on interpretation, showing how each turns out on exami- nation not to limit the freedom of philosophizing (pp. 72-73). To this point, philosophy is free. But its freedom is thrown into doubt by Averroes' dis- tinction between two kinds of error in regard to the law. There is a kind of error that is excusable in those qualified to philosophize; but there is a second kind, "disavowal" of the principles of the law or "innovation" in the derived teachings, that is inexcusable simply (p. 74). Strauss here calls atten- tion to the distinction between philosophy's own characterization of devia- tion from the "principles of the law" which are accessible to reason as "error," and the law's characterization of such deviation as "disavowal (unbelief)." The latter means that the acknowledgment or denial of rational truths has the "character and consequences" of the acknowledgment or denial of dogma, and thus that the freedom of philosophy is limited by an extra-philosophic, pre-philosophic authority (p. 74). This is the closest Strauss comes in Philosophie und Gesetz to a thematic discussion of the law as penal law. For the law there are truths the "conse- quence" of whose disavowal is punishment, and preeminently, as indicated already in Averroes' definition of philosophy, the truth of God's existence, by which the law stands or falls. "Philosophy is not sovereign...,. the law has the first place." Strauss leaves it open in what sense the first place is first, but makes a suggestion. "It is not that one occupies from the outset a stand- point outside the law, from which one proceeds on the path of rational reflection to submission to the law"; rather, one occupies from the outset a standpoint within the cave: "the law has the first place" (p. 75). Indeed one occupies even at the end a standpoint depending on the cave. For as the philosophers are human beings who are by nature in need of living under a law, the condition of the possibility of philosophy is the existence of the poli- tical community, which in turn is made possible by the law: "philosophy is not sovereign." The human prophet's provision for the human need of (punitive) law amounts to a defense of humanity against the (punitive) law of nature. When the law punishes disavowal of the truths by which the law stands or falls, it anticipates, i.e., prevents, nature's punishment of such dis- avowal. By singling out the disavower for exemplary punishment, the law</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 273 deters the career of such erring opinions as, if widely held, would undo the authority of the law itself, and with it the necessary conditions of human life and therefore of thought. Thus "the freedom of philosophy depends upon its bondage" (p. 75). But what are the truths by which the law stands or falls? According to Maimonides, philosophy as authorized by the law is free "in its sphere," which is nature, but bound by the law in the supernatural sphere, which human intellect is insufficient to know (p. 78). In particular, while Averroes had held that the law's teaching on creation is open to interpretation, Maimonides holds that philosophy is bound by this teaching. "For Mai- monides it is known that Scripture teaches the creation of the world and- what is even more important for him-that Judaism forfeits its foundations if the assertion of creation is abandoned" (pp. 78-79). The preservation of the foundations of Judaism is more important for Maimonides than the fact that Scripture teaches the creation; it is in fact "the most important reason which causes Maimonides to assert the insufficiency of the human intellect and its dependence on revelation" (p. 79). Averroes' teaching that human intellect is sufficient to master the question of creation depends on his teach- ing that the question of creation is irrelevant to dogma; i.e., that it is not a principle on which the law stands or falls (p. 79). Thus, Maimonides' dis- agreement with Averroes on the question of the sufficiency of the human intellect is secondary to his full agreement with Averroes on the primacy of the law. By denying the sufficiency of the human intellect to answer the question of creation on which the law stands or falls, Maimonides reaches the same conclusion Averroes had reached by denying that the law stands or falls on this question. "The freedom of philosophy depends upon its bon- dage" (p. 79). For Gersonides, as one might have inferred from his "radicalized" idea of divine providence (p. 66), no need of human provision for the preserva- tion of the community could limit the freedom of philosophy. Strauss pre- sents Gersonides' position as harmonizing the teachings of Maimonides and Averroes on the question of the sufficiency of human intellect (p. 79). Ger- sonides holds that while human intellect is sufficient in principle to the mastery of any particular knowledge, including creation, its finitude makes it insufficient in practice to the mastery of all knowledge. Thus even he accepts a limitation on the freedom of philosophy that is actually "much more radical" than those accepted by Averroes and Maimonides. He holds that the law, "like the world, is a work of infinite wisdom and grace and thus</page><page sequence="12">274 BOOK REVIEWS is knowable to the finite intellect only to a small extent; the Torah itself is a world, in which man lives." The law-"like the world, as a 'world' "-is prior to philosophy: the law has the first place for Gersonides just as for Maimonides and Averroes (p. 86). "The freedom of philosophy depends upon its bondage." Chapter 3 The Philosophic Foundation of the Law: Maimonides' Doctrine of Prophecy and Its Sources Strauss seeks first to elucidate Maimonides' prophetology by showing that the position in aid of which the Guide was written is possible only if there is prophecy in a certain sense. Then he applies Maimonides' proph- etology to the development of a deeper understanding of Maimonides' posi- tion. That position is the "religious enlightenment of the Middle Ages" to which he has directed our interest as an alternative to modern enlighten- ment. Medieval and modern enlightenment share their concern with the freedom of human thought, the "freedom of philosophizing," but differ conspicuously in that medieval enlightenment is esoteric, while modern enlightenment is exoteric (pp. 88-89). The difference derives from the fact that medieval enlightenment asserts the primacy of the theoretical life, while the modern Enlightenment asserts the primacy of practical reason (p. 89). Maimonides' position, "medieval enlightenment," is constituted by the Greek ideal of the life of theory on the one hand and the binding character of the revealed law on the other. The link between the two elements is that the highest object of the revealed law is to summon man to the theoretical life. Under commandment of the revealed law, philosophy takes for its sub- ject matter all of being, including revelation as the law given by God through a prophet. Since the sphere of philosophy is nature (p. 78), proph- ecy is intelligible to philosophy insofar as it is natural. Therefore prophetol- ogy, the philosophic foundation of the law, is the explanation of prophecy from the nature of man (pp. 89-90). In the light of this preliminary account of Maimonides' position, Strauss proceeds to interpret Maimonides' prophetology, relying both on the Guide itself and on its sources in Farabi and Avicenna. His interpretation has the form of an inquiry into the inner coherence of the six apparently uncon- nected faculties that Maimonides enumerates as requisite to prophecy: per- fect intellect, perfect imagination, perfect morals, courage, divination, and</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS 275 leadership. The inquiry leads through an instructive study of the Falasifa's psychology, and particularly the status of the imaginative faculty, to the conclusion that prophecy is both a combination of theoretical and practical perfection and an enhancement of each of these perfections over the stan- dard attainable by nonprophets. The prophet is both philosopher and statesman, "teacher and leader in one" (p. 108), but in such a way that both his philosophizing and his statesmanship are superior to those of men who are only philosophers or only statesmen. Having laid a groundwork in the elements of Maimonides' prophetol- ogy, Strauss proceeds to its entire system with the question, "What is the final end of prophecy?" (pp. 108-109). The end of prophecy is the end of Platonic politics: the prophet is the founder of a community which is di- rected to the proper perfection of man; he is "the founder of the Platonic state" (p. 113; cf. p. 109). The prophet, however, rather than ruling as king, is the proclaimer of a divine law. Since Maimonides presents his prophetol- ogy as the fulfillment of Platonic politics, our understanding of it depends on the relationship between the prophet and the philosopher-king (p. 117). According to Maimonides, law has two kinds: human, which is directed only to the preservation of the bodies, and divine, which is directed also and especially to the specific perfection and thus the happiness of man (p. 109). According to Avicenna, politics has two divisions, kingship and prophecy, of which kingship is the subject of Plato's and Aristotle's books "on the state," and prophecy the subject of their books "on the laws" (p. 111). Strauss shows that Avicenna's distinction between kingship and prophecy corresponds precisely to Maimonides' distinction between human law and divine law (pp. 112-113). He thereby suggests that according to the Falasifa the relationship between the philosopher-king of Plato and the prophet of the Falasifa is already intimated by Plato himself in the relationship between the Republic and the Laws. But in this view the politics of the Laws is not a descent from but the consummation or perfection of the politics of the Republic. Maimonides and the Falasifa follow Plato not only in their understand- ing of politics but also in their understanding of philosophizing (pp. 115-116), which they express by appropriating Plato's simile of the cave. Yet in appropriating Plato's cave-simile they also express a criticism of Plato's philosopher-king: according to them, Plato is mistaken in holding that the philosopher is the highest human type. It is the prophets, not the philosophers, who "see as it were the light itself" (p. 116). The philosophers'</page><page sequence="14">276 BOOK REVIEWS knowledge is necessarily indirect and incomplete; they are thereby depen- dent upon the prophets, for whom the night in which the human race is stumbling about is illuminated by lightning-flashes from on high, by direct knowledge of the upper world. Maimonides and the Falasifa derive Platonic politics from the un-Platonic premise of the revelation (p. 117), according to which divine providence makes wisdom directly accessible to human beings through prophecy. Strauss concludes the chapter and the book with the suggestion that this un-Platonic premise is after all not so un-Platonic (p. 119): precisely in this premise of the revelation, Maimonides and the Falasifa still remain Platon- ists. He unfolds his suggestion from Hermann Cohen's "paradoxical" claim that "Maimonides was in deeper harmony with Plato than with Aristotle" (p. 119). If the opposition between Plato and Aristotle amounted to that between the primacy of quest for the right life, for the good, and the primacy of pure theory, then Maimonides, with his "enthusiasm for pure theory, for scientific knowledge for its own sake," would have to be classed "uncondi- tionally" as an Aristotelian (p. 120). But, for the reason indicated by Cohen's own saying, "All honor to the God of Aristotle, but he is not the God of Israel," a Jew as Jew cannot be an Aristotelian in the sense at issue. He must, if he asserts the primacy of theory, limit this primacy in some way and thus call it into question. For Maimonides, who does assert the primacy of theory, the necessary limitation lies in the inferiority of the philosopher to the prophet: the philosopher needs the prophet both for his direct theoreti- cal knowledge and for his proclamation of the law. In this reservation against the primacy of theory, which appears in his prophetology, Mai- monides is then a Platonist. But what of the rest of his philosophy, where he appears to follow Aristotle rather than Plato? Plato teaches no less decisively than Aristotle that man's specific perfec- tion lies in pure contemplation. The distinction between Plato and Aristotle lies in the stand they take towards theory as man's highest perfection: while Aristotle "leaves it in its natural freedom," Plato "does not permit the philo- sophers 'what is now permitted them'"; he "'compels' them to care for the others" (p. 121). The distinctiveness of Plato lies in his calling for, inquiring into, a law, the "divine law," under which philosophy could stand as autho- rized and set free by law. Plato's aporetic quest for the divine law that could authorize philosophy's freedom gives his political philosophy its "sharp- ness, originality, depth, and-ambiguity" (p. 64). The political philosophy of Maimonides and the Falasifa loses Plato's sharpness, originality, and</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS 277 depth by resolving its ambiguity. Because the divinely revealed law that Plato could only desire is actual for them, they are therefore, as authorized by that law, "free to aristotelize." "Since, for Maimonides and the Falasifa, the law is given, it is not the leading and first theme of their philosophizing. Hence the metaphysical themes occupy so much more space in their writings than the moral-political. But indeed they had to attempt, as philosophers, to understand the given law; this understanding was made possible for them by Plato, and only by Plato" (p. 122). Strauss's professed aim in Philosophie und Gesetz, we recall, was to awaken a prejudice in favor of the view that Maimonides' rationalism is the true natural prototype of rationalism, and, even more, to arouse a suspicion against the powerful opposing prejudice (p. 9). Along the path of arousing this suspicion Strauss has brought forward for scrutiny the "paradoxical incongruity between life and thought" implied by Guttmann's argument for the superiority of modern over medieval philosophy (p. 35). That a para- doxical view may be true can be inferred from the conclusion of Philosophie und Gesetz, where Strauss defends Cohen's "paradoxical" claim about Maimonides' Platonism (p. 119). That a paradoxical incongruity between life and thought is not an insight of modern as opposed to medieval rational- ism emerges directly from Strauss's presentation of Maimonides' ration- alism. For according to Maimonides the revelation presents rational and suprarational teachings which, while not strictly true, are necessary for life, while philosophy presents rational teachings which, while true, are not strictly necessary for life (pp. 55-56 with p. 55 n. 2). Strauss's criticism of modern rationalism is not that it asserts such an incongruity between life and thought as would be shown by medieval rationalism to be illusory, but that it cannot account for this incongruity so adequately, so naturally, as medieval rationalism does. This is because the leading idea of medieval rationalism, the idea of law, entails the idea of nature. Only by recovering a standpoint within "that first, natural cave which Plato's image depicts" could we hope to emerge into the light, in accordance with "the original meaning of philosophizing." II. The Translation The task presented to a translator by Strauss's powerful, complex writ- ing is formidable indeed. A sentence like the following, where he describes</page><page sequence="16">278 BOOK REVIEWS the character of modern as opposed to ancient atheism, demands some thought. Dieser Atheismus, der Erbe und Richter des Offenbarungsglaubens, des jahr- hunderte-, ja jahrtausendealten Streites zwischen Glauben und Unglauben, der kurzlebigen endlich aber darum nicht auch zugleich folgenarmen roman- tischen Sehnsucht nach dem verlorengegangenen Glauben, der Orthodoxie in vielfailtiger Verschlagenheit, gebildet aus Dankbarkeit, Auflehnung, Sehnsucht und Gleichgiiltigkeit, und in einfiltiger Redlichkeit gegeniiberstehend, ist seinem Anspruch nach zu einem urspriinglichen Verstindis der menschlischen Wurzeln des Gottesglaubens befaihigt wie keine frfihere, keine weniger viel- failtig-einfailtige Philosophie. (Philosophie und Gesetz, p. 28) Nor is it just because of one's rusty German that the sentence demands thought; even in English it is difficult. This atheism, the heir and the judge of the belief in revelation, of the secular struggle between belief and unbelief, and finally of the short-lived but by no means therefore inconsequential romantic longing for the lost belief, confront- ing orthodoxy in complex sophistication formed out of gratitude, rebellion, longing, and indifference, and in simple probity, is according to its claim as capable of an original understanding of the human roots of the belief in God as no earlier, no less complex-simple philosophy ever was. This English version is Strauss's own, readily accessible in his preface to the English translation of Spinoza's Critique of Religion.2 Baumann offers, in place of Strauss's version, the following: This atheism is the inheritor and judge of the belief in revelation, of the cen- turies-old, even millennial, conflict between belief and unbelief, of the ulti- mately short-lived but not therefore inconsequential romantic longing for lost belief, of Orthodoxy in its complex cunning. Fashioned out of gratitude, rebel- lion, longing, and indifference, it stands in simple probity. It claims to be 2.

Like Strauss's version, Baumann's is difficult; but there the likeness ends. No matter how carefully the reader attempts to parse the translation, it will not yield Strauss's meaning. The more deeply he reflects on what might be meant by "Orthodoxy in its complex cunning," the further he will drift from Strauss's argument; for Strauss says that this complex cunning, or rather complex sophistication, belongs to modern atheism as it confronts ortho- doxy, not to orthodoxy as modern atheism inherits it. The reader of the translation will puzzle to no purpose over the paradoxical assertion that modern atheism is a compound of four interested motives that "stands in simple probity"; for there is no such paradox in Strauss's sentence. The complex thing that is "fashioned out of gratitude, rebellion, longing, and indifference" is not modern atheism but the complex sophistication of modern atheism; modern atheism confronts orthodoxy both "in complex sophistication" and "in simple probity"-an inner contradiction ("com- plex/simple") which may raise some question about its claim to have access to the true understanding of the human roots of the belief in God. Through a series of plain syntactical and lexical errors-mistaking the construction of der Orthodoxie and the referent of gebildet, misreading gegenuiberstehend as stehend-the translation constructs a chimerical contrast between the "simple probity" of atheism and the "complex cunning" of orthodoxy that makes nonsense of Strauss's actual argument. The importance that Strauss himself attached to certain key passages of Philosophie und Gesetz is indicated by his having published his own English versions of a number of them. It is thus especially unfortunate that Baumann's translation, both here and in other such passages,3 has replaced Strauss's own lucid English version with a version that both misrepresents the original and is unintelligible in itself. In passages of Philosophie und Gesetz of which there are no published English versions by Strauss himself, the mistranslations, though no less regrettable, are perhaps more understandable. It is after all a difficult book. 3.

This simple rule would have led Baumann to reconsider scores of passages in the translation. For example, in a passage where Strauss is discussing Guttmann's account of the relative merits of medieval and modern philosophy from the point of view of Judaism, Strauss mentions Guttmann's reference to the "break with revealed religion" brought about by the "mechanistic transformation" of metaphysics in modernity. In Baumann's version he goes on to say: But this loss is offset precisely because out of the Bible's spirit of "personalistic piety," the "inclination to a mechanistic concept of nature" and the revulsion against the assumption of purposeful forces, can, and in modernity actually does, come out as a "kind of polytheism." (p. 25) Since the sentence is a little complicated, one cannot know whether it makes sense until one has made a complete attempt to understand it. It says that something "comes out as" a kind of polytheism. The something is a com- pound something, "the 'inclination to a mechanistic concept of nature' and the revulsion against the assumption of purposeful forces"; let's call it for short "pro-mechanism and anti-teleology." (We leave to one side for the moment our natural question as to why these two are joined by an "and.") "Pro-mechanism and anti-teleology," then, can come out as a kind of polytheism and in modernity actually does so. Doubtless one is to think of the improvident atoms, of careless gravity and electromagnetism, as a modern kind of gods. So, pro-mechanism and anti-teleology comes out in modernity as a kind of polytheism; and it does this "out of the Bible's spirit of 'personalistic piety.'" Now this is harder. Perhaps this means that it is from the point of view of, or in reaction against, the Bible's spirit that mechanistic metaphysics comes out as polytheism. Take either as a working hypothesis. Now we have only to figure out how this fact-the fact that from the Biblical point of view, or in reaction against the Biblical point of view, modern mechanistic metaphysics comes out as a kind of polytheism- can be said to offset a certain loss, namely the break with revealed religion caused by modern mechanistic metaphysics. If at this point we cannot help noticing that we ourselves are lost, it is not Strauss who got us into this fix. His sentence reads:</page><page sequence="19">BOOK REVIEWS 281 ... aber dieser Verlust wird dadurch aufgewogen, dass gerade aus dem Geist der "personalistischen Fr6mmigkeit" der Bibel die "Neigung zu mechan- istischer Auffasung der Natur," die Perhorreszierung der Annahme nach Zwecken handelnder Krifte als "einer Art von Polytheismus" hervorgehen kann und in der Neuzeit tatsfichlich hervorgegangen ist. (p. 33) It means: But this loss is offset by the fact that it is precisely from the spirit of the "per- sonalistic piety" of the Bible that the "tendency to a mechanistic conception of nature," the horrified rejection, as a "kind of polytheism," of the supposition of forces acting teleologically, can arise and, in modern times, has in fact arisen. This rather changes things. In Strauss's version the ancient, not the modern, conception of nature is "a kind of polytheism"-the "gods" in question are the "purposeful forces" of teleological philosophy, not the purposeless forces of mechanistic philosophy; pro-mechanism, i.e. (not "and"!) anti- teleology, does not "come out as polytheism" but "comes out of, arises from, the Bible's spirit of personalistic piety." This anti-teleology comes out of the Bible's spirit of personalistic piety because in that spirit the purposeful forces of teleological philosophy appear as rivals or alternatives to the will of the one God; and this fact-the fact that it is precisely from the spirit of the personalistic piety of the Bible that modern mechanistic philosophy can arise and in fact has arisen-offsets the "loss," the break with revealed religion brought about by the mechanistic transformation of metaphysics in modernity, by showing that this mechanistic transformation is so far from incompatible with the Bible's spirit of personalistic piety that it can arise from and actually has arisen from that very spirit. Here again, the unwary reader of the translation has been led down a path of errors that will never converge with Strauss's argument. Strauss himself is justly famous for the exacting standards of accuracy that he observed in translation. In Philosophie und Gesetz he translated as follows Avicenna's definition, in his treatise "On the Parts of the Sciences," of the subject matter of politics: This part of practical philosophy (viz. politics) has as its subject matter [a] the</page><page sequence="20">282 BOOK REVIEWS existence of prophecy and [b] the dependence of the human race on the reli- gious law for its existence, its stability, and its propagation.4 [The last three "its" refer to "the human race."] According to Baumann's translation, Strauss says that Avicenna says: This part of practical philosophy (namely, politics) has as its subject [a] the presence of prophecy and [b] man's dependency with respect to this presence, its duration and its propagation in the religious law. (p. 101) Since "with respect to this presence, its duration and its propagation in the religious law" neither corresponds to Strauss's text nor makes any sense on its own account, one will never learn from the English translation that according to Avicenna "the dependence of the human race on the religious law" is a subject matter of politics. And without this key definition of the subject matter of politics, it is no wonder if Strauss's larger argument in this important passage on Maimonides' teaching about prophecy seems obscure. In a passage where Strauss argues that a decisive defect of modern "philosophy of religion" is that, because it proceeds from "consciousness" rather than from "nature," it is unable to conceive of God as "the creator of the world," Baumann makes Strauss remark that "it cannot 'discover' God as the Creator from the cosmos, but rather only from consciousness" (p. 29). The reader will wonder what Strauss is getting at in this blithe self- contradiction; for if he is admitting that modern philosophy of religion can discover God as the Creator (albeit from consciousness rather than from the cosmos), why is he objecting to it on the grounds that it can't? But again, it is not Strauss's argument that is baffling or confused. What he actually says is that modern philosophy of religion "cannot 'discover' God from the cosmos, [and thus] as the Creator, but only from consciousness"5-and thus in quite another character than that of "the Creator"! Strauss speaks of a certain moment in history when the old concept of 4.

According to the translation, Strauss says: Only because of this was the attempt to ground the modern ideal, the ideal of civilization by means of modern natural science, temporarily possible. It was believed that the new concept of nature was the adequate foundation of the old ideal. But this was a delusion. (p. 15) But this unintelligible assertion cannot be traced to Philosophie und Gesetz, where Strauss makes a perfectly lucid statement which means: The only reason why the attempt to ground the modern ideal, the ideal of civilization, by means of natural science was temporarily possible was that one believed that the new concept of nature was the adequate foundation for the new ideal just because the old concept of nature had been the adequate foun- dation of the old ideal. But one was deluding oneself.6 Baumann's translation will perplex readers by calling the Jewish tradi- tion an "instance" (p. 33), historical research an "example" (p. 35), and reason an "instance" (p. 46), where Strauss in each case is speaking of a tri- bunal or court or arbiter or judicial authority: the Jewish tradition is a premodern tribunal,7 historical research is a modern tribunal,8 and reason is the tribunal that (self-evidently, for a rationalist) must settle the conflict between reason and revelation.9 It is easy enough to surmise that the origin 6. "Nur darum auch war der Versuch zeitweilig m6glich, das moderne Ideal, das Ideal der Zivilisation, mittels der modernen Naturwissenschaft zu begrfinden: man glaubte, der neue Naturbegriff sei das zulingliche Fundament fifr das neue Ideal, da ja der alte Naturbegriff das zulingliche Fundament des alten Ideals gewesen war.

Baumann omits the phrase "fiber die Gefahr eben dieses Verrats" from his version, which thus comes out: "the moderns are unambiguously instructed by a modern example, namely, their own historical research," instead of "the moderns are unambiguously instructed by a modern tribunal, namely, their own historical research, about the danger of this very betrayal" (p. 35). 9. "... durch ihn die Instanz bestimmt wird, die den Konflikt zwischen Vernunft und</page><page sequence="22">284 BOOK REVIEWS of the mistake here'0 was the superficial similarity between the German word Instanz and the English word "instance." But even if one didn't know at the outset what Instanz actually means, our rule of translation would lead one to find it out. For "reason is the instance that must settle the conflict between reason and revelation" (p. 46) is a proposition that makes no sense; but Strauss is presumed to have written sense; therefore, there is a presumption of error in the translation. In a discussion of Gersonides' views on whether human intellect is suffi- cient to know everything that man has a natural desire to know, Baumann's translation presents Strauss's argument as follows. Since the question "created world or eternal world?" is the decisive one, and since Gersonides' reason for holding that human intellect suffices to answer this question establishes the sufficiency of human intellect to answer all questions for whose answer man has a natural desire, "consequently, Maimonides asserts the insufficiency of human intellect just as generally" (p. 73). But this aston- ishing "consequence" is of course not drawn by Strauss, who believed neither that Gersonides (1288-1344) lived before Maimonides (1135-1204) nor that Maimonides' reasonings were the consequence of the future reason- ings of his yet-unborn successor. What Strauss says is that since the question "created or eternal world?" is central, and since Gersonides' reason for hold- ing that human intellect suffices to answer this question establishes in princi- ple the sufficiency of human intellect to answer all questions for whose answer man has a natural desire, "and since Maimonides on the contrary asserts the insufficiency of the human intellect [not only for this question but] in general as well,-consequently it must be said that Gersonides is opposing his assertion of sufficiency against Maimonides' assertion of insuffi- ciency."" Offenbarung zu schlichten hat. Diese Instanz ist-fiir einen Rationalisten selbstverstiindlich- die Vernunft" (P&amp;G, pp. 54-55). Baumann: "through it the instance is determined that must settle the conflict between reason and Revelation. This instance (self-evident for a rationalist) is reason" (p. 46). 10. Cf also p. 46, "cases of truth" for "Wahrheitsinstanzen" (P&amp;G, p. 54): "courts of truth, arbiters of truth." 11.

Baumann attributes to Strauss the statement that for Guttmann "the problem of religious truth, like the prob- lem of the relationship of the theoretical to the religious consciousness of truth, becomes..,. the central problem of the 'philosophy of religion' " (pp. 51-52); but Strauss does not say that one thing, "like" another thing, is the central thing; he says rather that "the problem of religious truth, [under- stood] as the problem of the relationship between theoretical and religious truth-consciousness, becomes for him the central problem of 'philosophy of religion.' "14 These examples of unintelligible propositions in Philosophy and Law are, regrettably, only a small sampling of the difficulties in store for its reader. But what has been shown about them is true of all the others as well: each arises from a plain error in translation; none correctly represents Strauss's own words. The reader can therefore take it as a rule that every time an unintelligible proposition occurs in the translation, he will find the solution in the original. This rule is easy enough to apply because unintelligible propositions are self-identifying. Unfortunately, the translation is also marred by errors that will be harder for the Germanless reader to identify, because, while incorrect, they are not manifestly absurd. For example, Baumann makes Strauss say that the "'philosophy of religion' of the medieval Jewish rationalists . . . deserves Guttman's depic- tion of it as rationalistic" (p. 42). Although this sentence violates no canon 12. "... sie wird nicht vom menschlichen Denken zugrunde gelegt, sondern sie ist zuvor dem menschlichen Denken auferlegt." P&amp;G, p. 47. 13.

Strauss, so far from expressing his own judg- ment on the medieval Jewish rationalists' philosophy of religion, states that according to Guttmann's account it deserves to be characterized as rational- ist.'5 And this is the very account of Guttmann's that Strauss, so far from agreeing with, goes on to describe as "shockingly unintelligible" (see above in the present essay). In a similar vein, Baumann speaks of Guttmann as "he who, appropriately, recognizes the Jewish tradition as the judge over modern thought" (p. 51). But Strauss, so far from commending Guttmann's recognition as "appropriate," accuses Guttmann of an inconsistency between what he purports to recognize and what he actually recognizes: he refers to Guttmann as he "who in fact recognizes the Jewish tradition as the judge over modern thought."'6 Where Strauss quotes Guttmann as saying that according to Saadia there can be no contradiction between reason and revelation,'7 Baumann (perhaps thinking this too strong a claim?) reduces it to the statement that according to Saadia "there is no contradiction" (p. 42).I" Such reversals of what Strauss unambiguously says "is in fact" the case with what he says "follows" logically or "is possible" all too frequently misrepresent the sense of Strauss's argument. Errors of this plausible sort are likely to mislead the unwary again and again. To take some examples, Baumann speaks of "a predetermined Aris- totelian, or rather Platonic, way of thinking" (p. 35) where Strauss speaks of "the predetermining Aristotelian, or rather neo-Platonic, way of think- ing."l'9 Strauss says that according to Alfarabi God grants20 revelations to 15.

Baumann here as elsewhere incautiously relies on David Silverman's translation (Julius Guttmann, Philosophies of Judaism [New York: Schocken, 1973]) for passages from Guttman's Die Philosophie des Judentums quoted by Strauss in Philosophie und Gesetz. For instance, in the face of Strauss's emphatic warning that "an essential modification of the historical evidence results from the very use of the concept of 'religion'" ("eine wesentliche Modifikation des ge- schichtlichen Tatbestandes allein mit der Verwendung des 'Religions'-Begriffs... gegeben ist," P&amp;G, p. 58), Baumann reproduces Silverman's transformation of Guttmann's "Jewish premises of belief" ("der jiidischen Glaubensvorstellungen," P&amp;G, p. 32, n. 1) into "Jewish reli- gious ideas" (Baumann, p. 115, n. 12). 19.

Besides mistranslations which are unintelligible on their face and those which are more specious though no less wrong, Philosophy and Law has the misfortune of being marred by blemishes of English usage which, while not always misleading as to the argument, strangely misrepresent the elegance and force of Strauss's writing. In standard English one does not say "a prin- cipled misunderstanding" (p. 9) for "a misunderstanding in principle"; "research of something" (p. 23) for "research on something"; "the under- standing preservation" of a thing (p. 32) for "the intellectual preservation" of a thing; "it characteristically distinguished itself" (p. 40) for "its specific difference is"; "the opinion of Revelation" (p. 40) for "the meaning of Reve- lation"; "even in the case that he can know" (p. 51) for "even in case [=if] he can know"; "the enlightenment of the presupposition" (p. 58) for "the explanation of the presupposition"; "the mediation of their knowledge" (p. 88) for "the indirectness of their knowledge"; a "theorist" (p. 98) for a "theoretical man"; "partial in transcendent ideals" (p. 113) for "partial to transcendent ideals"; "a gradual distinction" (p. 119) for "a difference in degree." Many of these are errors the reader on a moment's reflection may silently correct for himself; most will not materially mislead. It is unfortu- nate, though, that they give such a dismal impression of Strauss's manner of writing. The reader who turns to the German original of this book, or to any of Strauss's English books, will discover there an author whose masterful rhetorical art is one of the lavish encouragements with which he refreshes us in the study of his challenging works.
