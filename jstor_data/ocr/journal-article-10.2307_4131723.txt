Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997. xxiii, 188 pp. One of the lesser-studied aspects of modern Jewish history is the margin that thinly separates the origin from the destination of the great migrations of Eastern European Jews to America. The experience of Jews in the New World has been well documented, and increasing numbers of studies of turn-of-the-twentieth-cen- tury Russian Jewish history have appeared. Most of these works, however, treated the mass movement of Jews as either a concluding chapter of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement or as a completely new beginning: the Jewish experience in the Unit- ed States and Canada. Steven Cassedy's To the Other Shore examines the genera- tions on the seam of the great migrations-the people who formed the bridge be- tween the shtetl and the sweatshops, translating, with varying levels of success, Russian Jewish culture into American English. A theme that runs through To the Other Shore is the culturally fluid nature of these immigrants, which Cassedy illustrates with a wide variety of vignettes from autobiographical materials. A strong element of Russification had already been impressed on their worldviews, and many had adopted nontraditional atti- tudes long before leaving the shtetl. Many had an exceptionally antagonistic atti- tude toward Judaism, and in this Morris Winchevsky's memoirs are typical: "For me," he writes, "and not for me alone in those days, unbelief and hatred for any kind of faith had reached the highest degree of fanaticism. It became hard for me to pass a bes medresh ... without gnashing my teeth in anger, and I could hardly stand to hear the voice of men praying or studying a page of Talmud" (p. 13). Students of the American Jewish experience will find Cassedy's work par- ticularly useful for its description of the bizarre intellectual currents popular in the late tsarist period. Special attention is devoted to Nikolai Chernyshevsky's classic, almost unreadable, What Is to Be Done?, a rambling work of fiction in which uni- dimensional characters devote their lives to the cause of transforming society at its most fundamental level. What Is to Be Done? was mandatory reading for all bud- ding socialists; Lenin later consciously adopted the title for one of his most sig- nificant political treatises, and as the Jewish ideologue Chaim Zhitlovsky de- scribed Chernishevsky's impact on Jews: "He became in the literal sense of the word our rebbe, our leader, our er zol lebn ... and we, his ardent Hasidim. ... [ What Is to Be Done?] could almost be added to the ranks of the sacred scriptures of mankind: the Bible, the Gospels, the Koran ... people approached What Is to Be Done? as they would the Zohar ... because they expected to discover in it the sisre-toyre [mysteries of the Torah]" (p. 29). Cassedy also provides fascinating glimpses into Russian counter-cultural movements, such as nihilism and populism, and traces their influence on the bud- ding secular Jewish intelligentsia as it emerged from traditional rabbinic culture in the late nineteenth century. One of the more significant observations that Cassedy makes in this valuable work is that these Jewish intellectuals "did not for a imnute cease thinking of themselves as Russians," and were forced to "recognize and af- firm their Jewishness, if only for the pragmatic purpose of gaining a political au- dience among their fellow Jews" (p. 62). While discussing their considerable con- 396</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews tributions to the development of American intellectual life, particularly in New York, Cassedy argues that the mind-set of these immigrants was, Jewishly speak- ing, a failure: "Over and over again they had asserted their status as Russians and had been so successful that native-born Americans thought of them primarily as Russians. Over and over again they had shied away from acknowledging the Jew- ishness of their readers, even when those readers were reading them in a language that almost no one except Jews could understand [i.e., Yiddish]. When they had moved into the world of English-language publishing, many of them abandoned all traces of their Jewish identity" (pp. 158-159). To the Other Shore is essential reading for students of American Jewish his- tory and culture, and very important for specialists on Eastern Europe. Cassedy's fluid style will make this well-illustrated work useful in undergraduate classes. Henry Abramson Florida Atlantic University Boca Raton, Florida</page></plain_text>
