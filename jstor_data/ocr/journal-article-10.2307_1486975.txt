<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yehuda Bauer. Out of the Ashes (The Impact of American Jews on Post- Holocaust European Jewry). Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1989. xv, 319 pp. This is presumably the last volume of Yehuda Bauer's series dealing with the activities of the American Joint Distribution Committee during the Holocaust. Together with My Brother's Keeper (1974) and American Jewry and the Holocaust (1980), Out of the Ashes provides a meticulously detailed log of the involvement of the world's largest and most important Jewish social service agency in the central event of modern European Jewish his- tory. At first glance, an institutional history might seem to be an odd under- taking for one of the world's foremost historians of the Holocaust, and three volumes rather a lot for a limited topic. As the title of the second volume of the trilogy and the subtitle of the third indicate, however, Bauer sees the story of the Joint as that of American Jewry and the Holocaust writ small. Bauer writes history with the tools of the caterpillar; but he seeks thereby to attain the perspective of the butterfly. Together these volumes constitute a major contribution to one of the central debates of Holocaust historiography: the role of American Jewry during the World War II period. Both pop and serious historians have claimed that American Jews remained willfully ignorant of the fate of Jews under the Nazis. Their Jewish loyalties sapped by life in the gilded ghetto, the argument goes, American Jews did no more than the minimum to assist their European brethren. Consequently, they deserve a major portion of the blame for the catastrophe that occurred. Bauer never claims that American Jews might not have done more. He shows, however, that the Joint and other American organizations, as well as</page><page sequence="2">358 BOOK REVIEWS individuals, were certainly not indifferent to their brethren in Europe. In the earlier volumes he illustrates the relative powerlessness of the American Jewish elite, who were the lay captains of the Joint, to affect American policy in any substantive way during the war. In Out of the Ashes he demon- strates conclusively that in the immediate postwar period American Jews, and especially those of the Joint, "understood their Jewish responsibility" (p. 297). Largely thanks to the work of the Joint, "the survivors were en- abled to rebuild their lives, . . . immigration to Palestine-Israel could take place before and after 1948, [and] ... hope and a measure of trust in Jewish solidarity was [sic] again instilled into the surviving communities" (p. 298). Bauer makes clear that the Joint could not do all that was demanded of it. Eastern European Jews were accustomed to thinking of American resources as unlimited. And after all that they had suffered, many of them naturally felt the Americans had an obligation to assist in any way they were asked. Survivors in many locations complained that the Joint was slow to provide needed food and clothing, and that clothes were often unwearable. That the American and British armies obstructed Joint shipments or that clothing had been shipped without inspection because of the desire for speed was not understood. The Orthodox continually complained of receiving less than their due, although rivalries among factions made it almost impossible to satisfy demands relating to kashrut, education, and other matters. Survi- vors generally wanted to control their own affairs and supplies; and Joint officials generally agreed that they should. At the same time, the survivors sometimes criticized Joint officials for not protecting them from the indiffer- ence, callousness, and even antisemitism of some American army personnel. Together with American army chaplains and representatives of other American Jewish organizations, such as HIAS (the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and ORT (the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training), Joint officials gingerly and sensitively negotiated these shoals, providing the material needs, the moral and medical support, and the organizational expertise required for the initial rehabilitation of the survivors and their eventual emigration from Europe. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Joint's work was its involve- ment in aliyah. In the earlier two volumes, Bauer discusses at length both the non-Zionist history of the Joint and the conviction of its upper-middle- class laymen that its activities must always be within the law. In the 1920s, when the Joint supported Jewish agricultural settlements in the Soviet Union, and in the 1930s, when it strove to protect its share of United Jewish Appeal funds, the Joint was viewed as an enemy by Zionists in America and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 359 Palestine. During the 1940s, the legalistic thinking of its directors was thought by many to be nothing other than a death sentence for Europe's Jews delivered callously and carelessly. During the period covered by Out of the Ashes, however, the Joint became the ally of Zionism and the financial mainstay of both legal and illegal aliyah. It was a remarkable transforma- tion, which reflected the Zionization of American Jewry (and of the surviv- ing remnant in Europe) in the wake of the Holocaust, as well as the hope- lessness of Jewish life in Europe, especially in the east, and the fact that the doors to other countries, including the United States, remained locked to Jews. Bauer's works will probably not put an end to the debate over the role of American Jewry during World War II. Their focus is somewhat narrow for the broad conclusions to be drawn with finality. More needs to be written about organizations other than the Joint, particularly Zionist organizations; and the social context in which the leading Jewish organizations functioned needs to be examined. Out of the Ashes and the two volumes which preceded it will, however, permanently undermine the generalizations of the opposing school. Bauer's detailed, careful documentation of the work of the Joint will, at the least, force the America-bashers to rethink their position. One serious reservation, not about the substance of Out of the Ashes but about its style, must be made. In his earlier works Bauer wrote with ele- gance. This volume, however, is marred by infelicitous language and incor- rect usage, frequent repetitions, and the confusing presentation of numerical data. Perhaps the only touch of humor is provided by a mistranslation: pintele yid, "quintessential Jew," is rendered as, "the Jewish point" (p. 230). In this book the medium is not the message. It is a pity, however, that such painstaking scholarship could not have been presented with the greatest clarity and with Bauer's usual grace.
