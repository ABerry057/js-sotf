<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE UNKNOWN PIYYUTIM BY DAVID BEN HASIN by ANDRE E. ELBAZ and EPHRAIM HAZAN David Ben Hasin (1727-1792) is the most celebrated poet of Moroccan Jewry.' His piyyutirm were already popular during his lifetime, not only in his native city of Meknes, but all over Morocco, as evidenced by his frequent visits to distant Jewish communities (including Gibraltar, in southern Spain) where he was regularly invited to sing his compositions.2 Contemporary poets wrote songs of praise in his honor while he was still alive, as well as elegies lamenting his death.3 To this day, David Ben Hasin's piyyutimn remain remarkably popular among Moroccan Jews.

ELBAZ and EPHRAIM HAZAN piyyutim, whether printed or in manuscript form, include large numbers of his compositions. His popularity is such that several of his poems have served as models for many interesting imitations. Thus, 'Ohil Yom Yom Eshta'e,4 David Ben Hasin's famous piyyut celebrat- ing the glory of the city of Tiberias, inspired several well-known compositions. In Shir Yedidot, the most popular Moroccan poetic anthology, its tune and pattern are followed in 'Ashira shir behlibba,5 an anonymous poem in honor of Rabbi Akiva, and 'Ohil Yom, a song written by the Holy Land emissary Eliahu Hazan in praise of Jerusalem,6 both of which reproduce whole phrases from David Ben Hasin's piyyut. A matruz, or bilingual poem, alternates David Ben Hasin's Hebrew stanzas with Judeo-Arabic ones.7 Another poem alternates the original stanzas with other Hebrew ones that glorify Rabbi Shim'on Bar Yohay.8 David Ben Hasin spent the last twelve years of his life preparing the manuscript of an anthology of about two hundred of his poems, and trying at the same time to secure financial help for its publication. His diwan, Tehilla leDavid, was eventually published in Amsterdam in 1807, fifteen years after his death. In the nineteenth century, Tehilla leDavid became immensely popular throughout North Africa, and its success spread to Jewish communities in the Middle East and the Orient. Significantly, several of his compositions found their way into the Sephardic liturgy.9 In 1931, a direct descendant of the poet, Aharon Ben Hasin, published a second edition and by Hayyim David Serero, 'Ashira na livedidi, in Tehilla leDavid (Amsterdam, 1807), p. Ir. After the death of David Ben Hasin, elegies were composed by poets like Aharon Ben Simhon (MS copy kindly provided by Raphael Ben Simhon, in Jerusalem) and Shelomo Halewa (MS JTS 1237), pp. 147r-149r.

In the nineteenth century, David Ben Hasin's piyyutim were popularized by shadarainm, or itinerant emissaries from Eres Israel, like Raphael Ohana, born in Meknes, emissary from Tiberias to the Far East in 1886. See his book Sefer tovat mar'e (Jerusalem, 1896), pp. 96r-96v. Some of these piyyutinz were printed in Sefer Pizmonim, an anthology published in Calcutta, India, in 1842.

Among North African and other Oriental Jews, the most popular azharot are two eleventh-century works from Spain, Shemor libbi ma'ane, composed by Shelomo Ibn Gabirol, and 'Ei ze meqom bina, by Yishaq Ben Reuben Al- Bargeloni. Another category of azharot, usually sung during other festivals, outline the commandments related to some specific question. The azharot of David Ben Hasin, who was influenced by the Spanish masters,59 are of this type. He composed his azharot, as well as their two introductory preludes, Yishtabbah hayoser veyitpa'ar habore and Lekhu shim 'lu va'asappera, to the tunes of Yishaq Ben Reuben Al-Bargeloni's azharot and their reshuyot, 49. Cf. Num 21:22. Here the poet means the way of the Lord, who is the King of the universe. 50. Cf. Ps. 45:14. 51. Cf. Ps. 16:5. 52. Cf. Ps. 55:23. 53. Cf. Lam. 4:22. 54. Cf. Ps. 122:7. 55. The Temple of Jerusalem, as in Isa. 29:1. 56. Cf. Ps. 14:7. 57. This piyvut was meant to be sung after the complete recitation of David Ben Hasin's azharot. 58. Azharot: Tefilla leDavid, in Tehilla leDavid, pp. 62v-68r. 59. Cf. the azharot of Yehuda Halevi on the laws of Pesah, Hiqqabesu veshim 'u bnei Ya'aqov, in Heinrich Brody, ed., Diwan ... Yehuda Ben Shenmu'el Halevi (Berlin, 1894-1930), 4:53. On the azharot genre, see Ephraim Hazan and Binyamin Bar-Tikva, Shirat hahalakha (Ramat-Gan, 1991).</page><page sequence="10">96 ANDRE E. ELBAZ and EPHRAIM HAZAN or introductory poems, 'Alo 'ala Moshe and Yom ze horid. Following the model of Al-Bargeloni's azharot, each stanza ends with a biblical quotation. Moreover, the first words of David Ben Hasin's azharot ('eizohi derekh yeshara) are reminiscent of the beginning of Al-Bargeloni's azharot ('ei ze meqom bina). Our three unpublished piyyutim show that David Ben Hasin attached great importance to his azharot, and in fact thought of them as a separate work, as evidenced by their distinct title page in both the Amsterdam and Casablanca editions of Tehilla leDavid. Like a traditional preface to a sacred book, the first introductory poem, Yishtabbahl hayoser veyitpa'ar habore, starts with the customary tribute to the Creator. The initial letters of the words in the first line, as well as the first letters of the four stanzas, spell the name of God (nr'''). The content of this poem is predictable: The poet first praises the omniscience, infinite wisdom, and justice of the One and Only Creator, then the Torah, which is the subject matter of the azharot, and finally the people of Israel, who put their trust in God and accept the yoke of the Torah. The second poem, Lekhu shim 'u va'asappera, constitutes the reshut (prelude) that leads the reader to the text of David Ben Hasin's azharot, which list the laws of sisit and tfillin. This poem is therefore similar to various piyyutimn where Ben Hasin speaks of the commandment of tfillin or of the Bar Mitzvah ceremony. The first line, Lekhu shimt'u va'asappera, qehal 'adat Yeshurun, is typical of such didactic poems. It urges the people of Israel to listen to the commandments spelled out in the azharot, and it specifically emphasizes the importance of the laws of tfillin and sisit. Each stanza ends with the biblical refrain: "As God commanded Moses and Aaron."60 In the last stanza, the poet invites his readers to publicly intone his azharot, which proclaim the greatness of God's commandments. After the text of David Ben Hasin's azharot, we find our third unpublished poem, Yahid 'ein bilto 'ahee; on the suffering of exile and the yearning for redemption. It is an ancient Jewish tradition to end a homily or a session of Torah study with the recitation of a prayer for deliverance that starts with the biblical verse "And a Redeemer shall come to Zion,"61 and with the Qaddish, where the faithful pray that God "may establish His kingdom, cause His salvation to spring forth, and hasten the coming of His Messiah." 60. Cf. Exod. 12:28. 61. Cf. Isa. 59:20, which is also the beginning of the well-known prayer recited during the Shabbat minhah service.</page><page sequence="11">THREE UNKNOWN PIYYUTIM BY DAVID BEN HASIN 97 This explains the presence of the refrain "Let the Redeemer come to Zion!" at the end of each stanza. David Ben Hasin's style and occasional use of Aramaic reflect the scholarly character of azharot poetry. He denounces the cruel suffering of Israel in exile, but at the same time has no doubt that the redemption will come, as he states at the beginning and end of the poem. These three unpublished piyyutim are typical of David Ben Hasin's poetry, which in part continues the tradition of the great medieval Spanish poets.62 On the other hand, in its own distinctive way, it uses the language of Scripture and of rabbinical sources, including the language of halakhah and Talmud. Essentially religious, this poetry depicts the traditional Jewish way of life. It is also a national poetry which portrays the terrifying oppression of the Jewish people and its yearning for deliverance.63 Yahid 'ein bilto aher is a cry of anguish in the face of inhuman persecution, where the poet does not hesitate to take the Almighty to task for chastising the children of Israel much more than they deserve, and for allowing their oppressors to torment and slaughter them at will. Israel's only consolation lies in its hope for the speedy coming of the messianic era. Carleton University Ottawa, Ont. Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel 62. On the reshut genre in classical Spanish poetry, see Ezra Fleischer, Hebrew Liturgical Poetry in the Middle Ages [Heb.] (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 395-402. 63. The pervasive presence in the reshuyot of the "national" themes of the suffering of Israel in exile and its messianic hopes is also typical of Spanish poetry. Ibid., p. 401.</page></plain_text>
