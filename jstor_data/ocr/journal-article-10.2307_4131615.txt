<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christine Hayes. Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities. Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 2002. 309 pp. Jonathan Klawans recently argued that there are two distinct types of purity in the Bible: ritual and moral. In biblical texts, the impurity of Gentiles is not ritual, but moral (the exception being corpse impurity, to which Gentiles are sus- ceptible). Moral impurity is not contagious and is not subject to rites of purifica- tion. In the first section of her recently published work on Gentile impurities, Christine Hayes further categorizes impurity by introducing two types of purity considered to be intrinsic to Gentiles by some second temple groups: genealogi- cal and carnal. Genealogical impurity is an impurity intrinsic to a nationality/race and can- not be cleansed through conversion or assimilation. The idea that Gentiles are in- trinsically profane is introduced into Israelite ideology by Ezra, who conceives of all of Israel as a holy seed, a concept ascribed only to priests in the Torah and Ezekiel. The idea is further developed in Jubilees and 4QMMT which, in Hayes's reading, prohibit and polemicize against intermarriage and are intolerant of any form of conversion. Paul theorizes a new form of impurity, which Hayes dubs "carnal impurity." This type of impurity is contagious, and is passed from the flesh of a nonbeliever to a believer through sexual union. While Paul obviously believes in conversion, 325</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews he does not envision the possibility of intermarriage between the holy flesh of the believer, and the defiled flesh of the nonbeliever. In such a manner, Paul adopts the Ezran idea of holy seed, and transforms it to meet his concept of the holy flesh (flesh which is imbued with the holy spirit). After documenting pre-rabbinic concepts of Gentile impurities, Hayes turns her attention to a contextual description of rabbinic attitudes toward these impuri- ties. In these chapters, Hayes disputes Gedalyahu Alon's theory that as Gentile rit- ual impurity was actually biblical (with its basis in the ritually-defiling power of idols), when the rabbis declare that Gentile ritual impurity is of rabbinic origin it is an attempt to soften the impact of the ancient law. In contrast to Alon, Hayes demonstrates that the rabbis understood well that Gentiles were excluded from the ritual purity laws of Leviticus 12-15, and that al- though there was some debate on corpse impurity, the rabbis did not include Gen- tiles in their torahitic purity laws. Whereas Alon posited three different types of Gentile impurity in rabbinic texts (sherets, zav, and corpse) corresponding to three types of idol impurity, Hayes shows that only zav impurity is rabbinically attrib- uted to Gentiles. For Hayes, the impurity of Gentiles in rabbinic texts is clearly of rabbinic origin. In all of these points, Hayes's arguments are persuasive. In my opinion, her argument that the rabbis considered idols to be only rabbinically rit- ually impure demands further consideration. Unlike Gentile impurity, which is ex- plicitly attributed to rabbinic decree, the impurity of idols is learned exegetically, from verses such as "You shall cast them away [idols] as a menstruous thing" (Isa 30:22) or "You must utterly abominate them [shaqqets teshaqqetsu] it [i.e. an idol]" (Dt 7:26). Modern scholars may not understand these verses as comparing the ritual impurity of idols with the ritual impurity of the niddah or sheqqets, but at least some rabbis may have interpreted them so. While the ritual impurity of idols may be of rabbinic origin historically, it remains to be proved that the rabbis themselves conceived of it as such. The final two chapters of Hayes's book turn to two issues related to the im- purity of Gentiles: intermarriage and conversion. The rabbis reject the "holy seed" concept of Israel, and erect permeable barriers between Jews and Gentiles, barri- ers open to conversion. Sexual relations with Gentiles, while forbidden, do not car- nally defile (as they do for Paul). In general, Palestinian rabbis preach against intermarriage in subtle tones. Hayes puts to rest the idea that Gentile ritual impu- rity impeded intermarriage between Jews and Gentiles. She suggests the opposite: by constructing the principle of Gentile impurity the rabbis "signaled their dis- agreement with alternative characterizations of Gentiles and the consequences of interethnic sexual relations." In her conclusion she goes even further and claims, "the decree of Gentile ritual impurity was less a strategy for eliminating the evil of miscegenation than a volley in the internal cultural wars of first-century Ju- daism." However, there is little evidence to back these speculative statements. In the end, having portrayed the rabbis as lenient on the different forms of Gentile im- purity, it is difficult for Hayes to explain why they did, after all, declare them to bear some form of impurity. In the final chapter, Hayes traces a progressive leniency in allowing descen- dents of converts to marry into the priesthood and forbidding them from marrying 326</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews mamzers. The reason for such progression lies in a further distancing from the Ezran/Jubilees/4QMMT application of holy seed ideology to all of Israel. Pales- tinian rabbis curtailed the application of this ideology even with regard to the priesthood, almost against Leviticus itself, which does prohibit the profanation of priestly seed. Hayes locates a potential cause for this shift in the supreme value of Torah learning in rabbinic circles; as position in the bet midrash rose as a deter- mining factor in status, genealogical descent correspondingly dropped. It is inter- esting to note that while Hayes detects a decline in the import ofyius in the rabbinic period, Michael Satlow recently came to an opposite conclusion: the rabbis actu- ally created marital castes. Such differing conclusions might be attributed to the highlighting of different strands of the rabbinic tradition, a tradition which cannot easily be typified. They also remind us that interpretation is often a function of the choice of a starting point. Whatever the case, Hayes's exhaustively researched and articulately argued work on Gentile impurity will surely be the starting point for all future inquiries into the subject. Hayes has deeply enriched our knowledge of how the impurity of Gentiles functioned in the formation of identity by Jewish sects in antiquity. The fact that one may question some of her conclusions and supplement others does not in any way detract from the brilliance of her work.
