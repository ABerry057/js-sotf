<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chava Weissler. Voices of the Matriarch.- Listening to Prayers of Early Modern Jewish Women. Boston: Beacon Press, 1988. xxvi, 267 pp. For more than a decade, Chava Weissler has called on readers to listen to the voices of matriarchs. Her numerous articles on tkhines-Yiddish prayers for pri- vate devotion typically recited by women of early modernity-have appeared in a wide variety of academic and, to a much lesser extent, popular publications. At once folklorist, ethnographer, literary critic, and student of classical Jewish texts and mysticism, Weissler has time and again applied her training in elite fields of learning to non-elite sources. While initially interested in merely "recover[ing] women's religious experience and contrast[ing] it to men's," her objectives have broadened over the years to include "understanding the tkhines within the matrix of Ashkenazic Judaism" (pp. xii-xiii). Most recently, Weissler has turned to inter- preting how tkhines influenced twentieth-century Jewish religious life in commu- nities as diverse as Conservative Jewry and feminist ritual groups. In essence, Voices of the Matriarchs is an anthology consisting of Weissler's previously published articles on tkhines. Of the ten chapters, only the seventh (an exhaustive study of the tkhine author Leah Horowitz and her works) was composed expressly for this volume. As a result, most of the chapters, while interesting and important in and of themselves, are self-contained and bear little relation to the others. Additionally, background information is repeated in various spots, and even the author's style is not consistent throughout the book. So, for instance, Weissler addresses the general reader in a fascinating essay tracing portrayals of women in paradise from the Zohar to the tkhine literature, but she addresses the academic reader in a sophisticated discussion of how gender is constructed in Ashkenazic sources.1 In many ways, Voices of the Matriarchs resembles the Essential Papers 1. The first appeared originally as "Women in Paradise," Tikkun 2 (April-May, 1987): 43-46, 117-120; the second as "For Women and For Men: The Construction of Gender in Yiddish Devotion- al Literature," Journal ofFeminist Studies in Religion 5 (Fall, 1989): 3-24. 370</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews series published by New York University Press, which features a collection of ar- ticles devoted to a single subject from disparate approaches and authors. In fact, Chapter Six of Voices of the Matriarchs appears in Essential Papers in Kabbalah.2 Notwithstanding its structure, Voices of the Matriarchs makes a significant contribution to the study of religion. Indeed, Weissler's trenchant analysis of the rich array of tkhines prompts a rewriting of the religious history of the Ashkenaz- ic world of the Netherlands, the Germanic lands, Poland, and Russia from the six- teenth through the nineteenth century. She demonstrates that, though exempt from communal worship and generally ignorant of the classics of Jewish tradition, women were far more likely to be engaged in religious life than previously ac- knowledged. The hypothesis argued throughout is that the female segment of the Ashkenazic population was influenced by the scholarly and male formulation of Judaism but was also in part free of them. Thus Sarah bas Tovim-whose Shloyshe sheorim ("The Three Gates") became "perhaps the most beloved of all tkhines"- drew on popularizations of kabbalistic material in Yiddish but turned to women's folk rituals like kneytlakh legn ("laying wicks") to develop a paradigm of religious power (p. 126). Weissler leaves little doubt that women, too, participated in the overarching rhythm of Jewish life. In a powerful and refreshing concluding essay, Weissler offers an honest meditation on the personal implications of her scholarship and ultimately breaks with her hypothesis that Jewish women created any sort of religious culture inde- pendent of the male mainstream. In her words: "My efforts to define and valorize an Ashkenazic women's culture ... began to seem naive, as I recognized that the gender representations that controlled women's lives were enmeshed in the very fiber of Ashkenazic Judaism" (p. 175). Ultimately, she concluded, "The religious world we can infer from the tkhine literature is, essentially, a set of female variants of male Jewish culture" (pp. 185-188). In the end Weissler must admit that her earlier, perhaps idealistic, aim of unearthing women who created, shaped, or even influenced traditional Judaism has been thwarted by the evidence. Jewish women were essentially conforming to and accepting the basic values of the male-created and -dominated system into which they had been born. This discomfiting fact causes Weissler-as a scholar, as a woman, and as a Jew-to question her loyal- ty to Judaism and to the academy. No need. As one of a growing number of matriarchs who combine scholar- ly erudition and sensitivity to gender issues, hers is a voice that is transforming the very nature of Jewish studies and the power relations therein.
