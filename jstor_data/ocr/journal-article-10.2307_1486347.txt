<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMING HOME: THE PERSONAL BASIS OF SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY By ROBERT M. SELTZER Hunter College of the City University of New York In the mid-1930s, when the eminent Jewish historian Simon Dubnow began to publish his autobiography, he gave it the formidable title The Book of Life: Reminiscences and Reflections, Material for the History of My Time.' Drawing not only on his memory, but on copious diaries and a prodigious literary output going back to the 1880s, Dubnow traced his journey from shtetl Judaism to Jewish nationalism-a journey typical (one 1.

The substance of Dubnow's Book of Life frees the title from preten- tiousness; more than a mere compilation, much of the autobiography (es- pecially the first volume and a half) was an act of synthesis and integratsiia dushi ("self-integration"), two of Dubnow's favorite terms.2 My aim in this paper is to reflect anew on the process of Dubnow's self-integration, bridging the gap between a purely biographical approach and a purely ideological one in order to show how a distinctive nationalist stance crystal- lized out of Dubnow's personal growth. Nationalism was a hard-won, by no means self-evident solution to an overlapping sequence of emotional and intellectual dilemmas. Dubnow provides us with a picture of the grop- ing that this self-transformation entailed, a picture that can be supple- mented, and to a certain extent revised, by listening for resonances between life and thought undetected by Dubnow himself.3 Dubnow was born in the Belorussian town of Mstislavl on September 10, 1860 to a religiously observant, Yiddish-speaking family of some local prestige living on the edge of genteel poverty. Dubnow tells us that he re- volted early against the traditional Jewish educational pattern: he taught himself the rudiments of Russian and, after acquiring a Russian elementary schooling, left home on several futile attempts to qualify for the secondary- school certificate that would enable him to enter the university. Like many of his generation, he grew up without the direct experience of the re- pressive Nicholaevan regime and with the optimistic expectation that Rus- sia under Alexander II was beginning to let down its barriers against the Jews in order to make a place for them in its midst.4 The direct stimulus 2.

The title of Dubnow's autobiography al- ludes of course to the heavenly books annually balanced on the Days of Judgment. Frequently in his autobiography Dubnow integrates past and present through pausing to reflect on significant changes in his life and outlook, the effects of the passage of time on friends and places, and parallels between contemporary issues and his- torical events, e.g., KZ, I, 203, 244. The value of autobiography reoccurs in Dubnow's letters, especially to Ahad Ha-Am (Sefer Dubnow, pp. 275, 278, 288, 289, 316, 455). 3.

The Haskalah (which was already coming to an end as a phase of Jewish litera- ture) was about to have its most widespread and decisive impact on many youths of Dubnow's era, offering them a picture of the world in decided contrast to the actuality of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement. Through the travel books and novels (ranging from Mapu's depiction of the land of Israel in the time of the prophets to Eugene Sue's revelations of the mysteries of Paris), Dubnow early acquired a psychological distance from the shtetl. Having perceived his immediate Jewish environment from the perspective of other times and places, he easily adopted the specific recom- mendations of the maskilim: that he give up the "jargon" for pure biblical Hebrew and the vernacular language of the country, that he view heder and yeshivah as outmoded, that he strive to acquire scientific knowledge and reject any element of Judaism not in accordance with modern canons of reason.5 Although the Haskalah was the active force in pushing him to a new life, in the long run the Mstislavl cultural matrix formed the deeper levels of his character. We must assume that the infantile experience (unrecover- 5. Kalman Shulman's translation of Sue's novel was first published in four parts between 1854 and 1860. The impact of Mistorei Pariz is often mentioned in auto- biographies of Russian Jews of the second half of the nineteenth century.

Also see David Patterson, The Hebrew Novel in Czarist Russia, (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1964), p. 223; and his Abraham Mapu: The Creator of the Modern Hebrew Novel (London: East and West Library, 1964), p. 103. Mistorei Pariz impressed Dubnow and his brother Wolf so strongly that the boys decided to copy the whole work by hand before returning it to the owner, and actually managed to record the whole first volume in this way. After having read Abraham Mapu's two historical novels, 'Ashmat Shomrnron and 'Ahavat Tsiyon, they were able to locate in Mstislavl only the first volume of his 'Ayit Tsavu'a, a contemporary tale of the conflict between the maskilim and the traditionalists; they ordered the remaining parts from a local book- store and paid for them with money filched from the cashbox of their mother's store (KZ, I, 43). At the age of thirteen Dubnow wrote an essay entitled "A Vision of the Holy Tongue" in the melitsah style; the work concerned an allegorical figure, the Hebrew language, who attacks the obscurantists for their insistence on the exclusive study of the Talmud, neglect of the Bible, and hostility to the new Hebrew literature (ibid., pp. 44-45). Dubnow then read the lyrics of Micah Joseph Lebenson (Mikhal) and the bound volumes of the Hebrew journals that appeared in Russia beginning in the late fifties. When a synagogue hanger-on informed his grandfather that the young boy was an 'epiqorus, Dubnow wrote and distributed an ardent pamphlet against the men of darkness who fought the light of knowledge (ibid., pp. 55-56).</page><page sequence="4">286 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY able by the historian) provided the basic independence and self-sufficiency that enabled him to break away. Certainly Dubnow's revolt required con- siderable effort. There were inevitable conflicts with parents and a patri- archal grandfather who did not fully approve of his attempts to acquire a modern education because it led to his abandonment of halakhic observ- ance.6 In the end, however, father, mother, and grandfather always showed solicitude and even provided some material support during his Wander- jahre. (Dubnow's family by no means corresponded to the Haskalah stereo- type of hypocritical religious fanatics out to crush dissidence at any cost.)7 Furthermore, Dubnow retained some of the most important values of tra- ditional Judaism, albeit in a secular form. Although he broke with formal religious observance and did not internalize the watchful and command- ing God of Israel (the absence of this element from his psychic makeup may have been one of the most important effects of reading the Haskalah books), he never doubted the value of study to grasp the orderliness of 6. Dubnow's parents had five sons and five daughters (one son died in childhood). Two of them were unable to break away from the traditional milieu and establish successful new lives. His oldest brother became a talmudic scholar; after marrying he tried business without success and died at an early age in Moscow. One sister, whom he describes as full of lively and romantic inclinations, had an unhappy love affair which resulted in a still-born illegitimate child, and a later marriage ended in divorce (ibid., pp. 18-19, 84). His brother Wolf, a year and a half older than Simon, was his constant companion in youth. (In 1882 Wolf went to Palestine as a Biluist; although he returned to Russia three years later, Wolf remained enthusiastic about the Bilu ideal and influenced Simon in the direction of a nationalist conception of Jewish identity.) Being a middle child may have given Dubnow greater freedom to strike out on his own. He refused to continue studying in yeshivah after the age of thirteen, and his family did not press the issue (ibid., pp. 49-50). 7. Dubnow remembered his mother as a "typical Jewish woman of the old style" who continually worried about the family's debts for rent, clothes, food, and teachers, and supplemented her husband's income with earnings from a small china shop which did almost all its business just before the Passover season (ibid., p. 17). His father was in the lumber business of his rich but stingy father-in-law and lived at home only during the autumn. He portrays him as rather remote, sometimes irritable, often gloomy and preoccupied, but capable of tenderness. Because his horizons were not limited to the outskirts of Mstislavl, his son's ambitions for a broader education were not beyond his understanding (ibid., pp. 15-17, 41, 49, 105). Dubnow's grand- father was a pillar of Mstislavl's Jewish community. He had been a merchant, but retired around the age of forty to lecture on talmudic subjects in the main syna- gogue; as his reputation spread, he attracted students from throughout Belorussia. He despised Hasidism, avoided pilpul, and emphasized the plain meaning of the texts in the tradition of Rabbi Elijah bern Solomon Zalman, the famous "Vilna Gaon." On the grandfather, the most important figure of authority in Dubnow's childhood, see ibid., pp. 11-14, 49, and many other places in the first volume of the autobiography.</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT M.SELTZER 287 the universe." Dubnow's ideal of a life of study was an emulation of his grandfather, a talmudic scholar of great personal integrity. Also from this source he absorbed an extremely demanding ideal that the fruit of study must be carried over into action and one's life be wholeheartedly dedicated to the exemplification of principle.9 For these reasons, Dubnow's exodus from the shtetl was only partial: he broke with the family's way of life but never ran away. Since he re- mained closely attached to his family, nonconformity to their expectations had to be for the sake of an intellectually compelling motive; the Haskalah, therefore, offered Dubnow a self-image that assuaged any guilt that might ordinarily have been associated with rebellion. Using the Haskalah's severe dichotomy between the progressives and the obscurantists, Dubnow enrolled himself among the forces of truth who resisted superstition and backwardness.'0 The Haskalah, however, was not Dubnow's stopping place (as it had been for the previous generation), but a way station leading to new terrain. 8. The cosmos was always viewed by Dubnow as understandable, though he claims as a child to have had glimpses of the abyss of its impersonal coldness (ibid., pp. 27-28). 9. In 1890, shortly after his grandfather's death, Dubnow was working on his first Hebrew essay since childhood: "I inscribed my brochure on the first page, 'To the memory of him who all the days of his life did not depart from the tent of the Torah.' I felt that I was obligated to this hero of the spirit, who had given me an inheritance and an affection for the tent of Torah, although it was a completely different, broader, and free Torah" (ibid., p. 270). 10. Through the Haskalah the nonconformist became an established social type within the still predominantly traditional East European Jewish world. Many locali- ties in the 1860s already had what amounted to an informal society of maskilim. The traditionalists' suspicion of the maskilim was exacerbated by the tendency of the latter to look to the Russian government for support to enforce their program, so that the "Berlinchiks" appeared at times to represent not the interests of the Jews as a whole, but the narrower interests of the class of modernized intellectuals and wealthy merchants (Patterson, Hebrew Novel, p. 158; Elias Tcherikower, Yehudim be-'iftot mahpekhah [Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1957], p. 123). Although Dubnow de- scribed his conversion to Haskalah solely as the result of the books he read and his natural inclination to rebel against casuistry and the supposed terrors associated with the Other World, there were several people in Mstislavl who undoubtedly exercised a strong influence on him. A family living on the outskirts of town possessed a secret library of Haskalah literature from which he was able to borrow. Also, a group of friends, who had begun a small collection of Russian books, provided strong moral and emotional support for his later sallies into secular education. Thus, Dubnow's autobiographical account of a highly individualistic child holding aloft the banner of reason against the united forces of obscurantism is not entirely accurate. (KZ, I, 27-28, 35-38, 51-53, 61.)</page><page sequence="6">288 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY Among the most important Jewish culture heroes that Dubnow acquired in his late teens were Karl Ludwig Bdrne, Moses Mendelssohn, and especially the young Moshe Leib Lilienblum, whose autobiographical novel, Hjat'ot Ne'urim, ended by demolishing the authority of the Haskalah itself, char- acterized as yet another form of "drunken fantasy" which led to nothing practical and realistic.11 Thus, the late positivistic Haskalah sent Dubnow by the age of twenty to the sacred texts of Russian youth aspiring to be- come "critically thinking men." The world view of contemporary Russian positivism that Dubnow took over from the writings of Nicholas Cherny- shevsky and Dmitry Pisarev was, he thought, the distillation of contem- porary European civilization: an amalgam drawn from Auguste Comte, Ludwig Biichner, Jacob Moleschott, Henry Thomas Buckle, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, and others. (Dubnow was never drawn to Russian political radicalism but only to its conception of science, ethics, and his- tory.) Each element of the new world view further justified his rejection of the past. Materialism viewed with disdain all apriori reasoning, es- pecially concerning a spiritual realm of being and a supernatural origin of nature. (As Thomas Masaryk remarked, "In Russia, as elsewhere, mate- rialism was an ultra-radical negation of the theocentric view of the universe and life.")12 Utilitarianism provided an ethical system which avoided any 11. Ibid., pp. 67-68. Lilienblum's novel was first published in Vienna in 1876 and was unique among semiautobiographical works in nineteenth-century Hebrew literature for its excellent psychological analysis. In Lilienblum's book the "sins of youth" are really the sins against youth, for the enlightenment has given the narrator no purpose in life; Dubnow remarked that it seemed at the time that the book clearly pointed the way to a new generation of Jews totally indifferent to Judaism (ibid., pp. 77-79). After reading Bbrne's Letters from Paris in Russian translation, Dubnow was im- pudent enough to quote him in a final examination. When his politically conservative teacher read the statement-"the noble man may be the slave of circumstances, but he who becomes the lackey of circumstances is an ignoble man"-Dubnow was sus- pected of revolutionary leanings and graded down accordingly (ibid., p. 70). At the time when the young Moses Mendelssohn was his hero, Dubnow read Georges Bernard Depping's History of the Jews in the Middle Ages and toyed with the notion of going to the Breslau Theological Seminary in order to become a rabbinical re- former (ibid., pp. 79-81). 12.

The Russian radicals' materialism was largely drawn from the German popularizers of science, such as Ludwig Biichner. Biichner, in his widely read Kraft und Stofi, which went through nine editions beginning with 1855, presents a monist conception of reality which rejects the separate existences of spirit and matter, and insists that mind is but an epiphenomenon of the human body.

Rooting the good in the maximiza- tion of happiness, utilitarianism supported the unceasing struggle of the individual for self-perfection, justified resistance to the tyranny of the ma- jority, and reinforced altruistic commitment to social progress.'" Mate- rialistic atheism and utilitarian morality were merged by means of a scheme Albert Lange, The History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance (New York: Humanities Press, 1950), pp. 262-84; John Theodore Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century, 4 vols. (New York: Dover, 1965), II, 322-23, and Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969), III, 120-21. From this aspect of Russian radicalism Dubnow acquired a lifelong antipathy to metaphysics; he considered German idealist philisophy to be "fuzzy thinking" and could not accept the notion that speculative reason gives knowl- edge of being, independent of the findings of the sciences. From positivism he also acquired a passion for exactitude and the systematic organization of facts--together with an impatience with epistemological questions characteristic as well of the writ- ings of the Russian critics. Dmitry Pisarev, for example, insisted that "manifestness is the best guarantee of reality" and that the "impossibility of manifestation excludes any reality of existence" (Dmitry Pisarev, Selected Philosophical, Social, and Political Essays [Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1958], p. 104). 13. The principle of utility rests on the assumption that man's only object is to seek pleasure and shun pain, and that terms such as just and unjust, moral and immoral, good and bad, can be resolved into pain and pleasure, without recourse to metaphysics. From this is derived the principle that actions are right as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse. Jeremy Bentham re- jected the concept of natural rights, but was able to bring his system into harmony with democratic radicalism through the famous phrase "the greatest good for the greatest number," which was interpreted as "everybody is to count for one, nobody for more than one." (See Jeremy Bentham, "Principles of Legislation," in Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in the West [New York: Columbia University Press, 1954], II, 313-15; John Stuart Mill, Selected Writings, ed. Maurice Cowling [New York: New American Library, 1968], p. 249; Warner Fite, An Introductory Study of Ethics [New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1903], p. 88.) The personal implica- tions of utilitarianism ultimately depend on what constitutes pleasure for the utili- tarian; the Russian radicals disavowed "frivolous pleasure" and hedonism, and con- sidered most fine literature and art useless except as propaganda. Thus, utilitarianism was interpreted by them to buttress their concern for social betterment. (On Ben- tham's influence in Russia and on Mill's interpretation of duty in the category of pleasure, see Gertrude Himmelfarb, Victorian Minds [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1968], pp. 286-87.) For Dubnow, who was not drawn into the social struggle, the purpose of life was the acquisition of scientific knowledge and self-perfection. John Stuart Mill's "gospel of individualism" became his "model of clear, honest thinking." He decided that he had been sacrificed by his parents to the despotism of public opinion and thus unjustly deprived of the general education he wanted (KZ, I, 100-102).</page><page sequence="8">290 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY of history which taught that the progressive achievements of science would inevitably result in the emancipation of the human race.'4 Armed with these convictions, Dubnow set out to master universal knowledge and become a full member of the cosmopolitan brotherhood that would liberate mankind from its intellectual fetters. (In his auto- biography he points out the similarity between this undertaking and his grandfather's devotion to talmudic study.)'5 Dubnow's youthful idealism was further reinforced by the Russian radicals' printsipial'nost': the in- sistence that the intellectual's private life must be an expression of his principles regardless of emotion and convenience.'6 As Dubnow remarked in explaining his most deliberately iconoclastic behavior at the time: if people did not accept the practical consequences of their ideas, "the world would be full of lies, false religiosity, feigned convictions, and the great meaning of life-the sincere search for truth-would be lost." ' Reject- ing a religious marriage, he and his fiancee lived together without any legal formality in St. Petersburg, where he was beginning his career as a writer for Voskhod, the most important Russian Jewish journal. Only when he moved back to Mstislavl in the mid-eighties (after the government refused him permission to reside permanently in the capital), did he reluctantly agree to a private Jewish wedding ceremony.'" He persistently refused to 14. At this stage, Dubnow's view of history was drawn from Comte, Henry Thomas Buckle's History of the Civilization in England (1857-61), and John Draper's History of the Intellectual Development of Europe (first published in 1862). James Billington discusses the great influence of Comte in Russia ("The In- telligentsia and the Religion of Humanity," American Historical Review, LXV [July 1960], 807-21). While the Russian materialists dethroned the mind as an inde- pendent force, they thoroughly believed in the ability of critical thinking to shape the future. In the first half of his twenties Dubnow was very sympathetic to the Comtean conception of history, with its sharp distinctions between periods of de- velopment and its emphasis on the development of man's intellectual life from the theological to the metaphysical to the positive stages. Later, Dubnow moved closer to Herbert Spencer's more gradualist view of progress. (On Dubnow's early attitude to Buckle, Draper, Comte, Spencer, and Karl Marx: KZ, I, 107-8.) 15. Ibid., pp. 175-76. 16. Abram Tertz defines printsipial'nost' as "a mental habit of referring every matter, however small, concrete or trivial, to lofty and abstract principles" (Abram Tertz [pseud.], On Socialist Realism, trans. George Dennis [New York: Pantheon Books, 1960], p. 31). 17. KZ, I, 176. 18. Dubnow explained: "For that era this was a very daring step, not only with respect to our relatives in the provinces, but to our social circle in Petersburg; yet it was no obstacle to me since it was a matter of being true to my convictions" (ibid., p. 152).</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT M. SELTZER 291 conform in any other way to traditional religious practice. Despite his grandfather's polite pressure, Dubnow would not attend the synagogue on Yom Kippur, since this would mean pretending to converse with a deity whose existence he did not acknowledge.'9 It would have been "painful and distressing" to be present at his son's berit milah (he was absent from Mstislavl at the time), and it was with the greatest difficulty that he forced himself to recite the Kaddish at his father's funeral.20 Positivism was thus a psychological wall which defended his hard-won individualization against the danger that he might capitulate merely out of pity for his family's feelings. Nevertheless, in his mid and later twenties Dubnow underwent a crisis of belief and self-definition, which proved to be the turning point of his life and the beginning of a new period of inner growth. Symptoms of his depression were incapacitating headaches, bouts of loneliness, pessi- mistic thoughts about the prevalence of suffering in the universe, and increasing perplexity about his vocation as a writer. The headaches forced a hiatus in his efforts to master universal knowledge.2' Enforced idleness permitted him to bring to the surface the possibility that positivism was emotionally stifling and intellectually inadequate. It first occurred to him that positivism did not answer the longings of his heart, expressed in the love of lyric poetry and the "healing force" of the landscape.22 At the age of twenty-five he confessed in his diary: 19. Ibid., p. 176. 20. On his absence from his son's circumcision: ibid., p. 220. He did not go to the synagogue during the year of mourning for his father to read the traditional prayers about God's will because "I myself did not know whose will created the world where a poor wanderer could not rest in his rebuilt family nest during his declining years" (ibid., p. 213). 21. Ibid., pp. 180, 192. He overcame his eye troubles in 1890 when he was given special lenses to correct his astigmatism (ibid., p. 237), but some of the physical pain of those years was certainly a result of mental crisis. His suffering may also have given him a greater sense of the physical limitations of concrete reality. 22. In the summer of 1884 he decided that he had made "too severe demands" on literature by insisting that it be concerned only with "world problems and Welt- schmerz." When he burst into tears while reading Turgenev he concluded that "you cannot divide the sphere of Reason so sharply from that of Emotion. A true artistic production without a definite ideological foundation, as well as a good philosophical treatise, can be a source for deep thought" (ibid., p. 172). The joint portraits of Mill and Shelley stood on his writing desk for a number of years (ibid., p. 170). Although he regarded the theater, opera, and painting with indifference, he had a lifelong fondness for lyric poetry, especially that of Heine, Byron, Shelley, Pushkin, Ler- montov, and, above all, Victor Hugo (ibid., pp. 171, 178). On his love of nature and the freshness of the countryside as against the city: ibid., pp. 105, 198, 205, 215.</page><page sequence="10">292 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY The nature of my present skepticism is not completely clear. Its gen- eral basis was purely emotional. Its characteristics are the following: hunger for faith not completely satisfied by the positivistic religion of humanity; thoughts on the unattainability of the most important se- crets of existence which disturb the mind despite the prohibitions of positivism; doubts about the moral progress of man.23 Dubnow's doubt about man's moral condition reflects a growing aware- ness that simplistic, uniformitarian optimism about the inevitability of progress was not appropriate in the conditions of the late 1880s. Not only was the general political situation in Russia gloomy, but in Russia and even in Western Europe antisemitism was increasing in strength. Until then Dubnow had maintained in his reviews and articles that the pogroms of 1881-82 were only a passing aberration. The Russian government would soon realize that it must emancipate the Jews. Russian Jewry could best prepare for citizenship by undertaking a program of thorough religious and cultural reform, including the extirpation (with the government's help) of Hasidic and other superstitions.24 Dubnow did not consider the current upsurge of Jew-hatred either a major social force or an intellectual prob- lem. While making a reputation as one of the brashest young Jewish critics writing in Russian, he privately considered his articles on Jewish themes only a temporary endeavor until he would be able to write on more general subjects. But when his ideology began to disintegrate, his eyes were open to the painful social realities affecting the Jews at home and abroad. As a result he began to experience the full force of his personal isolation among both Jews and Russians. He discovered that he was speaking to no significant group of Jews, and that there was no place for 23. Ibid., p. 192. Soon after, he made some notes on Job and Ecclesiastes, and derived the following scheme, which he called the "psychological and ethical basis of pessimism": first, there was "the yearning inherent in each man for the infinite, which is unobtainable in view of his finite nature"; then, a war existed between man's "feeling and mind" and in the struggle for existence "often not the moral but the physically stronger wins"; finally, in place of the utilitarian concept of the greatest happiness, he concluded that one should substitute the principle that an increase in happiness is simply the result of a decrease in suffering. "In those days I reviewed my whole world view and stood in horror before the abyss of life" (ibid., p. 194). 24. The most important articles of his early stage are: # 1, "Several Stages in the History of Jewish Thought," Russkii Evrei, 1881; # 16, "What Kind of Self-Emanci- pation Do the Jews Need?," Voskhod, 1883; #23, "Palestinophilism and Its Main Advocate (Smolenski) [sic]," Voskhod, 1883; #31, "A Last Word on the Condemned Jewry," Voskhod, 1884; #39, "On the Reform of the Jewish School," Voskhod, 1885.

He became increasingly op- pressed by the anti-Jewish regulations that prevented him from settling in the capital.25 The Russian intellectuals that he chanced to meet expressed no sympathy for the Jews as a whole nor friendship for an enlightened, free- thinking Jew dedicated to advanced universal ideals.26 In a book review of 1888 Dubnow remarked that a young Jewish boy who left his yeshivah in order to search for truth in the university now finds only 'disillusion there and "with pain in his heart" comes home.27 Dubnow needed a social role that would enable him to express his beliefs and participate in the struggle to actualize them. Printsipial'nost' ruled out a career as a professional journalist: he needed to be the mission- ary of a great cause. The eventual resolution of Dubnow's ideological and vocational crisis is summarized in the following autobiographical passage, based on his diary of 1887: The twenty-seventh year of my life was a decisive moment. Until then my thoughts still ran to general literary plans, although actually I worked only in Jewish literature. I was unhappy with this narrow sphere of activity and longed for the broader problems which my mentors Mill, Spencer, Renan, and Taine studied. My eye illness, in- volving the danger of losing normal sight, gave me the impulse for 25.

Late in 1886, after a two-month wait in the capital to achieve bona fide legal residence there, his request was again denied and he was ordered to leave the city within twenty-four hours. He went to the nearby village of Tsarskoe Selo, greatly perturbed. The snowdrifts among which he walked were "a symbol of frozen Russia, a lifeless country crushed under the Tsarist regime," and "the sign of Cain, 'Jew,' follows me everywhere" (ibid., p. 202). In 1890 he made a final effort, writing a petition "asking them to give me through graciousness that which a dog is given without applying" (ibid., p. 242). Even though his editor asked Baron Horace Giinzberg to recommend Dubnow personally, this appeal was decisively turned down (ibid., p. 243). 26. Dubnow had almost no contact with the Russian intelligentsia in St. Peters- burg; his acquaintances there were relatives, Jewish journalists, and a few russified Jewish writers, such as Grigori Bogrov, Akim Flekser-Volinsky, and his closest friend at the time, the poet Simon Frug. The only non-Jewish writer Dubnow knew personally was Nikolay Leskov. Leskov used Jewish themes sympathetically in a num- ber of his stories and wrote a widely cited defense of equal rights for Russian Jews, but Dubnow found some of his attitudes and private actions repulsive (see ibid., pp. 150-52). He gradually concluded that the Russian intelligentsia of his time was, as a whole, indifferent to, if not actually infected with, antisemitism. (See for example #10, p. 740; #31, p. 3; #78, p. 40; #60, p. 12; # 90 [February], p. 19.) 27. #90, p. 25.</page><page sequence="12">294 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY deeper thought. I became convinced that true creativity required the process of self-limitation---that qabbalistic secret of concentration (sod ha-tsimtsum) that the Infinite used to create the world from pri- mordial chaos. I now understood that my path to the universal lay expressly through the field of the national in which I was already working. One could serve humanity only by serving one of its parts, all the more so a nation of the most ancient culture. It became clear that my general knowledge and universal ambitions would give fruitful results in conjunction with the inherited treasures of Jewish knowl- edge and the yet unformed Jewish national ideals. From this time began my propensity for the great themes of Jewish history.28 For the sake of further self-integration Dubnow had given up some of the rigid defenses provided by positivism, and found he could accept Jewish- ness without thwarting his independence and integrity. He was now able to make peace with his childhood world through a vocational ideal which provided a relationship to Judaism that did not contravene a firm rejection of the literal truth of religion. (His ideal in this regard was the French historian of religion, Ernest Renan.)29 In 1890 Dubnow moved to Odessa, where he quickly became a recognized part of the illustrious group of Jewish intellectuals there. From the vantage point of one of Russia's most cosmopolitan cities and Jewry's most modern communities, not only did he overcome the social and intellectual isolation of his previous period, but he was able to view traditional East European Jewry with greater equanimity and to perceive its special strength.30 In Dubnow's historical writings of the early nineties, he presented a solu- tion to the dilemma of the modern Jew, which he called "historism." 31 28. KZ, I, 206-207. 29. In 1888, several years after his anti-positivist mood had first seized him, he told the father superior of the Mstislavl monastery, who had visited him to attempt his conversion, that "I relate to all religions as an investigator and not as a partici- pant" (ibid., pp. 221-22). I hope to treat Dubnow's indebtedness to Ernest Renan in detail in a separate article. On Dubnow's attitude toward Renan, see ibid., p. 221 and #123 (April), p. 31. 30. Dubnow's closest associates in Odessa were Sholem Aleikhem, Mendele Mokher Seforim, Ahad Ha-Am, the journalist Mark Rabinovich (Ben Ami) and the lawyer and civic leader Michael Margulis; other acquaintances there were future Zionist leaders and outstanding literary figures, such as Yehoshua Ravnitsky, Micah Berdichevsky, Hayyim Bialik, Sh. Ben Zion, Hayyim Tchernowitz, and Meir Dizengof. 31. Dubnow's "historism" is to be distinguished from the "historicism" that has been detected among nineteenth-century German scholars; Dubnow strongly rejected ethical relativism, whereas it has been pointed out that "historicism ... came to be confronted by ethical nihilism as the logical consequence of its position that all</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT M. SELTZER 295 Although he frequently uses the life cycle of the individual as a metaphor of the group, the underlying process must have been the reverse: Dubnow's personal experience in achieving integratsiia dushi through accepting the past has become the model for Jewish self-consciousness. A fundamental assumption of "historism" is that the goal of personal development is the realization that one's tastes, convictions, and character result from the im- print of past experience, reworked by thought, and crystallized into a definite form. Therefore, "a conscious relationship to the past is the cri- terion of spiritual development." 32 Through formulating the "psychologi- cal laws of his own being," the mature man has attained self-understand- ing and a rich inner life. Obedience to the Delphic maxim "Know your- self" is Dubnow's advice to the Jewish people: the essence of the Jewish national ideal is historical consciousness.33 Armed with the laws of Jew- ish historical development, the Jewish masses will be equipped to with- stand the blows of fate, the sagging morale of the secular intelligentsia will revive, the national feeling of those who require a rational justification for remaining Jewish will be strengthened.34 Jewish history enables the people to overcome the limitations imposed by powerlessness and social isolation by demonstrating that the spiritual triumphs in the long run over the physical. Borrowing heavily from Heinrich Graetz, Dubnow portrayed values and cognitions are bound in their validity to the historical situation in which they arise" (Georg G. Iggers, The German Conception of History [Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1968], p. 270). 32. #98, p. 1. This discussion introduces his influential article calling for the es- tablishment of a Russian Jewish historical society. The essay is prefaced with a motto from Cicero: "Not to know history means always to be a child" (ibid.). Dubnow explains that the child knows the present through direct sensations and lives primarily for immediate joys; his sense of the future consists of promised rewards and feared punishments, while his past is composed of fragmented memories not logically or causally related to his present. When the growing person learns to antici- pate consequences, he acquires the faculty of foresight. But the practical man, who concerns himself exclusively with the present and future and is preoccupied with achieving expedient results, remains incomplete. Full maturity requires "a conscious relationship to the past." 33. Ibid., pp. 5-6. Dubnow insists that religion does not account for Jewish co- hesion, since in the forefront of the Jewish national movement stand freethinkers indifferent to religion; unconscious racial characteristics also explain nothing because typical Jewish mannerisms disappear in the upper classes without necessarily weak- ening their ties to the people (ibid., p. 6). See also # 111 (October-November), pp. 120-21, where he explains that the conscious and unconscious elements of "the Jewish national soul" have been produced over the course of centuries as a result of the "magnetic power" of similar historical fortunes. 34. # 111 (October), p. 121; #98, pp. 4-5.</page><page sequence="14">296 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY the Jewish people, especially in its diaspora phase, as "thinker, stoic, and sufferer," eking out existence under conditions with which no other nation had coped or could ever do so.35 Dubnow did not give up his positivistic rejection of philosophical idealism: the spiritual principle was not inherent in the universe as a whole, but in the ideas, memories, sense of mission, and, above all, freedom of will which enabled the Jews to withstand ad- versity for so many centuries and remain faithful to their goals even to martyrdom. To illustrate this lesson, a historical synopsis making up the core of his well-known essay "What Is Jewish History?" is a virtual biogra- phy of the people. As a child the Jewish nation must be dragged along by his elders, but eventually he learns to march ahead, armed against his ene- mies with spiritual weapons only. Though he may reel under the impact of persecutions and pogroms, when conditions permit he rises to his full stature and attains the pinnacle of intellectual achievement.36 Thus, in his own way, Dubnow expressed the notions of collective will and collective consciousness so noticeable in many forms of European thought during the nineties. In "historism" Dubnow not only had created a personal substitute for the positivist religion of science, he also found a surrogate for traditional religion. History and the cult of nature closely complemented each other: lyric poetry was for him the singing of psalms directed toward the cosmic whole of which one was a part; history offered personal transcendence in contemplating the march of the people through time."' Recalling the in- fluence of Renan in his writings of this period, Dubnow remarked: I reasoned thus: I am an agnostic in religion and philosophy to the extent to which they solve the riddles of the world, but I can know 35. #111 (October), p. 120. 36. "What Is Jewish History?" (#111) appeared in the October-November and the December 1893 issues of Voskhod. In his diary Dubnow described the fifty-page "philosophical-historical synthesis" as his "historical credo in miniature." Later he reappraised it as "a hymn to Jewish history" (KZ, I, 274-75). An English translation was published by the Jewish Publication Society in 1903, reprinted in Koppel S. Pinson, ed., Nationalism and History: Essays on Old and New Judaism by Simon Dubnow (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1958), pp. 253-324. 37. Ibid., pp. 344-45. One summer evening in 1898, sitting on a bench in a coun- try garden overlooking the Dnieper, Dubnow felt that he had a "single vision beyond all human understanding. . . . From then on I was strongly moved by a cult of nature, a kind of pantheism which I called emotional. Thus I found peace between two opposing principles: burning historism and cold cosmism. The unconsciously religious [feeling] which the contemplation of nature gives us, together with the conscious, scholarly element, were the basis of my harmonious world view" (ibid.).</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT M. SELTZER 297 how mankind lived in the course of the millennia and by means of what paths it searched out truth and justice. Although I have lost faith in personal immortality, history teaches me that there is collec- tive immortality.3s Among the literary influences that can be detected in Dubnow's his- torism are the Russian populist Peter Lavrov and the French poet Victor Hugo.39 Perhaps even more important was Leo Tolstoy of the Confession. Dubnow felt a close affinity to this man, who also had rejected formal reli- gion and had dedicated himself to self-perfection but who, shaken by the awareness of death, forged a bond between the finite and the infinite based on the individual's life process as expressed in all of humanity."4 In Dub- now's case this quasi-pantheistic vision enabled him to bring the particular, Jewishness, into the center of his selfhood. The final stage of what came to be called Dubnovism appeared in his essays on contemporary issues published between 1897 and 1907, many of which were included in his Letters on Old and New Judaism.41 These articles were written in the turbulent decade that saw the formation of the Zionist movement, the Bund, the Poalei Zion, and a number of more ephemeral Jewish parties-a period of political ferment that impelled Dub- now to crystallize his views in the form of an ideology uniting theory and practice, which used a more sociological, less spiritual approach to Jewish identity. National autonomy was, of course, his political formula to ensure the future survival of the Jewish people: that the Jews be legally guaran- teed their own cultural, communal, and educational institutions, that the 38. Ibid., p. 221. 39. I hope to deal with the influence of Lavrov and Hugo on Dubnow in a separate article. Lavrov and other populist theoreticians emphasized that the study of human consciousness required an introspective method and therefore materialism was inapplicable to the domain of history. In Hugo's poetry Dubnow apparently found a reverence for cosmic infinity, together with a faith in liberty and progress, close to his own view (ibid., p. 245; KZ, III, 147). 40. Ibid., pp. 160-61. Dubnow insisted that Tolstoy's thought had a Jewish char- acter because it postulated the triumph of the moral over the merely aesthetic ("Yesod ha-Yahadut she-betorat Tolstoy," Ha-Shiloah [1911], pp. 627-28). 41. Dubnow began writing his series of Letters on Old and New Judaism at the end of 1897. During the summer of 1906 and the spring of 1907 they were in part rewritten and arranged in an orderly sequence for publication. The book is divided into three parts: "General Principles," "Between Social Tendencies," and "Between Inquisition and Emancipation, 1903-1907." Included also is published material not originally labeled "Letters," some of which appears in appendices.

The process of Dubnow's personal integration came to a climax in the concept of autonomy. In the Letters Dubnow avers that every individualized organism (he refers to the nation, but it applies as well to the person) must develop ac- cording to its own law, evolving the pattern discovered in its formative period.43 For the individual to mold itself according to a pattern brought 42. Dubnow's ideology became the platform of the Folkspartei, allied with the left-wing Kadets. The Folkspartei was founded in 1907, and remained a small group in St. Petersburg without agents, funds, or initiative to recruit in the prov- inces; it was revived briefly in 1917 and reappeared with more success in Poland, especially between 1916 and 1926 (see #170). The party platform demanded that Russia be a multinational state with a democratic constitution recognizing national rights as well as civil freedom. National rights were defined as the freedom of the individual to identify himself as a member of his true nationality. According to the platform, territorial minorities should receive regional autonomy, while nonterritorial minorities, "which are scattered over various provinces without being a majority in any, will have communal and cultural autonomy" (Pis'ma, p. 83). The Jews were, of course, the main instance of a non-territorial nationality. The Folkspartei pro- gram envisioned establishing a general Jewish va'ad or council, which would select a permanent executive to supervise Jewish life in Russia, support national Jewish culture, attempt to improve Jewish economic conditions, and exert influence on the Russian administration and parliament in all matters of Jewish interest. Hayyim Zhitlovsky and Nathan Birnbaum advocated similar programs of Jewish minority rights. The Austrian Social Democratic Party also developed an influential concept of "personal" nationalism, but its main spokesmen did not consider the Jews a legiti- mate nationality. By 1907 every modern Jewish party, including the Bund, Zionism, and even anti-Zionism, had accepted this principle in some form. (See Oscar Jan- owsky, The Jews and Minority Rights [1898-1919], [New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, 1933] and Henry Tobias, "The Jews in Tsarist Russia: The Political Education of a Minority," Minorities and Politics, ed. Henry J. Tobias and Charles E. Woodhouse IAlbuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1969], pp. 19-38.) 43. Pis'ma, pp. 81, 160 (footnote), 258-59. Dubnow's concept of national unfolding bears a superficial resemblance to Hegelianism, but it is actually a form of social Darwinism. Dubnow considered the basic social unit (the nation) a primordial entity, whereas the state was an artificial creation at a certain stage of history and not absolutely necessary for the survival of the nation. The biological metaphor was irresistible: according to Dubnow a nation wages a perpetual struggle to survive in the face of other national organisms that seek to dispossess or destroy it, and a nation acquires definite characteristics as it is gradually shaped by the social en- vironment. Dubnow's nationalism rests on an impersonal Plan vital, perhaps akin to the ultimate force which Dubnow sensed in his pantheistic moments-a vast natural power before which the individual is dwarfed and yet which he feels pulsating within</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT M. SELTZER 299 forth by another (heteronomy) was unnatural, unhealthy, and humiliating, whereas loyalty to one's true nationality was affirming the self. More- over, betrayal of heredity and heritage represented, in the case of the Jew, a cowardly flight from a beleaguered people. Identification with the nation was not a capitulation to social pressure, but a voluntary act of will which avoided the psychological cost of imitating an alien cultural style.44 Dub- now insisted that the impossibility of assimilation had been conclusively demonstrated by the rise of racial antisemitism, in which the host nation instinctively despises a Jew who tries to gain acceptance through putting on a foreign mask.45 According to Dubnow, assimilationist ideologies appeared in modern Jewry as a result of a fundamental error of the Haskalah and, by implica- tion, of the European enlightment as a whole. The enlightenment taught the Jew to criticize the parochialism in his tradition, but it misled him into thinking that he could turn himself into a cosmopolitan. There are universal ideas, but no cosmopolitan man. A Jew who considers himself such has in effect fused with the nation-state which condescended to grant him citizen- ship, or which he hopes will confer it on him.46 Unfortunately, the version of emancipation promoted by the enlightenment stripped the Jewish people of its traditional social defenses-defenses which insured Jewish self- respect and the continuity of generations- and left the individual Jew naked and bewildered in an inhospitable world. Not atomistic citizenship in an assimilationist nation-state but legal autonomy in a culturally plural- istic, multinational state would provide the Jewish people with a recognized place in a world of nations and, at the same time, facilitate full Jewish participation in modern civilization.'7 himself. Although Dubnow's nationalism is analogous to kinship, the basis of the nation's will-to-live was psychic, not physical. "The nation's consciousness is the main criterion of its existence. 'I think of myself as a nation-therefore I am'" (ibid., p. 26). 44. See, for example, ibid., pp. 31, 47, 117-18, 123-25, 258-9. 45. Ibid., pp. 51, 79. The expression "putting on their masks" is found on p. 241. 46. "The antithesis [the enlightenment] humanized us, but at the same time de- nationalized us" (ibid., p. 80). For his criticisms of cosmopolitanism see, for ex- ample, ibid., pp. 25, 45, 67, 275. 47. Although Dubnow insisted on the validity of the nineteenth-century aspiration for freedom of religious and philosophical thought among the Jewish people, he viewed the enlightenment-when pushed to its ultimate conclusion-as national suicide (ibid., p. 79). The "New Judaism" would preserve the best of the "thesis" (the medieval communal pattern) without its oligarchy, isolation, and intellectual fetters; it would acknowledge the necessary and important achievements of the</page><page sequence="18">300 SIMON DUBNOW'S IDEOLOGY Like Dubnow's earlier beliefs, autonomism entailed a system of psychic defenses: not defenses against the fear of relapsing into the family's tradi- tionalist expectations, but safeguards against outer rebuff-a protecting wall to ensure self-fulfillment. Having accepted one's social location and shouldered part of the nation's burden, one is at liberty to partake in the universal.48 Autonomism, therefore, tied together a number of loose strands in Dubnow's life. It was a continuation of his youthful loyalty to Haskalah, with necessary revisions as a result of a more concrete appraisal of the social nature of man. Like positivism it was seemingly scientific, but incorporated the heart and the particular-the warmth of returning home where one belonged. Autonomism was Dubnow's historism projected forward to insure immortality through the collective, and outward to con- front the rest of the world in dignity. Autonomism enabled him to remain, in the violence-prone mass society of the twentieth century, faithful to the gradualist, rational, humanitarian liberalism of the nineteenth. It can hardly be said that Dubnow fully solved the problem of being at the same time Jewish and modern.49 One of the most important weaknesses in his approach lies in his conception of the relation of religion to ethnicity in Jewish history. (Indeed, he almost asserts that the universal element in Jewish identity is ethnicity, while the particular is religious-a monu- mental reversal of the Jewish tradition, although admittedly one which has permitted many Jews with a modern secular orientation to maintain their Jewish identity.) However, his stance was very successful on psychological grounds. It enabled him to husband the inner strength and persistence of "antithesis" (the Haskalah and related movements) without the latter's self-destruc- tiveness. Having affirmed that the Jewish nation required the right to the means that would insure its survival, Dubnow concluded: "Here I found and crossed the bridge from Mill's doctrine of the absolute freedom of the individual to the doctrine of the freedom of the collective" (KZ, I, 329-30). 48. See such expressions as "defensive wall" and "mailed soul" (Pis'ma, p. 47), the "fulcrum" must be within (ibid., p. 52), voluntary "isolation" (ibid., p. 108). An emancipation that acknowledges explicitly the existence of the Jewish nation will not be a "gift of kindness" but an act of justice to an ancient cultured personality which "has resided nineteen centuries in Europe" (ibid., pp. 44, 238). 49. For the extended dispute among East European Jewish ideologists between spiritual nationalism and spiritual Zionism on the one hand, and political Zionism on the other, see Sh. Brayman, Ha-pulmos ben Lilienblum le-ven 'Ahzad Ha-Am ve- Dubnov ve-ha-reqa' shello (Jerusalem: Sifriat ha-makhon le-madrikhim, 1951).

Mem- orable are the chapters in Dubnow's autobiography which show him dog- gedly enduring the deprivations and sufferings of the Russian revolution and civil war while continuing to integrate the soul of his people in the Weltgeschichte des Jiidischen Volkes. Specific issues aside, the post- enlightenment dialectic resulting in personal autonomy through the demand for national autonomy is paradigmatic of the shaping of the East European Jewish nationalist intelligentsia and that of many other peoples entering the continuous age of transition which is modernity.5? 50.
