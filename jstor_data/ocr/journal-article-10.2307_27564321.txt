Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005. x, 251 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000827 Delving into the past, both in oral and literary form, has long been presented by Jewish tradition as a religious imperative. "Remember days long gone by," Deuteronomy 32:7 instructs. "Ponder the years of each generation, ask your father and let him tell you, and your grandfather, who will explain it." The syn thesis between Jewish memory and ritual is most apparent in the historical narra tives that pervade the Sabbath and the Jewish calendar. Yet writing about the Jewish past that is founded on historical consciousness and is independent of direct theological motives, as Yosef Hayyim Yerushalmi has argued most 3.

Malchow, Gothic Images of Race in Nineteenth Century Britain (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1996). 427</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews prominently, is a relatively recent phenomenon that began with the early modem Jewish encounter with European intellectualism. Nils Roemer, a disciple of Yerushalmi, has produced an emdite work that traces the evolving role played by this fresh Wissenschaft des Judentums within nineteenth-century German Jewish life. His central argument, contrasted most directly with Gershom Scholem's view, is that it is mistaken to equate the introduc tion of secular tools of the trade with secularization or assimilation. Although the critical study of Jewish history was certainly at the foundation of efforts to reform long-held practices and beliefs, for the most part, it did not serve to alienate German Jews from their religious identity. On the contrary, it more likely was drafted as a response to antisemitic charges that could both defend Judaism's image within the public sphere and strengthen Jewish self-confidence, which had been shaken by the biting attacks of leading German ideologues. Moreover, toward the end of the century, it became a vehicle for the popularization of the Jewish past and a reengagement of German Jews with their religion. In the author's words, "Whereas historical studies had started out at the beginning of the nineteenth century as a critical tool to evaluate the Jewish heritage, they evolved into a supplementary field in Jewish education for religious learning" (126). Roemer's celebration of the popularization of the study of Jewish history challenges, among others, prior perceptions of German Jewish historiography that focus on its elitist nature. Ironically, it would appear that in the process, he actually buttresses one of the central critiques by the late Amos Funkenstein ("Col lective Memory and Historical Consciousness") of his own mentor's strict distinc tion between Jewish memory and Jewish history. Though the instruments for retelling the past had changed dramatically, the main function of Jewish historical study?at least through the nineteenth century?remained that of a narrative foun dation for various efforts at sustaining Jewish vitality. Medieval midrash and folk lore made way for scientific criticism, but the latter continued to produce a religiously usable memory. The original perspective of the book?by no means its only usable element? is stated already in the introduction but emerges mainly in the last three chapters. There, Roemer highlights the dramatic increase in the late nine teenth century of Jewish book clubs, communal-and B'nai Brith-sponsored libraries, and lay historical associations. Such popular forums, with their extensive Judaica collections, reading rooms, and public lecture series, sprouted up in both large and mid-sized Jewish communities throughout Germany. They are testi mony, according to the author, to the use of Jewish scholarship as a vehicle for strengthening Jewish identity. As these frameworks are so crucial to Roemer's central argument, I would have liked to see more statistics to illustrate their actual proliferation. Regarding the 1860s, the author admits openly, "There is no way to establish the number and size of these Jewish reading associations and borrowing libraries" (73). The later chapters produce more solid evidence of notable increases in organizational membership and attendance at events, yet this is also the period of massive urbanization of German Jewry, as well as the great influx of eastern European Jews. A comparison, therefore, between these data and membership in other voluntary Jewish frameworks, such as 428</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews synagogues and sports clubs, would have been instructive in evaluating the signifi cance of the data. The chronological structure of the book enables the author to avoid many of the pitfalls of more concise evaluations of nineteenth-century Jewish historiogra phy. It also provides an opportunity for Roemer to expose the reader to his impressive command of both the primary and secondary literature related to German Jewish historiography and individual Jewish historians, as well as works of general modem German historiography. The first two chapters dealing with early Wissenschaft, as well as the comparisons between the public reception of Leopold Zunz and Heinrich Graetz (63-65, 103-8), are particularly edifying. To my mind, however, the influence of the pioneering studies of Ismar Schorsch on our understanding of this period should have been acknowledged more promi nently. Roemer's sharp formulations come across impressively as well in his dis cussion of Graetz's role in the rise of what Salo Baron famously labeled "the lachrymose conception of Jewish history" and the relationship between this theme and the great popularity of Graetz's monumental Geschichte der Juden (62-65). As my own research focuses on religious history, I was acutely interested in the discussions of the role of historical study in the development of German Jewish denominationalism. Chapter 4 describes the rise of rabbinical seminaries in the mid-nineteenth century and their function in the dissemination of Wissenschaft des Judentums. In the context of his overall theme, Roemer juxtaposes these frameworks, which were dedicated to popular leadership but were the only insti tutions where scientific scholars of Judaism could find employment, with the more theoretically oriented German universities. Through their exposure to scien tific method, the rabbinical alumni of these practically directed seminaries became central facilitators in the transition of critical historical study to a catalyst for solidifying religious identification. Roemer presents Abraham Geiger, Zacharias Frankel and Graetz, and Esriel Hildesheimer, respectively, as paradigms of the Reform, positive-historical, and neo-Orthodox schools of thought in regard to Wissenschaft. He also refers to some of Samson Raphael Hirsch's vitriolic critiques of the works of Graetz and Frankel as representative of the neo-Orthodox perspec tive. Here, it should be pointed out that, as opposed to the consensus among the non-Orthodox camps regarding the basic value of critical study, even within the culturally modem sector of German Orthodoxy there were sharp debates on this subject. As Mordechai Breuer and David Ellenson have both demonstrated, virtually the same pejorative tone used with respect to Geiger and the Breslau figures was expressed by Hirsch in his attacks on the Hildesheimer's Orthodox Berlin Rabbinseminar and its moderate adoption of critical method. By contrast to its divisive use within mid-nineteenth-century internal religious polemics, the popularization of Wissenschaft toward the end of the century, according to Roemer, traversed denominational boundaries. The common experience of attending historical lectures and reading critical studies thus served as a unifying factor for all German Jewry. Though this is a reasonable understanding, I would suggest alternatively that this phenomenon may teach more about the pervasiveness of German high culture within Jewish circles, 429</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews regardless of religious observance and affiliation, than about drawing the various groups closer together. Aside from the growing eastern European immigrant popu lation, urban German Jewry most certainly shared a common cultural language. Whether this engendered any sense of unity, other than under the duress of visceral antisemitic attacks, is unclear. The issue of rising antisemitism in the late nineteenth century and the sub sequent emergence of German Zionism are also addressed by Roemer. He acknowledges their roles in encouraging late tum-of-the-century German Jews to rediscover their Jewish pasts, yet he insists that the transformation of Wis senschaft into a tool for strengthening religious identity existed alongside but sep arately from these forces. One way of evaluating the uniqueness of the German Jewish rum to history would be to compare it to parallel phenomena taking place among Jewish populations in eastern Europe. Hagit Cohen's recently pub lished book on the role of the Jewish bookstore in late nineteenth-century eastern European communal life offers one exemplary study that would serve as a fine foil for testing Roemer's work (Ba-hanuto shel mokher ha-sefarim). Having learned a great deal from this well-researched and clearly written monograph, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the emergence of modem Jewish historiography, as well as those students and scholars of Jewish studies who ponder its role in broader Jewish life.
