<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aaron W. Hughes. The Texture of the Divine: Imagination in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Thought. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2004. x, 273 pp. Three texts are scrutinized in this monograph: Hayy ibn Yaqzan (Alive son of Awake), the Epistle or philosophic "Recital" composed in Arabic prose by the Muslim sage ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037); Hayy ben Meqitz, the closely relat- ed Hebrew poem composed by the Andalusian Jewish sage Abraham ibn Ezra (1089-1164); and Hayy ibn Yaqzan, the more loosely related Arabic treatise com- posed by the Andalusian Muslim sage Abu Bakr ibn Tufayl (1116-1185). Each of 167</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the texts is well known to specialists in medieval intellectual history. Editions and critical discussions abound, almost all of them listed in the bibliography (pp. 245- 65). The Arabic texts have long been accessible in reliable English translations. Thanks to Aaron W. Hughes, the same can now be said for ibn Ezra's less familiar narrative poem. In the appendix (pp. 189-207), the poem is rendered into English based on the original Hebrew text published in 1983 by Israel Levin. The transla- tion is enhanced by references to the biblical idioms employed by ibn Ezra who in- geniously transformed ibn Sina's profoundly Islamic original into an equally stun- ning Hebrew gem. The value of Hughes's monograph far exceeds the welcome offering of an annotated English translation of ibn Ezra's poem. Levin's editorial agenda did not include the investigation of ibn Tufayl's classic. Levin also preferred to stress ma- jor differences between ibn Sina's "Epistle" and ibn Ezra's poem. On both counts, to our benefit, Hughes departs from Levin. Having noticed numerous stylistic and doctrinal affinities among these three diverse texts, Hughes argues that they con- stellate. First, he contends that the three medieval texts share a common origin in ancient prophetic revelations and apocalyptic ascents to heaven. Second, he pro- poses that the medieval texts belong to the same literary cycle or genre. This genre is distinguished by an elaborate fusion of technical philosophy with imaginative literature. Third, he maintains that the genre serves as literary surrogate to living psychopomps who lead their disciples to philosophically informed human perfec- tion. Hughes names the genre Neoplatonic "initiatory tales" (p. 19). The monograph's title is therefore more alluring than informative. Readers ought not expect to find a discussion of imagination in all of medieval Jewish and Islamic thought, especially its treatment among Sufis and Kabbalists. By "me- dieval thought," Hughes strictly means the eleventh- and twelfth-century Neopla- tonic philosophers, among whom he problematically includes Maimonides (p. 227 n. 61). Hughes apparently miscalculated Maimonides's critique of positive attri- butes and Neoplatonic aesthetics (pp. 103, 150). Readers will also not find a discussion of imagination in medieval Islamic theories of prophecy and political philosophy (p. 129). By imagination, Hughes strictly means the "inner eye," the human capacity that produces cataphatic images of the apophatic divine. Neoplatonic imagination, according to Hughes, forges stir- ring symbols of spiritual being out of the raw material of corporeal multiplicity and evanescent becoming. These symbols simultaneously affirm the physical or- der and enable human transcendence of that order as the prerequisite to soterio- logical "permanence" (p. 150). Neoplatonism, at least in its medieval Jewish and Islamic guises, therefore emerges in Hughes's exposition as less ascetic than schol- arly convention traditionally assumes. More so than the title, chapter headings indicate the true scope of authorial intention and accomplishment: "Reading the Divine: A User's Guide to the Initia- tory Tale" (pp. 13-47), "Reading Between the Lines: Text as Encounter with the Divine" (pp. 49-81), "Polishing a Dirty Mirror: The Philosophic Imagination" (pp. 82-114), "The Initiation of the Philosopher: Ritual Poetics and the Quest for Meaning" (pp. 115-145), and "'God is Beautiful and Loves Beauty': The Role of Aesthetics in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Philosophy" (pp. 146-184). The clus- 168</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews tered reiteration of "reading," "tale," "lines," "text," and "poetics" indicates that Hughes is less interested in exploring the tactile implications of the term "texture" than in mapping "the attempt to textualize the ineffable" (p. 1). Hughes contends that the three texts record visionary journeys across the Great Chain of Being. These journeys culminate in a trans-rational, religious encounter with divinity, the Neoplatonic "flight of the alone to the Alone," and that subsequent readers empa- thetically undergo similar journeys, attaining similar transformative encounters. "This visionary experience of God," according to Hughes, champion of philoso- phizing with literature, "can only occur within a rich narrative setting such as that which the reader encounters in" these tales (p. 40, emphasis added). The exclu- sivity of his claim is open to challenge. Scrupulous as he is in Chapters 1 and 3 to describe the historical circum- stances of the authors and to locate the three texts within their complex literary tra- ditions, Hughes is less conscientious in specifying the gender and predisposition of the "reader ... [who] is invited to experience the same journey as the [text's] protagonist" (p. 187). This is presumably the same "reader [who] is transformed and emerges as a different person when he or she finishes the tale" (p. 145). Vi- sionary experiences and literary texts are not synonymous. Texts are not machines infallibly producing uniform results; readers are not automatons. Not every me- dieval Jew or Muslim can be expected to have fancied Neoplatonic fictions. Con- fronting the texts, numerous medieval Jews or Muslims might have been left cold or provoked to object. Like Odysseus before them, and many moderns after them, including Friedrich Nietzsche and Martha Nussbaum (p. 212, nn.13-17), they might have resisted the bookish invitation to "transcend humanity." That Hughes seems unaware of these possibilities may be due to his exhilarating and learned immersion in the realm of embodied Neoplatonic aesthetics. His exposition of this relatively ignored, world-affirming realm will provide great pleasure to medieval- ists who love Neoplatonism and find aesthetics compelling. Kalman P.
