<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joel Beinin. The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Politics, and the Forma- tion of a Modern Diaspora. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. xii, 329 pp. During the past three decades, several major scholarly studies and person- al accounts of Egyptian Jewry have been published in Europe, Israel, and the United States.' Joel Beinin's book is the product of several years of research in Israel, Egypt, France, and the United States, in which he consulted not only books but also newspaper articles in English, French, Arabic, and Hebrew, as well as archives, among them the YIVO Institute records; the Haganah, Ha-Shomer ha- Tsa'ir, and the Central Zionist archives (Israel); the Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection of Yeshiva University (containing the records of the Cairo communi- ty); and the U.S. National Archives. He also interviewed Egyptian Jews and non- Jews. Beinin examines issues pertaining to the history of the Egyptian Jewish com- munities since the 1948 war, attempting to flesh out three areas: the life of the com- munity that chose to remain in Egypt from 1948 until the Sinai/Suez campaign of October 1956; the dispersion and resettlement of Egyptian Jews in North Ameri- ca, Europe, and Israel; and contested memories of Jewish life since the beginning of the Egyptian-Israeli mutual peace overtures leading to the Camp David Accords 1. The most noted scholarly publications include Jacob M. Landau, Jews in Nineteenth Centu- ry Egypt (New York: New York University Press, 1969); Gudrun Kramer, The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914-1952 (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989); Michael M.

One of his main arguments is that neither Egyptian nationalist nor Zion- ist narratives can properly tell the experience of Egypt's Jews. He therefore sets out to provide an alternative approach: an interdisciplinary analysis-including history, ethnography, literary criticism, and autobiography-to assess changing patterns of Jewish identity. Concerning the first area, Beinin has little to add. Kramer's The Jews ofMod- ern Egypt, Zohar's Tradition and Change, and my own Jews of Egypt more than cover the Jews' religious, social, and political evolution in the twentieth century to the end of the Nasser era. Andre Aciman's Out ofEgypt covers Muslim-Christian- Jewish relations in Egypt as an eyewitness account for the 1950s and 1960s. Op- eration Susannah by Aviezer Golan, a veteran Israeli journalist, published in 1978 by Harper &amp; Row, concentrates on the status of Egyptian-Jewish Zionists who faced trial for sabotage activity on Israel's behalf. Though Beinin is highly critical of this book, Golan adds much to our understanding of the political mood of young Jews at the beginning of the Nasser era. The main contribution of Beinin's book here is in providing some data on Zionism and on Jewish communists and a useful analysis of the small but dynam- ic community of Karaites. Yet, to offer a well-documented interdisciplinary analy- sis of Jewish life in Egypt after 1948, Beinin should have exploited more exten- sively the Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection, dug deep into the archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJDC) located in New York and Jerusalem, and consulted the Israel State Archives (ISA), whose records up to De- cember 1967 are now accessible. Grappling with this area of investigation, or when surveying scholarly liter- ature on the Jews of Muslim lands, Beinin tends to criticize rigorously those who do not share his views. They include Martin Gilbert, whose outlook on Arabs, Mus- lims, and Judeo-Muslim relations is regarded as "crude." Somewhat "less crude" is Norman A. Stillman, who nevertheless embraces a perspective similar to Gilbert's because he portrays the Jews as belonging to a discriminated minority that faced continual danger. In challenging other scholars, Beinin remarks on several occasions that Zionism was almost marginal in Egyptian Jewish life. Nothing could be further from the truth. True, Zionism in Egypt and other Muslim countries was indeed an elitist force or confined to groups belonging to the middle bourgeoisie and poor- er Ashkenazim. But this was also the case for most communities in the Diaspora- a phenomenon that did not deter activists from fund-raising, organizing aliyah, and sometimes extending their authority to challenge the established communal lead- ership. Zionism in Tunisia, after 1930, emerged as a vital contender in the strug- gle for communal leadership and influence in the Jewish milieu. During the vari- ous legal, illegal (underground), and semi-legal phases of aliyah, Zionist activists in Morocco-with or without Israeli sponsorship- formed a leadership core that pressured anti-Zionist or non-Zionist Jewish leaders to hasten communal self- liquidation. In Egypt, as in Iraq, the Zionist aliyah underground forces, until the early 1950s, were instrumental in initiating large-scale emigration to Israel. Of the 20,000 Jews who left Egypt in 1948-50, more than 14,000 immigrated to Israel 392</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews via Europe. They were prodded and organized for departure by the Israeli-spon- sored underground. In Iraq, a similar situation evolved with the local underground that conducted the aliyah of many thousands of Jews via the Syrian desert and Iran. During the years 1950-52, this underground, in conjunction with Israeli emis- saries, evacuated more than 120,000 Jews in a major operation with the consent of the Iraqi government. The degree of Zionist membership or increasing ideological conformity to Zionism in a given community is less crucial than the influence and initiative of those who succeeded in bringing about partial or large-scale depar- ture. Though much of the aliyah from Egypt occurred only in 1948-49 and 1956- 57, between 1948 and 1970 at least 35,971 of the 75,000-member community, or some 45-48%, chose Israel as their destination. The majority of the rest emigrat- ed to Europe, Australia, and the Americas. In treating the second area of dispersion and resettlement, Beinin's main groups are the Karaites who settled in Israel and North America, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, and communist and other leftist intellectuals living in France. His sections on the Karaite and communist emigres are quite good. Notwithstanding, the limited scope of his target groups prevented Beinin from reaching the less accessible "silent majority" of Egyptian Jews, many of whom are still alive, dispersed throughout Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Canada, Switzerland, France, Israel, England, and Australia. This is one of the major weaknesses of the book. The really hard work of finding Jews who represented the majority of Egyptian Jews has not been done. Their testimony is not heard here. It is virtually impossible to write about communal dispersion since 1948 without resorting to extensive questionnaires and interviewing large segments of the populations. I, myself, am conducting a major survey, using questionnaires and interviews, of North African Jews of different backgrounds and strata who settled in Israel, France, and the Americas since the late 1940s. Having thus far reached only 1,000 persons, I nevertheless am already getting a highly complex, nuanced, and diverse picture of conflicting identities and outlooks. By interviewing intel- lectuals with certain political orientations, among them Eric Rouleau and Jacques Hassoun, Beinin chose persons who reflect some of his own worldview. Conse- quently, the limited application and scope of his interdisciplinary approach hin- dered his efforts to offer a more in-depth narrative about the wider Egyptian Jew- ish experience. The third area of Beinin's book highlights contested memories of Egypt- ian-Jewish life since the Israeli-Egyptian peace overtures. Although some of the themes he raises here are pertinent and important, others do not actually relate to the book. The same is true for his enthusiastic endorsement of post-Zionist historiography (pp. 238-240). Whereas post-Zionist thinking and narrative of the past decade has its merits and is a refreshing approach to Israeli history, it is on the whole irrelevant to the issue of the dispersion of Egypt's Jews. The read- er may also wonder why Beinin chose to insert his autobiography and relate it to the topic. All in all, this book is another pioneering step in the area of research on the decline of Jewish minorities in Muslim lands and the crises they underwent in new 393</page><page sequence="4">AJS Review geographies.
