<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE IN HALAKHIC LITERATURE by AVI SAGI Introduction The status of religious authority and the obligation to obey its rulings are crucial concerns of traditional societies, and they are repeatedly voiced in halakhic literature. The ways in which traditional societies contend with these issues may be indicative of a basic ethos, extending far beyond the level of interpersonal relations. As it is embodied in certain persons or institutions, authority often reflects not only a necessary social order but also the most basic values of a traditional culture. In this article I present two models of authority, in an attempt to suggest guidelines for a discussion on the meaning and power of halakhic authority and the corresponding duty of obedience. Although my approach is analytical, it is not merely an abstract, theoretical construction; instead, it entails an attempt to reveal the presence of these models in the empirical course of Jewish tradition. A larger and more detailed historical study, resting on theoretical foundations, is no doubt required. The discussion deals with ideal types which, by definition, cannot convey the variety and uniqueness of empirical reality. Nevertheless, ideal types are extremely important because they suggest a construct against which existing cases might be compared, and a standard for judging deviations.' It is my contention that Jewish tradition offers two main models of authority, which, 1.

AJS Review 20/1 (1995): 1-24 1</page><page sequence="2">2 AVI SAGI relying on the typology offered by De George,2 will be termed epistemic and deontic. These two models differ regarding such fundamental questions as authority's source of legitimation, the duty of obedience incumbent on community members acknowledging this authority, and the relation between the authorities and other members of the community. I consider first the model of epistemic authority, and its prevalence in Jewish sources. The Epistemnic Model of Halakhic Authority According to the epistemic model, authority derives legitimation from the possession of knowledge in a certain realm. A person in authority thus enjoys an advantage over all others who lack this knowledge, and his authority rests on this advantage. As Jenkins has indicated, however, this model cannot assume that only persons in authority possess the requisite knowledge while all others are totally ignorant, since knowledge is not a personal feature, as is, for instance, black hair. Instead, authority describes the relation of individuals or of a group toward someone whose authority rests on their acknowledgment.3 Admitting that someone is knowledgeable, however, demands a modicum of understanding in the field in question. Einstein is considered an authority in physics because the community of physicists recognizes his special acumen; the relation between Einstein and other physicists does not rest on personal feelings but on a shared area of knowledge. Jenkins argues that authority-whether epistemic or deontic-never rests solely on an ability to wield power or on a legal system, but on a broader background: a social framework, a moral system, a set of personal relations, or a cultural context.4 While one could question the scope of this generalization, it certainly applies to epistemic authority, which is clearly dependent on knowledge. For a discussion of the concept of ideal types, see M. Weber, Gesammnlte Aufsatrze zur Wissenschafts Lehre, ed. Johannes Winckelman, 5th ed. (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1982), pp. 146-214. 2. R. T.

Ibid., pp. 159-160.</page><page sequence="3">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 3 In this model, then, the difference between an authority and other members of the community is not absolute, unlike that between a ruler and his subjects. Epistemic authority rests on a certain type of knowledge shared by all members of the community. Knowledge, however, acts both as the source of authority and also as its restraining factor. Einstein has no more authority than other physicists to invent physical laws at will and impose them as legitimate knowledge, and the difference between him and others is that he knows more and can adduce better proof for his views. Since authority rests on knowledge, at least in principle, it is only temporary. As soon as someone's attainments are on a par with those of persons in authority, the latter lose their power to teach or command. De George has even argued that epistemic authority is not really authority in the strict sense of the term, since it cannot command performance. It can suggest, advise, or recommend, but it cannot impose obligations. In the terms of this model, then, it would be inaccurate to say that a command issued by an authority creates a duty of obedience. Members of the community are willing to give credit to an authority concerning matters they do not yet know or know less of, and are ready to believe that the authorities' instructions reflect superior knowledge. In and of themselves, however, these instructions are not a sufficient condition for obedience, particularly when they challenge the knowledge shared by all community members. The epistemic model thus assumes that, at least in principle, all members of the community are equal and potentially capable of assuming authority, depending on their efforts and achievements. Armed with this schematic description, we may now proceed to consider the prevalence of this model of authority within Jewish sources. Support for it can be found in a source as early as the Talmud. Is it possible that if they tell you about right that it is left, and about left that it is right, that you should listen to them? Scripture says "to the right or to the left," meaning that [one should follow the sages' instructions only if] they tell you about right that it is right and about left that it is left. (J.T. Horayot 1:1) The assumption underlying this approach is that, since the authority of the sages is epistemic, the obligation to comply with their rulings applies only when they are true and, moreover, that every individual is equally entitled to make judgments concerning their truth. The authority of the rabbis rests on</page><page sequence="4">4 AVI SAGI their knowledge of Torah, and obeying them when they are wrong is mistaken and even forbidden, as we are explicitly told elsewhere. If the court issued a ruling and one of them knew they had erred, or a disciple who was himself capable of ruling on matters of law acted in accordance with their ruling, whether they acted and he acted with them ... he is liable, since he was not dependent upon the ruling of the court. (M. Horayot 1:1) The Talmud explains the nature of the mistake requiring the disciple to offer a sacrifice: "as he knew it was prohibited, but erred concerning the commandment to obey the sages" (Horayot 2b). In other words, the fact that an authority ordered a specific act is not a sufficient reason for obeying a wrong instruction. In this case, obedience is mistaken, and compliance is a sign of misunderstanding. Similarly, it is also claimed that if a court has ruled against "a prohibition which the Sadducees admit" and someone acted on their ruling, the court is exempt because "anyone could learn this at school" (Horayot 4a). Namely, given a presupposition of common knowledge, a court ruling has no standing and cannot be used to exempt a community member from responsibility. Rabbis who support this model tend to restrict the special standing of a formal court ruling, and one talmudic approach indeed argues that Bet Shammai acted in line with their own beliefs because "they were keener of intellect [than Bet Hillel]" (Yevamot 14a). The status of the judges is thus contingent on their knowledge of Torah, as Rav Tsa'ir stated: "The sages are bound to one another by the wisdom of the law rather than by its power."' Hence, talmudic sages did not ascribe special importance to judicial rulings.6 Albeck argues that this model of authority is peculiar to talmudic tradition,7 and claims it is precisely on these grounds that the tradition argues that "an individual is allowed to make his own rulings, as if he were a court."8 The dispute between R. Eliezer and the sages concerning "the oven of Akhnai" (Baba Metsiah 59b) would appear to lend strong support to a deontic 5. H. Tchernowitz, Toledot Ha-Halakha, pt. 1, p. 164. 6. Ibid., p. 165. 7. S.

Sec also his detailed discussion in chap. 4.</page><page sequence="5">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 5 model of authority, suggesting a confrontation between truth, as represented by R. Eliezer, and authority, as represented by the sages. Nevertheless, many of the sages who comment on this passage rely on an epistemic model. Thus, for instance, R. Nissim Gaon offers two interpretations. According to the first, the heavenly voice did not utter a final verdict-"the heavenly voice was indeed vague, and may have been accurate everywhere except here."' In other words, R. Eliezer was actually wrong, and ruling in favor of the sages was the logical decision in this case. In a second, more radical interpretation, R. Nissim suggests that the heavenly voice is not an organon for disclosing truth: "God's Torah is complete and has already been given to us at Sinai, and He has advised us that nothing will be changed in it, and no contradictions or doubts remain in our Torah that would require a sign from Heaven." Human beings can discover truth and need not resort to supernatural devices. R. Hirschensohn is one of the most prominent advocates of this approach among modem halakhists. The command to heed the sages only applies when the sages are versed in His commands ... and I too was wrtong regarding the conmmand to heed thenm, because the truth is that, even when ordered, he should not heed them when he knows they are mistaken. Only when we say that "even when acting unwittingly, or mistakenly, or wantonly" the court still has the power to enforce its rulings, must he heed them even when they are wrong, but if they lack this power, he is forbidden to follow their dictates. And if he does, he is wrong concerning the command to heed the sages.'0 R. Hirschensohn's approach is quite unique, since he argues that, when faced with a rabbinical mistake, not only are we allowed to act against rabbinical instructions but we are forbidden to comply with them. All the sources so far examined share a concern with the limits of obedience, and all agree that obedience is not an unconditional obligation. Prima facie, individuals are bound to comply, but this obligation assumes that the sages know the Torah. If the sages are mistaken, however, one is allowed not to obey them and may even be forbidden to do so. The binding duty of a Jewish individual is, first and foremost, to the Torah rather than to the sages, whose authority rests on their knowledge rather than on an arbitrary power to command whatever they wish. 9. Shitah Mekuberset, Baba Metsiah 59b. 10. Malki Ba-Kodesh, pt. 2, p. 74 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="6">6 AVI SAGI We may also infer the presence of the epistemic model from an analysis of the sages' attitudes to their own authority, and I have chosen two examples to illustrate this point. One concerns the halakhic dispute concerning "the forbidding sage," and the other deals with the deference disciples owe their teachers. In line with Avodah Zarah 7a, R. Moses Isserles rules: If a sage has forbidden a certain matter, another sage is not permitted to allow it on the basis of his own judgment, though he may do so if he has learned from his own teachers that [the first sage] was mistaken ... or if he has erred in his understanding of the Mishnah." Halakhic literature deals at great length with the meaning and scope of the ruling in Avodah Zarah 7a. R. Nissim suggests an interesting approach, restricting the application of this principle. I believe that, even if his judgment is mistaken, his [the first sage's] instruction is retracted only with his agreement. When it is said that a sage is not permitted to allow what another has forbidden without obtaining the former's agreement, it is because of the former's honor. Moreover, that the one Torah should not become two Torahs, with these forbidding and these allowing .... But were the former to hear the claims suggested by the latter and admit to a mistake in judgment, or even if the former will not admit to a mistake but the second surpasses him, then the latter can annul the ruling of the former and allow what the former has forbidden. This is how it appears to me in principle, although in practice I have no strength to challenge the pillars of the world." R. Nissim restricts rabbinic authority. He views authority as a crucial factor in ensuring the unity and uniformity of halakhah, and also considers rabbinic honor extremely important. Deference is indeed a precondition for the survival of any legal system, but in a confrontation between authority and wisdom, R. Nissim argues that the latter is to be preferred, and a sage possesing superior knowledge can allow what another has forbidden. 11. Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 242:31. 12. Commentary on Avodah Zarah 7a, s.v. hanish 'al la-hakhanm. The phrase "pillars of the world" refers to R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres (Ha-Ra'avad), whom R. Nissim quotes at the opening of this passage. The views of Ha-Ra'avad are discussed more extensively in the context of the deontic model.</page><page sequence="7">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 7 This passage reveals R. Nissim as a supporter of the epistemic model of authority while also pointing to the problems posed by the adoption of this model which, eventually, could undermine the halakhic system altogether. Normative uniformity might be hampered if all who are sufficiently versed in halakhah were endowed with authority. R. Nissim relies on two devices to balance the need for uniformity with the assumption that authority is contingent on knowledge: a ruling can be changed either with the consent of the former sage or because of his greater wisdom. R. Nissim felt that he lacked the strength to challenge "pillars of the world" like R. Abraham b. David of Posquieres. R. Abraham had sided with a deontic model and argued that an instruction from the Talmud is final-"and he is not permitted to allow ... even if he surpasses him in wisdom and numbers." In his commentary on the Shulhan Arukh, however, R. Sabbetai Cohen adopts R. Nissim's theoretical model and turns it into a plausible and practical halakhic ruling.'" Note that R. Itshak Dov Bamberger relied on this interpretation in his ruling against R. Samson Raphael Hirsch. When answering R. Hirsch's claim that he had trangressed the principle of the forbidding sage,14 R. Bamberger relied on the option suggested by R. Sabbetai Cohen: "This principle applies only when the rabbinic authority of both judges is equal, but if the latter distinctly excels the former, he need not take into account an extant ruling he considers mistaken."'5 In sum, rabbinic authority is contingent on knowledge and hence is not absolute. Let us now turn to the second example. Talmudic tradition forbids a disciple to rule in the presence of his master.'6 Maimonides indeed rules in this spirit. Whoever distrusts the authority of his teacher-it is as if he disputes with the Shekhinah. ... And who is to be regarded as disputing his teacher's authority? One who sets up a school, holds sessions, and teaches without his teacher's 13. See Siftei Cohen, Shulhan Arukh, loc. cit. 14. For R. Hirsch's responsum, see his Shenmesh Malpeh, 52. 15. See Y.

To rule in his teacher's presence is forbidden at all times, and whoever rules in his teacher's presence deserves death."7 This ruling does not necessarily entail support for a deontic model of authority, since it is justified in terms of the honor rather than the authority of the teacher, namely, it rests on the special relationship prevailing between a teacher and his disciples rather than on that between an authority and those subject to him. However, it is clear that sages who restrict the application of these norms, or even cancel them altogether, favor an epistemic model. In the thirteenth-century Hqgahot Maimoniot, R. Meir Hacohen quotes his teacher, R. Meir of Rothenburg, who considerably restricted the scope of this injunction: Our teacher also taught that a person who finds an explicit ruling in a book by any of the geonim is allowed to rule in line with it, even during his teacher's life and even if he is a mere disciple, but he should never follow his own understanding when ruling, nor should he rely on his own evidence or on his own analogies.'8 This tradition argues that neither the rabbi's honor nor his broad knowledge can be considered a valid argument against unquestionable evidence, even if this evidence is adduced by "a mere disciple." R. Meir Hacohen does not explain the reasons for this restriction, but quite obviously he is assuming that the rabbi's authority is derived from his knowledge. It is therefore wrong for a disciple to question his teacher on the basis of his own opinion, as it is precisely the teacher's wider knowledge that distinguishes him from his students. However, the distinction between them is not an essential one, since both are equally bound to objective sources of knowledge, namely, to the texts making up the corpus of halakhah. Consequently, whenever the teacher's rulings are out of line with these texts, the student is permitted to rule in his teacher's presence. In other words, in a conflict between the person in authority (the rabbi) and the source of authority (the texts of halakhic literature), the latter prevails. R. Meir had only attempted to limit the scope of this principle, but other sages went further and, on similar grounds, totally rejected the halakhic 17. Hilkhot Talmud Torah 5:1-2; see also Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 242. 18. Hagahot Maimoniot, Hilkhot Talmud Torah 5:1-2, c.</page><page sequence="9">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 9 tradition represented by Maimonides. R. Asher of Lunel writes in Orhot Hayyiim: R. Samuel of Evreux (the teacher of R. Yonah, of blessed memory) and his brother wrote in their letters: Since our forefathers went into exile, and our Temple was destroyed, and the lands were confused, and wisdom and knowledge have dwindled, we can no longer say that the reverence for thy teacher is as the fear of Heaven. All the rulings concerning the proper behavior of disciples toward their teacher have now been canceled, because the teachers are now the genmarot, and the commentaries, and the novellae and the writings, all according to the wisdom of each heart. Which is why it was customary in their places for disciples to rely on a midrash. .. and an able student could contradict his teacher on the basis of his own reasoning.'9 This approach points to the basis of rabbinic authority in explicit terms: knowledge of the halakhic text. Hence, a ruling that forbids any form of challenge to rabbinic authority appears groundless. R. Samuel of Evreux and his brother, however, do not explain what motivated them to question this ancient tradition and suggest only a vague formulation--exile and dwindling hearts-without offering any reason or justification for the proposed change. R. Samuel de Medina suggests an interesting approach in the following passage, which also includes a reference to Orhot Hay),im: As for whether we should distinguish between our own and talmudic times, I believe it is clear that a distinction is required, and we should say that all these statements applied during talmudic times, when all rulings were dictated by logic and everything was oral, and whoever ruled was called a true judge. But in our times, it is not the sage who rules but the book, and if we see that the rabbi is experienced and versed in the text, that he reasons well and is knowledgeable and understanding, needless to say he can rule among his peers, but also in places where there is someone greater than him.20 R. Samuel de Medina thus assumes that this ruling reflects an historical fact rather than a deontic perception of rabbinic authority. The option of relying on an objective corpus of knowledge, such as books, was nonexistent during the talmudic period, forcing all to rely on the authority of the sages, 19.

Moshe Provengal, Responsa 6.</page><page sequence="10">10 AVI SAGI who were the only bearers of halakhah. This may have blurred the fact that authority rests with the book rather than with the teacher. Once the texts became available to everyone, however, rabbinic authority is clearly revealed as epistemic. The vague formulations of thirteenth-century tosafists like R. Samuel of Evreux and R. Asher of Lunel contrast with the clear statement of a sixteenth-century sage like R. Samuel de Medina. The differences between them may reflect changes arising from the invention of printing and the increasing availability of books. Whereas the former had witnessed the growing diffusion of talmudic texts, printing made talmudic books and other works accessible to all. Although sensitive to the ongoing changes, R. Samuel of Evreux and his contemporaries did not take a stand concerning their religious meaning. In contrast, R. Samuel de Medina, who lived long after the revolution prompted by the invention of printing, ascribed religious meaning to its consequences: authority was no longer invested in the rabbi but in the text. The epistemic model thus assumes the equality of all community members before the Torah, which belongs to the whole of Israel. All Israel have an equal share in the Torah. Both the Written and the Oral Law were given to every individual in Israel to study and observe in the most meticulous fashion. No individual is entrusted with the task of preserving the Torah more than any other, and no command will be better performed by an emissary rather than by oneself, or more properly complied with through a mediator than by a member of the Jewish people.2' According to this model, the supreme obligation incumbent on every indi- vidual is the study of Torah, since a knowledge of Torah is the basis of all individual duties. This model fosters an ethos of personal responsibility and may, at times, be critical of views endorsed by previous sages, as R. Ya'akov Emden suggested. No one should, from now on, seek exemption on mistaken grounds and relieve himself of the burden [of decision] by heeding a sinful instinct idly claiming that questioning your ancestors' words (written after the closure of the Talmud) is like eating from the tree of knowledge. . . . Any wise man will easily understand that this claim is false. Let him not believe in unfounded deceit, let 21. Albeck, Law Courts in Talmudic Times, p. 19.</page><page sequence="11">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 11 him know that his soul is capable of understanding, and that it was given to him by God. To know good from evil and truth from its opposite, this is God's wisdom inside him. Because there is spirit in human beings, one God created us all ... and He endowed us with an understanding heart. He did not mean this to be a heart of stone, deprived of the reason shaped in God's image, [but one] to attain knowledge of His truth and the words of His Torah. In one's own heart, one should tell himself, "If it is not [incumbent] upon me to finish the work, neither am I free to refrain from it." The Deontic Model of Halakhic Authority Jewish tradition offers an alternative approach to the meaning of halakhic authority-the deontic model. This model can claim deep roots in talmudic sources, as well as support from contemporary halakhists. The basic assumptions of this model state that an authority can validly order certain acts to be performed, and can also compel other members of the community to obey. Rather than on knowledge, deontic authority is based on the power invested in the person in authority to determine binding norms. Conceptually, deontic authority implies an obligation of unconditional obedience, meaning that an authority must always be obeyed, even when apparently wrong. The epistemic model of authority stresses that knowledge is binding on all members of the community, whereas the deontic model emphasizes the special status of the authorities. What makes deontic authority valid? Two justifications of deontic author- ity can be found in modern political and philosophical writings. Following Jenkins, one argues that deontic authority reflects the agreement of community members to invest individuals or institutions with the power to dictate norms. The other claims that authority must obtain its legitimation from within the legal system, rather than from a nonlegal source such as public consent. This approach, formulated by theorists like Kelsen and and Hart, is sometimes referred to as the positivist theory of law. An assumption shared by different versions of this theory is that the concept of legal authority assumes the prior existence of a legal system that validates this authority. The difference between these two justifications of deontic authority thus hinges on the 22. Lehem Shamayim, pt. 1, introduction. For further analysis, see A. Sagi, It Is Not in Heaven: Issues in the Philosophy of Halakha [Heb.] (Ein Tsurim: Herzog Institute for Jewish Studies, 1993), chap. 7.</page><page sequence="12">12 AVI SAGI answer to the following question: Does authority precede the legal system, or is the legal system itself constitutive of authority?23 Do supporters of deontic authority within Jewish tradition rely on similar considerations? Let us consider a number of sources endorsing this model. "'To the right hand or to the left': even if they point out to you that right is left and left is right, obey them."24 This formulation seems somewhat ambiguous. The phrase "point out to you" could be taken to mean that the contradiction between the Torah and the rabbinic instruction is only apparent, as indicated by R. Meir Loeb [Malbim]: And regarding what it says "right and left," even if you imagine that they are turning left into right, nevertheless "thou shalt not deviate," because halakhah is really as they [the rabbis] say, and the Torah was given subject to their judgment, and God's spirit will guide their rulings of halakhah, and they will not err.25 Ha-Malbim thus interprets this midrash according to the assumptions of the epistemic model. In contrast, Rashi's conclusion is unequivocal: "Even if he tells you about the right that it is left or about the left that it is right" (Deut. 17:11). Rashi appears to imply that even a rabbinic instruction patently opposed to a Torah command must be obeyed; indeed, this was R. Judah Loew's understanding of Rashi's stance. It seems that even if they actually said about right that it is left and about left that it is right. That even if a ruling is extant from the Great Court in Jerusalem, and another court has now told him the opposite of what he had previously heard from a majority greater in wisdom and numbers, even so it is written "Thou shalt not deviate . .."26 An individual is bound to obey the instructions of authority, regardless of whether the instructions correspond with his personal knowledge. Authorities are entitled to issue orders, and these orders must be complied with regardless 23. Compare Jenkins, Social Order and the Limits of Law, p. 159. Note that Jenkins does not adopt the positivist theory and views the legal system as part of a broader social context which, in turn, serves to justify and validate the legal system. 24.

Gur Arieh, Deut. 17:11.</page><page sequence="13">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 13 of their truth. Later supporters of the deontic model relied on the Sifrei and on Rashi. The most prominent advocate of this model is Nahmanides, who discusses these questions at great length in his Commentary on the Torah (Deut. 17:11) and in his Hasagot Lesefer Hamitzvot. In the former work he formulates the duty of obedience as follows: Even if you think in your heart that they are mistaken, and the matter is simple in your eyes just as you know [the difference] between your right hand and your left hand, you must still do as they command you. You are not to say: "How can I [permit myself to] eat this real forbidden fat, or execute this innocent man?" Instead, you are to say: "The Lord, who enjoined the commandments, commanded that I perform all His commandments in accordance with all that they, who stand before Him in the place that He shall choose, teach me to do. He gave me the Torah as taught by them, even if they were to err." Nahmanides points to the event concerning the dating of the Day of Atonement (Rosh Hashanah 25a). R. Joshua bows to Rabban Gamaliel's command, although believing him to be mistaken, and Nahmanides cites this as an instance of deontic authority. But this parallel seems strange, as rabbinic authority concerning the calendar is a unique prerogative, whereas Nahmanides places the whole Torah and not only the calendar within the purview of rabbinic decision, ruling out any corpus of knowledge independent of the authority of the rabbis. In his Hasagot Lesefer Hamitzvot, Nahmanides suggests an interesting comparison between the Sadducees and the rebellious elder that sheds further light on his approach: "And whatever the majority decides, this is what the Torah has commanded us. And whoever transgresses becomes a rebel- lious elder . . . and these are the cursed Sadducees, who in the East are called Karaites."27 Maimonides' followers found this comparison extremely puzzling, since the Sadducees deny the Oral Law altogether, while the rebellious elder does not.28 However, if we assume that the written Torah cannot be distinguished from the bearers of authority, then the Sadducees and the rebellious elder are both guilty of the same transgression, namely, an 27.

Hanania Cassis's commentary on Sefer Hamitzvot, Kin'at Soferim, ad loc.</page><page sequence="14">14 AVI SAGI attempt to create an objective corpus of knowledge independent of rabbinic judgments.29 Nahmanides understands that his approach, which endorses deontic au- thority, is incompatible with the talmudic passage in Horayot 2b, which adopts an epistemic model. He suggests a radical view, placing deontic and epistemic authority in a clearly hierarchical relation. If a sage fit to rule lived at the time of the Sanhedrin, and the Great Court ruled that a certain matter should be allowed and he believes they made a mistake, he must not heed the sages and he is not permitted to allow himself something forbidden, and he must be strict with himself. This is most certainly the case if he himself sits in the Great Court. He should then come before them and argue his case, and they will discuss it with him. And if they agree to reject his view and confuse his reasoning, he must retract and act in line with their ruling, after they have considered his claim and dismissed it. This is what emerges from these rulings. In any event, he must accept their ruling after they have considered it.3? This approach clarifies very precisely the decisive status of deontic authority. An individual is not bound to obey the sages as long as his objections have not been discussed. However, once these objections have been duly considered, the duty of obedience is unconditional. This obligation does not rest on the conviction that the sages are right, but on the "agreement" reached within the authorized institution.31 29. It could possibly be claimed that Nahmanides is not endorsing a deontic model and simply believes there is no objective corpus of knowledge-the Torah is only what the rabbis say. Kirschenbaum explicitly suggests this view when he claims that, according to Nahmanides, "there is no 'objective' right, and 'right' is what the sages of Israel say is 'right."' See A. Kirschenbaum, "Equity and Jewish Law," Da'at 13 (1984): 50. In my view, however, Nahmanides does acknowledge the existence of an objective corpus. His statement "He gave me the Torah as taught by them, even if they were to err" indicates that he foresees the possibility of a conflict between the Torah and a rabbinical decision. For an analysis of Nahmanides' position, see A. Sagi, "Decision Making and Objective Truth in Halakha: Some Considerations Regarding the Philosophy of Halakha" [Heb.], Dine Israel 15 (1989-90): 28-37; idem, "Halakhic Praxis and the Word of God: A Study of Two Models," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 1 (1992): 320-321; idem, "The Relationship between Peshat and Derash" [Heb.], Tarbiz 61 (1992): 583-592. 30.

Nahmanides explicitly relies on the first when he claims that the duty to obey the sages rests on the divine command "Thou shalt not deviate."34 R. Elhanan Wasserman also argues that the duty to obey rabbinic legislation cannot be anchored on a nonlegal consideration, unlike R. Simeon Skop, who justifies it in rational, nonlegal terms.35 R. Wasserman raises a formal consideration: "If we say36 that sevara dictates this, it follows that rabbinic rulings are from the Torah, as we find it said everywhere 'why do I need a verse, it is a sevara,' meaning that the same rules apply both to a sevara and to the Torah."37 In other words, if the reason for obeying rabbinic legislation is rational understanding, and if the status of a sevara is equal to that of a biblical injuction, rabbinic rulings are just as valid as the Torah. Therefore, R. heed their ruling" (Sha'ar Yosef Horayot [Livorno, 1757], p. 11). This interpretation seems implausible, however, and the one I suggested is also the one endorsed by R. Z. H. Heyyot: "Nahmanides did not claim that [he should heed them] only when they have all agreed to reject his claim. Whether they have answered his objections reasonably and logically, or told him they have all agreed to reject his claims for no reason, the majority is heeded even when they say about the right that it is left" (see The Complete Works [Jerusalem: Divrei Hakhamim, 1958], pt. I, p. 377). 32. See, for instance, Derashot Ha-Ran, Feldman ed. (Jerusalem, 1977), p. 112; H. Crescas, Or Elohinm III, rule 5, chap. 2, and others. 33. In principle, the justification of hermeneutical authority may differ from that of legislative authority, and Maimonides and Nahmanides indeed disagreed on this count. See Sefer Hantitzvot II and Nahmanides' objection ad loc. I do not deal with this distinction in the following discussion. 34. Maimonides applies this argument to the hermeneutical as well as the legislative dimension of rabbinical activity, whereas Nahmanides limits it to the legislative realm. 35. See A. Sagi, "Between a Religious Commandment and a Legal Obligation: On the Halakhic Thought of R. Simeon Skop" [Heb.], Da'at, in press, and idem, It Is Not in Heaven, chap. 2, source 20. 36. As R. Simeon does, when he argues that the basis of halakhic authority is a rational sevara. 37. R. E. Wasserman, "Kuntres Divrei Soferim," in Kovets Shi'urinm, pt. 2 (Tel Aviv, 1963), p. 3. R. Wasserman was obviously not aware of R. Simeon's view when writing this, as R. Simeon does address this question. See also R. M. S. Cohen of Dvinsk, Mashakh Hokhmah on Deut. 17:11; R. M. Amiel, Darkei Moshe (Tel Aviv, 1983), I, chaps. 4-6.</page><page sequence="16">16 AVI SAGI Wasserman argues that the duty of complying with rabbinic authority rests on the following basis: "We must do as they say because we thereby fulfill His will, may He be blessed, that their will agree with His will" (ibid.). A rational, autonomous value system lacks compelling religious authority for R. Wasserman, and only God's command can impose an obligation of obedience. What is the scope of this command? Is it limited to a specific institution, such as the Sanhedrin, or to a particular place, such as Lishkat ha-Gazit, or is it incumbent on all rabbinic rulings? Some tend to restrict the scope of this argument, while others broaden it.38 For my purpose, it is worth stressing that this argument, like the positivist theory of law, assumes that halakhic authority derives its legitimation from within the system. The second argument, divine inspiration, goes back as far as geonic literature. For instance, R. Samuel b. Ali ascribes charismatic powers to the residence of the geonim: "The seat is the chair of Torah which is in Moses' place, of blessed memory . . and the religion of Israel will be fulfilled there, and whoever contests this, challenges the Master of the Torah."39 Many 38. It could be argued that these sources are irrelevant to a general discussion of models of authority, as they only apply to one specific and well-defined authority-the Sanhedrin. Halakhic literature, however, reveals a more complex picture. Maimonides indeed narrows the scope of application of this verse to the Great Court in Jerusalem (Hilkhot Mamrim 1:1-2). In talmudic sources, it is made to pertain to the "court in Yavneh" (see Sifrei, Mishpatim 153; JT Sanhedrin 11:3). Other sources, however, broaden its scope. See for instance R. Nissim, who supports the deontic model: "The sages in all generations have been empowered to decide regarding rabbinic disputes as they see fit ... and we have been commanded to abide by their decisions, whether or not they are in line with the truth" (Derashot Ha-Ran, p. 112 [emphasis added]; see also pp. 85-86 and She'iltot, Mishpatim 58). Note that Sefer Ha-Hinukh states that the main obligation is to "abide by the Great Court and do all they have commanded . . . and this commandment is valid when the Great Court is in Jerusalem." It then proceeds to claim, however, that "included in this commandment is also the obligation to abide by the instructions of the judge at all times" (Sefer Ha-Hinukh, Chavel ed. [Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1962], commandment 492, p. 650 [emphasis added]). See also Y. Horowitz, Shnei Luhot Ha-Berith (Jerusalem, 1963), chap. 4, p. 2. I also discuss below the views of R. Elyiahu Hamizrahi, who understands the verse "thou shalt not deviate" in broad terms. As the view endorsing a broad application of the verse requiring complicance with rabbinic instructions at all times is supported by several sages, it is clear that sources relying on this verse are relevant to a discussion about models of authority. 39. S. Assaf, "The Letters of R. Samuel b. Ali" [Heb.], Tarbiz 1 (1930): 64.</page><page sequence="17">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 17 sages support the notion of divine inspiration, among them Judah Halevi,40 and Nahmanides is extensively quoted in this context: "Because God's spirit is upon the ministers of His Sanctuary, and He forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved forever from error and stumbling."'4 R. Jacob of Marvege also endorses this view,42 which, in modern times, has been particularly emphasized, among others, by R. Dessler43 and R. Karelitz.44 Reliance on the notion of charisma to justify halakhic rulings tends to be more widespread during times of crisis. For instance, this argument was quite prevalent at the time of the geonim and of R. Judah Halevi, as part of their struggle to assert the authority of rabbinic Judaism against the Karaites. Ultra-Orthodox rabbis, who find their authority significantly curtailed in modern times, and particularly after the Holocaust, also tend to rely on it.45 Since charisma assures the sage he is in possession of the truth, the charismatic argument could be perceived as lending support to the epistemic model, although the two are certainly far apart. Whereas the underlying assumption of the epistemic model is that truth is equally open to all, the charismatic argument stresses the unique status of authority and delegitimizes any attempt to challenge it, on the grounds that its rulings are endowed with God's grace. The third argument, public consent, is suggested by R. Eliyahu Hamizrahi: "This is the power granted to the Great Court in Jerusalem and to every single court at all times . . . that in every generation the people rely on the edicts, the rulings, and the proceedings of the court."46 40.

Eliyahu Mizrahi, Responsa, no. 57.</page><page sequence="18">18 AVI SAGI Two modern halakhists, R. Kook and R. Hirschensohn, have also argued that authority rests on public consent. All the rabbinic commandments that we observe rest, fundamentally, on their acceptance by the "the whole people." ... Although our rabbis justified them on the grounds of "thou shalt not deviate," nevertheless, they clearly rely on public consent.47 R. Hirschensohn developed the notion of public consent even further, pointing to it as the basis for complying with the commands of the Torah. A detailed analysis of his view on this subject is beyond the scope of this paper,48 and I quote only a short passage from his writings. Our duty to the Torah flows from the covenant drawn with all the command- ments .... And it was only after the people entered this covenant and willingly agreed to take the oath that they chose judges and elders charged with ensuring compliance, as is the case with any constitution, which is adopted before a people comes into being and then serves to bestow power on the people's judges and elders. And the people of Israel had this power when they received the Torah, and have since kept it forever... The power of the court is mainly the power of the people, and without it, the court has no power at all.49 The claim raised by R. Hirschensohn in this passage resembles a classic argument whereby the validity of a legal system is contingent on public con- sent, implying that the system is justified in nonlegal, and even nonreligious, terms.50 The nature of the arguments adduced in support of the deontic model may affect the status of halakhic authority. Thus, for instance, if authority rests on God's command, and if this command relates to a specific context, such as the Temple or the Sanhedrin's residence, then other people or other institutions can lay no claim to authority. Hence, if this scheme leaves any room at all for deontic authority, it will have to be justified in other terms.5' Similarly, if 47. Adar Hayakar, p. 39. 48. See E.

See introduction to the Mishneh Torah. 51. The responsum (271) by R. Zevi Joshua Horowitz (Ha-Ribash), is particularly illumi- nating in this context. He dismisses the first argument as a basis for rabbinical authority in his</page><page sequence="19">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 19 the source of authority is public consent, its power is directly proportional to the measure of consent. Hence, Maimonides argues that the deontic authority of local courts, and even of geonim, extends only as far as the measure of public consent it can muster and, contrary to the Talmud, that the rulings of local courts and those of the geonim "have not spread throughout Israel."52 The need for deontic authority is clear. A discussion of the arguments in its favor advanced in philosophical-political writings is beyond the scope of this paper, and I shall confine myself to the justifications offered by Jewish sources. Nahmanides had already pointed out in his Commentaly on the Torah (Deut. 17:10) that, in the absence of deontic authority, normative uniformity might be hampered. Now the need for this commandment is very great, for the Torah was given to us in written form, and it is known that not all opinions concur on newly arising matters. Disagreements would thus increase and the one Torah would become many Torahs. Scripture, therefore, defined the law that we are to obey the Great Court ... even if appears to you to exchange right for left. The author of Sefer Ha-Hinukh goes a step further and suggests a contrast between truth and uniformity. Had we been commanded to obey the Torah as far as we may grasp its true intention, everyone in Israel could say, "I believe this to be the truth in this matter," and even if the whole world were to say the opposite, he would not be permitted to act against what he believes to be the truth. Disaster would then ensue, as the one Torah would become many Torahs and each person would rule according to his own belief. Now, however, when we have been explicitly commanded to comply with the sages' majority view, there is one Torah for all of us and our survival hinges on it, and we must not stray from their views, no matter what.53 This passage thus assumes that if a halakhic ruling is valid only when unquestionably true, then, at least in principle, it is impossible to prevent legal anarchy, since halakhic rulings cannot be objective. Any view able own times and justifies it in terms of the people's willingness or agreement to acknowledge authority. 52. Maimonides, introduction to Mishneh Torah. 53.

In the discussion of epistemic authority I argued that rulings forbidding disciples to dispute their teacher are not evidence of support for deontic authority, since they may rest on an assumption of the need for deference. Rulings concerning the forbidding sage, however, could serve to justify deontic authority. Whereas R. Nissim restricts this ruling to instances in which both courts are equal in wisdom, R. Abraham of Posquieres, whom R. Nissim quotes, offers a different view. R. Abraham, of blessed memory, wrote in his commentary on Avodah Zarah that . . . once it has been forbidden by the former [sage], a ban is imposed on it and it is no longer allowed, and even if the later [sage] allows it, it is not allowed . .. meaning that he [the latter] must not allow it, and if he does it is not allowed, even if he is greater in wisdom and numbers.54 R. Samson Raphael Hirsch accurately notes that R. Abraham and R. Nissim rely on different grounds for their rulings: "[According to R. Nissim, the reason is] the former's honor, and a later sage can therefore allow what a previous one had forbidden if he surpasses him in wisdom and numbers.""55 In other words, with all due respect to the sage's honor, a halakhic ruling is supposed to be correct. The sages' authority rests solely on their knowledge, and therefore wisdom overrides honor whenever they conflict. In contrast, R. Abraham and his supporters believe that the reason for this ruling is "not the former's honor, but the fact that a ban is imposed through his ruling, as long as he has not erred concerning a mishna or an extant ruling."''56 The key concept in this approach is "a ban is imposed on it." But what does this mean? How exactly does a rabbinic ruling ban an object? Halakhic literature offers two explanations, each one illuminating the deontic model from a different angle. One argues that it is in the sage's power "to impose a halakhic ruling on it as long as he does not err concerning a mishna."57 54. R. Nissim, Commentary on Avodah Zarah 7a. Man)y other sages support this stance. See, for instance, R. Shlomo b. Adret (Ha-Rashba) and R. Yom-Tov b. Abraham (Ha-Ritva) ad loc. The tosafists and R.

Israeli, Amnud Ha-Yemani (Jerusalem: Eretz Hemdah, 1992), p. 53.</page><page sequence="21">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 21 In other words, the ruling is valid because the sage is empowered to issue rulings, and his authority flows directly from the Torah: "as we are told in the Torah, 'judges and officers shalt thou make thee,' that the community must appoint judges and ensure that their words are heard."58 The second explanation, found in Peri Meggadim and quoted by R. Hirsch, suggests other grounds for the validity of rabbinic rulings. Because of the nidrei issur, which are from the Torah. . ... Whoever comes before a sage fit to rule on questions of issur ve-heter assumes an obligation to comply, in principle, with the judgment issued by the sage, as long as he does not err concerning a mishna. Their agreement turns this ruling, as it were, into the equivalent of a banned object. So it is with the people of Israel, who agreed to accept a sage as their rabbi and teacher, and thereby committed themselves to obey his rulings on any matter touching on the community, whether it concerns one or many.59 This view claims that the authority of the local sage rests on the consent of the individual or the community to accept his rulings. Both these explanations share the assumption that the sage's authority is not contingent on his knowledge and, therefore, his rulings cannot be challenged. They differ on the question of whether rabbinic authority flows from the Torah or, as Hirsch argues, from a nonlegal source; namely, a request for a rabbinic ruling implies a commitment to act in line with it. In sumfi, underlying the claim that a sage's rulings are endowed with absolute validity, even when another sage is greater in wisdom, is the assumption of a deontic model. Clearly then, this model rests on a religious ethos totally different from that assumed by the epistemic model. The epistemic model views all members of the community as bearing equal responsibility for studying and abiding by the Torah. In contrast, the deontic model assumes that responsibility for the Torah rests on the authorities, to whom members of the community must submit unconditionally, even to the extent of renouncing their own judgment if necessary. 58. Ibid. 59. Ibid.</page><page sequence="22">22 AVI SAGI On the Attempts to Reach a Balance I have so far discussed two ideal types of halakhic authority, bringing out the contrasts between their respective religious ethos. Despite these differences, however, a closer examination of these models reveals that they embody the two poles accounting for the dialectic character of the halakhic system. The epistemic model represents the centrality of the Torah in the halakhic realm. It is the Torah that bestows legitimacy on halakhic norms and authority on halakhic sages. All Israel have an equal share in the Torah, and, beyond their knowledge, authorities enjoy no special status. In contrast, the deontic model emphasizes the status of halakhic sages as the bearers of the Torah. This model reflects the practical needs of the Jewish collective-the need for uniformity as well as the religious-theological fact expressed in Nahmanides' formulation, "He gave me the Torah as taught by them [the sages]" (Deut. 17:10). Both these elements are necessary and constitutive of halakhah. Supporters of the deontic model must assume that the Jew's primary obligation is to the Torah; the duty of obedience incumbent on believers relates, first and foremost, to God and His Torah rather than to other people. In turn, supporters of the epistemic model must assume that a system of authority is required, even if only on practical grounds, because not every individual can be a halakhic expert. If the halakhic system is open to interpretation, rulings are necessary to prevent the one Torah from becoming several Torahs, even if "both are the words of the living God." Given the need for both these elements, it should not come as a surprise that many halakhic sages tried to create a balance between them. We shall consider these attempts in light of the two midrashim epitomizing the conflicting models of authority discussed in this article: on the one hand, "even if they point out to you that right is left and left is right," and on the other, "only if they tell you about right that it is right and about left that it is left." Attempts at harmonization also hint at a hierarchical relation between these two models, and several harmonization devices are discussed below. Distinguishing between subjects, namely, claiming that the deontic and epistemic models apply to different people. R. Issachar Baer Eylenburg, who endorses the epistemic model adopted by the Babylonian as well as the Jerusalem Talmud in Horayot, leaves room for deontic authority. He</page><page sequence="23">MODELS OF AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE 23 distinguishes between one who is absolutely certain and one who is only making an estimate or relying on his own view. And we should not question on the basis of what it says. "even if they point out to you that right is left and left is right, obey them," that this implies he is commanded to heed the sages even if he knows them to be wrong, contrary to the beraita I cited above, where we learned: "Is it possible that if they tell you .. ." That their saying in the Sifrei, "even if they point out to you that right is left," means that even if in your heart and according to your own reasoning you think they were mistaken ... but not if he knew for certain that they were wrong.60 This approach assumes that unconditional obedience is required only when a person is not absolutely certain regarding his own knowledge; however, concerning anything on which he has attained certainty he is forbidden to obey. Thus unconditional obedience reflects a factual state of affairs-lack of certainty-rather than an ideal situation; that is, unconditional obedience points to a an epistemic state rather than to an absolute obligation. R. Hayyim ibn Attar advances a similar argument: Concerning the rest of the people, if one has not studied and reasoned, then his knowledge is not knowledge, even if they tell him about left that seems to him right, and vice versa. . . . And if he has studied and reasoned and his knowledge is knowledge ... if they told him these things and he knew that it was forbidden to follow their ruling, he is liable if he heeded them.61 This view matches that of R. Eylenburg, who also draws a distinction between the subjects contingent on their knowledge. R. Eliezer of Mainz proposes another version of this approach when he claims that the deontic model only applies to the mufla shel beit-din ("distinguished expert").62 Rather than on the people as a whole, unconditional obedience is only incumbent on members of the court, preventing them from ruling against their colleagues' decisions and undermining the court's authority. 60.

The basis for distinguishing between different rulings has been discussed at length, and R. Hayyim Palache relies on one of these distinctions. And R. Kikar Ladan63 . . . wrote that the reference here is to those who are mistaken concerning an explicit ruling in the Torah. where everyone knows they are mistaken [and hence must not be heeded], whereas there [namely, in the Sifrei] they are not mistaken, they do know whether this is allowed or forbidden, and what they are doing is issuing a hora'at sha'ah [temporary provision], or dealing with matters not explicitly stated in the Torah on which they have ruled in line with their own understanding. They know what the Torah has allowed or forbidden and make no mistakes, so that he must heed them.64 Other ways of harmonizing the two models of authority have also been suggested. These two, however, suffice to clarify what is the preferred model of authority as well as the ideal to which a community member should aspire. In R. Hayyim ibn Attar's terms, a person need not remain in the status of one who "has not studied and reasoned" and can attain knowledge. In sum, I have pointed in this article to two models of halakhic authority, one epistemic, the other deontic. Although each presupposes a different hierarchical structure and a different religious ethos, an interesting dialectic relationship prevails between them. As both epitomize elements crucial in Jewish tradition-the value of Torah and the value of uniformity-it is natural that trends attempting to represent both patterns of authority have emerged in the course of Jewish history.
