<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Liberles. Salo Wittmayer Baron: Architect of Jewish History. New York: New York University Press, 1995. xiii, 425 pp. A measure of irony informs Robert Liberles's engaging and incisive biography of Salo Wittmayer Baron, the first professor of Jewish history in an American university. Liberles characterizes Baron as a pioneer in "building a place for Jewish history within the university world" (p. 357), but he was equally a transitional figure. Born and raised in Tarnow, educated at university in Vienna, Baron emigrated to the United States in 1926 to teach at the recently established Jewish Institute of Religion. Within three years he received his appointment to Columbia University's first endowed chair in Jewish history, religion, and institutions, located, somewhat to Baron's initial discomfiture, in the department of history. From this singular position for over thirty years, Baron taught a cadre of graduate students and encouraged the normalization of Jewish historical study. Both his students and his methodology eventually made his own approach to Jewish history irrelevant, specifically his devotion to writing a multivolume history of the Jews. Baron hoped to transcend his two towering predecessors: Heinrich Graetz, whose extraordinarily popular History of the Jews was translated into many languages, and Simon Dubnow, who achieved renown despite the relatively late publication of his World History of the Jews. Although Baron published the first edition of his The Social and Religious History of the Jews in 1937 when he was only forty, he is largely known today for a handful of influential essays. Indeed, I suspect that many younger scholars of Jewish religion and history are unfamiliar with Baron's work and do not recognize his name.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 149 How did it happen that one of the towering figures in Jewish American academia, a prolific scholar and communal activist, a revered teacher and influential historian, has so quickly been forgotten even as Jewish studies and Jewish history are flourishing in American universities? Liberles understand- ably does not make this the central question of his excellent study, nor is his intellectual biography an effort to rescue a neglected figure. Liberles began his research while Baron was still alive (he lived to the age of ninety-four) and his presence still felt; he completed it after Baron's death in 1989. Yet his account is sobering, for it suggests how pioneers or transitional figures can be eclipsed by the new world they help to produce. Baron succeeded in legitimating the social-historical study of Jews within the academy and provided a model of communal activism practiced by many American Jewish academics today. His success reveals both possibilities and limitations inherent in practicing Jewish history in the academy. Liberles interweaves Baron's biography with critical discussion of his intellectual heritage. Ironically, Liberles returns repeatedly to one of Baron's first essays, "Ghetto and Emancipation: Shall We Revise the Traditional View?" published in 1928 in the Menorah Journal, a Jewish intellectual and literary monthly. Here Baron answers his own question with a ringing affirmative, presenting interpretations of Jewish history that would guide his subsequent work. Liberles singles out Baron's influential attack on the lachrymose view of Jewish history, the notion that Jewish history comprises suffering and scholarship. Liberles also points to Baron's important challenge to the unrelievedly negative portrait of the Middle Ages as a period of "persecution and wretchedness" in contrast to the wildly optimistic image of emancipation as ushering in an era of "equality and opportunity" (p. 40). Baron revised both ends of this interpretation, arguing that the Middle Ages were not quite so bad for Jews, and their legal status not quite so debased, while the post-emancipation years contained substantial difficulties for Jews. The essay illustrates how Baron brought his scholarship to address issues relevant to a popular audience. Liberles's analysis places the essay in its intellectual and biographical context, including Baron's demanding negotiations with the Menorah Journal's editors, which reveal unpleasant aspects of his character. Baron, the man, appears to have been a rather cold fish to all except his circle of intimates. Liberles chooses, at times, to speak to his readers in the first person, expressing his own opinions as a biographer and as a contemporary Jewish historian, an American-educated, Israeli scholar.

Thus the volume gives us several voices, most notably Baron's and those of his contemporaries---as in the careful treatment of the process behind the fateful choice of Baron for the Columbia chair, but also Liberles's. His personal reflections add immediacy by insisting on the continuing relevance of such issues as whether a world-historical approach to Jews is appropriate as opposed to a comparative approach emphasizing local conditions. He invites us not merely to learn from Baron but also to engage the questions that he faced. As an American Jewish historian, I appreciated the attention Liberles gave to Baron's gradually growing interest in American Jews in the wake of the destruction of European Jewry. Baron increasingly saw American Jewish history as an ideal research site for his theories of the mutual influence of social and religious trends in Jewish history. Although America's voluntaristic Jewish community disturbed him, he came to recognize that an open society had some positive benefits. It is thus not ironic that the first chair in American Jewish history at an American university was established at Columbia by members of Baron's family.
