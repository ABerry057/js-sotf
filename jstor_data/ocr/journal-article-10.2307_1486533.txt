<plain_text><page sequence="1">Berel Lang. Heidegger s Silence. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996. 129 pp. Martin Heidegger, arguably the most important philosopher of the twen- tieth century, was a member of the Nazi Party until the last day of the Third Reich. In 1949, he wrote: "Agriculture is now a mechanical food industry, in essence the same as the manufacture of corpses in the gas chambers and extermination camps, the same as the blockade and starvation of the countryside, the same as the production of the hydrogen bombs" (quoted in Lang, p. 16). This is approximately all Heidegger had to say about the Holocaust after the war, when everybody knew everything, even if there were Germans who during the war were unaware of the full magnitude of the Nazi crimes. The case of Heidegger has generated a vast controversy in which every possible position is advanced, ranging from the view that he was a terrible philosopher and an even worse person, to the view that he was a great philosopher who made a relatively minor political mistake that in no way detracts from his philosophical standing. Lang's book deals with Heidegger and the "Jewish question." A whole chapter of the book is devoted to distinguishing between the Jewish question and the "Jewish question." Before the Holocaust, argues Lang, we can speak of the Jewish question without quotation marks because we are dealing with</page><page sequence="2">152 BOOK REVIEWS a real problem. After the Holocaust and the creation of the State of Israel, we may use the expression only with quotation marks. After the Holocaust, to raise the Jewish question without quotation marks is a moral offense because we now know the consequences of turning Jews into a problem. In addition, the State of Israel normalizes Jewish existence even for those Jews who choose not to emigrate there. They become like any group living in one country with ties to another. The Jewish question thus ceases to be unique and can only be referred to in quotation marks, signifying an alleged rather than a real problem. The question that permeates this book is: After the war, why did Heidegger remain silent about the Nazi crimes against the Jews? Did he not make matters worse by comparing the death camps to the mechanized food industry, as in the quotation above? More broadly, was Heidegger an antisemite? Lang argues, to the extent I understand him, that Heidegger did not raise the Jewish question before the war. Because of his belief in the metaphysical superiority of the German Volk, he had "little to say about those other 'peoples' for whom satisfying the requirement of a metaphysical 'essence' ... was in doubt" (p. 55). When he spoke of other nations, it was "in terms that only rehearse features more definitively present in the German Volk" (p. 55). Heidegger thus found it difficult to take metaphysical note of any nation other than Germans (with the exception of the ancient Greeks). His ignoring the Jews was just a part of his ignoring all non-Germans and becomes problematic only in retrospect, when his prewar policy of silence continued after the Holocaust. Heidegger's public silence on the Jewish question during the Nazi era is not an insignificant fact. There is a handful of private letters with passing antisemitic comments but nothing similar in anything he published before or during the Nazi era. Given the depth of the Nazi obsession with Jews as the poisoners of Western civilization and the Jewish spirit as the eternal enemy of the German spirit, had I been Gauleiter of Freiburg, I would have worried about this philosopher claiming to be a Nazi who did not publish a bad word about the Jews. This is particularly puzzling in the light of Heidegger's German metaphysical chauvinism. To see the superiority of the German spirit in every respect--particularly the metaphysical one--and not to see the satanic evil of its opposite, the Jewish spirit, is a grave defect for a Nazi philosopher. Why did Heidegger suffer from this defect? I think it had to do with his Christian problem. He started his career as a Christian thinker, but the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 153 Christian dimension soon disappeared from his thought. In Being and Time, there is much talk about anxiety but almost nothing about love. God is replaced by being that is as much nonbeing as being. With being eroded by nonbeing and eternity by temporality, anxiety and being-to-death rather than love and forgiveness become the metaphysical coin of the realm. Heidegger has come a long way from his Christianity. He has become a Nazi philosopher. But his break with Christianity, I think, was not clean. It was never explicit; there is no anti-Christian polemic. He recognized, I surmise, that to attack the Jewish spirit is to attack the spirit of Jesus and the New Testament, and this he was not willing to do. So we remain with a Nazi philosopher who would not attack the Jews during the Nazi period and could not face up to the magnitude of Nazi crimes against the Jews after they became known to the whole world. By equating the Holocaust with mechanized agriculture he made himself a metaphysical, moral, and religious laughing-stock. Lang's book is a thought-provoking meditation on a deeply embarrassing episode in the history of Western thought. Michael Wyschogrod University of Houston Houston, Tex.</page></plain_text>
