This note, which aims to help clarify the issue, is a response to Steven Fraade's essay, "Rabbinic Polysemy and Pluralism Revisited: Between Praxis and Thematization," published in this journal.1 Surveys of the history of the polys emy debates are readily available;2 my present concern is with Fraade's position, and the positions to which he is responding, chief among them Daniel Boyarin's claim that rabbinic polysemy is a relatively late, post-tannaitic, phenomenon.3 Fraade sets out to refute this claim, and his essay provides a dozen passages that serve as "countertexts to [Boyarin's] arguments" (5). The aim of this response is to show that the rabbinic sources in question are not countertexts, and that polys emy is, in fact, a post-tannaitic phenomenon. My critique of "Rabbinic Polysemy and Pluralism Revisited," runs along two main axes: one, which constitutes the core of this essay, involves Fraade's interpretations of the rabbinic sources; a second focuses on the concepts he employs. To his credit, Fraade is aware of the need "to differentiate among some of the modern terms of discussion that are so often conflated," (3) and sets forth admirably clear definitions of what he intends. Nonetheless, I believe there remains significant imprecision, not in the definitions themselves, but rather in their relevance to the question of tannaitic polysemy. The problem is already adumbrated in the essay's titular juxtaposition of polysemy and pluralism, the latter defined as "the claim that the rabbinic sages ... promoted—even cele brated—an ideology and intellectual culture that encouraged ... rabbinic groups or individuals to 'agree to disagree' and to 'teach the controversy' when it could not be resolved" (4). Without detracting from the significance of this topic, it should be emphasized that it has no direct bearing on the question of the tannaitic understanding of the biblical text. Polysemy concerns the variety Steven Fraade read an earlier version of this paper. Despite substantive disagreement on the interpretation of the tannaitic sources, his response was helpful and generous. Editors' note: Steven Fraade's response to the current essay will appear in AJS Review 38:2. 1. 1.

A commitment to "agree to disagree" or preserve contradictory legal traditions,4 in contrast, is not necessarily linked with any view of the biblical text. Indeed, many of the most celebrated pluralistic (in Fraade's sense) rabbinic passages refer to the preservation of incommensurable oral traditions—for example, the well-known discussions in B. cEruvin 13b ("these and these are the words of the living God") and B. Hagigah 3b ("they are given from one shepherd")—and do not make a claim regarding the nature of Scripture, polysemic or otherwise.5 The above issue is exacerbated by the article's definition of polysemy as "the claim that a canonical text contains or can legitimately yield multiple mean ings" (3). But this is not the concept of polysemy operative in Border Lines, where Boyarin speaks of the "theological principle of the undecidability of the divine language,"6 nor, for that matter, in David Stern's work, where polysemy means that "every verse has several meanings."7 Fraade's definition misses the key point that polysemy (as defined in the scholarship he sets out to refute) is an inherent characteristic of divine language, and arguably denudes the concept of its analytic force. After all, many texts are held to "legitimately yield multiple meanings" without being considered polysemic: the Supreme Court's interpret ation of the Constitution results in majority and minority opinions—a single docu ment yielding two opposite but legitimate interpretations—with no attendant doctrine of the inherently undecidable nature of the English of the Founding Fathers. So while it is significant that the early rabbis allowed different interpret ations to stand side by side, this phenomenon is far removed from any theologi cally anchored scriptural polysemy. As for the rabbinic texts, of the thirteen sources Fraade discusses, I discount two (texts 5 and 10) as they are not "drawn from the earliest stratum of rabbinic literature" (5), but rather from amoraic or later strata—Midrash Tehillim, and the Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, respectively.8 Fraade includes them because they cite tannaitic figures, but to identify citation with composition ignores the overwhelming evidence that later rabbinic sources regularly reworked earlier strata, and sometimes invented "traditions" whole cloth 4. This is the meaning of "legal pluralism" in rabbinic scholarship. In legal studies this phrase refers to the existence of multiple legal systems within a single geographic framework. 5. Fraade acknowledges that "[RJabbinic disagreement as to the ritual purity status of an object (tame?(tame? or tahor) need not necessarily derive from differences of scriptural interpretation and may just as well be based on differences of logical argumentation or received tradition without direct reference to scripture" (3-4), but throughout the essay he yokes pluralism and polysemy together. 6.

Fraade groups the remaining tannaitic texts into three categories, which I address in turn.11 I have reproduced the most thoroughly discussed texts (3, 4, 6, 7, 12, and 13) in an appendix. A. The Textual Practice of Polysemy and Multivocality This section consists of two Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael passages. Text 1 is legal,12 describing the procedure attending a slave's decision to remain with his master even after the seventh-year release: "He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life" (Exodus 21:6). The Mekhilta passage consists of a number of elements: a "you might say ... or perhaps it is merely ..." (אתה אומר... או אינו אלא) argument that concludes that Scripture refers to the right ear; a dispute between Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Meir as to the precise location of the piercing (earlobe or cartilage?); a brief midrash identifying the ear as the locus of punishment because it heard God's commands at Sinai;13 and a contrast between the scriptural language (awl) and what "Halakhah says" (any instrument). Fraade makes a number of closely packed comments about the passage. The Mekhilta's "preferred understanding is provided first, only to be followed by alternative understandings" (9); the contrast between Scripture and Halakhah is "a bold statement" of the fact that "the rabbinically determined practice may depart from the plain meaning of divinely revealed Scripture" (9); the passage exemplifies the way in which "the various opinions are not simply listed but are editorially given voices and joined in implicit dialogue with one another" (9-10). The Mekhilta's practice of introducing interpretations that it then goes on to reject is not polysemy, but rather its opposite: There is a correct interpretation, but the Mekhilta rhetorically foregrounds an incorrect one, in order to make explicit the interpretive path not taken. The Mekhilta's contrast between extra-scriptural tradition (Halakhah) and the biblical precept is attested in numerous passages in the Mishnah and Tosefta that contrast halakhot and Scripture. Some of the best known examples are M. cOrlah 3:9's division: "The new produce is prohibited by the Torah throughout, the fruit of young trees (corlah) by Halakhah, and crossbred kinds (kila 'yim) by the words of the scribes"; M. Hagigah 1:8's charac terization of the laws of the Sabbath, the festal offerings, and sacrilege, as 9. See, e.g., the inventions of Elisha ben Abuya's apostasy, as discussed by Alon Goshen Gottstein, The Sinner and the Amnesiac: The Rabbinic Invention of Elisha ben Abuya and Eleazar ben ben Arach (Stanford, CA.: Stanford University Press, 2000), and of Rabbi Akiva's youth, Azzan Yadin, "Rabbi Akiva's Youth," Jewish Quarterly Review 100 (2010): 573-597. 10.

Nezikin 2, to Exodus 21:6 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 253). 13. Though Fraade does not comment on this, the midrash is obscure, citing Exodus 20:15 ("You shall not steal") as the relevant prooftext. See Horovitz's comments, ad loc.. 131</page><page sequence="4">AzzanAzzan Yadin-Israel "mountains that hang on a hair, for they have few biblical verses and many hala khot"; and the dispute in T. Sukkah, "the willow ritual is an extra-scriptural tra dition (halakhah) given to Moses at Sinai. Abba Shaul says: It is from the Torah..." (T. Sukkah 3:2).14 Finally, recording different legal opinions does not constitute polysemy; it is an inclusive editorial practice that recognizes the empiri calcal existence of controverting views, and chooses to record them. It does not reflect a theological commitment to the inherent plurality of meaning in God's word. Text 2 is an aggadic passage from the Mekhilta consisting of two interpret ations of the phrase "house of bondage" (Exodus 20:2), separated by the phrase davardavar 'aher.15 Fraade claims this as an example of the tannaitic tendency to set "multiple interpretations and legal opinions not simply alongside one another but in rhetorical dialogue ..." (11), and contrasts this approach with other corpora such as the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Dead Sea Scrolls, whose editorial practices tend toward univocality. But the derashah in question does not produce such a dialogue since davar 'aher marks the juxtaposed interpretations as distinct, editorially demarcated, statements. B. Early Rabbinic Thematization of Legal Multivocality The first two texts in this section, texts 3 and 4 (reproduced in the appendix), are drawn from Sifre Deuteronomy pis. 48. The first is a short midrash on Proverbs 27:7, which likens a Torah scholar to a sieve: "Just as a sieve separates flour, bran, and meal, similarly [a disciple] sits and sorts words of Torah and weighs them: so-and-so permits, so-and-so prohibits, so-and-so declares impure, so-and-so declares pure." The second links Amos 8:12 ("They shall wander about seeking the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it") with a person traveling from city to city to find the answer to an obscure legal question—corresponding to Amos's wandering in search of the word of the Lord.16 Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai then asks whether the prophet foretells the forgetting of the Torah ("the word of the Lord") and, having shown that Deuteronomy 31:21 forecloses this possibility, glosses forgetting as a situation in which "so-and-so prohibits, so-and-so permits, so-and-so declares impure, so-and-so declares pure, and one cannot find a clear rule." In keeping with his thesis, Fraade finds here a valori zation of the opposing legal positions, since all of the contradictory opinions "are to be preserved through the dual process of sorting and memorizing 14. This is an outstanding example of the non-scriptural nature of rulings described as "Hala khah to Moses from Sinai." See the discussion in Christine Hayes,"Halakhah leMoshe mi-Sinai in Rab binic Sources: A Methodological Case Study," in The Synoptic Problem in Rabbinic Literature, ed. Shaye J. D. Cohen (Providence, R.I: Brown Judaic Studies, 2000), 61-117, and especially pages 66-77. Other passages that distinguish between Halakhah and Torah (or midrash) include T. cEruvin 8:23, 8:24; T. Hagigah 1:9; M. Nedarim 4:3; T. Berakhot 2:12; T. Sotah 7:21; and T. Sanhedrin 7:7. 15. Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, par. Ba-hodesh 5 to Exodus 20:2 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, 222), and see Fraade's textual discussion at 10 n. 24. 16. This part has nothing to do with multiple opinions: the man in question simply travels ("wanders") to find an answer to his question. 132</page><page sequence="5">Rabbinic Polysemy through repetition," such that "the halakhic tradition need not be stripped of its multivocality" (14). I do not see how these sources support Fraade,s conclusion. Text 3 states that the disciple must sort, sieve-like, through the teachings he has received, in Shlomo Naeh,s words, "classifying mixed materials—an activity without which the Torah he has acquired is not fit for use, like flour that requires sifting."17 In other words, the disciple has heard various traditions and now must sift through them and order them so as to make them suited for legal discussion. It is not clear what the disciple is to do with the teachings that are trapped, as it were, in the sieve. The Sifre does not elaborate, and its silence on this point is significant, since this is the heart of the matter from a legal-pluralist perspective. If they are discarded, the passage is out right anti-pluralist. But even if they are to be preserved, the resulting pluralism is weak: it acknowledges the existence of opposing traditions, but does not valorize this reality in any way. Text 4, in Fraade,s own words, "problematizes this prolifer ation of rabbinic teachings..."—nota bene, it problematizes this pluralism; it does not celebrate it. Despite that, Fraade tries to salvage a polysemic position by char acterizing the Sifre's problematization as undertaken "... specifically in terms of memory5' (14), with the sorting activity functioning as a guarantor of the teach ings'ings' preservation for later generations. This is, in a sense, true, but the derashah's estimation of this state of affairs is significantly different than Fraade suggests. It is not the case that Shimon bar Yohai positions Amos 8:12 ("they shall not find the word of the Lord") and Deuteronomy 31:21 ("It will not be forgotten from the mouth of their offspring") as two contradictory views whose resolution is that, in his words, "the sorting and (repeated) recitation of the conflicting opinions will ensure that they are remembered" (14). Rather, the forgetting of the Torah is introduced as a possible but ultimately untenable interpretation of Amos 8:12 (since it contradicts Deuteronomy 31:32), only to be replaced by the correct interpretation. According to the Sifre, then, "They shall not find [the word of the Lord]" means that they will not find a single, authoritative legal position• because "so-and-so prohibits, so-and-so permits, so-and-so declares impure, so-and-so declares pure." The passage, in other words, is not advocating the preservation of contradictory legal views (which, to repeat, would not constitute pluralism or polysemy in any case), but lamenting a state of affairs in which the proliferation of such views impedes a definitive and unambiguous legal ruling, equating it with Amos,s dire prophecy that "they shall not find the word of the Lord."18 17. Shlomo Naeh, "The Craft of Memory and Structures of the Text," (Hebrew) in Mehkerei talmudtalmud (Talmud Studies Dedicated to the Memory of Professor Ephraim E. Urbach), ed. Yaakov Sussman and David Rosenthal (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2005), 3:564. 18. Note that while these derashot thematize the multiplicity of legal positions insofar as they set this as the theme of their discussion, they do not "thematize" in Fraade's sense of endorsing or theo logically justifying this multiplicity. The same holds true of the quote from Jerome at 14-15 n. 39, who calls upon the reader to recognize the existence of various opinions, but then reach a decision in favor of one and against the other and, "like a good banker, reject the money from a spurious mint." 133</page><page sequence="6">AzzanAzzan Yadin-Israel Fraade discusses texts 6 and 7 (reproduced in the appendix) jointly, though they are concerned with different matters. Tosefita cEduyot 1:1 (text 6) explains the ordering of the oral testimonies as a rabbinic response to an imminent situation in which "a person will go looking for a teaching from the words of Torah and will not find it, from the words of scribes and will not find it." Mishnah 0Eduyot 1:4-6 (text 7) asks, "Why do they record the words of Shammai and Hillel for naught?"19 and "Why do they record the words of an individual among (those of) the majority, whereas the Halakhah may only be according to the words of the majority?" The Mishnah answers the first question with a call for jurisprudential humility ("to teach future generations that a person should not persist in his argument"), the second with two incommensurable answers: one anonymous, that the minority view is preserved as a precedent for a future ruling, another, attributed to Rabbi Judah, so that future legists know to discount that position. Text 6 is not apposite, as it merely justifies the organization of Halakhot by tradent ("what is of the House of Shammai and what is of the House of Hillel?"), as opposed to the thematic structure that prevails in other Mishnah and Tosefta trac tates. Fraade argues that the preservation of the traditions of both Hillel and Shammai (likely a synecdoche for irreconcilable rabbinic views) shows that the editorial process involved "collecting and ordering the conflicting rulings ... without stripping them of their multivocality" (19). However, multivocality is not a characteristic of individual rulings, and so it cannot be stripped from them. Multivocality inheres to a collection of rulings that preserves many pos itions—and even then only in a weak editorial sense that has long been recognized as a hallmark of rabbinic literature. Tosefta cEduyot recognizes the prima facie oddness of preserving both legal positions, such that the relative openness of the tannaitic sources stands out against the backdrop of, say, the Dead Sea Scrolls. But for an investigation of "talmudic" polysemy in tannaitic sources, the operative comparison is to the Babylonian Talmud, and here the contrast is stark. In the anonymous stratum of the Bavli, the conflicting views of the Houses of Hillel and Shammai give rise to a clear statement of the multivocality of received traditions: "These and these are the words of the living God" (B. cEruvin 13b). Not so the Mishnah, which eschews theological justification for this practice. Text 7 does not deal with polysemy in any sense, and is problematic for the claim of legal pluralism. Its question "why do they record the words of the individual among (those of) the majority for naught?" is driven by the view, expli citly stated, that the minority's position is wrong, the majority's right. To be sure, the Mishnah is playing a sophisticated game here. The anonymous (majority) view is that today's minority position may be tomorrow's majority ruling (M. cEduyot 1:5); while Rabbi Judah's (minority) position is that the minority view is preserved 19.1 have departed from Fraade's translation here. He renders לבטלן "(only) for them to be nul lifted," understanding the nun as an accusative suffix—לבטל אותן. I think it is preferable on syntactic grounds to read the nun as an adverbial suffix corresponding to the nunation in Arabic and mimation in Biblical Hebrew, analogous to להלן and לקמן. My argument in unaltered on Fraade's translation. 134</page><page sequence="7">Rabbinic Polysemy so that future tradents of this view not gain unwarranted currency. As Moshe Hal bertal has written, "The editor thus created a kind of circular paradox: according to the majority view, minority opinions were mentioned in the Mishnah so that they could be revived in the future; whereas in the eyes of the minority, minority opinions were mentioned so they could be rejected forever."20 All the same, both the anonymous view and Rabbi Judah hold that there is a right and a wrong position, differing only on whether the two might be reversed at a future time. The fundamental orientation is non-pluralistic: the conflicting views do not merit preservation in their own right. It is only the theoretical possibility that in some future time the rejected position will find favor that justifies its preservation. C. The Multivocality of Revelation In the final section of his essay, Fraade argues that the Sinai theophany was a site of polysemic revelation. Text 9, from the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael,21 describes the voices at Sinai allowing "each person to hear them according to his capacity" (לפי כחו), suggesting a multivocality embedded in the theophany. But hearing "according to one's capacity" has nothing to do with divine polysemy, and everything to do with the varying cognitive abilities of the auditors. As Richard Hidary notes, "this midrash does not necessarily reflect multiple conflict ing interpretations but rather deeper or more superficial understandings of the single message of the voice."22 But even this may be more than the text allows. For as Fraade notes, the "midrashic passage is attentive to the plural forms of 'thunderings' and iightenings' in the sound and light show that accompanied rev elation at Mt. Sinai" since "the Hebrew word employed for 'thunderings' (kolot) can also mean 'voices'..." (24).23 Fraade's reading is attentive to the nuances of the biblical text—identifying the plural kolot as the trigger for the plural understand ings the Mekhilta attributes to the Israelites—and his analysis is subtle and convin cing. But it also works against his broader argument. For the Mekhilta is not making the polysemic claim that a single divine voice spoke at Sinai but produced many meanings, but rather that there were plural voices from the outset—kolot and not kol. Text 11, from Sifre Deuteronomy,24 states that for each word God spoke at Sinai "Israel would observe it and would know how much midrash could be derived from it, how many laws (halakhot) could be derived from it, how many 20.

As with the previous passage, Fraade offers a penetrating interpretation of the passage. "The Israelites are able to discern the plenitude of meanings that will one day be derived from each divine utterance through rabbinic ... hermeneutical methods of exegesis. Although those methods ... are expressed in plural forms, there is is no no suggestion here that they are in discord with one another or arise in the context context of debate" (27; emphasis added). Fraade nonetheless counterposes this passage to Boyarin,s claim that it is only in the Talmud that we find "thematized and theorized for the first time the theological principle ... that the divine language produces manifold and different meanings."25 But the Sifre Deuteronomy passage is not concerned with plurality of meaning, but rather with bridging, indeed effa cing, the historical chasm stretching from revelation to belated rabbinic interpret ation. It asserts, in Fraade's words, that rabbinic conclusions were already visible "at the originary moment of divine utterance and human reception" (27). It is not, then, the plurality of rabbinic positions here addressed, but rather the gap between the biblical word and the later rabbinic interpretation. Text 12 (see appendix), also from Sifre Deuteronomy,26 interprets Deuteron omy 33:2 as a series of statements describing the Sinai theophany, each associated with another language: "The Lord came [בא] from Sinai" with Hebrew; "and dawned from Seir upon us" with "Roman"; "he shone forth [הופיע] from Mount Paran" with Arabic; and "he approached [אתה] from Rivevot-Kodesh" with Aramaic. Taken together, the verses teach that God's revelation to Israel was "not just in one language" but in four. The precise meaning of this derashah is elusive. As Fraade acknowledges "[i]t is unclear here whether the four languages were uttered/heard simultaneously or in succession." This is a critical issue, since if the statements are made in succession, the midrash is not polysemic. Not surpris ingly, Fraade suggests the four utterances were heard simultaneously, on the basis of two considerations. One is the subsequent interpretation—introduced by davar 'aher'aher—that explains the fourfold statement in geographic terms: God,s revelation was "not just from one direction ... but from four directions, with Sinai, Seir, and Paran constituting three, and a fourth introduced by Habakkuk 3:3, 'God comes from Teman.'" Another is that "[t]his is clearly the understanding in the later tra dition of God's speech having 'split' into seventy languages at Sinai" (31 n. 101). The latter is inadmissible on logical grounds. All scholars agree that polysemy is attested in post-tannaitic strata; Fraade claims to show that this is also the case for the tannaitic sources. Invoking continuity between earlier and later traditions to justify a polysemic reading of Sifre Deuteronomy pis. 343 is nothing more than petitio principii (i.e., begging the question). Fraade is asserting the very 25.25. Boyarin, Border Lines, 189-190, quoted in "Rabbinic Polysemy and Pluralism Revisited," 27-28. 26. Sifre Deuteronomy, Vezo t ha-berakhah, pis. 343 to Deuteronomy 33:2 (ed.

The analogy between the two derashot is also untenable but on different grounds. If the second (geographic) derashah speaks to the simultaneity of the first (four languages), it reflects the view of the editor who juxtaposed the two, not the meaning of the first text. But even this is not the case, since the editor marks the difference between the two by interposing the phrase davar 'aher between them. As noted above, this phrase indicates that the editors understand the derashot to be substantively distinct. And finally, because the two derashot differ in a critical respect: the first understands Sinai, Seir, Paran, and Rivevot Kodesh to be synonyms—four reports of the same event framed in different terms. In the second, Sinai, Seir, Paran and (imported from Habakkuk) Teman are different locations, so that each stich of the verse refers to a discrete geographic aspect of revelation. The simultaneity of the distinct geographic locations speaks to the geographic—not linguistic—scope of God's revelation, and therefore cannot be blithely transferred to the neighboring derashah. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the Sifre Deuteronomy understands the four languages to have been spoken simultaneously. What exactly does this teach us? Less, I fear, than Fraade would have us believe. For one thing, the tetraglossic revelation consists of four enunciations of the same statement, not four disparate and incommensurable divine dicta—so this is not "another articulation of the rabbinic conception of the multivocality of divine rev elation" (31). Though speaking four statements at the same time is wondrous {if that is what the Sifre in fact describes), a four-fold enunciation of the same content in different languages is not polysemy, but rather polyglossia. Fraade tries to circumvent this difficulty by asserting that, while polyglossia and polys emy are not identical "to the extent that they are both associated with divine speech and its immediate human reception, they are complementary expressions of revelatory multivocality" (29 n. 93). But this is a conceptual error. Any state ment, whether divine or human, can, in classic translation theory, find expression in—that is, be translated into—many languages, without thereby denoting or even connoting polysemy. Moreover, the derashah is responding to the four stiches of Deuteronomy 33:2: "The Lord came from Sinai, and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran, and approached from Rivevot-Kodesh." The invocation of four languages (not polysemic in any case) is an exegetical attempt to account for a perceived redundancy in one verse, not a statement of principle about the nature of divine speech or of the biblical text, as such.27 27. This last issue also bears on Fraade's critique of my argument in "Hammer on the Rock": "I should note that the two examples from the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael ... that Yadin cites in his attempt to deny polysemy to the midrashim attributed to Rabbi Ishmael appear to support such an idea: 'The Holy One, blessed be He, speaks two things/commandments (devarim) in a single utterance (dibbur)"'(dibbur)"' (28 n. 91). But as I stated explicitly in the article, the Mekhilta uses the image of the hammer creating multiple sparks "to explain a unique crux in the Bible" (Yadin, "Hammer on the Rock," 13), namely the two reports of the Sabbath commandment in Exodus and Deuteronomy. "Remember (zakhor) the Sabbath day, and keep it holy" in Exodus 20:8, versus "Observe (shamor) the Sabbath 137</page><page sequence="10">AzzanAzzan Yadin-Israel Fraade's last example, text 13 (reproduced in the appendix), is the Tosefta's discussion of the phrase "masters of assemblies" (בעלי אסופות) which occurs in Ecclesiastes 12:11: "The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the masters of the assemblies, given by one shepherd." This source, Fraade notes, is "central to Boyarin's denial of any rabbinic thematization of polysemy and pluralism prior to the post-amoraic stratum of the Babylonian Talmud" (31). Here the key issue is the passage's later reworking in the Babylo nian Talmud. In the Tosefta, the masters of the assemblies "enter and sit in multiple assemblies, declaring what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure..." The Talmud's masters of the assemblies, in contrast, are disciples of the sages who sit in assembly where "these forbid and those permit; these declare impure and those declare pure; these declare unfit and those declare fit" (b. Hagigah 3b). Shlomo Naeh has offered a subtle philological analysis of the two passages, arguing that the Tosefta is concerned with legal monovocality and needs to justify the preservation in memory of the earlier controversies of Hillel and Shammai, for example. The Talmud, in contrast, lionizes legal controversy among the sages.28 Boyarin, for his part, has incorporated Naeh's insights into a broader pattern of Babylonian revisions of earlier traditions that he locates in the anonymous stam. Fraade does not engage this line of argument, however, as his "focus, by contrast, will be on T. Sotah 7:11-12 in its own right and not in the shadow of B. Hagigah 3b" (31 n. 102). But that is precisely Boyarin's point, as I understand it: without "the shadow of the Bavli," no one would think that the Tosefta was addressing the question of polysemy. As noted, the first scene offers a nostalgic picture of the masters of the assemblies "declaring what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure." The second warns of the danger of legal controversy: "lest a person think to himself, 'Since the House of Shammai declares impure and the House of Hillel declares pure, so-and-so prohibits and so-and-so permits, why should I henceforth learn Torah?"' After a brief and implacably obscure derashah (perhaps to Deuteronomy 1:1), the passage addresses a hypothetical student who despairs of Torah study due to the current plurality of legal positions, allaying his concerns with the claim that "All the[se] words were given by one shepherd. One God created them, one ben efactor [Moses] gave them...." The Tosefta passage concludes with an exhortation day and keep it holy" in Deuteronomy 5:12. This is a much stronger example for Fraade's argument than the same statement in four languages, but as I showed there, "[i]t is not, by any means, a statement about the polysemic nature of the biblical text as such. Indeed, it suggests an underlying non-polysemic understanding of the Torah, since in a thoroughgoing polysemic context the dual speech of the Fourth Commandment spoken at Sinai could be held up as a particular instance of the general principle (Yadin, "Hammer on the Rock," 13-14), but is not. 28. Shlomo Naeh, "A Heart of Many Rooms: On the Rabbinic Approach to Controversies in Halakhic Literature," in Renewing Jewish Commitment: The Work and nought of David Hartman, ed. Avi Sagi and Zvi Zohar (Jerusalem: Shalom Hartman Institute and Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 2001), 851-875. 138</page><page sequence="11">Rabbinic Polysemy to preserve in memory the words of both Hillel and Shammai, "the words of those who declare impure and the words of those who declare pure." Fraade offers a relatively lengthy analysis of the passage and concludes that "the multivocality of the 'words of sages/Torah' is originary and not belated to divine revelation," since "[a]// the words of the sages, whether in consensus or dis sensus, were ultimately created, given, and uttered by a single God and human intermediary" (36). True enough, and text 13 may well represent the closest thing to polysemy in the tannaitic corpus. But even here, Fraade's conclusion glosses over significant issues. First, the Tosefta by no means celebrates this state of affairs. To the contrary, the existence of different legal positions is a problem problem that could drive people away from Torah study. Second, the Tosefta con trasts the reality of conflicting legal views with the (idealized) halakhic uniformity of days gone by, in which the masters of the assemblies would sit in judgment "declaring what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure." This is a critical point: under ideal circumstances halakhic decisions should be decided by a monovocal, legal realist approach—things that are (in reality) pure, should be declared pure, and things that are (in reality) impure, should be declared impure. The legal landscape, however, has changed, and the Tosefta must acknowledge that different schools espouse different positions. The identifi cation of a single divine source for "all the[se] words" is a postlapsarian conces sion to the contemporary reality of competing legal positions. The Tosefta can only implore the reader to preserve both sides of halakhic controversies, and thus keep the divergent views from being lost to future generations. Grudging legal pluralism is the last recourse against the potentially deleterious effect of halakhic discord on future Torah students. How far this is from a principled affir mation of the inherent polysemy of God's word, and from the robust legal plural ism of sages who "promoted—even celebrated—an ideology and intellectual culture that encouraged ... rabbinic groups or individuals to 'agree to disagree' and to 'teach the controversy' when it could not be resolved" (4). * * * Having carefully examined the material Fraade has marshaled in support of tannai tic polysemy, I conclude that if Fraade's careful analysis of the tannaitic sources has failed to provide a clear example of polysemy or of valorized legal pluralism, it is because these are not to be found until a significantly later stratum of the rab binic corpus.

Text 4: Behold it says, "They shall wander about seeking the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it5' [Amos 8:12], Our sages permitted going from city to city and from province to province to determine whether an insect that comes into contact with a loaf of bread renders it impure in the first or second degree. Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai says: Does this [verse] come to say that the Torah will be forgotten in Israel? But has it not been said, "It will not be forgotten from the mouth of their offspring" [Deuteronomy 31:21]? Rather, so-and-so prohibits, so-and-so permits, so-and-so declares impure, so-and so declares pure, and one cannot find a clear rule [davar barur\ Text 6: When sages came together in the vineyard at Yavneh, they said: The time is coming in which a person will go looking for a teaching from the words of Torah and will not find it, from the words of scribes and will not find it, since it is said, "The time is surely coming, declares the Lord God, when I will send a famine on the land; not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord. They shall wander from sea to sea and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it"it" [Amos 8:11-12], The word of the Lord׳, this is prophecy; the word of the Lord:Lord: this is [knowledge of] the end; the word of the Lord: this is one who seeks a teaching from the words of Torah that is similar to [that of] its fellow ... They said: Let us begin with what is of the House of Shammai and what is of the House of Hillel. Text 7: And why do they record the words [rulings] of Shammai and Hillel [only] for them to be nullified? To teach future generations that a person should not persist in his word, for behold the fathers of the world did not persist in their words. And why do they record the words of the individual among [those of] the majority, whereas the Halakhah may only be according to the words of the majority? For if a [later] court approves the words of the individual it may rely upon it. For a court cannot nullify the words of another court unless it exceeds it both in wisdom and in number; if it exceeds it in wisdom but not in number, or in number but not in wisdom, it cannot nullify its ruling; but only if it exceeds it both in wisdom and in number. Rabbi Judah said: If so, why do they record the words of the individual among [those of] the majority [only] for them to be nullified? For if a person shall say, "I have received such a tradition," they shall say to him, "You heard [only] according to the words of so-and-so." 140</page><page sequence="13">Rabbinic Polysemy Text 12: Another interpretation: "He said: The Lord came from Sinai": When the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself in order to give the Torah to Israel, not just in one language did he reveal Himself to them but in four languages, [as it is said,] He said: The Lord came from Sinai: this is the Hebrew language. He He shone upon them from Seir: this is the Roman language. He appeared from Mount Mount Par an: this is the Arabic language. And approached from Ribeboth Kodesh:Kodesh: this is the Aramaic language. Another interpretation: He said: The Lord came from Sinai־. [When the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself in order to give the Torah to Israel, not just from one direction did he reveal Himself but from four directions, as it is said, "He said: The Lord came from Sinai; He shone upon them from Seir; He appeared from Mount Paran."] And what is the fourth direction? "God comes from Teman" [Habakkuk[Habakkuk 3:3], Text 13: Masters Masters of assemblies: [This refers to] those who enter and sit in multiple assemblies, declaring what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure; what is impure [to be] in its place, and what is pure [to be] in its place. But lest a person think to himself, "Since the House of Shammai declares impure and the House of Hillel declares pure, so-and-so prohibits and so-and-so permits, why should I henceforth learn Torah?" Scripture teaches, "words," "the words," "these are the words." All of the[se] words "were given by one shepherd." One God created them, one benefactor [Moses] gave them, the master of all deeds, blessed be He, spoke it.
