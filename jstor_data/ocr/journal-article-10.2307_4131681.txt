Meaning in Spinoza 's Method. Cambridge: Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 2003. xii, 240 pp. Both books under review reconsider Spinoza's importance for philosophy and Jewish thought. Though only one of them, Steven Smith's, makes a direct claim that Spinoza's work is intrinsically Jewish-Smith calls the Ethics "a 454</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews profoundly Jewish book" (29)-both draw freely on Jewish sources to understand particular passages in the Ethics, and both see Spinoza's philosophy (not just his commentary on religion and the Bible in the Theologico-Political Treatise) as at least partly in conversation with the traditions from which he was officially exiled at the age of twenty-three. Smith's book, Spinoza's Book of Life: Freedom and Redemption in the Ethics, is most overt in this regard. Taking its title and epigraphs from three Jewish sources-the entreaty Jews make to God during Rosh Hashanah to "inscribe us in the Book of Life," an allusion to this entreaty in a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer, and a brief quote from Franz Rosenzweig ("Into Life")- Smith begins with the claim that the Ethics is Spinoza's own book of life: a text not only of moral philosophy but, recalling another great Jewish figure with whom Spinoza is often compared, "a guide of the perplexed to people in all times" (30). The Jewish allusions seem at first to be deployed mostly as markers of Smith's own shift from intending to write a book on "the influence of Spinoza on Jewish thought and political theory" to actually writing one on, loosely speaking, the influence of Jewish thought and political theory on Spinoza (xi). To Smith, it seems that the Ethics is, above all, a "reply to the author of Genesis," one that reverberates down to the present (xv). If the Ethics has sometimes been seen as a classic of the now long-dead rationalism, it is Smith's purpose to show that, in its confrontation with "the ancient quarrel between reason and faith" (xv), Spinoza's very rationalism gives us resources for "a reconsideration of orthodoxy" and tradition (xvi)-and thus, one might assume, a reconsideration of reason and rationalism themselves. Together with his claim in Chapter 1 that the Ethics is a "profoundly Jewish book," the reader expects a project of major rethinking. What Smith has written, however, is essentially an introduction to the Ethics for readers who may have some familiarity with Spinoza but are puzzled- perplexed-by some of his stranger ideas: that the mind is the idea of the body, for example, or that human beings are free even if all things have a cause. As a broadly conceived account of Spinoza's theory of freedom, Smith's book largely succeeds. In a series of chapters that progress, as the Ethics does, from God and human thought to desire, politics, and love, Smith is at his strongest when he is resisting what he thinks of as long-standing prejudices about Spinoza: that Spinoza has no concept of (or interest in) particularity, that he has nothing but contempt for the imagination, that his focus on the body entails reduc- tive materialism, and that politics is only a sideline to what is truly important in philosophy. The Ethics, Smith usefully reminds us, is a book of and about life (28), which can be understood as all that is bountiful, abundant, desirous, trou- bling, and of course, complicated and difficult. It is not a book about lifting oneself above life's vicissitudes but about "celebrating" them and thus immersing oneself more fully and more adequately in them (4). Smith periodically offers the reader stronger interpretations amid his more general explanations, suggesting, for example, that Spinoza's "new philosophy" is "described in explicitly erotic terms" (159) or that the last line of the Ethics ("all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare") "confirms" that Spinoza's 455</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews "idea of perfection, the rational love of God, is extremely private, not to say utterly solitary" (182). But he does not provide enough evidence for these claims. They clearly square, on one hand, with Smith's Plato-inspired reading of Spinoza's "thinking about love" (154, the title of Chap. 6)-specifically, the image borrowed from the Symposium for what Smith names Spinoza's "ladder of love" (161), with its connection between Eros and the ascent toward the (privileged, solitary) truth. But elsewhere, Smith's reading is at odds with the notion that the end to which Spinoza would have us strive is "private" or "solitary," stressing that Spinoza's notion of freedom is a "positive" one, focused on both "the pleasures of indivi- duality" and "the companionship of others" (149-50). Because Smith states his thesis in at least three different ways-as discovering the political nature of the Ethics; as connecting the Ethics to the "Shema ['Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One']" and its biblical worldview (18); and as casting the Ethics as a text that, above all, "brings to light the ancient quarrel between reason and faith, philosophy and revelation" (xv), not to mention connecting Spinoza to Maimonides, Rosenzweig, and Singer-it is hard to know at any given moment which of these aims or figures (if any) is driving Smith's reading. But the oddest thing about Spinoza's Book of Life is its self-image as a Jewish reading. The problem is twofold. First, the claim about the Ethics' Jewish- ness, like the claim that it is an erotic book or one that recommends the solitary life, is really just a provocative observation. There is a sustained argument in Chapter 2 ("Thinking about God") that Spinoza's God is in intimate dialogue with the God of the Bible, whom, according to Smith, Spinoza aims to replace with "nature as a vast causal network without will or purpose" (35). But if this counts as a Jewish reading, then virtually every reading of the Ethics since it was published posthumously in 1677 could be regarded as one (which, I add, does not make the reading a good one). Can it be any more illuminating from a Jewish standpoint to quote Singer's "Spinoza of Market Street" in a discussion of the meaning of passionate love in Spinoza? Smith contends that Singer, like Spinoza, had a particular appreciation for the ways in which "passionate love may also be empowering" (167). But he provides no insight into how this might advance our understanding of the Jewishness of Spinoza's point. It is not clear whom Smith is trying to convince and exactly of what. Second, and more confusing, is Smith's conclusion to the book in the final chapter, titled "The Authority of Reason." It is only here, arguably, that one can make out a convergence among the many threads of the book: its claims about Jewishness, its concern with the God of the Bible and of orthodoxy, its fore- grounding of politics, and its interest in the confrontation of faith and reason. One finds, in sum, the long shadow of Leo Strauss, with whom Smith wrestled in his first book, Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity (Yale University Press, 1997) and whom he proves unable to dislodge here as well. The Ethics, Smith holds, is preeminently a "refutation of orthodoxy," and the ques- tion that he begins the conclusion to his book with is whether it is "successful or if it is ultimately built on a castle of sand" (184). In response, Smith takes the reader on an excursus through the so-called pantheism controversy, the eighteenth- century debate between F. H. Jacobi and Gotthold Lessing that focused on 456</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews interpretations of Spinoza, before turning to Strauss. The point seems to be that both Jacobi and Strauss share the conviction that Spinoza's most profound achievement was his (attempted) break with orthodoxy. For Jacobi, this rationalist (atheist) break concludes merely that human beings cannot be free, a conclusion that enables Jacobi to argue for the impoverishment of reason itself. Strauss concurs with Jacobi's notion that reason and faith are "incommensurabl[e] in their premises" (196), arguing that Spinoza finally could not prove that everything in nature is "susceptible to a rational explanation" because rationality, at the most fundamental level, cannot account for itself, for the "leap of faith" that reason itself presupposes (197). In other words, there is no more evidence that the world is inherently rational than that it is not, a fatal blow not to orthodoxy, which "assumes that" moral order "rests on a decision whose origin is in the will," but to philosophy, which, in Smith's reading of Strauss, is "compromised, perhaps fatally, by this awareness" (197). Smith appears to side with Strauss in this worry, namely, that reason- because it is blind to its own partiality-might be unable to prevent "a world of competing orthodoxies ... each engaged in a life and death struggle for recognition and power" (198). On the other hand, Strauss seems to be brought in at the end of Spinoza 's Book of Life to offer up precisely the opposite conclusion: that "the conflict between faith and reason" can also function to ameliorate this compe- tition. For it is precisely, says Smith, the tension between reason and faith, their incommensurability, that enables us "to think through this conflict by taking seriously one side of the tension and thus bringing us to the brink of the other" (199). It is only by doing so-by keeping faith with Strauss's belief that "no one can be both a philosopher and a theologian"-that one can resist "the fanati- cism and obscurantism" that is the result (on this logic) of being ignorant of their intrinsic conflict. Yet in the end, Smith is equivocal about whether he thinks Strauss's reading of Spinoza's rationalism is right or not and, if not, whether Spinoza's "reconsidera- tion of orthodoxy" is equally, then, a reconsideration of (Straussian) reason. In the final, very brief section of the book, he appears to hedge his bets, commending Spinoza for his views on democracy, the free individual, and the fortitude to confront the "human situation," regardless of whether this "probity founders on the shoals of its own rationalism, as Jacobi and Strauss later maintained" (200). I would have thought, though, that the "authority of reason" (or lack thereof) and the shoals of rationalism were precisely the pseudoproblems a book such as Spinoza 's Book of Life could have dispelled. Why grant to Strauss the terms of the debate between faith and reason? Would it not have been more consistent with Smith's own thoughtful appreciation for Spinoza's dynamic conception of reason to argue that it makes no sense (in Spinoza) to pit reason and faith against one another-that it is this very conception of reason purged of faith (and thus, for Spinoza, purged of embodied practice) that Spinoza laments from the beginning to the end of the Ethics, that he rules out with his concept of scientia intuitiva or the identity of mind and body or the role of the affects in knowledge or the conatus as desire "into life," as Rosenzweig put it. In short, that in Spinoza there is reason without rationalism, commitment without 457</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews confession (orthodoxy), and thus that Spinoza has already thought circles around Strauss, not to mention Jacobi, before they even launch their critiques. At the very least, the recourse to Strauss provides Smith one last reason for the attribution of Jewishness to the Spinozan project-the Jewishness of a neo-Maimonidean who is ultimately unable to decide between the book of life and the book of the mind. Fortunately, we have Spinoza's Ethics (and, at times, Smith's own commentary on it) to show us exactly why we need not-why we cannot-choose between these. Aaron Garrett's Meaning in Spinoza's Method is a close reading of the Ethics that seeks to establish, as the title suggests, that the geometric form of the work performs a purpose beyond simply the achievement of intellectual clarity. Using concepts and terminology from Spinoza's earlier work, the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, Garrett contends that Spinoza's use of the geo- metrical form-the mos geometricus-acts to "emend" the person reading it, "ridding [us] of inadequate ideas so that those adequate ideas that already make up our minds can be better expressed" (17). As he puts it even more strongly, the "basic point" is that "Spinoza's philosophy is a kind of self-clarifying therapy for those capable of self-clarification; that this self-clarification arises not just from reflection but also from other sorts of knowing; and finally that the choice of the method by which to establish appropriate knowledge and the vehicle or means by which to present it, as a consequence, is absolutely central" (7). In so arguing, Garrett places himself in dialogue with some relative heavyweights in the history of the study of Spinoza: Harry Wolfson, who argues that the geometrical form of Spinoza's thought is unconnected to its sub- stance, and Martial Gueroult (and his successor Alexandre Matheron), whose work places the method "at center stage" (17). Where Garrett moves Gueroult's arguments further, he claims, is in his insistence that this method is not just con- nected with the meaning of the ideas that Spinoza relates but with the condition of his reader. To understand Spinoza, Garrett claims, is also to "discove[r] and augment[t] ... those very powers always already in the human mind and body" (18). In short, to read Spinoza well is, borrowing from Nietzsche, "to become what you are" (18). This thesis draws on a standard reading of Spinoza. As Smith also notes, Spinoza's work "has often been seen as a kind of therapy for the soul in which our emotional life is actively transformed, transformed by being understood" (111). Garrett wants to make this transformation contingent on the geometrical method, but the idea that Spinoza is trying to emend his readers' minds is some- thing Spinoza makes clear throughout his works (is this not true of any good work of philosophy?). Garrett's sense, though, is that it is worth concentrating on Spi- noza's version of this claim to get at the particular relationship Spinoza conceives between ignorance and knowledge. As Garrett stresses several times throughout the book, for Spinoza, we are in search of truths (and abilities) of which we are neither fully ignorant nor fully in possession. As the foregoing quotation makes clear, the point for Spinoza is "to discover and augment" the powers we always already have, and for this tricky task, the geometric method--with its aspect of both training and building-is especially well suited. 458</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews The strongest version of the thesis-that the geometric method is absolutely necessary to expressing Spinoza's argument in the Ethics-will not be persuasive to many readers who are familiar with the book (which is perfectly ungeometric in many of its longer passages, prefaces, and appendices). The method is incredibly useful, and certainly one cannot imagine the Ethics without it, but this hardly seems different from saying that one can not imagine Hegel's Phenomenology without its particular form. Despite the book's title, though, the strong version does not seem to be Garrett's point. For Garrett, the point about knowledge is much more important, and here, the image he uses-which he tells us in the acknowledgements he wanted to use as the book's title but was warned off by an editor who was concerned about marketing-is "a worm in the blood." Taken from a letter that Spinoza wrote to Henry Oldenburg in 1665, the image is of a worm "living in the blood," able to distinguish "the particles of the blood, of lymph, of chyle, and the like, and capable of observing by reason how each particle" works (epigraph). We are like this worm, says Spinoza, able to see what is before us with exactitude but unable to connect this with the larger wholes (the whole system of blood, the operations of the body as a whole) of which these particles are mere parts. We know, in other words, but our knowledge is often inadequate, or, as Garrett puts it, we are "overawed by external causes, ignorant of the bodies that impact [our] bodies, yet thoroughly dependent on them also" (46). It is this human quagmire, according to Garrett, that most interests Spinoza and that moves him to develop an epistemology in which power, as much as cognition, is the animating term. Along the way, Garrett decided to make the book also about method in order to better understand the "puzzle" of Spinoza's third kind of knowledge (scientia intuitiva) and his definitions (16), which many commentators have puzzled over, including primarily the questions (again in Garrett's language) "where they come from and what they are for" (144). This move takes readers deep into the heart of some of the most technically complicated ideas in Spinoza's thought. But the additional set of inquiries seems to bog Garrett down somewhat, as he struggles to make his way through "some central themes in Spinoza's Ethics" (the subtitle of Chap. 1), "a few further basic concepts" (the title of Chap. 2), the ideas of the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect (Chap. 3), chapters on method alone and definitions (Chaps. 4 and 6), a chapter on Maimonides and Ger- sonides (Chap. 5), and a chapter on the third kind of knowledge (Chap. 6). Garrett does manage to sustain his focus on method throughout this immense amount of material, but he tends to lose the worm imagery and, with it, the investigation into that rich phrase with which he begins: "to discover and augment ... those very powers always already in the human mind and body." Indeed, the method angle seems to turn the book into an investigation of Spinoza's overall project. (The first sentence of the book reads, "This is a book about Spinoza, one of the greatest philosophers of the seventeenth century, or of any time.") Whether this is because Garrett simply felt he had to present this much of the thought to make the method point stick or because the method point is just not as focused, as fecund, as it needed to be. 459</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews As a "book about Spinoza," Garrett would have been better off taking Smith's breezier tone and less ponderous attachment to the minutia of the argu- ments. The interesting digressions on Maimonides and Gersonides seem packed into a book that is already full and designed to place Spinoza in a "Jewish philosophical line" without much explanation as to why this is important (134). As a technical book on Spinoza's method and theory of knowledge- which is really what this book is-it could have stood a more ruthless (and not just market-savvy) editor. There is no real conclusion to the book as a whole. The analysis tends to be risk-averse, careful, and deferential to a fault. The level of technicality will strain the patience of all but the most devoted Spinoza lovers. Yet Garrett himself is clearly such a lover of Spinoza, and much of that enthusiasm comes through. He is right that "Spinoza is not interested in the force or power of ideas as such" but only "in how these ideas are important for human minds," in how ideas, as Spinoza puts it, "lead us, by the hand as it were, to the knowledge of the human Mind and its highest blessedness" (142). Garrett's is a fine account of many of the most fascinating details of why and how this is so. Nancy Levene Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana</page></plain_text>
