<plain_text><page sequence="1">424 BOOK REVIEWS Sharona Wachs. American Jewish Liturgies: A Bibliography of American Jewish Liturgy from the Establishment of the Press in the Colonies Through 1925. Bibliographica Judaica 14. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1997. ix, 221 pp. The field of Jewish liturgy is usually tended by scholars of Bible, rabbinics, literature, history, theology, anthropology, or linguistics, and rarely by anyone exclusively devoted to the phenomenon of liturgy. As a result, liturgical texts usually end up serving as handmaid to other academic disciplines. Moreover, when one speaks of Jewish liturgy, one generally has in mind textual and musical phenomena of Europe and the Middle East, and then what constitutes the statutory prayers of the synagogue. Now a volume has appeared that manages to focus exclusively upon liturgical texts (and their musical settings), specifically those of the United States. To say, albeit with complete accuracy, that this volume will greatly facilitate the study of both liturgy and of Jewry in the United States is to understate its contribution as well as its delight, for what is found within will also serve to broaden popular understanding of liturgy. At the outset a complaint must be made, and that is that the title of this book is annoyingly misleading and just plain wrong. The contents are limited to materials published in the United States; the subtitle hints at the provenance of the materials listed herein but still does not correct this glaring error. (I, for one, was eager to see materials from the Caribbean and South America, not to mention Canada.) The subtitle does, however, let the reader know that there is a cut-off point, and I can only hope that Wachs is hard at work on the post-1925 materials, as well as on those other American liturgies. What is in this book is a listing of all the liturgical materials published in the United States beginning with that initial, delectable entry, "The Form of the prayer which was performed at the Jews' synagogue in the city of New York, on Thursday October 23, 1760: being the date appointed by proclamation for a general Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the reducing of Canada to His Majesty's dominions." The reader (yes, I found myself reading this entertaining book) then goes on to discover all kinds of musical scores, private devotional literature (particularly for women and girls, often--but not always--ranslated from European tehinnot), synagogue dedication cere- monies, hymnals, memorial services for notable individuals (#131: "Service and sermon held on the day of lamentation: June 1st 1865, in memory of our late beloved President Abraham Lincoln . .."), children's prayerbooks and textbooks, confirmation handbooks, not to mention a treasure trove of siddurim</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 425 and mahzorim, psalters, s'lihot---the usual cast of liturgical characters. The bibliography is arranged chronologically, so one can easily trace the liturgical development among the Jews of this country from the timid few offerings of the late eighteenth century to the veritable explosion in the mid-nineteenth; from the urban centers of the eastern seaboard to the towns of the south, back north again, to the mid-west and the far west; from the Sephardic communities to the German to the Polish; from the publications of prominent, individual rabbis to those of major institutions. The two introductory essays, by Karla Goldman and Eric L. Friedland respectively, on just these chronological matters give the reader free-sample-sized tastes (that is, tasty but tiny) of what a scholar can do with this material. If one does not wish to proceed chronologically, the indices enable a topical, geographical, name, or title search. Who would have guessed Evansville, Indiana, to be a hotbed of liturgical publishing (#160 being the earliest entry; "Der israelitische Confirmand" from 1868)? There is the promise of such entries as "Prayer at the Opening of the House of Representatives" (#88; 1860; p. 216 in the misnamed "liturgical" index-why not "subject"?) and "Paducah, Kentucky" (Geographical index, p. 171). And one can discover that Hours of Devotion: A book ofprayers and meditations for the use of the daughters of Israel, during public service and at home for all the conditions of woman's life went through thirteen printings (p. 195 in the title index)--and that does not include the numerous reprintings of the German edition! Such index-delights help one overlook the uselessness of index entries that can go on for more than six and one-half inches (for example, the entry "Reform Rite" in the liturgical index). Occasional errors also mar the indices (#65 does not appear in any way to be correctly indexed under "Tehinnot," for example); and some entries are "lost" under the botched placement of the topical heading "Musical Services" (p. 216 in the liturgical index), which certainly should not, but does, include the entry "Prayer Books for the Deaf." These kinds of errors, easily overlooked in a conventional text, are counterproductive in a bibliography, detracting in this case from a work which is otherwise well-organized, with a clear and concise format. Yet the total strengths of this volume result in an outstanding contribution to the study of liturgical texts, music, and contexts, as well as to the study of United States Jewry.
