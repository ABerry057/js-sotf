<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Adele Berlin. Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative. Sheffield: Almond Press, 1983. The datedness of Berlin's Poetics is belied by the relative belatedness of this review. The subsequent appearance (in English) of Meir Sternberg's The Poetics of Biblical Narrative, which far more thoroughly and deeply delin- eates a structural poetics of the Bible, would make virtually any prior treat- ment seem elementary and superfluous for the serious reader. Our growing sophistication concerning questions of academic presupposition and metho- dology also affects our reading of Berlin, leaving this reader, at least, with a more negative impression than one might have earlier had. The book is of interest, however, precisely because it directly confronts issues of theory and practice in the analysis of biblical narrative. Like many other critical readers, Berlin displays far keener awareness of the other person's theoreti- cal assumptions than of her own; and the manner in which she attempts to critique contrary positions is rather typical of academic discourse, at least in the field of biblical studies. Before proceeding to discuss the philosophical matters that interest us, however, let us summarize the program of Berlin's book. Berlin endeavors to begin writing a "poetics" of biblical narrative. Working within the assorted conventions of New Criticism, Russian semio- tics, and Western structuralism, she seeks to describe "how [the Hebrew Bible] tells its stories" (p. 15). She maintains that she can compose a descriptive poetics of biblical narrative before entering into the interpreta- tion of the text. Poetics, the "science of literature," analyzes the way that literature functions, just as linguistics analyzes a language (ibid.). A linguist, however, cannot write a grammar without first understanding, i.e., inter- preting, the object language. For this reason, Berlin's analogy fails and crucially spoils her enterprise. She had wanted to assert the priority of "poetics" over any other form of analysis by isolating it altogether from the notoriously subjective act of interpretation (cf. the critique by Joel Rosen- 279</page><page sequence="2">280 BOOK REVIEWS berg in Prooftexts 5 [1985]: 287-295). To appreciate the significance of her error, consider the analogy she goes on to make. Literature is like a cake, poetics is the recipe for the cake, and the interpretation tells how the cake tastes. This set of analogies suffers a number of difficulties. First, literature, by Berlin's own definition, is a semiotic product; a cake is not. The recipe is followed by the author, while tasting is done by the reader. Berlin, however, urges the reader to study the recipe (i.e., narrative poetics) in order to do better tasting (i.e., interpreting). This does not follow at all. Were the analogy to hold, the cake should not have any taste until the consumer has learned the recipe! Berlin tries to have her cake and eat it, too. Realizing later (pp. 16-17) that to "induce" the poetic conventions from the texts themselves involves a measure of interpretation, she cites the structural poeticist T. Todorov on the "complementarity" of poetics and inter- pretation. Berlin develops her poetics chiefly in two areas, the means by which characterization is achieved, and the manipulation of narratival point of view. The three types of characters Berlin identifies in biblical narrative, the story of David in particular, follow from her readings, thus undermining her earlier claim that poetics precedes interpretation. Her notions of point of view in biblical narrative derive directly and explicitly from general literary theory, thereby countervening her purported effort to induce the narrative conventions directly from the texts. The chapter on character is rich in exegetical insight, and the chapter on point of view reveals a highly complex system. It is in the latter chapter that professional biblicists will likely learn most, as Berlin opens our eyes to often subtle indications of diverse perspec- tives within a narrative. A chapter on poetics in the Book of Ruth is meant to apply the poetics outlined in the preceding chapters. In fact, it more often introduces further areas of narratological study, such as the uses of names and epithets and the analysis of plot structure. Berlin's Poetics might have ended there, but she has a larger agenda. She, like Robert Alter and certain other literary critics of the Bible, wants to use synchronic, poetic analysis in order to dispute the arguments and con- clusions of historical, i.e., diachronic, analysis. For example, Berlin, at the end of her chapter on Ruth, observes that many narratives only draw to a close with a "coda" that "takes the audience out of the time frame of the story and brings them back to real time" (p. 107). Although she only adduces two other story types as evidence, she confidently concludes that</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 281 "we are dealing here with a universal poetic principle." Because the geneal- ogy at the end of Ruth places the foregoing story in the narrative sequence from Genesis through Kings, Berlin makes the historical contention that the genealogy is not only apt but original to the book (pp. 109-110). In her chapter on poetic interpretation and historical-critical methods, and in many passages preceding it, Berlin argues for the priority of poetic over historical anaylsis. The contradictions that pervade her argument, however, reveal that her argument is little more than a tissue of presupposi- tions. Her major thesis is that synchronic, poetic analysis has a critical role to play in biblical studies by acting as a check on historical analysis. ". .. at the very least," she writes (p. 112), "it can prevent historical-criticism from mistaking as proof of earlier sources those features which can be better explained as compositional or rhetorical features of the present text" (emphasis added). The apparent inconsistencies in the episode of the sale of Joseph in Genesis 37, for example, may result from narratival shifts in point of view rather than from the interweaving of different sources. That is what Berlin demonstrates, and if that were all she claimed, she might be right. But she claims much more than that. She contends that the poetic explanation of diverse perspectives within the narrative must take precedence over any his- torical explanation. She hypostatizes what she has contended is a possibility into what must be the case. Berlin would have come to recognize this faulty reasoning had she paid more careful attention to her own cautions. In her discussion of the psychology of art and narrative interpretation in her final chapter, she notes that it is in the nature of perception that "we see what we expect to see" (p. 136). With regard to academic analysis, she observes that "proponents of each methodology seem to end up proving the assumption with which they began" (p. 112). More disarming, she acknow- ledges that "those who view the text as a unity find textual support for their view .... Synchronic literary approaches view the present text as a unity" (ibid.). Berlin is saying here that those who take the synchronic, poeticist approach begin with the prior assumption that the text is unified. As a parti- san of the poeticist position, Berlin will predictably find a synchronic explanation "better" than a historical one. Yet she appears unconscious of this evident bias. Consider the following statement: It has been noticed by many scholars that the problem with traditional source criticism is that it begins with the assumption that the text is composed of a</page><page sequence="4">282 BOOK REVIEWS number of sources, and then proceeds to find them. Methodologically speak- ing, it is more correct [emphasis added] to begin with the text, and find sources only if a careful reading so indicates. (p. 116) After acknowledging that both synchronic and diachronic methodolo- gies begin with theoretical presuppositions, Berlin here axiomatically posits the proposition that the synchronic viewpoint, which regards the unified text as a given, is "more correct" than the diachronic one. She further states: "... it remains a methodological question whether, having explained a piece of evidence synchronically, we can then use the same piece of evidence for a diachronic reconstruction" (pp. 125-126). Although Berlin is trying to maintain theoretical neutrality by speaking of "a methodological question" as though there were a universally accepted, "objective" methodology, she is clearly biasing the case in favor of her synchronic propensity. A historical critic might well reverse Berlin's statement by asking whether one could legitimately consider a synchronic explanation once one had in hand a diachronic one. In opposing the source critical analysis of Genesis 37 by D. B. Redford, Berlin presents her own "poetic" exegesis. She attempts to camouflage her synchronic bias by claiming to allow the text to "speak for itself" (p. 117). But in the very next sentence she writes: "I will present here my reading of the text . . ." That is indeed what she does and does well. The ingenuity as well as the occasional idiosyncrasy of Berlin's reading shows quite clearly that the text has no mouth and does not speak. It has been made to speak by a ventriloquist-a sensitive and insightful reader. Edward L. Greenstein Jewish Theological Seminary of America New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
