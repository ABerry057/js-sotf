<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gilbert Dahan. Les intellectuels chre'tiens et les Juifs au moyen dge. Paris: Les Editions du Cerf, 1990. 637 pp. Jewish scholarship, like so much else in Jewish affairs, tends to be dominated by the two largest centers of Jewish life in the late twentieth cen- tury, the State of Israel and North America. The central role played by these two major communities should not, however, obscure the existence and vitality of a number of smaller enclaves of Jewish scholarship. One of the oldest and most productive of these smaller enclaves is found in France. A rich nineteenth and early-twentieth-century tradition of Jewish scholarship in France was of course disrupted by World War II. In the aftermath of the war, a small cadre of scholars reemerged, led by the imposing figures of Georges Vajda and Bernhard Blumenkranz. While both of these outstand- ing figures have passed away, the students whom they trained have main- tained and expanded their legacy, through the Soci6t6 des Etudes Juives and its important review, through the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scienti- fique and a number of the universities, and-most of all-through a steady stream of valuable publications. The present volume is one of the significant fruits of this vital French scholarship. Gilbert Dahan has been known to students of medieval Jewish history for some time now, through his editions of important texts and through his insightful studies. The present volume represents a broad statement on the issues that have formed the core of his scholarly concern, the relationship of medieval western Christendom-in particular its intelligentsia-to Judaism and the Jews. Dahan makes clear from the outset his embeddedness in the tradition of French scholarship. On the second page of his introduction, he presents his study as, in effect, a continuation of the magisterial investiga- tions of Marcel Simon's Verus Israel and Blumenkranz's Juifs et chre'tiens dans le monde occidental. Indeed, Dahan chooses as his starting point pre- cisely the events of 1096, which marked the end of the Blumenkranz study,</page><page sequence="2">306 BOOK REVIEWS setting the time span of his investigation as the twelfth through the four- teenth century. The goal which Dahan has set for himself is formidable; I would argue that it has been met with great success. Les intellectuels chre'- tiens et les juifs seems to me destined to take its place as a major work of synthesis, along the lines of the Simon and Blumenkranz volumes. The structuring of the study is comprehensive. The heart of the volume lies in parts 3, 4, and 5, investigations respectively of the encounters between Christian intelligentsia and Jews, the confrontations between the same, and some summary statements on medieval Christian intellectuals and Judaism. In order to set these three sections in their proper context, Dahan provides two prior parts, the first devoted to the social, political, and legal setting of Jewish life in medieval western Christendom and the second to the church and the Jews. Here again, the scholarly community out of which and for which Dahan writes is significant. An author from either Israel or North America would, in all likelihood, have dispensed with the first two parts of the book, leaning on syntheses readily available to his reading audience. I am not at all suggesting that Dahan's efforts in providing such a synthesis were wasted. To the contrary, his overview is elegant and useful. Careful readers will inevitably find points of disagreement. However, the overall quality of the synthetic presentation is, in my view, excellent. The focus of the study, its concluding three sections, is rooted in Dahan's extensive knowledge of the writings of the medieval Christian intel- ligentsia. There is a rich, almost lush quality to the presentation, replete with considerable quotation from texts well known and little known. In his intro- duction, Dahan makes something of an apology for what he fears some might find excessive use of citations. This reader at least was profoundly grateful for his constant recourse to the sources. While the three-part scheme used by Dahan makes sense, there is clearly considerable asymmetry among the three central sections of the book. The richest section, mirroring the medieval reality, is that devoted to the con- frontative elements in the relationship of the Christian intelligentsia and the Jews. It is here that Dahan finds the fullest source material, and it is here that his analysis is the most textured. The closing section is somewhat disap- pointing. In effect, Dahan argues that medieval Christian intellectuals were not inclined to think abstractly about Judaism and the Jews, and the lack of such material creates a thinness to the closing section of the book. The study of more positive encounters between Christian intellectuals and the Jews occupies a median position, sparser and shorter than the analysis of con-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 307 frontation but thicker and more nuanced than the closing discussion of theoretical approaches. Dahan's insistence on balancing the confrontative aspects of the Christian-Jewish engagement against the more positive and neutral elements in that encounter seems to me salutary. From the begin- ning of the study, he insists on this balance, in a way that is reasonable and illuminating. To some extent, however, he has been forced to extend some- what the parameters of the positive or at least neutral encounter. For exam- ple, to include the Hebrew learning of the late-thirteenth-century mission- izers in the discussion seems to me problematic. For the missionizers the goal of amassing knowledge of the Hebrew language and of Jewish sources was only to advance the conversionist enterprise, hardly a positive or neu- tral approach to Judaism and the Jews. While all three central sections are useful, it is Dahan's study of the Christian-Jewish confrontation that is richest and most enlightening. Dahan approaches the extant materials from a number of points of view, all legitimate and valuable. In major chapters, Dahan discusses perceptively a number of literary formats in which anti-Jewish and anti-Judaic sentiments are expressed, the styles of argumentation utilized by Christian thinkers against Judaism, and some of the major themes of anti-Jewish polemic. His presentation now affords the fullest available resource for anyone interested in investigating these issues. To be sure, the range and complexity of these matters mean that no single presentation will cover all issues totally or in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. Thus, for example, Dahan-it seems to me-has not emphasized sufficiently the variety of functions played by some of the anti-Jewish materials that he discusses. In particular, he might have emphasized more heavily the purely defensive character of much of this material. I am not suggesting that there was no body of Christian literature aimed at actually converting the Jews; there surely was. I feel, however, that he has not sufficiently distinguished between such writing and the older and more standard Contra Judaeos literature, which was very heavily aimed at reinforcing the Christian beliefs of Christian readers and auditors. Along these same lines of functional analysis, I found his treatment of the Paris and Barcelona disputations somewhat disappointing. These are but minor quib- bles, however, and should by no means obscure the overall value of this richest section of the book. It is striking to me that this book, which was completed in 1986 but did not appear until late 1990, missed thereby a number of important publica- tions that touch in significant ways on Dahan's themes. Put in other terms,</page><page sequence="4">308 BOOK REVIEWS the rate of publication in this area is quite rapid, a development that should be of considerable satisfaction to those of us in the field. Among the many publications addressing themselves to the circumstances of the Jews in medieval western Christendom and, more particularly, to the stance of the Christian majority toward the Jewish minority, Dahan's Les intellectuels chritiens et lesjuifs will surely occupy a position of significance for decades to come. It is a treasure trove of materials and insights that will surely be mined regularly by researchers and general readers. I wish to note in partic- ular the latter group. One of the virtues of the book is the charm with which it is written. The pleasures of Dahan's delightful prose will undoubtedly expand the range of those who will dip into the riches which he has amassed.
