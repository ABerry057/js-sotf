<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lance J. Sussman. Isaac Leeser and the Making of American Judaism. American Jewish Civilization Series. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1995. 311 pp. An early historian of the American Jewish experience once wrote, "the history of American Judaism and that of Isaac Leeser are one and the same." In this thoroughly researched and meticulously detailed biography of a nineteenth-century "hazzan," Lance Sussman reinforces the credibility of that statement. Though Leeser is little known in the late twentieth century and barely mentioned in the literature of American Jewish history, he had an important influence on American Judaism. Indeed, Sussman convincingly argues that Isaac Leeser was the most outstanding religious leader in the United States prior to the Civil War. Leeser's extensive publications, including the monthly Occident and American Jewish Advocate (1843-69), the first successful Jewish serial periodical in America, helped mold American Jewry into a culturally independent group with a communal consciousness. He also did many other things to promote unity and communal responsibility among Jews, including advocating a national ecclesiastical organization as early as 1841,</page><page sequence="2">140 BOOK REVIEWS participating in the founding of the first Jewish defense organization in the United States, the Board of Delegates of American Israelites (1859), and promoting the B'nai B'rith later in his life. In Philadelphia, where Leeser lived during most of his active career, he was among the first to recognize the need for eleemosynary institutions, such as Jewish hospitals, orphanages, and federations of charitable institutions. He played a critical role in the creation of the Jewish Sunday school (1838), the first Hebrew "high school" (1849), and the first American Jewish theological seminary, Maimonides College (1867). The untimely collapse of the college after Leeser's death does not diminish the significance of his accomplishment here. Maimonides College established the basic model for the education of rabbis in the United States, and many of its supporters subsequently helped found the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (1886). In religious life, Leeser played a major role in transforming the informal, traditional office of hazzan into an American Jewish ministry based on the Protestant model, and helped set the groundwork of the modem rabbinate in the United States. Through his preaching and the publication of his sermons and those of other leading religious leaders in America and Europe, Leeser, nearly single-handedly, established the sermon as a basic feature of the synagogue service in America. And in an age when Reform Judaism was beginning to find fertile soil in the United States, Leeser served as the leading spokesman for Orthodoxy. He wanted to help construct an Americanized, or "Protestantized," version of Orthodoxy, with emphasis on English and decorum in services, and education for women as well as men. As Sussman makes clear throughout, Leeser, though frustrated in his attempts to "reform" Orthodoxy and stem the growth of Reform Judaism, remained optimistic that in the free atmosphere of America, a new Orthodoxy would arise. Leeser "had no patience whatsoever for the reformers and was increasingly frustrated by the traditionalists, especially those who were unwilling to change any aspect of their synagogues but failed to live within the borders of Halachah outside of their houses of worship. 'One party,' Leeser wrote in May 1850, 'called out, "Touch not the sacred edifice!" The other exclaimed, "Pull down the rotten fabric." We honestly dissent from both opinions,' he added. If Judaism were truly 'reformed,' Leeser believed, it would become a decorous, modem, unified, and vibrant Orthodoxy" (p. 162), one that would unify the vast majority of American Jews.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 141 But the Orthodoxy he championed, although relatively modem compared to its Eastern European variant, was strictly traditional, as Leeser's sermons, writings, and arguments with Isaac Mayer Wise, the leading reformer of the day, demonstrate. "We believe in common with all orthodox Jews in the literal fulfillment of Scriptures," Leeser was wont to reiterate. In an open, democratic, and vastly Christian America, Leeser's hope for unity under religious Orthodoxy seems naive, though Sussman stops short of taking this position. Leeser's Americanized Orthodoxy failed to unify American Jewry, and it failed to survive the nineteenth century, not because it was overwhelmed after 1881 by an Orthodoxy primarily fashioned in Eastern Europe, but because it could not attract an American constituency. Still, Leeser's contributions to a thriving American Jewish press, to Jewish educational institutions, and to the defense of the rights of Jews in the United States and around the world, were central to, and representative of, the early history of the Jewish people in America. Even his never-ending struggles with his Philadelphia congregation, Mikveh Israel, were, and con- tinue to be, representative of the relationship between Jewish communities and their spiritual leaders. There are a number of weaknesses in the book. No doubt the paucity of evidence has something to do with the fact that we never get to know Leeser all that well. It is refreshing that Sussman has not overindulged here in psychological speculation, but we hunger to know more about the person whose books were commercial failures, who was often brusque and difficult in relationships, who suffered a broken heart and never married, whose younger brother died, whose struggle with smallpox as a young man left him "physically and emotionally scarred for the rest of his life" (p. 74). The book is also somewhat repetitious. Unnecessarily long quotations appear with annoying frequency, and several are repeated, at least in part, more than once. Sussman also unfortunately relies on textbook rather than monograph material for American context, and much of that material is pedestrian and outdated. The reader is also distracted by too many unilluminating textual references to what other historians have said about one point or another. More editing of what appears to be a doctoral dissertation was required. These complaints are minor, however, in light of the major contribution that Sussman has made in giving us the most comprehensive study of one of the most important Jewish leaders in pre-Civil War America.
