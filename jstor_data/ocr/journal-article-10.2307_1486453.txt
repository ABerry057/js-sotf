<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM: THE SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE MISHNAH'S SYSTEM OF CIVIL LAW AND GOVERNMENT by JACOB NEUSNER Brown University The Judaism which predominated from the early centuries of the Com- mon Era to the present time, called "rabbinic," or "Talmudic," or simply "Normative" and "Classical," takes shape in the first and second centuries, to be sure drawing heavily upon the heritage of the antecedent millennium, beginning with Scripture itself. In its formative period, documented in par- ticular by the Mishnah (ca. A.D. 200), however, that kind of Judaism for which the Mishnah is the first canonical document after the Scriptures is hardly Talmudic (by definition, the Talmuds coming three centuries later) or rabbinic. While the Mishnaic compilations are rich in allusions to teachings bearing names of people with rabbinical title, in fact those substantive and characteristic interests of rabbinism, in the study of Torah, the interplay between the exegesis of Torah and the doctrines of their own day; the prin- cipal institutions of rabbinism, the court-system and the master-disciple circle; the evocative symbols of rabbinism, Moses "our rabbi," "study of Torah," and the like-none of these is materially represented in the con- structions of the Mishnah itself. Indeed, the Mishnah's picture of the Israelite government is centered 63</page><page sequence="2">64 JACOB NEUSNER upon the then nonexistent institutions of high priest and Temple, on the one side, and king and army, on the other. That "constitution" contained within tractate Sanhedrin omits all reference to the kind of authority which stands behind that and all the other tractates, the rabbi as we know him in his small- claims court and among his disciples. Stated simply: the head of the Israelite government of the Mishnah is not a sage but a high priest and a king. True, the Mishnah knows that the conduct of the high priest and of the king is determined by the Torah taught by sages; the law of the (sages') Torah governs. But the fact remains that the Mishnah's framers cannot imagine themselves in charge of the institutions of Israelite life. By contrast the two Talmuds know that "the rabbis" indeed are the decisors of all things not only in fact but also in form. It follows that, whatever the perspectives of the Mishnah's system of civil law and government, these do not on the surface speak in the interests of a class of sages and bureaucrats, though they most assuredly take for granted the predominance of those interests. Determining the social perspective of the Mishnaic system is compli- cated by the obvious fact that all we have is the document itself. We do not know a great deal about who received and obeyed the Mishnah, how (if at all) its laws were enforced, what people outside of the circles of sages thought of the view and law of the Mishnah as it pertained to them. Nor have we ample data about the class system and structure of the Jews of the Holy Land of the time in which the Mishnah came to closure and thereafter. So, if we are to gain success in any measure, (for this stage of the work) it can only be to shape a theory of the perspective of the document. But that theory must for the moment stand untested by the facts of the context and circumstance, either of the people who stand behind the document, or of the society which was supposed to be governed by it. It follows that for now all depends upon how we read the document itself. What then will be probative for an account of the class perspective of an ancient law-code seems to me not some detail or other, but the character of the whole. True, a law-code deeply interested in returning slaves to their owners may be thought to be a law-code expressive of the interest of the owner, not the slave. But by itself that fact does not lead very far. Unless we have in hand some general rules, proved relevant here, for making sense of law-codes which reflect the interests of slaveholders, we are left with the simple, essentially opaque fact that the code in hand reflects those interests. We know no more about that code, let alone about the society behind it and the world view and way of life contained within it, than we did before we asked about runaway slaves. The real work is to uncover the social perspec-</page><page sequence="3">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 65 tive of the code as a whole, to describe the code's large-scale perspective and to attempt to relate that to the worldview of the people apt to stand behind it. For the discovery of the paramount traits of the code of civil law and government presented by the Mishnah's fourth division, that called Damages, I shall undertake two forms of description. First, I shall rapidly survey the tractates and their topics, surely the necessary first step. Second, at some length I shall try to show what seems to me the most profound and generative concern of the civil law of the Mishnah by simply describing how that law is organized. I cannot think of more neutral, there- fore more probative, evidence than the scheme of laying out the topics, with only passing attention to what is said about those several topics. In the very mute fact that the Mishnah's framers put things in one framework, rather than in some other, I shall claim to uncover deeply embedded evidence of their most critical and their fundamental convictions about society. As we shall see later on, a mere outline of the topical unfolding of Bava Qamma, Bava Meqi'a, and Bava Batra, the three tractates (which are really one) of civil law, will provide that fundamental fact, that basic logic and sense of appropriateness and self-evidence, out of which the social concerns of the framers will become obvious and against which all details of the law will take on meaning. This resort to traits of gross redaction for the social inter- pretation of the fine points of the law constitutes the methodological pro- posal of this rather preliminary report. I The Mishnah's System of Civil Law and Government The division of Damages is comprised of two subsystems, which fit together in a logical way. One part presents rules for the normal conduct of civil society-commerce, trade, real estate, and other matters of everyday intercourse, as well as mishaps, such as damages by chattels and persons, fraud, overcharge, interest, and the like, in that same context of everyday social life. The other part describes the institutions governing the normal conduct of civil society, that is, courts of administration, and the penalties at the disposal of the government for the enforcement of the law. The two sub- jects form a single tight and systematic dissertation on the nature of Israelite</page><page sequence="4">66 JACOB NEUSNER society and its economic, social and political relationships, as the Mishnah envisages them. The main point of the first of the two parts of the division is expressed in the sustained unfolding of the three Babas, Baba Qamma, Baba MeSi'a, and Baba Batra. As we shall see, it is that the task of society is to maintain per- fect status, to preserve the prevailing situation, and to secure the stability of all relationships. The point is so that, in the interchange of buying and sell- ing, giving and taking, borrowing and lending, there be an essential equality of exchange. No party in the end should have more than what he had at the outset, and none should be the victim of a sizable shift in fortune and cir- cumstance. All parties' rights to, and in, this stable and unchanging economy of society are to be preserved. When the condition of a person is violated, so far as possible the law will secure the restoration of the anteced- ent status. An appropriate appendix to the Babas is at 'Abodah Zarah, which deals with the orderly governance of transactions and relationships between Israelite society and the outside world, the realm of idolatry, relationships which are subject to certain special considerations. These are generated by the fact that Israelites may not derive benefit (e.g., through commercial transactions) from anything which has served in the worship of an idol. Consequently, commerical transactions suffer limitations on account of extrinsic considerations of cultic taboos. While these cover both special occasions, e.g., fairs and festivals of idolatry, and general matters, that is, what Israelites may buy and sell, the main practical expression and illustra- tive exercises of principles of the matter pertain to wine. The Mishnah sup- poses that gentiles routinely make use for a libation of a drop of any sort of wine to which they have access. It is therefore taken for granted that wine over which gentiles have had control is forbidden for Israelite use, and also that such wine is prohibited for Israelites to buy and sell. This other mat- ter-ordinary everyday relationships with the gentile world, with special reference to trade and commerce-concludes what the Mishnah has to say about all those matters of civil and criminal law which together define everyday relationships within the Israelite nation and between that nation and all others in the world among whom, in Palestine as abroad, they live side by side. The other part of the division describes the institutions of Israelite government and politics. This is in two main aspects, first, the description of the institutions and their jurisdiction, with reference to courts, conceived as both judicial and administrative agencies, and, second, the extensive discus-</page><page sequence="5">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 67 sion of criminal penalties. The penalties are three: death, banishment, and flogging. There are four ways by which a person convicted of a capital crime may be put to death. The Mishnah organizes a vast amount of information on what sorts of capital crimes are punishable by which of the four modes of execution. That information is alleged to derive from Scripture. But the facts are many, and the relevant verses few. What the Mishnah clearly con- tributes to this exercise is a first-rate piece of organization and elucidation of available facts. Where the facts come from we do not know. The Mishnah tractate Sanhedrin further describes the way in which trials are conducted in both monetary and capital cases and pays attention to the possibilities of perjury. The matter of banishment brings the Mishnah to a rather routine restatement of what is extensively described in Scripture. The crimes punishable by flogging and application of that mode of punishment con- clude the discussion. These matters, worked out at Sanhedrin-Makkot, are supplemented in two tractates, both emerging from Scripture. Leviticus Chapters Five and Six refer to various oaths which apply mainly, though not exclusively, in courts. Leviticus Chapter Four deals with errors of judgment inadvertently made and carried out by the high priest, the ruler, and the people; the Mish- nah knows that these considerations apply to Israelite courts too. What for Leviticus draws the two chapters together is their common interest in the guilt-offering, which is owing for violation of the rather diverse matters under discussion. Now in tractates Shebu'ot and Horayot the materials of Leviticus Chapter Five-Six and Four, respectively, are worked out. But here it is from the viewpoint of the oath or erroneous instruction, rather than the cultic penalty. In the former instance the discussion is intellectually imagina- tive and thorough, in the latter, routine. The relevance of the whole to the issues of Sanhedrin-Makkot is obvious. For the matter of oaths in the main enriches the discussion of the conduct of the courts. The possibility of error is principally in the courts and other political institutions. So the four trac- tates on institutions and their functioning form a remarkably unified and cogent set. Let us now turn to the detailed account of what is to be expected in the eight usable tractates of the division. We shall ignore two miscellaneous ones, 'Abot and 'Eduyot,* tacked on but essentially outside of the frame- work of the division of Damages or any other division of the Mishnah. *This is not to suggest that these two tractates have no place at all in the present division. On the contrary, given the ambition of the framers of the division of Damages-to provide a</page><page sequence="6">68 JACOB NEUSNER A. The rules of civil society 1. Baba Qamma Damage by chattels: assessing damages when the cause is one's property, animate or inanimate. The ox in particular. Damages done in the public domain. The ox in particular. The ransom and death penalty for the ox. Damages done by the pit, crop-destroying beast, and fire. Damage done by persons: theft. Twofold, fourfold and fivefold restitution in the case of theft. Penalties for assault. Penalties for damages done to property; restitution of stolen goods. 2. Baba MeSi'a The disposition of other people's possessions, with special reference to restoration of what someone has lost: conflicting claims on lost objects; returning an object to the original owner. Rules of bailment in the case of conflicting claims. Commercial transactions of an illicit character: over- charge and misrepresentation; true value and fraud; usury and trading in futures; subterranean forms of usury. Licit commercial transaction: hiring workers; rentals and bailments. The mutual obligations of worker and employer; rentals; bailments. Licit transactions in real estate: landlord- tenant relationships; the landlord's relationships with a tenant farmer and sharecropper. Miscellanies: paying workers promptly; taking a pledge for a loan. Real estate: joint holders of a common property and their reciprocal obligations and rights. 3. Baba Batra Real estate: the mutual responsibilites and rights of joint holders of a common property (continued from Baba MeSi'a); not infringing upon the property rights of others; establishing title to a field through usucaption; transferring real estate and movables through sale (as distinct from usucap- tion). Licit commercial transactions: conditions of the irrevocable transfer complete account of an Israelite political system-the function of 'Eduyot, as a kind of miniature-Mishnah, covering the large number of topics treated in other divisions of the document-is not difficult to discern. Its presence allows the division to stand by itself, com- plemented, as it is, with an epitome of the rest of the document. 'Abot, of course, provides a fine picture of the larger intent of the law, the sort of society the Mishnah wishes to build, with its successive statements of how people should behave.</page><page sequence="7">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 69 of movables. Unstated stipulations in commercial transactions. Inheritances and wills; other commercial and legal documents. The preparation and con- firmation of commercial documents, writs of debt, and the like. 4. 'Abodah Zarah Commercial relationships with gentiles: prohibitions precipitated by the advent of a gentile fair or festival; goods of gentiles prohibited even in ordi- nary commerce; goods prohibited for Israelite use but permitted in ordinary commerce. Idols: general principles; the 'asherah; Merkolis (Hermes); nulli- fying an idol. The prohibition of use and of commerce applying to libation wine, that is, to all wine of gentiles. B. The institutions of civil society 1. Sanhedrin The Israelite court system: various kinds of courts and their jurisdiction. The court of three judges and commercial transactions; the court of twenty- three and criminal procedures; the court of seventy-one and political deci- sions. The heads of the Israelite nation and the court system: king and high priest. Property cases: choosing the judges, examining the witnesses, making a decision. Capital cases: the differences from property cases; the layout of the sanhedrin; examining the witnesses, making a decision. The death penalty. The four modes of execution and how they are administered: ston- ing, burning, decapitation and strangulation. Those liable to death through the four modes of execution, respectively. 2. Makkot Perjury: how witnesses are penalized for perjury, e.g., flogging and re- ceiving the penalty they planned to inflict on the accused. The penalty of banishment: those who are sent into exile, the cities of exile. Flogging: those who are flogged, the manner of flogging. 3. Shebu'ot The considerations of Leviticus Chapter Five: uncleanness of the cult and its Holy Things and the guilt offering, oaths: Oaths in general, the rash oath, the vain oath, the oath of testimony, and the oath of bailment. The</page><page sequence="8">70 JACOB NEUSNER oath imposed by the judges for use in settling court cases. Oaths and bail- ments: concluding conundrum. 4. Horayot The offering brought because of an erroneous decision inadvertently made by a court and inadvertently carried out by the community. The offer- ing brought by the high priest who has unwittingly done what is contrary to the commandments of the Torah. That brought by the ruler under similar circumstances. Individual, anointed priest, community: the penalties thereof. II The Topical Arrangement of the Mishnah's Tractates of Civil Law The three Babas as a whole are in two distinct parts, of equal size, each consisting of fifteen chapters covering four topical units. The thirty chapters break precisely in the middle. When we survey the entire construction of the three Babas, what we see is a perfectly simple set of eight units. These move from abnormal events (Units I-IV in the following outline) to normal ones (units V-VIII). The tractates begin with damages done by chattels or by a human being, thefts and other sorts of misappropriation of the property of others, with special attention to how we restore to a state of normality the property and person of the injured party. This large unit on damages and compensation runs through the whole of Baba Qamma and into the middle of Baba Megi'a, down through M. B.M. 5:11. The second half of the three tractates covers normal events-labor relationships, rentals and bailments, then a huge unit on real estate transactions, and, finally, attention to in- heritances and estates. That the intent is to produce two complementary constructions, covering what we may call, generally abnormal or illicit, then generally normal or licit, transactions, is shown by the correspondence of Unit IV, illicit commercial transactions (overcharge and usury), and Unit VII, licit commercial transactions (the legal transfer of goods, unstipulated conditions and how they are enforced). This overall plan may also explain why we have two distinct treatments of bailments, III.C, on damages to bailments, and V.C, E, on the responsibilities of the bailee. The following outline proves the correctness of these statements. Reference is made only to</page><page sequence="9">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 71 the relevant pericopae; a mere allusion to the key words of each one would take up too much space, relative to the proposition at hand.

The preparation and confirmation of commercial documents, e.g., writs of debt. 10:1-6 C. Concluding miscellanies. 10:7-8 The order and simplicity of the plan for the entire sequence of the tractate of the civil law, torts, damages, real estate and commerical transactions, in all of their diversity and complexity, are striking. The plan of the whole is ele- gant as the framers of the three tractates obviously wanted it to be. The goal of the system of civil law is the recovery of the prevailing order and balance, the preservation of the established wholeness of the social economy. This idea is powerfully expressed in the organization of the Babas, which lists, as we have seen, first, abnormal, and, then, normal transactions. The framers deal with damages done by chattels and by human beings, thefts and other sorts of malfeasance against the property of others. The Babas in both aspects pay closest attention to how the property and person of the injured party so far as possible are restored to their prior condition, that is, a state of normality. So attention to torts focuses upon penalties paid by the malefactor to the victim, rather than upon penalties inflicted by the court on the malefactor for what he has done. When speaking of damages, the Mishnah thus takes as its principal concern the restoration of the for-</page><page sequence="11">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 73 tune of victims of assault or robbery. Then the framers take up the comple- mentary and corresponding set of topics, the regulation of normal trans- actions. When we rapidly survey the kinds of transactions of special interest, we see from the topics selected for discussion what we have already un- covered in the deepest structure of organization and articulation of the basic theme. The other half of this group of three tractates presents laws governing normal and routine transactions, many of them of the same sort as those dealt with in the first half. Bailments, for example, occur in both wings of the triple tractate, first, bailments subjected to misappropriation, or accusa- tion thereof, by the bailiff, then, bailments transacted under normal circum- stances. Under the rubric of routine transactions are those of workers and householders, that is, the purchase and sale of labor, rentals and bailments; real estate transactions, and inheritances and estates. Of the lot, the one involving real estate transactions is the most fully articulated and covers the widest range of problems and topics. The Babas all together thus provide a complete account of the orderly governance of balanced transactions and unchanging civil relationships within Israelite society under ordinary condi- tions. III The Social Perspective of the Mishnah's System of Civil Law and Government The character and interests of the division of Damages present compel- ling, indeed probative evidence of the larger program of the philosophers of the Mishnah. Their intention is to create nothing less than a full-scale Israelite government, subject to the administration of sages. This govern- ment is fully suplied with a constitution and bylaws (Sanhedrin, Makkot). It makes provision for a court-system and procedures (Shebu'ot, Sanhedrin, Makkot), as well as a full set of laws governing civil society (Baba Qamma, Baba MeSi'a, Baba Batra) and criminal justice (Sanhedrin, Makkot). This government, moreover, mediates between its own community and the out- side ("pagan") world. Through its system of laws it expresses its judgment of the others and at the same time defines, protects, and defends its own society and social frontiers ('Abodah Zarah). It even makes provision for proce- dures to expiate its errors (Horayot). The (then nonexistent) Israelite government imagined by the second cen-</page><page sequence="12">74 JACOB NEUSNER tury philosophers centers upon the (then nonexistent) Temple, and (then forbidden) city, Jerusalem. For the Temple is one principle focus. There the highest court is in session; there the high priest reigns. The penalties of law infringement are of three kinds, one of which involves sacrifice in the Temple. (The others are compensation, physical punishment or death.) The basic conception of punishment, moreover, is that unintentional infringe- ment of the rules of society, whether "religious" or otherwise, is not penal- ized but rather expiated through an offering in the Temple. If a member of the people of Israel intentionally infringes against the law, to be sure, that one must be removed from society and is put to death. And if there is a claim of one member of the people against another, that must be righted, so that the prior, prevailing status may be restored. So offerings in the Temple are given up to appease Heaven and restore a whole bond between Heaven and Israel, specifically on those occasions on which without malice or ill will an Israelite has disturbed the relationship. Israelite civil society without a Temple is not stable, not normal, and not to be imagined. And the Mishnah is above all an act of imagination in defiance of reality. The plan for the government involves a clearcut philosophy of society, a philosophy which defines the purpose of the government and insures that its task is not merely to perpetuate its own power. What the Israelite govern- ment, within the Mishnaic fantasy, is supposed to do is to preserve that state of perfection which, within the same fantasy, the society to begin with everywhere attains and expresses. This is in at least five aspects. First of all, one of the ongoing principles of the law, expressed in one tractate after another, is that people are to follow and maintain the prevailing practice of their locale. Second, the purpose of civil penalties, as we have noted, is to restore the injured party to his prior condition, so far as this is possible, rather than merely to penalize the aggressor. Third, there is the conception of true value, meaning that a given object has an intrinsic worth, which, in the course of a transaction, must be paid. In this way the seller does not leave the transaction any richer than when he entered it, nor the buyer any poorer (parallel to penalties for damages). Fourth, there can be no such thing as usury, a biblical prohibition adopted and vastly enriched in the Mishnaic thought, for money ("coins") is what it is. Any pretense that it has become more than what it was violates, in its way, the conception of true value. Fifth, when real estate is divided, it must be done with full attention to the rights of all concerned, so that, once more, one party does not gain at the expense of the other. In these and many other aspects the law expresses its obsession with the perfect stasis of Israelite society. Its paramount pur-</page><page sequence="13">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 75 pose is in preserving and insuring that that perfection of the division of this world is kept inviolate or restored to its true status when violated. There are two sides to this philosophy, its social foundations and its metaphysical aspirations. These are not to be divided when we speak of stasis and uncover the pervasive judgment that the way things are, the way the goods of this world are divided, is the way things must be kept. We now speak of people with a sizable stake in the status quo. So we have to ask about that class in Israelite society of the mid-second century which will have invested its best energies into construction of a great system of the imagination devoted to the preservation of the status quo. The interests of the document and the character and definition of the recurrent problems it selects for attention leave little room for doubt that its perspective is that of the householder in a courtyard-the subject of most predicates. He is the proprietor of an estate, however modest, owner of land, however little. He also is a landholder in the fields, an employer with a legitimate claim against lazy or unreliable workers, the head of a family, and the manager of a small but self-contained farm. He is someone who gives over his property to craftsmen for their skilled labor, but is not a craftsman himself. He also is someone with a keen interest in assessing and collecting damages done to his herds and flocks, or in paying what he must for what his beasts do. The Mishnah speaks for someone who deems thievery to be the paltry, petty thievery ("oh! the servants!") of watchmen of an orchard and herdsmen of a flock, and for a landowner constantly involved in transactions in real property. The Mishnah's class perspective, described from its topics and problems, is that of the undercapitalized and overextended upper-class farmer, who has no appreciation whatsoever for the interests of those with liquid capital and no understanding of the role of trading in commodity futures. This landed proprietor of an estate of some size sees a bushel of grain as a mea- sure of value. But he does not concede that, in the provision of supplies and sustenance through the year, from one harvest to the next, lies a kind of increase no less productive than the increase of the fields and the herd. The Mishnah is the voice of the head of the household, the pillar of society, the model of the community, the arbiter and mediator of the goods of this world, fair, just, honorable, above all, reliable. The Mishnah therefore is the voice of the Israelite landholding, propri- etary class (compare Soviet Views of Talmudic Judaism. Five Papers by Yu. A. Solodukho in English Translation, edited with a commentary by this writer [Leiden, 1973: E. J. Brill]). Its problems are the problems of the landowner,</page><page sequence="14">76 JACOB NEUSNER the householder, as I said, the Mishnah's basic and recurrent subject for nearly all predicates. Its perspectives are his. Its sense of what is just and fair expresses his sense of the givenness and cosmic rightness of the present con- dition of society. Earth matches Heaven. The Mishnah's hope for Heaven and its claim on earth, to earth, corresponding to the supernatural basis for the natural world, bespeak the imagination of the surviving Israelite burgherdom of the mid-second century Land of Israel-people deeply tired of war and its dislocation, profoundly distrustful of messiahs and their dangerous promises. These are men of substance and means, however modest, aching for a stable and predictable world in which to tend their crops and herds, feed their families and workers, keep to the natural rhythms of the seasons and the lunar cycles, and, in all, live out their lives within strong and secure boundaries, on earth and in Heaven. That is why the sense of landed place and its limits, the sharp line drawn between village and world, on the one side, between Israelite and world, on the second, and between Temple and world, on the third, evoke metaphysi- cal correspondences which we notice in their full expression in the division of Appointed Times. Israel, Temple, village form a trilogy, in perfect cor- respondence, a deep communion. The Mishnah's deepest limns are loca- tive, not utopian. These are to be preserved and defended in all of their exist- ent, fully realized perfection. Change above all is a threat to the stability, and thus to perfection, to the continuity, of this world of perfect correspon- dences between Heaven and earth. Now when we turn away from the Mishnah's imagined world to the actual context of the Israelite community after Bar Kokhba, we are able to discern what it is that the Mishnah's sages have for raw materials, the slime they have for mortar, the bricks they have for building. The archaeological evidence of the later second and third century reveals a thriving Israelite community in Galilee and surrounding regions, a community well able to construct for itself synagogues of considerable aesthetic ambition, to sustain and support an internal government and the appurtenances of an abundant life. What that means is that, while the south was permanently lost, the north remained essentially intact. Indeed, it would be on the sturdy and secure foundations of that stable community of the northern part of the Land of Israel that Israelite life for the next three or four hundred years-a very long time-would be constructed. So when the Mishnah's sages cast their eyes out on the surviving Israelite world, their gaze must have rested upon that thing which had endured, and would continue to endure, beyond the unimaginable catastrophe brought on</page><page sequence="15">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 77 by Bar Kokhba and his disruptive messianic adventure. Extant and endur- ing was a world of responsible, solid farmers and their slaves and depen- dents, the men and women upon the backs of whom the Israelite world would now have come to rest. They, their children, slaves, dependents could yet make a world to endure-if only they could keep what they had, pretty much as they had it-no more, but also no less. Theirs was not a society aimed at aggrandizement. They wanted no more than to preserve what had survived out of the disorderly past. That is why the Mishnah's is not a sys- tem respectful of increase. It asks no more than that what is, is what to be. The Mishnah seeks the perfection of a world at rest, the precondition of that seal of creation's perfection sanctified on the seventh day of Creation and perpetually sanctified by the seventh day of Creation. But if the philosophers of Israelite society spoke about a real world, a world in being, the values of which were susceptible of protection and pre- servation, the boundaries of which were readily discerned, they also defied that real world. They speak of location but have none. For Israelite settle- ment in the Land then was certainly not contiguous. There was no polity resting on a homogeneous social basis. All Israel had was villages, on a speckled map of villages of many peoples. There was no Israelite nation, in full charge of its lands or Land, standing upon contiguous and essentially united territories. This locative polity is built upon utopia: no one place. The laws of administering the conflicts and quarrels of the Israelite community, as laid forth in the Babas, represent potentially important force for order. Those on the larger institutions of government-Sanhedrin, high priest of a Temple, and king-do not. For the Sanhedrin can have been precisely as real as the Temple and king. There was no Sanhedrin, just as there were no Temple and no king. The nasi of later times was no more to be confused with the nasi of Horayot and of Scripture than was the Roman emperor to be deemed the king of kings of kings. The point needs no amplification. Sages imagine a government out of the materials of the distant past, formed from Scripture and perhaps their own dim recollections of what might have been done, but above all, made out of their own vivid hopes of how things must be done at some point in an undifferentiated future. This act of imagination is the penultimate gesture of defiance. The ultimate one is forming a locative system in no particular place, speaking nowhere about somewhere, con- cretely specifying utopia. So we have two different sorts of things, forming one cogent system. It is a system perched on the precarious edge between how things are and how sages want or imagine them to be. Out of Scripture come many laws on the</page><page sequence="16">78 JACOB NEUSNER civil conflicts of a vigorous village society. From other sources, including logic and imagination, come other laws on that and related topics. So far as Scripture can help, it is a rich source of information. But the system of Damages as a whole is not Scripture's and does not pretend to be. It is an account of practical things in a theoretical framework, concrete cases which reveal significant principles of social intercourse, on the one side, and prac- tical things which describe the institutions of society, on the other. The former not only are practical but can have been practiced. The latter cannot have been other than impractical, in the context of the Israelite political set- ting of the time of the Mishnah and a long time thereafter. Perhaps we find in the Babas a description of how things are; we certainly may rely on the Mishnah's account of the law for a picture of how ordinary affairs would be worked out in time to come. So far as the people of Israel found it possible to decide the little things left in their power, they would look to the Babas and appropriate materials in other parts of the Mishnah for rules governing those small matters. But we surely find in Sanhedrin-Makkot and in other relevant materials a description of a perfect world which never had been, was not in being in the time the Mishnah's framers thought it up, and never would come into being, not then, not ever. That is the curious fact about this division of Damages, its incapacity or disinterest in distinguishing between fantasy and practicality. And yet it is in that dazed perception, that hazy perception of what is and what might have been or may one day be, that we find the measure of the state of mind of the mid-second century philosophers whose work is before us. For the Mishnah's sages confronted so grand a disaster as Israel had never known before. Bar Kokhba brought about the decisive end of the cult-centered world begun at Sinai. No wonder, then, that at every approp- riate opportunity the Mishnah's sages should have linked themselves to the revelation of Sinai. But no wonder, too, that they undertook the monumen- tal task to make a whole new world, a world which, claiming merely to repeat the old, in fresh language spoke about new things to a generation lacking all precedent, bereft of all bond to the past. Once more we refer in our own minds to the impact on the imagination of the Mishnah's framers made by the ultimate, irrevocable end of Temple, cult, sacrifice, and even of Jerusalem. No longer to be denied, this final reso- lution of the enduring symbiosis of people, cult, now-forbidden city, and Land, presented the great thinkers with a problem of thought, of discovery of the weight and meaning of analogy, of exploration of new modes of reflec- tion on new things in a new context and for unpredictable consequences. It</page><page sequence="17">THE DESCRIPTION OF FORMATIVE JUDAISM 79 is this utter lack of precedent which above all poses the question of the age. To this task of thought and interpretation of being only intellectuals were suited. But, in the Mishnah, they show us their power. There were tears in 70, but there then was yet hope. The Mishnah is not a document of lamentation. It is a statement beyond the end of ancient hope, looking backward, therefore speaking of the perfect future. No wonder, then, that it finds new language, to speak of unprecedented subjects, in a new way, addressed to a new context, for a new purpose. And no wonder, either, that its principal statement is about old, enduring things, its principal and generative conception is concerned with preserving the imagined status quo. The Mishnah's primary conviction is focused upon the attainment of sanctification in a world past time, a world made perfect through the accomplishment, on earth, of stasis and the complementarity which would constitute creation's perfection and provoke in Heaven the response of sanc- tification. The Temple's ruins cease to smoulder. Jerusalem is no longer. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done. And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.</page></plain_text>
