<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROFESSOR SALO W. BARON TO THE STUDY OF ANCIENT JEWISH HISTORY: HIS APPRAISAL OF ANTI-JUDAISM AND PROSELYTISM by LOUIS H. FELDMAN A few years ago, a committee, of which I was a member, was asked to select, for a prize awarded by Moment magazine, the greatest living man and woman scholars in the field of Jewish studies. There was immediate consensus as to the former: who else but Professor Salo W. Baron? It is indicative of his almost legendary range of knowledge, of both primary and secondary sources, in the dozen or more languages in which he was fluent, of the general literature in the fields of the humanities and the social sciences, and of his prodigious productivity that a question frequently asked about him was whether he had assistants in the composition of his numerous works. The answer to that question was a resounding no! His 1</page><page sequence="2">2 LOUIS H. FELDMAN only assistant was his late wife. His unflagging industry was matched only by the independence of his critical judgment. In his monumental eighteen-volume second edition of A Social and Religious History of the Jews and in his three-volume The Jewish Commun- ity, Professor Baron gave new directions to the study of Jewish history in three major respects: (1) he insisted that Jewish history be viewed as part of the general history of the world and not in isolation from the cultures among which the Jews have lived, that the Jews have always had interac- tions with their neighbors, and that it is true not merely that Jews have sig- nificantly influenced the world but also that the world has influenced the Jewish people: (2) he stressed that Jewish history be viewed not merely as the history of spiritual and cultural heroes but as the history of ordinary people, with emphasis on demographic, economic, political, legal, and sociological developments; (3) he argued that Jewish history is not one of endless tears but that it should be viewed much more optimistically. This last point is particularly noteworthy in view of the fact that the revised edi- tion of his Social and Religious History of the Jews started to appear in 1952, only a few years after what is generally agreed to have been the greatest catastrophe in the history of the Jews, the Holocaust. Professor Baron always insisted that the task of the historian is to give not only an accurate account of events but, more important, an insight into the factors which molded those events. Of Socrates Aristotle says that he brought philosophy from heaven down to earth. Of Professor Baron it may be said that he shifted the emphasis in the study of Jewish history from chronology to underlying social events. Moreover, he insisted that the historical explanations of the Jewish past must not fundamentally deviate from the general pattern of history which we accept for mankind at large or for any other particular national group. Basically eclectic and con- servative in his interpretations, he utilized in the study of history the var- ious techniques that the modern social sciences have developed without being committed to any single one. Indeed, in his last book, The Contem- porary Relevance of History (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), published at the age of ninety-one, he chose as his subtitle "A Study in Approaches and Methods," and typically discussed the various approaches to Jewish history in the much broader context of approaches to the study of history in general, concluding with a plea for methodological pluralism. His scholarship appeals to Jews of almost all persuasions inasmuch as he saw value in many kinds of Jewish communities, personalities, and ideas, and rather than praising or blaming them he sought to understand them.</page><page sequence="3">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 3 The eighteen volumes of his Social and Religious History of the Jews cover the period until 1650; but it is ironic that Professor Baron died just at the point where he was ready to begin his survey of the period, namely the modern era, which was his particular strength. In his review of the first two volumes, which cover the ancient period, the inimitable Professor Solomon Zeitlin insisted that only a syndicate of specialists could ade- quately cover the vast expanse of Jewish history and quoted the talmudic maxim, Tafasta merubah lo tafasta, that is, by attempting too much, one fails of achievement.' And yet, it is my contention that while Professor Baron may be challenged on individual points of his synthesis, the fact that he was able to view every portion of Jewish history against the backdrop of the whole has given us enormous insight into each individual part of the picture. My task here is to evaluate Professor Baron's contribution to the understanding of ancient Jewish history, particularly of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the importance of which he realized as the key to the understanding not only of modern Jewish history but also of Western civi- lization generally, inasmuch as it was during these periods that the Holy Scriptures were canonized, that the discussions embodied in the most char- acteristic and most influential document-the Talmud-reached their cli- max, that Jews experienced a tremendous population explosion, that from a position of relative insignificance Jews rose to prominence in national and international affairs, that the greatest catastrophe prior to the Holo- caust, namely the events associated with the three wars against the Romans and the destruction of the Second Temple, took place, and last but hardly least important, that the prodigal son known as Christianity was born. Professor Baron has called our attention to the fact that there has hard- ly been an era in history in which so large a portion of the world, namely the Roman Empire, was, as Pliny the Elder declared, "like one city" (Natural History 12.32.65).2 Such being the case, it was natural for the small country known as Judea and for the Jews generally to feel the eco- nomic and social effects of the Pax Romana and, indeed, to become part of 1.

FELDMAN the new economic system. Moreover, the pilgrimages to the Temple in Jerusalem thrice annually on the occasion of the festivals brought Pales- tinian Jewry into contact with the far-flung Diaspora Jewry, so that, in effect, we may remark, Jerusalem became a kind of miniature replica of much of the whole inhabited world of that day. This served to break any tendency to isolationism on the part of the Jews. Rather than survey Professor Baron's entire work in the field of ancient Jewish history, I have chosen to concentrate on two key areas, namely his analyses of ancient antisemitism (the term is, of course, quite inappropri- ate, since "Semitic" should be reserved for a family of languages)3 and of proselytism by Jews. If I may here inject a personal note, many years ago, when I wrote an article entitled "Philo-Semitism among Ancient Intellectuals,"4 a colleague of mine at Yeshiva University indignantly objected to the idea that there ever was a time when Jews were admired by non-Jews, let alone by non- Jewish intellectuals. Professor Baron, on the other hand, counterposes the hatred of Israel and the love of Israel as the two pivots of Jewish history.5 Indeed, throughout his work he insists on the inadequacy of what he called "the lachrymose conception of Jewish history," so dominant in the nine- teenth century,6 a goodly portion of the foundation of which, I would sug- gest, is Josephus' account of the gruesome events in the Jewish war against the Romans. Until fairly recent times, Jews seem, as a group, to have been enamored of tales of persecutions and were quite unprepared for, and even perhaps resented, the evidence that for large portions of their history they had lived in relative security. Hatred of Jews has certainly served to unite 3. See Louis H.

In his last published work, The Contemporary Relevance of History: A Study in Approaches and Methods (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), p. 30, Professor Baron suggests that the stress on the lachrymose conception of history was consciously or unconsciously placed at the service of the Jewish Emancipation movement, since it helped to refute the argument that giving Jews full equality would hurt society through the expansion of usury by Jews. By emphasizing the sufferings of the Jews, these historians emphasized that the shortcomings of Jews were due to the discrimination and oppression to which they were con- stantly subject, and that once these disappeared the Jews would become integrated with the rest of society.</page><page sequence="5">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 5 Jews; perhaps there is a fear that if Jews are not hated the need for strong Jewish communal leadership would be diminished. We must start with the truism, to which Professor Baron calls our attention, that ancient religions, with the exception of Assyria, being polytheistic, were tolerant of other religious points of view, whereas mon- otheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are not (1.117).7 Hence, we may remark, the pagan emperor Alexander Severus in the third century kept in his sanctuary, together with statues of the deified emperors, statues of Abraham, Jesus, and Orpheus.8 Professor Baron does not deny the existence of anti-Jewish bigotry in antiquity. Indeed, he says that almost every note in the cacophony of medieval and modern anti-Judaism was sounded by the chorus of ancient writers (1.194). When questioned at the Eichmann trial by Robert Serva- tius, the chief attorney for the defense, as to the causes "of that negative attitude which had existed for so many hundreds of years and of that war against the Jewish people," he replied, "The answer is: dislike of the unlike."9 In a programmatic essay entitled "Changing Patterns of Anti- semitism: A Survey,"' Professor Baron, in support of this analysis, cited Haman's statement in the Book of Esther (3:8): "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king's laws; therefore it profiteth not the king to suffer them." Amicus Plato, sed amicior veritas. With all due respect to Professor Baron, however, the key clause here is not that the laws of the Jews are diverse from those of every other people, but rather that they do not obey the king's laws; hence, Haman's contention could win acceptance in the court circles in Susa. Inasmuch as in antiquity religion was always an in- tegral part of the state, the fact that the Jews did not worship the gods of the state was always, ipso facto, grounds for suspecting that they were not loyal to their country; and, in fact, when Jews had their own independent state, Diaspora Jews were always under suspicion of dual loyalty. Indeed, we are prepared to argue that anti-Jewish attitudes as such are not gener- 7. See also Salo W. Baron, "Changing Patterns of Antisemitism: A Survey," Jewish Social Studies 38 (1976): 10. 8.

FELDMAN ally to be found in antiquity, at least not on the part of governments or at least not as a continuing policy." As to the cause of the hatred of Jews being the dislike of the unlike, here too we may take issue with Professor Baron. Indeed, Balsdon has well indicated how the Romans, for example, viewed those who were unlike them. Thus, they said that in India people slept on their ears; the Brah- mans were completely celibate for thirty-seven years, after which they married as many wives as they could; there were medicine men who could determine the sex of unborn children; and there were naked sophists who made prophecies until they had been proven wrong three times, after which time they had to be quiet.'2 This sort of thing may lead at most to bemused contempt of Indians; it does not lead to hatred, let alone persecution of Indians. Similarly, Sardinians were regarded as bri- gands and congenital liars, and, as the old saying had it, "Sardinians for sale; if one is bad, others are worse." Yet they were not hated, let alone persecuted; indeed, they were recruited in large numbers for the Roman navy.'3 As for the British, they were said to be hardly civilized and indeed inhospitable, only better than the Irish, who were devoid of any redeeming virtues whatsoever.'4 With regard to the Arabs, there was a story that a cart belonging to the god Hermes, loaded with various kinds of mischief, broke down in their country and was plundered by the natives, whence the fact that the Arabs were "liars and impostors, who did not know the meaning of truth."'5 As for the Egyptians, the author of the Bellum Alex- andrinum writes: "If I was briefed to defend Alexandrians and to establish that they were neither treacherous not irresponsible, I could make a long speech but it would be a wasted effort."'6 With regard to the Greeks, they were irresponsible playboys, sloppy, crooks, sycophants, chatterboxes, full of conceit.'7 Indeed, two of the charges against Jews, that they were lazy 11.

BARON 7 and superstitious, were also made by Tacitus against the Germans. But in none of these cases do we have organized hatred or persecution. Further- more, in the Pro Flacco Cicero attacks not only the Jews but also the Phry- gians, the Mysians, the Carians, and the Lydians; moreover, in his speech for Cluentius (139), Cicero himself points out the differences between his true opinions and those that he expressed as a lawyer. To be sure, there are a number of hostile references to Jews, but many of them come from rhetorical historians or satirists, where the passages are clearly colored and exaggerated. We have no guarantee that the passages that have come down to us are at all representative; in fact, ironically many of them are extant only because they are preserved in Josephus' tract against them, Against Apion. Moreover, according to my count, 101 (18 percent) of the comments by pagans in Stern's collection are substantially favorable to Jews,'8 339 (59 percent) are more or less neutral, and only 130 (23 percent) are substantially unfavorable.'9 Furthermore, there is no evi- dence that even the most damning of these charges, the canard that the Jews hate mankind20 and the charge, clearly reminiscent of the medieval blood libel, that they even practiced ritual slaughter of foreigners,21 ever, so far as we know, led to outbreaks against Jews. Indeed, the philosopher Seneca the Younger, who refers to the Jews as a most accursed people (sce- leratissimae gentis)22 whose customs have gained such influence that they are now received throughout the world, was apparently unable to affect the policies of the emperor Nero, despite the fact that he was virtually ruling Rome during the early years of Nero's reign. The seminal nature of Professor Baron's work can best be seen in the vistas which he opens with a mere remark. Thus, he notes, to be sure only in passing, that several ancient intellectuals were favorably impressed with the Jews (1.184). We may here add that if we analyze the remarks ascribed 18.

The percentages in the two substantive volumes are essentially the same. In vol. 1, from Herodotus in the fifth century B.C.E. through Plutarch in the first century C.E., 47 notices are favorable (16 percent), 69 are unfavorable (24 percent), and 165 are neutral (60 percent). In vol. 2, covering the period from the second through the sixth century, 54 are favorable (20 percent), 61 are unfavorable (21 percent), and 174 are neutral (59 percent). 20.

FELDMAN to Aristotle, we shall find that he is actually praising the Jew whom he met in Asia Minor as the possessor of no less than the four cardinal virtues- wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice-and that, apparently forgetting his own rule about generalizing from specific cases, he concludes that the Jews are a nation of philosophers.23 Similar pro-Jewish remarks may be found in the writings of Theophrastus, Megasthenes, and Hecataeus, all dating from about 300 B.C.E. In the first century B.C.E., the Roman phil- osopher and antiquarian Varro, whom Quintilian (10.1.95) calls the most learned of the Romans, praises the imageless worship of the Jews, noting that the early Romans had similarly worshipped the gods without images, and adds that if this custom had continued the gods would be worshipped with greater purity.24 We may likewise add that the felicity of expression in the Jews' great book, the Bible, is praised by one of antiquity's most distinguished literary critics, pseudo-Longinus, the author of the treatise On the Sublime (9.9) in the first century C.E., who compliments the sublime effect achieved by "the lawgiver of the Jews-no mean genius, for he understood and gave expres- sion to the power of the divinity as it deserved-when he wrote at the very beginning of his laws ... 'God said'-what? 'Let there be light. And there was. Let there be earth. And there was.' " "Longinus" includes this pas- sage, together with four others from Homer and a verbal exchange be- tween Alexander the Great and Parmenio, to illustrate his point that the basic ingredient of great writing is not literary style but rather a great mind. Since this is the last example cited, it would seem to be the climax, and the compliment is all the greater. Moreover, it is unlikely that "Lon- ginus" would use a quotation utterly unknown to all his readers; and if it were unfamiliar, he should have said more about the work. In addition, from the way that "Longinus" refers to this passage and to Moses, not bothering to identify him by name, presumably because his readers knew who the "lawgiver of the Jews" was, it seems clear that he was acquainted with much more from the Bible than this passage alone.25 23.

Some scholars, such as Konrat Ziegler, "Das Genesiscitat in der Schrift Peri Hup- sous," Hermes 50 (1915): 572-603, have argued that the citation from Genesis breaks the train of thought of "Longinus," and that the parallels with Jewish thought and vocabulary could not possibly stem from him. But Hermann Mutschmann, "Das Genesiscitat in der</page><page sequence="9">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 9 In support of Professor Baron's intuition that there was much more philo-Judaism than is generally thought, we may also add that even in those writers who seem to be hostile to Jews there are often pro-Jewish intimations.26 Thus Manetho, an Egyptian priest in the third century B.C.E., declares that the Jews had been mixed up with a crowd of Egyptian lepers and were consequently banished from Egypt;27 yet the fact that he speaks (ap. Josephus, Against Apion 1.235) of Moses as one of the learned (logion) priests would enhance the reputation of the Jewish leader, especial- ly since the word logion which Manetho uses implies not only erudition but also skill and eloquence in words, an attribute much prized among the Greeks. Furthermore, by declaring, as does Apion (Against Apion 2.28), that the Jews were Egyptians by race, the opponents of the Jews were actually associating them with what the Greeks regarded as the most Schrift Peri Hupsous," Hermes 52 (1917): 161-200, correctly noted that the passage in ques- tion is very much in place and is, indeed, the climax of the argument by "Longinus." Eduard Norden, "Das Genesiscitat in der Schrift vom Erhabenen," Abhandlungen der deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, Klasse fOr Sprachen, Literatur und Kunst, 1954, no. 1 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1955), has suggested that "Longinus" was a pagan Greek author who knew and used Jewish writings, especially those of Philo. Theodor Mommsen, R6mische Geschichte (Berlin: Weidmann, 1885), 5:494; Wilhelm von Christ, Geschichte der griechischen Literatur, bis auf die Zeit Justinians, 4th ed. (Munich: Beck, 1905), p. 788; and Walter B. Sedgwick, "Sappho in 'Longinus' (X,2, Line 13)," American Journal of Philology 69 (1948): 198-199, have called him a Hellenized Jew. George P. Goold, "A Greek Professorial Circle at Rome," Transactions of the American Philological Association 92 (1961): 177, says that he belonged to the same environment which produced Philo, and that he was in some sense a Jew. John G. Gager, Moses in Greco-Roman Paganism (Nashville: Abingdon, 1972), p. 63, plausibly states that since the line of demarcation between Greeks with Jewish sympathies and Hellenized Jews was extremely vague in cultural, philosophical, and religious matters, we can- not draw any convincing conclusion in the matter. 26. An intriguing question is why the church, which was, to some degree, at least, respon- sible for the preservation of classical writers both in the East and in the West, permitted the anti-Jewish writings of the six leading anti-Jewish authors cited by Josephus in his Against Apion-Manetho, Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Apion, Poseidonius, and Apollonius Molon-to be lost. In my "Pro-Jewish Intimations in Anti-Jewish Remarks Cited in Josephus' Against Apion," Jewish Quarterly Review 78 (1987-88): 191-194, I conjecture that one of the reasons why the church decided not to preserve the anti-Jewish writings was that they contained some pro-Jewish concessions or implications or were more neutral than the church preferred. 27.

FELDMAN ancient of civilizations.28 Even the archenemy of the Jews, Apion, admits that the Exodus occurred in the time of Inachus, the first king of Argos, who was a contemporary of Amosis, the king of Egypt.29 This would con- cede tremendous antiquity to the Jews, inasmuch as Inachus was said to be the son of Oceanus and Tethys, both of whom were Titans, and hence of the second generation of the Greek gods. Even Tacitus, who has some vicious comments about the Jews, presents several theories of their origin which are actually very complimentary. One of them states that the Jews were fugitives from Crete who settled on the nearest coast of Africa at the time when Saturn was driven from power by Jupiter (Histories 5.2.1). Since Saturn was a Titan, and since the Cretans were acknowledged to have had a mighty and glorious civilization long before mainland Greece, this would push back the date of the Jews to remote antiquity. According to another theory, the Jews were of Ethiopian stock and had been driven by fear and hatred to seek a new dwelling-place during the reign of Cepheus, king of the Ethiopians (Histories 5.2.2). The very fact that they are identified as Ethiopians, who were renowned in antiquity for their wisdom, piety, and bravery, would lend luster to their name. Still another complimentary the- ory traced the Jews back to the Solymi (Histories 5.2.3); such an origin would connect them with Bellerophon, the grandson of Sisyphus, whose most difficult battle, according to Homer (Iliad 6.184-185), was against them. Even the charge that the Jews showed hostility to foreigners30 might well have been viewed sympathetically by those who realized that a similar charge was often brought against the much-admired Spartans, whose pres- tige was especially high in first-century Rome.3' Moreover, the very stub- bornness of the Jews in their obedience to the law, which, to be sure, is ridiculed by the anti-Jewish Agatharchides (Against Apion 1.209-212), would have elicited praise from many of the ancients, since this was a qual- ity possessed by the Spartans (Against Apion 2.225), inasmuch as they had remained faithful for so long to Lycurgus' laws. Again, the Jews were not alone in their secretiveness and their reluctance to associate with for- 28. See, e.g., Herodotus 2.2; Diodorus 1.1 1.5-6; and Philo, De Specialibus Legibus 1.1.2. 29. Ap.

As for the Jews' lack of inventiveness, as charged by Apollonius Molon,33 this was clearly a lau- datory trait to Herodotus (2.142), who writes that it was the boast of the Egyptians that throughout their history of 11,340 years no change had taken place in their nature, manners, or customs; similarly, Plato's ideal state admits of no change (Republic 8.546a). As to the Jews' irrationality in abstaining from certain foods, Pintarch asks how one can condemn the Egyptians for irrationality in abstaining from certain animals when the Pythagoreans, who were certainly highly respected, especially during the revival of Neo-Pythagoreanism in the first century B.C.E. and in the first century C.E., have regard for a white cock and refrain from eating red mul- let and the sea anemone (Quaestiones convivales 4.5.2). Professor Baron remarks that, on the whole, after Constantine the legal situation of the Jews was much more favorable in the Persian than in the Roman Empire (2.180). This is undoubtedly true, but we may perhaps qualify this remark by noting that de facto, even in the Roman Empire the Jews were not so badly off, inasmuch as there is much evidence that the laws were simply not enforced.34 Moreover, as Professor Baron correctly remarks, even after the triumph of Christianity the Christian masses got along very well with their Jewish neighbors. (2.188); and we may add, to judge from the bitterness of John Chrysostom's sermons, as well as from the edicts of church councils,35 they were even attracted to the synagogue and to certain Jewish practices. What, then, was the chief cause of the tension between Jews and non- Jews in antiquity? Here, again, Professor Baron has given us excellent insights which we ourselves may develop. In effect, it was a head-on colli- sion36 between Roman expansionism-a kind of "manifest destiny," as noted, for example, by Cicero (Pro Flacco 28.69) and Pliny the Elder (2.5.39)-and Jewish expansionism-a vast wave of proselytism and mes- 32.

FELDMAN sianism; and that the Romans were aware of this messianism and of its importance to Jews may be seen in the writings of Tacitus (Histories 5.13.2) and of Suetonius (Vespasian 4.5).37 Rome, we may remark, as preached by such important propagandists as Virgil, had a messianic-like mission: "You, O Roman, remember to rule the nations under your sway. These will be your arts-to ordain the way of peace, to spare the conquered, and to humble the haughty" (Aeneid 6.851-853). Likewise, Horace declares: "An object of dread, let her [i.e., Rome] extend her name far and wide to the most distant shores .... Whatever limit bounds the world, let her reach that by her arms" (Odes 3.3.45-54). A second-century Greek rhetorician, Aelius Aristides, thus praises Roman imperialism, stressing that the Roman mission is divinely blessed: "Marvelous, unique in the world, is your magnificent concept of citizenship. You have divided your whole world empire into two classes. Those of more culture, pedigree, and influence you have everywhere made Roman citizens ... ; the rest are your subjects. Distance from Rome either by sea or by land makes no difference to citizenship; Asia or Europe, it is all the same. No one worthy of office or trust is an alien. A universal democracy has been established under one best ruler. .. . Before your rule everything was upside down and drifting aimlessly, but under your charge confusion and strife have ceased, every- where order has emerged, and the bright light of prosperity and good government. Laws have been proclaimed, and the gods' altars win men's confidence.... Now universal and manifest freedom from fear has been granted to all the earth and those that dwell therein. . ... The gods, beam- ing upon your empire, have had their part in its ordering and confirm you in its possession" (To Rome 59-60, 64-65, 101, 103, 104). It is his constant awareness of the relationship of Jews to movements in in the non-Jewish world that leads Professor Baron to note that the conservative groups in Rome felt endangered by the progressive dissolu- tion of accepted morals and, consequently, by the evident success of Jewish religious propaganda, which, by definition, undermined the basis of Roman religious polytheism (1.191). It was the much-quoted Ennius who, in his Annales, remarked, Moribus antiquis res stat Romana viresque--"The Roman state and its strength rest on the foundation of the ancient ways." Livy, the great national historian of Rome, in the preface to his history 37. Cf. Josephus, War 6.312.</page><page sequence="13">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 13 (1.9), laments the relaxation and the decline of morals, leading to "the downward plunge which has brought us to the present time, when we can endure neither our vices nor their cure." Indeed, one of the chief planks in the platform of the emperor Augustus was to reawaken a sense of morality by reviving religious rites and ceremonies which had fallen into neglect because of the attraction of new cults and the disorder and cynicism brought on by the century of more or less uninterrupted civil war preced- ing his principate.38 An important element in the new order was the intro- duction of the worship of the emperor, with the emperor himself serving as pontifex maximus, which served the key function of helping to unite the far-flung empire.39 Needless to say, the Jews could not participate in such worship and had to depend upon the exemption that was constantly, with few exceptions, given to them. As Professor Baron notes (1.191), Tacitus (Histories 5.5), though writing a full generation after the seemingly com- plete victory of Roman arms in Judea, came to what was to him a truly bitter conclusion-that the Roman victory was far from deciding the issue, inasmuch as the Jews, in his eyes, remained a menace to the established order. If, in the words made famous by Simeon the Righteous (Avot 1:2), the world rests on three things: Torah, the Temple service, and deeds of loving kindness, for the Romans the three main pillars were religion, country, and family. It is precisely in these areas that Judaism was irrecon- cilable with Roman ideals, inasmuch as from a Jewish point of view Roman polytheism was prohibited even to non-Jews as one of the seven commandments of the sons of Noah (Sanhedrin 56a); Judaism defined itself not merely in terms of religion but in terms of a national identifica- tion; and the laws of family purity and the prohibitions of intermarriage, abortion, and infanticide were cornerstones of Judaism. Finally, the fact that Judaism made inroads in the highest levels of Roman life, including even the imperial family-e.g., Flavius Clemens at the end of the first cen- tury (Dio 67.14.1-2)-was a source of particular embarrassment to the Romans. It is almost precisely at the time that Roman expansion was at its height that Jewish expansion by proselytism reached its climax.

FELDMAN tory was in stressing quantitative history, that is, estimating population figures and quantitative economic data-a topic that has been sadly neg- lected by historians of the Jewish people. In a programmatic essay that remains a model which few have even attempted to follow, Professor Baron set forth careful and comprehensive guidelines for estimating Jewish populations.40 "The question of population," he says, "in every nation and every period is of great importance for the understanding of all facets of public life, economic and political as well as cultural." He then proceeds to quote David Hume's remark that it is "the most curious and important of all questions of erudition."4' Indeed, in one of his essays, Professor Baron reminisces about a discussion that he had in the 1920s with Stephen S. Wise and Judah Magnes in which he dreamed aloud about writing a book some day on "Jewish History in the Light of Numbers."42 Professor Baron was fully aware of the enormous difficulty confronting anyone undertaking to estimate Jewish populations, especially in view of the predilection of many ancient and medieval authors for exasperatingly high numbers and the greater likelihood of errors in the transmission of numbers than in the transmission of almost any other kind of data. And yet, as he has noted, population and other censuses and compilations of lists of taxpayers were much more frequent and more searching in antiquity than is generally known today. To be sure, censuses, especially of taxpayers, always invite evasion, and no attempt is made to break the figures down according to various categories of age, sex, marital status, etc. As all who have studied Professor Baron's work know, his extended footnotes are often even more seminal than his text. One such footnote is to be found in the first volume of his Social and Religious History (1.370-372, n. 7). In it he attempts at length to estimate the number of 40. Salo W.

This is all the more remarkable when we consider his estimate, in a pathfinding article, that a mere half a millennium earlier, in 586 B.C.E., the total number of Jews was a mere 150,000.43 Indeed, Professor Baron, with good reason, makes the bold conjecture that the Jews, who had for centur- ies been sought after as soldiers, constituted a power which, if properly marshaled, could perhaps have ventured to defy successfully the most for- midable military nation in history until that time (2.90).44 Likewise, the fact that Lukuas-Andreas was able to wage such a long war against Trajan (115-117), arguably the greatest of all Roman emperors so far as military prowess was concerned, and that Bar Kochba, a few years later (132-135), was able to fight for so long against the ablest Roman general of the time, Julius Severus, who had with him the famous Tenth Legion and elements of nine other legions, confirms the sheer multitude and power of the Jews. The next question, of course, to which Professor Baron then addresses himself at length, is how to account for this population explosion. His explanation is threefold: natural increase of a highly prolific race, gains through proselytism, and comparatively slight losses through apostasy. To these factors we may now add that the expansion and intensification of agriculture in Ptolemaic Egypt succeeded in yielding food to a degree unrivaled until a century ago, so that a larger population generally, and of Jews in Egypt in particular, could be supported.45 Professor Baron points to proselytism as the most important factor, though he has to admit that we know of no professional missionaries,46 and though, we may add, we do 43.

Professor Baron notes that Titus had four legions, whereas previously three legions had been sufficient to conquer all of Armenia (2.92). Again, Josephus would have been a laughingstock if his statement (War 1.1) that the war between the Jews and the Romans was the greatest not only of the wars of his time but of all wars that had ever been waged had not had a real basis in fact. 45. See Karl W. Butzer, Early Hydraulic Civilization in Egypt: A Study in Cultural Ecology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976), pp. 91-92. 46. As to why no missionaries are mentioned, we may suggest that the one author who might have been expected to name them, Josephus, is not particularly interested in religious history and, in any case, is careful not to offend his patrons, the Romans, who were very sen- sitive about proselytizing. As to the rabbis in the talmudic corpus, they were, for the most</page><page sequence="16">10 LOUIS H. FELDMAN not possess any missionary tracts as such. Indeed, the case of the royal family of Adiabene (Josephus, Antiquities 20.49-53) indicates that the con- version was done through contact with itinerant Jewish merchants, that is, amateur missionaries.47 We may comment, however, that the very fact that the New Testament (e.g., Acts 9:15) speaks, without further explanation, of Paul as being a chosen instrument of God to carry His name before the Gentiles, thus indicating the role of a missionary, would show that such a function was not considered novel. To be sure, we may remark, Tcherikover, in a seminal article, basing himself largely on the identity of authors found among the literary papyri, has questioned the concept of a concerted Jewish literary propaganda in the interests of conversion.48 He challenges the views that Jewish literary propaganda among the pagans was technically possible and that the dis- tribution of books in the ancient world was similar to that of modern times, that books were produced in large numbers of copies and were sold in thousands of shops and sent to distant countries, and that famous au- thors had their own "publishers" who profited from these sales. But liter- acy was apparently much more widespread than we usually think, certainly by the first century and definitely in the towns.49 Furthermore, it cannot be doubted that it was the schools-where the Septuagint or Jewish mission- ary tracts would hardly be read-that were largely responsible for the pre- servation of so many literary papyri as we have. Moreover, the texts of the papyri, for the most part, come from private homes or from the refuse heaps of various provincial towns; they usually represent the books that were discarded rather than the books that were read.50 part, living at a time (after the Bar Kochba rebellion) when proselytizing had diminished in volume and had even become dangerous; they, too, were, in general, not interested in antag- onizing the Romans. 47. In typical fashion, Professor Baron, recognizing the importance of economic factors in religious movements, conjectures that Ananias, the Jewish merchant-missionary who convert- ed the royal family of Adiabene, may have been prompted more by a wish to enlist royal sup- port for his commercial transactions than by religious zeal (1.173). 48.

BARON 17 Indeed, a clue that the Septuagint was used for proselyting purposes may be seen in Philo's remark that the translation was made so that "the greater part, or even the whole, of the human race might be profited and led to a better life" by the Torah's wise and admirable ordinances (De Vita Mosis 2.6.36). Furthermore, Philo comments that each year, on the anni- versary of the completion of the translation, a festival was held on the island of Pharos, off the coast of Alexandria, where the translation was made, to which not only Jews but also others, "with their whole multi- tude," came (De Vita Mosis 2.7.41). Surely those who came must have had their interest aroused in the document they were celebrating. That Philo had great hopes that the Septuagint would lead non-Jews to adopt Judaism is clear from his statement of belief, put into immediate juxtaposi- tion with his account of the translation of the Septuagint, that "each nation would abandon its peculiar ways and, throwing overboard their ancestral customs, would turn to honoring our laws alone" (De Vita Mosis 2.7.44). Indeed, one concrete instance where reading the Bible did have an effect upon a candidate for conversion is to be seen in the account of the conversion of Izates, the king of Adizbene, who decided to be circumcised after being told by the Jew Eleazar that he ought to do more than read the Bible (Josephus, Antiquities 20.44-46). But, of course, all this assumes that it was through reading tracts that people were converted, whereas there is every reason to believe that people were converted for the most part through oral persuasion. Indeed, Philo comes close to suggesting that there were Jewish teachers and preachers who, as it were, stood on their soapboxes in the agora (De Specialibus Legibus 1.59.320-323). Moreover, Philo remarks that on each Sabbath day there were thrown wide open in every city thousands of schools teaching the cardinal virtues with respect to duties to God and man (De Specialibus Legibus 2.15.62-63). The fact that these Jewish schools (i.e., synagogues) are said to be wide open and that there are said to be thousands of them would indicate that they attracted large numbers of the general population, and not merely Jews. Professor Baron's insightful contribution in this area is his discussion of the motives that led Gentiles to convert to Judaism. In typically compre- hensive and eclectic fashion he considers not only the religious and philo- sophic appeal of Judaism but also the economic and social factors. As he notes, during the Hellenistic and early Roman imperial period, particularly during the first century B.C.E. and the first century C.E., to become a Jew</page><page sequence="18">18 LOUIS H. FELDMAN appeared an advantage rather than an obstacle to an economic career,5' especially in view of the contacts that one might expect with Jews, above all in port cities, throughout the known world of that day, the solidarity of the Jewish people, their strong communal organization, and their out- standing charitable institutions (1.174-175).52 We may suggest that the very fact that a Jew might, at least in those areas where rabbinic influence was strong, obtain a loan without interest must in itself have been a great attraction, especially in view of the prevailing rate of 24 percent.53 More- over, we may add, in an era when there was widespread abject poverty, unemployment, and starvation, the assurance that no Jew would be allowed to starve must have proven attractive. Indeed, Philo calls attention to the fact that food, drink, clothing, and all the rights concerning daily life and necessary needs were granted to proselytes on an equal basis with those who were born Jews (De Virtutibus 20.104). Professor Baron makes the perceptive comment that when Rome became a Christian power, other kings, for example in southern Arabia, were stimulated by similar political considerations to adopt Judaism (2.165). In this connection we may suggest that the conversion to Judaism of the royal family of Adiabene may have been prompted by a desire to seek neutrality between the two great powers of the day, Rome and Par- thia, just as centuries later the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism may 51. We may also suggest that the synagogues were attractive to non-Jewish businessmen for economic reasons. If, indeed, it was important, as the new inscriptions from Aphrodisias show, to list the occupations of donors, it may be that a particular synagogue attracted those who had certain occupations, just as we hear that in the great synagogue in Alexandria seat- ing was by trade (Sukkah 51b). Hence, people in specific trades may have come to the syna- gogue to meet those with whom they did business or who were members of the same craft. 52. One of the inscriptions from Aphrodisias, dated in the third century, according to its editors, mentions a patella, which they interpret to mean a soup kitchen, to which the list of names that follows contributed. This, then, we may suggest, may have been one of the attrac- tions to Judaism, or at any rate to the synagogue, on the part of those who were poverty- stricken. See Joyce Reynolds and Robert Tannenbaum, Jews and Godfearers at Aphrodisias (Cambridge: Cambridge Philological Society, Supplementary vol. 12, 1987), p. 27, and the discussion by Louis H. Feldman, "Proselytes and 'Sympathizers' in the Light of the New Inscriptions from Aphrodisias," Revue des etudesjuives 148 (1989): 287-288. 53. In Egypt, however, we may note, on the basis of the loan documents that have sur- vived in the papyri, Jews were lending money to their fellow-Jews at the usual rate of interest. See Louis H. Feldman, "The Orthodoxy of the Jews in Hellenistic Egypt," Jewish Social Stu- dies 22 (1960): 236.</page><page sequence="19">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 19 have been motivated, at least in part, by a desire to attain neutrality be- tween the major powers of that day, Byzantine Christendom and Islam. Furthermore, we may call attention to the fact that Judaism seems to have made inroads particularly among women, to judge, for example, from Josephus' remark that on the eve of the great war against the Romans, the inhabitants of Damascus were determined to kill the Jews but were afraid of their own wives, "who with few exceptions, had all become converts to the Jewish religion; and so their efforts were mainly directed to keeping the secret from them" (War 2.559-561). Indeed, Professor Baron insightfully conjectures that one of the reasons why Judaism was attractive to non- Jewish women was that Roman husbands, at least theoretically, by virtue of their patria potestas, exercised authority over the life and death of their wives, whereas women in Judaism had a much more favorable status (1.191). To be sure, of course, the rabbis, at least at a later date, refused to accept converts who came to Judaism for ulterior motives such as these (Yevamoth 24b); but, as Professor Baron correctly remarks, they were real- istic enough to understand the complexity of human motives and hence decided, as summarized in the words of the third-century Ray (ibid.), that once admitted, even those who came for ulterior motives were to be accepted as full-fledged proselytes (1.175). Furthermore, as Professor Baron perceptively notes, the world situation was propitious for the spread of Judaism (1.173). Indeed, we may suggest, just as Judaism, with its expe- rience and success in gaining converts, paved the way for Christianity's later efforts, so, in an earlier period, the spread of Hellenism had torn down barriers separating peoples from one another, so that soon every- thing Oriental-and this included Judaism-had become fashionable and a great age of syncretism ensued. In addition to the proselytes, Professor Baron says, there must have been throughout the empire even larger numbers of people-the so-called "God-fearers" or "sympathizers"-who adopted some of the main tenets of Judaism without actually converting (1.178). We may remark that the numerous passages in the New Testament,54 in pagan writers such as the first-century satirist Petronius (fragment 37, Ernout), the first-century phi- losopher Epictetus (ap. Dissertationes 2.19-21), and, above all, the early- 54. Acts 10:2, 22, 35; 13:16, 26, 43, 50; 16:14; 17:4, 17; 18:7.</page><page sequence="20">20 LOUIS H. FELDMAN second-century satirist Juvenal (14.96-99), as well as in Philo (Quaestiones in Exodum 2.2), and in Josephus,55 support Professor Baron's statement. Further confirmation of the success of Judaism in winning God-fearers, we may add, may be seen in the new inscriptions from Aphrodisias, where we have the names of no fewer than fifty-four such "sympathizers."56 Some have objected to Professor Baron's use of the term "semiproselytes,"57 but whatever term is used, surely he is right in noting the widespread presence of people who observed certain tenets of Judaism without actually convert- ing. The tremendous success of the Jews in winning adherents aroused sheer panic. In the first century B.C.E. Horace, one of the two major poet- laureates of the Augustan Age, refers to Jewish missionary zeal as if pro- verbial: "We are much more numerous, and like the Jews we shall force you to join our throng" (Satires 1.4.142-143). To be sure, Horace is a satirist; but his satire would have fallen flat had his obvious exaggeration been baseless. Even the philosopher Seneca, as Professor Baron correctly points out, lost his Stoic composure when he claimed (ap. Augustine, City of God 6.11) that "the customs of that most accursed nation have gained such strength that they have now been received in all lands: the conquered have given laws to the conquerors."58 Professor Baron goes so far as to conclude that by growing too fast Judaism had absorbed too many alien elements, physically and culturally, had made too many compromises, and had flirted with too many alien ways of life and thought, and that this resulted in sharp sectarian and po- litical divisions which almost brought Judaism to the brink of extinction (2.129). It is, we may suggest, no mere coincidence that sectarianism in 55. War 2.454, 463, 7.45; Antiquities 14.110. See the discussion of these and other passages referring to "sympathizers" in Louis H. Feldman, "The Omnipresence of the God-Fearers," Biblical Archaeology Review 12, no. 5 (September-October 1986): 58-69. 56. For other evidence as to the existence of "God-fearers," see Feldman, "Proselytes and 'Sympathizers,' " pp. 274-282. 57. E.g., Zeitlin, in his review of the first two volumes of Professor Baron's Social and Religious History of the Jews (p. 105), objects to his use of the term "semiproselytism," assert- ing that Judaism has never recognized semiproselytism. But we may reply, in Professor Baron's defense, that he never says that Judaism gave recognition to semiproselytes; in fact, he says (2.149) that the rabbis fought against incomplete conversion with all means at their disposal. But what Professor Zeitlin cannot deny is that there were such people. 58. Baron, "Changing Patterns of Antisemitism," p. 9.</page><page sequence="21">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W. BARON 21 Judaism and, of course, the rise of Christianity came at precisely the same time as the height of the proselytizing movement in Judaism. It was the tremendous success of Jewish proselytism, we may add, which provoked three attempts to expel the Jews from Rome itself. Indeed, our earliest reference to the Jews in Rome informs us that a Roman offi- cial, the praetor peregrinus, banished the Jews from Rome in 139 B.C.E. "because they attempted to transmit their sacred rites to the Romans,"59 implying proselytism, or, as another version has it, "because they attempt- ed to infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius,"60 imply- ing an attempt at syncretism or, more likely, an endeavor to spread Jewish practices among "sympathizers" without requiring the rites of conversion. But that the expulsion was not a case of anti-Judaism would seem to be indicated by the fact that in the same year all astrologers were likewise expelled from the city. Similarly, previously, in the year 186 B.C.E. (Livy 39.8-18), the Roman Senate had voted to suppress the Bacchanalia, which had acquired a reputation for drunken orgies that were breeding grounds for immorality, and hence a threat to the social fiber and stability of the Roman state.6' Apparently, however, the expulsion of 139 B.C.E. was short- lived, since in 59 B.C.E. Cicero, doubtless with a lawyer's exaggeration, speaks of the "big crowd" of the Jews and notes how they stick together and how influential they are in informal assemblies (Pro Flacco 28.66). And later in the century Horace speaks of energetic Jewish missionary activities (Satires 1.4.139-143). The second expulsion of Jews from Rome occurred in the year 19 C.E. and appears again to have been connected with missionary activities.62 59. Valerius Maximus 1.3.3, in the epitome of Januarius Nepotianus (ca. 500 C.E.). 60. Valerius Maximus (1.3.3), in the epitome of Julius Paris (ca. 400 C.E.). 61. For similar reasons rhetoricians and philosophers had been expelled in 161 and 154 B.C.E. 62. See Josephus, Antiquities 18.81-84; Tacitus, Annals 2.85; Suetonius, Tiberius 36; Dio Cassius 57.18.5a. Ernest L. Abel, "Were the Jews Banished from Rome in 19 A.D.?" Revue des etudes juives 127 (1968): 383-386, concludes that the decree was directed against prose- lytes alone, since Tiberius was a strict adherent of the law and would not have banished a citi- zen without a trial, and that all that Tiberius insisted upon was that Judaism be practiced only by those who were Jewish by birth. A likely allusion to the episode apears in Seneca, who notes, though without mentioning the Jews by name, that in Tiberius' reign some foreign rites were introduced and that the proof that a person was an adherent of the new cult was his abstention from the flesh of certain animals, a possible allusion to Jewish dietary laws (Epis- tulae Morales 108.22).</page><page sequence="22">22 LOUIS H. FELDMAN Josephus specifically links the expulsion with the deception practiced by some Jewish embezzlers on a Roman lady, Fulvia, who had become a proselyte. He says that Tiberius ordered the whole Jewish community to leave and that the consuls sent 4,000 of them to Sardinia for military ser- vice. Indeed, the third-century Dio Cassius explicitly states that Tiberius banished most because they "were converting many of the natives to their ways" (57.18.5a). The Jews must have returned very quickly from their exile, inasmuch as during the reign of Claudius (41-54 C.E.), we hear that the emperor expelled from Rome the Jews who had persisted in rioting at the instiga- tion of a certain Chrestus (Suetonius, Claudius 25.4 and Acts 18:2).63 This expulsion likewise, we may remark, was motivated by Claudius' concern to foster the ancient Roman religion; thus he had even tried to revive the ancient Etruscan lore of the soothsayers, while, on the other hand, outlaw- ing the intrusive lore of the Gallic Druids as foreign to Roman concepts. Professor Baron remarks that during the century following the Bar Kochba rebellion (132-135), the missionary zeal seems to have reached a low ebb, to be revived later, particularly outside the reach of Christian Rome (2.388, n. 27).64 No doubt Professor Baron is correct, but new evi- dence, especially from two third-century inscriptions from Aphrodisias in Asia Minor, indicates that the outreach movement in Judaism had hardly come to an end, and that the number of God-fearers, in particular, contin- ued to be considerable.65 Indeed, this was a period in which several Eastern 63. Dio Cassius, to be sure, says that Claudius did not expel the Jews, inasmuch as they had increased so greatly in numbers, but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings (60.6.6). In any case neither Josephus, who is very full at this point, nor Tacitus makes any mention of an expulsion. If, as most scholars believe, the reference to Chrestus is actually to Christus, i.e., Jesus, perhaps only the Christians were expelled, though Acts 18:2 very clearly states that Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. Stern, Greek and Latin Authors, 2.116, suggests that perhaps Claudius did, indeed, intend to expel all the Jews from Rome and may even have issued an edict to that effect, but that, under pressure from the Jews and presumably especially from Agrippa I, who was so instrumental in getting the imperial throne for him (Josephus, Antiquities 19.236-244), he revoked the order and forbade only the right to assemble. 64. Zeitlin, in his review, pp. 98-99, criticizes Professor Baron for not differentiating be- tween the views on proselytism of Hillel in the first century and those of Eleazar ben Pedat in the third century; but the fact is that there is continuity on a theoretical level toward prosely- tism. The differences come in point of fact when proselytism is forbidden upon pain of death. 65. See Feldman, "Proselytes and 'Sympathizers,'"' pp. 265-305.</page><page sequence="23">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF. SALO W.

Again, Professor Baron reminds us that after Constantine the Roman Empire became even more intolerant of Jewish religious propaganda, and that both external and internal forces united to reduce proselytizing and to increase the nationalist ingredients in the life and thought of the Jews (2.150). We may, however, remark that Judaism vigorously continued, even in the fourth and fifth centuries, to attract both converts and "sympa- thizers," and that it continued to influence "Judaizers" and Jewish Chris- tians, as is evident from the frequent repetition of imperial laws, canons of church councils, comments of church fathers, remarks of rabbis, inscrip- tions, and papyri.66 Indeed, it is clear that far from withdrawing into itself or restricting itself to a conflict built around the interpretation of sacred texts, Judaism boldly confronted the church. One of the most striking indi- cations that proselytism continued to be practiced by Jews during these centuries is that, of the sixty-six laws in the Codex Theodosianus pertaining to Jews, fourteen (21 percent) deal with the proselytism of free men, and twelve (18 percent) deal with the conversion of slaves. Hence, we can see that the question of conversion to Judaism was by far the single most important issue pertaining to the Jews on which the emperors legislated, and that the issue remained unresolved, at least to the satisfaction of the emperors, for centuries. Surely the proselyting movement was aided by the fact that, especially during these centuries, laws were often observed in the breach and provincial governors were so frequently corrupt.67 Undoubted- ly one reason for the vigorous campaign of the emperors against proselyt- ism, especially at a time when the empire was fighting for its very life against barbarians to the north and Persians to the east, was the fact that conversion to Judaism meant not only adherence to a religion but also membership in a nation which, after three desperate attempts in 66-74, 115-117, and 132-135, still looked forward to a messianic redemption that included independence from Rome as a key item in its agenda. Moreover, if, after Christianity had officially become the religion of the empire in 380, a golden-mouthed orator of the capacity of a John Chrysostom was un- 66.

FELDMAN able to halt the attraction of Judaism to Christians, at least in the year in which he delivered the sermons, we can well imagine how much greater the attraction might well have been in the previous century, when the church was being persecuted, when several leading neoplatonic and neo- Pythagorean intellectuals had expressed admiration for Judaism, and when Judaism enjoyed its traditional general privileges. In fact, we may conjec- ture that the increased wave of philo-Judaism in the second and third cen- turies may have been due in part to a reaction against the relatively greater militancy of Christianity in seeking converts. Following through on Professor Baron's insights in seeking various fac- tors that continued to attract non-Jews to Judaism even in the third, fourth, and fifth centuries, we are now in a position to add the following:68 the long history of the loyalty of the Jews to the state; a political attempt to win the support of the apparently numerous and influential Jewish com- munity; the reputation that Jews had for regard for law and order, espe- cially in an era marked by extensive lawlessness and even anarchy; a shelter against persecution (in the period before Christianity attained licit status), since the Jews continued to maintain their special privileges; the sheer antiquity of Judaism, granted even by such bitter anti-Jewish bigots as Tacitus; the reputation of the Jews for wisdom, for ethical behavior, for lack of materialism; the euphoria that accompanied the emperor Julian's efforts to rebuild the Temple; the attraction of the special foods and the period of rest that marked the observance of the Jewish Sabbath and holi- days; the awe aroused by Jewish scrolls in contrast to the more mundane Christian codices; the ancient and awesome oaths taken before Torah scrolls; the music and even theatricality of the services in the synagogue;69 the relics of Jewish martyrs; the solemnity of the Jewish ritual baths; and admiration for Jewish astronomers, astrologers, alchemists, physicians, and magicians. We may well ask why, in view of this head-on collision between the manifest destiny of the Roman Empire and the enormously successful proselyting activities of the Jews, the Roman rulers continued to grant spe- cial privileges to the Jews, especially when we consider, as Professor Baron correctly stresses (1.234) and as we have remarked, that in antiquity reli- 68.

In particular, he has noted that the responsible rulers of the empire, beginning with Julius Caesar and Augustus, perceived both the concentrat- ed Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel and, especially, the Jewish dis- persion as having benefits for Rome's imperial interests.70 We may note, furthermore, that during the first century B.C.E. and the first century C.E., the number of kingdoms in the Near East ruled by Jews-petty kingdoms for the most part, to be sure-was considerable. Moreover, any people that could attract so many myriads from throughout the world as did the Jews for the three pilgrimage festivals each year could not be viewed with disdain."7 Indeed, according to the count taken by the Roman governor Cestius Gallus, there were approximately 2,700,000 on hand to participate in the sacrifices in Jerusalem for Passover at the outbreak of the war against the Romans; and this did not include those who were menstruous or otherwise disqualified (Josephus, War 6.425).72 Furthermore, the sheer wealth of the Temple, which collected a half-shekel from every Jew and even from God-fearers each year (Antiqui- ties 14.110),73 must likewise have been most impressive.74 The permission granted the Jews to ship money to Jerusalem must have seemed remark- able in view of the scarcity of money throughout the empire, particularly during the first century B.C.E.; indeed, in 63 B.C.E., four years before Cicero defended Flaccus when the latter was accused of sending Jewish money to Rome for deposit in the public treasury, the Roman Senate had passed a resolution forbidding the export of gold and silver from Italy because of the shortage. Moreover, there is some evidence that the ties of the Dias- 70. Baron, "Changing Patterns of Antisemitism," p. 10. 71. See Philo, De Specialibus Legibus 1.12.69 and De Providentia (ap.

Even if this figure is exaggerated, as it appears to be, the number must have been impressive. 73. See Feldman, "Omnipresence of the God-Fearers," p. 67, n. 32. 74. Well aware that his readers would question his statement about the great wealth of the Temple, Josephus notes that "there is no lack of witnesses to the great amount of the sums mentioned, nor have they been raised to so great a figure through boastfulness or exaggera- tion on our part, but there are many historians who bear us out, in particular Strabo" (Anti- quities 14.111).</page><page sequence="26">26 LOUIS H. FELDMAN pora Jews with those of the Land of Israel were close, as we see, for exam- ple, in the statement of the Egyptian Jewish general Ananias in 102 B.C.E. to Queen Cleopatra that if she did injustice to Alexander Jannaeus, the king of Judea, she would make all the Jews her enemies (Antiquities 13.354);75 in the fact that in the year 55 B.C.E., Jewish soldiers guarding the Egyptian frontier were persuaded by Antipater, the ruler of Judea, to allow a Roman proconsul to enter Egypt to restore his favorite to the throne (Antiquities 14.131-132); and in the fact that in the year 48 B.C.E., Jewish soldiers in the Egyptian army, persuaded by Antipater (who showed them a letter from the high priest Hyrcanus), allowed an army of allies of Julius Caesar to come to his aid (Antiquities 14.131). In other words, the Romans were pragmatists who, like the Persians and Alexander and Alexander's successors before them, realized that they were too few in number to maintain control over such a vast empire and that the Jews were simply too numerous and too powerful economically to be treated with disdain. Hence, they adopted a policy of tolerance or be- nign neglect, stopping the Jews only when their nationalism or their prose- lytism became an immediate threat to the empire. We may see this pragma- tism in Titus' refusal, even after the fierce resistance that the Jews had put up during the war, to grant the request of the people of Antioch to expel the Jews or even to diminish their privileges (War 7.100-111, Antiquities 12.121).76 Similarly, although the Bar Kochba rebellion was the most seri- ous military challenge to the Romans during the reign of Hadrian, it is sig- nificant that Antoninus Pius alleviated Hadrian's decrees forbidding the practice of Judaism and permitted the Jews to circumcise their own chil- 75. Professor Baron conjectures that the anti-Jewish riots recorded in Alexandria in 88-87 B.C.E. may have been caused by the passions aroused by the charge of double loyalty that presumably resulted from this incident (1.216). 76. Menahem Stern, "Antisemitism in Rome," in Shmuel Almog, Antisemitism Through the Ages (Oxford: Pergamon, 1988), p. 14, correctly remarks that the Roman victory in this war was considered the greatest military exploit of the Flavian dynasty, as seen in the various allusions to it in the Latin poetry of that generation (e.g., Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 1.12-14; Silius Italicus, Punica 3,600-606). Furthermore, as Stern points out, a famous inscription dating from the year 80 in honor of Titus refers to him as one who had subjugated the Jewish people and the city of Jerusalem and remarks that this was an achievement which no general or king or people had ever previously accomplished (Corpus Inscriptionum Latin- arum 6.944 = M. McCrum and A. G. Woodhead, Select Documents of the Principates of the Flavian Emperors, Including the Year of Revolution [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966], no. 53).</page><page sequence="27">THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROF.

It is to Professor Baron that we owe the insight to view both anti- Judaism and proselytism in antiquity in proper perspective, evaluating the two currents against the backdrop of Roman manifest destiny and realiz- ing the strength that the Jews maintained even after their huge losses in the revolts against the Romans. When Aeneas in Virgil's epic lands in Carth- age and sees the history of the Trojan War, which had ended with such seeming disaster for him, painted on the walls, he halts and laments: Sunt lacrimae rerum-"There are tears in life" (Aeneid 1.462). Professor Baron's painting of ancient Judaism, while not avoiding the tears that are there, is healthier, more normal, and more sanguine. Certainly Professor Baron is correct in remarking that the average Jew in antiquity was, if measured by such objective criteria as standard of living, cultural amenities, and protec- tion against starvation and disease, no less happy than his non-Jewish con- temporary (1.24).
