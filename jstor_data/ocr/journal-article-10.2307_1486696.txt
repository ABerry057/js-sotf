Swartz In exploring the social background of early Jewish mysticism, Scholastic Magic tells the story of how imagination and magic were made to serve memory and scholasticism. In the visionary literature that circulated between the fifth and ninth centuries, there are strange tales of ancient rabbis conjuring the angel known as Sar- Torah, the "Prince of the Torah." Through close readings of this literature, Michael Swartz uncovers unfamiliar dimensions of the classical Judaic idea of Torah. "Scholastic Magic will take its place alongside a growing list of important studies in the history of Jewish mysticism and magic.... lucidly written and well orga- nized."-Elliot Wolfson, New York University Cloth: $35.00 ISBN 0-691-01098-6 The Order of Terror The Concentration Camp Wolfgang Sofsky Translated from the German by William Templer "[Sofsky] shows the structure of the concentration camp as a complex place of modern civilization.
