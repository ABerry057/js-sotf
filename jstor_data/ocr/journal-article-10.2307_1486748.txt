<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard A. Cohen. Elevations.- The Height and the Good in Rosenzweig and Levinas. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994. xviii, 342 pp. Perhaps the case no longer needs to be made that Emmanuel Levinas is not only an important figure on the intellectual scene but also a profoundly Jewish thinker who engages the philosophical issues of our time with Jewish wisdom. I fear, however, that both philosophers and scholars of Judaism have failed to grasp the profundity of the meeting within Levinas's work. Richard Cohen provides a strong and accessible argument that locates the emphatic ethics of Levinas in its Jewish tradition. He establishes the difficult case that the themes and moves in the philosophical corpus of Levinas are related intimately with Jewish thought, and in complex ways parallel to Rosenzweig's thought. Cohen has devoted himself to Levinas for many years, editing volumes, translating important essays, and offering his own interpretations in many contexts. The result is that in Cohen's book we have the single best in- troduction to Levinas for the context of Jewish Studies. The biographical essay in chapter 5 ("Emmanuel Levinas: Philosopher and Jew") is a fine doorway into Levinas's thought, articulating his background in Lithuanian Haskalah, Musar, and the thought of Reb Haim of Volozhyn. The relation of philosophy and Judaism is very much what is at stake throughout Cohen's book. He recognizes that for Levinas's work the import of Judaism for our philosophical moment is more vital than issues concerning Jews and Judaism as such. Thus Cohen focuses throughout the book on Levinas's philosophical works-for philosophy is in the sorry state, in this century, of recognizing a nonrepentant Nazi, Martin Heidegger, as its greatest thinker. But Cohen is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 139 not saying that a traditional Jew or a Talmud scholar or a social historian of Jews in the Mediterranean will learn nothing from Levinas. What Levinas has to say about Judaism is important. But what is most engaging in Cohen's book, and in Levinas's work, is the address to philosophy from out of the sources of Jewish thought. Similarly strong are chapters 6, 8, and 12--"On Temporality and Time," "God in Levinas," and "Exceeding Husserl." Each is not only helpful and insightful, but is crafted elegantly and makes matters that are quite obscure even in Levinas's own best expositions refreshingly clear to any reader. Cohen is a great teacher of difficult issues in Levinas's thought, leading us in to the most difficult matters, such as the relation of the present of the imperative to the immemorial past of election. The book, moreover, is doubled: for both in the title and in Parts I and III, Cohen engages Franz Rosenzweig. While .there are serious issues of disagreement between my reading of Rosenzweig and Cohen's, the major argument of this book is one I share: Rosenzweig is engaged in an ethics parallel to and profoundly influential for Levinas's. Chapters 2 and 4, the first contrasting Rosenzweig and Heidegger, the second offering an excellent reading of Rosenzweig's famous letter to Buber on reading a draft of Part I of Buber's I and Thou, are the best of Cohen's treatments of Rosenzweig. More, the latter is a definitive reading of the contrast and tension between the two thinkers who went on to collaborate on a Bible translation. In the process, the reader sees the serious stakes in interpreting ethics in interpersonal relations and the importance of asymmetry in the I-thou relation, recognized by both Rosenzweig and Levinas. In the former chapter, Cohen not only displays the gaps between Rosenzweig and Heidegger, especially on history and interrelations between people, but also allows us to see the proximity of the two thinkers. In general, Cohen throughout his book marks the convergences of Rosenzweig and Levinas, but with due care notes some of the tensions, and indeed allows for a certain sort of reciprocal critique. For while Rosenzweig seems too exclusive, limiting redemption to Jews and Christians, and Levinas seems more universal, it also is the case that Rosenzweig emphasizes love more clearly and brings forward Jewish thought more trenchantly. There are several places where Cohen's interpretations do not allow the profound interaction of Jewish thought to engage contemporary intellectual concerns. I will focus on two issues that will help stretch Cohen's readings. The first centers on the interpretation of Rosenzweig's The Star ofRedemption. Cohen is eager to read Part I as Creation, and Part III as Redemption. The</page><page sequence="3">140 BOOK REVIEWS structure that governs the Star is more discontinuous. Part I, in particular, concerns the truth of the pagan worldview. Rosenzweig is remarkable not only for his positive evaluation of Christianity, but for his subtle reading of paganism and its eternal truth. The pagan position is not adequate for Jews, and it is not adequate to redeem the world, but it is not simply false or antithetical to Judaism. This more deeply complicates the relation of Jewish thought to that which is now called postmodern, and is represented most emphatically by Heidegger. The important contribution of the Greeks, which both Rosenzweig and Levinas explore, is not merely an historical condition for Rosenzweig's and Levinas's thought. The Greeks stand as a logical or conceptual condition to which Jewish thought is bound, even as the ethics of Judaism reorients it. While one bristles under the bold and harsh rhetoric of some of Cohen's comments about other scholars, the final chapter of the book disappoints because it limits our access to Derrida, but more importantly because it ignores Levinas's own interpretation of textuality and interpretation. Cohen may be correct in his call to man the barricades against the tactic of hesitation that guides some fans of Derrida as they prune the ethics out of Levinas. But Cohen fails to notice how deeply implicated Levinas is in the relations through texts and in the issue of the absence of the author. Both in later Jewish writings and in Otherwise than Being, Levinas advances a truly complex account of how a book is interrupted discourse catching up with its own tears, where the interruptions are like knots that leave traces where the tears have been. This account of textuality as textile invites careful reading, as Derrida has done in his second essay on Levinas, but it also points to a deeper Jewish insight into how holy texts work. Levinas may not be improving on rabbinic hermeneutics, but he does translate it into an idiom that addresses the very fads in literary criticism that Cohen suspects. By facing-off against the Derrida crowd in a polemical battle, Cohen hides from view what is one of Levinas's (and Rosenzweig's) most decisive contributions. For in addition to orienting philosophy from the ethics of interpersonal relations (as Cohen has so carefully explored here), Levinas and Rosenzweig resuscitate a rabbinic view of how texts in their warp and woof, and in their call for ongoing reading, engender the ethical insights that characterize the Height and the Good.
