Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. viii, 327 pp. This book discusses cults surrounding sainted figures in Islam, and secon- darily in Judaism, from many points of view. It urges researchers to go beyond "the traditional methods of interpreting Jewish and Islamic texts," and to probe the "hu- man dimension of spirituality." It maintains that studying the practices, beliefs, and idiosyncratic deeds directed to sainted personages-both alive and dead-allows us to explore spiritual paths along which we meet the poor as well as the power- ful, and both the theologian and the unschooled believer. "Cult of saints" is a compact phrase, but each chapter unpacks one aspect of the phenomenon, pointing to its multifaceted nature and to the variation within it. The first chapter discusses how space becomes sacred. While precise origins are rarely known, often there is a combination of popular attraction to a place with some striking physical feature and the evocation of a tradition linked to a text-based or historical spiritual hero. The second chapter explores aspects of sainthood, ex- amining both theological notions and the associations of notions of baraka (cog- nate of Hebrew berakha) in social and religious contexts. In contrast to Muslims, Jews appear to have actively related to saints without a doctrine of sainthood. The next and longest chapter, "Experiencing the Holy," discusses pilgrimages and the rituals embedded within them. It considers the ambivalence inherent in practices, which implies that they are substitutes for the obligatory or more established vis- its to Mecca or Jerusalem. Drawing upon Arnold Van Gennep and Victor Turner, it documents the range of human needs, emotions, crises, ideas, and social stations that become engaged in pilgrim behavior. Next is a short chapter on Jewish pil- grimage. Data on Jews appear throughout the study, while this discussion explores the overlap-or absence thereof-between Muslim and Jewish notions of ziyara (visits to a shrine). It cites material depicting pilgrimages of special importance to Jews (often simultaneously with their being the focus of Muslim visits), such as the tomb of Samuel near Jerusalem and of Ezekiel in southern Iraq, and places where Elijah is claimed to have appeared throughout the Middle East. The last chapter (excluding a brief conclusion) focuses on pilgrimage "places." It contains a typology that organizes the range of physical attributes of sites that have become sanctified "ranging from cairns to elaborate mausoleums, tomb complexes, and domed shrines (qubba)" (p. 262). This discussion underlines a general point of the book, demonstrating both how widespread "the" cult of saints is (I would drop the definite article), but also how necessary it is to study the subject in its diverse and specific manifestations. The bulk of the book deals with Muslim life and brings many extended quotes documenting the ubiquity and significance of socioreligious relations with saints. Like many of the topics and notions discussed, the word "saints" is used as shorthand for a range of terms and concepts, which the author lays forth, illustrat- ing different nuances and contextual meanings. As part of this approach, we learn of different theological stances regarding sainthood or the practice of ziyara. It is clear that the learned tracts are relating to popular religious expressions that pre- dated Islam and continued to develop after it became hegemonic in the regions. 360</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Different attitudes are linked to the Sunni-Shi'i divide, and the influence of Su- fism is discussed. The attention to saints among Jews (often, but not only, termed tzaddikim), serves to underline that one is dealing with a widespread phenomenon which elite literati could not eliminate from their purview. It is not clear why Chris- tian groups are not included in the study, particularly as they are occasionally men- tioned and because some of the shrines are traditionally attributed to Christian figures like St. John the Baptist, known as Yahya b. Zakariya. Information on Jews is also presented extensively. Jews shared some saints conceptually with Muslims (Elijah is known as al-Khadir), and also visited some of the same sites (the tomb of Ezekiel in Kifl was the site of Yom Kippur worship but Muslims were not absent from the scene). The material often derives from ex- isting collections. For example we are exposed to Petahiyah of Regensberg through Elkan Adler's volume on travelers, and we are given an English version of part of Zvi Ilan's publication of a fourteenth-century Geniza document (caution may be in order in some instances, e.g., on p. 243 what should be Iyyar is rendered Adar). The book cites other contemporary work, notably by Elhanan Reiner, and a refer- ence to Issachar Ben-Ami recalls more recent Maghrebi saint adoration. Zvi Yehu- dah's historical work on Jewish-Muslim rivalry in relation to the Ezekiel site is overlooked, as is Yoram Bilu's anthropological investigations in Israel that reveal the multilayered personal meanings that are entailed in relations to saints and bear relevance to past eras. It is interesting to speculate (beyond the stated purpose of the book), about what is it that awakens scholars of Judaica from time to time to attend to this "peripheral" topic, linked to the geographical spread and location of Jews. Meri's work suggests that the subject may not be as marginal as one thinks, but a vital dimension of religious imaginations that deserves further study. Harvey E.
