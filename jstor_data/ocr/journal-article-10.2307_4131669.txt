<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 30:2 (2006), 325-345 BEYOND THE VERSE: MIDRASH AGGADAH AS INTERPRETATION OF BIBLICAL NARRATIVE by Devora Steinmetz The 1980s saw the introduction of postmodem literary theory into the field of rabbinic literature, in particular into the study of midrash, which began to be explored as anticipating or aligning with many of the claims of modem literary theorists. This new interest intersected oddly at times with the prevailing historicist mode of inquiry. For many scholars, the notion of textual indeterminacy supported the idea of the interpreter of the text as essentially an "eisegete," who reads the text from his or her own historically embedded perspective, rather than as an exegete, who at least attempts to find out what the text "really means." Thus, scholars who embraced this new perspective often rejected an inquiry into midrash as biblical interpretation in the classic sense of the word. "No one believes anymore," someone pointed out to me after a session on midrash in a conference during the mid-1980's, "that texts have meaning." Happily, discourse about midrash has become more nuanced in the succeed- ing two decades, with scholars both questioning the fit between postmodem literary theory and midrashI and, not so differently from colleagues in literary studies, recognizing that the openness of texts does not preclude the idea of texts having meaning or, at least, constraining interpretation.2 Similarly, a reduc- tive historicist approach to rabbinic texts has been challenged by scholars who seek to tease out the range of factors that lead to a given interpretation, including, among others, the interpreter's attempt to disclose the text's meaning.3 1.

Kugel, ed. Hindy Najman and Judith 325</page><page sequence="2">Devora Steinmetz Still, though, the idea of midrash as (among other things) exegesis of the biblical text has largely focused on midrash as a response to local surface irregularities in the text. That is, the sages of classic midrash are seen as trying to solve problems on the level of the word or verse, not as offering broad interpretations of biblical narrative. James Kugel, the scholar who is perhaps most associated with the focus on midrash as interpretation, sums up his approach: "Ancient biblical interpretation is an interpretation of verses, not stories."4 The renewed interest in midrash as exegesis, though, offers an opportunity to revisit the commonly accepted assumption that midrash addresses the biblical text only atomistically. My goal in this article is to suggest that, in studying aggadic midrash, we would do well to ask what larger reading of the biblical narrative might underlie and shape midrashic interpretation. This question, I suggest, should be asked even of midrashim that are clearly attempting to solve surface exegetical problems. There are, of course, numerous ways to solve any particular exegetical problem, and so the particular solution offered, it stands to reason, must be dictated by more than the need to find a resolution to the local problem.5 I will argue the point by offering one demonstration of how we might read a midrash as offering a broad interpretation of a biblical story. The midrash that I have chosen is one that has received some attention as exegesis in the narrow sense of the word-that is, as attempting to solve problems on the level of the words and the verse on which it comments. Kugel has carefully demonstrated H. Newman (Leiden, UK: Brill, 2004), 399-422, as well as his discussion of the "facings" of ancient scriptural commentary in From Tradition to Commentary.: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), esp. 13-15. 4.

Geoffrey H. Hartman and Sanford Budick (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), 77-103, originally published in Prooftexts 3 (1983), 131-55. 5. This is true even when the technique used is a standard midrashic technique: The explanation of the midrashic solution is not exhausted by identifying the problem and the technique that the midrash is employing to solve the problem. For example, Isaak Heinemann's principle of "the flight from anon- ymity" (Darkhei Ha 'Agada [Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1949], 28-30) suggests that the sages of the midrash were uncomfortable with people being referred to in the biblical text without names or other identifying information. Therefore, midrashim tend to identify unnamed figures-or figures who are named but whose names give us no information about who they are--with better-known figures. But, of course, the midrash generally has recourse to more than one possible figure with which to identify an anonymous character; the choice of figure with whom the anonymous character is identified, I suggest, is often shaped by a broad interpretation of the narrative. See, for example, Devora Steinmetz, "A Portrait of Miriam in Rabbinic Midrash," Prooftexts 8 (1988), 35-65, for the identification of the anonymous "lad" and Eldad and Medad in Numbers 11:26-27 and of Shifra and Pua in Exodus 1:15; for the identifications of Amrafel and Malkizedek, see Steinmetz, From Father to Son: Kinship, Conflict, and Continuity in Genesis (Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1991), 145-47, 198-99 nn. 40, 42-44.

I will begin by presenting the midrash that Kugel discusses and summar- izing the most apparent local exegetical problems to which the midrash is responding. I will then move away from the midrash to focus on the biblical story and offer a particular reading of the story. And finally, I will suggest that the midrash itself is based on-and suggests-this reading of the biblical story and that attention to the broader interpretive activity of the midrash accounts for the details of the midrash's solution to the local exegetical problems. The midrash appears as part of a longer passage in Tanhuma; I will introduce additional elements of the larger Tanhuma passage later in the discussion. It should be noted that the Tanhuma passage takes the form of a selective reading of an extended biblical story. Thus, one could argue that it is only in such cases that one might assume that the midrash is offering a broad interpretation of the biblical story. In fact, though, Kugel denies that this is the case even when classic interpretive literature takes the form of a retelling of the biblical story.7 I would argue, in contrast, that a midrash may well be offering a broad interpretation of the biblical story even when it takes the form of a comment on an individual word or phrase in the biblical text. When exegetical traditions are woven into a retelling, it makes especially good sense to see what larger reading of the biblical text is being suggested by the retelling, as the retelling can be expected to include traditions that are mutually consistent in relation to their broad understanding of the biblical nar- rative. And, in fact, it is likely that some of the exegetical traditions that appear in a given retelling have their source in the broad reading of the biblical narra- tive that is reflected in that retelling.8 6. Kugel, In Potiphar 's House: The Interpretive Life of Biblical Texts (San Francisco: Harper San Francisco, 1990), 159-72; see 169 nn. 1, 2 for references to the secondary literature. 7. "How does one go about studying the biblical interpretation found in such retellings? Pre- cisely because they tend to incorporate a number of separate, discrete insights into particular verses, the smooth-flowing unity of these retellings is deceptive. All too often in the past, scholars have dealt with things like 'Josephus' Version of the Exodus' as if it were all of a piece, the sustained reflec- tion of a single interpreter contemplating a large chunk of the biblical text. This is misleading on two counts. First, Josephus-like all his predecessors-had his eye on individual verses or even single words or phrases within individual verses. When, therefore, in retelling the story of the exodus or any other biblical narrative, he deviates from what the Bible itself seems to be saying, it is usually because he is expanding upon some little particularity in the narrative" (Kugel, Traditions of the Bible, 24). Kugel's second reason is that the bits of the retelling are exegetical traditions that appear independently in other sources. Thus, the reteller weaves together distinct exegetical traditions in his retelling without offering a broad interpretation of the biblical story (25-27). 8. See, for example, the midrash about Noah inventing the plow and other agricultural tools, which will be discussed later. 327</page><page sequence="4">Devora Steinmetz LEMEKH KILLS KAYIN ... Lemekh was his [Kayin's] descendant, of the seventh generation, and he was blind. He would go out to hunt, and his son would hold him by the hand. When that child would see an animal, he would tell him. He said: "I see some kind of an animal!" He drew the bow toward it, and he killed Kayin. That child saw from afar a killed man and a horn in his forehead. He said to Lemekh: "My father, behold the likeness of a man killed and a horn in his forehead!" Lemekh said to him: "Woe to me; it is my ancestor!" He clapped his two hands in regret and struck the head of the child and killed him accidentally, as it says: ki 'ish haragti lefiz 'i veyeled lehaburati. (Genesis 4:23)9 As the passage suggests, the story that is told by the midrash is most clearly an interpretation of the very difficult speech that Lemekh makes to his wives: ki 'ish haragti lefiz'i veyeled lehaburati... The midrash is taking the poetic parallelism to suggest two different objects of the verb haragti rather than one object phrased two ways. Thus, 'ish and yeled are taken to refer to two different people. The perfect form of the verb haragti is taken to indicate the past tense rather than the alternative of reading Lemekh's words as a boastful threat that he will kill someone. Leaving aside for now how the midrash is construing lefiz 'i and lehaburati,10 the midrash understands Lemekh's words thus: "I have killed a man, Kayin, as well as a child, Tuval-Kayin." Kugel suggests that the solution to the identity of the 'ish as Kayin is suggested by the fact that, to this point, only Kayin has been referred to in the biblical text as an 'ish (4:1),11 as well as by the mention of Kayin in the next part of Lemekh's speech: "If Kayin shall be avenged seven-fold, then Lemekh seventy-seven"12 (Genesis 4:24). The identification of the yeled as Tuval-Kayin, Kugel notes, is related to the 9. Tanhuma Bereshit 11. For parallels in both Jewish and Christian sources, see Kugel, In Potipharr' House, 170 n. 7. 10. See the discussion below and in nn. 41, 52. 11. Kugel, In Potiphar ' House, 162. 12. Kugel, In Potiphar ' House, 161. Kugel sees this identification as "convenient" because it fills in what are perceived as a lacuna in the biblical text-how did Kayin die?--especially given what Kugel assumes to be the unsatisfactory possibility that Kayin died a natural death; see Kugel, In Poti- phar s House, 159, 161-62. An alternative midrashic tradition has Kayin die in the flood; see, for example, Bereshit Rabba 22:12 (ed. Theodore-Albeck, 1:219; subsequent references to Bereshit Rabba refer to this edition). 328</page><page sequence="5">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative mention of Tuval-Kayin in the verse immediately preceding Lemekh's speech (Genesis 4:22). The midrash also addresses other difficult elements of the biblical text. It takes the words shiva 'atayim yukam (Genesis 4:15, 24) as referring to seven gen- erations.13 And it interprets the 'ot that God gives to Kayin (Genesis 4:15) as a horn'4--though notably, according to this midrash, it is Kayin's horn that leads someone to kill him rather than the horn protecting Kayin from being killed.15 Thus, the little story about Lemekh killing Kayin solves a range of exegetical pro- blems, most obviously clearing up difficult or obscure words and phrases in the biblical text while at the same time filling in lacunae (how did Kayin die?) and making sense of repeating marked words (such as 'ish) and the juxtaposition of elements within the biblical telling (such as the mention of Kayin in the continu- ation of Lemekh's speech and the mention of Tuval-Kayin in the verse immedi- ately preceding the speech).16 A READING OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE I think that the midrash is doing more than this, and I want now to focus on the biblical text to see what the midrash might be seeking to find out and how the midrash might be reading the biblical story. My first step will be to offer a reading of the biblical text without reference to the midrash about Kayin and Lemekh.17 I do so with the awareness that extended readings of biblical texts are not the norm for articles about midrash. But the shape of this article parallels the point that I am making-that midrashim should be seen as broad readings of biblical texts and 13. The interpretation of shiv 'atayim as seven generations is common; it occurs, for example, in Bereshit Rabba 23:4 (1:225), the targumim, and Efrem. For the latter two, see nn. 46-47 herein. 14. This is one of several interpretations of the 'ot in Bereshit Rabba 22:12 (1:219). 15. This might account for the motif of Lemekh's blindness. Because God states that the horn is meant to protect Kayin from being killed, there must be an anomalous circumstance to account for the sign's effectiveness being thwarted. The sign is misread by young Tuval-Kayin, who thinks the homed creature in the distance is an animal, whereas Lemekh himself might have been expected to be more careful if he had been sighted because he is aware that Kayin has a horn (note that he immediately ident- ifies the creature described by Tuval-Kayin as Kayin). For an alternative explanation of the origin of the motif of Lemekh's blindness, see Kugel, In Potiphar s House, 162-69. See nn. 51-52 herein for poss- ible symbolic understandings of Lemekh's blindness in relation to the story the midrash is telling and the way that story is interpreting the biblical narrative (as opposed to the explanation offered here, which takes the motif to be necessitated by the plot of the story the midrash is constructing, and Kugel's hypothesis, which suggests that the motif emerges from an exegesis of lefiz 'i and lehaburati). 16. The suggestion that the juxtaposition of verses or the coincidence of words is something the midrash seeks to interpret is my formulation. Kugel might formulate the process somewhat differently, in keeping with his insistence that midrash is concerned with individual words and verses. For Kugel, the main problem that demands midrashic solution is the identification of the 'ish and the yeled; the juxtaposition of the verse with references to Kayin and Tuval-Kayin and the earlier use of the word 'ish in relation to Kayin are not so much literary phenomena that beg for interpretation as opportunities to solve the exegetical problem at hand. 17. The reading that I am offering assumes the literary unity of the biblical text. Regardless of whether that is one's own assumption about the biblical text, it is certainly the assumption on which rabbinic readings of the biblical text are based. 329</page><page sequence="6">Devora Steinmetz that understanding a midrash requires extended engagement with the biblical text on which it is commenting. My starting point is Genesis 4:25: "And Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son, and she called his name Shet 'because God gave'8 me another seed instead of Hevel, because Kayin killed him."' At first reading, this verse seems out of place. If the birth of Shet to Adam and Hava is seen as a response to the death of Hevel,19 then we would expect this verse to appear earlier, perhaps right after Hevel is killed or, so as not to interrupt the flow of the story of Kayin's misdeed, after the verses that describe the consequences of Kayin's act of murder. Instead, though, the verse about Shet's birth comes after the biblical narra- tive has exhausted its treatment of Kayin's family. Thus, Kayin knows his wife and begets Hanokh in 4:17, leading to the sequence of generations down to Lemekh's children, whereas Adam knows Hava and begets Shet only in 4:25. Though this narrative sequence can be explained by the literary preference to continue with the Kayin story before interrupting it to focus again on Adam and Hava, the sequence suggests a reading that sees the narrative report of Shet's birth as related in some way to the events that precede it in the course of the narrative.20 Further, Hava's explanation of Shet's name suggests that the birth of Shet is a response not only to the loss of Hevel but also to something about Kayin. Hava's words "instead of Hevel, because Kayin killed him" can be read to suggest that Shet is not just in place of Hevel, who has been killed, but also in place of Kayin, who committed the murder.21 This reading fits well with the continuation of the biblical narrative, which has Shet begetting Enosh (4:26)--humankind- and goes on to introduce the "book of the generations of Adam" (5:1), which traces the genealogy of Adam through Shet (5:3) rather than through Kayin, to whose genealogy the line of Shet bears striking resemblance. The place of Shet's birth after the genealogy of Kayin, the suggestion that Shet is a replacement for both Hevel and Kayin, and the re-beginning of the 18. Sh-y-t means "to place or put"; shat ii seems best translated as "gave me." Note the trans- lation in most of the targumim as yehav; see A. F. J. Klijn, Seth in Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic Literature (Leiden, UK: Brill, 1977), 33. 19. Additionally, if the narrative sequence were to mirror the chronology-Adam begets Shet at the age of 130 (5:2)-this could hardly have happened at the time of Kayin's seventh generation. In Life ofAdam and Eve, 23:5, Adam is said to be 130 years old when Kayin kills Hevel, a detail that locates the begetting of Shet as an immediate response to the death of Hevel. 20. It bears emphasizing that I am talking about the narrative sequence, not the narrative chron- ology. That is, I am suggesting that, although the narrative chronology would place the birth of Shet earlier, the narrative sequence suggests that Shet's birth is related to the events told before the story of his birth, in the sense that the event of his birth is to be understood in relation to the events that precede it in the narrative. 21. See Bereshit Rabba 23:5 (1:226), "'Instead of Hevel, because Kayin killed him'--through the sin of Hevel, Kayin was killed. Like two trees that were near each other, a wind uprooted one of them and it fell on the other and uprooted it." Cf Midrash Lekah Tov, "It is not enough that Hevel was killed, but Kayin has been banished." 330</page><page sequence="7">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative narrative of the human race with the birth of Shet to Adam leads to the plausibility of reading Shet's birth not only as a response to Kayin's murder of Hevel but as related in particular to the story of Kayin's descendants-which culminates, immediately before the verse about Shet's birth, with Lemekh's speech to his wives, on which our midrash is based. What is it about the story of Kayin's des- cendants, we might ask, that demonstrates the necessity of a child who can replace both Hevel and Kayin as the progenitor of humankind? Or, to put it differently, how does the story of Kayin's descendants demonstrate the impossibility of humankind emerging from Kayin in a way that we might not fully understand simply from reading the story of Kayin's murder of Hevel and its immediate aftermath? To start with, it is noteworthy that the narrative traces Kayin's genealogy through seven generations. If seven is seen as a number of completeness or fulfill- ment, the narrative is following Kayin's family to its culmination. Indeed, the seventh generation of Kayin's genealogy differs from the preceding generations: It is branched as opposed to linear; it yields to a story instead of being limited to a list of names; and it includes an allusion to the number seven as well as to the progenitor of the line-"if Kayin shall be avenged seven-fold"(4:24).22 Thus, the generation of Lemekh's sons is marked as distinctive and related in a special way to Kayin. In addition, the name of Lemekh's youngest son-Tuval-Kayin-recalls the name of the progenitor of the line. Kayin reemerges, then, not only in Lemekh's speech to his wives but also in the name of the son whose birth is described in the verse immediately preceding Lemekh's speech. Strikingly, the other part of Tuval-Kayin's name, as well as the names of his half-brothers, Yaval and Yuval, can be seen as evoking (in sound, though not in meaning) the name of Kayin's brother, Hevel.23 The names of Lemekh's sons, then, are another way in which the final generation of Kayin's genealogy announces its place as the culmination of Kayin's line. Later, I will return to look more closely at the names of Lemekh's sons, but first I want to look at the names of the first brothers and their significance within the narrative to understand the significance of the echoes of these names in the seventh generation. Hava offers an explanation of the name Kayin, as she does for her third son, Shet, later in the narrative:24 "She gave birth to Kayin, and 22. The interpretation of shiv'atayim as "seven generations" (see n. 13 herein) is no doubt related to Lemekh's repetition of shiv'atayim yukam as the line of Kayin reaches the seventh generation. 23. This is noted by Benno Jacob, The First Book of the Bible: Genesis (New York: Ktav, 1974), 38. 24. Note, though, that in the case of Kayin, Hava is not said to have given her son a name, as she does at the birth of Shet. Rather, Hava "gave birth to Kayin, and she said ..." This suggests, perhaps, that Kayin is the embodiment of the quality that Hava demonstrates in her statement kaniti 'ish 'et yhwh. The attribution of Shet's name to Hava, in contrast, suggests that Hava now demonstrates an awareness of her construction of her role in bearing a child and of her role in defining the nature of that child. 331</page><page sequence="8">Devora Steinmetz she said: kaniti 'ish 'et yhwh" (4:1). Hava's words have been an interpretive crux since the earliest times, but this is not the place for a comprehensive review of all of the difficulties involved and the range of interpretations that have been pro- posed.25 It bears noting, though, that standard translations render the preposition 'et as either "with the help of' or "from." The verb kaniti is variously translated as "I have acquired" or "I have produced/brought forth." Thus, for example, the New Revised Standard Version translates this passage as "I have produced a man with the help of the Lord," while the Jerusalem Bible translates it as "I have acquired a manchildfrom the Lord." Although the two translations of the verb are different, both renderings of the preposition suggest that Hava is putting herself in a subordinate position to God. The word 'et, though, functions either as a direct object marker or as the pre- position "with." It never means "from." Because Hava's statement is difficult to construe with "the Lord" as the direct object, we are left with 'et meaning "with."26 "With the help of," the standard alternative to "from" in translations of this difficult passage, is an interpretation of "with,"27 but one that radically changes the meaning. "With the help of' suggests limitation and dependency, whereas "with," in contrast, suggests partnership. Once we take 'et to mean "with," the likely meaning of kaniti is "I have pro- duced/created." The verb can mean "to acquire" as well as "to create." If Hava is saying that she has done something together with God, it is most reasonable to understand her as saying that she has created a person together with God.28 Thus, the statement from which the narrative suggests that Kayin's name is derived sets up Hava as co-creator with God.29 Until now, God has created things; now, Hava creates in partnership with God.30 Kayin is the embodiment of Hava's understanding of herself as a partner with God in creation. 25. For a summary of ancient, medieval, and modem renderings of the word 'et, see Umberto Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis: From Adam to Noah (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1941), 199. For a brief summary of the difficulties inherent in Hava's statement and some possible solutions, see Gordon J. Wenham, Word Biblical Commentary, I: Genesis 1-15 (Waco, TX: Word Books, 1987), 101-102. 26. In Bereshit Rabba 22:2 (1:206), Rabbi Akiva argues that 'et shows that "the Lord" should not be taken as the direct object, whereas the interpretation of R. Yishma'el that follows clearly takes 'et to mean "with." See Nahum Sarna, The JPS Torah Commentary: Genesis (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989), 32, on 'et as connoting "together with" in this verse. 27. As Gerhard von Rad notes in Genesis: A Commentary (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1972), 103, "otherwise 'it never means 'with the help of.'" 28. For God as the subject of the verb k-n-h, see Genesis 14:19, 22; Cassuto (From Adam to Noah, 197) also points to Deuteronomy 32:6 (note the parallel to '-s-h), Psalms 139:13, and Proverbs 8:22. 29. The actual etymology of the name Kayin is not the issue here; the issue is the significance that the narrative attributes to the name, as well as how an ancient reader of the biblical text would have construed the relationship between the name Kayin and the word kaniti. Note, nonetheless, Cassuto's argument that, although the two words stem from different roots, both signify "to form" (From Adam to Noah, 201). See also Sarna, The JPS Torah Commentary, 32. 30. The interpretation of Hava's statement offered here corresponds closely with Cassuto's interpretation, though Cassuto understands Hava as presenting herself as an equal to God as 332</page><page sequence="9">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative The name Hevel, unlike Kayin, does not come with an explanation. As many have noted, however, the name means "breath" and no doubt relates to the fleetingness of Hevel's life, a meaning that is disclosed only as the story pro- gresses. In addition, the meaning of the name Hevel stands in sharp contrast with the meaning of the name Kayin that has been suggested here. If Kayin connotes creativity or productivity-the bringing forth of substance into the world- Hevel suggests that which is insubstantial and ephemeral. The different qualities implied by the names of the two brothers can be read as corresponding to the brothers' respective activities: their professions, their sacrifices, and even Kayin's crime and its aftermath. Kayin is a worker of the ground, whereas Hevel is a keeper of sheep.3 A farmer's labor brings forth from the soil something that was not there before,32 whereas a shepherd watches over and cares for what is already there. Kayin, who takes the initiative in bringing a sacrifice,33 brings "of the fruit of the ground" (4:3), whereas Hevel brings the firstborn and fat parts of the sheep creator--in the sense that God created the first man and she created the second-rather than as a partner with God in the creation of Kayin (From Adam to Noah, 197-201). 31. It is interesting to consider the occupations of the brothers in relation to the enigmatic le 'avdah ulshamrah of Genesis 2:15. Kayin is an 'oved 'adama (4:2), whereas Hevel's job is to watch over the sheep, though sh-m-r is not used in relation to Hevel's occupation (the word is used in relation to shep- herding in Genesis 30:31--thus, Jacob is both an 'oved [31:41 and numerous other times within this story] and a shomer). Notably, not only is Kayin not one who watches, but also he will deny that it is his job is to watch over things: hashomer 'ahi 'anokhi (4:9). (Pirke Rabbi Eliezer may be addressing the connection between Kayin's statement and le 'avdah ulshamrah, as it has Kayin saying to God, "You have [not] made me shomer of vineyard and field; you have not made me shomer of my brother." Manuscripts differ as to whether Kayin is saying that he is or is not a shomer of vineyard and field. See Michael Higger, "Pirke Rabbi Eliezer," Horev 9 (1946): 143. In Pirke Rabbi Eliezer, Kayin has buried his brother's body in the field.) In the case of Adam as well, '-v-d is used, but sh-m- r is not. In fact, the two words are juxtaposed, as Adam is sent out of the garden "to work the ground from which he was taken," (3:23) and the keruvim are placed before the garden "to guard the way to the tree of life" (3:24). The implication, perhaps, is that Adam cannot be relied on lishmor, as, in fact, he did not keep himself from the fruit of the tree of knowledge (3:22). Kayin's occupation of 'oved adama is mentioned just a few verses later and seems clearly to be a fulfillment of God's plan for Adam in 3:23. Thus, both Adam and Kayin do 'avoda but fail to do shemira. The possible implications of this for an understanding of le 'avdah ulshamrah remain to be worked out. 32. In the story of human creation in Genesis 2, even the person is shaped from the ground (2:7). (In Genesis 1, land creatures are brought out from the earth on day six [1:12], just as vegetation is brought out from the earth on day three [1:24].) It is to the ground that Adam is told he will return, "for from it you were taken" (3:19), in a passage that talks about the ground issuing forth the vegetation that Adam needs for his sustenance (3:17-18). And it is the ground that will "open its mouth" to take back the blood of Hevel (4:11). Thus, there is a parallel between the creation of human beings from the ground (and the return of human beings to the ground at their death) and the bringing forth of produce from the ground. See also "to work the ground from which he was taken" (2:23), in which working the ground and the creation of human beings from the ground are juxtaposed in a verse that sets the stage for the occupation of Kayin (see n. 31 herein). 33. Ziony Zevit, The Anterior Construction in Classical Hebrew (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1998), 23, argues that hevi' should be understood as "had brought." This seems highly unlikely to me, 333</page><page sequence="10">Devora Steinmetz (4:4). The contrast between the brothers' offerings has been noted since ancient times.34 Whereas Hevel brings choice gifts-those animals and parts of animals that biblical law mandates must be sacrificed to God35-there is no indication that Kayin does the same. Kayin brings "of the fruit of the ground"-apparently, representative samples of his produce rather than first or choice fruits. Kayin's sacrifice, though, corresponds well to the stance that I have suggested gives Kayin his name and corresponds to Kayin's profession. If Kayin embodies the understanding of a person as a partner with God in creation, as Hava presents herself in the statement with which the story explains Kayin's name, then sharing one's produce with God makes perfect sense. Giving God's one's first and choicest, though, represents a very different stance, one in which the person sees himself as a beneficiary of God's gifts. Hevel, the brother who does not create, gives God gifts that are a recognition of his dependence on God as the creator who allows people the use of his creation. Kayin, the brother who creates, shares with his co-creator the fruits of his labor. Kayin's crime, too, can be seen in relation to the stance of creator. One who sees himself as creator of life can destroy life. Shedding the blood of Hevel, which the ground is forced to take back (4:11), is the flip side of bringing forth life as a worker of the ground.36 And Kayin demonstrates initiative, creativity, and partner- ship with God even in his conversation with God concerning his fate, as he rede- fines the consequences of his sin (4:14; cp. 4:11-12) and reshapes his fate, settling in the land of Nod and building a city (4:16-17) rather than being na' vanad (4:12).37 Kayin founds civilization, and his descendants, Lemekh's sons, found animal husbandry, the arts, and technology. I noted earlier that Yaval, Yuval, and Tuval might evoke the name Hevel, whereas the second part of Tuval-Kayin's especially in light of the words gam hu '. The perfect form of the verb is better explained here as a formal contrast with the preceding imperfect (as in 4:2) for stylistic variation; see Cassuto, From Adam to Noah, 27, for this explanation and for other examples of the same verb occurring twice within a verse, the first time in the imperfect and the second time in the perfect. 34. The idea that Kayin brought leftovers or poor-quality produce is commonplace in midrashic literature (see, for example, Tanhuma Bereshit 9); leftovers and poor-quality produce are the antitheses of firstborn and fat parts, respectively. Although Kayin could simply be seen as bringing representative samples of his produce, as I will suggest, these midrashim emphasize the distinction between the broth- ers' sacrifices. 35. See Wenham, Word Biblical Commentary, 103, for biblical sources relating to firstlings and the fat and for references to modem scholarship on Hevel's sacrifice. 36. See n. 32 herein on the parallel between human life and vegetation and between creation from the ground and the return of the dead to the ground. Note, too, Genesis 4:11-12: Because Kayin forced the ground to take his dead brother, it will no longer give its force to Kayin in bringing forth produce; henceforth, Kayin will be a wanderer, not a settled 'oved 'adama. 37. For a discussion of these points, see Devora Steinmetz, "Vineyard, Farm, and Garden: The Drunkenness of Noah in the Context of Primeval History," Journal of Biblical Literature 113 (1994), 193-207. The connection between Nod and na ' vanad was noted in classic midrashim, which see Kayin as convincing God to mitigate his punishment halfway. See, for example, Tanhuma Bereshit 9 and the more explicit parallel in Tanhuma (ed. Buber) 26. 334</page><page sequence="11">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative name is identical to that of the progenitor of this line. But what is striking is that the names Yaval, Yuval, and Tuval seem to stem from the root y-v-l, connoting produce or yield.38 This meaning corresponds well with the notice that each of these brothers creates a new element of civilization.39 In Kayin's line, one could say, even the insubstantiality of Hevel is transformed into productivity! But it is at the moment that Kayin's line reaches fulfillment in the seventh generation, when Kayin reemerges in Tuval-Kayin and when the brothers of this namesake of Kayin each demonstrate their own form of creativity, that destructiveness emerges again. Tuval-Kayin is a smith (4:22).40 Many kinds of tools, of course, can be made from copper and iron, but Lemekh's speech in the very next verse suggests that the new technology of metallurgy has enabled human beings to kill.41 Killing now is portrayed as generating even more destruc- tiveness in its wake: "If Kayin shall be avenged seven-fold, then Lemekh seventy- seven" (4:24). It is at this moment that we hear of the birth of Shet. The narrative has traced the line of Kayin through seven generations. Kayin, I have suggested, embodies the qualities of creativity, productivity, and initiative, surely qualities that are essential in establishing human culture and civilization. But I have suggested as well that the creativity that Kayin embodies is a kind of creativity in which the person takes a stance as co-creator with God rather than a creature who is sub- ordinate to God. It is this very stance, I have argued, that leads to Kayin's downfall-to the failure of his sacrifice and to his murder of his brother. Yet Kayin recreates himself as well, settling down to have a family and build the first city. The question that needs to be answered is whether Kayin can be the progenitor of humankind. The narrative tracing of Kayin's line to completion culminating in the birth of Lemekh's sons, in Tuval-Kayin's invention of metal- lurgy, and in Lemekh's boast of exponential destruction-is what demonstrates the impossibility of humankind emerging from Kayin. Creativity and murder go hand in hand in this civilization, and such a race of human beings must ultimately self-destruct. It is now that we understand that Adam and Hava need to bear a third child, a child from whom humankind can emerge. That child is Shet. We are now back at our starting point: "And Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son, and she called his name Shet 'because God gave me another seed instead of Hevel, because Kayin killed him"' (4:25). Shet's name, like 38. See Cassuto, From Adam to Noah, 235; and Wenham, Word Biblical Commentary, 112. 39. Wenham, Word Biblical Commentary, 112, connects the meaning of the names to the broth- ers' "inventiveness." 40. The exact meaning of lotesh kol horesh nehoshet uvarzel is unclear; see the brief summary in Wenham, Word Biblical Commentary, 113-14. 41. The meaning of Lemekh's words in 4:23 is unclear. Lemekh can be understood as boasting about something that he has done or as making a threat about what he might do. The preposition le- is also unclear, as is the possessive pronoun: Does lefiz 'i suggest that Lemekh talks of killing in return for a wound that he has received ("my wound" = a wound inflicted on me), or does it suggest that Lemekh talks of killing by means ofinflicting a wound ("my wound"= a wound inflicted by me)? (See Kugel) If it is the latter, then there might be a suggestion that the new technology of metallurgy has enabled one to kill by the mere infliction of a wound. In Potiphar s House, 166-67. 335</page><page sequence="12">Devora Steinmetz Kayin's, is given an explanation, and in fact, the two explanations are similar-in both, Hava talks about how the child came into being, and she talks about herself and God in this process. But the explanations are radically different. At the birth of her first son, Hava says, "I have created a man together with the Lord." I argued earlier that Hava sees herself as co-creator with God of this new creature, Kayin. But now, Hava presents herself as the recipient of God's gift.42 If, as I have suggested, we see the destructiveness that emerges from Kayin and his line as integrally connected to the stance of human being as co-creator with God, then Hava's words at Shet's birth suggest that this new child represents a very different stance of the human being in relation to God and God's world.43 Shet, then, as Hava's words suggest, is not only in place of Hevel, who has been killed, but in place of Kayin, who has killed and who, we now know, gives rise to a line that culminates in the anticipation of increasing destructiveness. In fact, the line of Shet closely resembles the line of Kayin, with names that we have encountered in Kayin's genealogy reappearing, with small changes, in the genealogy of Adam through Shet (the names in italic are the only ones that do not appear in both lists): Adam Adam Kayin Shet Hanokh 'Enosh 'Irad Kenan Mehuya'el/Mehiya'el Mahalal'el Metusha'el Yered Lemekh Hanokh Metushelah Lemekh Noah Kenan corresponds to Kayin; Mahalal'el to Mehuya'el/Mehiya'el; Yered to 'Irad; Metushelah to Metusha'el. Hanokh appears in both genealogies, as does Lemekh. Thus, each of the six generations after Adam in Kayin's line has an echo in the line of Adam through Shet. Shet, of course, has no parallel in Kayin's line, as his name represents the difference between his line and the line of Kayin, and the name 'Enosh signifies that humankind emerges from Shet.44 42. This critical difference is obscured in standard translations of Hava's remarks at Kayin's birth, especially those that translate "I have acquired a manchild from the Lord," which has Hava acknowledging God's gift to her at Kayin's birth, much as she does later at the birth of Shet. 43. This shift in stance may also be reflected in the different names for God used by Hava in the two statements. In the first, she uses the Tetragrammaton, which can be understood as representing God in relationship with human beings, whereas in the second, she uses 'elohim, which can be understood to present God as transcendent. The interpretation offered here of the difference between Hava's remarks at the birth of her two sons corresponds to Cassuto's interpretation; see From Adam to Noah, 245-46. 44. Shet's name can also be understood to suggest the idea of establishing the human race; see Klijn, Seth, 33-34 for Jewish and Christian sources that understand Shet's name as connoting "foun- dation" (and compare the 'even shetiya, the foundation stone of the world, in rabbinic texts). 336</page><page sequence="13">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative The place of Noah in the second genealogy is more complex. On the one hand, Noah is tenth in line from Adam, paralleling Lemekh's place as seventh in line from Adam in the first genealogy, if we see the two genealogies as based on the numbers seven and ten, respectively. Noah and Lemekh (I) appear last in the linear portion of their respective genealogies; after these figures, the genealogies branch out, as each of these figures begets three sons, at which point the genealogy breaks off and gives way to narrative. On the other hand, clearly there is a parallel between the two Lemekhs, which places Noah instead as parallel with the sons of Lemekh (I).45 In particular, if we note that Tuval-Kayin is the tenth in Adam's line through Kayin, we might see Noah as specifically paralleling Tuval-Kayin. I will return to Noah's place in the second genealogy in relation to the first later, but for now, I want to address the significance of the similarity of names in the two genealogies. On one hand, we might see the similarity of names as under- scoring the idea that this second line-the line of Adam through Shet-replaces the line of Kayin, as I have argued that Hava's statement suggests. On the other hand, the similarity of names might suggest that there is something about the line of Kayin that the narrative is saying should be retained. These possibilities, of course, are not mutually exclusive. We can read the narrative as acknowledging the positive quality of Kayin while recognizing the excess that leads to destruc- tiveness. The names in the line of Shet might be saying that Shet does not sub- stitute for Kayin in the sense that Kayin is totally rejected but in the sense of retaining that which allows civilization to exist, though changing things enough to allow for the possibility of humankind to emerge and sustain itself rather than self-destruct. In sum, the reading that I have offered here suggests that Lemekh's speech has an important place in the narrative, marking the shift from the line of Kayin to the line of Shet and explaining why that shift is necessary. Lemekh's speech comes at the culmination of the line of Kayin in the birth of Lemekh and his children, and it seems to relate particularly to the innovations of Tuval-Kayin, the last son men- tioned before Lemekh's speech and the son whose name incorporates the name of the progenitor of the line. I have suggested that Lemekh's speech, with its notice of increasing violence, culminates the narrative's playing out of the potential for destructiveness that is inherent in the human stance of co-creator with God. It is at this point that the line of Kayin must drop out of the narrative's tale of the begin- ning of humankind, to be replaced by a new line that represents a different stance in relation to God. I want to return now to the midrash with which we began. This time, I will quote selections from the longer passage in which the story about Lemekh killing Kayin is embedded in the Tanhuma. 45. Note, in addition to the identity of their names, that Lemekh (II) lives 777 years (5:33), while Lemekh (I), the seventh in line from Adam, mentions the numbers seven and seventy-seven in his speech to his wives. 337</page><page sequence="14">Devora Steinmetz THE MIDRASH "And the Lord said to him: Therefore whoever kills Kayin... ."(Genesis 4:15) He said to him: Four generations were to come from Hevel, and you eliminated them from the world; so too the earth will open its mouth and swallow for you four families. These are Hanokh, 'Irad, and Mehuya'el, and Metusha'el. And how was Kayin killed? ... Lemekh was his [Kayin's] descendant, of the seventh generation, and he was blind. He would go out to hunt, and his son would hold him by the hand. When that child would see an animal, he would tell him. He said: "I see some kind of an animal!" He drew the bow toward it, and he killed Kayin. That child saw from afar a killed man and a horn in his forehead. He said to Lemekh: "My father, behold the likeness of a man killed and a horn in his forehead!" Lemekh said to him: "Woe to me; it is my ancestor!" He clapped his two hands in regret and struck the head of the child and killed him accidentally, as it says: ki 'ish haragti lefiz'i veyeled lehaburati. (Genesis 4:23) The three of them remained in one place: Kayin killed, and that child killed, and Lemekh blind. Toward evening, his wives went out after him. They found their ancestor killed, and Tuval-Kayin their son killed, and Lemekh. At that moment, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed four families: Hanokh and 'Irad and Mehuya'el and Metusha'el ... fulfilling that which it says: "IfKayin shall be avenged seven-fold, then Lemekh seventy-seven."

(Genesis 5:29) ... and what does "from our deeds and from the suffering of our hands" (5:29) mean?... . until Noah was born, people did labor with their hands; thus it says "from the suffering of our hands." Noah was born and he established for them plows and scythes and spades and all tools of labor. This extended midrash does indeed offer solutions to a range of surface exegetical difficulties in the biblical text. As already noted, the midrash offers a solution to 339</page><page sequence="16">Devora Steinmetz the identity of the 'ish and the yeled, interpreting them as two different figures- Lemekh has killed both his ancestor, Kayin, and his young son, Tuval-Kayin. Also, as already noted, the midrash understands shiv'atayim as meaning seven generations, referring to the seven generations from Kayin through Lemekh's children. The interpretation of shiv'atayim as referring to seven generations, though, seems to have a double meaning here. On one hand, Kayin's punishment is deferred for seven generations,46 as Lemekh points out to his wives when he tries to assure them that his own punishment will be deferred for seventy-seven generations. On the other hand, Kayin's punishment also takes the form of the destruction of seven generations; thus, Kayin is punished sevenfold.47 The implications for Lemekh's family, then, are hardly reassuring, as Ada and Zila are well aware: "Why should we give birth for a curse?"48 The midrash might also be attempting to reconcile the two verses that talk about vengeance in the biblical story: "whoever kills Kayin, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold" (4:15) and "vengeance shall be taken on Kayin seven- fold" (4:24). The first verse seems to be talking about Kayin's killer as the object of vengeance, whereas the second seems to be talking about Kayin himself as the object of vengeance.49 The story told by this midrash allows for both of these to happen because the particular form of vengeance renders the 46. For a discussion of this interpretation as it appears in the targumim, see Geza Vermes, "The Targumic Version of Genesis IV 3-16," Annual of Leeds University Oriental Society 3 (1961-62), 81-114, esp. 104-105. See n. 47 herein. 47. Efrem brings both interpretations-that Kayin's punishment is delayed for seven gener- ations and that seven generations of Kayin's line will be destroyed-though he disagrees with the latter interpretation. See Collected Prose Works/St. Ephrem the Syrian, trans. Edward G. Mathews, Jr., and Joseph P. Amar, ed. Kathleen McVey (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1994), 128-29. For Efrem, the delayed punishment is not a benefit; rather, Kayin suffers pro- longed punishment, as seven generations see his lowly state. Vermes ("The Targumic Version," 104-105) discusses the possibility that this interpretation, which also occurs in Jerome, is reflected in Targum Onkelos. See also The Armenian Commentary on Genesis Attributed to Ephrem the Syrian, trans. Edward G. Mathews, Jr. (Lovanii: In Aedibus Peeters, 1988), 48-57. 48. According to the Jewish interpretation cited by Jerome, seventy-seven descendants of Lemekh died in the flood; see Louis Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, vol. 5 (Philadelphia: Jewish Pub- lication Society, 1925), 144. In Midrash Lekah Tov, the curse that Ada and Zila anticipate is that their future children will die in the flood. 49. Various ways of parsing 4:15 attempt to address this problem. Targum Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan take shiv'atayim as modifying horeg rather than yukam (see Vermes' translations in "The Targumic Versions"); thus, the verse is saying that whoever kills Kayin over the course of seven generations shall be punished. (This interpretation fits with the understanding that the verse is talking about a delay in Kayin's own punishment-his punishment will come only after seven gener- ations, and thus no one may kill him before that. Cf. Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan to 4:24.) This reading leaves yukam in 4:15 and 4:24 as referring to two different people (Kayin's potential killer and Kayin himself), but it salvages shiv'atayim as referring to the delay in Kayin's punishment in both verses. Rashi, in contrast, interprets shiv'atayim as modifying yukam but reads God's words in this verse as a shorthand for two separate statements: "Therefore, anyone who kills Kayin [such and such will be done to him]"-that is, no one may kill Kayin-and "Kayin will be avenged after seven generations." This interpretation allows shiv'atayim yukam in 4:15 to refer to Kayin, as it does in 4:24. 340</page><page sequence="17">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative two identical-Kayin's loss of seven generations is also, of course, Lemekh's loss of seven generations. Thus, the killer of Kayin suffers the same sevenfold loss as does Kayin himself. In addition to the difficulties already discussed, the extended midrash addresses other surface problems. For example, the midrash explains Lemekh's purpose in addressing his wives-he is trying to convince his wives to sleep with him. Lemekh's apparent address of his wives as "the wives of Lemekh," in which Lemekh seems to refer to himself in the third person, is interpreted by the midrash as spoken, instead, by Adam. And the very difficult ki 'ish haragti lefiz 'i is interpreted by the midrash as a rhetorical question: Did I kill Kayin by intentionally inflicting a wound? But the story that the midrash tells is not just a weaving together of disparate solutions to each of these local exegetical problems. Rather, the story that the midrash tells should be seen as reflecting the midrash's broad reading of the bib- lical narrative. And the particular answers that the midrash offers to the local exe- getical problems should be seen as emerging from and reflecting the midrash's broad reading of the narrative rather than as focusing exclusively on solving each of the local problems at hand. In other words, I am suggesting a reversal of the standard way of understanding midrash's exegetical function. The norm is to see midrash's exegetical project as focused on answering individual surface problems, with midrashic stories, such as the one being discussed here, viewed as just one of a number of ways that midrashic texts organize and present what really should be seen as discrete exegetical units. Instead, I am suggesting that the starting point of midrash is often a broader reading of the biblical text, and that it is this broad reading that generates the particular answers to local exegetical problems. It bears emphasizing that the broad midrashic reading itself emerges from engagement with exegetical questions as well as with a range of literary phenomena, such as narrative structure, repeating or echoing words, common or contrasting motifs, and many others. For example, in our case, the midrashic reader notes the kinds of problems that Kugel points out, such as the obscure referent(s) of Lemekh's speech, as well as difficulties that go beyond the verse, such as the placement of the notice of Shet's birth after the list of Kayin's descendants. And, I am arguing, the midrashist also notes phenomena such as the structurally parallel genealogies of Kayin and Shet, the repetition of similar names in the two genealogies (as well as the echoes in the children of Lemekh of the names of the first brothers), and the similar but contrasting explanations of the names of Kayin and Shet. My characterization of the starting point of midrash as a broad reading of the biblical text should not be misunderstood as a claim that the midrashic project is divorced from exegesis. Rather, I am arguing that the exegetical project of aggadic midrash is often concerned with the broader biblical narrative and that specific answers to individual exegetical questions take shape in relation to the broad interpretation that emerges from engagement with the range of literary features and exegetical questions that the reader encounters in the biblical narrative. As I suggested earlier, I would argue that this is often the case even when midrashic texts present exegeses as discrete units, although in such cases it is 341</page><page sequence="18">Devora Steinmetz up to the reader of midrash to tease apart competing broad interpretations that may be reflected in different exegeses. But, in cases in which the midrash presents its exegesis in the form of a story, we have every reason to assume that the particular solutions to exegetical problems included in the midrashic story share a common broad interpretation of the biblical narrative. So let's return to the story that this midrash is telling-not to the details of the story but to the story behind the story. What story is the midrash telling in its tale of the blind hunter who kills his ancestor and his son and goes on to appeal to his wives to have sex with him? The story that the midrash is telling is the story of the destruction of the line of Kayin in the seventh generation. In the story of the midrash, past and future come to an end together as the whole family collapses; Lemekh kills Kayin and Tuval-Kayin, and the intervening generations are swal- lowed by the ground that was forced to take the blood of Hevel from Kayin's hand. Humankind cannot continue from this line; Lemekh's wives refuse to sleep with him50 and to bear children who are doomed to destruction.51 Instead, Adam begets a child from whose line Noah will emerge; Noah is the one "from whom the world was created." The story that the midrash tells-again, not the detailed events of the tale but the story that is reflected in those details-is the story that is reflected in the reading of the biblical narrative that I offered. I am not, of course, suggesting that the midrash necessarily shares each element of the interpretation that I offered. I am suggesting, rather, that the broad contours of the midrash's reading of the biblical narrative coincide with the broad contours of the reading that I presented. The detailed interpretation that I offered is intended to demon- strate how such a broad reading might emerge from an encounter with the biblical text, without suggesting that agreement with each detail is necessary for that broad reading to emerge. The critical point is that the reading I offered sees Lemekh's speech as marking the culmination of the line of Kayin and as demonstrating the necessity of the replacement of this line with a new line that will give rise to humankind. This is the reading that is embedded in the midrash, which reads Lemekh's speech as talking about the destruction of the generations from Kayin through Tuval-Kayin, the impossibility of a future through this line, and the need for Adam to beget another child through whom the world can be recreated. The detail with which the midrash ends gives additional support to my argument that the midrash emerges from this broad reading of the biblical narra- tive. The midrash ends with the claim that Noah invented the plow and other agricultural tools, saving humankind from the curse of the earth. I noted earlier that Noah's place within the genealogy of Shet bears parallels both to the place 50. Interestingly, Ada and Zila's words, lo' na 'ale, as well as the fate of the four generations between Kayin and Lemekh, patha ha 'arez piha uval'a, both appear in the story of Korach; see Numbers 16:12 (lo' na 'ale) and 32 (vatiftah ha 'arez 'et piha vativla ). 51. Could the motifof Lemekh's blindness be related to his inability to beget children, blindness serving as a metaphor for castration? Note Ada and Zila's challenge to Adam, who has "separated from his bed," to "heal your lameness." Although the midrash might well be using a common saying (compare Luke 4:23), the reference to lameness in this context suggests impaired generative power. 342</page><page sequence="19">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative of Lemekh and to the place of Tuval-Kayin within the genealogy of Kayin. The midrashic attribution of the introduction of the plow to Noah picks up on these parallels. Tuval-Kayin introduces metallurgy, and I suggested previously that we can see Lemekh's boast as directly related to his youngest son's invention of metal tools. The midrash that has Noah inventing the plow sets up Noah's activities in direct opposition to those of Tuval-Kayin and Lemekh. Tuval-Kayin's tools, the midrash suggests, are used to destroy,52 and leading to life being swallowed up by the ground, as the blood of the first brother is taken back by the ground.53 But Noah invents tools that are used to bring forth life from the ground, reversing the curses in the wake first of Adam's54 and then Kayin's misdeeds.55 Once again, the midrashic detail about Noah's invention of agricultural tools does not simply answer the local exegetical question about the meaning of Noah bringing comfort "from our deeds and from the suffering of our hands, from the ground which the Lord has cursed" (5:29). The midrash, rather, is extending its reading of Lemekh's speech as sealing the fate of Kayin's line and its understand- ing of Shet's line as the necessary replacement of the line of Kayin that culminated in the birth of Tuval-Kayin.56 It is from Noah that the world is created, says the 52. This is so even though the midrash presents Lemekh as killing accidentally. While the midrash takes ki 'ish haragti lefiz 'i as a rhetorical question-did I kill a man by intentionally inflicting a wound?-it suggests that one can indeed now kill merely by means of inflicting a wound. The use of a bow and arrow, the weapon that the midrash puts into Lemekh's hands, allows one to kill from afar, where it can be difficult to see one's victim (for the connection between the bow and not seeing, see Genesis 21:16-I am indebted to Zvi Grumet for this insight into the Genesis verse). That the technology of weapons allows for a new kind of impersonal or "blind" killing might offer another possible explanation for the motif of Lemekh's blindness. 53. Compare the interpretation of Tuval-Kayin's name in Bereshit Rabba 23:3 (1:224): "This one improved on (tibel) the sin of Kayin: Kayin killed but he didn't have with what to kill, but this one 'sharpens every tool"' (Genesis 4:22). In Midrash Lekah Tov, Tuval-Kayin "sharpens every tool of bronze and implement of war." 54. Some classical and modem commentators have noted that Noah, according to the chronology of Adam's genealogy, is the first person born after Adam's death; see, for example, Rashbam on Genesis 5:29 and Sama, The JPS Torah Commentary, 44. If the words 'ad shuvkha 'el ha'adama (Genesis 3:19) are understood to suggest that the curse will last (only) throughout Adam's lifetime, then Noah would be the first person born after the termination of the curse. 55. Cassuto (From Adam to Noah, 289) argues that Genesis 5:29 refers both to the curse imposed on the ground in the aftermath of Adam's disobedience (3:17) and to the curse imposed on Kayin in relation to the earth after the murder of Hevel (4:11). Genesis 5:29 suggests that it is the ground that is cursed, as it is in the Adam story, but also uses the phrase min ha'adama, which occurs in relation to Kayin. 56. Note the midrashic tradition that identifies the wife of Noah as Na'ama, the sister of Tuval- Kayin. This tradition, like the tradition about Noah inventing the plow, links Noah with Tuval-Kayin. The idea that Tuval-Kayin's sister is married to Noah, though, suggests that Shet's line replaces Kayin's in the second of the two ways discussed earlier-that this new line incorporates the positive elements of Kayin's line. Thus, the new world that Noah begins comes from the line of Shet but includes the good from the line of Kayin--the name Na'ama, no doubt, suggests to the midrash the good that is to be salvaged from this family. An alternative and probably derivative tradition sees Noah's wife as a different Na'ama and see Tuval-Kayin's sister as evil. For example, one tradition sees Na'ama as the 343</page><page sequence="20">Devora Steinmetz midrash, and Noah undoes the curse-not only the curses imposed during Adam's and Kayin's times but also the destructiveness that comes upon the earth with the introduction of tools in the time of Tuval-Kayin and Lemekh, the destructiveness that ends the line of Kayin.57 CONCLUSION This article has focused on a single midrash with the goal of demonstrating that midrashim can be read as broad interpretations of the biblical narrative. Of course, I am not arguing that all midrashim are equally interpretive in this sense. Nor do I want to imply, by focusing exclusively on the exegetical aspect of midrash, that midrash develops in isolation from sociocultural context.58 My point, rather, in focusing on the exegetical function of midrash, is to question the prevailing notion that that function is limited to responses to surface problems and that midrash should be seen as addressing the biblical text atomistically. The particular midrash that I chose is, in fact, a rather modest example of midrash as offering a broad reading of the biblical text, because the midrash focuses on only a modestly extended biblical narrative. One could certainly offer examples of midrash as offering a reading of a much more extended woman with whom the benei 'elohim slept (Genesis 6:2), thus bringing new destruction into the world. This second tradition corresponds with the first interpretation of Shet's line as a replacement as Kayin's discussed above-that this new line takes the place of the line that has been shown to be unredeemable. For the two traditions about the identity of Noah's wife, see Bereshit Rabba 23:3 and the note in Theodore-Albeck's edition (1:224) about other traditions concerning Na'ama. 57. It is interesting that Sefer HaYashar has Kayin kill Hevel with the iron part of the plow. This midrash both has Kayin anticipating the toolmaking of his descendant Tuval-Kayin and using tools that can bring life from the ground in order to destroy life and return the human being to the ground. In a sense, this midrash inverts the reversal of the curse that Tanhuma attributes to Noah. Noah's invention of the plow, I have argued, is the midrash's way of showing that Noah, the descendant of Shet, replaces the line of Kayin that culminates in Lemekh and Tuval-Kayin, user and forger of weapons of destruc- tion. Kayin's use of the plow to kill ties Kayin to Lemekh and Tuval-Kayin and suggests that the pro- ductivity of Kayin and his descendants is integrally related to their destructiveness. Though the idea that Kayin kills with a plow does not appear in Tanhuma and the idea that Noah invents the plow does not appear in Sefer HaYashar, I am suggesting that the motif of the plow emerges in both of these midra- shim in relation to the story of Tuval-Kayin and Lemekh: In Sefer Ha Yashar, Kayin anticipates the use of tools for destruction, bringing the curse, whereas in Tanhuma, Noah introduces the use of tools for productivity, undoing the curse. The tradition in Sefer Ha Yashar might have developed in relation to the end-of-days prophecy of Isaiah 2:4: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares." Kayin, at the beginning of human history, uses his plow as a sword! 58. What Fraade calls "the hermeneuticist fallacy," the "tendency... to view hermeneutical prac- tice as if conducted within a sociohistorical isolation booth" (From Tradition to Commentary, 14). Midrash scholarship that focuses on hermeneutics has tended to draw criticism for ignoring historical context; see, for example, the reviews of Daniel Boyarin's Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990) by Martin Jaffee, "The Hermeneutical Model of Mid- rashic Studies: What It Reveals and What It Conceals," Prooftexts 11 (1991): 67-76, and Richard S. Sarason, Journal of Religion 74 (1994): 426-27. 344</page><page sequence="21">Beyond the Verse: Midrash Aggadah as Interpretation of Biblical Narrative narrative.59 I chose this particular midrash, though, for several reasons. First, this midrash clearly addresses a host of difficult local exegetical problems, and it can well be read as an elegant collection of discrete solutions to such problems. Furthermore, this midrash is discussed extensively by Kugel, who, while a strong advocate of the exegetical function of midrash, stresses the local, atomistic nature of midrashic exegesis. Kugel explains this midrash solely as responding to surface exegetical difficulties, and he denies the notion that even midrashim that weave discrete exegeses into stories should be seen as incorporating a broad interpretation of the biblical text. A midrash that has been explained as exclusively exegetical in the narrow sense seemed to offer fertile ground on which to challenge that approach by presenting an alternative understanding of midrashic exegesis. Finally, the relatively focused nature of this midrash's broad reading-on the biblical narrative from Adam and Kayin through Noah-as well as the fact that the midrash itself takes the form of a story about the key figures in this narrative, makes it simpler to present a reading of the biblical narrative that the midrash is addressing and to demonstrate the claim that the midrash is telling the very same story that is reflected in that reading. My hope is that this rather modest example will encourage students of midrash to include the consideration of midrashim as broad interpretations of biblical narrative in their approaches to midrashic texts.
