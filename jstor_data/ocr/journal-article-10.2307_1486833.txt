Semitic Texts and Studies 1. Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992. 183 pp. It is well known that the study of Jewish magic remains in its infancy. It is somewhat less well recognized that study of the Genizah's original religious compositions--unlike the work on its voluminous documentary and rabbinic materials-likewise is still quite undeveloped. Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts fronm the Cairo Genizah: Selected Texts from Taylor-Schechter Box K1 is a major contribution to both these nascent areas of inquiry. Fourteen incantation texts, mostly amulets-a representative sampling of the much larger total-are made accessible here. They are framed, moreover, with all the desired apparatus: clear facsimiles, transcriptions, translations, commentary, substantial bibliography, and three indexes. The lengthy introduction, in particular, is valuable, providing a mise au point for future study of Genizah magical texts. Altogether, Hebrew and Aranmaic Incantation Texts from the Cairo Genizah is constructed amply and ably-and is presented in a usably compact (though not inexpensive) format. Aside from their intrinsic philological significance, the incantation texts in this volume raise a surprising number of important interpretive questions, the answers for most of which are not yet available. They betray a richness of influence, in spite of the famous conservatism of magicians. Of these influences, their complex awareness of varieties of Jewish expression presents itself overwhelmingly.</page><page sequence="2">412 BOOK REVIEWS These texts demonstrate a level of popular religion which coexists with and draws heavily upon the official traditions of Jewish law and learning. The magical materials and more formal Jewish traditions share common sources and a common system of ritual and law .... Magical materials from the Genizah demonstrate thorough knowledge of the Bible and considerable acquaintance with Jewish folklore and in some cases Rabbinic tradition. These people were by no means disconnected, then, from the study of and practice of Judaism as it is represented in the great mediaeval codes of Jewish law. (pp. 50-51) On the one hand, then, some incantations exhibit knowledge of legal terminology (pp. 108, 109, 135), including those for ketubbot (pp. 108, 134, 155) and get formulae (pp. 108, 109, 156). On the other hand, the magicians seem to have been familiar with Merkavah traditions (pp. 24-26). Still, the identity of the Genizah magicians and their clients remains obscure, despite admirable efforts on the part of the authors. What little can be said responsibly at this point is summarized succinctly (pp. 49-52).1 This frustrating impasse may force research on the amulets as Jewish literature into more comparative studies. Several areas of Jewish literature are relevant in this regard. Of these, the materials for exploratioj include the (considerably varied) materials available from earlier Jewish practices, from contiguous Sephardic communities, from printed texts, and from later amulets. For example, the shir shel pega'im (p. 39) was already used in an apparently magical practice by the Qumran community, and was known to the rabbis.2 Schiffman and Swartz find the possibility that scribes wrote the amulets to be suggestive, but without evidence to confirm it (pp. 49-40). Similarly, a close comparison of these texts with others deriving from Jewish communities of the Middle East can be very helpful. An example is the "seven angels appointed over the seven days of the week" (TS K1.18,30 11. 27-30; p. 74): 1. First names found here are common to the Genizah folk, but the amulets identified parties by the mother's name (p. 45). This would seem to have adhered to a magical procedure standard in the region.

Baumgarten.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 413 Shorshe ha-shemot by Moses ben Mordechai Zacuto (1620-1697) employs the same hebdomad, though in a different order.3 Beyond these necessary comparisons with other Jewish texts, it also would be helpful to compare these incantations more fully with those found in Gnostic and Greco-Roman analogues, which the authors have done to a certain extent. They also have considered Jewish Aramaic texts, and furthermore have noted Mandaic parallels at some points (pp. 18, 28). Finally, numerous examples of other Jewish amulets exist which could be inventoried for comparison.4 Christian Aramaic (Syriac) parallels might usefully be added to the corpus of comparative materials.5 It seems increasingly striking that Jewish magicians apparently inscribed texts not only in Christian Aramaic,6 but in Mandaic Aramaic7 and Arabic as well.8 This growing body of evidence further "adds some weight to the supposition that magic may have been considered to some extent a Jewish specialization."9 Yet other comparisons could helpfully contextualize these texts. Of these, the closest at hand is Muslim magic. Even though these texts were composed in Hebrew and Aramaic, they betray Arabisms (pp. 68, 76, 89, 158). The authors note that at least one of the texts was written by a scribe who also wrote an amulet in Judeo-Arabic (p. 136). Since contemporaneous Muslim magic was replete with Jewish materials, this is perhaps the most pressing and immediate comparison to undertake. Finally, new theoretic approaches are developing for the study of such texts. A promising psychoanalytic study of 3.
