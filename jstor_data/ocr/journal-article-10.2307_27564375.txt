<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Sch?fer. Jesus in the Talmud. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007. xv, 210 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001323 In this slender, attractive, volume, Peter Sch?fer analyzes all the key pas sages from the Babylonian Talmud pertaining to Jesus of Nazareth. Following a brief general introduction (1-14), the sources are covered, sensibly, in biographi cal order: Sch?fer begins with Jesus' family life (15-24), proceeds through his education (25^0), teaching (41-51), healings (52-62), execution (63-74), and, finally, his punishment in hell (82-94). As we have come to expect from this author, careful attention to the manuscript variants?particularly essential for this topic?characterizes the analysis throughout. A thoughtful cumulative essay on Jesus in the Talmud concludes the volume (95-129). 424</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews On the one hand, the author's collection is expansive: He helpfully includes all the Bavli passages that possibly discuss Jesus, irrespective of any judgment concerning their historicity. Sch?fer includes B. Sanh?drin 107b (Jesus as a disci ple of Joshua ben Perahya) and B. Sanh?drin 67a ([Jesus] Ben Stada executed in Lod), even though these are believed by some authorities (e.g., Joseph Klausner and Jacob Z. Lauterbach) to refer to other controversial characters either coinci dentally named Jesus or eventually confused with him rather late in the traditions' development. Erring on the side of inclusion in all these decisions, Sch?fer stands on solid ground, and he serves his readers well. On the other hand, the author has less helpfully chosen to focus primarily on the topic as defined by his title: Jesus in the Talmud. Passages concerning (alleged) Christians or Christian teachings without mentioning Jesus directly (e.g., B. Shabbat 116a-b) are not discussed (cf. 186 n. 107). Passages from nontalmudic literature (Kohelet Rabbah) are addressed only insofar as they relate to the talmudic passages the book focuses on. Finally, Sch?fer has presented the texts in translation, with only occasional transliterations of key Hebrew and Aramaic terms. So buyers beware: The present volume will not replace R. Travers Herford's Christianity in Talmud and Midrash.1 Still, for its careful textual notes, provocative analysis, and helpful bibliography, this new work should surely find a place right next to Herford in the personal libraries of scholars interested in Jesus or the Talmud. Moreover, because the volume is both readable and inexpensive, it can reasonably and productively be assigned in courses on rabbinic literature. To my mind, the most compelling argument of the book pertains to the author's explanation of the distinctive nature of the Babylonian traditions concern ing Jesus. These traditions are?when compared with the Palestinian Talmud and midrashim?much more detailed in their content and sharper in their criticism. Sch?fer suggests the following: [T]he increasingly precarious status of the Christians in the Sassanian Empire, with the waves of persecutions breaking out under Shapur II and continuing under some of his successors, makes it highly likely that a cultural climate could develop in which the Jews felt not only free but even encouraged to express their anti-Christian sentiments?and that they could expected to be supported in this endeavor by the Persian government. (121-22) The argument is sensible and richly annotated; if Sch?fer has not proved his point conclusively, surely he has given scholarship an important hypothesis to consider. Slightly less compelling?but no less provocative?are the creative read ings Sch?fer presents along the way to his conclusions. The curious expression makdiah tavshilo (B. Sanh?drin 103a) receives a thorough analysis (25-33), and Sch?fer agrees with those who interpret the phrase sexually. This then adds further support to the commonly accepted view that rabbinic allusions to Jesus' 1. R. Travers Herford, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash (New York: Ktav, 1975 [1903]; recently reprinted). 425</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews illegitimacy seek to controvert Christian claims regarding his miraculous birth (15-24, 97-102). The author also imaginatively analyzes B. Gittin 56b-57a, which unforgettably depicts Jesus' punishment in hell: boiling in excrement (82-94). Sch?fer suggests that this punishment alludes to Jesus' statement in Mark 7:17-20, to the effect that what goes into the mouth passes through; only what comes out of the mouth truly defiles. The author takes this one step further, suggesting that the passage "is a devastating and quite malicious polemic against the Gospels' message of Jesus' claim that whoever follows him and, literally, eats him becomes a member of the new covenant" (92). That Jesus' punishment here constitutes poetic justice for some Christian consumption is a fascinating hypothesis to consider. But I doubt that the rabbis have the Euchar ist in mind. After all, from a Jewish perspective, the Eucharist is not nearly as scan dalous as the more obviously controversial Christian abrogation of the Jewish food laws. If Sch?fer is right that Mark 7:17-20 motivates the talmudic image, then it is simpler and more reasonable to conclude that the Christian rejection of the food laws (Mark 7:19b) provides the motivation for the image. Regardless, it also must be pointed out that Sch?fer overuses the term "malicious" (22, 92) in describ ing the rabbis' purely textual response to Christian supersessionism. After all, if the Palestinian sources are indeed more restrained in their critique?and if we are to look for social causes for this?whose malice kept the western Amoraim quiet? These readings lead toward the book's second general argument. Sch?fer confidently concludes that the Bavli traditions concerning Jesus constitute a rela tively coherent, textually informed, response to Christianity (122-29). In other words, the rabbis knew the Gospels (especially John; see also 72-73). While there are a few passages that suggest possible familiarity with gospel traditions (e.g., B. Shabbat 116a, which all but quotes Matthew 5:17), other connections drawn by Sch?fer are less convincing (to peruse his list, see 123-24). But the real problem here is that the talmudic passages, taken together, present a picture completely at odds with the Gospel narrative. If all we had was the Bavli, we would think that Jesus was executed by stoning, in Lod, by rabbis (B. Sanh?drin 67a), forty days following his conviction (B. Sanh?drin 43a), either well into the tannaitic period, or during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (B. Sanh?drin 107b), and that his five disciples were executed as well (B. Sanh?drin 43a-b). All this, while the Talmud says nothing to counter claims that Jesus was the Messiah, or that his sacrificial death supersedes the Temple service. It is possible, as noted earlier, that the sexually charged images of Jesus constitute a response to claims concerning his miraculous birth. It is also possible that Jesus' punishment in hell is a response?by reversal?to Christian teaching regarding diet. But this kind of argumentation only goes so far, especially when the texts are so "fragmen tary and scattered" (129). Readers of any one of the Gospels would have known that Jesus was crucified, in Jerusalem, by Romans, shortly after his trial, early in the first century CE, and that his twelve disciples were spared. And this is to say nothing of the Messiah or a sacrificial death. These differences between the Gospels and the Talmud do not exemplify a "daring and powerful counter Gospel" (129). These, rather, exhibit historical and textual ignorance, whether 426</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews willful or not. As Herford put it long ago, "[T]he Talmud has preserved only a very vague and confused recollection of Jesus."2 Finally, a word needs to be said about the production of this book. The prose is quite readable, but the presentation is frustratingly cumbersome. While many primary source references are provided parenthetically, many others are, inexplic ably, buried in endnotes. While many of the variant readings for passages discussed within the body of the work are provided in the endnotes, other variants relating to censored texts are elucidated in an appendix (131-44), which itself then directs readers to its own section of endnotes. Making matters more difficult, no primary source index is provided. So, one further warning to readers: Be prepared to flip back and forth through the back matter of book, even for brief pieces of essential information that surely could have been presented, parenthetically, in the body of the text. This is one last reason why readers will likely read this work only alongside Herford 's classic, which unfortunately remains unsurpassed in too many ways.
