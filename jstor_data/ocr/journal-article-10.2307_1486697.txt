<plain_text><page sequence="1">"TEXTS OF TERROR": RABBINIC TEXTS, SPEECH ACTS, AND THE CONTROL OF MORES by MICHAEL L. SATLOW In 1962, J. L. Austin published a set of lectures entitled How to Do Things with Words.' In this founding document of speech act theory, Austin argues that language not only can say things, but it can also do things (what he calls the illocutionary force of language).2 Austin's signal example of the illocutionary force of language is the wedding ceremony, in which words properly recited actually create a marriage.3 Later students of speech act theory have expanded the application of this insight: all language, written or spoken, has an illocutionary force that depends on the context of the speech act.4 All language not only, or even primarily, says; it also does. References to the Mishnah, Tosefta, Sipre Numbers, Sipre Deuteronomy, Babylonian Talmud and Palestinian Talmud are indicated respectively by m., t., Sipre Num., Sipre Deut., b. and y., followed by an abbreviation for the name of the tractate. A version of this paper was read at the 1993 AAR/SBL Annual Meeting in the "History and Literature of Early Judaism" section. In addition to the participants of that section and the two anonymous referees for this journal, I owe thanks to several people who read this paper in one or another of its various forms and offered many helpful suggestions: Shaye Cohen, Richard Kalmin, Benny Kraut, Holt Parker, Amy Richlin, Benjamin Sommer, Richard Sarason, and Judith Romney Wegner. I, of course, remain responsible for the ideas and remaining errors. 1. J. L. Austin, How to Do Things with Words (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1962). 2. Ibid., pp. 4-11, 94-107. 3.

SATLOW Rarely have scholars applied the questions developed in speech act theory to the rabbinic texts of late antiquity.5 What did rabbinic texts do? Recent scholarship, especially in anthropological and sociological literature on religion and in feminist film criticism, has shown that one thing that texts (however broadly defined) do is to construct and reproduce social relations within a culture.6 Movies, for example, by representing as "normal" or glorifying cultural norms--even (or perhaps better, especially) on a deep level--serve to reinforce current cultural norms and to reproduce them for the future. Even ostensibly objective scientific discourse has been shown to be a cultural product: the modem presentation, for example, of reproductive theories uses language that reflects and perpetuates gender stereotypes.7 If visual media are the primary mode for the transmittal of cultural norms in the present day, texts were an important mode of transmittal among the elite in antiquity. If we assume that the rabbis formed small social groups within a much larger social context, and were distinguished by their textual study and "text-centeredness," then these rabbinic texts may have been the primary means by which the rabbis attempted to reinforce and reproduce sanctioned cultural norms.8 That is, a group that gives much authority to received texts John R. Searle, Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969). Throughout this paper I follow the conclusions of Petrey, who argues that all language, including textual language (for which Austin did not allow), is "performative," that is, has illocutionary force (Sandy Petrey, Speech Acts and Literary Theory [New York: Routledge, 1990], pp. 22-41). 5. One notable exception is Steven D. Fraade, From Tradition to Commentairy: Torah and Its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifre to Deuteronomy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991). Fraade argues that Sifre Deuteronomy had an illocutionary effect on its audience, helping rabbis to establish group identification and solidarity: "In a sense, as they work through the commentary the commentary works throught [sic] them," (p. 19). I argue here that disparate traditions, like a fixed text, can also have a transformative force. 6. See for examples Laura Mulvey, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," Screen 16, no. 3 (1975): 6-18; Teresa de Lauretis, Alice Doesn 't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984); Judith Mayne, "Feminist Film Theory and Criticism," Signs 11 (1986): 81-100. 7. See Emily Martin, "The Egg and the Sperm: How Science has Constructed a Romance Based on Stereotypical Male-Female Roles," Signs 16 (1991): 485-501. 8. Rabbinic social organization is poorly understood. Lee Levine postulates that in Palestine in the mid-late third century the rabbis formed a "class," although his use of the term is somewhat vague (Lee Levine, The Rabbinic Class of Roman Palestine [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary and Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 1989], pp. 13-14). Goodblatt and Gafni have debated whether rabbis in Babylonia were organized in disciple circles or larger learning academies.</page><page sequence="3">TEXTS OF TERROR 275 would most likely attempt, consciously or unconsciously, to embed, and thus perpetuate, its societal strategies within its own literary productions. If we accept the premise that the rabbis in late antiquity had limited juridical power, then the only way by which they could have promoted their values and norms would have been through rhetorical persuasion.9 Rabbinic texts, in this context, can be seen as agents of persuasion."0 One area that the rabbis attempted to regulate and control was sexuality. In even the most coercive society, a complex mix of strategies must operate in order to enforce cultural sexual norms. A society might employ strategies as diverse as honor and shame, invective, and even ideals of truth, in order to promote sanctioned sexual behavior of the individual within that society."I These "technologies of sex," as Foucault terms them, are intended to penetrate into domains that the law cannot. See David Goodblatt, Rabbinic Instruction in Sassanian Babylonia (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1975); and idem, "New Developments in the Study of the Babylonian Yeshivot," Zion 46 (1981): 14-38 (in Hebrew); Isaiah Gafni, "Yeshiva and Metivta," Zion 43 (1978): 12-37 (in Hebrew). Both of these alternatives share the assumption that these groups were organized expressly for the purpose of study and learning of texts. The intended reader of rabbinic texts, especially the Talmudim, is also not well understood. For some preliminary comments, see David Kraemer, "The Intended Reader and the Bavli," Prooftexts 13 (1993): 125-140, esp. 132-133. 9. Rabbinic jurisdiction over the punishment of offenders who did not voluntarily submit to the rabbinic courts is not well understood. It appears, however, that only in exceptional cases did the rabbis administer punishments other than flogging, and even then they were said to have acted illegally. See Origen, Ep. ad Africanus 14 (Patrologia Graeca, 11:41); b. Git. 67b; b. B. Qam. 59a-b. See further Isaiah M. Gafni, The Jews of Babylonia in the Talmudic Era (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center 1990), pp. 99-100 (in Hebrew); Jacob Neusner, A History of the Jews in Babylonia (5 vols.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1965-70), 2:282-287, 3:220-29; Martin Goodman, State and Society in Roman Galilee, A.D. 132-212, (Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1983), p. 123. 10. I make no argument throughout this paper on the thorny issue of whether, and when, these "texts" circulated in oral or written form. While my argument is neater if we assume assume that they circulated in written form at a fairly early stage of their genesis, it is not invalidated if we assume an oral circulation (whether in a ptiblic context via sermons or a narrower context in individual rabbinic schools or academies). Although it strikes me as unlikely that the texts considered here, many of which are highly stylized, circulated orally, it is likely that the attitudes expressed in them were part of public discourse. I thank a referee for raising this issue. 11. For a statement on how these strategies of control, among others, were manipulated and deployed, see Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, vol. 1, An Introduction, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Random House, 1980).</page><page sequence="4">276 MICHAEL L. SATLOW Within the extant rabbinic documents produced in late antiquity too there exist "technologies of sex," or similarly, "technologies of gender," texts that sought to assert some nonlegal measure of control over sexuality while fortifying and reproducing existent gender relations.12 In this paper I analyze one such technology: the construction of women as sexual objects. Rabbinic texts that discuss male sexual behavior employ different rhetorical strategies than those that discuss female sexual behavior. Whereas the rabbinic texts on male sexual conduct speak to and directly threaten men, those on female sexual conduct speak about women, often with a violence of language. After demonstrating the formal differences between rabbinic texts that attempt to control male and female sexual behavior, I argue that the insights of speech act theory, especially as used in modem feminist criticism, can be applied fruitfully to these sources. Talking about Women Rabbinic texts that discuss female sexual behavior are oblique. Women, in these texts, are portrayed as objects. Instead of addressing themselves to women, the texts are about women. Moreover, these texts further objectify women by comparing female sexuality to food, and often these discussions use violent language. Nowhere in these rabbinic texts do violence and unsanctioned female sexual behavior intersect more clearly than they the treatment of the so.ta. According to Numbers 5, a man who suspects his wife of adultery has a right to bring her to the priest, who conducts a ritual and forces her to drink a potion, "the water of bitterness."" The suspected adulteress is called the sota. Rabbinic, especially tannaitic, discussion of the so.ta go far beyond the biblical prescriptions in three respects: (1) they emphasize that the sota ordeal is public; (2) they exaggerate the humiliation of the sota; and (3) they apply 12. See Teresa de Lauretis, Technologies of Gender (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987), pp. 1-30. 13. What this passage means in its biblical context--especially its similarity or dissimilarity to trials by ordeal - is not our concern. In this article I deal only with the rabbinic use of this passage. For some comments on its biblical context, see Tikvah Frymer-Kensky, "The Strange Case of the Suspected Sotah (Numbers V 11-31)," Vetus Testamentum 34 (1984): 11-26.</page><page sequence="5">TEXTS OF TERROR 277 the principle of "measure for measure" to the ordeal.14 These discussions are also marked with gory and vivid detail and violence of language. Since the rabbis, by their own admission, are describing a ritual that has long since become obsolete (if it was ever in fact enacted), these texts become the actual producers of meaning." According to the Bible, the so.ta ordeal involves three actors: the suspicious husband, the suspected wife, and the priest who conducts the ordeal. The ordeal itself takes place before the priest (Num 5:15), where he "bring[s] her forward and [has] her stand before the Lord," (Num 5:16). There are hints that the ordeal begins inside the Tabernacle (Num 5:17) and ends at the altar (Num 5:25). There is no hint of public participation in the biblical account. According to the Mishnah, however, the suspected wife is adjured by the Great Court (instead of by a single priest), before being led outside where "anyone who wants to see comes and sees... and all the women are permitted to see her, as it is said, '... and all the women shall take warning not to imitate your wantonness' [Ezek 23:48]."16 The public nature of the ordeal is essential: for the women, at least, she is made example. Even the suspicion of adultery puts a woman at risk of public display and humiliation.17 This aspect of the rabbinic construction of the ordeal is emphasized in the Babylonian Talmud: "Raba said, 'All who want to see her see' [citing the mishnah], there is no difference between men and women but women are obligated to see 14. Milgrom argues that (2) and (3) may be inherent in the biblical text. See Jacob Milgrom, Numbers, The JPS Torah Commentary (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989), p. 303, nn. 55, 64. 15.

All translations of biblical texts are from Tanakh: A New Translation of the Holy Scriptures according to the Traditional Hebrew Text (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1985). Some translations have been slightly modified. 17. For another example on the link between the suspected adulteress and public humiliation, see Sipre Deut. 26 (ed. L.

The role that honor and shame played in Jewish societies in late antiquity is obscure.</page><page sequence="6">278 MICHAEL L. SATLOW her..."'" Women must see the suspected adulteress to scare them into proper behavior. Rabbinic sources go beyond the public shaming of the adulteress, pre- scribing actual humiliation and physical abuse. According to the Bible, the priest begins the so.ta ordeal by baring the woman's head (Num 5:18). The discourse of the Mishnah is far more violent: The priest grabs her garments-if they rip, they rip; if they tear open, they tear open - until he reveals her heart and loosens her hair.... If she was covered in white garments, he covers her in black garments; if she has gold jewelry and chains, earrings and rings-they strip [them] from her, in order to disgrace her. And afterwards he brings Egyptian rope and binds her above her breasts.'9 The Mishnah's description of the ordeal finds no biblical support. Not only is the woman publicly accused of her transgression, but she is first subjected to physical violence and then disfigured. She is forced to hold her offering "in order to oppress her."20 This language resurfaces later: when the Mishnah describes what happens to the potion (which has a sanctified status) if the so.ta confesses in the middle of the ordeal, it states that although she has confessed, "they cajole her and force her to drink against her will."21 R. Yehudah expands on this in the Tosefta, saying that "they force her mouth open with tongs."22 The Mishnah, attempting to link the illnesses incurred by the guilty sota to her activities, delineates a theory of "measure for measure."23 Everyone receives just and equal recompense for their actions. The Tosefta expands on this theme: A. Thus you find with the sota that the measure with which she measured they measure out to her. She stood before him [i.e., her lover] so that she would be pretty before him, therefore the priest stands her before all, to show her 18. b. Sota 8b, my emphasis. 19. m. Sota 1:5-6 (ed.

She put on a head-covering for him,24 thus the priest takes the covering from her head and places it at her feet. C. She braided her hair for him, thus the priest loosens it. D.

She gave him fine wine to drink in fine cups, thus the priest causes her to drink bitter waters in a vessel of clay.27 Whereas the Mishnah progresses according to the order of the ordeal (each part of the ordeal is shown to have a correspondence in the suspected adulteress's behavior), the Tosefta progresses according to the suspected act of adultery, linking each activity to a part of the ordeal. Thus, although the effects of the potion (D, E) obviously result from her drinking the potion (M), the Tosefta places the former first. The effect of the passage is to highlight the violent punishments that result from every (suspected) activity of the (suspected) adulteress. Every activity leading to the suspected act of adultery is violently punished.28 24. This follows Lieberman's suggestion (Saul Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah: A Com- prehensive Commentary on the Tosefta [10 vols.; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1955-88], 8:637 [in Hebrew]. Hereafter abbreviated Tos. Kip.). The force of this action--a woman putting on a head-covering for her lover-is obscure, but seems to imply that this is a form of dressing up for her lover. 25.

The adulterous wife is punished beyond her measure. "Because she set her eyes upon another who is not fitting for her, what she requested is not given to her and what she has is taken from her."29 What she has, according to the midrash, is her honor.3" A baraita emphasizes this: "Shimon ben Eleazar taught, even if it is a pure woman who drinks [the ordeal], her end is that she will die by evil diseases because she caused herself to enter this great uncertainty."3' It does not matter that the sota was in fact innocent: the punishments and humiliation that she endured as part of the ordeal are justified by the very fact that she put herself under the suspicion that led to the ordeal. Whether or not she is guilty of adultery, she is guilty of at least acting like an adulteress, and this alone justifies her humiliation, even death. Written at a time when the ordeal had long been obsolete, these rabbinic discussions of the so.ta, in tannaitic and amoraic, Palestinian and Babylonian sources, are marked by violent language. The violence of the treatment of the sota is accompanied by an objectification: she becomes an example for all Jewish women. Her display and disfigurement are designed to go beyond individual punishment. The texts themselves, and perhaps the producers of them, seem to take pleasure in the vividness of the accounts. They make the suspected adulteress into a didactic object. If the case of the sota is exceptional because it refers to adultery, a similar (although less violent) pattern can be seen with reference to premarital sex. Premarital sex is, in the Hebrew Bible, prohibited for neither men nor women. The rabbis too do not prohibit pre-marital sex, but they clearly disapproved of females (and to a lesser extent, males too) engaging in it. One of the rhetorical strategies by which they expressed this disapproval was by use of the term zonah. The term appears frequently in the Bible, and commonly means "whore" or "adulteress."32 In rabbinic literature, the term is most often interpreted with reference to the restriction on a priest marrying a zonah (Lev 21:7): whom precisely may a priest not marry? Several rabbinic sources label 29. t. Sota 4:16 (ed. Lieberman, 3.2:175-176). 30. Sipre Num. 21 (ed. Horovitz, 25). 31. y. So.ta 3:5, 19a. See also y. Sota 1:5, 17a; 4:1, 19c. 32.

Hence, although in rabbinic sources both men and women were discouraged from premarital intercourse, only the female partners of these liaisons acquired a derogatory epithet (zonah) and legal disadvantage (disqualified from marrying a priest). The linguistic objectification of women goes beyond that of the application of the term zonah. One of the most prevalent, and clearest, example of this tendency is the "euphemistic," or metaphorical, language by which female sexuality is discussed. Women are "fields" to be "sown"; "bread" or "fish" to be "eaten"; a "cup" to be "used."36 Women are also constructed within these sources as objects of male sexual desire: they are frequently portrayed as sexual temptations to men.37 Unlike men, women are portrayed as having 33. For examples of types of intercourse that render a woman a zonah, see m. Yebam. 8:5 (ed. Albeck, 3:43) (levir and his levirate wife when one of them is sterile); m. Ketub. 5:1 (ed.

SATLOW virtually no sexual self-control.38 Women are thus portrayed as sexual objects whose own sexual desires are relevant only in respect to the effect that they exert on male sexual desire. One rabbinic text exhibits a striking intersection between the violent language and objectification of female sexuality: A.... anything that a man wants to do with his wife, he may do. A parable: [The matter is similar to] meat that comes from the slaughterhouse. If he wants to eat it salted, he eats it [that way]; [if he wants to eat it] roasted, he eats it [roasted]; [if he wants to eat it] boiled, he eats it [boiled]; [if he wants to eat it] seethed, he eats it [seethed]. Thus [too] a fish that comes from the nets ... B. A certain woman came before Rabbi [Yehudah ha-Nasi]. She said to him, "Rabbi, I set my table for him39 and he overturned it!" He said to her, "My daughter, the Torah has permitted you [to him in this way], what can I do for you?" C. A certain woman came before Rav. She said to him, "Rabbi, I set my table for him and he overturned it!" He said, "Is this different from a fish? [i.e., just as a man can eat a fish in any way he desires, so too can he "overturn the table" if he desires]."40 The comparison of female sexuality to food (to be consumed by men) is common both in rabbinic and classical literature, where it serves to objectify female sexuality.41 (B) and (C) relate stories of women going to rabbis to 14:4, 14d (par. y. 'Abod. Zar 2:2, 40d); b. Sanh. 75a. Occasionally women are portrayed as more actively seducing men. See y. Sota 3:4, 19a; b. Ketub. 65a; b. Sabb. 62b (par. b. Yoma 9b). 38. m. Sota 3:4 (ed.

From this passage, it is not clear what position is being referred to. The dictionaries and commentators take it to mean anal intercourse. See Jacob Levy, Wrrterbuch iber die Talmudim und Midraschim (reprinted 4 vols.; Berlin and Wien: B. Harz, 1924), 1:485, s.v., Ipin; and Kohut's remarks in A.

Amy Richlin (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 250-268. My interpretation runs counter to two recent comments on this passage. According to Biale, R. Judah, "by symbolically throwing up his</page><page sequence="11">TEXTS OF TERROR 283 complain about the position in which their husbands want to have sex. Here it is the women who are portrayed objectifying themselves through their own comparisons to "set tables." The results of these encounters are chilling: the women are simply turned away, without recourse, left as objects of their husbands' sexual whims. Rabbi Yehudah's answer in (B) is not a real answer, for the justification for this position is found in a baraita (A), not the Torah. Rav's answer in (C) might even have been read as humorous. Although Rav's comparison of the woman with a fish might have been a dry, legalistic comparison between the woman and the case of (A), it is difficult to imagine that this passage would have been read so dryly: the text seems to "wink" at its male audience. The text leaves women without protection. A similar type of rabbinic tradition can be found in the Babylonian Talmud: Our rabbis taught: Once it happened that a woman came before Rabbi Akiba. She said to him, "Rabbi, I had intercourse during my third year, [can I marry] a priest?" He said to her, "You are permitted [to marry] a priest." She said to him, "Let me make an analogy.

He said to her, "If so, you are not permitted [to marry] a priest." He saw his students looking at each other and he said to them, "Why are you troubled [with this decision]?" They said to him, "Just as the whole Torah is halakah [given] to Moses from Mount Sinai, so too [is the law that] a woman under three years old is permitted [to marry] a priest a law [given] to Moses from Mount Sinai."

This reading strikes me as forced. Boyarin examines this text in more detail, arguing that the context in which it occurs serves exactly to counter the idea of female sexual objectification. See Daniel Boyarin, Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), pp. 109-122. Boyarin goes so far as to label this text "a very embryonic ars erotica," (p. 132), following Foucault's mistaken understanding of classical sources.

SATLOW This tradition ends a long discussion on whether a priest, who is prohibited from marrying a woman who has engaged in be 'ilat zenut, can marry a woman who has had intercourse before she was three years old. In the mishnah upon which this tradition comments, intercourse with a girl under three is compared to "putting a finger in the eye"; this is interpreted in the Babylonian Talmud to mean that her hymen regenerates.43 The narrow legal problem is whether a girl who has had intercourse during her third year is treated like one who is over three years (forbidden to marry a priest) or under three years (permitted to marry a priest) who has had intercourse. At first, R. Akiba gives the proper legal response, that she is permitted to marry a priest. When she confesses, however, that after a few unenjoyable times she did enjoy intercourse at this age, he retracts his permission. Although technically permitted to marry a priest, the woman is prohibited because she is said to have enjoyed her rape. The redactor of the sugya adds a twist to this story: R. Akiba, recognizing that he was acting beyond the limits of the law, did so only to test his students. The entire incident is presented as a pedagogic exercise. As in the passage presented above, a woman is portrayed as going to a rabbi with a question dealing with illicit sex (making her the agent of her own objectification), only to be rebuffed and either mocked or used didactically. Here, the statement that "rape can be enjoyable" is placed in the mouth of the woman.44 Although these two passages are attributed to Palestinian rabbis, there is reason to doubt that they really are of Palestinian provenance. Neither the stories in b. Nedarim nor the one in b. Nidd. are paralleled in Palestinian documents. The parallel in the Palestinian Talmud to the latter story, in fact, has an almost opposite thrust.45 There, the discussion is about rape, and although the woman ends up admitting that she enjoyed the rape, Rabbi Yohanan (before whom the case was presented) permits her to return to her husband. Only in the Babylonian Talmud is her enjoyment stigmatized to the point where she is legally penalized for it. Moreover, the legal category that both stories attempt to illustrate-the status a woman who is raped but enjoys it-is developed at length only in the Babylonian Talmud.46 In these 43. m.

Like the sota texts, these texts too exhibit objectification of female sexuality, marked by discussions about, rather than addressed to, women; and an implied violence.47 All of these texts portray women as powerless sexual objects. One reason for this portrayal, I argue below, is to control female sexuality. A comparison of these texts to those which attempt to control male sexuality further highlights the gender-differentiated strategies employed by the rabbis in controlling sexual mores. Talking to Men The most common way by which the rabbis attempt to dictate male sexual mores is through legislation.48 Several rabbinic traditions, however, take a different tack. These passages attempt to frighten men into sanctioned sexual behavior, without explicitly legislating against the condemned behavior. That is, they do not present themselves as normative texts. One example of this strategy is found in the mishnaic treatment of the sota. A. According to the measure that person measures, so they measure him. She adorned herself for the sake of transgression---God disgraces her. She revealed herself for transgression-God lays her bare. She began her transgression first with [her] "thigh," and then with [her] "belly"----therefore [her] "thigh" is afflicted first, then [her] "belly," and the remainder of her body is not spared [from affliction]. B. Samson went after [what] his eyes [beheld], therefore the Philistines gouged out his eyes, as it is written, "The Philistines seized him and gouged 47. To the sources already discussed may be added several other texts of generally more legal flavor. Women are legally penalized, for example, for immodest behavior in m. Ketub. 7:6 (ed. Albeck, 3:112); they are, according to some authorities, forced to tend to those needs of their husbands that have sexual overtones even when they themselves are in mourning (b. Mo 'ed Qat. 19b); and they are threatened with death in childbirth if they do not inform their husbands that they are menstruating (m. Sabb. 2:6 [ed. Albeck, 2:23], especially as interpreted in b. Sabb. 31 lb-32a). My thanks to Shaye Cohen, who directed me to some of these sources. 48. Most scholars who have written on rabbinic constructions of sexuality have confined themselves primarily to examinations of rabbinic legislation.

Absalom was proud of his hair, therefore he was hung by his hair; and because he had intercourse with the ten concubines of his father, ten javelins were put in him, as it is written, ". .. when ten of Joab's young arms-bearers [closed in and struck Absalom until he died]" [2 Sam 15:6] ..49 According to (A), the entire ritual is constructed around her transgression: her guilt is assumed. If she really did commit adultery, the biblical account says, then "her belly shall distend and her thigh shall sag" (Num 5:27). Why are only thigh and belly mentioned? According to the mishnah, it is because the woman's transgression was committed through her "thigh" (understood as vagina) and "belly" (understood as womb or uterus). This, as discussed above, is an example of the principle of measure for measure. Passage (B) then suddenly shifts.50 Instead of continuing to discuss the sota, the mishnah suddenly applies this same principle to two biblical men who exemplify profligacy, Samson and Absalom. Because Samson was attracted to (see Judg 14:3) and pursued foreign women, he lost his eyes. As Absalom "pierced" his father David's ten concubines, so too was he pierced ten times.5' This same theme is repeated later in the tractate. When adulterers increased, the "water of bitterness" [ritual] ceased, and Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai stopped them, as it is written, 'I will not punish their daughters for fornication, nor their daughters-in-law for committing adultery; for they [themselves turn aside with whores and sacrifice with prostitutes...],' [Hos 4:14].52 49. m. Sota 1:7-8 (ed. Albeck, 3:235-236). 50. This shift is partly to be accounted for by the associative grouping of m. Sota 1:7-9 (ed. Albeck, 3:235-236). All of these passages are linked by their discussion of "measure for measure." Such associative groupings are common in the Mishnah. See H. L. Strack and G. Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1992), pp. 137-138. Nevertheless, this particular grouping appears not to be coincidental, but to have been intentionally constructed in order to convey its point. It is interesting to note, although beyond the scope of this paper, that the next pericope, 1:9, shifts suddenly again. This passage not only applies the "measure for measure" principle to reward rather than punishment, but begins with Miriam. The purpose of beginning with Miriam might be to contrast the "bad" woman with the "good" woman. 51. According to 2 Sam 16:22, Absalom had intercourse with his father's concubines. The number of concubines is inferred from 2 Sam 15:16. 52. m. Sota 9:9 (ed. Albeck, 3:258-259). See the interpretation of this passage offered in t. Sota 14:2 (ed. Lieberman, 3.2:235-236).</page><page sequence="15">TEXTS OF TERROR 287 The message of these mishnaic passages is clear: men who are involved in any promiscuity, but especially adultery, risk both death and their wives' betrayal. Male promiscuity, which the rabbis never explicitly prohibit (al- though adultery--defined for men as intercourse with another man's wife-is prohibited) is strongly discouraged. Samson and Absalom are presented as threatening paradigms, intended to scare men into sanctioned, more chaste behavior. Whereas these mishnaic passages-among the very few tannaitic sources that deploy this strategy of scaring men into sanctioned sexual behavior rather than legislating it-are short and somewhat cryptic, the Babylonian Talmud's deployment of this strategy is much more striking. One text, which polemicizes against intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman, begins by citing a tannaitic tradition about the activity of Pinhas. According to the Bible, immediately after the prophecies of Balaam the Israelites began "whoring with the Moabite women" (Num 25:1) and turning to other gods. God orders Moses to kill the instigators of this idolatry. Just then one of the Israelites came and brought a Midianite woman over to his companions, in the sight of Moses and of the whole Israelite community, who were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. When Pinhas, son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saw this, he left the assembly and, taking a spear in his hand, he followed the Israelite into the chamber and stabbed both of them, the Israelite and the woman, through the belly. Then the plague against the Israelites was checked." The tannaitic tradition based on this biblical account is concerned with the question of authority: does Pinhas act alone, or does he consult with his elders or in some way know that he has God's approval?54 The sole concern of this tradition, and of the sugya that cites it in the Palestinian Talmud, is that of zeal and its control.55 Pinhas must be "domesticated," so that other would-be zealots do not think that they are sanctioned to act without rabbinic permission. Preceding the citation of this tradition in the Babylonian Talmud, however, is the following discussion: 53. Num 25:6-8. 54. Sipre Num. 131 (ed. Horovitz, 172). 55. y. Sanh. 10:2, 27d. See also, y.

Rav completely forgot, and Rav Kahana read in a dream, "Judah has broken faith; abhorrent things have been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned what is holy to the Lord--what He desires-and espoused daughters of alien gods" [Mal 2: 11]. C. He [Rav Kahana] came, and said to him, "This is what I read. Rav completely remembered [the answer to (A)]." D. [Rav interprets each clause of Mal 2:11, ending with:] "and espoused daughters of alien gods"--this is one who has intercourse with a Gentile woman (kutit), and it is written after it, "May the Lord leave to him who does this no descendants ('er ve 'onah) dwelling in the tents of Jacob and presenting offerings to the Lord of Hosts," [Mal 2:12] - if he is a scholar, he shall have no light ('er) [= teaching] among the sages, nor answer ('onah) in disciples. If he is a priest, he will not have a son to offer the meal offering to the Lord of Hosts. E. R. Hiyya bar Abuyah said, "Any man who has intercourse with a Gentile woman (kutit), it is as if he wed (Tnnro) an idol, as it is written, "and espoused daughters of alien gods." What daughter does an idol have? Rather, this [refers] to one who has intercourse with a Gentile woman" [An unrelated story involving R. Hiyya bar Abuyah follows]. F. When Rav Dimi came he said, "The Court of the Hasmoneans decreed that one who has intercourse with a Gentile56 woman transgresses the law prohibiting [the mnemonic for intercourse with a menstruant, slave-woman, Gentile woman, and married woman]." When Ravin came he said, "[He transgresses the law prohibiting] nsgz [the mnemonic for intercourse with] a menstruant, slave-woman, Gentile woman, and z6nah, but not because of marriage [i.e., adultery, designated by the a in NSGA], because they [= Gentiles] do not have it [= the institution of marriage]." And the other [R. Dimi, how would he reply]? Certainly they [= Gentiles] do not leave their wives open [to all]. G. R. Hisda said, "If one comes for counsel [whether to kill a man engaged in intercourse with a Gentile woman], we do not advise him [to do so]." H. It was also stated, Rabah bar bar Hanah said in the name of R.

"So Moses said to Israel's officials, 'Each of you slay those of his men who attached themselves to Baal-peor' " [Num 25:5]. The tribe of Shimon went to Zimri ben Salu. They said to him, "They are sitting in a capital court, and you sit in silence?" What did he do? He stood and gathered 24,000 men from Israel and went to Kozbi. He said to her, "Submit to me" [i.e., have sex with me]. She said to him, "I am the daughter of a king, and my father commanded me to submit only to the greatest among them." He said to her, Even he is [= I am] the prince of a tribe and not only that but he is greater than him [Moses], for he [Zimri's tribe] is second-born, and he [Moses's tribe] is third-born." He grabbed her by her braid and brought her to Moses. He [Zimri] said to him [Moses], "Son of Amram, is she forbidden or permitted? And if you say that she is forbidden, who permitted the daughter of Yitro to you?" [Moses] forgot the law [concerning the right of zealots to harm one engaged in intercourse with a Gentile woman]. All the people burst out crying, as it is written, "[Just then one of the Israelites came and brought a Midianite woman over to his companions, in the sight of Moses and the whole Israelite community,] who were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting" [Num 25:6]. K. "When Pinhas, son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saw this .. ." [Num 25:7]. Saw what? L. Rav said, "He saw the act and remembered the law. He [Pinhas] said to him [= Moses], 'Brother of my father's father, did you not teach me when you descended from Mount Sinai, that if one has intercourse with a Gentile woman that zealots are permitted to attack him?' He said to him, 'Let him who dictates the letter be its carrier.' " M. Shmuel said, "He saw that 'No wisdom, no prudence, and no counsel can prevail against the Lord' [Prov 21:30]. Every place God's name is being desecrated, one does not accord honor to his teacher."57 The Babylonian Talmud firmly recontextualizes the story of Pinhas, which follows the cited passage. The tannaitic tradition of Pinhas is now used to illustrate the potential harm that can come to those Jewish men who dare to have intercourse with Gentile women. The Babylonian Talmud too is uneasy with Pinhas's unrestrained zeal: sections (G) and (H) say that if a zealot comes to ask a rabbi whether or not he is permitted to slay such a person, he is to be told that he is not. Yet these sections, as well as the rest of the sugya, also display an ambivalence. Men are not prohibited from being zealots; if 57. b. Sanh. 81b-82b. See also b. 'Abod. Zar. 36b.</page><page sequence="18">290 MICHAEL L. SATLOW they do not ask, they will not necessarily be told to refrain from such an act. To be sure, zealots are warned of the danger (I) of taking the law into their hands, but ultimately the choice is left to them. Correspondingly, this heightens the danger to men who choose to participate in such liaisons. Even if the Jewish lover escapes punishment at the hands of the zealots, he still faces a variety of divine punishments inflicted by God (D). Section (F) defines intercourse with a Gentile woman as a violation of a negative precept.58 Note also that here, and only here, is Moses himself indicted for intermarriage, and punished by forgetting his own teaching and losing honor from Pinhas (J). A similar composition is b. Nid. 13a-b, an extended polemic against male masturbation which I examine in detail elsewhere.59 The redactor(s) of this sugya draw upon tannaitic and amoraic sources, of both Babylonian and Palestinian provenance, often reshaping their original meanings through a variety of editing techniques. The result is a long, coherent composition that, going well beyond simple exposition of the mishnah (m. Nid. 2:1), proffers a variety of threats intended to keep men from masturbating: masturbation is accounted as serious a transgression as murder, idolatry, or adultery; it can cause communal punishment; it can cause personal damnation; it warrants death. Holy men, according to this sugya, refrain from touching, even looking upon, their genitals, lest they be led to masturbate. There can be little doubt that the redactor(s) carefully composed this passage in order to frighten its male readers into sanctioned sexual behavior. The redactor(s) of the Babylonian Talmud resort(s) to a panoply of vague threats to enforce sanctioned sexual behavior for men. Both of these texts are relatively uncomplicated: they appear intended to be read by men, in order 58. To my knowledge, this is the only place in the literature that such a claim is made, although the stories in the Babylonian Talmud of rabbis flogging men who have had intercourse with Gentile women seem to assume it. See b. Ber. 58a (attributed to R. Shila). The printed edition reads that he was caught with an Egyptian woman, but manuscripts replace this with the more general "Gentile woman." See J. Rabbinovicz, Dikduke Soferim (reprinted 14 vols.; Brooklyn and Jerusalem: Me'ain Hahohmah, 1959/60), 1:326; b. Ta 'an. 24b (attributed to Court of Raba); y. Ta 'an. 3:4, 66c (a rabbi castigates the Jews of Sepphoris for their "acts of Zimri." The act of Zimri as recorded in the Bible and discussed in talmudic literature was intercourse with a Gentile woman. But the talmudic use of this phrase is not necessarily consistent. See, for example, b. Sota. 22b, which appears to use "acts of Zimri" to refer to general transgressions. The reference in this tradition to the plague, however, echoes that of the biblical story of Zimri). 59. See Michael L.

In contrast to the texts on female sexuality, they directly threaten men with punishment, rather than objectifying them and portraying them as sexually powerless.60 Speech Acts and Rabbinic "Pornography " According to Austin, the illocutionary force of a speech act is grounded in context and convention.61 Exactly the same words said in different contexts often have very different "meanings." The success (its "felicity," in Austin's words) of an illocutionary speech act thus depends upon its context. To modify Austin's example of marriage, this concern can be seen clearly in much of tractate Qiddushin. It is not enough for a man to give a woman a certain amount of money to betroth her, or to recite a fixed text to marry her; he must perform this acts under very specific conditions for the intended force (betrothal or marriage) to be felicitous. Moreover, all parties in a speech act must share the same conventions in order for the illocutionary act to be felicitous: the statement "I bet you that.. .," loses its illocutionary force when said to someone who does not understand the cultural meaning of betting. The application of speech act theory to the rabbinic texts surveyed above forces us to question the illocutionary force of those texts that discuss female sexuality. What were these texts intended to do? What conventions governed the reception of these texts? Were the texts, as illocutions, felicitous? Modem critical discussions of pornography can serve as a useful theoreti- cal framework for approaching these questions. Abandoning the identification of pornography with the prurient, scholars have recently emphasized the degrading characteristics of pornography. Susanne Kappeler has argued that the distinguishing feature of pornography is representation: whenever a "text" (or movie or picture) objectifies a woman for consumption by a male audience, that text can be called pornographic.62 Although Kappeler's 60. Not surprisingly, the only passages in rabbinic literature where, to my knowledge, men are sexually objectified discuss pathic male homoeroticism, i.e., situations where men are thought to be behaving like women.

SATLOW position might be extreme, definitions of pornography now emphasize the dehumanization and objectification of women.63 That is, there is a move toward defining pornography not according to its formal characteristics, but instead its illocutionary force. The connection between pornography and speech act theory is made explicitly by Rae Langton: "Pornography's effects may be best explained by supposing that it has the illocutionary force of subordination."64 Defined in this way, pornography becomes a useful model for considering the rabbinic material. Austin insists that understanding context and convention is necessary for understanding illocutionary force. While answers to these questions must be speculative (as for all rabbinic material from late antiquity), we can probably safely assume that these texts were produced by men for a male audience, be that audience in synagogue or the academy (with the latter more likely). And while the shared conventions are even more obscure, classical (especially Latin) sources provide intriguing parallels. Several classical sources may help to provide a framework in which to view these rabbinic texts. Rapes described by Livy and Ovid have the same effect as the sota texts: they portray a violence of language and the objec- tification of women, who are seen as sexually powerless.65 Martial "wittily" denigrates female sexual behavior.66 Athenaeus almost makes women and food interchangeable.67 Apuleius (in The Golden Ass) and Lucian (in Dialogues of Courtesans) regularly express violence toward women. Cicero and later Roman legal texts silence women by presenting them according to negative stereotypes (e.g., adulteress, whore).68 Richlin says that the recurrence of the following themes are defining factors of pornography in antiquity: "(1) inequity between partners; (2) objectification of women, with some emphasis 63. This position is most often identified with Catherine MacKinnon. See Catherine MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987).

Many of these texts were written as "wisdom" literature directed toward men, with the result that men are bluntly advised to be .cautious of the sexual behavior of their wives and daughters.70 Halpern-Amaru, however, has pointed out that Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities presents women as stock characters, objectified in order to convey certain models of behavior.71 In the books of Tobit and Joseph and Aseneth also--not to mention the Greek Additions to Esther--too the women are portrayed woodenly, as didactic objects.72 Despite wide differences in chronology, genre, and context, these parallels to the rabbinic material suggest that there were shared conventions for understanding such literature. In late antiquity in at least Roman and Jewish circles, men produced "pornographic" texts for other men who knew how to read them. Now we can ask, how then did they read them? What exactly were these texts doing? Scholars have long noted that language and politics are inseparable. Hence, because the authors of the privileged texts are frequently in positions of power, the social relations that these texts promote are often those of dominance and subordination.73 Texts are not innocuous. Several scholars have argued that 69. Pornography and Representation, p. xviii. 70. See for examples Sir 23:22-26, 26:10-12, 41:22, 42:9-10. Camp sees 26:10-12 as "pornographic" (Claudia V.

Paul, especially in 1 Cor 7, also appears to objectify women. This is not to suggest that all Jewish literature from this time had these characteristics. Far from it: this literature, more than most contemporaneous bodies of literature, gives remarkable expression to female characters. See, for examples, Judith and Testament of Job.

SATLOW male writers have "killed" the female voice: "Metaphysically, the woman reader of a literary tradition that inscribes violence against women is an abused daughter. Like physical abuse, literary violence against women works to privilege the cultural father's voice and story over those of women, the cultural daughters, and indeed to silence women's voices."74 I suggest that these rabbinic texts on female sexuality were intended to promote an atmosphere of intimidation whose function it was to enforce female sexual mores. That is, the violence and objectification of women in these texts would serve to influence their male readers' views of women. Much like modem day "locker-room talk" or subtle forms of sexual harassment (e.g., off-color humor), these texts would have been one factor in the promotion of a societal outlook that would have indirectly discouraged women from unsanctioned sexual behavior. The rabbis directly discourage men from engaging in unsanctioned sexual behavior; they attempt to discourage women (who are not among their immediate audience) by promoting certain (probably preexistent) attitudes and gender hierarchies. For example, by the time of the compilation of the rabbinic documents, the sota ordeal therein described had long ceased.75 The coherence of the picture that these texts paint--the violence and humiliation to which a suspected adulteress is subjected-suggest that the texts are "doing" more than merely preserving the historical record. These texts may have been "intended" to create an atmosphere in which female adultery was discouraged through threat of public humiliation. That is, true violence or an actual ordeal or humiliating ceremony was not necessary: none of these texts encourage actual physical violence, whether physical abuse of the adulteress or marital Gender," in Gender at the Crossroads ofKnowledge: Feminist Anthropology in the Postmodern Era, ed.

Rather, these texts convey underlying values and a violence of language that both husbands and fathers would have taken to heart, influencing their behavior toward wives and daughters. Female sexual behavior was thus controlled by influencing the behavior of those men under whose legal guardianship they fell." Similarly, the passage from b. Nedarim would help to preserve a gender hierarchy in which men were encouraged to view women as sex-objects. Men who read these texts were left to feel more secure with their current, asymmetrical social relationships. Rabbinic "pornography," like its modem cousin, thus played a subtle but important role in the control of female sexuality. The illocutionary force of this literature was to reproduce and reinforce a certain set of gender relationships by encouraging men to view women in certain ways (objects, zonot, etc.). The result was a "silencing" of women's voices. As soon as a woman is seen, for example, as an object, her own sexual desires and wishes are erased. These texts need not have even been transmitted to women in order to scare them; they "worked" as soon as they were said, read, and assimilated by their audience.78 Conclusions How did the rabbis, a juridically weak (if not powerless) group with an apparently limited following, attempt to coerce and persuade men and women 76. The relationship between pornography and actual violence against women is, of course, a still unanswered question. Other rabbinic dicta, however, are clear in prohibiting marital rape. See Boyarin, Carnal Israel, pp. 113-131; Nahum Rackover, "Coercive Marital Relations Between a Man and His Wife," Shenaton Ha-Mishpat Ha-Ivri: Annual of the Institute for Research in Jewish Law 6-7 (1979-80): 295-317 (in Hebrew). We might also presume that women had recourse against abusive husbands in their own families, as appears to have been the case in ancient Rome. See Sarah B. Pomeroy, "The Relationship of the Married Woman to Her Blood Relatives in Rome," Ancient Society 7 (1976): 215-27. The relationship between Jewish women and their families in late antiquity, however, requires further investigation. 77. Hence also the trouble that the rabbis, like other men in antiquity, had in legislating and regulating women who had no male guardians, such as widows. See Judith Romney Wegner, Chattel or Person? The Status of Women in the Mishnah (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), esp. pp. 114-144. 78.

For men, they took the direct route: legislation and explicit threats. These texts may have been welcomed by segments of the male community, for they helped men to fight the "evil desire."79 For women, however, who were not explicitly enjoined to fight the "evil desire," the rabbis relied upon the rhetorical manipulation of social attitudes. By writing "pornography," the rabbis were attempting (on some, not necessarily conscious, level), to reinforce and perpetuate that system of gender relationships with which they were comfortable. To this point I have mainly avoided the messy business of redaction criticism. Rabbinic "culture" was not monolithic. We should not assume that Palestinian rabbis of the third century shared the assumptions and rhetorical strategies of Babylonian rabbis of the the sixth century. The vast majority of the sources cited here are attributed to Palestinians, although the major, stylized texts are confined to the Babylonian Talmud. It may be that both Palestinian and Babylonian rabbis objectified women (as with many other cultures, ancient and modem), but they did so for different purposes. Palestinian rabbis were more concerned with the possibility and ramifications of adultery and marital sexuality than were Babylonians, who had other concerns about sexuality.s0 The rabbinic social use of "pornographic" writings was without doubt more complicated, with more variations, than I have indicated in this paper. Redaction criticism alone however, without in-depth analysis of other evidence for gender relationships in both Palestinian and Babylonian rabbinic culture, will not go far. I have also avoided asking whether the texts were felicitous. Did these texts actually succeed in doing the things that I claim they were intended to do? How did readers respond to them (or, in Austin's language, what was the "perlocution")? These questions touch two much broader issues: who exactly listened to the rabbis in late antiquity? and, what do we know about the actual lives of women? It is important to remember that these texts, by virtue of their presence in the canon, make claims of authority; who did (and would later) take those claims seriously is a significant question. Although we cannot at present answer these questions, my suspicion is that if these 79. For some other methods recommended by the rabbis in the fight against the "evil desire" ('vrn io), see Ephraim E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs, trans. Israel Abrahams (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 475-483; Boyarin, Carnal Israel, pp. 134-166. 80. This would coincide with the general Palestinian rabbinic emphasis on the reproductive function of sex, in contrast to the Babylonians. Cf.

Rabbinic literature itself hints at disapproved, but real, female sexual freedom, as well as female social cliques in which, presumably, females could act as free subjects. In her book Texts of Terror, Phyllis Trible analyzes several biblical scenes of terror against women.8" She never, however, defines exactly what she means by "terror," and does not take the next step: that descriptions of terror do things, usually themselves terrorize. Austin's insight is that that next step, asking about the illocutionary force of a text, is a necessary one. The related issues of authorial intention and social purpose and function, when applied to rabbinic texts, are extremely difficult, since nearly all of our data must derive from the texts themselves. Rabbinic texts do not exist in a vacuum. These texts "did" things; as "technologies of sex and gender," they had social roles and functions. Reinforcement and reproduction of gender relationships was one, but merely one, of the social functions played by these rabbinic texts. University of Virginia Charlottesville, Va. 81.
