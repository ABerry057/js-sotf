Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1985. xvi, 295 pp. Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888) is commonly regarded as the father of modern Jewish Orthodoxy. He is often credited with having spear-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 89 headed not only the resurgence of religious traditionalism in Frankfurt am Main but also the movement of the traditionalists to secede from the formal Jewish community in 1877. In this important study of the conflict between Reform and Orthodoxy in the city of Goethe (as well as of Abraham Geiger and Hirsch), Robert Liberles challenges these basic assumptions. He does so through a careful reconstruction of the struggle within Frankfurt Jewry dur- ing the middle decades of the nineteenth century, which linked issues of religious expression and political power. His analysis-the goal of which ostensibly is to provide social perspective to what has traditionally been seen as a religious debate-in fact combines elements of intellectual, social, and political history. The book is dotted with important insights on such themes as the relationship between religious party and social class, the role of Reform in the promotion of secessionism, and the communal implications of political emancipation. If it falls short of providing that "social history" which the author feels has been lacking in the past, it can certainly be for- given. Early on in his study Liberles lays to rest the notion that it was Hirsch's appearance in Frankfurt in 1851 that laid the groundwork for the re- surgence of Orthodoxy in that city. He demonstrates convincingly that, while the party of Reform ascended in power and influence in the 1830s and 1840s, the self-conscious traditionalists were scarcely dead. Nor were they really in retreat. In fact, the strength of the Orthodox party in Frankfurt owed much to social and economic factors. Liberles astutely points out that the Orthodox Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft (IRG) comprised the wealthier and more aristocratic element within the community, contrary to what one might have expected. Later this foundation of high economic and social standing would combine with the intellectual and organizational skills of Samson Raphael Hirsch to place the IRG as the model community of German Neo-Orthodoxy. Liberles does not ask, however, whether the banking and "aristocratic" background of the IRG members was unique in Germany or common to the phenomenon of Neo-Orthodoxy. Nor does he investigate the possibility that, while wealthier and socially more prestigious than the Reformers, the members of the IRG were in fact less well integrated socially. Closer to home lies the question why. Why did the financial elite in Frankfurt choose to identify with religious traditionalism rather than with Reform? Are reli- gious preferences tied in a meaningful way to occupational structure, with middle-class professionals and businessmen inclined toward Reform and</page><page sequence="3">90 BOOK REVIEWS those in "traditional" occupations tending also toward traditionalism in religious expression? These issues are not raised, yet, it seems to me, they lie at the heart of the "social context" that Liberles seeks to uncover. Liberles's chapter on the personality and early career of Hirsch is par- ticularly suggestive, though brief. The argument that Hirsch saw himself to be the prophet Elijah (alternatively Phinehas, Aaron's grandson), and that the title of his major theoretical work, Horeb, referred not to the Sinai of God's revelation to Moses but to the site of Elijah's battle with Baal, is important to any satisfactory understanding of Hirsch's actions with regard to the Reform movement. Unfortunately barely ten pages are devoted to this theme. Nor does Liberles return to the argument when discussing Hirsch's tactics during the controversy over secession. The bulk of Liberles's study deals with the background to-and politics of-the Orthodox secession from the formal Jewish community in Frank- furt. In the course of setting the record straight, he demonstrates that it was the Reform camp, in fact, which first advocated "separatism" as a political strategy. Geiger himself wavered on the issue during the 1830s and 1840s before eventually rejecting the concept of separation from the official Jewish community. Within the Orthodox establishment, calls for separation increased as the relative strengths of the two movements reversed and the traditionalists were relegated to a minority position. The Orthodox of Frankfurt requested severance from the official community repeatedly dur- ing the 1850s and 1860s. Liberles suggests that the logic of the emancipation process itself raised both the practicality and the attractiveness of secession, if not in fact the dissolution of the Jewish community. In a political context in which reli- gious affiliations were deemed to be voluntary and in which-theoretically, at least-Jews could claim equal services from the state, what interest could there be in making membership in the Jewish community obligatory? On this point Liberles seems to offer a number of answers. The principal interest of the Frankfurt Senate in insisting on compulsory membership in the Jewish community was economic: it did not wish to bear the cost of provid- ing social services to this newly enfranchised group. The Prussian state, on the other hand, hesitated to grant to its Jewish subjects a right which was denied to Christians, namely, to escape the burden of religious taxation, not by leaving the religion in question, but simply by changing parishes. Whatever its understanding of the issue, the Prussian government paved the way for the secession of Hirsch and his followers, first by annexing the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 91 city of Frankfurt in 1866 and then by enacting enabling legislation ten years later. Liberles concludes that, for their part, the Orthodox of Frankfurt, unable to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Reform-dominated board, "had no alternative but to follow the path of autonomy, for which they indeed did possess the financial means" (p. 176). Liberles's careful reconstruction of the social and political context sur- rounding the secession controversy has the effect of reducing the significance of the IRG's defection in 1877. Similarly Hirsch's own personality and ideological agenda loom less large as contributing factors. Yet we learn from Liberles that neither the Orthodox leadership nor the lay population were agreed on the issue; that Rabbi Moses Mainz went so far as to challenge the halakhic competence of Hirsch precisely over the question of secession; that no less an authority than Seligmann Baer Bamberger, perhaps the leading Orthodox rabbi in Germany at the time, threw his weight behind those who opposed Hirsch's decision; and that more than half of the IRG members in 1877 retained full membership in the official Frankfurt community. Sudden- ly the force of Hirsch's own, idiosyncratic personality once again occupies center stage, or so-it seems to me-it ought. Hirsch's brand of Orthodoxy appears to have embodied an historical irony. While it rejected the "separatism" of the "old Orthodox," insisting instead on the involvement of Jews in the modern state and in Western society and culture, it also abandoned the traditional conception of com- munity, in which ties to other Jews were felt to be inalienable no matter how questionable their behavior. The Neo-Orthodoxy of Hirsch transferred the policy of separatism from the external realm to the Jewish world, erecting barriers between "loyalists" and nonloyalists while pursuing a course of integration with the larger environment. This point is never fully developed by Liberles. Religious Conflict in Social Context nevertheless remains an important study of the religious dimensions of emancipation. Hillel J.
