New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2005. 383 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000359 The academic study of Kabbalah is flourishing today, and Moshe Idel is a major contributor to it. Since the publication of his Kabbalah: New Perspectives (Yale University Press, 1988), Idel has introduced new analytical categories, rewritten the history of Kabbalah to replace Scholem's version, and added a strong comparative dimension to the study of Kabbalah. Idel's prolific scholarship is based on outstanding mastery of kabbalistic literary output (in manuscript and in print), an interest in comparative analysis, and an interdisciplinary breadth. His numerous studies share a distinct methodology, a set of concerns, and a theory about the place of Kabbalah in Judaism, all of which are illustrated in the book under consideration. Precisely because Idel is concerned with the details of kabbalistic texts, he sees Kabbalah as neither monolithic nor monochromatic. Rather, Kabbalah is a variegated, multivocal literary tradition that reflects the creative imagination and idiosyncratic religious experiences of its producers. The scholar of Kabbalah, 187</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews according to Idel, should consult as many texts as possible, identify their thematic resonance and interrelations, and highlight the development of literary motifs over time. Although the scholar should study Kabbalah comparatively, the scholar must not explain Kabbalah simply by noting external "influences." Most importantly, the scholar must not impose any contemporary ideology or intellectual schema on the kabbalistic texts, whether psychoanalysis (Freudian or Jungian), structural ism, poststructuralism, or feminism. The latter in particular is deemed inappropri ate for the interpretation of Kabbalah, either when it reads "feminist triumphalism" into kabbalistic texts or, conversely, when it highlights Kabbalah's inherent andro centrism, which makes it vulnerable to feminist critique. Eschewing any form of ideological dogmatism, Idel jealously guards the autonomy of Kabbalah against potential distortions of its meaning. The temptation to apply feminist or psychoanalytic paradigms to Kabbalah is especially strong with regard to the subject matter of this book?sex, sexuality, and gender. In Kabbalah and Eros, Idel illustrates how these topics should be studied?presumably, without ideological biases and prejudices. Idel is familiar with all of the existing scholarship about sex and gender in Kabbalah, citing its major contributors by name (12) and referring to their works in his notes and in bibliography. Yet Idel takes issue with several interpreters. For example, Idel cri ticizes Gershom Scholem's inability to see that Knesset Israel functioned as a hypostasis in the rabbinic corpus (29-30) and Raphael Patai's treatment of the figure of Lilith in the Zoharic corpus (135-36). Likewise, he is critical of Arthur Green's and Peter Sch?fer 's claims that the kabbalistic cult of the Shechi nah reflects the impact of the cult of Mary that emerged in twelfth-century France (45-49). More polemically, he argues against Elliot R. Wolfson's reading of kab balistic texts, especially the Zohar, in light of the feminist reworking of Lacanian psychoanalysis articulated by Luce Irigaray (97-103, 128-34). He also dismisses the views of David Biale and R. Z. Werblowsky, who regard the kabbalistic dis courses on sex and sexuality as expressions of ascetic mentality (224-33). In short, the purpose of Kabbalah and Eros is to set the record straight, so to speak, about Kabbalah, both because sexuality is so central to the kabbalistic worldview and because of the recent scholarly interest in sexuality in Kabbalah. Eros, however, is not the exclusive provenance of Kabbalah. According to Idel, Judaism is "a culture of eros" (5, 69), and Kabbalah only manifested and intensified the erotic impulses of Judaism. However, the phrase "culture of eros" is rather vague, as eros connotes a range of related concepts: desire, attrac tion, passion, seduction, lust, love, affection, friendship, pleasure, and enjoyment. The book does not offer a conceptual analysis of the differences among them but instead offers taxonomy of "types of eroticism" in kabbalistic texts. Chapter 1 documents the emergence of the feminine power in Judaism and argues that the symbolism of the Shekhinah in medieval Kabbalah should be understood not as a Jewish response to the twelfth-century cult of Mary but as an elaboration of prekabbalistic hypostatic notions of Knesset Israel. Chapter 2 analyzes the various expressions of androgeneity in Jewish mystical texts, high lighting the similarities and differences between the Platonic version of andro geneity and the kabbalistic variants. Chapter 3 discusses the relationship 188</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews between ethnoeroticism and theoeroticism, namely, "the erotic dramas taking place between the human community and the divine sphere" (104) in which Israel is both "a corporate personality and a feminine counterpart of God" (105), that is, when Israel functions as God's concubine. Chapter 4 examines the principle of "metastasis," namely, the transformation of reality in the human and divine spheres by looking at the history of a tale told by R. Isaac of Acre (four teenth century). Chapter 5 focuses on cosmoeroticism, namely, the notion that "all entities in the world, not only humans, participate in the erotic impulse" (179). In this chapter, the interplay between philosophy and Kabbalah is most evident, especially in the ecstatic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia. The final chapter, "Con cluding Remarks," organizes the evidence of the previous five chapters into three "models" in an attempt to generalize about Kabbalah, notwithstanding its resist ance to generalizations. The book includes an appendix in which Idel examines additional kabbalis tic texts that undermine attempts to read Kabbalah through the lens of feminist critique. Though he admits that Kabbalah did not improve the status of women in Jewish society, Idel adduces evidence of egalitarian intentions in kabbalistic texts, the efficacy of female intention {kavanah) in the reproductive process, and even the association of the demonic with the male "while the power that is capable of purifying it is that of the female" (250). The organization of the book is meant to illustrate the methodology: Gener alizations about Kabbalah should only be derived inductively on the basis of textual evidence. However, Idel's taxonomy is by no means neat. In some cases, the object of desire (God, Israel, or Torah) determines the type of eroticism, whereas in other cases, an aspect of the erotic orientation (e.g., androgeneity or the time and place most propitious for sexual activity) defines the type of eroticism. Furthermore, some types of eroticism (i.e., "biblioeroticism," "chronoeroticism," and "tempoeroticism") are merely mentioned without receiving sufficient expo sition. More problematic is the fact that the final chapter organizes the data into three major models?"theurgic-theosophic," "ecstatic," and "talismanic"?even though these models are already presupposed in the analysis of the data in Chap ters 1-5. Because Idel's numerous works have shown that these models, or "rela tively solid structures," cut across the history of Kabbalah, the book would have been easier to follow had it been organized according to these three models rather than the various themes of the book: the existence of the feminine aspect of God, the dynamic of androgeneity, Israel as God's concubine, the transformative power of eros, and love as a cosmic principle. Be that as it may, the very identification of models in the final chapter proves that Idel also generalizes about Kabbalah, as generalizations are unavoidable in historical reconstruction. Though the strength of the book lies in its close reading of select texts, certain arguments about the place of eros in Kabbalah and in Judaism generally emerge from Idel's analysis. First, Judaism cannot be simplistically understood as a monotheistic religion. Rather, Judaism harbors a ditheistic or binitarian impulse from the earliest rabbinic times. The God of Israel is not the God of the philosophers, a noncorporeal intellect engaged in self-contemplation, but a passio nate God whose tumultuous inner life is dominated by the dynamics of 189</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews androgeneity and by his relationship with Israel, the concubine of God. Second, except for a few notable exceptions (i.e., some Sabbatean sects and Frankism), Kabbalah did not function as a subversive force in Judaism but rather as a force that deepened the commitment of Jews to halakhic norms. In Kabbalah, erotic energy is expressed within and strengthens the institution of marriage, deepening the halakhic obligation imposed on husbands to satisfy their wives' sexual needs. Third, the erotic impulse of Kabbalah, especially in the theosophic-theurgic Kabba lah, explains how Kabbalah empowered its practitioners and why this tradition enhanced Judaism. Through their ritualized sexual acts with the proper intention, Jews believed they could participate in God's inner life and bring about the redemp tive unification of the male and the female aspects of God. Fourth, although Kabbalah absorbed the influences of other religious traditions and schools of thought, it is also different from them and should be understood on its own terms. On the whole, though the book rejects feminist methodology, especially the distinction between sex and gender (97), it actually confirms a feminist insight: Idel's analysis of kabbalistic imaginaire gives us only the male perspective. Even if kabbalists included female intention in the sexual act, as Idel claims, women's desire, intentionality, imagination, and concerns remain inaccessible to us. Kabbalah was produced by men and for men, reflecting the sensibilities of men. Although the book's title and the author's reputation will attract many readers, it is doubtful that this book could be understood by the general public. The nonspecialist might find many interesting and insightful comments but will get lost in the myriad details and technical vocabulary. The intended audience of this book is other scholars of Kabbalah, who will understand Idel's method of reading kabbalistic texts (best exemplified in Chapter 4) and who can assess his debates with other interpreters of Kabbalah. Kabbalah and Eros is an import ant contribution to contemporary study of Kabbalah, but it should not be regarded as the final word on sex, sexuality, and gender in Kabbalah or in Judaism.
