Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press; Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2005. xvi, 447 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001177 After decades of research in Holocaust studies, it is surprising how little we know about what happened to the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia during World War II. Livia Rothkirchen's new monograph is the most substantial book on the topic in English and thus offers a very useful gateway to further reading and research. The book begins with the paradox that the Holocaust was as horribly thorough in Bohemia and Moravia, as in other lands, despite the Czechs' repu tation for tolerance. This premise of Czech tolerance informs the entire work and is the source of both its strengths and weaknesses. The book's early chapters support the idea of a special Czech-Jewish relationship based on "centuries-old spiritual ties between Czechs and Jews" (xii, 5). The prologue cites liturgy, legends, and literature to illustrate the interest of Czech religious leaders and intellectuals in the Jewish Bible, but these sources say little about Czech attitudes toward actual Jews. The first chapter adds a selec tive review often centuries of Bohemian history, with an emphasis on moments of coexistence. The second chapter follows with a useful recapitulation of what is known about Jews in the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918-38). On the whole, however, Zionism is overemphasized in the book's early chapters, which seek partially to support the prologue's claim: "There is a distinct symmetry between [the] Czech and Jewish renascence unparalleled between other nations, augmented by the unique role played throughout history by both Prague and Jer usalem as citadels of national struggle and fulfillment" (2). By contrast, subsequent chapters effectively challenge this rosy picture of Czech-Jewish relations. In Chapter 3, Rothkirchen vividly recounts the vicious rise of Czech antisemitism after the 1938 Munich Pact and ably describes its ter rifying impact on Jews. She is especially scathing in her treatment of Ferdinand Peroutka, the great liberal publicist and onetime proponent of Jewish assimilation, who became an accomplice in the 1938 wave of antisemitism. The excellent fourth chapter, "Under German Occupation," describes the fate of the protectorate's Jews 209</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews as they were isolated from society, marked, and deported. The author could have said more about Czech participation in this process?for example, the role that Czech gendarmes and ordinary people played in the roundups and arrests of Jews. Still, the chapter represents the first English-language history, and one of the best in any language, to capture the process that brought Jews to the camps. Chapter 6 offers yet more material for critics of Edvard Benes, who appears to have gone out of his way to deny the extent and horror of the ongoing Holo caust. Despite reports from the Czech underground and international sources, Benes repeatedly minimized the threat to Czechoslovak and European Jewry and, in May 1943, even expressed the "conviction that we would find more Jews alive after this war than we think." This opinion was based on the almost cer tainly disingenuous claim that small-town Jews had avoided deportation and that the Germans would not have enough time to "exterminate" Jews imprisoned in camps and ghettos (181). By contrast, the Czechoslovak National Council con demned the antisemitic crimes of the Nazis. The critical eye that Rothkirchen casts on the Second Republic and Benes is not applied equally to the protectorate government or to the occupied Czechs in general. Chapter 5, "The Protectorate Government and the 'Final Solution,'" has only a brief and largely exculpatory discussion of the Czech administration's contribution to antisemitic measures. The author dismisses protectorate premier Alois Elias 's plans to seize Jewish property as an effort to keep Czech land out of German hands, even though he twice endorsed a law "for the defense of Czech Aryan honor and blood" (149). Rothkirchen is generous in her assessment of the Czech leader: "While we have no solid information about Elias 's personal attitude toward the Jewish community, we may surmise that as an enlightened Czech patriot and former member of the 'Truth Prevails' Freemason Lodge, he had no prejudice" (142). On the whole, the chapter repeats the standard narrative of elite Czech collaboration but provides little information about organized Czech participation in the persecution of Jews, for example, by groups such as the fascist Vlajka movement or the Anti-Je wish League. The rest of the book hints at Czech participation in the Holocaust, but these threads are generally left hanging. Chapter 6 briefly mentions the antisemitic mood among the occupied Czechs, in particular a widespread belief that the Jews were getting what they deserved in light of their past enthusiasm for Germa nization (184). Chapter 7, which focuses on Jewish resistance, does not follow up on its interesting claim that mainstream underground groups were reluctant to include Jews in their ranks and did not engage in any concerted effort to inhibit antisemitic persecution. Chapter 8 notes that there were relatively few "righteous" Czech saviors but does not provide a number or explain why there were so few. Chapter 9, "Gateway to Death," mentions the presence of Czech gendarmes at the Terezin Ghetto, including one particularly sadistic captain, but does not inves tigate who they were or what they did to assist (or inhibit) Nazi crimes. The book is similarly circumspect when it comes to the horrific moral predicament faced by the ghetto's Jewish leaders. Rothkirchen only devotes a paragraph to the dilemma of Jews selecting Jews for deportation (238-39) and does not further explore the activities of the Transport or Appeals committees. 210</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Chapter 9 is strongest in its portrayal of the politics that animated and divided the ghetto's Jewish leaders. In addition to splits between assimilationists, traditional ists, and Zionists, Rothkirchen describes national conflicts within the camp, especially between the better-positioned Czechs and the still disliked Germans. Much of the chapter is devoted to a scathing indictment of the Red Cross?an old story, but one worth repeating. Chapter 10, finally, "The Spiritual Legacy of the Terezin Inmates," presents a strong case for the special role that art, music, and education played in the camp: "culture became the elixir of life for the ghetto inmates" (265). This section gets at the heart of what made Terezin different and includes a valuable assessment of what was and was not accomplished within the ghetto's walls: "It is interesting to note that no really outstanding works of prose emerged" (269). Ultimately, the book tries to do too much, an understandable pitfall facing any pioneering work. Rothkirchen nonetheless deserves praise for drawing atten tion to this important topic and for pointing out directions for further research.
