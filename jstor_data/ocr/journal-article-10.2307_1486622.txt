<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED by HOWARD KREISEL I There is probably no topic in Maimonides' philosophy more thoroughly explored than that of human perfection, many of the studies dealing explicitly with the notion of imitatio Dei. Maimonides' view of ultimate perfection has been interpreted alternatively as primarily either intellectual, political, ethical, or halakhic.' Many have interpreted Maimonides as positing a harmonious combination of the contemplative life and the life of socially oriented ac- tivity-bios praktikos--despite the evident tension between the two.2 Others have explained the apparent inconsistency in Maimonides' approach in terms 1. For the extensive literature dealing with this topic, see the notes and bibliography in Menachem Kellner, Maimnonides on Human Peifection (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990). See also Ira Robinson, Lawrence Kaplan, and Julien Bauer, eds., The Thought of Moses Mainmonides (Lewiston, N.Y.: Edwin Mellen Press, 1990), particularly the articles by Warren Harvey, Alfred Ivry, David Shatz, and Lawrence Kaplan; and Joel Kraemer, ed., Perspectives on Maimonides (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), particularly the articles by Lawrence Berman, Ralph Lerner, and Steven Harvey. I am indebted to Dr. Hannah Kasher of Bar-Ilan University for sending me an advance copy of her forthcoming book in Hebrew on Maimonides and inmitatio Dei. This work has provided me with many valuable insights and references. For the philosophic background of the concept of Imitatio Dei in Jewish philosophy, see Alexander Altmann and S. M. Stem, Isaac Israeli (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1958), pp. 197-200; and Lawrence Berman, "The Political Interpretation of the Maxim: The Purpose of Philosophy is the imitation of God," Studia Islantica 15 (1961): 53-61. For a general discussion of this topic in Jewish thought, see David Shapiro, "The Doctrine of the Image of God and Imitatio Dei," Judaism 12 (1963): 57-77 (reprinted in Menachem Kellner, ed., Contemporal)y Jewish Ethics [New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978], pp. 127-51). 2.

The challenge facing the student of Maimonides' thought, however, lies not only in explicating the individual texts which deal in a direct manner with the topic, but also in identifying all the issues and texts which are relevant to the topic, as well as their sources, and how they are related. The position I shall argue in this study is that Maimonides' view of human perfection as it emerges from the Guide of the Perplexed, and his approach to imnitatio Dei in the context of this topic, is in fact a harmonious combination, at least in its essential features, of intellectual perfection and bios praktikos. Moreover, it is integrally rooted in Maimonides' metaphysical views concerning God and the Separate Intellects, as well as his doctrine concerning the movement of the spheres. The key to understanding his view is his notion of "emanation" or "overflow" (Ar. faid, Heb. shefa'), a notion which is presented by Maimonides not only in relation to the activity of God and the supernal world, but also the prophets.4 This is not to say, however, that all the inconsistencies in Maimonides' approach are more apparent than real. While Maimonides purposefully intro- duced inconsistencies into his treatise due to the religious sensitivity of the subject in question or for pedagogical reasons, as his introductory remarks in the Guide indicate, not all the inconsistencies in his approach, if not outright contradictions, should be explained in this manner-his view to the contrary notwithstanding.5 It is important to keep in mind that the Guide is Studies 2 (1972): 24. Altmann's subsequent article, "Maimonides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics," in his Von der imittelalterlichen zur modernen Aujklaerung (Tubingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1987), pp. 60-129, is perhaps the most significant study written on the topic of Maimonides' view of human perfection. 3. See, for example, Shlomo Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge According to Al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja, and Maimonides," in Isadore Twersky, ed., Studies in Medieval Jewish History, and Literature (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University, 1979), pp. 82-109. 4. I have presented this position in a summary manner in "Maimonides' View of Prophecy as the Overflowing Perfection of Man," Daat 13 (1984): xxi-xxvi. This basic position has already been advanced by Warren Harvey, "Political Philosophy and Halakhah in Maimonides" [Heb.], lyyun 29 (1980): 209-212.

Maimonides repeatedly refers his readers to the extensive philosophic literature on these subjects, which he treats as mandatory reading for those striving to attain perfection. Rather, the Guide is a theological-exegetical work devoted to a solution to the dilemmas which arise from a broad comparison between Jewish tradition and Islamic Aristotelian philosophy (Guide 1:introduction, 2:2). Maimonides nowhere presents his own world-view in full, and it is at least questionable whether he ever sought to develop his own philosophy in a systematic manner. Maimonides certainly accepts the Aristotelian approach to understanding existence in most of its essentials, an acceptance already discernible in his earliest writings.6 He wavers, however, between different individual Harav Kook, 1972). Herbert Davidson, in his "Maimonides' Secret Position on Creation," in Twersky, Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, pp. 16-40, maintains that the esoteric-exoteric distinction fails in regard to some of the contradictions in the Guide (most notably the problem of creation), which may in fact be inadvertent. While I do not agree with his analysis attempting to show that Maimonides adopts a Platonic view of creation, I think that his view of contradictions in Maimonides' philosophy is essentially correct. One certainly cannot demonstrate that some of the contradictions in the Guide are not intentional. Those convinced that Maimonides introduced only purposeful contradictions, as he himself testifies, can always produce arguments to the contrary, as Davidson notes. However, the willingness (if with reluctance) to acquiesce to the possibility that not all the contradictions or inconsistencies are of this nature protects us from exaggerated attempts to "reconcile" all the contradictions (imagined or otherwise) along esoteric-exoteric lines or seek out some deeper level of harmony by the use of farfetched hermeneutics-attempts which at times appear to make a caricature of the text. I am not arguing against the notion that many of the contradictions should be interpreted along esoteric-exoteric lines for I think they should. I also think that the "harmonists," who seek to reconcile apparent contradictions by attempting to show that no real contradictions are in fact involved, are at times correct. Maimonides occasionally emphasizes seemingly conflicting aspects of what is essentially a coherent picture. Overall, I see no reason why a multifaceted approach should not be adopted to understand this multifaceted work. What ultimately determines one's reading of any given topic must be a careful analysis of the issues and texts involved, together with one's sense of the text. Admittedly, my argument in this study may often be viewed as impressionistic, lacking the careful analysis of all the texts and issues involved which are necessary to establish my point. My objective is to offer the bare outline of a way for understanding Maimonides' work as it is reflected by his views pertaining to a central topic, taken together with the problems that these views raise. 6.

In some issues he appears to mediate between the philosophers' approach and traditional Jewish views (e.g., the problem of miracles and nature [Guide 2:29]), leaving, however, certain critical questions unanswered (e.g., what is God's precise role vis-h-vis specific miracles).7 He fails to address these problems explicitly perhaps for reasons of esotericism, or perhaps because he had not answered them fully to his own satisfaction. Even where it appears that Maimonides rejects outright the philosophers' views, most notably the view of a primordial universe, his presentation is far from unequivocal, suggesting that he may have held an esoteric doctrine.8 Yet here too it may be the case that Maimonides never arrived at a final conclusion despite his realization of the philosophical- theological "stakes" involved.9 In general, Maimonides provides a basic framework for a solution to the issues with which he deals, perhaps sensing many of the problems which remain whose details he had not fully worked out. His work has a jigsaw-puzzle quality, but even after leaving out all the "extraneous" pieces-those not reflecting Maimonides' true views-all the others do not necessarily fit smoothly together. The Guide should be viewed as the product of an author in the process of thinking and rethinking some of the important issues he discusses, even while writing his work. In developing his conception of God, the world, and humanity, Maimonides read his philosophical predecessors and wrestled with their views, often reinterpreting traditional Jewish sources to agree with his conclusions. He chose between alternative conceptions, incorporating certain views while rejecting others. The precise relation between the views adopted by Maimonides is not always immediately evident, nor are they all easily reconcilable. It appears that though 7.

Plato's Republic, Aristotle's De Anima and Nicomachean Ethics, to- gether with the works of some of his commentators, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias, and an abridged version of Plotinus' Enneads, The Theology of Aristotle, entered into the Islamic world,10 and had a decisive influence on the conceptions of human perfection found in the various schools of thought-theological and mystical as well as philosophical-which in turn influenced the Jewish thinkers. The philosophy of Alfarabi, followed by that of Avicenna and Ibn Bajja, had a particularly sharp impress upon Maimonides' thought." Clearly any attempt to develop a conception of human perfection and inzitatio Dei drawing upon the Greek and Islamic philosophical sources had to address a range of questions concerning God and the essence of the human soul, questions on which these sources were hardly unanimous or unequivocal in their answers. What does it mean for the individual to assimilate himself to God? Is God to be conceived as Intellect or as the wholly Unfathomable One? What is God's relation to the world? Is union with God or any of the beings of the metaphysical realm possible, and if so what is the nature of this union and under what conditions does it occur? What is the nature of the human soul? Is the soul immortal, or can it at least attain immortality, and if so what characterizes its immortal state? What level of intellection is the individual capable of attaining and what is the implication of this for evaluating his ontological status? What is the relation between intellection and the practical virtues in regard to the individual's ultimate perfection and happiness? Is the perfect individual a ruler or a person who isolates himself from mankind as far as possible? What is prophecy and how is it related to human perfection? Not only do the medieval philosophers, while sharing certain fundamental conceptions in common, differ among themselves on the answers to these questions, but not always do their answers 10. See F E. Peters, Aristotle and the Arabs (New York: New York University Press, 1968). 11.

Any attempt to understand the notion of imitatio Dei in Maimonides' philosophy can hardly ignore the various issues to which this notion is integrally related. Moreover, Maimonides had to grapple also with biblical pronouncements bearing on this topic, together with their rabbinic interpreta- tions, such as God's demand to be holy just as He is holy (Lev. 11:44, 19:2). I have already indicated that there is a fundamental coherence in the picture of human perfection which underlies Maimonides' philosophy, but that not all the inconsistencies in his approach can be easily reconciled or should be. Maimonides understood that the fundamental set of problems underlying human perfection is the nature of intellect and its relation to the human soul and body on one hand, and its relation to God and the Active Intellect on the other. Yet it is precisely to this set of problems that Maimonides presents a tentative solution at best.12 God in Maimonides' thought is Pure Intellect (Guide 1:68), yet the completely simple and unfathomable One to whom no positive attributes may be attributed (1:56-60). He is both Wisdom and Will, which are identical with His essence (1:69). He is the wholly transcendent God, not dependent upon any other existent nor even related to any other existent (1:52), who nevertheless is the Cause--efficient, formal, and final-of all existence (1:69). All the problems emerging from this paradoxical conception of God are ultimately resolved by the complete "otherness" of His existence, which can only be known by what He is not or by what He does.'" How can a human being 12. For an analysis of Maimonides' view of the intellect, see Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect." 13. This in itself is a problematic solution, for in the final analysis Maimonides has a great deal to say about God. See Julius Guttmann, "Maimonides' Theology" [Heb.], in I. Epstein, E. Levine, and C. Roth, eds., Essays in Honour of J. H. Herir (London: Edward Goldston, 1942), pp. 53-69 (Heb. sec.), repr. in his Reason and Knowledge [Heb.], ed. S.H. Bergman and N. Rotenstreich (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1979), pp. 103-118. The tension between the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian strains in Maimonides' philosophy has recently been analyzed by Alfred Ivry, "Maimonides and Neoplatonism: Challenge and Response," in Lenn E. Goodman, ed., Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), pp. 137-156.</page><page sequence="7">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 175 "imitate" the totally other? Maimonides was not the first to wrestle with the problem. Plotinus dealt with the question explicitly in his Enneads 1.2, though his probing discussion does not appear to have been known to the Islamic philosophers.14 So did a number of Maimonides' medieval Jewish philosophic predecessors.' A similar question is found in some of Maimonides' rabbinic sources, though there is certainly no reason to maintain that the conception with which they grappled was that of a completely transcendent God as understood by the philosophers. The rabbinic answer suggests that God can be imitated only by His attributes. "To walk in all His ways" (Deut. ll:22)-These are the ways of God [lit.: the Place]: "The Lord! a God compassionate and gracious ..." (Exod 34:6).16 And it is written: "Whoever shall call [read: be called] by the name of the Lord shall escape" (Joel 3:5).17 How is it possible for man to be called by the name of God? Rather, just as God is called "compassionate," so should you be compassionate; just as the Holy One, blessed be He, is called "gracious," so should you be gracious ... and give free gifts to all ... (Sifre, 'Ekevy 49).18 Abba Saul says: Ve-'anvehu [and adorn Him] (Exod 15:2)-be like (domieh) Him.'9 Just as He is gracious and compassionate, so you shall be gracious and compassionate. (B.T. Shabbat 133b) Both in the Book of the Commandments: positive commandment no. 8, and in the Mishneh Torah: Laws of Character Traits 1:6, Maimonides refers to the source in the Sifre in interpreting the commandment to "walk in God's ways" (Deut. 28:9). For Maimonides, to walk in His ways means nothing 14. See Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp. 198-199. 15. See, for example, Joseph Ibn Zaddik, Book of the Microcosm [Heb.), ed. S. Horovitz (Breslau, 1903), p. 65. Maimonides, however, confesses not to have read Joseph's work. See Isaac Shailat, ed. and trans., Letters and Essays of Moses Maimonides [Arabic and Heb.] (Maaleh Adumim: Maaliyot Press, 1988), p. 552. 16. The midrash apparently connects this verse with Moses' request in Exod. 33:13 to be informed of God's "ways." Maimonides too regards this verse as the answer to Moses' request there. 17. The phrase "call by the name of the Lord" appears also in Exod 34:5, providing the connection between the two verses. 18.

His discussion even suggests that they are not related to God in any way, but are ascribed by the prophets to God simply to indicate that these are the attributes that man should acquire.2' In his Laws of the Principles of the Torah 1:11, Maimonides explicitly rejects the notion that God possesses character traits, together with any other attribute characterizing corporeal entities, a notion which in all probability does not underlie his rabbinic sources. His interpretation there of the revelation granted Moses (1:10) suggests that Moses learned God's negative attributes, i.e., all the attributes characterizing other existents which are to be negated of God. Yet there is no indication how the content of this revelation serves as a model for human activity and perfection.22 20. The Mishneh Torah, however, only mentions character traits. For a comparison between these two sources, see Walter Wurzberger, "Imitatio Dei in Maimonides' Sefer Hamnitzvot and the Mishneh Torah," in Jonathan Sacks, ed., Tradition and Transition: Essays Presented to Chief Rabbi Sirt Immanuel Jakobovits (London: Jews College, 1986), pp. 321-324. 21. Hannah Kasher argues this point in her forthcoming study. It should be noted that Maimonides says that "man must conduct himself in accordance with them [the attributes] and imitate Him (le-hiddanmot 'elav) to the extent of his ability." The term 'elav, however, does not appear in most of the manuscripts, though it appears in almost all of the printed versions. A similar phrase occurs in Laws of Slaves 9:8, where we are commanded to act mercifully with heathen slaves in accordance with the just laws of the Torah. "So too in regard to the attributes of God which we are commanded to imitate (le-hiddamot ba-henm), it is written: 'And His mercy is upon all His works' (Ps. 145:8)." There is a hint in this passage that Maimonides treats the attributes as attributes of action. 22. The notion of imitation of God occurs in still other passages of the Mishneh Torah. Notable is the reference in Laws of Megillah 2:17. Maimonides rules that it is preferable on Purim to spend more on gifts to the poor than on the meal and presents to friends, "for he who gladdens the hearts of these unfortunates imitates the Divine Presence." In this context, one imitates divine activity by a human activity improving the state of those who are lacking and require assistance. In performing this command, one is, in a sense, imitating divine governance of that which is below Him. This notion foreshadows an essential aspect of Maimonides' approach to inmitatio Dei in the Guide. For a detailed discussion of this passage, see Gerald Blidstein, "The Concept of Joy in Maimonides" [Heb.], Eshel Beer-Sheva 2 (1980): 145-164; Isadore Twersky, "On Law and Ethics in the Mishnelh Torah: A Case Study of Hilkhot Megillah II: 17," Tradition 24 (1989): 138-149; and Lawrence Kaplan, "Hilkhot Megillah 2:17 Revisited: A Halakhic Analysis," Tradition 26 (1991): 14-21. The notion of imitatio Dei also appears in Laws of Imnpure Foods 16:12, where it is regarded as a consequence of holiness. For a discussion of the relation between these two notions, see the appendix to this article.</page><page sequence="9">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 177 Maimonides' crucial discussion of inmitatio Dei in Guide 1:54, also refers to the source in the Sifre, but with several significant additions. Here he regards the attributes as pertaining to God, but as attributes of action. Maimonides explains that Moses was denied any knowledge of God's essence, a position in keeping with his negative theology, but was granted knowledge of His actions-i.e., the totality of existence created by Him and His governance of the world. Maimonides goes on to indicate, Scripture has restricted itself to mentioning only those thirteen characteristics, although [Moses] apprehended all His goodness-I mean to say all His actions-because these are the actions proceeding from Him, may He be exalted, in respect of giving existence to the Adamites and governing them. This was [Moses'] ultimate object in his demand, the conclusion of what he says being: That I may know Thee, to the end that I may find grace in Thy sight and consider that this nation is Thy people (Exod. 33:13) - that is, a people for the government of which I need to perform actions that I must seek to make similar to Thy actions in governing them. (pp. 124-125) Maimonides' answer suggests that perfect political leadership, a leadership "translating" knowledge of physics and metaphysics into a set of rules and directives for human society, is the ultimate human expression of imitatio Dei.23 The perfection of the intellect is regarded by Maimonides as a necessary condition-a thorough understanding of reality being required for directing society to pursue mankind's true good-but it is not the end in itself. Nor does Maimonides refer here, in contradistinction to his legal writings, to the individual's own ethical perfection,24 though this is a necessary condition 23. The "political" interpretation of inzitatio Dei in Maimonides has been argued most forcefully by Lawrence Berman in his doctoral dissertation and in a series of articles. See his final study on the subject, "The Ethical Views of Maimonides Within the Context of Islamicate Civilization," in Harvey et al., Perspectives on Mainionides, pp. 13-32. Maimonides appears to be hinting that the Law itself is the product of Moses' imitation of God. See Alvin Reines, "Maimonides' Concept of Mosaic Prophecy," Hebrew Union College Annual 40 (1969): 350 f.; and Kalman Bland, "Moses and the Law According to Maimonides," in J. Reinharz and D. Swetschinski, eds., Mystics, Philosophers and Politicians (Durham: Duke University Press, 1982), pp. 49-66. 24. In the earlier chapters of the Guide, Maimonides' approach to initatio Dei is too general to determine whether the stress is on ethics or politics. In 1:24.54, the term "to walk," as it appears in the commandment which serves as the basis for imitatio Dei-"And you shall walk in His ways" (Deut. 28:9)-is interpreted by Maimonides simply as "living a good life."</page><page sequence="10">178 HOWARD KREISEL for achieving intellectual perfection, as well as integral to perfect leadership. A person who is a slave to his passions can hardly attain intellectual perfection or lead others to their perfection.25 Though Maimonides deals with Moses, he is quite explicit in treating Moses as a paradigm case.26 Moses' characteristics serve as the model for every prophetic ruler-governance in accord with reason freed from all feelings of emotion. This is Maimonides' characterization of God's governance. Non-prophets too must attempt to approach this ideal in the context of their own social situation, and in accordance with their ability. Maimonides' concluding remarks in Guide 3:54 refer to the same ideal, as his reference there to 1:54 indicates. After positing the perfection of the intellect as the ultimate perfection of man, and explicating Jeremiah 9:22-23 accordingly,27 Maimonides adds, For when explaining in this verse the noblest ends, he does not limit them only to the apprehension of Him. .... But he says that one should glory in the apprehension of Myself and in the knowledge of My attributes, by which he means His actions. . . In this verse he makes it clear to us that those actions that ought to be known and imitated are loving-kindness, judgemnent and righteousness. He adds another corrobarative notion through saying, in the In 1:38.87 Maimonides interprets the phrase "walk at the back of the Lord" as "following in obedience to Him and imitating His acts and conducting life in accordance with His conduct." 25. See, for example, 1:34, 2:36, 3:33. Maimonides at times regards the ethical traits as necessary only for the establishment and preservation of society. At other times he treats them as related directly to the attainment of intellectual perfection. I have dealt with this issue in a recent study, "Individual Perfection vs. Communal Welfare and the Problem of Contradictions in Maimonides' Approach to Ethics," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 58 (1992): 107-141. 26. Maimonides consistently treats Moses as having attained the highest level of perfection, but alternately treats Moses' perfection as paradigmatic and exceptional. Maimonides' position can be traced to the context of his discussion. When his discussion has a bearing on establishing the uniqueness of the Torah, Maimonides treats Moses' attainment as exceptional and outside the boundaries of nature. Thus Moses' perfection cannot be imitated by the laying down of new legislation. When Maimonides' discussion turns to final human perfection, on the other hand, he presents Moses as the paradigm case. One can never hope to equal Moses' theoretical and practical virtues, but he represents the model that one strives to approach. 27. For a study of the interpretations of this passage in medieval Jewish philosophy, see Abraham Melamed, "Philosophical Commentaries to Jeremiah 9, 22-23 in Medieval and Renaissance Jewish Thought" [Heb.], Jerusalenm Studies in Jewish Thought 4 (1984-85): 31-82.</page><page sequence="11">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 179 earth-this being a pivot of the Law. ... Then he completes the notion by saying: For in these things I delight saith the Lord. He means that it is My purpose that there should come from you loving-kindness, righteousness, and judgement in the earth in the way we have explained with regard to the thirteen attributes: namely, that the purpose should be assimilation (tashabbuh) to them and that this should be our way of life. (p. 637) This is one part of the picture of human perfection corresponding to one aspect of Maimonides' conception of God. God, however, is not only the wise ruler who through an act of will gives existence to what is other than He and organizes the order of existence in a flawless manner-imitatio Dei consequently lying in the perfection of our own activities and the virtues underlying them, particularly in the realm of politics. God's essence is intellect. Maimonides, for all his insistence on the equivocality of the term "intellect," never frees himself from this basic Aristotelian conception, neither in the Guide nor in his legal writings.28 Intellection for Maimonides, no less than for Aristotle, is what characterizes divinity. To the degree that man engages in intellection, he approaches divinity. Maimonides himself explains the notion of approaching God as "union (ittisal) in knowledge and drawing near through apprehension" (Guide 1:18.44), a notion which is reiterated in 1:54. Thus despite the unbridgeable chasm between God's intellect and the human intellect, it is intellect which provides the point of resemblance and "contact." Already in Guide 1:1, Maimonides develops this point. In explicating the term demut ("likeness") as it appears in Genesis 1:26 ("Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"), Maimonides comments, As for the term likeness, it is a noun derived from the verb damoh [to be like], and it too signifies likeness in respect of a notion. .... Now man possesses as his proprium something in him that is very strange as it is not found in anything else that exists under the sphere of the moon, namely, intellectual apprehension. In the exercise of this, no sense, no part of the body, none of the extremities are used; and therefore this apprehension was likened unto the apprehension of the deity, which does not require an instrument, although in reality it is not like the latter apprehension, but only appears so to the first stirrings of opinion.

(pp. 22-23) Many of the tensions in Maimonides' conception of God, as well as in his view of imitatio Dei, emerge from this passage. God is said to possess apprehension, though totally unlike human apprehension.29 Hence by means of intellectual apprehension man in some way resembles God, though he can never in fact resemble God at all. I do not think that Maimonides ever fully resolved this tension. Yet he leaves no doubt in this passage that the intellect is in some significant sense "divine." The intellect to which he is referring, as the following chapter of the Guide clarifies, is the theoretical intellect. By means of this intellect, humans distinguish between truth and falsehood, i.e., attain knowledge of the sciences culminating in the knowledge of God.30 Maimonides treats the possession of this intellect in full as Adam's "ultimate perfection," on account of which it is said that Adam was created "in the image of God and in His likeness." The treatment of ultimate perfection as the perfection of the theoretical intellect reemerges in several critical passages in the Guide.3' It is also a point that Maimonides maintains in some of his legal writings, most notably in the Mishneh Torah: Laws of the Principles of the Torah 3:8-13.32 Moreover, in 29. The term "intellect," in other words, is used equivocally, leading many of the medievals as well as moderns to wonder what sense this term has when applied to God. It should be noted that both in his legal writings and in the Guide Maimonides introduces a subtle but crucial distinction between two groups of essential attributes. One group, all the attributes which necessarily denote corporeality, Maimonides completely negates in reference to God. A second group-life, power, knowledge, will-is not, however, completely negated of God, but treated as existing in Him in a totally "different sense" than they exist in us. In Laws of the Principles of the Torah 1:11, for example, Maimonides negates from God all the categories pertaining to matter, as well as affections of the soul, without qualification, but negates from God life "like the life of the living body" and wisdom "like the wisdom of the wise man."

Yet it is precisely between these two approaches to perfection, both which are rooted in his conception of God, that Maimonides appears to waver in the Guide. III The immediate question which arises is, why should these two approaches to perfection be regarded as inconsistent? Certainly no one disagrees that perfect political activity for Maimonides requires a perfect theoretical as well as prac- tical intellect, in keeping with the Platonic tradition of the philosopher-king. Even those who interpret Maimonides as positing a different form of practical activity as the ultimate perfection (e.g., ethical, halakhic) stress the importance of theoretical knowledge in guiding the individual not only to the performance of the proper activity but also to the proper state of consciousness or intent with which this activity is to be performed." Maimonides' view that theoretical perfection is necessary for practical perfection causes no difficulties in itself, R. Moses b. Maimon: Seder Nezikin [Arabic and Heb.] (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1975), p. 205; Eight Chapters.5. 33. See Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect," pp. 85-91. For a further discussion of this issue, see below. 34. This notion underlies David Hartman's "integrationist" approach to Jewish law and philosophy in Maimonides' thought in his Maimnonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest (Philadel- phia: Jewish Publication Society, 1976). A similar approach has been advanced most recently by Menachem Kellner, Maimonides on Human Peifection. I think that the integrationist approach is essentially correct but misleading. Maimonides integrates philosophy and Jewish law by making the study of philosophy a legal obligation-the leading obligation. Maimonides essentially treats the Law as a concrete expression-albeit the ultimate expression-of political philosophy, the final goal of political philosophy being theoretical perfection. This position is already advanced in his Treatise on Logic 14, and is maintained consistently throughout all his writings. The Law is framed for a particular society at large in order to bring about, or at least advance, those ends which belong to mankind as a whole. Insofar as it is framed for all of society, it can at best provide "pointers" for the attainment of theoretical perfection by dressing truths in figurative form and mandating belief in them. Maimonides was very much the disciple of Alfarabi in this area, as correctly argued by Leo Strauss and Lawrence Berman, though he went further than Alfarabi in incorporating philosophic truths in legal contexts. It is noteworthy that neither in</page><page sequence="14">182 HOWARD KREISEL any more than his view that practical perfection is necessary for theoretical, insofar as intellection requires a conducive "environment," whether it be the social environment or the disposition of one's own soul. It may be argued that far from being mutually exclusive, these two perfections are integrally related to each other. They are in fact two sides of the same coin, the attainment of either one dependent upon the attainment of the other. Yet for all the validity of this argument, a basic tension does in fact exist between these two types of perfection. The life of contemplation is in a crucial sense opposed to a life of practical activity. Both often make competing demands on one's time and effort. More important, intellectual perfection for Maimonides does not lie simply in the attainment of a certain level of knowledge, leaving open the possibility of a subsequent turning to other pursuits. Maimonides treats intellectual perfection as dynamic in nature. It entails a life of continuous uninterrupted intellection--one's felicity being dependent upon active intellection and proportionate to the level of intellection. This is how the state of immortality itself is conceived.3 Guide 1:54 nor in the conclusion of 3:54 does Maimonides identify ultimate perfection with observance of the commandments per se. The perfection he deals with in 1:54 explicitly relates to political leadership, which in the case of Moses involves the very revelation-legislation of the Law. In 3:54 Maimonides explicitly treats observance as a means to ethical perfection, with ultimate perfection residing in the practice of the actions resulting from the "divine" attributes. Maimonides does not mention the commandments in this context, for he has in mind a form of behavior which leads to the most noble action in an)y given context, rather than one which is confined to a specific set of actions. For a further discussion of this perfection, see below. 35. See, for example, Guide 2:36: 3:5 1. For Maimonides, true felicity is not a function of the feeling accompanying the process of transforming potential knowledge into actual knowledge, i.e., the pleasure which comes from the feeling of "progress" in intellection or even from the effort itself. Rather it is a function of the very act of apprehension, the level of felicity being determined by the nobility of the object of apprehension. Thus for Maimonides, the more a human progresses in his knowledge, the greater his felicity (as well as his love of God, which is also treated as a function of knowledge) not because of the progress per se, but because the greater nobility of his object of apprehension. For the sources and critique of this view, see Warren Harvey, "Crescas versus Maimonides on Knowledge and Pleasure," in R. Link-Salinger, ed., A Straight Path (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1989), pp. 118-123. It should be added that Maimonides is of the view that the perfect individuals will attain a much more elevated apprehension of the incorporeal world with the final separation of their intellects from their bodies, thereby increasing their felicity. He does not, however, believe in progress after this stage, just as there is no progress in the intellection of the celestial or Separate Intellects through all eternity. This does not bring about a gradual loss, or even diminution, of felicity. On the contrary, the unceasing, unchanging, eternal contemplation</page><page sequence="15">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 183 Moreover, it is also how God's eternal intellection of Himself is conceived (Guide 1:68). Given the equivocal relation between the human intellect and body, the diversion of one's attention to matters pertaining to corporeal existence deflects from one's intellection of the higher realities. Thus it appears that any form of practical activity cannot but bring about a loss of perfection, an interruption in the contemplative life. Why should a person who has achieved a perfect theoretical intellect choose the practical life at all if the end is theoretical perfection? Why should he not isolate himself from others to the extent possible and devote himself solely to intellection? Maimonides is certainly aware of this problem. He indicates that Adam lost his intellectual perfection by turning to matters of the corporeal world (Guide 1:2).36 He describes the perfect man as living in solitude so as to avoid disturbing influences (2:36; cf. 1:35). He terms the prophet's attainment of theoretical perfection as "ascent" and his leadership and education of others as "descent" (1:15). If political perfection is the ultimate one, why should it be viewed as a "descent"? If, on the other hand, the contemplative ideal is ultimate, why should the prophet descend at all, thereby disturbing his precious isolation, in order to assume an active role in society? This is the very problem which disturbed Plato in his Myth of the Cave and which he "solved" by subjugating the individual's own good to the good of society.37 The key to understanding Maimonides' basic solution to the problem lies in the notion of "overflow" or "emanation." Maimonides offers the most extensive discussion of this notion in Guide 2:11-12 in reference to the activity of God, the Separate Intellects, and the spheres. It is further to show that governance overflows from the deity, may He be exalted, to the intellects according to their rank; that from the benefits received by the intellects, good things and lights overflow to the bodies of the spheres; and that from the spheres-because of the greatness of the benefits they have received from their principles-forces and good things overflow to this body subject to generation and corruption .... In effect a thing that is perfect in some kind of perfection sometimes possesses this perfection within such limits of the incorporeal world is the intellect's final felicity. For the clearest expression of this view, see Maimonides' Introduction to Peteq H.eleq 205. 36. For a discussion of Maimonides' treatment of this story, see my "Practical Intellect in the Philosophy of Maimonides," pp. 196-198, and the bibliography cited there. 37. Republic VII.514a-521b.</page><page sequence="16">184 HOWARD KREISEL that it perfects the thing itself; perfection does not, however, pass over from it to something else. Sometimes its perfection is within such limits that a residue of perfection is left over from it for something else .... The case of being is simnilar. For the overflow coming from Him, may He be exalted, for the bringing into being of separate intellects, overflows likewise from these intellects, so that one of them brings another one into being and this continues up to the Active Intellect. (2:11.275) The notion of overflow, Maimonides continues in 2:12, primarily char- acterizes the activity of the incorporeal beings who do not act by physical contact, and whose activity is constant and received by all that are prepared to receive it. It is also used, however, to describe the forces flowing from the spheres to the sublunar world, though the spheres are bodies and distance is a factor in their activity upon the matter of the sublunar world. None of these entities experience any change of essence-their essence being intellect-or loss of perfection as a result of their activity vis-h-vis others. God never ceases to contemplate Himself as the Principle of all existence, and the order of existence emanates from Him. The Separate Intellects engage in uninterrupted intellection of God and themselves, and from this intellection emanates the chain of Separate Intellects and spheres. The spheres engage in uninterrupted intellection of the immaterial world, and their movement, together with the forces overflowing from their movement, is the consequence. There are a number of passages in the Guide which indicate that Mai- monides maintained this model also in understanding human perfection. The notion of overflow enters into the very definition he gives to prophecy, a phenomenon equated with human perfection or at least contingent upon it. Know that the true reality and quiddity of prophecy consist in its being an overflow overflowing from God ... through the intermediation of the Active Intellect, toward the rational faculty in the first place and thereafter toward the imaginative faculty. (2:36.369) Not only do God and the Active Intellect not experience any loss of perfection as a result cf the overflow, but neither does the rational faculty in its overflow to the imagination. Moreover, Maimonides distinguishes between two types of prophets (as well as philosophers), those who do not take an active public role and those who do.</page><page sequence="17">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 185 Sometimes the prophetic revelation that comes to the prophet only renders him perfect and has no other effect. And sometimes the prophetic revelation that comes to him compels him to address a call to the people, teach them, and let his own perfection overflow toward them. (2:37.375) Ultimate human perfection thus may be seen as "overflowing" perfec- tion-one in which the rational faculty maintains its own perfection while affecting that which is beneath it-whether it be the imagination and the rest of the soul in the case of private prophecy, or in addition, other individuals in the case of public prophecy. The political-pedagogical role of the prophet results from an internal compulsion experienced at the highest levels of prophecy to perfect others in accordance with the level of one's own perfection. This is analogous to the overflow from the higher entities. It is due to the strength of the overflow from the intellect that the prophets necessarily possess a strong faculty of courage which enables them, indeed compels them, to perform their task (2:38). Certainly no one who attains perfection "willingly" seeks to assume a leadership role. The desire to rule is a spurious desire for Maimonides. The perfect person desires solitude to the degree possible. He feels, however, that he has no choice but to govern, whatever his individual preferences may be.38 In this matter, it is not only the ability to govern which is natural-an ability belonging both to the intellectually perfect and non-perfect (2:40)-but also the internal need felt by some of the perfect to govern. Yet the perfection of the individual remains the perfection of the intellect, the overflow being the practical consequence of this perfection. IV What, however, does the notion of overflow mean in the context of human experience? When all is said and done, it would appear to remain the case that while one may live a life which finds an admirable "balance" between contemplation and practical activity, one form of activity still comes at the 38. This is how Moses' and Jeremiah's initial refusal to accept their prophetic missions should be understood in the context of Maimonides' philosophy. Their dialogue with God represents the tension they felt in their own souls. God's "command" is simply the internal compulsion experienced by them to undertake their mission. See Maimonides' approach to the divine command in 2:48.</page><page sequence="18">186 HOWARD KREISEL expense of the other. It is precisely this problem which Maimonides seeks to address towards the end of the Guide. In the parable of the palace, he maintains that the prophets are those who "direct all the acts of their intellect toward an examination of the beings with a view to drawing from them proof with regard to Him, so as to know His governance of them in whatever way it is possible" (3:51.620). While Maimonides hints at the political role of the prophets, the knowledge he stresses is that of God's governance-i.e., knowledge of the totality of existence. Maimonides remains aware that "total devotion to Him and the employment of intellectual thought in constantly loving Him . . . mostly this is achieved in solitude and isolation" (p. 621). Yet the subsequent discussion in the chapter is devoted to outlining a regimen, revolving around the performance of the commandments, gradually bringing about a separation of the intellect from the corporeal faculties, of contemplating God while simultaneously engaging in physical activity. And there may be a human individual who, through his apprehension of the true realities and his joy in what he has apprehended, achieves a state in which he talks with people and is occupied with his bodily necessities while his intellect is wholly turned toward Him, may He be exalted, so that in his heart he is always in His presence, may He be exalted, while outwardly he is with people. (p. 623) This is a perfection which Maimonides ascribes to Moses and the pa- triarchs. The perfection entails living simultaneously on two planes-as an intellect engaged in constant contemplation and as a corporeal entity engaged in corporeal acts. Maimonides continues by tying providential protection to this state of continuous contemplation. The inference is that the individual who attains the identity of an intellect separate from matter is no longer affected by corporeal afflictions-neither suffering nor death-though he may continue to exist for awhile also as a corporeal entity." It is for this reason that Maimonides ends the chapter with a description of the death of the perfect individual in the course of his contemplation-his examples being Moses, Aaron, and Miriam-which in fact is just the eternal continuation of existence as a separate intellect. 39. This interpretation was already advanced by a number of Maimonides' medieval and modern commentators. See my discussion in "'The Suffering of the Righteous' in Medieval Jewish Philosophy" [Heb.], Daar 19 (1987): 19-25.</page><page sequence="19">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES" GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 187 Maimonides does not enter into detail about how he conceives the relation between the intellect and the rest of the soul and the body in the state of ultimate perfection, but a hint of his view on this matter is presented in an earlier chapter. In Guide 1:72, Maimonides treats the world as a macroanthropos and man as a microcosmos. This comparison is based on the fact that man possesses a rational faculty which rules him, just as the world is ruled by a rational principle-God. It is man's reason, Maimonides stresses, which distinguishes him from all other sublunar creatures and allows for drawing an analogy between man and the world. Here too Maimonides' view suggests that by virtue of reason we are in some way like God, though Maimonides deals here primarily with practical reason. Maimonides then presents three points on which the analogy between man and the world breaks down. The third point is that the rational faculty subsists in the body and is inseparable from it. God, on the other hand, does not subsist in the body of the world and is completely separate from it. Maimonides continues, Know that it behooved us to compare the relation obtaining between God, may He be exalted, and the world to that obtaining beneath the acquired intellect (al-'aqi al-mustafcid) and man; this intellect is not a faculty in the body but is truly separate from the organic body and overflows toward it. (p. 193) The notion of the acquired intellect is found in the writings of the Islamic Aristotelians, and has its source in the Arabic translation of Alexander.40 According to Alfarabi in his Letter on the Intellect, the acquired intellect does not require the body for its function or subsistence, thereby indicating that it is an immortal entity. It is attained at the stage that the individual, having intellected the forms inhering in matter, turns inward and apprehends its intel- ligibles as separate from matter. With the attainment of the acquired intellect, the individual can apprehend the forms not inhering in matter-i.e., the Separate Intellects. The Active Intellect becomes the "form" of the acquired intellect-a clear allusion to conjunction. Alfarabi maintains, however, that the acquired intellect is below the level of the Active Intellect.4' In his earlier work, The Political Regime, Alfarabi enters into fewer details regarding the 40.

The implication of his brief statement ori the matter is that the individual may continue to exist as a corporeal entity even with the attainment of the acquired intellect, a view maintained also in his Islamic philosophic sources. The overflow from the acquired intellect sustains and guides the rest of the soul and body, while it is no longer dependent on the soul and body. Though Maimonides hardly mentions the acquired intellect in any of his writings, it appears to form the basis of his views relating to immortality and prophecy in a number of his legal writings, most notably Mishneh Torah: The Laws of the Principles of the Torah. His view that the form of man referred to in the verse, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness" (Gen. 1:26), is the "form which knows and apprehends the intellects which have no body--e.g., the angels (= Separate Intellects)-until he is similar (yidmneh) to them" (4:8) is a clear allusion to the acquired intellect. His subsequent remarks in the next halakhah only serve to confirm this identification. Maimonides maintains that this form is not a faculty of the soul which is dependent upon the body and destroyed with the disintegration of the body. Rather, it pp. 20-31.

His view of prophecy also alludes to the attainment of the acquired intellect and conjunction with the Active Intellect. Maimonides describes prophecy as a state in which the holy spirit descends upon the prophet-after his attaining knowledge of all existence, particularly the "holy, pure forms" (= Separate Intellects)-at which time "his soul conjoins (tit'arev)44 with the degree of angels called 'ishini (= Active Intellect),45 and he is transformed into a different individual.46 He understands with his intellect which is no longer like it was previously" (7:1).47 Maimonides' views in a number of passages in the Guide, most notably 3:51, may also be best understood in light of the doctrine of the acquired intellect. In his description of the level attained by Moses and the patri- archs-one in which they acted solely with their limbs while their intellects were constantly focused on God-Maimonides also mentions "the union (ittihad) of their intellects through apprehension (idrak) of Him" (p. 623). This is an apparent reference to the state of conjunction coming with the apprehension of the Separate Intellect. Maimonides' view of their "permanent state of extreme perfection" (p. 624) adds support to this interpretation.48 A description of the state Maimonides may have had in mind can also be found in Judah Halevi's Kuzari, a work Maimonides appears to be acquainted 44. Maimonides does not use the Hebrew term devekutr ("cleavage") which in the later translations of his and other Arabic works, as well as in Hebrew philosophical and mystical treatises, signifies "conjunction." This usage already occurs in works prior to Maimonides, such as in the Bible commentary of Abraham Ibn Ezra (e.g., Num. 20:8). Maimonides follows the Sifre, 'Ekev 49 in interpreting the commandment to "cleave" to God (Deut. 10:20) as meaning to associate with the sages. See Laws of Character Traits 6:2. 45. See Laws of the Principles of the Torah 2:7. 46. See 1 Sam. 10:6. 47. A similar description of prophecy can be found in his Introduction to Pereq Heleq 212 (sixth principle): "Their souls are prepared to receive the 'form' of the intellect [= the acquired intellect]. The human intellect conjoins (yattasilu) with the Active Intellect and there overflows to them a noble overflow. These are the prophets." Cf. Political Regime 32. 48. The meaning of "union" (ittihdd) and "conjunction" (ittisdl) in Maimonides is ambigu- ous. See Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect," pp. 80-84. There is general agreement that Maimonides did not accept the possibility of a complete union with the Active Intellect. Yet Altmann's limiting of Maimonides' use of "conjunction" to the reception of intelligibles in general is open to question. For a further discussion of this point, see below.</page><page sequence="22">190 HOWARD KREISEL with.49 In the speech of the "philosopher" at the beginning of the work, Halevi offers the following description of human perfection, There conjoins with the perfect individual a light of a divine kind, called Active Intellect. His passive intellect conjoins with it to form a complete unity [lit.: a conjunction of unity-ittisdl ittihdd], so that the individual sees that he is the Active Intellect, there is no difference between them. The organs-i.e., the limbs-of that individual reach the point where they perform only the perfect activities at the most appropriate times and in the most excellent manner. It is as if they were organs of the Active Intellect, not of the passive hylic intellect which employed them beforehand.... And this degree is the final one to which the perfect individual may aspire to reach. ... The soul of the perfect individual becomes one with that Intellect, and he is not concerned about the decay of the body and its organs.50 Imitatio Dei thus takes on two aspects which on the ultimate level overcome the tension between them and complement each other. When Maimonides speaks of "assimilation" to God as an end, he refers to the realm of action or character traits. This is the perfection that one attains as a corporeal creature ruling oneself and others in the best possible manner. A similar usage occurs also in Alfarabi's writings.5' Maimonides refrains from employing the phrase "assimilation to God" when positing the perfection of the intellect as the final end-though he does mention assimilation to the Separate Intellects-perhaps in order to preserve the unbridgeable chasm separating the divine essence and the human essence. Nevertheless he cannot escape seeing some point of similarity between the two, for it is by virtue of intellect that man is said to be created in God's "likeness." This aspect 49.

The translation is my own, based on David Baneth's Arabic edition (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1977), pp. 4-5, and utilizing the Hebrew translations of Ibn Tibbon and Even Shmuel, together with Hartwig Hirschfeld's English translation. See also Kuzari 4:19, where Halevi describes the philosophers' view of the dual nature of perfection, consisting both of a theoretical and a practical aspect. There the immortality of the acquired intellect is mentioned explicitly. 51. See Berman, "Political Interpretation of the Maxim," p. 56. Cf. Halevi's description of the philosopher's view in Kuzari 4:19.170. Halevi also confines "assimilation to the Creator" to the practice and legislation of what is good, thereby imitating God's good organization of all things. In the same section Halevi, in the name of the philosophers, posits theoretical perfection as the end of man.</page><page sequence="23">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 191 of perfection, the one that deals directly with the essence of the individual and involves his immortality, comes with the apprehension of the immaterial world and conjunction with the Active Intellect. The perfect individual lives according to both perfections simultaneously. His "separate" intellect continuously contemplates the totality of existence. At the same time the emanation from it to his rational faculty rules his soul in the best possible manner. The soul in turn practices the most perfect actions of which it is capable, whether in the area of ethics (self-government) or politics (the government of others). While political leadership is for Maimonides the highest level of practical perfection,"2 the individual's imitation of the divine attributes, as outlined at the conclusion of the Guide, need not take only that form. The perfect individual will behave in the most noble manner in all of his dealings vis-a-vis himself and others. His behavior will no longer stem from certain affections of the soul (mercy, anger, etc.) which are in themselves corporeal attributes. Instead they will follow from purely rational considerations rooted in, or "flowing" from, his theoretical knowledge." To what degree he will feel compelled to guide others to perfection, and his capacity for doing so, will depend on the level of perfection of his intellection 52. The highest level assuming the form of legislating for a polity, a level which Maimonides, as opposed to Alfarabi, limits to a single individual. The prophets and sages, however, also practice forms of political leadership, playing the role Alfarabi assigns to the princes of the law. See my "Practical Intellect," pp. 205-206. In a crucial sense, Maimonides, both in his capacity as leader of the Egyptian Jewish community and, more importantly, as legal authority and codifier of Jewish law, continues the same political role he ascribes to the prophets and sages of old. 53. That Maimonides in the Guide sees ultimate ethical perfection as the obliteration of all psychological traits has been convincingly argued by Herbert Davidson, "The Middle Way in Maimonides' Ethics," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 54 (1987): 31-72. Davidson sees a development in Mairnonides' thought on this matter. In my opinion, Maimonides at least comes close to presenting this ideal, albeit in a veiled manner, in his legal writings. The difference between this practical form of imitatio Dei and that which Maimonides presents in his legal writings is, however, significant. In his legal writings the commandment to imitate God is described with no explicit reference to theoretical perfection. Only one's conformity to a certain type of activity and the training of one's soul to attain certain character traits ensuring this activity are demanded. This ethical approach to imitatio Dei is appropriate for works aimed at the entire Jewish people. It is the highest level of perfection possible for the masses, though few may in fact attain it. The end of the Guide, on the other hand, describes the form of inmitatio Dei characterizing the perfect. This is practical activity which follows from theoretical perfection inasmuch as it is determined purely by reason rather than any character traits of the soul.</page><page sequence="24">192 HOWARD KREISEL and corporeal faculties, as well as the social situation in which he finds himself. V The concepts of emanation, acquired intellect, and conjunction provide the key to harmonizing the two types of perfection presented by Maimonides. Certain aspects of Maimonides' discussion, however, raise the question whether he accepted the position here outlined. Maimonides was aware of Alfarabi's retraction of his position on the possibility of conjunction with the Active Intellect and achieving immortality, a fact which at the least must have led him to doubt the basis for accepting Alfarabi's earlier views. Maimonides' view on the limits of knowledge--even in areas such as physics and astronomy, let alone metaphysics-suggests that he may have in fact accepted Alfarabi's later view. His position on the immortality of the intellect thus may be interpreted as belonging to his "exoteric" doctrines.54 In Guide 2:36, Maimonides does not introduce the notion of acquired intellect nor that of conjunction in his description of prophecy-a position reflecting a break not only with Alfarabi's earlier treatments of the subject,5 but with Maimonides' own description of prophecy in Laws of the Principles of the Torah 7:1. It is also interesting to note that Maimonides nowhere explicitly ascribes the attainment of the acquired intellect to any historical personage, including Moses, who is the ultimate paradigm of human perfec- tion. His equivocation in his various writings on the issue whether Moses' intellect remained tied to the body56 appears to indicate that Maimonides at least questioned whether Moses in fact did. Maimonides' position that 54. This argument is presented by Pines, "Limitations of Human Knowledge," pp. 82-109. 55. See above, n. 42. 56. In his Introduction to Pereq Hieleq 212-213 (seventh principle), Maimonides indicates that Moses apprehended the level of the angels (= Separate Intellects) and became angelic, with no "veil" remaining which he did not rend, a clear reference to attaining the acquired intellect and achieving conjunction with the Active Intellect. In Eight Chapters 7, on the other hand, Maimonides indicates that there was one veil which he did not rend-the intellect tied to matter and is not "separate." The differences between the two passages may be traced to their purpose. The former source stresses the uniqueness of Moses' level which qualifies him for receiving the one divine law, while the latter source dwells on the utmost limit of human perfection as embodied by Moses. Yet this does not preclude the view that Maimonides did not reach a final conclusion on the issue of the limits of perfection. A similar equivocation occurs in Laws of the Principles of the Torah. In 1:10, Maimonides indicates that Moses' intellect remained tied</page><page sequence="25">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 193 practical affairs interfered with Moses' prophecy, as in the incident of the spies (Guide 2:36), serves to reinforce this interpretation. How much more so is the failure to attain the acquired intellect and achieve conjunction with the Active Intellect true of the other prophets, in whose case the imagination-a corporeal faculty of the soul-was integral to their prophecy. Maimonides' failure in the Guide to discuss the issue of the intellect, indicating that the philosophers have already treated this subject, can only be regarded as disingenuous in light of the many differences of opinion which exist among the philosophers themselves, a point which would certainly not be lost on Maimonides' philosophically versed readers. Maimonides appears to be hiding something. His rejection of human immortality, an achievement which he apparently concedes is only possible with the apprehension of the separate essences and attainment of the acquired intellect, may be his esoteric doctrine. Yet Maimonides' views hardly need be interpreted in this manner.57 In the final analysis, human immortality and the limits of perfection of the intellect belong to the domain of philosophical issues which are not known demonstratively. As Maimonides himself cautions, one cannot hold conclusions in nondemonstrative matters with complete certainty. One must nevertheless favor those views bolstered by the strongest arguments and suffering the least significant doubts (Guide 2:22). Maimonides does not appear to have undergone any change of mind in regard to the immortality of the perfect intellect, as well as its being an entity distinct from the rational soul, a view found already in his legal writings which he reiterates in a number of passages in the Guide.58 In the Guide he appears to show greater awareness, however, of some of the problems involved, particularly in light of the limits of human knowledge. The critical question is what level of knowledge suffices for a person to attain the "acquired intellect" and achieve immortality, a problem which troubled philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition not only to the body, while in 7:6 he maintains that Moses' intellect was permanently tied to God and he became sanctified like the angels. 57. It is significant that even the philosophers who were aware of Alfarabi's retraction (e.g., Ibn Bajja and Ibn Tufayl) continue to accept the possibility of conjunction and immortality. 58. See Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect," pp. 85-91.

The tie between the attainment of the acquired intellect, the apprehension of, and conjunction with, the Active Intellect, and immortality lies at the foundation of the approach of Alexander, Alfarabi (his early writings), and Ibn Bajja. For all the important differences between them, they share the view that only by apprehending existents separate from matter does one become an existent separate from matter, conjoining with the object of apprehension (Active Intellect) and remaining in that state permanently (matter being the cause of corruption). This follows from the well-known principle extrapolated from the writings of Aristotle on the identity between intellect, the intellectually cognizing subject, and the intellectually cognizing object.60 Not all philosophers adopted this view of the intellect. Avicenna, for example, considered the rational soul generated but immortal, though the degree of one's eternal felicity depended upon the level of intellection.61 Maimonides, in consistently alluding to the view that the nonperfect rational soul is corruptible,62 is unambiguous in his rejection of Avicenna's view in this matter. The limits Maimonides places on man's knowledge on one hand, with his acceptance of immortality on the other, suggest that he may have had a different view of the level of knowledge necessary for immortality than those envisioned by his predecessors. The conclusion I would argue, however, is that he too continued to posit, though in a somewhat tentative manner, the apprehension of the Active Intellect as a necessary condition for immortality.63 The possibility of apprehending the Active Intellect, as well as the tie between this apprehension and immortality, is quite explicit in Laws of the Principles of the Torah 4:8.6, Nor does Maimonides abandon this position 59. See, for example, Gersonides' discussion in his Wars of the Lord 1:8-13, trans. into English by Seymour Feldman (Philadelphia: Jewish Public Society, 1984), vol. 1, pp. 170-225. 60.

See, however, Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect," pp. 85-91. 64. Altmann maintains that Lawos of Repentance 8:3 suggests a different conclusion, inasmuch as the apprehension of the Separate Intellects is treated as one of a wider range of topics-God and the other existents-known to the immortal intellect (ibid., p. 86). The main point, however, is that Maimonides explicitly mentions this topic. Moreover, in contradistinction to the mention of the intellect's apprehension of God, the apprehension of the Separate Intellects is not qualified by him with the phrase "according to its [the intellect's] ability." In the parallel</page><page sequence="27">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 195 in the Guide. While Maimonides mentions the difficulty in apprehending the Active Intellect in 1:43 and 1:49, his discussion in both chapters suggests it is this apprehension which is attained by the perfect after they have completed their training. In 1:62 Maimonides indicates, "It has been made clear in the books that have been composed concerning divine science that it is impossible to forget this science; I mean thereby the apprehension (idrak) of the Active Intellect" (p. 152). Maimonides statement is a clear echo of Ibn Bajja's position concerning the acquired intellect.65 The conclusion of 2:12 also contains a reference to the apprehension of the Active Intellect. Nor does Maimonides' position that "matter is a strong veil preventing the apprehension (idrak) of that which is separate from matter as it truly is" (3:9.436) necessarily negate this view, despite the fact that he deals in this passage with the aspiration to apprehend God and the Separate Intellects. The attainment of the acquired intellect reflects the stage that the intellect frees itself from matter in a significant sense. Maimonides certainly shows his awareness of the fact that not everyone accepted the possibility of the apprehension of the Separate Intellects. His interpretation in 1:37 of Onkelos' view that God's "face," which was hidden even from Moses, refers to the Separate Intellects, may well be an allusion to Alfarabi's later view. It is significant, however, that this is not Maimonides' own interpretation. In 1:54, Maimonides interprets the "face" as referring to the divine essence, while the "back," which was apprehended by Moses, passage in Introduction to Pereq HIeleq 204-205, Maimonides mentions only apprehension of God, but adds, "There [the World to Come] our souls apprehend knowledge of God, similar to the apprehension of the spheres or greater. . . . The existence of the soul is in the existence of its intelligible and they are one as maintained by the most expert philosophers.... These souls take pleasure in what they apprehend of the existence of the Creator just as the Holy Beasts and other levels of angels [= Separate Intellects] take pleasure in what they apprehend of His existence.... The existence of the soul, as we have explained, is eternal, just as the existence of the Creator Who is the cause of its existence, inasmuch as it apprehended Him." Maimonides clearly intimates that the apprehension of the immortal intellect is similar (though not necessarily identical) to that of the Separate Intellects. His mention of the "expert philosophers" in this context certainly includes Alfarabi and Ibn Bajja. Maimonides also mentions the apprehension of the Separate Intellects in his Conmnentar, on 'Avot, 3:20. Yet there he indicates that this apprehension does not result in one's becoming a Separate Intellect. 65. See Narboni's commentary to Guide 1:62, ed. J. Goldenthal (Vienna, 1852), p. 11a. Several chapters later (1:74.221), Maimonides also adopts Ibn Bajja's position on the unity of the immortal intellects (cf. 1:70.174), though this may not have been Maimonides' final thought on the matter. See the end of 3:51, where he alludes to different levels of immortal intellects.</page><page sequence="28">196 HOWARD KREISEL refers to all the existents, presumably including the Separate Intellects (cf. 1:38). In the Guide, Maimonides at times also alludes to conjunction with the Active Intellect-a notion which emerges quite explicitly in his legal writings66--though he certainly does not have in mind complete union and identity with it. In several passages, he incorporates the very terms used for conjunction (ittisal, ittihlad). It is true that the term ittisal has several meanings in Islamic philosophy, inasmuch as the notion plays different roles in different epistemologies. In addition to some form of union with the Active Intellect resulting from the apprehension of this Separate Intellect, ittisal may refer to the apprehension of any intelligible-a usage found by Avicenna, for whom every intelligible is received by direct "contact" with the Active Intellect.67 In some of the passages in which Maimonides employs the term, he may have had this meaning in mind, though this is not conclusive.68 Avicenna also describes a form of "conjunction" characterizing the prophetic intellect in which all intelligibles are received nearly at once from the Active Intellect due to the strength of the prophet's intellectual "intuition." 69 Certain views Maimonides voices about prophecy clearly reflect Avicenna's influence in this matter. Maimonides' use of ittisal in his discussion of prophetic visions at the end of 2:45 hardly refers to the regular process of discursive reasoning, as Maimonides' remarks make clear, but to the special intuition discussed by Avicenna and which is confined to the prophetic intellect.70 Maimonides' view on the "union" (ittihad) of the patriarchs' intellects with God also suggests conjunction with 66. See above, n. 47. 67. See Avicenna's De Anima 247. See also Davidson, "Alfarabi and Avicenna," pp. 166-169; and A. M. Goichon, Lexique de la Langue Philosophique d'Ibn Sina (Paris: Descle de Brouwer, 1938). 68. See Guide 1:1, 1:18. The former passage is certainly ambiguous on this point. In the latter passage, Maimonides may subtly be referring to prophetic apprehension, rather than normal discursive reasoning, inasmuch as the discussion deals with apprehending God. It should be added that Maimonides holds the view that intelligibles are attained through a process of "abstraction" (1:73.209). This suggests that the role of the Active Intellect is to enable the human intellect to act, rather than to bestow directly the individual intelligibles as Avicenna maintains. 69. Avicenna's De Aninma 248. See also F Rahman, trans., Avicenna 's Psychology (Oxford, 1952), p. 36. 70. Maimonides' reference there to 2:38, a chapter in which the impress of Avicenna's views concerning prophetic intuition clearly emerges, serves to strengthen this interpretation.</page><page sequence="29">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 197 the Active Intellect after apprehending the metaphysical world, rather than the apprehension of intelligibles in general. His description of passionate love (hesheq) at the end of the chapter-a description reminiscent of philosophic- mystical accounts of ecstasy in the Neoplatonic tradition-also appears to refer to conjunction, but at the termination of one's corporeal existence with the final separation of the intellect from the body. Maimonides' use of ittisal in 3:8 in reference to the perfect should be interpreted in a similar vein. [They] seek a state of perpetual permanence according to what is required by their noble form. They only reflect on the mental representation of an intelligible, on the grasp of true opinion regarding everything, and on union (ittisal) with the divine intellect, which lets overflow toward them that through which that form exists. (p. 432) "Conjunction" here does not refer back to the "mental representation of an intelligible." Rather, it refers to the end of the process of attaining all the intelligibles, "that through which that form exists" being a reference to the overflow of the acquired intellect. Another source which appears to have left a sharp imprint upon some of Maimonides' views of apprehension of, and conjunction with, the Active Intellect is Avicenna's treatment of perfection towards the end of his The- orems and Axioms. Avicenna does not employ there any of the terms for "conjunction," but he likens the intellectual illumination of the divine world, and the resulting ecstasy experienced by the "knower," to lightning flashes. Even at this level, progress can be made in the frequency of the flashes and illumination which results. At the end of the process, illumination is experienced as a constant flame, when the knower finds all knowledge within himself, and achieves some form of identity with the Truth.71 Avicenna's view suggests a notion of conjunction which builds upon, but goes beyond, the description of the prophetic intellect in his De Anima. Ibn Tufayl, in his summary of this passage in Hayy ben Yaqdhan, understands the final stage as one of conjunction.72 In all probability it is this passage which Maimonides had in mind in framing his parable of the lightning flashes in the introduction 71. Kitab al-Ishiarat w-al-Tanbhat, ed. J. Forget (Leiden: Brill, 1892), pp. 202-204. 72. Leon Gauthier, ed. (Beirut, 1936), p. 7. Ibn Tufayl employs the term wusiil. An English translation of this passage by George Atiyeh is found in Medieval Political Philosophy, p.</page><page sequence="30">198 HOWARD KREISEL to the Guide, though Maimonides, like Avicenna, does not there mention "conjunction" explicitly.73 Maimonides' views on the limits of reason, even in regard to corporeal matters, as well as his views that even Moses' intellect remained tied to matter and that the prophets required the use of their imaginative faculty, do not hint at any esoteric doctrines on this issue. Intellectual perfection for Maimonides is intrinsically tied to the apprehension of essences, leaving open the possibility that man may apprehend the essence of corporeal entities, such as the spheres, without necessarily apprehending all their accidents. His view on the tie of Moses' intellect to matter does entail a certain ambiguity in regard to the perfect intellect, but this ambiguity is found already in Alfarabi's description of the acquired intellect. In his Letter on the Intellect, Alfarabi treats the acquired intellect as a self-subsisting, immortal substance, which is not in matter, and is of the same species as the Active Intellect. Yet at the same time he maintains that the acquired intellect is below the realm of the immaterial existents and related to matter, comparing it to the intellect of the heavenly bodies.74 In other words, it is an intellect which is separate from matter, but not completely separate. Even in Alfarabi's earlier writings, where he explicitly mentions conjunction between the acquired intellect and the Active Intellect, and that no intermediary exists between them, he does not appear to posit a complete identity between them." Thus Alfarabi does not appear to have ever conceived of the possibility of completely apprehending the Active Intellect. Maimonides remains essentially loyal to Alfarabi's earlier views in their very ambiguity. He does not, however, introduce Alfarabi's view of the stage in which the intellect apprehends itself. He also goes beyond Alfarabi's view, approaching that of Ibn Bajja, in his description of the acquired intellect in 1:72. When we combine all of Maimonides' views on perfection, the picture 137. It should be noted that in an earlier passage on p. 129, Ibn Sina speaks of a "type of conjunction" (ittisal iid) in the attainment of any intelligible from the Active Intellect. 73. See, however, Pines, "Philosophic Sources," p. cv, who treats Ibn Bajja as Maimonides' more probable source. 74. Risalat fi'l 'Aql 20-31; translated by Hyman in Philosophy in the Middle Ages, pp. 217-220. 75. See, for example, Walzer, Alfarabi on the Peifect State, pp. 242-245. The precise relation between the acquired intellect and conjunction in Alfarabi's thought has been subject to conflicting interpretations. See Altmann, "Maimonides on the Intellect," p. 78 n. 141.</page><page sequence="31">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 199 which emerges is not without its problems. Maimonides' treatment of per- fection in the Laws of the Principles of the Torah shows that he regards perfection as involving apprehension of the metaphysical realm, conjunction with the Active Intellect, and a permanent transformation of the intellect in its attainment of an immortal form (4:8-9, 7:1). At the same time, he treats the resulting "illumination" in terms of transitory experiences which are not purely intellectual in nature (7:2-4). In the Guide, Maimonides does not abandon his previous positions, though he appears to hold some of them in a more tentative manner, also placing greater emphasis on the limits of human knowledge. He continues to allude to the view that it is with the apprehension of the separate existents that the acquired intellect and immortality are attained. His remark that one who apprehends the Active Intellect never forgets this knowledge shows the permanence of the transformation. At the same time he views the actual experience of prophecy, a phenomenon he equates with human perfection, as a transitory one consisting of intellectual illumination (1:introduction). He also stresses that the imagination, and not just the intellect, is integrally involved in the prophetic experience (2:36). The fact that there is a certain lack of clarity in the picture which Maimonides draws is hardly surprising. The topic of human perfection involves a host of issues (e.g., the rational soul, prophecy, the Law) with which Maimonides deals in different contexts, drawing upon different views in the course of his discussion. In a crucial sense this is not unlike the case of some of Maimonides' philosophic predecessors, most notably Alfarabi and Avicenna. At times Maimonides' discussions have different purposes which influence the views he stresses in his presentation-a point which certainly emerges from his various discussions of prophecy where he alternates between stressing the role of the imagination and stressing the role of the intellect. It is the different contexts and purposes of his discussions which also lead Maimonides at times to describe Moses alone in terms suggesting conjunction, while at other times he also depicts other individuals in such terms, and still other times his views suggest that conjunction is not possible for anyone. In dealing with the issue of perfection from different perspectives, Maimonides on occasion presents views whose relation is not readily discernible, even in the course of the same discussion. Some of his views in 3:51, for example, suggest that conjunction is possible during the course of one's life, while the</page><page sequence="32">200 HOWARD KREISEL end of the chapter suggests that it is possible only at the moment of "death," i.e., the final separation from the body.76 Maimonides' failure to harmonize between all his views thus does not necessarily mean that the inconsistencies always allude to an esoteric doctrine, though this often is undoubtedly the case. The esoteric-exoteric distinction, however, is far from an adequate key to solve all the problems involved. At times the apparent inconsistencies result from Maimonides' emphasis of different aspects of his overall view, while at other times they may well be a result of an equivocation in Maimonides' own thought. In a crucial sense, the Guide, like all great philosophic works (though Maimonides did not regard his work as such according to his definition of "philosophy"), should be regarded as a work "in progress." That equiv- ocation and inadvertent inconsistencies characterize some of Maimonides' views hardly detract from the depth of his thought and the grandeur of his achievement, any more than they detract from the achievement of his great philosophical predecessors of whom this point is equally true. Maimonides creates the conceptual framework for understanding Judaism in light of an Aristotelian world-view. Within this framework he approaches the problem of human perfection. His work reflects a profound synthesis between views involving a myriad of topics. Yet given the nature of the work, it does not even attempt to pull together all the elements of this synthesis in a complete manner. There are indications that Maimonides conceived of perfection in terms of "degrees"--one can attain a "quasi" separate existence in this life in the form of the acquired intellect, and "quasi" conjunction with the Active Intellect as a result of "quasi" apprehension-the level of conjunction being greater or lesser depending upon the level of intellectual perfection in theoretical matters. Even for the perfect, progress is possible. The individual can approach greater unity with the Active Intellect, though never complete oneness. He may gradually free his intellect from corporeality while maintaining a corporeal existence, though during his corporeal lifetime he cannot do so completely. Hence illumination comes in flashes, and even for Moses corporeal matters 76. The problem whether conjunction occurred only at the moment of death or was possible while one remained tied to the body was one which occupied thinkers prior to Maimonides. See Shlomo Pines, "Shi'ite Terms and Conceptions in Judah Halevi's Kuzari," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 2 (1980): 211 f.; and Ezra Fleischer, The Proverbs of Sa'id ben Bdbshdd [Heb.] (Jerusalem: Ben-Zevi Institute, 1990), p. 144.</page><page sequence="33">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 201 continued to interfere with the level of intellection. Only with the acquired intellect's final separation from the body do its apprehension and conjunction remain unimpeded and constant, no longer hindered by the body in any way. Maimonides only alludes to these notions revolving around the idea of levels of intellectual perfection and does not attempt to work them out in detail. He may in fact have felt that he lacked the tools to do so. Maimonides' metaphysical views provide at least partial support for such an approach. He distinguishes between the perfection of the intellection even of the Separate Intellects, despite the fact that each apprehends the incorporeal world and in itself is incorporeal.77 The notion of overflowing perfection of the intellect provides a model of perfection which can never be attained in full, but can be approached. Action and contemplation will inevitably conflict, but the level of conflict can be minimized. Certainly the person who attains intellectual perfection and strives to maintain it will almost instinctively avoid all wrongdoing, for he will have freed himself from the pursuit of imaginary goods and the subjugation to his corporeal desires which is the root of evil actions. His corporeal actions inevitably will be the most noble ones. Yet his existence as a "separate" intellect will never be complete until the acquired intellect's final separation from the body and the latter's corruption. VI The notion of imitatio Dei also appears in a number of other contexts in the Guide which do not deal exclusively with man. Maimonides explains the term "back" as having, among its meanings, "following and imitating the conduct of some individual with respect to the conduct of life" (Guide 1:38.87).78 He continues by interpreting the verse "And thou shalt see My back" (Exod. 33:23): "Thou shall apprehend what follows Me, has come to be like (tashabbaha) Me, and follows necessarily from My will-that is, all the things created by Me." The meaning of the phrase "has come to be like me," when used in reference to the existents in their entirety, receives further elucidation in a subsequent passage. In 1:69, Maimonides discusses 77. See Laws of the Principles of the Torah 2:6-8. 78. Cf 1:24, where Maimonides explains the term "going," as in the verse "to go in His ways" (Deut. 28:9), in a similar manner.</page><page sequence="34">202 HOWARD KREISEL the notion of God as the cause-efficient, formal, and final--of the world: "Consequently He, may He be exalted, is the ultimate end of everything; and the end of the universe (al-kal: all) is similarly a seeking to be like (al-tashabbuh) unto His perfection as far as in its capacity" (p. 170). In this passage Maimonides presents his fundamental view of imnitatio Dei. God is conceived as perfect existence. Each existent is characterized by its particular perfection or final end. Thus the attainment of its perfection is an attainment of a likeness to God, though there be nothing in common between their respective perfections.79 The idea of imitating God through the achievement of one's final perfec- tion also underlies a passage dealing with the motion of the spheres. Furthermore, it follows necessarily from this that the sphere has a desire for that which it represents to itself and which is the beloved object: namely, the deity, may His name be exalted. He says that it is in this manner that the deity causes the sphere to move, I mean to say through the fact that the sphere desires to come to be like (al-tashabbuhu) that which it apprehends, which is the notion represented-a notion that is most exceedingly simple, in which there is no change and no coming-about of a new state, and from which good always overflows. This is impossible for the sphere qua a body unless its activity be a circular motion and nothing else. For this is the final perfection of what is possible for a body to have as its perpetual activity. For it is the simplest of motions that a body may have; and no change occurs because of it in the essence of the body or in the overflow of good effects resulting necessarily from the motion of the body. (Guide 2:4.256) Though Maimonides brings this position in the name of Aristotle, he clearly identifies with it, as his subsequent remarks indicate.80 In certain fundamental respects, human perfection is closest to that of the spheres in Maimonides' world-view. Maimonides himself indicates that the relation between man's rational faculty and the rest of his soul and body is most similar to the relation between the intellect of the spheres and their body (1:72). Both are composite existents, whose perfection touches their intellectual and corporeal aspects-intellection of the incorporeal world simultaneous with the most 79. This idea is already found in Alfarabi. See Walzer, Alfarabi on the Perfect State, pp. 236-239. 80. See Guide 2:5, 7, 10-12.</page><page sequence="35">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 203 perfect physical activity of which they are capable. The perfection of the spheres, as Maimonides points out, is even superior to that of man in both aspects.8' Yet Maimonides also maintains that the intellect of the spheres, like the human rational faculty, adheres in matter. In order to draw a model of human perfection in which the intellect eventually frees itself from all matter, Maimonides ultimately rejects the state of the spheres as the model for human perfection.82 He posits instead the relation between God and the world (and between the Separate Intellects and the spheres) as the appropriate model, corresponding to the relation between the acquired intellect of man on one hand, and the rest of man's soul (including the rational faculty) and body on the other. Thus while imnitatio Dei characterizes the final perfection of every existent in Maimonides' view, he comes close to maintaining that the intellect of the perfect individual, similar to the Separate Intellects and in contradistinction' to every other entity including the spheres, bears a critical point of resemblance with God. VII By rooting his approach to imitatio Dei in his metaphysical views, specifically the view of emanation, Maimonides not only is able to reconcile the practical and theoretical aspects of human perfection, but also to develop a highly integrated philosophic conception of the world. Ethics and human perfection are inseparably bound to the activity of God and the structure of the world. Yet this interpretation raises the question of the philosophic relevance of Maimonides' approach to imitatio Dei for the modern reader. It would appear that Maimonides' approach can serve as a viable model only for those who accept his metaphysical views. The fundamental changes in the conception of the world since Maimonides' time thus undermine the model of human perfection developed by him. We may regard with favor a model of human perfection which combines both theoretical studies and ethical and 81. I have dealt with this issue in "The Place of Man in the Hierarchy of Existence in the Philosophy of Ibn Gabirol and Maimonides," in Moshe Hallamish, ed., 'Alei Shefer: Studies in the Literature of Jewish Thought (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1990): English and French sec., pp. 100-102. 82. In all probability, Maimonides' view of human immortality lies at the foundation of his position. See my "Place of Man," pp. 104-105.</page><page sequence="36">204 HOWARD KREISEL social activity, but Maimonides' philosophy can no longer provide us with a justification for adopting such a model. This argument does not entail, however, that Maimonides' approach is solely of historical value. Nor does it necessitate that we seek new paths of interpretation, more consonant with modern thinking, in order to "revitalize" his approach. Maimonides' approach remains a vital one, but more as a challenge to modern ethical philosophy than as a substitute for it. Maimonides' implicit claim, reflecting the classical Greek and Islamic philosophic traditions, is that the philosophic enterprise must be "holistic." "Practical" philosophy (i.e., ethics and politics) is inseparable from theoretical philosophy (i.e., physics and metaphysics). The topics of ethics, human perfection, the individual's place in the world, and the nature of God and the world order are necessarily intertwined. Maimonides' approach to imitatio Dei and human perfection, for all the problems it raises, is profound for the manner in which it integrates these topics. It forces us to rethink the question, recently raised in the philosophic literature, whether we can develop viable approaches to ethics and human perfection which are not part of a holistic world view.83 Must philosophic ethics swing between intuitive approaches, grounded solely in our "natural" sense of right and wrong, and relativistic approaches, which deny any absolutes while often attempting to avoid the unfortunate consequences of the logic of this view? The classical Greek and medieval philosophic traditions offer a compelling alternative. While they tend to incorporate an "intuitive" approach to ethics, they anchor it in a vast conceptual structure that at the same time addresses the central questions of human existence and its relation to God and the world order. The hold Maimonides' philosophy continues to exert on modern students of philosophy stems in no small part from the longing shared by many for such a holistic approach to philosophy.84 We can no longer return to the world views of Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus (or Maimonides) while remaining intellectually honest, for science has under- mined much of the foundation upon which these views are based.

Spinoza offers yet another appealing model, grounded in a far different metaphysical system, which nonetheless shares with the classical and medieval philosophic traditions the notion that ethics and metaphysics are inseparably intertwined.</page><page sequence="37">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 205 complete conceptual model for understanding reality. We can continue to study the philosophers for the significant questions they ask (the "perennial" questions of philosophy), and for our effort to understand the history of human thought, an enterprise of immense intellectual and spiritual value in its own right. We can reinterpret their views in light of the changes in our understanding of reality, as has often been done, though in doing this we tend to recast the thinkers of old in our own image. We can also, however, wrestle with the philosophies of old in order to think anew our own positions. We can let the great voices of the past help us gain a better perspective for evaluating (or framing) our own approaches. Maimonides offers us a majestic model for approaching the problem of human perfection, just as he provides us with a majestic model for confronting the age-old conflict between religion and philosophy. We may well wonder why so much of Jewish thought (one is tempted to add, even non-Jewish thought) in the field of ethics since then appears to many to be so insignificant by comparison. Is it due solely to the transcendent quality of Maimonides' genius, or also to our sense of dissatisfaction about how foundationless modern approaches to ethics appear to be? We are thus left with the choice of continuing to approach ethics with certain implicit or explicit metaphysical assumptions, but independent of a metaphysical system, or accepting the challenge to develop new systems-holistic philosophies--on which to anchor our approaches to ethics. While we have become justifiably skeptical about the latter course, many will continue to find their inspiration in Maimonides' thought precisely because of the intellectual (and spiritual) appeal such a course holds. Appendix Imitatio Dei and Holiness Maimonides deals with the notion of holiness in several passages in his writings, each time in a succinct manner.85 On a number of occasions he treats holiness as integrally related to, if not synonymous with, observance 85. Hannah Kasher deals in detail with the topic of inmitatio Dei and holiness in her forthcoming book. For a study of this topic in Jewish thought in general, see Warren Harvey, "Holiness: A Command to Inlitatio Dei, " Tradition 16 (1976-77): 7-28.</page><page sequence="38">206 HOWARD KREISEL of the commandments, citing the rabbinic dictum that one sanctifies oneself by means of the commandments.86 Yet this usage in itself hardly explains the precise meaning of holiness in reference to man, let alone its meaning in reference to God or to other areas in which this notion is used, such as the Sanctuary and the Sabbath. In general, Maimonides ties the notion of imitatio Dei to the notion of holiness only in passing, despite the fact that the Torah draws this connection in a prominent manner (Lev. 11:44, 19:2). Nonetheless, a fairly complete picture of holiness and imnitatio Dei emerges from Maimonides' scattered remarks. In the abbreviated citation of Sifre, 'Ekev 49 ("He is called gracious so you shall be gracious. . .") in Book of the Commandments: positive commandment no. 8, there is no mention of holiness. In Laws of Character Traits 1:6, on the other hand, Maimonides adds, "He is called holy, so you shall be holy," without mentioning his source explicitly.87 This citation suggests that Maimonides regards holiness as a character trait. The problem is that he does not say anything more there about the subject, leaving open the question of what type of trait is holiness. Inasmuch as his discussion is marked by a general ambiguity as to the connection between God and the attributes which we are commanded to attain, we are also left wondering what holiness may mean in reference to God.88 The connection between holiness and character traits is further elaborated 86. Maimonides ascribes this dictum to the Sifra, Lev. 11:44 and 19:2 (Guide 3:33, 3:47), yet it does not appear in our editions of the work. In Book of the Commandments, root 4, Maimonides ascribes this dictum to the Sifre, and it does in fact appear in Sifre, Shelah 115. 87. This phrase does not appear in the passage in question in our versions of the Sifre. However, a similar passage, which includes the imitation of God's holiness (citing Lev. 11:44), appears in the eleventh-century midrashic compilation Lekah Tov to Deut. 13:5. This suggests that Maimonides' addition of "holiness" is derived from a rabbinic source. See M. M. Kasher, Torah Shelemah, vol. 28 (Jerusalem: American Biblical Encyclopedia Society, 1978), p. 238 n. 281. 88. The notion of holiness occurs already in the previous section, Laws of Principles of the Torah, in a number of places: 4:12 in reference to the celestial spheres; chap. 5 in reference to the commandment "to sanctify the Name"; chap. 6 in reference to the commandment not to efface the holy names of God; 7:1 in reference to the angels (= Separate Intellects); 7:7 in reference to the ways of prophecy (together with perishut, "separation"). By linking holiness with the ways of prophecy, Maimonides clearly alludes to certain characteristics, though he unfortunately does not elaborate. The command "to sanctify the Name," which Maimonides drew from his rabbinic sources, refers to the realm of human activity. A full discussion of the relation between holiness and this activity requires, however, a separate study. Maimonides gives no indication of the meaning of holiness in reference to the celestial spheres or Separate</page><page sequence="39">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 207 upon in the continuation of the Laws of Character Traits. In discussing the traits of the sage in 5:4, Maimonides maintains that he should "conduct himself in a holy manner and should not be found by his wife [for purposes of sexual intercourse] like a rooster, but only from Sabbath night to Sabbath night, and providing he has strength." Holiness in this context is explicitly connected to sexual restraint, a connection which Maimonides accentuates in subsequent discussions. Maimonides goes on in 5:5 to link the notions of holiness, purity, and the improvement of one's character traits. That holiness in reference to man is connected with character traits in Maimonides' thought is further confirmed by other passages in the Mishneh Torah. In the conclusion to Laws of Impure Foods (16:12), Maimonides writes, Separation [from contact with other people and eating and drinking with them] brings about the purity of the body from evil acts. The purity of the body brings about the holiness of the soul from evil traits (de'ot ra'ot). The holiness of the soul causes assimilation (le-hiddamot) to the Indwelling, as it is written: You shall sanctify yourself and you shall be holy for I am holy (Lev. 11:44).89 Holiness in this context does not refer to a particular trait, but to the totality of noble traits. It is significant that Maimonides does not view holiness as distinct from the realm of ethics. That de'ot refers here to traits and not intelligibles can be shown on the basis of Maimonides' usage of the phrase de 'ot ra'ot throughout the Mishneh Torah.90 It is not accidental that Maimonides brings the idea of holiness at the conclusion to a section dealing with food. Not only is the connection between food and holiness already found in the biblical source cited by Maimonides (Lev. 11, containing the list of forbidden foods) but it is central to Maimonides' entire approach to perfection. The connection between holiness and eating Intellects, though it appears to refer to their ontological status or to the perfection of their activity. 89. The translation is my own. I am indebted to Hannah Kasher's work for the reference to this passage and discussion of it. 90. See Laws of Character Traits 2:1; Laws of Repentance 4:5, 7:3, Laws of Sale 11:12; Laws of Ritual Baths 11:12, In all these passages, Maimonides employs de'ot ra'ot to refer unequivocally to character traits. Nor am I aware of any other occurrence of this phrase in the Mishneh Torah. In general, Maimonides more frequently uses the term de'ot to refer to traits than to intelligibles or intellects, though the latter usage is certainly not lacking.</page><page sequence="40">208 HOWARD KREISEL reappears in Maimonides' Book of Holiness. All the subjects appearing in that book concern eating, drinking, and intercourse. Moreover, in the conclusions to both Laws of Forbidden Intercourse (22:19) and Laws of Forbidden Foods (17:22), Maimonides explicitly attributes holiness respectively to all who restrain themselves in matters pertaining to intercourse, and to all who are diligent in the observance of the laws pertaining to eating and drinking. The full import of this point emerges from Maimonides' discussions of these three activities in the Guide, as well as his listing of these three activities as impeding intellection in the introduction to his Conmentatry on the Mishnah.9' Thus while Maimonides ties holiness to the noble character traits in general, it appears that it is most closely connected to the restraint of one's corporeal desires. Maimonides takes up the idea of holiness in several passages in the Guide. The connection between holiness and character traits in general appears in the conclusion to 1:54. For the utmost virtue of man is to become like unto Him, may He be exalted, as far as he is able; which means that we should make our actions like unto His, as the Sages made clear when interpreting the verse, You shall be holy (Lev. 19:2). They said: He is gracious, so be you also gracious; He is mercifidl, so be you also merciful. The purpose of all this is to show that the attributes ascribed to Him are attributes of His actions and that they do not mean that He possesses qualities. (p. 128) Here too holiness lies in attaining the noble traits. Insofar as these traits are attributes of action in reference to God, we may conclude that holiness is the notion characterizing the perfection of the totality of His activity. The specific connection between holiness and the restraint of the corporeal desires emerges from the third part of the Guide. Maimonides introduces his discussion of the problem of evil (3:8) with a description of the relation between matter and form, tracing all the various types of evil to matter. The individual requires matter for his existence but his task is to rule over it and quell its impulses. Maimonides praises those who regard all the impulses of matter as shameful and deficiencies, despite their necessity for human existence. Following Aristotle, he singles out those associated with the sense 91. Mishnah with the Commentary of R. Moses b. Mainmon: Seder Zera'im 42. See also Laws of Forbidden Intercourse 22:21.</page><page sequence="41">IMITATIO DEl IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 209 of touch-eating, drinking, and copulating."9 The perfect individual is one who practices these things as little as possible, restricting himself to what is indispensable for his existence, and feeling sorrow in the practice of them. It is the quelling of the corporeal impulses that enables one to attain apprehension of the metaphysical realm, which is the end of man. The ignorant, who are separated from God, are those who turn away from the contemplation of the intelligibles, taking instead as their end those impulses associated with the sense of touch. The idea of "holy" occurs several times in this chapter, all in relation to the quelling of the impulses of matter-particularly in regard to intercourse-to the degree that one does not even think of these matters. Maimonides cites the opinion that Elisha was called holy for never having a venereal dream,93 insofar as he never thought about intercourse at all. He maintains that it is inappropriate for us, by virtue of our being a "holy nation" (Exod. 19:6), to follow the practices of the Gentiles in speaking and reciting poems about matters concerning the sense of touch, particularly drinking and copulation. Moreover, Hebrew is known as the holy language because it has no word to designate either the male or female organ of copulation. This approach to holiness is reiterated in 3:33, in the section devoted to the reasons for the commandments. Maimonides posits as one of the purposes of the Law the restraint of corporeal desires as much as possible, once again singling out eating, drinking, and intercourse. In the continuation of his remarks he maintains, Similarly one of the intentions of the Law is purity and sanctification; I mean by this renouncing and avoiding sexual intercourse and causing it to be infrequent as possible .... Consequently He states clearly that sanctity consists in renouncing sexual intercourse,94 just as He also states explicitly that the 92. See also 2:36, 2:40, 3:33, 3:49. For the source in Aristotle, see Nicomachean Ethics III. 10.1118b. In 3:12, Maimonides treats concupiscence for eating, drinking, and copulating as the cause of all corporeal and psychical diseases. In his discussion of the virtues and vices in 3:8, Maimonides also introduces a Platonic motif. The virtues consist of intellectual apprehension, control of desire, and control of anger, corresponding to the tripartite Platonic division of the soul. 93. B.T. Berakhot 10b, Leviticus Rabbah 24:6. See II Kings 4:9. 94. Exod. 19:10, 19:15. It should be added that the command to be holy in Lev. 19:2 follows the list of forbidden relations. See Rashi's comment to the verse and Nahmanides' famous rejoinder. Overall, Nahmanides' approach has much in common with that of Maimonides. In Tanhunia edited by S. Buber, the command to be holy is juxtaposed with the prohibition against adultery (Kedoshint 3).</page><page sequence="42">210 HOWARD KREISEL giving-up of the drinking of wine constitutes sanctity, in what He says about the Nazarite: He shall be holy. (p. 533)95 Maimonides proceeds to cite the rabbinic view that holiness is attained by means of the commandments. Yet his entire discussion leaves no doubt that the connection between observance of the commandments and holiness resides in their purpose to restrain corporeal desires.96 Maimonides also speaks of holiness in 3:47, where he deals with the commandments concerning purity. Holiness is regarded by Maimonides as opposed to impurity in the three different senses in which the latter notion is used: disobedience to the commandments concerning action or opinion; dirt and filth; fancied notions (carrying certain things or being under the same roof with certain things). Maimonides does not enter into detail on the precise way holiness is opposed to impurity according to the third sense, or the second. From his discussion it appears that the holiness of the sanctuary is also a "fancied notion." As Maimonides explains in 3:35 in enumerating the class of commandments concerning,purity, "The purpose of all of them is in general to make people avoid entering the Sanctuary, so that it should be considered as great by the soul and feared and venerated" (p. 537). The fear of the sanctuary, as Maimonides elaborates in 3:45, brings about in turn a feeling of submission and servitude to God. Holiness in this sense does not refer directly to any human attribute, let alone divine attribute, but is an imaginary concept designed ultimately to strengthen the individual's obedience to God. 95. Num 6:5. Cf. Maimonides' remarks in 3:48. Maimonides' contradictory treatment of the Nazarite has been discussed by Jacob Levinger, "Abstinence from Alcohol in Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed" [Heb.], Bar-Ilan 4-5 (1967): 299-305. See also Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Mainonides (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), pp. 459-468; and my "Asceticism in the Thought of R. Bahya Ibn Paquda and Maimonides," Daat 21 (1988): xiii-xxii. 96. A hint of this view is already found in Maimonides' Book of the Commandments root 4. In commenting on the rabbinic notion, "You shall be holy-you shall be separate" (Sifra to Lev. 11:44), Maimonides indicates that one must separate oneself from all bad or disgusting (qabiz) things which God warned us against. The term qabih, as seen from Guide 3:33, is used as opposed to "holy" and "pure," particularly in reference to the commandments pertaining to drinking and intercourse. In general Maimonides employs qabih in the context of ethical traits and activities. For a discussion of the terms for "good" and "bad" in Maimonides' writings, see my "The Problem of 'Good' in the Philosophy of Maimonides" [Heb.], lyyun 38 (1989): 201-206.</page><page sequence="43">IMITATIO DEI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED 211 While Maimonides in his discussions of imitatio Dei connects holiness with God's attributes of action, his view of holiness in the context of human beings implies an even closer connection to God's "negative" attributes-a view already suggested by the rabbinic view of "holy" as "separate." Certainly the dominant motif characterizing Maimonides' discussions of God is the negation of corporeality. Maimonides' view of holiness as lying in the ethical virtues in general, and restraint of corporeal desires in particular, connects this notion with the negation of one's own corporeality, particularly that which is associated with the most corporeal of our senses. Just as God's being as the simple One, or as pure Intellect, stands opposed to any form of corporeality, including affections of the soul, so in man's goal to become pure intellect and join the incorporeal world he must gradually free (or "purify") himself from his corporeal nature, including all affections of the soul. It is this motif which characterizes Neoplatonic philosophy in general,97 and certainly lies at the foundation of Maimonides' approach to perfection.98 Yet in his discussion of holiness, Maimonides, interestingly, does not draw the connection between the incorporeality of God's "being" and man's "becoming." Overall, he shows little interest in the notion of holiness in reference to God. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Beersheva, Israel 97. See Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp. 185-200. 98. See, for example, Maimonides' description of Moses in Laws of the Principles of the Torah 7:6. "Therefore he separated himself from his wife forever, and from all that is similar to her [i.e., "corporeal needs"]. And his intellect was tied to the Rock of Eternity ... and he was sanctified like the angels." For Maimonides, however, it is not sufficient to negate one's corporeality in order to purify oneself. One must also make an active effort to perfect one's intellect by learning the order of the sciences. Raymond Weiss has recently pointed out the relation between holiness and the pursuit of truth in Maimonides' thought in Mainmonides' Ethics (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1991), pp. 153-155.</page></plain_text>
